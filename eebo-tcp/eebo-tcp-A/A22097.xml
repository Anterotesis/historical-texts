         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the worke of one of Our noble Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors</hi>
King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to conuert the Woolls of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
formerly vented raw, into Cloath, thereby to purchase vnto
Our louing Subiects the profite, arising aswell vpon the Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as vpon the Materiall, and to set Our owne people on worke
for their better sustentation and comfort; And it is likewise Our
desire, That it should be the worke of Our times, to ordaine and prouide, that all Broad
Cloathes may bee Died and Dressed within Our Kingdome before they bee Exported;
whereby aswell the second gaine of Manufacture, as the first, with all the incidents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
may come wholly to the benefit of Our louing Subiects, in whose riches and good estate
Wee shall alwayes thinke Ourselues rich and happy. Neither is the increase of profite
vpon this great Staple commoditie onely in Our Princely eye and cogitation; But Wee
foresee likewise, that when Our Cloathes shalbe Transported and dispersed by Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
immediatly into all the Markets of the world, where they are worne and vsed, it must
encrease exceedingly Our Nauigation and Nauie, so that not onely wealth, but honour,
strength and industrie will euidently follow vpon that which We propound to Our selues;
That as the Kings Our Progenitors, haue had the wisedome and Iudgement to see and
discerne the good that might come thereof; So neuerthelesse, either through difficultie or
misinformation, they haue not perfected, nor throughly pursued the worke intended, as may
appeare by the good and politique Lawes that haue bene Enacted concerning the same on
the one part, and the ancient and Inueterate Toleration and Dispensation with the saide
Lawes, which haue bene from time to time put in vre on the other part: Wee therefore
<unclear>being</unclear> desirous to aduance and perfect so excellent a worke, haue resolued to leaue no meanes
<pb facs="tcp:23824:2"/>
vnperformed, either by aduise of Parliament or otherwise of Our selues, which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
thereunto, by those safe degrees which in so great a worke are requisite; Wherein
though We finde no small difficulties, as it vseth to come to passe in the best workes, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in their beginnings, yet We doubt not but to ouercome the same without hazard or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience
vnto the present, for hope or desire of the future.</p>
            <p>And because opinion is sometime more harmefull then trueth, and that it may bee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some, that there may ensue some stand of Cloathes, whereby so many families of
Our louing Subiects are maintained, or at least, some fall of Prices, to the preiudice, both of
the Cloathier, and owner of Woolles in the meane time, betweene the diuerting of the old
course, and setling of the new: Wee doe therefore publish vnto all Our louing Subiects, by
these presents, that they shall not need to feare any such consequence, either in such stand of
Cloath, or abatement of Prices, as may be to their preiudice. And therefore, they may
<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>uce
this great and happy alteration to the better, without any interruption of Trade,
or pulling downe of Price in the meane time. Furthermore although we are setled in Our
resolution to effect this worke, yet would Wee not haue it construed that Wee haue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinion of the Company of Merchants Aduenturers, which haue long managed
the Trade of Cloathes vndressed, then as of those that haue wel deserued of Our state; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of any Our neighbours, who haue had correspondencie with them, and bought the
Cloath from them to serue the Markets abroad, then as of men, that were affected vnto the
good of their owne people, as it is naturall for men to be. Neither are Wee ignorant that
the state of Cloathing is at this time as flourishing and valuable as hath beene knowen;
but onely Wee are willing to aduance the Dowrie and Stocke of Our Kingdome: And
where Wee see apparent meanes of doing Our people further good, not to tie Our selues
to the simple and positiue degree of their welfare, but to proceed from good to better, and to
make posteritie beholding to Our times, for going through with that, whereof Our Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
haue onely sowen the seedes, and not hitherto reaped the fruits.</p>
