            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THere has been Two Books publish'd by Mr. <hi>James Owen</hi> Minister of a separate Congregation at <hi>Oswestry,</hi>

               </gap> I am under an Obligation and Promise of Replying unto. The <hi>Plea for Scripture Ordination,</hi> and the <hi>Tutamen Evangelicum alias Defence of the Plea.</hi> And though the time of their Publication might justly Require me to consider the <hi>Plea</hi> in the first Place, yet the Nature of the Argument forces me to Invert that Order, and to begin with <hi>the Defence.</hi> The Reason whereof is this. I had set out a small Book En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Tentamen Novum,</hi> or a new Essay proving the Divine Right of Episcopacy, the which engaged me to Answer some few things in <hi>the Plea,</hi> which concern that part of the Controversy between the Dissenters, and us of the Establish'd Church, <hi>viz. The Scripture</hi> Evidence. Hereupon <hi>Mr.</hi> O. Printed his <hi>Defence,</hi> endeavouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to overthrow my Hypothesis in the <hi>Tentamen Novum,</hi> and to Vindicate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> one by the Word of God. It is therefore necessary I should first of all Reply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Defence,</hi> that is, clear my Point about the Divine Right of Episcopacy. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> also manifest the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency of the old Hypothesis with the Scripture; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> descend to his numerous Testimonies drawn out of the Ecclesiastical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, in behalf of Presbyterian Parity which will be a full and proper Answer to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Accordingly I have cast this Book into two Parts: The first contains a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the <hi>Defence,</hi> except a few Testimonies of Antiquity, which are more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> reserv'd to the second Part, wherein I answer his Plea.</p>
            <p>In the management of this work the Reader must not expect that I should follow my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> step by step, in all the Sallies he has made into points nothing at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the Present Controversy, and involve my self into new Disputes before the Old one be done with. My purpose is to keep close to the Game, and not to run after every fresh Hare, Mr. O. is pleased to start. This would be an edless piece of Work, and swell this Book unto an Intolerable Bulk, which I design to draw into as narrow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass as I possibly can, and as the unreasonable Cavils of my Adversary will permit.</p>
            <p>Nor will I trouble my self or my Reader to take notice of all those snarling and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured Reflections which the <hi>Defence</hi> abounds with, without any Occasion given by me, that I am sensible of. 'Tis much better to neglect them, than weary my self and others
<pb facs="tcp:30465:3"/>
with Impertinent and Abusive Railery, which betrays the weakness of the Writer or his Cause, and hurts no Body, but the man from whom it <hi>proceeds.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. 15. 18.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless it will be necessary to remove some little of the Rubbish of both kinds out of the way, lest haply the World may be tempted to suspect me as Ignorant, and my Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as my Adversary has all along represented 'em. But when I have Vindicated my self in a few of the most material things of that Nature (if there be any such) the Ingenious Reader will I hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> perswaded that I am able, if I were as willing, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my self of the most trivial matters that are to be met with in the <hi>Defence.</hi> Only let it be noted that I intend not to mix these By. Disputes with the main Argument, which would be perplext thereby, and become more obscure; but to cast them into an Appendix by themselves at the end of every Chapter, as a separated Entertainment unto those, who shall have the Curiosity and Leisure to consult 'em, and which may be easily laid aside by such as have no Mind to trouble themselves with unnecessary Squabbles.</p>
            <p>In my Reply to the <hi>Defence</hi> and Vindication of my Hypothesis as also to the <hi>Plea,</hi> I will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my self with the Opinions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Authors, how Eminent soever they were or still are in the Church; that is I will not be sway'd or governed by them farther than my own reason conducted by the Word of God shall convince me, I am sensible that most (if not all) of the former writers engaged in this Controversy about Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, even many of the Episcopal party as well as the Dissenters for want of duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining, and understanding the Time of <hi>Paul's beseeching</hi> Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, have run themselves into such Labyrinths and Absurdities, that a Man might justly wonder they could ever sit down quietly and content themselves with their own Sentiments and Explications. I am verily perswaded there is not one Man in the World, that will allow himself the freedom of thinking, but would subscribe unto that Learned Prelate Dr. <hi>Pearson's</hi> Judgment in this cause, after 'tis once fully and fairly represented to him, except only such as are captivated by some powerful Interest, secret Pride, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in his <hi>Plea</hi> cited some <hi>Hundreds</hi> of Authorities in favour of Pres byterian Parity and Ordination. My design is not (as I said) to meddle with those, which are adduc'd out of Private and Modern Writers. All that is needful for me to do, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Primitive the Councils, especially the General ones, the Fathers and other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Ecclesiastical Writers, and the practice of the most Flourishing Catholick Churches of old unto the 5th Century or thereabouts, and to examine whether my Adversary has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> any one good Testimony for himself and Brethren, out of these Monuments of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
<pb facs="tcp:30465:3"/>
If he has not (as I hope will be made appear) there is an end of his <hi>Plea</hi> (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) especially, when such a Cloud of Witnesses which of necessity fall in our way as we Travel through the History of those times, will rise up against him within the Compass of the 4 or 5, first Ages aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Before I make an end of this Preface I thought it needful to prepare the Reader with a short account of my whole Hypothesis, which if kept in Memory as he goes will be some ease and advantage to him. He must remember then, that all Authors I know of (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept haply the Rhemists who so far as I see spoke but at Random) writing upon the Present Subject or commenting upon the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> have asserted or at least taken for granted (till very lately) that the time of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> beseeching Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>when he went into</hi> Macedonia, is somewhere to be search'd for in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, before St. <hi>Paul</hi> had the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders Farewel in Acts 20. v. 17. from whence our Dissenters conclude, that the supreme Government of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was not in that Epistle committed unto <hi>Timothy:</hi> For that the Apostle could not have so wholly overlook'd their Bishop in that Farewel Sermon, and applied himself only to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to whom he commended the care and oversight of that Church.</p>
            <p>On the other hand I have shew'd that the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was wrote long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Paul's</hi> said Farewel Sermon, even after his enlargement out of his former Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by consequence, that he <hi>besought</hi> Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>when he went unto</hi> Macedonia, at another time, than what has hitherto been believ'd and assigned. And so that Objection just now mentioned quite vanishes.</p>
            <p>Thus then my Hypothesis lies. After that Schism at <hi>Corinth</hi> had been in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure though not intirely allay'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he with all hast made towards <hi>Jerusalem</hi> taking <hi>Miletus</hi> in his way, where he bad the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders Farewel. At <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> he was Imprisoned and thence sent to <hi>Rome</hi> in Bonds. Here he continued two years and upwards writing Epistles to the several Churches, of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> of <hi>Philippi, of Coloss,</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> and to <hi>Philemon.</hi> Being at length set at Liberty, and in his way as he went back Eastward to visit the foresaid Churches, he laid the Foundation of a Church in <hi>Crete,</hi> leaving <hi>Titus</hi> behind to finish and to govern it. Thence as I suppose he prosecuted his Journey <hi>to Judea, Heb.</hi> 13. 23. and thence as it were, back again through <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a.</hi> Being at <hi>Troas</hi> (2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13.) about to sail unto <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> he <hi>besought</hi> Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Ephesus. shortly after, when in <hi>Macedonia</hi> haply or <hi>Greece</hi> or somewhere thereabouts, he wrote this first Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> giving him the necessary Orders, how he was to behave himself in the Charge lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to him, and not long after from <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> that Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> upon the same Subject. Hence forward we hear no more of him in Scripture saving that being once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain got to <hi>Rome,</hi> he thence wrote his second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> as is undeniably evinc'd in these Papers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schism, like the Leprosy, seemed incurable, and spread its self unto other Churches also, particularly <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as may be gathered from the Epistle to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi> and the first to <hi>Timothy:</hi> And the like I reckon to have happened in other places also. Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> in his Visitation of the Eastern Churches before spoken of, his Principal design (I presume) was to compose the Contentions already risen, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them for the future. To which end he committed the Government of the Churches to single Persons, of <hi>Crete</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Timothy:</hi> The like being to be believed of the Rest of the Apostles, and Churches throughout the World: For how else could there have been Bishops <hi>every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>where,</hi> as <hi>Ignatius</hi> writes to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:30465:4"/>
not one Church at that time governed by a Presbytery of Elders only without an Apostle, or Bishop presiding over them, that we can find in Ecclesiastical History?</p>
            <p>Nor are we to imagin this a perfectly new device taken up by <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apostles meerly upon the Occasion of the Schisms at <hi>Corinth</hi> and elsewhere. For as I make account they came to this Resolution among themselves even at the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> to commit the Government of the Churches unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Persons: Not that they immediately did so assoon as they had made the Decree: For every Apostle ('tis likely) kept the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Care of the Churches by him founded in his own Hands, so long as he thought fit and was able to manage them himself: So that every Church was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cast into this Platform, nor furnish'd with a Bishop distinct from the Apostles at the same instant; but 'twas done <hi>paulatim,</hi> as <hi>Jerom</hi> speaks in his Commentary on <hi>Titus. James</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> before the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schism, <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> at that Church's first Plantation, though <hi>Timothy</hi> was not so of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> till many Years after the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Church had been formed. But at length because Schisms began now to increase, and prevail, the Apostles taking the Alarm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to put their former Decree into Execution, and more especially because at this time believers were multiplyed, Churches were increased, business grew on their Hands, and they forced to be long Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and unable to inspect all Churches: As also because the time of their Departure now drew on apace, 'twas therefore high time, and necessary to provide for the Peace and future Government of the Church, as they had in the beginning contrived.</p>
            <p>Whereas then I have frequently express'd my self as if the Church Government had been <hi>alter'd</hi> from what it was in the Infancy of Christianity, and lest this should be taken for a rash and dangerous Concession to the Adversaries in prejudice of Episcopacy, I thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my self. 1. This was not a Change of the first Principle and Rule of Government, but only a bringing it by Degrees to that Model and Frame, which the Apostles (as I said) first pitched upon, and afterward, as Occasion required, by degrees brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. So that with respect to the Original design and Scheme of Government there was indeed no change or Innovation at all. But then, 2. If we consider matter of Fact, there was an <hi>Alteration</hi> of Government, in as much as the Apostles having left it for a while unto the Presbyters, to discharge the Ordinary affairs of the Churches in their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but still reserving to themselves the Power of Ordination, and other matters of greatest Moment, at length constituted Bishops over them, pursuant to their Prime Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and in Conformity to their own way of Government, which was <hi>Prelatical.</hi> In this latter Sense I would always be understood; and this <hi>Change</hi> was nothing else but an improvement and completing the Church Government, as it had been from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning projected by themselves or rather suggested to them by the Holy-Ghost.</p>
            <p>I must also here take notice of one thing more, which is not sufficiently explained in its proper place. It being acknowledg'd that Presbyters were subject and accountable unto the Apostles, and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> (as I argu'd) not Supreme Governours of the Churches, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> retorts that Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>and all Bishops also in the Apostles Days were so, and by the same consequence not Supreme Governours.</hi> But I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis true <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus (Paul</hi> being alive) were subject and accountable to him, and so not absolutely Supreme Rulers, if we look up towards the Apostles, but if we look downward to the Presbyters they were Supreme, or which is the same to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Superiour to the Presbyters, who were subject to the Bishops. 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> and. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> were not (in <hi>Paul's</hi> life time) actually Supreme Governours, as if they had no Superiour; for <hi>Paul</hi> was over them: True! Yet they were Supreme intentionally even
<pb facs="tcp:30465:4"/>
whilst the Apostle was alive and actually after his decease. For so they must needs of course be. 3. There is a great difference between <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> subjection, and accountableness unto the Apostles, and that of the Presbyters. The Presbyters (as I have shew'd and as far as we know) did nothing without the express command and special directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apostles, I mean in the higher and most important business of the Churches: But <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (and so the rest) had general Rules only prescrib'd 'em, and were Ordinarily left to their own Discretionary Power in the Execution of them, as is evident from the Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> except the Apostle in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner interposed sometimes, as we may reasonably admit. But there is <hi>nec vola nec vestigium,</hi> no footsteps in the whole Scripture of any such general Rules and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Power committed to the Presbyters as is evinc'd in <hi>T. N.</hi> and these Papers.</p>

               <p>THE Rector in his Preface to the <hi>T. N.</hi> complained of the unfair way which the Dissenters have taken up in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Controversies, that is, of their bringing in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nothing at all belonging to the Point in debate; which is as when a Lawyer, when he is pleading the Cause of his Client, and setting forth his Title unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in Question, should fall foul upon his Clients Adversary, exposing his Person and upbraiding him with his private, perhaps, but suppos'd Faults and Infirmities. I instanc'd in three things, which are the common <hi>Topicks</hi> of the Dissenters railing against the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Clergy, and which they will be sure to hook in, whatever the Matter in Controversy be. But if recrimination be but cavilling (as one of their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors speaks) much more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Accusing. My Instances were, That the Episcopal Divines are Arminians, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> Symbolizes with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; That the Bishops are <hi>proud Lords, and Lordly Prelates.</hi> And if all this were true, what does it signify in the Question about Church-Government?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. O.</hi> In the Contents of his first <hi>Chap.</hi> at the beginning, Advertises his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that, <hi>The Dissenters are justified in their way of mannaging Controversies.</hi> Indeed he should have edeavour'd it, if he would have answer'd to the purpose, and his way of Vindicating the Dissenters, should have been (I conceive) either to deny the charge laid against'em, or else to justify the fitness and reasonableness of that way of controverting. But instead of this, he falls upon the old strain of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us (the Rector) of Arminianism, of Symbolizing with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops for being <hi>Lords,</hi> which is nothing to the Question between him and me here, <hi>viz. Whether it be fair to charge ones Adversary with supposed faults, which have no relation to the Question in hand,</hi> unless he is so vain as to imagin, that his own repeated practice, is a sufficient justification of the Dissenters managing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.</p>
               <p>In giving an Account of the Nature of our Church-Government, I observ'd in general, <hi>That our Episcopal Government is establish'd upon certain Canons and Laws, made and consented unto by the Convocation, consisting of Bishops and Presbyters, and by the multitude of Believers; That is, by their Representatives in Parliament, and that, thus it was in the Council of Jerusalem,</hi> Acts 15. This is plain matter of Fact, and one would have thought incapable of being cavill'd at; and yet Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> who is a Master at that knack, has many things to oppose me in it, and has found many disparities in the Resemblance.

               <p>The things enjoyn'd by the Apostles (excepting Fornication) were not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary before they were enjoyn'd, but only Charitably and Prudentially necessary: And so our few Ceremonies too were and still are, Charitably and Prudentially necessary, which was the Reason of their being enjoin'd at first, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd amongst us.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> did not <hi>widen the door of Church-Fellowship</hi> (as <hi>Mr. O.</hi> asserts) but made it straighter, if the matters here spoken of, can be said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto Church-Fellowship. The Gentile Believers had a Natural right to <hi>eat bloud, things strangled, and things offer'd unto Idols,</hi> when sold in the Market: But the Apostles depriv'd 'em of this Liberty, commanding them to Symbolize with the Jews in the forbearance of 'em. And I would know a Reason, why in a few matters of Indifference, Decency and Solemnity, it is not Lawful for the Church-Governours, now to restrain the Liberty of Believers. I say in some few things out of Charity to many Foreign Protestants, who have Ceremonies, and to the Primitive Christians, which were not without 'em, even as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles restrain'd the Liberty of the Gentile Believers in Charity to the Jews? And why is it not as Lawful for us to Symbolize with the Primitive Christians, and our Foreign Brethren-Protestants, as the Apostles with the Jews.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mr. O.</hi> goes on, <hi>The Council of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>freed the Christians from the Yoke of Circumcision.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But it put on them those three <hi>Yokes</hi> aforesaid. Besides as the Apostles freed the Christians from Circumcision, or rather declar'd them free from it: for they were never under that bondage: so did the Convocation free us from all Superstition and Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>The Apostles (he adds) asserted that Christian Liberty, which Jesus Christ purchased and obliged us to maintain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> And yet the Apostles took away the Gentiles Liberty in the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd. The Text of Scripture here cited, has a false construction put upon it. The Liberty there spoken of, is not a Liberty not to do any thing, which is in its own Nature indifferent, no not a Liberty from all the smaller Observations of the Law; for then the Apostles could not have enjoin'd the forbearance of the three things, nor could <hi>Paul</hi> have Preach'd and Urg'd, the observation of those Decrees, as he did, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4. But 'tis the Liberty from the bondage of Circumcision, which made Men <hi>Debtors to the whole</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. v. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Law,</hi> and to every Ceremony thereof.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He complains of the number of our Canons, whereas (says<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 25.</note> he) <hi>the Apostles at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>made none new, and continued but a few which were obliging before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That these three Canons made by the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> were new to the Gentile Believers, is out of all question, tho' <hi>Mr. O.</hi> affirms the contrary; not new; as if they had never been known or heard of before; but they were, I say, new to the Gentile Believers, who were not before oblig'd to the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30465:6"/>
of'em, tho' <hi>Mr. O.</hi> says they were. But whereas the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> continued (made) <hi>but a few Canons;</hi> 'tis true: nevertheless at other times, and at other places, they might have made more than threescore for any thing we know. The code of the Universal Church, consists of two Hundred and seven Canons: yet they were made at several<note place="margin">See <hi>Justellus.</hi>
                  </note> times, and in several Places: Even so, though the Apostles at this time and at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> made but three Canons, yet at other times, and in other places they might have made more, and did so, as we may Learn from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. wherein (I think) we meet with several Canons, as from those words of St. <hi>Paul, The rest will I set in order when I come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 14. And again, <hi>Hold the Traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word or our Epistle.</hi> 2 Thes. 2. 15. <hi>That thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting,</hi> Tit. 1. 5.</p>

                     </hi> nor Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications against the breaker of their Canons, they only concluded 'em with these gentle words, <hi>from which if you keep your selves, ye shall do well.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Well! and the Gentile Believers readily obey'd the Apostles Decrees without more ado, not stubbornly clamouring for <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Liberty wherewith Christ had made 'em free.</hi> For Christ had made the Gentile Christians free from the three Canons of the Apostles, as well as from Circumcision. But <hi>doing well</hi> was an effectual motive in those days unto Obedience, though not in these Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Times of ours. If the punishment annext unto Canons be now more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere than ordinary, it is because some Men are more Stiff and Refractory, more Disobedient and Unpeaceable than the Gentile Believers were of old.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Mr. O.</hi> adds, <hi>The Canons of Jerusalem were made by the Apostles, Elders and the whole Church: But ours by the Bishops and Presbyters in Convocation, which are the true Church of England by representation,</hi> by which he thinks to destroy the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, because the Multitude of Believers were not present at the making our Canons, as they were at the making of those at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> To obviate this Exception, I observ'd that our Canons were consented unto, or confirmed and receiv'd, by the Multitude of Believers, that is, by their representatives in Parliament. But <hi>Mr. O.</hi> having nothing else to cavil at, or wherewith he might invalidate the Parallel, which is so much to the advantage of our Church, and fatal to the Dissenters, corrupts my words, and by way of gloss adds, <hi>To the Multitude of Believers, that is</hi> (says he) <hi>the Church.</hi> I say, and say it again, that the Parliament represents the Multitude of Believers, but I never said, <hi>That is the Church,</hi> nor any thing like it. This Invention was hammer'd out at <hi>Mr. O'</hi>s own Forge, whence an abundance of the same kind have been uttered. All the colour he has for thus misrepresenting me, is, that <hi>I make the Bishops to answer the Apostles, the Presbyters, the Elders;</hi> therefore I must make <hi>the Parliament to answer the whole Church.</hi> And so I do: yet this will do <hi>Mr. O.</hi> no service. For that expression, <hi>The whole Church,</hi> in the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Act.</hi> 22. is not so exact, but will need a little explanation on this Occasion. These words then the <hi>Whole Church</hi> cannot be understood strictly: for the <hi>whole Church</hi> here must be distinguish'd from the Apostles and Elders: but surely these also were part of the whole Church properly speaking. The words then are meant of the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Believers</hi> (they are call'd the <hi>Multitude, v.</hi> 12.) and in contradistinction to the Apostles and Elders, and therefore I avoided saying, <hi>The whole Church,</hi> and chose to express my self thus. <hi>The Multitude of Believers,</hi> I am, then I flatter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30465:7"/>
my self pretty safe from <hi>Mr. O.</hi> and my Diocesan too, were he (what he is far from being) the most severe and haughty Prelate in Christendom.</p>
               <p>Because it is a common Objection against the Church of <hi>England'</hi>s Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Parish Priests have no power of Discipline,</hi> I asserted that, <hi>They have power to rebuke and admonish, and to suspend for a while from the Lord's Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And so</hi> (says Mr. O.) <hi>have private Persons power to rebuke and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish,</hi>

                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 26.</note> Lev. 19. 17. Col. 3. 16. As if <hi>Mr. O.</hi> never heard of that common and receiv'd distinction between fraternal, private, or charitable Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and that which is publick and Ministerial, and Authoritative.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Well! but as for our power of suspending, he alledges 'tis but for fourteen days, and after that the Sinner is left to the Ordinary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Ay! Here we have the bottom of the Dissenting Ministers Design out. They would be all so many little Popes, from whom there lies no appeal. The very Men who decry Tyranny, are setting up for Arbitrary Government, and will not endure that in another, which they aspire to themselves. All I shall reply unto him is, to present him with the judgment of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Beza;</hi> and I hope <hi>Mr. O.</hi> will lend both his Ears unto these two Presbyterian O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. The former affirms — <hi>That to trust Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>

                  <hi>Ministers proceed no further than Admonition: but in case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, they certify the Presbytery of the City.</hi> It is certain the power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is in the hands of the Magistrates of that City.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Mr. O.</hi> further objects, <q>That we have no power to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 27.</note> judge whom to Baptize, but must Baptize all that are offer'd, though Children of Jews, Infidels, Deists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is nothing to the present Question between us, which is whether <hi>our Parish Priests have any Power of Discipline.</hi> They may have some power, tho' not this. And that they have some power, to wit of Ministerial Admonition, and Suspension from the Lords Supper, has been already asserted and prov'd, I presume, yea, and granted also. This then is a new and impertinent Subject, thrust in here meerly to make a noise and dust with, and to avoid the thorough discussion of the Point in hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Dissenting Ministers, have a greater power than we have, or pretend to, 'tis confest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to refuse whomsoever they please, even the Children of the most upright Believers. They are responsible to no Law, nor to any Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that I know of, in case of refusal, nor to any punishment. Only perhaps the parties aggriev'd will withdraw their Contributions. But upon these terms we also have a power to Judge whom we will, and whom we will not Baptize: 'tis-but venturing the loss of our Livings, as they must of their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Mr. O.</hi> Supposes here, what cannot easily be believ'd ever did, or will happen, <hi>viz.</hi> that Jewish; or Gentile, or Theistical Parents, will offer their Children unto Christian Baptism, or suffer others to bring 'em to that Holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Perhaps the Children of very wicked Christians are brought to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. These we acknowledge we have not power to refuse: for so we know,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30465:7"/>
that the Children of wicked Jews were to be admitted unto Circumcision, in the room whereof our Lord introduc'd Baptism: and we are perswaded the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is the Rule and Pattern of the latter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If it should so happen that the Child of a Jew, or Turk, or Infidel, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Excommunicated, or Theift, or Atheift should be put into our Hands to be Baptized, 'tis confest we take our selves oblig'd to Baptize 'em: but 'tis with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> that there be sufficient <hi>Susceptors,</hi> or Persons who will undertake to bring 'em up in the Christian Religion. And of the sufficiency of these Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we are the judges, except an Appeal be made from us unto our Diocesian, who may over-rule us if he sees just cause for it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. and Lastly, How the Apostles and Presbyters, in the Apostles days ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd themselves in the Point of Infant-Baptism; <hi>Mr. O.</hi> should have done well, first to have stated it out of the New Testament, before he brought this excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. O.</hi> further objects — <hi>That we have no power to forbear giving the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a Notorious Offender, unless we prosecute him in the Bishops Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Reader may apply the Two first Answers, to the former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection unto this, whereby he'll see how Frivolous and Impertinent it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Mr. O.</hi> Should have excepted thus, <hi>save for fourteen days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a most false and wicked saying, that of <hi>Mr. O'</hi>s — <q>That if he be absolv'd in the Court, we must give him the Eucharist, though we know him never so Impenitent.</q> We cannot know a Mans impenitency except him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self declares it, either by his Words or Actions, and continuing in his Sins. In either case I can forbear giving him the Lords Supper, and in fourteen days cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify as before. Nay, by Canon 109, I am not to admit him to the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, till he is reform'd, and of this I am the Judge.</p>
               <p>I cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> but this method is <hi>troublesome,</hi> &amp;c. but it is not <hi>odious</hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Eyes of good Men, nor is it possible to be <hi>fruitless,</hi> if the Parish-Priest is resolute. The Ordinary cannot relieve the Impenitent Sinner, nor compel the Priest to admit him. This course is indeed rarely undertaken, and that because (as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd) if one warn a Wicked Person, one that is scandalously so, he'll be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure not to offer himself, left he be turn'd back and publickly disgrac'd in the Face of the Congregation. The method is as I have said troublesom: but better a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief than an inconvenience. Better many Sinners be admited, than one good Man rejected. If the Parish Priest should have it in his own Power and Breast to abstain, whom he pleas'd, and for as long time as he thought fit without Liberty to appeal, his private Revenge, or the influence of the Parties Enemies, might engage him to deprive a good Man, of the comfort of that Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. I have an Instance of this kind ready at hand, a late one, and in my Neighbourhood. <q>A Member of the Congregation, had given Evidence in behalf of a Church-Man against a Dissenter. No Body objected against his Testimony as false, 'Twas thought rather favourable to the Dissenter. At his return from the Assizes, a Message was brought him by some of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, that he was to forbear coming to the Communion, he was also repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Minister, for giving Evidence against a Brother, the <hi>Sub-poena</hi> being not actually, though ready be to serv'd upon him, in case he refus'd to go without it.</q> This was not Commutation, I acknowledge, which we hear of so oft, but it was base Corruption, <hi>and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be punish'd by the Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:30465:8"/>Yet <hi>Mr. O.</hi> goes on, and tells me — <q>We have no power to call persons to Repentance openly before the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> As much as <hi>Mr. O.</hi> has. He or I may call 'em to Publick Penance: but 'tis at their choice, whether they will obey us. Such Penitents are but like Mr. <hi>Baxter'</hi>s Christians, <hi>meer Volunteers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, he urges that, <hi>we have no power to judge any Man to be Excommunicated, nor to absolve 'em.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Mr. O.</hi> is so fond of the Power of judging, that 'tis a Thousand pities he was not bred a Lawyer, that so in good time he might have been <hi>My Lord Judge:</hi> for I suppose he has no exception against a Temporal Lordship. But it falls out to his great mortification, that in the Post he is in, though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be a Judge, yet he is but a Cryer, the Mouth of his Congregation, and ecchos their Sentence of Excommunication, and that of Absolution also. How can he do less, since he eats their Bread, wears their Livery, and is their Stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary. I produc'd him an Example of this kind just now. But that we have power to judge and absolve, is manifest in<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Office of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Sick.</hi>
                  </note> the case of Dying Persons, confessing their Sins and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Absolution.</p>
               <p>In a word, we are not asham'd of the name Priest, though we are sensible the Dissenters, oft call us so out of contempt: and we are asham'd of their folly in upbraiding us with a Title, which the holy Scripture has given us.</p>

Chap.</hi> 19. of <hi>Timothy'</hi>s Ordination spoken of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Epis.</hi> 21. 6. and not known when nor in what place given him: of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the Incestuous Person unto <hi>Satan.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and of the Council of <hi>Jerusalem, Ast.</hi> 15. Now 'tis all one to me, and to my design in this Chapter, what becomes of the four first Instances, and of that other in the 19<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Acts,</hi> whether they were Ordinations or not. If not, let <hi>Mr. Prinn</hi> look to it, or <hi>Mr. O.</hi> in his behalf. As they will do me no good, so they can do me no harm. Though if they should prove Ordinations, the advantage I made of 'emis of some moment in the Question before us, they being perform'd either by Apostles, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30465:8"/>
Prophets, no other inferior and ordinary Church Officer joining with 'em, which was what I level'd at against <hi>Mr. Prinn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the first uncontroverted Ordination unto the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, is that of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul, Act.</hi> 13<hi>th.</hi> This Ordination was had by <hi>Prophets and Teachers,</hi> who receiv'd an express and extraordinary Commission from God, to separate these two unto the work <hi>whereunto</hi> (says the Holy Ghost) <hi>I have called them.</hi> Seeing then Prophets, as Superiour, and extraordinary Species of Church Officers, influenc'd by the immediate and express Command of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost; presided over this work of Separating <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> it can be no sufficient warrant nor Precedent unto meer Presbyters, to Ordain by Virtue of their Ordinary Power and Office. Herein lies the force of my Observation, which ought to have been fairly answered.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Mr. O.</hi> instead of this falls a cavilling, at my expounding<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>Prophets and Teachers,</hi> the same Persons that is, ordinary Ministers (or Presbyters) endu'd at that time with the Gift of Prophesy, or receiving a Special Commission from Heaven. <hi>Whereas He will needs have 'em distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Officers: Prophets and Teachers in</hi> Sensu Diviso.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I will not here deny but <hi>Mr. O'</hi>s interpretation <hi>may</hi> be true, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I see any thing hinders but mine <hi>may</hi> be so. For <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was but an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary (though the supreme) Officer in the Church of the Jews, and yet he prophesy'd, and by Consequence <hi>pro hâc vice</hi> was a Prophet. If a Man would have describ'd him, it had not been improper to have said, he was <hi>a Prophet and the High <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, how to compromise this small difference between us, I know not. I'll therefore suppose what <hi>Mr. O.</hi> takes for granted, (though at the same time I think the contrary is most evident, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> at least being both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Teachers;) the <hi>Prophets</hi> there spoken of, were Persons different from the <hi>Teachers.</hi> Yet if it be so, my Argument is not alter'd, nor ever the worse: still the <hi>Teachers</hi> were presided over by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and still the Ordainers acted by Special and extraordinary Commission from Heaven, which cannot warrant ordinary Presbyters and Teachers, to Ordain by Virtue of their ordinary Power. If <hi>Mr. O.</hi> himself, or any Layman, should ordain some Person by Special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God appointed thereunto, no body could with Reason call his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into Question. But then this could not rationally be drawn into exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor justify every private Believer in <hi>England,</hi> to ordain at his own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>It is not Material, whether the Revelation was immediately given to the <hi>Teachers,</hi> or to the <hi>Prophets</hi> only, and by them unto the <hi>Teachers:</hi> nevertheless I think <hi>Mr. O.</hi> ought not to deny the former. The words run thus — <hi>And they</hi> (the Prophets and Teachers) <hi>Ministred unto the Lord and fasted, and the Holy Ghost said, Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>&amp;c. and when they had fasted, and prayed, and laid their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> on them, they sent 'em away.</hi> They who sent <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> away, were the same that separated them by imposition of hands, and they who separated <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> were the Persons to whom the Holy Ghost spake, and they to whom the Holy Ghost spake, were the Persons, that Ministred unto the Lord and fasted; and they who Ministred unto the Lord and fasted, were the <hi>Teachers</hi> as well as the <hi>Prophets.</hi> Therefore the Revelation was communicated immediately to the <hi>Teachers,</hi> therefore the <hi>Teachers</hi> were <hi>Prophets</hi> also: therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30465:9"/>
this is no Precedent unto common Presbyters, to ordain by virtue of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power; by consequence my Argument holds good.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Ordinations spoken of <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. I noted that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> acted not therein, by any Special Revelation, but by their Apostolical Power, being not assisted therein by any Presbyters; that therefore these cannot be good Presidents for Presbyterian Ordination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. O.</hi> Replies that, <hi>this Instance makes little for me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 74.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It makes thus much for me, that it makes nothing for the Dissenters, nor against me, which is what I design'd by it: though I might say it is a plain Instance of Ordination, by Church Officers, Superiour to Presbyters.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Mr. O'</hi>s reason why <hi>Philip</hi> did not lay hands on with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> viz. because it was no Ordination, but conferring the extraordinary Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which <hi>Philip</hi> could not do, <hi>Mr. O.</hi> forgot to take notice of the whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but Answers it by halves. I urg'd, that <hi>Philip</hi> had the extraordinary and Miraculous Gift of the Spirit, which was usually conferred by Imposition of hands. that though he had this Gift, yet he could not give it: that therefore they who have a Gift, yet may not have power to conferr that Gift; and by consequence, that those Persons who are ordain'd to the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, it does not follow that they can Ordain, which was the thing to be prov'd.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that I perceive meriting any Reply until we come to that piece of Discipline, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. where we read of the Incestuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> Excommunicated (as I contend) by the Authority and Command of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Mr. O.</hi> insinuates, that the Apostle <hi>reproves the</hi> Corinthians<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 79.</note> 
                  <hi>for not excommunicating the Sinner themselves,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This verse proves it not. The expression is in the Passive <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>— That the Offender <hi>might be taken away.</hi> By whom? Why not by the Apostle? He may as well be thought to chide 'em, for not informing him of the misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, to the end, the Offender might be delivered unto <hi>Satan</hi> by St. <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The whole Story as we shall shew Countenances this Interpretation.</p>
               <p>Ay, but (says the Minister) <hi>the Apostle enjoins the</hi> Corinthians <hi>to avoid disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walkers,</hi> v. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But this is by the Apostles express commandment still. Besides <hi>to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from among themselves that wicked Person,</hi> is not to deliver him to <hi>Satan,</hi> or to expel him the Church, but <hi>Not to eat with him,</hi> v. 11. that is, not to have any Familiarity with him, in civil Conversation. In this the Apostle does indeed declare, <hi>v.</hi> 12. that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had power to <hi>Judge,</hi> with whom they might be Familiar, and with whom not; But it does not hence follow they had power to Excommunicate. Now that it was St. <hi>Paul</hi> who judged and decreed, and gave theSentence of Excommuncation against the Offender, will appear plainly, if we read the first part of the 3<hi>d</hi> verse, with the 5<hi>th v.</hi> (for all the rest is a <hi>Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>) Thus then let us put 'em close together, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>For I verily, as absent in Body, but present in Spirit, have determined already</hi> (then v. 5.) <hi>to deliver such an one unto Satan.</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so the Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion most certainly proceeded from the Apostle. It is also worthy consideration, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did not receive again into their Communion, this Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Person, until the Apostle had absolved him, and then besought them to confirm their Love towards him. 2 <hi>C.</hi> 28. 10.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:30465:9"/>In the next place I am accused of altering and perverting the Text. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> heavy charge, which ought not to be passed over lightly. The Accusation is, that <hi>v.</hi> 4. I have put the Words thus, <hi>Of my Spirit,</hi> whereas the Translators leaving out <hi>of,</hi> render the place thus, <hi>My Spirit,</hi> not <hi>Of my Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Since the Grammatical construction will bear it, there is no reason of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing me of perverting the Text. Now <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, being put absolute and into a Parenthesis. Upon this supposition, then, thus the Words, may be laid — <hi>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and my Spirit</hi> (or <hi>of my Spirit</hi>) which is the same thing) <hi>when ye are gathered together,</hi> &amp;c. So that <hi>Mr. O.</hi> could not have any just pretense for his Accusation, whatever becomes of my Interpretation of the Text. This, perhaps he may call into Question: and my purpose now is to vindicate it.</p>
               <p>I cannot reconcile my self unto that Opinion, which Couples <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thus more plainly in English — <hi>When ye and my Spirit are gathered together. Paul</hi> was now at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> both Body and Spirit. I can form no Idea of his Spirit assembling with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. True, he tells 'em, that he is <hi>present</hi> (with 'em) <hi>in Spirit,</hi> but Corrects himself immediately <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>As though I were present.</hi> So that the Sense is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> was present with 'em, in Heart and Affections, studying their welfare, wishing them well, and praying that their Souls might be Saved, and their Church Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in Peace and Purity. Or, why not present among 'em by his Authority? As we say, the King is every where present in his Dominions, by his Influence and Providence. But that the Spirit of <hi>Paul</hi> should be gathered, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled with the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Congregation, is a too harsh and improper Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, at least in my Fancy and Opinion, especially, since so Commodious and agreeable Sense may be given of the Words. Nor let any one suspect me to have advanced this Interpretation to serve a cause which stands in no need of it. For if it shall still be thought that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> are to be coupled, then the latter Words must import the Apostles Authority, (as I formerly expounded it): And least the Apostle should seem too assuming, in thus insisting on his own 'Authority, with great caution he adds — <hi>With the Power of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> As if he had said, <hi>my Authority, but in Conjunction with, and subordination to the Power of Christ.</hi> For so the Apostle was wont oftimes carefully to prevent mistakes, left he should be thought to haveUsurpt his Power. Thus he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. speaking of his Authority, adds, <hi>Which the Lord hath given us,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 10. (which comes nearer to our purpose) when he had granted the Absolution of the Excommunicated Person, <hi>I forgave it</hi> (says he) <hi>in the Person of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the whole matter, thus much, at least, may be said of this Instance of Ecclesiastical Discipline, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> directed and commanded it, which is all I need to be concerned for. For then it can be no president for a College of Presbyters, much less for a particular Minister of one single Congregation, to Excommunicate, which was the thing I intended to Evince.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> At what time? The natural sense is, that at the time of St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s writing this Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he was then an Apostle, that's undeniable.

and there expresly called thereunto by God. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Separate me</hi> Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work, whereunto I have called them,</hi> that is, to the Apostleship of the Gentiles. Hereunto <hi>Paul</hi> (I conceive) alludes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. and in other places, where he speaks of his being called to the Apostleship by God.</p>
               <p>For the further confirmation, therefore, of my own Opinion, I offer unto consideration, that there is little recorded of his success in Preaching the Gospel, from the time of his <hi>Conversion,</hi> to that of his <hi>Separation</hi> (which was about Eleven Years) that his old name of <hi>Saul</hi> was all that while continu'd unto him, and he is never once called Apostle. That after his separation, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. all his Labours are Remembred exactly, and his wonderful success recorded, his name was immediately changed into <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 13. 9. and the Title of Apostle given him. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 4. 14. Yet I am prest with that Passage, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 18. 21. where our Lord appeared unto him in the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> saying — <hi>Make haste, get thee quickly out of</hi> Jerusalem, v. 18. <hi>for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles:</hi> and this was before his Ordination, mentioned, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But this was long after his Conversion, and therefore shews, that he was not the Apostle of the Gentiles from the beginning, God having not as yet sent him. This interview between Jesus Christ and <hi>Paul,</hi> was at his being at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> spoken of, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 18. as I conceive, and happened (I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) before his Separation, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. But let us mind the Words — <hi>I will send thee:</hi> The Lord did not then actually send him, but promised that he would hereafter send him to the Gentiles. And the performance of this promise <hi>Paul</hi> doubtless waited for, as the other Apostles did, another promise of the like Nature, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4. 8. As this latter promise was afterward made good to the Twelve, on the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> so was the former unto <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>It remains then very probable, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a Minister of the Word, before he was an Apostle, that he was twice Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">

               <p>Before I dismiss this, I will for once take notice of a most disingenuous and deceitful Remark of my Adversaries, when he thus informs his<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 84.</note> Reader — <hi>The Rector</hi> (says he) <hi>allows that</hi> Timothy <hi>was made a Presbyter by Presbyters,</hi> which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> cannot but know, is false; <hi>By Presbyters.</hi> (when I say so) 'tis manifest, and I oft enough declared, that I understood such Presbyters as Ordained <hi>Timothy,</hi> but had Special, Divine and Extraordinary Commission from God thereunto, or else in Conjunction with, and Subordination to some extraordinary Prophet presiding over them: but not by Virtue of their own single ordinary Power: That, therefore this Instance cannot be drawn into Consequence; I observe this for once (as I said) to shew what an Adversary I have to do with, and to give the Reader a Taste of the way of his Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting. I have pretermitted, and will pass over some hundreds of this kind.</p>
               <p>In the Explication of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> I observed, that by <hi>Prophecy</hi> might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Prophets,</hi> the Abstract for the Concrete, as Presbytery is put for Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: that, if <hi>Timothy</hi> was Ordained but once, then must he have been Ordained by <hi>Paul</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6.), who also was specially determined thereto by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30465:11"/>
and so acted therein as an <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> that is, Ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> by Prophecy, the Presbyters joining with him: that if there were more Prophets than one concerned in this Ordination, <hi>Silas</hi> might have been another, who is stiled a Prophet, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 32. he having been <hi>Paul'</hi>s Companion before, <hi>Timothy v.</hi> 40. and after also <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. 25, 17, 15, 18, 5. Lastly, that if nothing of this will be allowed, then it must be said, that the Presbyters by Special Revelation, and Prophecy appointed thereunto, Ordained <hi>Timothy.</hi> And I give <hi>Mr. O.</hi> his choice of any of these Expositions: If he accepts the last (as most likely he will) it is however no precedent or warrant for Ordinary Presbyters, by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Ordinary Power and Office, to Impose hands and Conferr Orders. <hi>Mr. O.</hi> in reply to this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> not offer'd one Syllable: but he has interposed some (as he thinks) witty descants upon the Rector's words and notions, merely to evade the Argument, and to perplex it; which I account not worth my particular Notice.</p>
               <p>But whereas he thus Paraphrases on my Words, <hi>Neglect not the Gift that is in thee, which was given by Prophets, with the laying on of the Hands of Prophets,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating it to be Nonsense, observe me once more, and Remember that the Rector proposed two ways of Interpreting this Passage in <hi>Timothy. First,</hi> That by <hi>Prophecy</hi> may be meant Prophets in the <hi>Concrete,</hi> distinct from the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> spoken of in the same Period; and then the sense must be, <hi>Neglect not the Gift which was given thee by Prophets,</hi> (directed and determined unto that Action, by some Extraordinary and Express Command of God) <hi>with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbyters,</hi> as assistants in the Solemnity. Either this is sense, or I have none, and being admitted, confirms my Point, <hi>That Ordinary meer Presbyters Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained not</hi> Timothy <hi>by their ownsole Power. Secondly,</hi> Or else the Passage may thus be understood, That <hi>Prophecy</hi> is to be taken in the Abstract, as it lies in the Text, and the Presbyters were the Persons, unto whom the Prophecy came, appointing them to Ordain <hi>Timothy,</hi> who therefore were Prophets, and not Ordinary Presbyters in that particular Action. On this supposition the Words must run, <hi>Neglect not the Gift, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbyters,</hi> unto whom the Prophecy came. And this ought to pass with <hi>Mr. O.</hi> for sense, if he is Master of any, and shews, that meer Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Presbyters, did not Ordain <hi>Timothy,</hi> by Virtue of their Ordinary Power, but by Special Commission from God. But <hi>Mr. O.</hi> confounds these two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Interpretations, putting them together (which ought to be considered sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately) contrary to all Laws of Disputation, and then pretends to have found out some Absurdity, or Nonsense in the Rector's Gloss. Moreover, the Gloss is not absurd, even as <hi>Mr. O.</hi> has laid it. For supposing that by <hi>Prophecy</hi> is meant <hi>Prophets,</hi> and that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were those <hi>Prophets,</hi> 'tis proper enough to say, <hi>That</hi> Timothy <hi>was ordained by Prophets, with the laying on of the Hands of the Prophets,</hi> the former Clause donoting who ordained him, the latter by what Ceremony or Solemnity, it was performed.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a degrading <hi>Paul,</hi> when we make him a Prophet, which is an order inferior to Apostle, as <hi>Mr. O.</hi> weakly enough argues. Its<note place="margin">

                  </hi> was inferior to <hi>Paul,</hi> and (as I may say) a Subaltern Apostle? then the Objection is gone. And what if several Persons in equal Power, mav make up (not Heads, but) one <hi>Political</hi> Head in a Society? Then the Wonder is over. In <hi>Dioclesian's</hi> Days, there were several Emperours <hi>Socii Imperii.</hi> There were lately two Czars in <hi>Moscovy,</hi> and two Princes in <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis indeed Monstrous, when a <hi>Natural</hi> Body has two or more Heads: But that a <hi>Political</hi> Body or Society, should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by two or more Persons jointly in a Parity, nothing is more Ordinary: <hi>Casar</hi> indeed was of another Mind, and his Maxim was, <hi>Imperium non capit duos:</hi> but 'twas his Pride and Ambition, which Prompted him to say so. For matter of Fact, and his Successors Practice, has abundantly confuted him. But if <hi>Mr. O.</hi> will not allow two or more Governours of a Body Politick, to be called the <hi>Head</hi> of that Society, then are the Presbyterian Churches, and the Independent Congregations, so many Bodies without an Head. And I think, a Body without any Head, is altogether as Monstrous, as a Body with two or more.</p>

                  <hi>Mr. O.</hi> adds, <q>The Presbyters at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had many <hi>Apostles</hi>

                  <q>If the Apostle joined the Presbytery with him, in the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> it proves that Presbyters have an Inherent Power of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> True, it may safely be granted, in Conjunction with the Apostle, and with Bishops, but not without them. The House of Commons has an inherent Power to make a Vote of Parliament, but not without the Lords; and both Houses have an inherent Power to make a Law, but not without the King.

                  <hi>Presbytery,</hi> Act. 15. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is not appositely observed: for it was a Council not a Presbytery, though the Presbyters of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were in it: haply other Presbyters also, besides an Apostle (or Apostles) though he be the Head (or Governour) of a Presbytery, may be aptly distinguished from that Presbytery, whereof he is Head: and yet at the same time he is a Member of that Presbytery. Jesus Christ is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>the Head of the Body,</hi> (the Church) <hi>Eph.</hi> 22. 23. <hi>c</hi> 4, 15, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. and so is distinguished from the Body, though we cannot properly call any thing a Body, except we comprehend the Head also: for a body is not a Body without the Head; and the Head is a Member of the Body. And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> distinguishes between the Body, that is the Church, and Christ the Head of it; when at the same time, Christ the Head, must be believed a Member of his own Body. I expect then <hi>Mr. O.</hi> will in good time rally npon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and expose his Expression, as he has mine.</p>
               <p>Moreover though the Apostles are distinguished from the Elders, yet it follows not that they are distinguished from the Council (or Presbytery) when the Members of a Body are distinguished from one another, they are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as distinguished from the Body, but from one another only. St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the Natural body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. tells us, that though the Members of that Body are many, yet'tis but one Body: and he distinguishes also the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from one another, as the Hands from the Feet, and both from the Eyes, and all these from the Ears, and the Hand from the rest of the Body, but yet he affirms, they are all of the Body, and together make up the Body. So St. <hi>Luke</hi> reckons the two Principal and Constituent Parts of the Council at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> and distinguishes between the Apostles and the Elders, between the Head and the lower Members, but not between the Head and the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Apostles and Council: for no one can think but the Apostles were a part of the Council, or, if you please, call it a Presbytery.</p>
               <p>I beg the Readers patience, when I say, a Body is not a Body without an Head. Our late Presbyteries were such Bodies without visible Heads. The Classical Body moved to the place of meeting, I say moved without an Head. A frightful Spectacle! When it had sat a few moments without an Head, it then made it self an Head, a President or Moderator, <hi>protempore,</hi> who was before but an inferior Member, but now mounted up for an hour or two, to be the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30465:12"/>
Head. But it may be ask'd who was the Head, when this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was set up? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Body acted without an Head. However the Business of the day being over, the Artificial Head drops off from the Shoulders, and thence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is an Hand or a Foot, as before. So every Member of the Body in its turn, becomes the Head; and the Head dwindling again into a small Member. The Body then continues for some Days or Weeks without an Head. And would it not scare one to see a Body once more without an Head? Hereby <hi>Mr. O.</hi> may see, 'tis possible to ridicule the Presbyteries, if one will take the Liberty to confine Words to their Natural Signification, when they are used Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Rector undertakes to reconcile <hi>this Contradiction,</hi> and to expose Mr. <hi>O.</hi> as a meer Trifler.

                     </gap> that Way. However, I'll comply with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> for once, and let <hi>James</hi> pass for one of the Twelve Apostles: but then I must accquaint him, that one of the Twelve Apostles, was the fixt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Prefect or Ruler, that is, Bishop of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> We read of him being at <hi>Jerusalem, Act.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 19. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9, 12. <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 18.

                     </gap>, as himself also believes.

                     </gap>, or to writ it <hi>Sanedrin,</hi> not <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> with the Aspirat. And to speak the very Truth in writing that Word, my thoughts were ever upon the Greek Noun <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But when all is said concerning this Word <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> I must acknowledge, I have some scruple, and suspition about it.

I will briefly run through his Arguments, and as I go along, make my Answer to every one of 'em singly.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Apostle did not appoint one Presbyter Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,<note place="margin">P. 99, 100.</note> to preside over the rest: For <hi>Timothy</hi> (and <hi>Titus</hi>) were not Ordinary Presbyters, but extraordinary Officers, that is, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists: There is no hint in the Epistles to <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> that they were Ordained to be the Apostles Successors, in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall consider in the following Fifth Chapter, this pretence of their being extraordinary Officers, and Evangelists, whereby Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would evade our Argument, for <hi>Timothy'</hi>s being made the Prefect or Ruler, of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in the Apostles stead, mean while, granting there is no hint in the Epistle to <hi>Tim.</hi> that he was Ordained to be the Apostle's Successor in <hi>Ephesus</hi> (though the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epistle 1. 6. is a shrewd Intimation of it, according to <hi>Jerom</hi>) yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not hence, that he was not the Apostle's Successor. The Reverend Dr. <hi>Stratford</hi> was not Ordained Presbyter, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Apostle did, and it was the proper Season, and his Duty, at his taking final leave, to settle the Government of that Church: But he then committed it to the Presbytery, in a Parity, and not to any single Person, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. For any thing to be found in that, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. St. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> might have before this time, appointed a single Person, over the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders, and so have left it. These words — <hi>Take heed therefore unto your selves, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost has made you Overseers, to feed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of God,</hi> might, and may properly enough at this day, be spoken unto Presbyters, subject to a President (or Bishop) set over them. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Supreme Power was here committed to the Elders, however, its not proved, nor can be, that it was in a Parity: the words might have been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to 'em, <hi>divisim,</hi> severally, which divests one part of the Dissenters, of their Presbyteries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. However it was, suppose the Government lodged in the Presbytery, St. <hi>Paul</hi> might afterwards, by Divine Authority, intrust it with a single Person. As to the matter of fact, whether he did so, is the present controversy; the Issue whereof will depend on what follows.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We may with better reason affirm, that <hi>Timothy'</hi>s<note place="margin">

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:30465:15"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Not so. If <hi>Timothy'</hi>s Supreme Power followed that of the Elders, (as shall be proved) and if it cannot be proved, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Government committed to <hi>Timothy</hi> was ever changed, afterwards by any subsequent Act of the Apostles, the Objection vanishes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> gives not the least hint, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. of any Ruler set; or to be set over them: That he must needs know what Government God would have set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What hint is there to be observed, in the 1st Epistle to <hi>lim.</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Presbyterian Parity? Or indeed of the Presbyters having the least share in the Church Government? It was as necessary he should mention the Presbytery in his first Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> (supposed by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> written before the farewel Sermon) as to make mention of their Prelatical Bishop, in his Farewel Sermon. Nor did the Apostle know beforehand, all the mind and Intentions of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Church. He knew not so much as what would befal himself, save, what other Prophets told him (<hi>v.</hi> 23.) and yet still he was left in the dark as to many things (<hi>v.</hi> 22.). I see no reason for believing, <hi>Paul</hi> must needs know at that time, God's Intention of altering the Church Government afterwards. If so, 'tis not to be wondred, he did not acquaint the Presbyters with it. Besides, there's good reason to think, that <hi>Paul,</hi> though he knew it, would not acquaint 'em with it, at that time. Happy he saw they would not then brook, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear of the alteration, and of being subject to any other single Person, except the Apostle himself: especially when no Occasion was, as yet, given for it. But in process of time, after some of <hi>themselves were risen,</hi> and had spoke <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse things,</hi> and turning Schismaticks, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> drawn away Disciples after them.</hi> v. 30. then was the time for changing the Government, and charging <hi>Timothy</hi> to silence those that taught false Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. and then it was, that at least the Humble, and Peaceable, and Obedient, and Holy Presbyters, would readily submit to the Change.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>Asks, whether there were no Prophecy of <hi>Timothy'</hi>s<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 103.</note> being the suture (Bishop) Ruler of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> If there was, why did <hi>Paul</hi> suppress it, in <hi>Act.</hi> 20.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I have given a reason of this already: But further note, that there was such a Prophecy, as I believe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18. though it might not have been. given, till after <hi>Paul'</hi>s farewel Sermon. I add, it is very probable also, that he was Ordained unto it, 2. <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. 6. So St. <hi>Jerom</hi> thought, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to overthrow the common reason given of the change of Church Government, asserts, <q>That the establishment of the Presbytery at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was for <hi>a remedy against Schism,</hi> therefore the Elders were admonished, to Oversee the Flock, <hi>v.</hi> 28.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Minister here, is not at all fair in his reasoning; for the Remedy, which the Apostles prescribes against the <hi>Wolves,</hi> or <hi>Interlopers,</hi> that would thrust themselves in among 'em, and against the <hi>Vipers,</hi> which would arise, out of their own Bowels, was, <hi>to take heed to themselves, and to the Flock, to feed the Church of God,</hi> the other words, <hi>over which the Holy Ghost has made you Overseers,</hi> being only a reminding them, by the way, of their Power and Duty. All Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of what kind soever it be, 'tis confest, is in general a Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Schism: But these Elders, are not said, to have been Ordained Overseers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30465:15"/>
by the Apostle, as if that particular Government of Presbyterian Parity, was especially intended for a Remedy against future Schism. The proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Remedy here prescribed, by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is, <hi>To take heed,</hi> &amp;c. and as it follows <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>To watch,</hi> &amp;c. without which 'twas impossible to provide Effectually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a surprize from their Enemies, the <hi>Wolves,</hi> and the <hi>Vipers,</hi> there spoken of. Being <hi>Overseers,</hi> or Governours of the Church, would not do the Work, (whether they acted in a Parity or in Subordination to some single Person, was the same thing as to the Apostles Argument here, and whether it were the one or the other still) it was their <hi>taking heed and watching,</hi> must secure 'em against Schisms and against Heresies. But if afterward this Presbyterian Parity, was by experience found inconvenient, rather a Nursery, and Occasion of Schism, and therefore for that very reason, altered into Prelatical form of Government, for the security of the Church in Peace and Order, as <hi>Jerom</hi> owns, it is most proper, to say, that Prelacy was introduced into the Church, as a designed Remedy against Schism, and not Presbyterian Parity, which was indeed the Occasion of it, at least, was not sufficient to prevent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> further argues, that God did not, could not change<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 103.</note> the first instituted Church Government, because, he foresees all events, and knows how to prevent Schisms, by apt and effectual Remedies, and with him is no <hi>variableness nor shadow of turning.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Such general Harangues (though grounded on true Principles, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood, and explained) prove nothing. For on the other side, we know that God oftimes Repents, and takes new measures for the accomplishing his own great and good designs. God imployed <hi>Noah,</hi> a Preacher of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to perswade the then wicked World to Repentance and Reformation; when this succeeded not, it repented him that he had made Man, and so he drowned all the World, except eight Persons. God, who himself in a Peculiar manner, governed <hi>Israel;</hi> appointing what Prophets and Rulers should succeed at a vacancy (the Government of <hi>Israel,</hi> is hence called a <hi>Theocracy</hi>) yielded to the importunity of the People, and gave them a King, <hi>Saul</hi> to govern them, after the manner of the Nations. But presently after, it repented God that he had set up <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, because he turned back from following God. 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 15. 11. Where then is the absurdity in saying, God upon the Occasion of Schisms, directed the Apostles to alter the Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Christians? Or rather (as Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De serie &amp; Succes.</hi> p. 73.</note> speaks) to perfect and compleat it. For the Apostles, so long as it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good unto 'em, retained in their own hands the Government of all the Churches by them founded, as appears from, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 21, 22, 23. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 36. but when the time of their departure drew on, or when busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness encreasing on their hand, by reason of their many conversions, they were forced, to be absent, or distant from those Churches a long time, they substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in their Rooms, Successors and single Persons to preside over the Churches: Which indeed in exact speaking was not a Change, but a continuance rather of the former Government, all the difference being, that whereas the Apostles were Governours of many Churches, these their Successors were Rules but of one haply, of which difference I speak afterwards.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> He abuses the Text: 'tis Ministring <hi>for</hi> not <hi>to</hi> the Heirs of Salvation. They Minister <hi>to</hi> God <hi>for</hi> us. So the King is the Minister of (or to God) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. for us: Nevertheless he is our Superior, even as the Angels are. Briefly by this Argument neither Jesus Christ, nor the Apostles, nor Bishops, nor Presbyters, nor Dissenting Ministers, have any Authority: for all these Minister for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or pretend it.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has not produced one example hereof. If any one is at leisure, to examine the Text cited by him, he'll find this true: For of <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. I treat by and by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <q>That the Epistles were directed to all the believers of the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches (so I understand him) and not to the Angels only.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Not so: But to the Angles only for the use of the Believers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>That 'tis uncertain whether there is an Hierarchy among the Angels, that the <hi>Pseudo-Dionysius</hi> makes them the lowest Order: that therefore they cannot represent the highest Order in the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis meer jangling to alledge the Opinion, of an Author confessedly spurious. But 'tis manifest that there is an Angelical Hierarchy from<note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 10. 13. ch. 12 1. 1 Thes. 4. 16.</note> Scripture, and that Angels are the Superior Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be gathered from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 38. where they reckoned<note place="margin">Judge. 9.

Lastly, the Superlative Excellency of Angels, supposing them the lowest Order makes them a fit Representation of the Highest degree among Men.

               <p n="5">5. <q>That the Holy Ghost in the Epistles alludes to the Minister, of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, in Conformity to the Language of the Old Testament, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 23. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 1, 7. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 1.</q>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:30465:17"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In these Texts there is no mention of Synagogues, nor any where else in the Old Testament. Nor do we meet with <hi>Angels</hi> of the Synagogue, but <hi>Ruler</hi> in the New: nor any where else but in the late Rabbins. <hi>Job'</hi>s <hi>Messenger</hi> was either a real Angel, or extraordinary Prophet, <hi>Interpreter</hi> and <hi>one of a Thousand,</hi> v. 23. <hi>Hagga</hi> was a Prophet, so was the Baptist, not <hi>Ministers</hi> of Synagogues. When Mr. <hi>O.</hi> appeals unto <hi>Malachy,</hi> he is gone from the Synagogue, to the Temple, and so quitted his Argument. Nor doth <hi>Priests, Mal.</hi> 2. 1. signify all, even the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Priests in the Temple, but the High Priests only in Succession, who are therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 7. exprest in the singular and indefinitely, or if Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will have it so, <hi>Priests</hi> here signfies <hi>Collectively,</hi> all High Priests. For it must be confest, when the <hi>Subject</hi> of a Proposition is put indefinitely, in the singular number, and the <hi>Predicate</hi> belongs to the whole <hi>Species,</hi> then the <hi>Subject</hi> may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Collectively, and is equivalent to an <hi>Vniversal</hi> Proposition, as when we say, <hi>Man is a rational Creature,</hi> we mean <hi>all Men</hi> are so. But it will be said that the <hi>Predicate,</hi> viz. <hi>his Lips should keep knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. appertains to the whole <hi>Species</hi> of Priests, even the <hi>Secondary.</hi> I reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Supposing this, yet still there was an High Priest in the Temple: And therefore agreeably hereunto, though all the Elders were called Angels (admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this) yet there was an Arch-Angel in every Church, unto whom the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles were directed, who was, <hi>The Angel</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For 2 <hi>Angel</hi> in the Epistles, is not described by a <hi>Specifical,</hi> but an <hi>individual</hi> Character, <hi>ex. gr. the Angel of the Church of Ephesus.</hi> If it be said this is a <hi>Specifical</hi> Character, because all the Elders were Angels of that Church, I return that cannot be. For no body ever directed a Letter, thus indefinitely to all, and to every one, or any one of the same Denomination. The Title may haply belong to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Persons, for different Reasons, and yet the Letter is intended for some one more Eminently called so. As if a Letter were directed, <hi>To the Speaker of the House of Commons,</hi> though every Member is Speaker, if he pleases, and though of the Topping and forward Commoners, we usually say, <hi>They are Speakers,</hi> because they often Speak to matters in Debate, yet every Foot-Boy will apprehend the Letter is sent, to a particular determinate Person commonly called, <hi>The Speaker.</hi> Wherefore if all the Elders of <hi>Ephesus</hi> were in some sense Angels, yet <hi>The Angel</hi> must mean some single Person, known in Special manner stiled <hi>Angel,</hi> who could be no other than the Prelatical Ruler of that Church.</p>
               <p>A great deal is argued in defense of the Hebrew Reading of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that of the Seventy. But besides what has been elsewhere offered in the Vindication of the latter, I here add, That <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
                  <note place="margin">*** Ep. ad Corinth. cont. <hi>Celsum.</hi> l. 5. p. 250. <hi>Edit. Cant. Comment. in Dan.</hi> c. 7. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Romanus</hi> *, that <hi>Origen</hi> *, and <hi>Jerom</hi> *, himself the fierce Stickler for the Hebrew, reads the place according to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty. It may then with Reason be suspected, that the proud conceited Jews, corrupted this Scripture, to magnify themselves and their Nation, as if God in dividing the Nations, had his Eye 'specially on the Sons of <hi>Israel,</hi> modelling the World accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of them, that went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins imagine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:30465:17"/>As for the precise number of Provinces, and their Guardian Angels, though the Rabbins, and the Hebrew Reading of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8. seem to determine them by the number of <hi>Jacob'</hi>s Children, who went with him into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet neither the Seventy, nor I have adventured so punctually to define it, but have left that point uncertain and indefinite. It is not known into how many Provinces God cast the World at first, nor can we tell into how many more he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards multiply, or into how few reduce it: For even the <hi>Romans</hi> were wont sometimes to increase, and sometimes to diminish their Provinces. As therefore God might (for any thing we know) in the beginning, have divided the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into Seventy times seven Provinces, and constituted so many Guardian Angels over them, and afterward altered the number of both, by adding or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing, as he saw good: So might he have appointed, and varied the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Bishops, as the Condition of the Church requir'd, into sometimes more, and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>I will conclude the whole Argument, with two or three Observations, which will confirm what is before pleaded; That there is an Hierarchy among the Celestial Spirits, and Angels (as I said according to the current Opinion in former times) presiding as Guardians over Kingdoms and Provinces, is Witnessed by<note n="*" place="margin">Comment. in Zach. 1. 8.</note>

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> whereas I argu'd, that the Synagogue-Rulers were subject to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> High Priests, <hi>Ch</hi> (says he) <hi>so are Presbyters to Jesus Christ our High Priest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But we are inquiring about subjection unto visible Rulers, and if Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will needs have the Synagogue a Pattern of the Christian Congregations, then the Presbyters must be subject unto some visible Superiour, (as were the Rulers of the Synagogues) which he is obliged to Name. Till then my Observation is of Moment, but his Reply meerly Delusory, and Evasive.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>Let the Bishops produce as clear a Charter for their Order, as the High-Priests did for theirs, and we'll submit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. First,</hi> It is sufficient, I suppose, that the Bishops Charter is a clear one, as to the Power they Claim and exercise, tho' not as to the Title of Bishop. It makes no great matter what becomes of that. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let Mr. <hi>O.</hi> bring as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30465:18"/>
clear a Proof of Presbyterian Parity, or Independency, or of Presbyters exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Supreme Acts of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, as are to be produced from the Epistles to <hi>Tim.</hi> and <hi>Tit.</hi> in behalf of Prelacy, that is, for a single Persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding over Churches and governing them, and there's an end of the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ask Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. between him and me, whether he does not submit to some Religious usages, for which there is not so clear a Charter in the New Testament, as there is in the Old, for some of the Jewish Rites. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has as clear and express Commandments for Infant Baptism, for the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and Divine Institution of the Lord's-Day, for days of Publick and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Fasts or Humiliation, for Singing <hi>David'</hi>s <hi>Psalms,</hi> in <hi>Metre,</hi> as the Jews had for Circumcision, for <hi>Saturday-Sabbath,</hi> for their Fasting-Days, and for their Singing the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> in their way? It is not then for want of a clear Charter (as I fear) that he refuses to submit to Bishops, but for want of a clear Understanding, and a peaceable and humble mind. He that can sit down with reasonable Deductions, and be prevailed with, to make no scruple of doing what is thereby recommended unto him, if he were steady to his own Principle, ought to be satisfyed with the like Reasonable Conclusions, in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>I said in the <hi>T. N.</hi> that a great deal of the Temple-Worship, being Moral Religion, it was as much the Pattern of the Christian, as the Synagogue Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was. And on that account, the Jewish Priesthood might be the Pattern of the Christian Hierarchy.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> says no, because <hi>the Jewish Priesthood was appropriated to the Ceremonial worship of the Temple, though they performed the moral parts there also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Though the Jewish Priesthood, and the Temple worship, were incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with Ceremonies, yet they might be the Pattern of the Christian Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Worship. An embroidered Garment may be the Pattern of a plain one; They may both be like in shape, and in substance, though not in Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their Trimming. Besides, though the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, yet some others were substituted by Jesus Christ, in their room, as Baptism, and the Lord's-Supper. But how could the Synagogue (which had no Ceremony at all, only the Moral parts of Religion performed in it) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s reasoning, be a pattern of the Christian Churches, which have Ceremonies? There is as much disagreement between a Synagogue, which has no Ceremonies, only Natural Religion exercised in it, and a Christian Church which has Ceremonies, besides the natural Religion, as there is between the Temple which had <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies, and the Christian which has not.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> argues, <hi>that the Legal Priests, and Altar, and Priesthood were changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> True, as to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies: But not as to any thing which was Moral: And Government, I conceive, is a part of Moral Religion: though therefore a <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonial High-Priest was not ordained for the Christian Church, yet in Imitation of the Jewish Ecclesiastical Government, a Christian High Priest, might be appointed, the Ceremonies of the Law being laid aside.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>The Moral Worship in the Synagogues might be performed by such as were no Priests.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> And will Mr. <hi>O.</hi> therefore assert, that any Man may in a Christian Publick Congregation, perform the Moral parts of Worship? This very Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s, shews that the Synagogues were not the Pattern of Christian
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30465:18"/>
Churches or Congregations; because I take it for granted, that none among us can perform, even Moral Worship, in Publick, except Deacons, Presbyters, and Bishops. It rather, therefore, imports that the Temple Worship is the Pattern of the Christian: Because, as none but the Priests and <hi>Levites,</hi> could perform the Moral Worship in the Temple (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 27. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 17.) Even so among us, none can, except Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> Titus <hi>was left in</hi> Crete, <hi>but for a Season, perhaps not above half a Year,</hi> Paul <hi>charging him to come to him unto</hi> Nicopolis, <hi>&amp;c. Tit.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> According to my <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> it might be some Years after <hi>Paul'</hi>s leaving <hi>Crete,</hi> that he sent for him unto <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> The Apostle, as I suppose, left him at <hi>Crete,</hi> as he sailed from <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Judaea,</hi> after his release from his first Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment at <hi>Rome:</hi> and long after, as he was returning to <hi>Italy,</hi> he sent for him to <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> If this be once proved (as I promise) then <hi>Titus</hi> was not left in <hi>Crete</hi> for a Season. But according to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> I cannot imagine that <hi>Titus</hi> could have been left in <hi>Crete</hi> half a Month, far enough short of half a Year, and too short a time to <hi>set in Order the</hi>

However it cannot (I own) be denied, that <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Titus</hi> from <hi>Crete,</hi> and, by consequence, it will be said, he was not the fixt Ruler (or Bishop) there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The resident Governors of Churches, in the Apostles days, were not so tyed to their Posts, that they might not, on any account whatever, stir thence. It is not to be doubted, but that they removed for a while, at the Apostle's call, and for the furtherance of the Gospel, unto other places, and afterwards returned to their Residence again. I do suppose, <hi>Titus</hi> went to St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> and thence with him unto <hi>Rome:</hi> That as he returned back unto <hi>Crete,</hi> by the Apostle's direction, he took <hi>Dalmatia</hi> in his way<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> to plant the Gospel there, or to confirm the Churches: What became of him afterward, cannot be known from Scripture, the Divine History of the Church of <hi>Crete</hi> reaching no further.

Why not? So God first without the suffrage of the People, chose the Twelve Apostles (<hi>Act.</hi> 10. 41.) where the same word is used, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and then Ordained 'em, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. by anointing 'em with the Spirit. Nor is Mr. <hi>O.</hi> mistaken, when he imagines me <hi>Dreaming,</hi> that after Ordination, <hi>Titus</hi> assigned those Elders some new Powers, which I think is intimated in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which does not properly signify to Ordain, but pre-supposes Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and imports the placing of those Elders in their particular Stations. And this, I believe, is distinct from their Ordination.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I do not apprehend this to be a degrading them. For whilst they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the Companions and Fellow Labourers of the Apostles, and unfixt Officers of the Church, they cannot properly be said to have <hi>had a general power over all Churches,</hi> but were continually at the beck and Command of the Apostles, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch such Orders, as were from time to time given them. As they had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place of Residence, so neither had they any certain work, but were like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formades in an Army, who have nothing to do, but what the General by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Order employs 'em in upon sudden Occasions. If it be allowable, <hi>magnis componere parva,</hi> to explain the Condition of the unfixt Evangelists, by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance well known in this County Palatine of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> they were like to our <hi>Itinerant</hi> Preachers, founded by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of Famous Memory. These have a Power from the Bishop of the Diocess, to Preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any Church, or Chappel within the said County, as his Lordship shall direct them, or they know is necessary and convenient to the Service of the Reformation. They have a general Power to Preach in the Churches in <hi>Lancashire.</hi> Now if the Bishop fixes them in some Rectory or Vicarage, no Man will say they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded, though the Exercise of their Ministery is brought into a narrower Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass

               <p>THE Question here is, whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave <hi>Timothy</hi> those ample Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions and Instructions, that we read of in his first Epistle, concerning the Government of the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Church, some time after he had <hi>besought him to abide still at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>when he went into</hi> Macedonia, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 1. 3.

the Eastern Parts again, visiting the Churches; and then as he passed out of <hi>Asia,</hi> into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> besought <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as the fixt Ruler, or Bishop of that Church; And shortly, after dispatched the 1st Epistle to him. That <hi>Paul</hi> himself, some while after, went back into <hi>Italy,</hi> and unto the utmost parts of the West, Preaching the Gospel, and being at length once more got unto <hi>Rome,</hi> was there Imprisoned a second time, when he wrote the second Epistle to <hi>Tim.</hi> a little before he was Beheaded.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a great difference between <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 14, 15. The former implies a continued stay at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the latter only signifies <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timothy'</hi>s halting, that is, tarrying behind <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Beraea.</hi> Besides, we have no account of <hi>Timothy'</hi>s sudden remove from <hi>Ephesus:</hi> But we have of <hi>Timothy'</hi>s leaving <hi>Beraea</hi> soon after, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 5. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 2. Lastly, the Orders given unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> were many and Important, which also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired time to be executed, which does not appear to have been the Case of <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Beraea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Timothy'</hi>s stay there (at <hi>Ephesus</hi>) was but short, that is, until the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle came to him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 13.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no Colour of Argument in this. It is not said, he must tarry no longer there, than till <hi>Paul</hi> came to him; Nor can that be the meaning; For then it would follow, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was to <hi>give attendance to Reading, to Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to Doctrine,</hi> but till the Apostle came to him: Which (I hope) Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will not affirm. Besides, <hi>Paul</hi> was not certain of his going to <hi>Ephesus shortly;</hi> Therefore he adds, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15 — <hi>If I tarry long,</hi> &amp;c. from which Passages I gather, That <hi>Paul,</hi> at his first beseeching of <hi>Timothy,</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> thought his Instructions not full enough, and therefore intended to see <hi>Timothy, shortly</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and to furnish him with further Orders, how he ought to <hi>behave himself in the House of God,</hi> the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> committed to him: But because he suspected he might <hi>tarry long,</hi> he therefore in the mean while sent him this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle: All which shews, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was designed for the fixt Ruler of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Although the Apostle resolved to visit him there <hi>shortly:</hi> Not to remove him thence, but to give him fuller Directions about the management of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>He was not fixt as Resident at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> because, the Apostle after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward called him to <hi>Rome,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 9. 21.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I will take an Opportunity by and by, to Discourse about Residence, where the weakness of this Objection will fully appear. In the Interim I'll only acquaint the Reader, that according to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s own <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> it could not be less than between three and four Years, after the writing of the first Epistle, that <hi>Paul</hi> sent for <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and according unto mine, about six Years. which is a considerable stay, or Residence in one Place. I say, further that <hi>Paul'</hi>s sending for <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> is no Argument that <hi>Timothy</hi> for ever quitted that Post: That he returned back to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> must be made appear from Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiastical History, the Scripture going no further, in the Account of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi>

                     </gap>,</hi> after his Release from his first Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, after the History of the Acts of the Apostles, wherein no mention is made of this Voyage, as I assert; against this (I say) Mr. <hi>O.</hi> Objects, <hi>That nothing can be concluded from</hi> Luke's <hi>silence in this Point: For 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he doth not mention all the Journies of</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Timothy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I readily grant that bare silence is no good Proof, without some other considerations to support it; and I also grant, that <hi>Luke</hi> mentions not all <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy'</hi>s Journeys: But I contend that he Omits none of <hi>Paul'</hi>s from the 13<hi>th</hi> Chapter unto the end of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, as any impartial Man will believe, if he carefully reads that part of the History. And for proof of this, I shall at present content my self with the acknowledgement and. Testimony of <hi>Beza</hi> himself, who thus writes particularly as to <hi>Paul'</hi>s Journeys into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia — Ter omnino vidit</hi> Macedoniam Paulus, <hi>ut ex historiae filo apparet.

                  <hi>constitui.</hi> Paul <hi>saw</hi> Macedonia, <hi>but thrice, as is manifest from the History, as 'tis closely laid together by</hi> Luke. <hi>For though he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not all things, and every little movement of the Apostle, yet his History appears so contrived, that more Journies of his into</hi> Macedonia <hi>cannot be assigned or allow'd.</hi> I do not indeed believe that St. <hi>Luke</hi> has set down within the time mention'd, every <hi>Step</hi> the Apostle made by the by, unto Towns, and Villages near at hand. While <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 'tis to me out of Controversy, that he went into the Neighouring places, Preaching the Gospel, though <hi>Luke</hi> has not told us so. There were Christians, and a Church at <hi>Cenchrea, Rom.</hi> 16. 1. where doubtless the Apostle had taught the Word of God: but <hi>Luke</hi> omitted this. Nevertheless, 'tis senseless to think, the Historian should forget so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Voyage, as this of <hi>Paul'</hi>s going from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> unto <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and leaving <hi>Timothy</hi> behind him. But that which I further add, is, That I do not rely barely on St. <hi>Luke'</hi>s silence, but observe, that in his History, he has left no room for St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s placing <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> at any of those three times, when he went into <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And if this be well prov'd, as has been, and shall be once more, then another Journey of <hi>Paul'</hi>s into <hi>Macedonia</hi> must be searched for, and I do believe may be, and has been found out. In order to make out all this, let us first examine the Ministers <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is this, <q>That St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> sent<note place="margin">

'Tis then most probable that <hi>Timothy</hi> was to meet <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and that the Apostle expected him there, and there we find 'em together at the writing of the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>

Thus it was at <hi>Paul'</hi>s departure, and thus it continued some time after: Even when the Apostle the next year called together the Elders at <hi>Miletus,</hi> all was still well among 'em.

(As we read in the first Epistle to <hi>Tim.</hi>) there was much Business, and more than he could dispatch, in that little time allowed for his stay there by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> There is the more force in this Argument, because the Apostle at his Writing the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> soon after from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> hopes to be with him at <hi>Ephesus shortly,</hi> (1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. 14.) Was <hi>Timothy</hi> left at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in the Apostle's room to discharge so many important Matters, as are reckoned up in that Epistle, and yet the Apostle intend to return unto <hi>Ephesus shortly;</hi> and serve him with a Writ of Ease?

He did not then write his 1st.

The Case between them stood thus. <hi>Paul</hi> desired <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> hoping doubtless and designing to be back with him in a little time.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Before I come to the main Business, I must take notice of several mistakes and Inconsistences in this Account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Paul</hi> cannot be said to have <hi>returned</hi> from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet in this Peregrination he had not been. For <hi>Paul</hi> first came from <hi>Ephesus</hi> into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> then went into <hi>Greece, Acts</hi> 20. 2. He returned indeed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Macedonia</hi> again, <hi>v.</hi> 3. but he did not <hi>return</hi> out of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> into <hi>Greece.</hi> But the meaning is, I presume, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> must be, as far as I am able to comprehend him, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>when</hi> (or as) <hi>he went from</hi> Macedonia <hi>into</hi> Greece <hi>left</hi> Titus <hi>in</hi> Crete, Tit. 1. 5. which is absurd, as any one will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that knows the Geographical Situation of these Places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> thinks that <hi>Paul</hi> intended to Winter at <hi>Nicopolis:</hi> but 'tis evident, he intended to Winter at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 6. and 'tis as evident, that he did Winter there, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 3. for he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:30465:23"/>3. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> says, <hi>Paul returned through</hi> Macedonia, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>about the time as he writ the Epistle to</hi> Titus, <hi>in which He calls him to</hi> Nicopolis. But <hi>Paul'</hi>s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn through <hi>Macedonia,</hi> was in the Spring, and He was got to <hi>Philippi</hi> by <hi>Easter, Act.</hi> 20. 6. How then could he about this time write to <hi>Titus,</hi> and in his Letter call <hi>Titus</hi> to him at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> where he was determined to Winter, and yet Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was already past.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nicopolis (says Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) <hi>a City of</hi> Epirus <hi>not far distant from</hi> Corinth. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about 170. Miles: that's nothing with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> But I have shewn that 'tis unlikely <hi>Paul</hi> should at this time determine to Winter at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> where He had never as yet been, and where there was no Christian Church, that we known of: and 'tis yet more unlikely that the Apostle's hast, whereof we have spoken, should permit him to go so far directly another way from <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, says the Minister, <hi>Titus</hi> came to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> and was thence sent by the Apostle to <hi>Corinth</hi> to hasten the Collections. But the mischief is, <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by <hi>Titus</hi> from <hi>Macedonia</hi> before Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before the three Months mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 3. and then sent him to hasten the Collections. Whether Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has done Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> right in this confused Account I am not concerned to examine. He has made this his own Hypothesis, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I all along ascribe it to him.</p>
               <p>Well! letting these things pass, Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s meaning is (I guess) that <hi>Paul</hi> going from <hi>Macedonia</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> visited <hi>Crete in his way,</hi> and there left <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I do not yet understand how it can be properly said, that <hi>Paul</hi> as he went from <hi>Macedonia</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> visited <hi>Crete in his way. Greece</hi> is in the way from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Crete,</hi> how then did he visit <hi>Crete</hi> in the way as he went from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Greece?</hi> However, sometime hereabouts — (Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will say) between his leaving <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and settling in <hi>Greece, Paul</hi> visited <hi>Crete,</hi> and left <hi>Titus</hi> there, which is the thing I now undertake to disprove: but will first as my Foundation, tell the Story of <hi>Iitus,</hi> as exactly as I can gather it from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> dispatched <hi>Titus</hi> away to <hi>Corinth</hi> about the Collections, as I conceive, a Year or more before he sent <hi>Timothy</hi> unto <hi>Macedonia;</hi> as may be gathered, from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6, 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 2. where the Apostles testifies of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they were <hi>ready a Year ago.</hi> For this Reason it was that <hi>Paul</hi> looked and longed for <hi>Titus'</hi>s return, after above a Years absence. But <hi>Titus</hi> at last came to <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and gave him an Account what effect his first Epistle had upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 6, 7, &amp;c. as also of their will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingness to Contribute towards the Relief of the Poor Saints at <hi>Jerusalem, chap.</hi> 8, 10, 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 2. Hereupon <hi>Paul</hi> (and <hi>T mothy</hi>) writ the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians, Titus</hi> carrying it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6, 18. I must add, here another short account of <hi>Paul</hi> He left <hi>Ephesus</hi> soon after <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and arrived (let us imagine) in <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Philippi</hi> in <hi>Macedonia.</hi> There he <hi>gave much Exhortation,</hi> Acts 20. 2. which implies (as I gather) that he spent much time in <hi>Macedonia:</hi> let us suppose he tarry'd there, till about <hi>November.</hi> Then He set forward for <hi>Greece</hi> where he abode three Months, <hi>v.</hi> 3. that is till <hi>February,</hi> thence he returned early in the Spring into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and was got as far back as <hi>Philippi</hi> by <hi>Easter, v.</hi> 6 and so crost the Sea into <hi>Asia, Act.</hi> 20. This premised, my Arguments against Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Hypothesis are as follow.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:30465:24"/>1. Here is no time that can be assigned for <hi>Paul'</hi>s sailing unto <hi>Crete,</hi> and there Founding a Church. If it be thought, that during the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is allowed for his stay in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he might go to <hi>Crete,</hi> that cannot be granted: because <hi>Luke</hi> would doubtless have taken notice of so considerable an Enterprize: and besides, I do suppose, <hi>Paul</hi> was too busy in forwarding the Collections, <hi>and giving much Exhortation,</hi> to undertake such a long Voyage: Lastly, <hi>Luke</hi> plainly says, that <hi>Paul</hi> came from <hi>Macedonia</hi> (not from <hi>Crete</hi>) <hi>into Greece.</hi> If then within the time assigned to his stay in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he went to <hi>Crete,</hi> he must have returned back again, first into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and then have gone into <hi>Greece,</hi> which is absurd to suppose. Nor did he sail out of <hi>Grecce</hi> into <hi>Crete.</hi> For then <hi>Luke</hi> could not have writ, that he abode three Months, in <hi>Greece,</hi> one half of which time must at least have been spent in that Voyage to and again, and in tarrying there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor could <hi>Titus</hi> accompany the Apostle thither at this time. <hi>Titus</hi> was sent alone from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Corinth:</hi> His business at <hi>Corinth,</hi> was to encourage and promote the Contributions, as abundantly appears in the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If <hi>Titus</hi> went along with <hi>Paul</hi> unto <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with the Contributions (as cannot in reason be deny'd): how then could he be left in <hi>Crete</hi> to perfect that Church, and set in Order the things that were wanting? I Surely this required more than two or three Months. <hi>Paul</hi> was two whole Years at least in planting the Church of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> but <hi>Titus</hi> could finish that in <hi>Crete</hi> (it seems) in as few Months.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The great hast <hi>Paul</hi> was in, and the Multiplicity of business in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> that lay on his hands, and the Application wherewith he pursued it, will not suffer us to believe, that at this time he undertook such a great, and a new Work, that of the Conversion of the Island of <hi>Crete.</hi> At this time all other Concernments of the Church were laid aside, and gave place unto that of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the Collections, and carrying them to <hi>Judea.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Paul</hi> (as has been noted already) was in so great hast to go unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that he would not lose any time, no not tarry to Preach the Gospel at <hi>Troas, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> in that Farewel Sermon, I must retort, that neither did <hi>Paul</hi> mention the Elders, in the Commission given to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the first Epistle, which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> supposes written before that farewel Sermon.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I'll not create Mr. <hi>O.</hi> any unnecessary trouble: but grant that the same Person is mentioned in both places. But I must say, it does not appear that this <hi>Alexander</hi> was a Christian, at the uproar in <hi>Ephesus</hi> mentioned, <hi>Act</hi> 19. The contrary is most probable. He is called a <hi>Jew</hi> (not a Christian Believer) <hi>v.</hi> 34. If so, then he, who never yet Believed, could not yet be an Apostate and Consequently could not be Excommunicated. But say he were a Christian-Jew, it does not appear that he had any hand in raising the Tumult against <hi>Paul,</hi> or that he Apostatized from the Faith at that time. That his Excommunication was not long after his Apostacy I easily admit: but when he Apostatized, I do desire to be informed, as also where or to what Church he belonged, when he Apostatized, and was Excommunicated. The most likely was the <hi>Ephesian.</hi> Let

                  </gap>, and was Excommunicated? But, the Truth is, we are in the Dark both where and when he Apostatized, and by Consequence know not when <hi>Paul</hi> Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him. And therefore nothing can be drawn hence in proof of the time of the Apostles writing the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>

               <p>His Resolution of this Difficulty is out of Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> as follows — <q>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> designing to have Sailed for <hi>Syria,</hi> Acts 20. 3. came near to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and there discovering the Danger laid in his way by the Jews (which also might have involved <hi>Timothy</hi>) he brought him away back with him, and so both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and when Winter was over, they set Sail for <hi>Asia</hi> again.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I'll venture to call this a senseless Story, though Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has Fathered it upon the Learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> truly or falsly is no matter to me. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Timothy</hi> was not at <hi>Ephesus</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> was about to go for <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> He was with <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 4. Except Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will affirm, as indeed in the Account He gives of this Matter, he must suppose, that <hi>Timothy</hi> went back from <hi>Corinth,</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> thence following him to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> then returned to <hi>Ephesus</hi> again, and lastly, was thence fetched back by the Apostle unto <hi>Macedonia</hi> once more, and Wintered with him in <hi>Greece,</hi> and then returned with <hi>Paul</hi> through <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Miletus,</hi> all which has already been disproved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is here implyed by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> attempted to sail for <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> before Winter, which is inconsistent with <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 3. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 6.</p>

               <p n="5">5. 'Tis supposed that <hi>Paul</hi> designed to take Ship for <hi>Syria</hi> before Winter, or before it was over: which cannot be: because He Winter'd at <hi>Corinth, Act.</hi> 20. 3. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 6. or at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> mistakes.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="1">1. Because He had in <hi>Greece</hi> of late Zealously preach'd the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because He had now a considerable quantity of Money to carry thence to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Now if the Jews Plot was laid against <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> not

                  </hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> be involved in the danger, which threatened the Apostle in <hi>Greece?</hi> In short, there are so many wild and unaccountable Suppositions in this conceit, and so contrary to the plain and obvious meaning of the Text, that nothing but a stiff and resolute adherence to a Cause, could have brought it into the head of any Man, and engaged others to defend it.</p>
               <p>Before I make an end of this, let us take a view of the Ramble, which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has cut out for <hi>Timothy</hi> this Year. <hi>Timothy</hi> went from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> about <hi>Easter,</hi> to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and so to <hi>Corinth:</hi> he came back from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Ephesus</hi> again, where he arrived by <hi>Whitsontide:</hi> He followed <hi>Paul</hi> shortly, after into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> thence some way or other was got to <hi>Ephesus</hi> once more. St. <hi>Paul</hi> fetches him back unto <hi>Maceaonia</hi> again, carries him with him unto <hi>Corinth,</hi> so to <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> back to <hi>Corinth,</hi> thence once more unto <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and so to <hi>Miletus,</hi> where he took up his Quarters of Refreshment, as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> believes: and indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>O.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> At <hi>Paul'</hi>s writing the first Epistle, <hi>Timothy</hi> was Valetudinary. True, but at his writing the second, he might be recovered and confirmed in his Health: it does not appear he <hi>was still sickly.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>For the same Reason (<hi>sc.</hi> because he was a Young Man) <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Timothy Son,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> I am perswaded does not believe himself, when he urges this as an Argument, for <hi>Timothy'</hi>s being a Young Man. Was <hi>Onesimus</hi> a Young Man, when <hi>Paul</hi> called him his <hi>Son, Phil. v.</hi> 10? Was <hi>Mark</hi> a Young Man, whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls his <hi>Son,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 13? Were all those Believers Young Men, of whom St. <hi>John</hi> speaks, 3 Epi. 4.? Or were all the Christians at <hi>Corinth</hi> Young Men? And yet <hi>Paul</hi> calls 'em his <hi>Sons,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 14. But, he calls 'em so for a quite different Reason than is assigned by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> viz. <hi>Because in Christ Jesus he had begotten them through the Gospel,</hi> 1. Cor. 4. 14. And on the same account he Challenged <hi>Onesimus</hi> for his Son (<hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Philem.</hi>) <hi>Whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:30465:26"/>There are Sundry Reasons, why Men are wont to call others their Sons; which I will not insift on. One among the rest is, when there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Age: Then the Older will call the Younger <hi>Son,</hi> though the Younger has past his Juvenile Years.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>T. N.</hi> I gave another different Reason of <hi>Paul'</hi>s calling <hi>Timothy Son,</hi> which I hope will satisfy every Body, but one who will be pleased with nothing, but his own Phansies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> In his next Reason for the Second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> being writ in <hi>Paul'</hi>s first Imprisonment, many things are affirmed, but nothing proved, <q>He asserts, that that Second Epistle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 133.</note> before those to the <hi>Philippians, Colossians</hi> and <hi>Philemon, Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy'</hi>s Name being prefixt to them; which therefore supposes, <hi>Timothy</hi> now got to <hi>Rome,</hi> according to <hi>Paul'</hi>s Order, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 9.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Proper Answer hereunto is, that <hi>Paul'</hi>s Writing unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 9. to come to him at <hi>Rome,</hi> agrees every whit as well with Mine as Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Hypothesis. The Question then between us, is not to be decided hereby, but by other Circumstances, which are to be spoken of anon. And to cut off all unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary jangle, the same I reply to his third Argument, taken from <hi>Mark'</hi>s being with <hi>Paul</hi> in his first Bonds: The same Circumstances may agree to the same Persons at different times.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>Phansies that <hi>Paul'</hi>s sufferings mentioned, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11. which happen'd at <hi>Iconium, Lystra</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> Twenty Years before the Apostle's Second Imprisonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> imply, that that Second Epistle was written sooner, than his second Imprisonment: for the Apostle would not ('tis likely) mention Events so long since past, when there were other later Sufferings of his, that were much fresher in his Memory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> First, if there be any force in such kind of weak Reasonings as these, then I ask, supposing with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> this second Epistle written in the Apostle's first Bonds, why, did he not rather mention his latter Sufferings at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which <hi>Timothy</hi> (being then in <hi>Asia</hi> according to Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) knew little of, and were the the last that had happen'd unto the Apostle, except those inconsiderable ones at <hi>Rome?</hi> But the plain account of this Passage is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> is now animating <hi>Timothy</hi> to undergo Afflictions, as became a Minister of Jesus Christ: To this end the Apostle lays before him, his own Example, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. and instances in his own Sufferings at <hi>Iconium,</hi> &amp;c. But 'twas indifferent which of his Sufferings. He offered unto <hi>Timothy'</hi>s consideration: one as well as another, a former as well as a latter would set forth <hi>Paul'</hi>s <hi>Faith, Long-suffering, Charity, Patience,</hi> and Demonstrate God's Goodness and Protection of such as endure Persecution for his name's sake: because God had <hi>delivered</hi> Paul <hi>out of them all.</hi> And might not <hi>Paul</hi> say all this unto <hi>Timothy</hi> in his second as well as in his first Imprisonment? If Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has no better Arguments than such as these, to prove the second Epistle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Apostle's first Imprisonment, he had better keep 'em to himself: they betray the want of good Evidence, and the weakness of his Hypothesis, rather than Establish it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> advances another Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> "from <hi>Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>

this second Epistle must be written about the same time, as that to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> was, <hi>sc.</hi> in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But what absurdity is it to believe, and assert that <hi>Tychicus</hi> carry'd those Epistles to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and <hi>Colossians,</hi> from <hi>Paul</hi> a Prisoner at <hi>Rome</hi> the first time? and then in the Apostles second Bonds, afterward to have once more been sent to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as is exprest 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. As if <hi>Tychicus</hi> might not have been with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> in both Imprisonments. These things were noted in <hi>T.

               <p>Here let it be observed how Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. proves that <hi>Tychicus</hi> went along with <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> and <hi>Colossians:</hi> This is plain beyond Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Tychicus</hi> certainly went with <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> at the Apostles first Imprisonment. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has demonstrated it. But is it not every whit as plain that <hi>Timothy</hi> also was one of those who accompany'd <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Macedonia</hi> into <hi>Asia, Act.</hi> 20. 4. and do we not find that he was with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome, Philip</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 23? And does it not then follow according to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s own Argument (when the Interest of his Cause is forgot or not concerned) that <hi>Timothy</hi> went with <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> at his first Imprisonment? If this be a good proof of <hi>Tychicus</hi> going along with <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> 'tis as good for <hi>Timothy's.</hi> Thus all Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s petty Arguments and Sophisms, for <hi>Paul'</hi>s writing the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in his first Bonds are overthrown by himself. Great is Truth, and sometimes breaks forth, and shines through the thickest Mists of Prejudice and Prepossession. The Conceit then of <hi>Timothy'</hi>s being left behind <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> invented merely to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Cause (that of <hi>Paul'</hi>s writing the second Epistle in his first Bonds) is now out of Doors, and henceforth forever to be laid aside.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>O.</hi>

                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 134.</note> because it mentions his being delivered from his Confinement, which he was not delivered from in his second Bonds. In the second Epistle 4. 17. <hi>He was delivered out of the Mouth of the Lion, that all the</hi> Gentiles <hi>might hear the Gospel,</hi> that is, that he might go about, and Preach the Gospel to many Nations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has unworthily inverted the Order of the Words, and so drawn 'em to a wrong sense. Thus the Apostle writes — <hi>The Lord stood with me, and Strengthen'd me, that by me, the Preaching might be fully known, and that all the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>might hear: and I was delivered out of the Mouth of the Lion.</hi> The sense of which Words is plainly this, that <hi>Paul</hi> by some Special Assistance from God, so well pleaded his own, and the Cause of the Gospel at the Tribunal of <hi>Caesar</hi> (where <hi>all the Gentiles,</hi> a great number of the Principal Courtiers, and others being Present) heard him, That he escaped Condemnation at that time: He was delivered out of the Mouth of the Lion; his deliverance was the Effect of the good management of this Cause or vindicating the Truth of the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Roman Gentiles.</hi> But as for the <hi>Gentiles in other Nations,</hi> hearing the Gospel it was not the effect of his Deliverance at this time as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> by mispla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the parts of the Text would have it understood. Besides, when 'tis said, <hi>I was delivered,</hi> it is not said, <hi>from his Confinement,</hi> as if he had been immediately set at Liberty (for then he would not have sent for <hi>Timothy</hi>) but rather have gone to him according to his Intentions (as is supposed by Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) But because
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30465:27"/>
he sent for <hi>Timothy</hi> after the deliverance here spoken of it follows, that he was still a Prisoner, though he had for once escaped with Life. Lastly, if this was his Deliverance from his first Imprisonment, then he could not write to <hi>Timothy</hi> to come unto him: because <hi>Timothy</hi> was with him already,<note n="*" place="margin">As Mr. O. has elsewhere supposed.</note> That is before his Enlargement from his first Bonds. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 23.

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Demas</hi> was with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in his first Imprisonment, <hi>Colos.</hi> 4. 14. we read nothing of his being there in his second Imprisonment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a manifest difference between <hi>Paul'</hi>s Imprisonment, described in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which clearly proves the second Epistle written in <hi>Paul'</hi>s latter Imprisonment, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> In the first <hi>Demas</hi> was with him, and because there was then little or no Danger, <hi>Demas</hi> stuck close to him: but in the latter, when all turned away from him, <hi>Demas</hi> among the rest (then also with the Apostle at <hi>Rome</hi>) forsook him in the Extremity. This account is very Natural. Is it not possible, Yea probable that <hi>Demas</hi> was with him in both Imprisonments? Besides 'tis an unsufferable Impertinence to urge such kind of Arguments, as are reconcilable with both sides of the Question; such is <hi>Demas's</hi> attendance upon <hi>Paul</hi> in his Bonds. But whereas he adds, that <hi>we read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30465:28"/>
an Observation upon his Principles, that nothing could have been said more absurdly. For on his Supposition, that the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Paul'</hi>s first Imprisonment, where should we read in Scripture of <hi>Demas,</hi> being with <hi>Paul</hi> in his second Imprisonment, which on this Hypothesis is not mentioned any where in Scripture? But because a second Imprisonment is on all hands acknowledg'd, any unprejudiced Person will own, that we have the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it plainly enough intimated, in the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which cannot agree with his first Imprisonment, as I noted in <hi>T.

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> speaks not here of his approaching Martyrdom, but intimates that being now old and worn with Travels, and hard Labour, and now in Bonds, he could not last long.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Paul,</hi> it must be confest, even in his first Imprisonment, stiles himself <hi>the Aged, Philem.</hi> v. 9. But let us enquire into his Age. At <hi>Stephen'</hi>s Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he was a Young Man (I'll suppose as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has of <hi>Timothy</hi>) about Twenty Five Years old, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 58. and this was in the Thirty Fourth Year of Christ. In the Sixty Second Year of Christ, he was first Prisoner at <hi>Rome.</hi> So that at his writing the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will have to be in his first Imprisonment (as that to <hi>Philemon</hi> was) the Apostle was but about Fifty Three or Fifty Four Years old. He was but in his <hi>viridi Senectute</hi> in his first, and Green old Age. It was not then his extream old Age, which put him in mind of his sudden dissolution now at hand, as it were in the course of Nature. Neither was it any decay of Health, and Strength occasioned by his Labours, and the hardships which he had met with. We read not that he ever was Sick or Weak, or under any disorder as to his bodily Health. That he continued vigorous, and healthful after his first Imprisonment must be acknowledged, when we remember that after his Release (as is not denied by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> himself) he went <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Unto the utmost limits of the West,</hi> preaching the Gospel, which he could never have undertaken, had he been wasted with Pains and Travels. Nor did his Bonds in the first Imprisonment, intimate that his Death was then at hand. For he had all along great hopes of enlargement, as
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30465:29"/>
has been oft noted out of his Epistles. But it was a violent Death he then foresaw, and that he was to be offered up as a Sacrifice, by the shedding of his Bloud (so <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denotes), to be made a Martyr or Witness of Jesus Christ. Nothing is more plain than this, if we would lay aside our Prejudices.</p>

In that to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he puts the Case, <hi>If I be offered; I joy and rejoice,</hi> and will undergo it Gladly: this is not an expectation, but a meer supposition of Death or Martyrdom, as is plain from verse 24 — <hi>But I trust in the Lord, that I also my self shall come shortly.</hi> So that <hi>Paul</hi> looked not for Death at this time: as he did at the Writing of the second to <hi>Timothy.</hi>

As for <hi>Paul'</hi>s <hi>dying daily,</hi> I suppose none will allow it as pertinently urged. Lastly, when the Apostle says, <hi>we are always delivered unto Death,</hi> he has an Eye in General unto the Hazards they were constantly exposed unto, but not to any particular designed time of his own Death. But here in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>St. Paul</hi> speaks positively in the present Tense, without any Reserve or Limitation <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis true <hi>Paul</hi> was this once delivered out of the Mouth of the Lion: but it does not follow that he shall be again delivered: Yes says Mr. <hi>O.</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows — <hi>And the Lord shall deliver me.</hi> It is an Elegancy to apply a former word or expression unto a different matter. He had said, <hi>I was delivered</hi> from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death; and then passes off quite to another thing, and says He — <hi>The Lord shall deliver me,</hi> From what? <hi>From every evil work,</hi> from doing any thing in the present pressures, and dangers unworthy of a Christian or Apostle and thereby <hi>will preserve me to his everlasting Kingdom.</hi>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> did not expect to die very suddenly,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is truly observed and very obvious, and therefore we do not affirm that <hi>Paul</hi> certainly expected to die, <hi>so very suddenly,</hi> but that he might send for <hi>

                     </gap>.</hi> It sufficeth to say, that he expected not to be loosed from these Bonds, but by Martyrdom at last. That He judged at the writing of this Epistle, his Death might be deferred for some time, haply till <hi>Timothy</hi> came. Still Death <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that <hi>Paul</hi> was now already under a Sentence of Death; and that for the same reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had sent for <hi>Timothy.</hi> We rather affirm that his deliverance, <hi>out of the Mouth of the Lion,</hi> was only his escaping the Sentence of Condemnation at that time: That he was remanded unto Prison, and reserved for another Trial, when ever it pleased the Emperor to appoint it. Or else to be Sacrificed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fury of that Bloudy Prince, <hi>Nero,</hi> by a sudden and Arbitrary or extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Decree, as I rather believe.</p>
               <p>One great Argument with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> at his Farewel committed unto the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders, the Supreme Government of that Church, as the perpetual and unalterable Method of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,<note place="margin">Acts. 20.</note> is because, he <hi>knew he should never see there Faces more,</hi> Act. 20. 25. Or rather that, <hi>They should never see his Face any more.</hi> I offered at a small Criticism on the Explication of this Passage, but laid no stress on it. The Minister takes a great deal of<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 139.</note> pains in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this: how well let others judge. I am not concerned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>does my-Argument require me to Justify that Gloss. Only it may be worth the while to remember that though <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>They should not all see his Face any more;</hi> Yet <hi>Timothy</hi> did according to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s own Hypothesis, and so did <hi>Trophimus</hi> the <hi>

                     </gap>,</hi> who went with him to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Besides, 'tis hard to believe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> should so peremptorily affert without exception, that not one of 'em should see his Face any more. But as I said, I insist not on this. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> who busies himself in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> what I made no account of would have better employ'd himself, if he had more solidly replied to what I laid most weight on, that is, that the Apostle's saying, <hi>I know</hi> was only Conjectural: <hi>Paul</hi> thought so; but he was not absolutely assured of it. But</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is of Opinion that this is sufficient to his purpose, that <hi>Paul thought</hi> they should see his Face no more. That therefore he was not wanting in his Duty of settling the Government, but gave his final Orders on that Point, constituting the Elders, the Governours of that Church, because he had no hopes of seeing them any more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I have had occasion more than once in this Book to acquaint the Reader, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not now (so far as we find in Scripture) commit the Supreme Government unto the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders. That the 28. Verse in the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Acts</hi> reaches not that sense, as is before made out, and shall be once more before I conclude this Chapter. Mean while supposing he had delivered the Supreme Power into their hands, yet the Government might be altered, or perfected afterwards upon occasion by the same Divine Power, which first constituted it. But after all this,</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> not content with this Argument of his, urges, <q>That <hi>Paul doth</hi> not use to express himself to positively — <hi>I know,</hi> when he speaks <hi>Conjecturally.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:30465:30"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In all Reason the Apostle ought to be his own Interpreter. And he tells the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 22. that <hi>he knew not the things that should be fall him there,</hi> (at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>) How then could <hi>Paul</hi> say absolutely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reserve or condition, that they should see his Face no more? If <hi>Festus</hi> had sent <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> by Land, through <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> through <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Troas,</hi> as he might, if he had pleased, and <hi>Paul</hi> knew not the Contrary, then the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders must have seen his Face once more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. I do undertake to produce an Instance of <hi>Paul'</hi>s speaking as perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily or positively, as he does here in the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Acts,</hi> and yet Mr. <hi>O.</hi> shall and has confest it, spoken conjecturally or uncertainly, as of a future contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. I send him then to <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 25. <hi>The Apostle had said, that he desired to be disolved: but that to abide in the flesh was more necessary for them</hi> — <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>And having this confidence I know I shall abide and continue with you all.</hi> The Case here is this (that I may accommodate my self to the ordinary, and less observant Reader) <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epistle from <hi>Rome</hi> in his first Imprisonment, he tells the <hi>Philippians</hi> that <hi>he knew he should abide and continue with them,</hi> which implies his return unto the Eastern-Churches, and particularly into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> whereof <hi>Philippi</hi> was a principal City: and yet Mr. <hi>O.</hi> all along disputes, and denies the certainty of <hi>Paul'</hi>s going back into the Eastern parts, though <hi>Paul</hi> assured the <hi>Philippians</hi> with an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the same word which he used when he spake thus to the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders, <hi>I know that ye shall see my Face no more.</hi> If then the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>I know,</hi> is but Conjectural in the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> must grant) why not in the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Acts?</hi> Why then does Mr. <hi>O.</hi> deny <hi>Paul</hi> returned into the East, after his enlargement out of Prison, grounding himself on <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 25. If he was positive in the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> and in the <hi>Acts,</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has lost one half of his Argument, and besides is obliged to reconcile <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> But I, who allow both spoken conjecturally, that is, with a Possibility of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, am no further concerned than to prove that <hi>de facto,</hi> he went back into the East, which (I suppose) is sufficiently demonstrated already.</p>
               <p>From what has been said in this Chapter, it is manifest that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has in no tolerable degree vindicated the Old Chronology, which fixt upon the 20<hi>th</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> as the time of <hi>Paul'</hi>s <hi>beseeching</hi> Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was going to</hi> Macedonia: neither has he produced any one good Argument, that the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was wrote in the Apostle's first Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Rome.</hi> Once more I observe if he had evinced both these (as is also noted in <hi>T. N.</hi>) it would not be a sufficient proof of the Presbyterian Parity. For I once again repeat it, that I did not avoid that older Opinion, which allows the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to have been written in <hi>Paul'</hi>s first Imprisonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> consequently, that the first Epistle was written before the Apostle's taking leave of the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders, and by Consequence, that he besought <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when He was going to <hi>Macedonia, Acts</hi> 20. 1. I did not, I say, lay aside this old Hypothesis, as if Episcopacy was not defensible on that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but rather to bring the Controversy into as narrow a compass as might be. I did therefore in the latter end of the Third Chapter, in <hi>T. N.</hi> shew that though <hi>Paul</hi> had before the Congress at <hi>Miletus,</hi> constituted <hi>Timothy</hi> the Ruler (Bishop) of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> yet was he not obliged to take notice of <hi>Timothy</hi> in that, his Farewel-Sermon. Because <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30465:30"/>
to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and that First and Second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> takes no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Elders, neither does <hi>John, Peter,</hi> or <hi>Jude</hi> in their Epistles, nor last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, does <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> make mention of either Bishop, Presbyter or Deacon: but shall we thence conclude, that those Churches had none of those Officers in them? Is it not as reasonable to believe that <hi>Timothy</hi> the then supposed Ruler (Bishop) of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> might be omitted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in his Farewel-Sermon, as the Presbyters in his first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> wherein he professedly Treats of Church-Government, and one would think could not have forgot'em, when he was discoursing on such an Argument. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly let it be remembred that <hi>Ignatius</hi> himself, whose other Epistles so often, and so fully remember Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, in that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> had not oneSyllable of any of'em; and yet he knew very well that Bishops (as well as Presbyters) were then established throughout the World, as he Witnesses in that to the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> 'Tis then no Proof that <hi>Timothy,</hi> was not even at that time the established Ruler (Bishop) of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> because the Apostle thought not fit to mention him in his Farewel Sermon. These things Mr. <hi>O.</hi> was pleased to pass by unanswered: and why, let any one judge. I am sure they overthrow the best Argument the Dissenters have against Bishop <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now whether (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> pleads) <hi>Paul</hi> Acts 20. <hi>Commits</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 139.</note> 
                  <hi>the Government of</hi> Ephesus <hi>to the Presbyters only, not by a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential or Temporary Constitution, but Divine,</hi> by the Power of the Holy Ghost, <hi>v.</hi> 28. enough has been said of this already. Nevertheless it may be proper to repeat a little for the satisfaction of those, who haply have not read the <hi>T. N.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do then acknowledge, that the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders were made Overseers of the Church by the Holy Ghost, having Power to feed the Flock committed to their Charge. But this is no Argument against <hi>Timothy'</hi>s Bishoprick there, or his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Power over them. For it is not inconsistent to say, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their Ruler (Bishop); and at the same time, that the Presbyters were made Overseers of the Flock under <hi>Timothy.</hi> We Presbyters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do believe our ourselves to be Overseers of the Flock, and that by Divine Authority too; and yet at the same time we acknowledge our Diocesans to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side over us, by the same Divine Authority. Our Bishops themselves declare as much in their Atlmonition at the Ordering of Priests, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, Watchmen and Stewards of the Lord, to teach, premonish, feed, and provide for the Lord's Family, and to seek for Christ's Sheep, that are dispersed abroad.</hi> And at our Ordination, the first Question is — <hi>Do ye think in your Hearts, that ye be truly called according to the will of our Lord Jesus Christ?</hi> What is all this less than that spoken to the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders — <hi>Over which the Holy Ghost has made you Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers to feed the Church of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It follows not then from these words, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> put into the Presbyters hands the sole, intire; and supreme Government of that Church. They might even then be, and be left subject unto Bishop <hi>Timothy</hi> (for any thing that can be rightly inferred from thence) as we are to our Diocesan Bishops. If our Provincial Archbishop, should at his Metropolitical Visitation at the same rate, exhort as ordinary Presbyters — <hi>To take heed to our selves, and to the Flock over which the Holy Ghost has made us overseers, to feed the Church of God,</hi> not mentioning our Diocesan Bishops at all, shall it thence be concluded that Dr. <hi>Stratford</hi> our Reverend Diocesan is not the Bishop of <hi>Chester?</hi> These things I

               <p>Before I conlude this Chapter, there are two Arguments which the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opposition Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has made unto my Hypothesis, has suggested to me, proving, I am bold to say, <hi>demonstrating,</hi> that the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was wrote in St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Second Imprisonment at <hi>Rome.</hi> I will lay 'em as briefly, and as plainly as I can before the Reader, and so make an end.</p>

How then could <hi>Tychicus</hi> be the Bearer of the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> if he was already gone to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> before the writing of that Epistle to the <hi>Colossians?</hi> The second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> therefore could not be written <hi>before</hi> that unto the <hi>Colossians.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Not <hi>at the same time,</hi> as the Epistles to the <hi>Colossians</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> were written. For <hi>Timothy,</hi> who in the second Epistle to <hi>

And all this during the Apostle's first Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is not in the least Probable. 'Tis such a Wild-Goose-Chase, as no rational Man can admit. Therefore the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was not written <hi>after</hi> that to the <hi>Colossians.</hi> If then it was written neither <hi>before,</hi> nor <hi>at the same time,</hi> nor <hi>after</hi> those to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and <hi>Philemon,</hi> it was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at all during the Apostle's first Imprisonment, therefore it must needs have been written in his Second.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other Argument is grounded upon the Story of <hi>Demas,</hi> as 'tis related in the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Philemon,</hi> I shall represent it first according to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Hypothesis, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly according to my own.</p>
               <p>According to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Hypothesis, <hi>Demas</hi> had forsaken<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> loving this present World, and was departed to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> before the Apostle wrote that second Epistle to <hi>Timothy. Paul</hi> in the same second Epistle, after <hi>Demas</hi> had forsaken him, sent for <hi>Timothy</hi> from <hi>Asia</hi> unto <hi>Rome, (v. 9.). Timothy</hi> being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> joined with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Epistles to the <hi>Colossians (Chap.</hi> 1. 1.) and to <hi>Philemon (v.</hi> 1.) and yet <hi>Demas</hi> was still with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> even though he had forsaken <hi>Paul,</hi> and he is by the Apostle and <hi>Timothy,</hi> mentioned with Honour in both Epistles, <hi>Colos.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Philem.</hi> 24. after he had forsaken the Apostle. This is absurd enough.</p>

               <p>But according to my Hypothesis, <hi>Demas</hi> continued with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> all his first Imprisonment there being little or no danger: at this time <hi>Paul</hi> wrote the Epistles to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> and that to <hi>Philemon,</hi> and therein Commends <hi>Demas,</hi> there being then no reason to the Contrary. But in the Apostle's second Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Christian Religion (and the Apostle in particular) was more violently persecuted, then the Apostle wrote the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and then <hi>Demas</hi> had deserted <hi>Paul,</hi> and withdrawn himself into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as indeed <hi>all Men then forsook him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16.

                  <p>I Must not deny, as I once before acknowledged, that I borrowed my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, about the time of <hi>Paul'</hi>s beseeching <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> from Bishop <hi>P.</hi> and that I believed him, to have been the first publick Author of it.

Infirmities, of what kind soever they be. But let us examine these Fourteen Years, which he Challengeth me with. Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> perhaps computes the time so as will reach Fourteen Years: but he's none of my Oracle. I am of Opinion, he has scarce spoken one true word, in matters relating unto this Controversy, and this happen'd by the first false step he made, about the time of <hi>Paul'</hi>s beseeching <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. But I can reduce these Fourteen Years into Seven, all which time <hi>Paul</hi> had not an opportunity of applying the Remedy; and thus I do it. With Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> I reckon the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schism to have happen'd in the Year of Christ 57. A Year he tarry'd in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> about two Years I allow for his stay at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and Voyage to <hi>Rome.</hi> He remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Years a Prisonér there, and two Years may be allotted for his Return into the East, visiting and settling the Government of those Churches; in all about Seven, which at least in the Gross agree with Bishop <hi>Pearson'</hi>s Chronology. But whereas Mr. <hi>O.</hi> makes me say, the first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to <hi>Timothy</hi> was writ <hi>Anno</hi> 69. It is a Palpable Mistake (to say no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.) He hereby imputes unto me at least Four or five Years more than I ever reckon'd upon. Well! but how came <hi>Paul</hi> to defer changing the Government, so long as Seven or Eight Years? This doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will think strange, and not to be granted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Reason is obvious from the History of <hi>Paul.</hi> The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schism broke out: <hi>Paul</hi> endeavour'd to heal it by Argument, and proceeded no further with them at that time. He therefore receives their Contributions, hastes to <hi>Judea,</hi> is there Imprisoned, sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there held in Durance two Years. After he returns into the East: by this time the like Schism had burst out at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and haply in other Churches: and now was the time, and the first fair opportunity he had to alter or perfect the Government, and to place <hi>Timothy,</hi> in his stead over the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and others over the rest.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is so natural to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to Challenge me with <hi>Confidence,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear even when I least deserve it. I am therefore obliged for once, to set the Saddle on the right Horse: for I'll not resemble him to blind <hi>Bayard,</hi> as he very rudely doth me.</p>
                  <p>In that Paragraph, to which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> refers, in the <hi>T. N.</hi> I gave a Summary of <hi>Paul'</hi>s Travels in the East, after his Enlargement from his first Imprisonment at <hi>Rome:</hi> wherein I am far from <hi>confidently affirming,</hi> all his particular movements from place to place, tho' I guess at them. I over and over, and yet more than once over again delivered my Opinion with so much Precaution, that no Man of the least Modesty would have Tax'd me with <hi>Confidence</hi> on that score. If any one is at leisure to inform himself in the Truth, let him but turn to the 87th page of <hi>T. N.</hi> and he'll presently see what care I took, and what modesty I us'd in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing my own Thoughts, what frequent Interruptions and Parentheses I all along inserted, varying and repeating them meerly, that I might not seem too positive in such minute Circumstances. <hi>Ex. gr. As may reasonably be supposed.</hi> Again, <hi>'tis likely.</hi> And again, <hi>This may be allow'd.</hi> And once more, <hi>very probably.</hi> Then I conclude <hi>Hitherto we have built upon Conjecture.</hi>

                  <item>3. That they were not only Companions of the Apostles, ready to serve in the Work of the Gospel, where-ever &amp; whensoever they should be sent upon any special and Emergent business: but sometimes likewise fix'd in some certain places as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident Governours of those Churches, in the Room of the absent or dying Apostles, of which number I reckon'd <hi>Philip, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to have been.</item>

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>Because <hi>Titus</hi> was to Ordain Elders in every City,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 143.</note> and every City must have a Bishop (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> phansies) <hi>Titus</hi> therefore must have been the Archbishop of <hi>Crete;</hi> and because the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Ordination was lodg'd in him alone, as the Rector contends, it will follow (says he) that Archbishops only have power to Ordain, and the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishops are excluded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no necessity that every City must needs have a Bishop. At least in the Infancy of the Church, and whilst <hi>Titus</hi> alone presided over it. It was not so in <hi>Crete,</hi> nor was there any occasion for it. Admitting that in the next Age, Christians and Churches multiplying, and all the Apostles dead then, haply there might be Bishops in many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and some Person constituted the Archbishop of that Island. I say admitting this, it will not hence follow, that the Power of Ordination was in him solely, and not in the other Bishops also. An Archbishop is not of a different species from a Bishop, but was appointed, and agreed unto by the Bishops among themselves for Peace and Orders sake; although there might be plausible Reasons given out of Scripture it self, for the Institution of Archbishops. But that's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of my concernment. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain among our selves, when a Bishop is made an Archbishop, he receives no new Ordination, consequently no new Divine Power, more than he had before; that therefore as to the Office of Ordaining and Governing their Dioceses, a Bishop and an Archbishop are the same thing, and that the Archbishop cannot supersede the Episcopal Power, of his Provincial Bishops.</p>

I have all the Cities in <hi>Judea</hi> (to say nothing of all the other in the Empire, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, where Jews liv'd) to set against <hi>Caesarea.</hi> His name would make one think he was an <hi>Hellenist,</hi> and born somewhere among the Greeks. His being chosen a Deacon, in favour of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> argues something this way: as also that, at that time his Habitation was at <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> for why else should he be chosen a Deacon there? He removed thence meerly upon occasion of the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. After all, imagine he was born at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> this is no reason against his being an Evangelist there. Once more, <hi>He might Marry there.</hi> True, that's possible: but 'tis as possible that he Marry'd at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or any other of the Cities, where he had preached the Word. But Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Reason why he might Marry there, is a very pleasant one, <hi>sc.</hi> because <hi>he had Daughters there Prophetesses:</hi> as if he might not have Marry'd in another place, and yet his Daughters live with him at <hi>Caesarea.</hi> Children are no evidence, where a Man was Marry'd. But what if he was Marryed there? Might he not also have been the settled E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist there? His Marrying at <hi>Caesarea</hi> could be no hindrance, nor is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against it. Lastly, 'tis most absurd to suppose from <hi>Acts</hi> the 8. 40. That he Marry'd at <hi>Caesarea.</hi> For 'twas now about 20 Years since he arriv'd first at <hi>Caesarea.</hi> There Mr. <hi>O.</hi> thinks he might Marry, and so settle his Family. I deny it. He must in all likelyhood have been Marry'd before he ever came to <hi>Caesarea;</hi> and that because he had four Daughters Prophetesses. For if he was there, and then Marry'd, the oldest of these Prophetesses must have been but Nineteen Years old, and the youngest but Sixteen. It is not credible, that at this Age they should be Prophetesses. Lastly, the most probable conjecture is, that he Marry'd before he was converted, or became a Minister of the Word.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is no wonder that Bp. <hi>Pearson</hi> should be of this Opinion, who esteem'd an Evangelist to be, not a distinct Species of Officer in the Church, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a bare Preacher of the Gospel.

And this is what I insisted on in <hi>T. N.</hi> that Evangelists were both fixt and unfixt, according as the Apostles Ordered them, that therefore fixedness, or unfixedness is not a proper Note, nor distinguishing Character of an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list; he may be one, or the other, or both at different times, as is manifest from <hi>Eusebius.</hi> Though I delivered my self in <hi>T. N.</hi> to this effect, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> takes no notice of it, but urges again the old Argument, avoiding what I observed out of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> in proof that his unfixt Evangelists, became afterwards the fixt Bishops of Churches.</p>
               <p>It remains then that Evangelists, many of 'em were according to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> fixt Ministers, which is all I am concerned for; and by Consequence so might <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> be.</p>
               <p>Another Controversy is moved about St. <hi>Mark,</hi> whether<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I do readily grant, that <hi>Mark</hi> was a great while an unsettled Minister, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> and by him dispatched up and down, upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, though afterward he went, or was sent unto <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where he planted a Church, and Govern'd it.<note place="margin">Euseb.

                  <hi>Mark</hi> was the Evangelist of it, the Administrator of that Church, having not as yet perhaps received the Title of Bishop as particularly belonging to him. But</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> shakes me off by objecting — <hi>I may as well make</hi> Peter <hi>a Resident Apostle, because</hi> Eusebius <hi>saith, that</hi> Linus <hi>succeeded him in the Government of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Supposing <hi>Peter</hi> was there, so long as 'tis reported of him, I must profess I think he was the Resident Apostle of <hi>Rome,</hi> for there are Men of Learning and Observation, who will tell Mr. <hi>O.</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was the first Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> that Apostles were wont to have the special care and oversight over some particular Church or Churches, besides their general Power, which extended unto all Places. Of <hi>Peter, Jerom</hi> testifies — <hi>ibi<expan>

They will tell him, that the removing from place to place, and from one City or Country to another, was not of the Essence of an Apostle: that they might, if they thought fit, remove, or else continue and fix. That if an Apostle upon some Emergent Occasion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to another place,

this proves not that he was not before his removal, the settled Minister of the former Church; no more than when a Non-con Minister leaves his former Congregation, and running into a remote Country adheres to a new one. Will Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in this case deny that he was ever the settled Minister of the former? They will tell him, that an Apostle when he removed, did still hold (even in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) the Government of the Church which he left, until he thought fit to fix his Successour, or was by Death prevented taking any further care of it. There want not Examples of this kind. Thus 'tis believed, <hi>Euodius</hi> succeeded <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the Apostles Life time, and <hi>Linus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> after his Death.

For though we read of some removals of these two Persons, yet it was not in Order to Preach the Gospel, but on some other Account. Their first movement was from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Corinth</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This then was not moving up and down <hi>into divers places, by the Apostles Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> to Preach the Gospel: but in Obedience to the Civil Magistrates, and for their own security. The other motion was in Company with <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> proceeding in his Journey towards <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> left <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla, Act.</hi> 18. 19, 21.

I rather think it was because they were all of the same Craft or Trade, <hi>Tent-Makers, v.</hi> 3. and as we shall see anon, not such Evangelists as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> and I am now disputing about.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no Substance at all in this slight Gloss.

As the Evangelists were under the Conduct and Command of the Apostles, so were the Apostles under the Conduct and Determination of the Spirit, as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> confesses.

               <p>But to pass over abundance of Trivial Observations made by the Minister, I will here endeavour to explain the meaning of this dark Passage of St. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi> which I suspect Mr. <hi>O.</hi> either does not, or will not understand, or has not duly considered. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In which Words his meaning is (as I conceive) that there were a sort of Evangelists, who went not up and down to Preach the Gospel <hi>Publickly,</hi> but only taught and instructed some People that came to them, <hi>privately at home,</hi> and such were <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> so we read of 'em, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 26.

St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> goes on, and having in the fourth and last Place named <hi>Pastors and Teachers,</hi> he puts the Question to himself <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>Less than those, who travel abroad and preach publickly,</hi> as being invested with the Evangelical Office: But not less than <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> who were only <hi>private Evangelists.</hi> Thus far St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> has informed us of two sorts of Evangelists.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The private, who went not up and down to Propagate the Gospel in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but at home only and privately.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as did travel up and down, and were publick Evangelists. Here there ought to be a full Point. Then he proceeds <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The meaning whereof is more fully — <hi>There are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists, who reside, and continue in one place, as</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus. He had spoken before of private Evangelists, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> and of Publick Evangelists, who travelled abroad and preached the Gospel, and now Thirdly, he mentions another sort of Evangelists, who were fixt and resided in a certain place <hi>as</hi> Timothy, <hi>and</hi> Titus. Which how far it favours Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s. Opinion I leave to the Judgment of the Reader. If any one else offers me a better explication of this obscure passage in <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> I shall thankfully embrace it. In the mean time, I believe, it makes nothing for my Adversary, nor does it in the least distress me. Yea, it agrees with my notion and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as I have Expounded him, and I presume agreeably to his meaning. St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> Lastly, mentions a fourth sort of Evangelists, <hi>sc.</hi> who wrote the Gospels, but they come not under the present Subject.</p>

                  <q>Lastly, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> pleads <hi>that</hi> Chrysostom, <hi>doth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 149.</note> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>among Evangelists, but among Pastors and Teachers.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> How then is <hi>Chrysostom</hi> of Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s side, as he boasted before? How will he thence prove that Evangelists travelled up and down as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did? And what becomes of Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s constant affirming, they were Evangelists, and extraordinary Officers? But if my Exposition holds good, as I hope it will, then <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> are reckon'd among fixt Evangelists, and not among Pastors and Teachers. Besides, I am not concerned among whom <hi>Chrysostom</hi> reckons 'em: they were fixt according to <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and the sole and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power was committed to 'em by <hi>Paul,</hi> as is plain in the Epistles. Whatever then their Title was, they were the settled Rulers of those Churches.</p>
               <p>Finally Mr. <hi>O.</hi> cites <hi>Eusebius</hi> for saying, <hi>It was only reported, that</hi> Timothy <hi>was the first Bishop of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>but that there was no certainty, who succeeded the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in the Government of the Churches,</hi> &amp;c. for which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Euseb. H. E.</hi> l. 3. c. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If <hi>Eusebius</hi> had written to this purpose, the Words however imply that some single Persons succeeded the Apostles, though it was not known of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty who they were, nor what their Names were. But setting aside this, the Principal thing here to be remark'd, is, that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> according to his usual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, has misrepresented <hi>Eusebius.</hi> The Historians Words are as follows. <q>How many, and who of the true Followers (<hi>of the Apostles</hi>) were reckoned sufficient to feed the Churches founded by<note place="margin">N. B.</note> them it is not easy to say, <hi>Those only excepted which any one may gather out of</hi> Paul'<hi>s Epistles.</hi> For this (<hi>Paul</hi>) had innumerable Fellow La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers and (as he calls 'em) Fellow-Soldiers, very many of whom were by him thought worthy of immortal Fame, he having in his Epistles given an everlasting Testimony of them, and <hi>Luke</hi> also in the <hi>Acts</hi> reckoning them by their Names. Among these <hi>Timothy</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) is reported to have receiv'd the Episcopacy of the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Diocess, even as <hi>Titus</hi> also of the Churches in <hi>Crete.</hi>
                  </q> But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> craftily transposes the Historians Words. He begins at the latter end — <hi>It was</hi> (says he) <hi>only reported that</hi> Timothy <hi>was the first Bishop of</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Then he adds, from the beginning of this long Period; <hi>That there was no certainty who succeeded the Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. As if it were but a Report, and not a certainty, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Bishops of their respective Churches. Whereas <hi>Eusebius</hi> first says, <hi>'twas uncertain how many, and who</hi> governed the Churches, that vast number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> planted by the Apostles: only he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts those mentioned by name in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>Paul'</hi>s Epistles, who certainly ruled the Churches planted by the Apostles: and among them (says he) <hi>'tis reported</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: where is this reported? Why in St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Epistles, 'tis Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed, <hi>that</hi> Timothy <hi>received the Bishoprick of</hi> Ephesns, <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>of</hi> Crete. And I hope the Testimony drawn from the Historical part of the Apostles Epistles, is not an <hi>uncertain Report.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the help of that common distinction, between <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Church-Officers, the Dissenters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> off, whatever is brought against them out of Scripture. They will tell you that the Apostles, and the Evangelists were <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Officers, and cannot be drawn into Consequence, nor made a President for Bishops, these being but <hi>Ordinary</hi> Church-Officers. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> I do
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:30465:37"/>
believe, serves himself of this subterfuge, near an hundred times in this <hi>Defence</hi> of his, and the <hi>Plea.</hi> My design then here is to examine this Distinction, that this short Chapter may rise to some degree of Proportion with the rest. The Question then is, <hi>what is an extraordinary-Officer:</hi> And my Answer is, 'tis of two kinds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Officer properly speaking is one, whose very Office is <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and Temporary. Such were the Dictators among the <hi>Romans,</hi> so long as that People preserv'd their Liberty. These Dictators were Created upon some occasion of extream danger threatning the Common-Wealth, which being over, there was an end of the Officer, and Office both. The Dictator returned back to the Plough, and the Consuls again reassumed the Administration of the publick Affairs. Of this kind is the High-Steward in <hi>England,</hi> who is constituted the chief Manager at the Coronation of the King, or Trial of a Peer. But so soon as these Solemnities are over, there's an end of the High-Steward. He breaks his Staff, the Ensign of his Honour and Office, and becomes a private Man, as he was before. Such I reckon Prophets in the Church to have been, God raising them up by an extraordinary Commission for the necessary Service of Religion: but it was not necessary, that a Prophet should have a Successor, or that the Office of a Prophet should be continued: For in the Jewish Church Prophets ceas'd, as well as in the Christian, which every one knows and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges.</p>
               <p>2. An <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Officer is one, whose Office generally speaking, at least several parts of his Office are <hi>Ordinary,</hi> necessary and of perpetual use: But who is endued with many Singular, Personal, and <hi>extraordinary</hi> qualifications, and advantages for the Discharge of his Office. Such was <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Priest of the Jews. Such were the Seventy taken in by <hi>Moses,</hi> to bear with him part of the burden of the Government. Such were the Apostles, and Evangelists, the Pastors and Teachers (many of'em) in the Apostles days as I make account, and am now about to explain.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ordinary</hi> necessary, and permanent parts of the Apostolical, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistical Offices were Preaching the Word, Administring the Sacraments, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Elders and managing the Government, and Discipline of the Church. With respect hereunto the Apostles, and Evangelists were <hi>Ordinary</hi> Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; Though having received from God, many <hi>extraordinary</hi> personal Gifts enabling them to discharge their Office more effectually; on which Account they may be called extraordinary Officers also. For so we are wont to call e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Persons of very Eminent Natural Parts, and mighty Improvements in knowledge, <hi>extraordinary Men:</hi> Much more then those, who receive their divine Abilities immediately from God. But still for all that, their Office was but <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> and it was necessary, and God appointed that there should be a Succession unto the Ordinary Apostolical, and Evangelistical Offices, (though he did not continue the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts. So it appears from those Words of our Lord — <hi>And lo, I am with you alway, to the end of the World.</hi> [Matt. 28. 20. This promise of Christ cannot be thought to belong to the Apostles personally: for they were mortal, how then could Jesus Christ <hi>be with them alway, and to the end of the World?</hi> Nor is the Promise to be understood of <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts and Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, such as were given to the Apostles and Evangelists: For we know that those ceased in the Church, in an Age or two. It remains therefore, that in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30465:37"/>
the fore-mentioned Passage, Christ promised to be with his Church alway unto the end of the World, in the <hi>Ordinary</hi> work of the Ministery, Preaching the Word, Discipling Nations, Administring the Sacrament, exercising Discipline, and Governing the Church. And from hence it follows, that they in whose hands is lodged the Power of Preaching the Word, and Administring the Sacraments, of Ordaining, and Governing the Church at this day, are Successors unto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Evangelists, and invested with the same Powers, that the Apostles and Evangelists were, though not with such <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Gifts; and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are the same Species of Church-Officers. <hi>ex. gr.</hi> Was not <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> as truly the High-Priest as <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> in the Apostles days, the same that it was in <hi>Moses'</hi>s? only excepting the Eminent Gifts, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the one, and not on the other. I conclude then, that the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Evangelistical Offices, were (if we will speak exactly) <hi>Ordinary;</hi> tho' the Apostles and Evangelists Abilities were <hi>Extraordinary.</hi> And that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Evangelists had, and to this day have, and will, and ought to have unto the end of the World, Successors in all the <hi>Ordinary</hi> parts of their Office.</p>
               <p>But it will be Objected, if the Apostolical, or Evangelistical<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> Office was succeeded to, why was the name of the Office altered? The discontinuance of the Title seems to argue the discontinuance of the Office.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is held not without Reason, that the name <hi>Apostle</hi> descended at least upon their next, and immediate Successors, which some call <hi>Secondary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> the Inseriour Ministers being indifferently called Bishops or Presbyters.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the changing of the Title of the Office cannot import the ceasing of the Office. <hi>Caesar</hi> was Emperor by the Title of <hi>Perpetual Dictator, Augustus</hi> his Successor by that of <hi>Caesar:</hi> and the following Emperors by those of <hi>Caesar</hi> and

At the Reformation in <hi>Scoltand,</hi> the Prelatical Rulers of the Churches were stiled Superintendents; yet the Office of Bishop was not therefore changed, because the Title was. The Superintendents had the same Power to inspect the Churches in their own Districts, as the Bishops had. To conclude, the change of the name Apostle into Bishop, is no prejudice against the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power, being the same as the Apostolical was, and succeeding into its place.</p>
               <p>It will again be Objected, that since Ordinary Presbyters are<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> confest on all hands, to succeed the Apostles in the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, why not then in the other parts of the Apostolical Office, <hi>sc.</hi> the Ordaining and Governing Power?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Solution of this Difficulty (such as it is) depends upon Matter of Fact, <hi>sc.</hi> how God was pleased by the Apostles to determine this Point. This is not the place to dispute the Question, whether the Apostles convey'd their whole Power and Office unto every, or to all Presbyters; it has, I am in hopes, been cleared in the Negative, both in these and my former Papers: but to the Objection I reply, that when an Office is attended with Variety of Work, it does not follow of necessity, that he who succeeds in one part of the Office, must be reckoned to succeed in all. It cannot be doubted, but the Apostles had it in their Power to divide, and put the several parts of their Office into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hands: and we have an Instance that they did so. They made seven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons unto whom they committed the care of the poor, and distribution of the publick Alms, which was before in the Apostles themselves. But then no one will say, that because the Apostles conferred upon these Seven one part of their Office, that therefore they must be understood to have committed to 'em all the rest, <hi>sc.</hi> the Powers of Ordination, of Government, and of Discipline. By parity of Reason, though Presbyters succeeded the Apostles, and were by them Ordained unto that part of the Apostolical Office, <hi>viz.</hi> Ministring in the Word and Sacraments, it will not follow, that they also received the whole Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Power, that of Ordination, Government, and Discipline. 'Tis further Objected, That the Apostolical Power extended it<note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> self <hi>every where,</hi> the Evangelistical reached to <hi>divers places</hi> and Countries, but it cannot be pretended that the Episcopal Power, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction is so large, and as it were unlimited. 'Tis rather confined unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Compass or District, as we plainly see; for which reason the Bishops are not the Apostles, nor the Evangelists Successors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis no hard matter to get over this small Rub. This unlimited Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Apostles, may be reckoned among their <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> and personal Privileges, and so does us no prejudice. The Office may be the same, though the extent of Power may be more in one than in another. The Bishop of <hi>Eugubium,</hi> was as truly a Bishop, as the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>Ptolemy</hi> was as real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to all intents and purposes, King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> had been of that, and many other vast Kingdoms and Provinces: and as he was really a King, so he was really <hi>Alexander'</hi>s Successor also. For who will say, that <hi>William

                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> was not <hi>Will.</hi> the Conqueror's Successor, because he succeeded him not in the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as well as the Kingdom of <hi>England?</hi> We see by these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that one may have several Successors, into several parts of their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. How large soever the Diocess of the Apostles or Evangelists was, yet the Bishops may be their Successors, unto some parts of their Jurisdiction. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> they who inherited any part of the Decedent's Estate (were they few, or were they many) were all called <hi>Haeredes,</hi> and distinguished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proportion allotted them. Hence we read of <hi>Haeredes ex deunce, ex quadrante, ex semuncia, ex semisse;</hi> as well as <hi>Haeres ex asse,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited all.</p>
               <p>But what if after all this, every Bishops Power extends it self through the whole World, being not in its own nature limited and fixt to any one single District? Some have thought so, and upon good ground too. After many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reasons, and Evidences of the Universal Power of Bishops given by Mr. <hi>B. p.</hi> 56.

Thus <hi>James the</hi> Apostle (or at least <hi>an</hi> Apostle) was the constant residing Prefect or Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> So was <hi>Simeon</hi> after him.

It is so difficult a matter to define exactly what Residence is, and when a Man may be said to be fixt: how oft, how long, and on what Occasions he may be allowed to be Absent, and yet at the same time be the settled Minister of a Church, that I think no Man alive can, with any tolerable certainty prononuce a Person not to have been the Resident Ruler, or Bishop of a Church, because he finds him employ'd in some other place upon some extraordinary Service of the Church. I make no difficulty to affirm, that when, and as oft as any Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent necessity requires it, and his Superior Commands him, a fixt Resident Officer may leave his Flock for some time, and attend the Business, which he is thus 'specially called to: and yet still he is their fixt and settled Minister. If <hi>Paul</hi> called <hi>Timothy</hi> to him at <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> from <hi>Crete,</hi> it will not follow they were not the fixt and Resident Rulers (Bishops) of those Churches, which the Apostle had before committed to 'em; no more than that the <hi>British</hi> Bishops, who by Order of the Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> assisted at the Council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> were not the fixt Resident Bishops of the <hi>British</hi> Churches; Or that the Members of the Assembly of Divines, were not the settled Rectors, Vicars, or Lecturers, of their respective Congregations, though they were a good while ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from 'em, and sitting at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. One may be the fixt Minister of a Church, and yet afterward remove to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place and settle there. I suppose my Neighbour Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had been the fixt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of some Congregation in the West of <hi>England,</hi> before he settled here among us. So that if for some important Reasons, <hi>Paul</hi> had quite removed <hi>Timothy</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> from <hi>Crete,</hi> appointing <hi>Tichycus</hi> in the Room of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. And <hi>Artemas</hi> to succeed the latter, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 12. This will not evince, That <hi>Timothy</hi> was never the fixt Ruler (Bishop) of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Crete.</hi> To draw toward a Conclusion all alterable Circumstances, such as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> divine Gifts, <hi>different</hi> Titles, <hi>Largeness,</hi> or extent of Power over all or very many Cities and Countries, and <hi>unfixedness</hi> as to any one City or Province, or whatever else of this kind may be alledg'd, make no difference between the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical, or Evangelistical and the Episcopal Power. It is the Ordination which conferrs the Office, and the Power, not the fixedness or unfixedness of the Ordainer. 'Tis the Power of Ordination given unto Apostles, Evangelists and Bishops, which enables 'em to Ordain others, not any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Circumstance, which is observed in any of 'em. In a word, that <hi>Ordinary</hi> Officers, may succeed <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Officers (understand <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> in the second signification before laid down) must needs be confest by our Adversaries themselves, I mean the Presbyterians. They affirm, and believe that they succeed the Apostles in the Office of Ministring in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Ordaining, Governing, and exercising the Discipline of the Church. With what Front then can any of 'em deny, that <hi>Ordinary</hi> Officers (and such at this day are they at the best) may succeed <hi>Extraordinary</hi> ones, in the exercise of an <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Office? Or with what Colour can they pretend, that <hi>fixt</hi> Officers (such are they themselves now, as they believe) cannot succeed those who were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt,</hi> that is the Apostles? So that these Quirks of <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> and <hi>unsettled</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers are devis'd merely to disguise the Truth, and gull the simple Part of Mankind into Schism and Errour.</p>

In after Ages it by degrees came to signify Bishops, at least principally them, and so (as I reckon) it is taken in this Sense, in the <hi>Ember-Weeks</hi> Prayer, <hi>Bishops and Pastors,</hi> there signifying the same Church-Officers. I say perhaps: for tho' I will not assuredly affirm, that by <hi>Pastors</hi> in that Collect, is meant the Presbyters, who assist at Ordinations, and examine the Candidates for Orders, and lay on hands with the Bishop: yet the Prayer is capable of that Sense; <hi>The Bishops and Pastors,</hi> that is, <hi>The Bishops and the Assisting Presbyters.</hi> But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> adds, <q>If the Rector says, they are both Pastors and Evangelists, he confounds those Officers, which the Apostle distinguisheth.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> If what I said just now be not — a sufficient Reply hereunto, I add, that one and the same Person may have distinct Offices, and the distinct Titles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to those Offices. <hi>John</hi> was an Apostle and an Evangelist. Every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle was a Prophet, was an Evangelist, was a Pastor and Teacher. <gap reason="foreign">

Nor is this a Confounding the Officers, because the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not convertible.

               <p>THE Principal Matter whereof may be reduced unto Four Heads.</p>

                  <item>2. What will fall in my way, when I Reply farther unto the <hi>Plea,</hi> which I reserve to a more convenient Place, the second part of this Book.</item>

               <p>In Vindicating the <hi>Politie</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I asserted in <hi>T. N.</hi> That the Parish Priests have a share of Power in the Ecclesiastical Government; for as much as all the Canons, or Laws of the Church are made by them, with their knowledge and consent in Convocation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O. The Acts of Convocation are no Laws, till they be confirmed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 151.</note> 
                  <hi>in Parliameut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> They are, though not Civil, yet Ecclesiastical Laws, and formerly at east obliged in Conscience, as the late Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> informs me, Ecclesiastical Cases <hi>p.</hi> 336. 372, 373. 'Tis nothing to me, whether in Convocation they be made Laws of the Land; I was speaking of the Laws of the Church. Besides, Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Charge against us was, that all the Power in the Church is in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Hands. But this Argument of his Excludes not only the Presbyters, but the Bishops also from having any Power in the Ecclesiastical Legislative. For 'tis likewise true that the Decrees of Convocation, tho' they were made by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops <hi>only,</hi> as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would insinuate, yet would not be Laws of the Land till confirmed by Parliament. Thus the Minister by denying or questioning too much has destroyed the Subject of the Question, the Bishops also being hereby strip'd of their Power, as well as the Presbyters. 'Tis then to no purpose for us to dispute whether the Bishops have all the Ecclesiastical Power in their hands, or whether the Presbyters have some, since according to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> neither of 'em have any.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O. Has every Parish Priest a Power of making Church Laws?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 152.</note> 
                  <hi>If not,</hi> &amp;c. <q>He thinks — they have not, and argues, That if the Parish Priests make Laws by their Representatives, and shall therefore be thought to have Power of Discipline, it will follow, that Free-holders have Power of Government, their Representatives in Parliament, being concerned in the making Laws.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Rector asserts not that <hi>Every Parish Priest has a Power of making Church Laws.</hi> It were an unreasonable thing. But every Parish Priest has a share in the Power of making Ecclesiastical Laws, which he executes by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative in Convocation: and I add, <hi>Every Free-holder has a share of Power
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30465:41"/>
in making the Political-Laws.</hi> But all this is Trifling. Nothing is more evident than this, what is done by a Representative is the Act and Deed of the Persons represented. And nothing is more Ordinary, than to tell discontented People, when the Laws are executed upon them, that <hi>they are of their own making,</hi> that is made by their Representatives.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O. The Convocation is not a just Representative of the Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There are two things only (that I know of) necessary to make a just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Representers be sufficient as to Number.</item>
                  <item>2. That they be freely chosen by the Represented. On both accounts I will prove that the Convocation is a just Representative of the Clergy.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. One cannot from the reason of the thing gather with any certainty, what number of Representers is necessary to make <hi>a just</hi> Representative, and 'twould be in vain to all edge the private Sentiments of Men, among whom it will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be found <hi>quot homines tot sententiae,</hi> so many Men, so many Minds. The surest way then to determine this Point is (I think) to compare the Convocation with the House of Commons, which is the Representative of People. My Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies thus — <q>If the House of Commons be a just Representative of the People, as to the number of the Representers, which no Body, I presume, will dare to deny, then the Convocation is a just Representative of the Clergy.</q> Let us then compare the number of the <hi>Representers</hi> and the <hi>Represented</hi> in the House of Commons with the number of the <hi>Representers,</hi> and <hi>Represented</hi> in the House of Convocation.</p>
               <p>The People of <hi>England</hi> represented in Parliament, are according to Dr. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain'</hi>s computation in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Angliae,</hi> between five and six Millions: Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenters in the House of Commons about five hundred. The Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> are, I reckon, about fifteen Thousand (allowing ten Thousand for the Parsons, Rectors, and Vicars of so many Parishes, and adding to these the Masters and Fellows of the Colledges in both Universities, Chaplains, Lecturers, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, which will in all amount to five Thousand more) as I will grant, because I will not favour a side; tho' it may be they'll not reach above one Third part of that Number. The Representers of these fifteen Thousand in Convocation, are an hundred Sixty and Six, which make up the two lower Houses of Convocation in both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Any Man may hence discern at first sight, the disproportion between five hundred Members of the House of Commons, Representing above five Millions of People. And one Hundred Sixty and Six Members of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion representing only fifteen Thousand Clergy. Every Parliament Man (let us now consider them <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>) represents about ten Thousand Persons: But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Member of Convocation represents not much above Ninety. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference then is as Ninety to ten Thousand. If then the Members of the House of Commons are in respect of number, a just Representative of the People (as we all believe) much more are the Members of Convocation, a just Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Now because the Wisdom and Integrity of Representers is to be regarded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as well as their Number, and because their Wisdom and Integrity, cannot be better judged of, than by considering the freedom of their choice, we are in the next place to enquire whether the Members of Convocation are not as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chosen by the Clergy, as the Members of Parliament are by the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:30465:42"/>Let it then be remembred that a great part of the Nation, have not any Voice at all in the Election of Members of Parliament: For (we know) a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Servants, Labourers, Mechanicks, Shop-keepers, Merchants, Artists of all sorts. Scholars, Attorneys, Lawyers, Physicians, Divines (not having Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Estates) Copy-holders, Minors also, and single Women have no Voice in the Election of any Parliament Man: That is (as I reckon) four parts of five of the People are not at all admitted to chuse Parliament Men. But all the Parsons, Rectors and Vicars, have Suffrages in the Election of Members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, and these Electors are two Thirds of the Clergy, <hi>viz.</hi> Parsons, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Vicars, being ten Thousand by my former Calculation. It appears hence, that if the House of Commons is a just Representative of the People with respect to their Election, much more is the Convocation a just Representative of the Clergy: four fifths of the People, as I reckon, being intirely excluded from choosing Members of Parliament, and but one Third part of the Clergy from choosing Members of Convocation.</p>
               <p>But to evince this, and make it yet more plain, we must go another way to work, because of the various methods, whereby Persons by Ancient Custom, or Constitution become Members of Parliament, and of Convocation without any due Election.</p>
               <p>Of the five hundred Members of the House of Commons, one hundred are <hi>Knights,</hi> chosen only by Free-holders, who are not haply an eighth part of the People of <hi>England;</hi> and the other four hundred are <hi>Citizens, Burgesses and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Cinque Ports,</hi> Elected by an handful of Men, who are not (I believe) a fiftyeth part of the People of <hi>England.</hi> And these latter, in respect of the Body of the Nation, I can scarce admit to be <hi>elected;</hi> they may more fitly be said to come in by Privilege. Of the one hundred Sixty and Six Members of Convocation, about fifty two, or a third part are chosen Proctors, by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Vicars and Rectors, who are two thirds of the Clergy; about an hundred and fourteen, come in by vertue of their Dignities (as Deans and Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons) or by the Election of the Chapters only. Let any one then judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the lower Houses of Convocation, are near so much cramp'd with Members by Privilege, as the House of Commons is: four parts of the House of Commons, being chosen by not a fiftieth part of the Pople, and the fifth part of'em, by about an eighth part of the People; But a third part of the Convocation is chosen by two thirds of the Clergy, and the rest by privilege. If then the House of Commons, notwithstanding what has been observed, are by all Wise Men look'd upon as a just Representative of the People, with respect unto their choice, as well as their number, I would know a Reason, why the Convocation is not a just Representative of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>Now least what has been said shall not be thought clear enough, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to evince what it is intended for, there being a great uncertainty in such Calculations, I shall compare the Convocation with the Assembly of Divines at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who (if I am not much mistaken) will be found on both the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Accounts, that is of Number, and of Choice to have been not so just a Representative of the Clergy, as the Convocation is. This will be dispatched in a very few Words.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1643. the Parliament called that <hi>Assembly,</hi> consisting of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty and two Persons: Of whom let it be noted,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:30465:42"/>1. That they fell short of the two Houses of Convocation, forty four in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, besides, that there were some <hi>Scots</hi> among'em.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That not one of'em was chosen by the Clergy, but all Nominated by the Parliament. Either then let Mr. <hi>O.</hi> give over taxing the Convocation, as if it were not a <hi>just Representative</hi> of the Clergy, or confess the <hi>Westminster Assembly,</hi> to have been packed to serve a Turn, contrary to all Law and Justice. In short, and to retort Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Reflections, the Assemby of Divines, were all of 'em (except a few Nominated for a Colour) the Parliaments <hi>Creatures, chosen by them alone.</hi> The rest, if they had joined in the <hi>Westminster</hi> Deliberations, had been <hi>meer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>:</hi> there were <hi>enough to out-vote 'em,</hi> besides, those Lords and Commoners, who were taken into the Assembly, like so many Lay-Elders to <hi>Influence</hi> their Counsels, and prevent any Decree that might be offered contrary to that Parliaments Inclinations or Designs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>If the Rector can find no proof in Scripture, that<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 153.</note> Ordinary Presbyters did suspend at all, how dare they (the Episcopal-Clergy) do it for a Fortnight? If Presbyters may by Scripture suspend, how dares the Rector condemn the Dissenting Ministers for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We suspend not by virtue of our own sole inherent Power, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with our Diocesan, with his knowledge and consent. There is a great Difference between an Inherent Power for Presbyters to suspend (a precedent for which I require out of Scripture) and to suspend for a time, according to the Constitutions of the Church, and in Subordination to the Bishop, unto whom the Party Suspended may appeal.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> Whereas I affirmed, that the Ordinary Elders had<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 156.</note> not Supreme Authority in the Churches, at least not after <hi>Paul'</hi>s return from <hi>Italy</hi> in the East, the Minister inferrs, that, <hi>herein is imply'd, that Ordinary Presbyters had the Supreme Authority before that time, and Challenges the Rector to prove they were ever deprived of it afterward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no such thing imply'd by the Rector, but only supposed at most, to avoid all unnecessary Disputes with his Adversaries. But if it were out of question, that the Ordinary Elders had once the Supreme Authority, yet the Apostle committing afterward the Supreme Authority, unto single Persons, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and making no mention at all of the Ordinary Presbyters, must be understood to supersede the Power, that was before in the Presbyters, and to subject them unto those single Persons for the future. But this is the Point in Controversy throughout these Papers, and needs not here to be insisted on.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O. Here the Rector fairly confesses there were no Bishops,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Rector supposes it only, as is said before, but does not grant it. Nay, he is quite of another mind. But it sufficeth to his Hypothesis, that single Persons were (afterward at least) Constituted Rulers (Bishops) in the Churches.</p>

Presbyters therefore did not by their own sole Power Ordain, but in Conjunction with the Apostle. On the other hand, if the <hi>Revelation</hi> concerning <hi>Timothy'</hi>s Ordination, came to the Presbyters, as well as to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they then acted not as <hi>Ordinary</hi>

                  </gap>, it no where appears that <hi>Paul</hi> joined the Presbyters in Commission with <hi>Timothy,</hi> it may then be reasonable to conclude, that <hi>Timothy</hi> received the <hi>sole</hi> Power, though 'tis sufficient for me to say, He had the <hi>Supreme.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Be it so: yet still if <hi>Barnabas</hi> was an Apostle as well as <hi>Paul</hi> (as is manifest from <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 4, 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 29.) And if <hi>Barnabas</hi> was equal to <hi>Paul,</hi> as many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will not deny, then we are but where we were before. This is nothing to Ordinary Elders Ordaining. That <hi>Barnabas</hi> was tho' not equal to <hi>Paul,</hi> yet independent on him, may be probably hence gathered that in the sharp Contest between'em, <hi>Barnabas</hi> submitted not to <hi>Paul</hi> but separated from him, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 39. Besides, <hi>Barnabas</hi> received the same Commission that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, and at the same time, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1, 2.

                  </gap>, yet Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will not (I hope) deny he was more than an Ordinary Elder, what then is this to Ordinary Elders Ordaining, by their own sole Power, and inherent Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?

               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>A great part of <hi>T. N.</hi> is to prove, That Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 165.</note> were not Supreme Governours, because the Apostles were above'em: And yet that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Supreme Governours, though the Apostles were above them also. Either the Elders were Supreme Governours, or <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:30465:44"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I shew'd by Induction of Particulars, that the Presbyters were subject unto the Apostles in every <hi>single Act</hi> of Government: That either an Apostle or a Prophet, was constantly at the Helm to guide and direct 'em. The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had not a discretionary Power in any Case, that we read of. But <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> (though they also were subject to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whenever he thought fit to interpose, yet) generally speaking were left unto the Judgment of their own private Discretion, as appears from the Rules of Government prescribed 'em by the Apostle. There is a manifest difference between <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> their subjection to the Apostle, and that of the Ordinary Elders: <hi>See the Preface.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> Whereas in proof of many Congregations in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> I cited <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 10. <hi>All they which dwelt in</hi> Asia <hi>heard the Word of the Lord Jesus.</hi> And backed this with <hi>Ignatius'</hi>s calling himself the Bishop of <hi>Syria,</hi> not of <hi>Antioch</hi> only, but of some considerable part of the adjacent Country. The Minister Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>This is little to the purpose, and that Men will talk any thing.</hi> But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Do not these Observations render it highly probable, that the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Church was also composed of several Assembles in City and Country? And is not this a good account why a Bishop, and many Presbyters, and Deacons were employ'd in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> not serving one Congregation alone in the City, but others also in the Country round about called <hi>Asia?</hi> If there had been but one Congregation at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> one Bishop, or Presbyter might have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed. The Christians at that time of day were not so wealthy, as to multiply Church-Officers more than needed. This is not (I confess) to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Purpose, but I hope 'twill be thought to mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> further pleads <q>That the Rector (<hi>understand in Order to prove there were many Congregations in that Church</hi>) <hi>May as well say, that the Church of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>took in the</hi> Parthians, <hi>and dwellers in</hi> Mesopotamia, Cappadocia, <hi>&amp;c. for all these heard the Word of the Lord Jesus.</hi> Acts 2. 9, 11. as well as those of <hi>Asia</hi> did.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That's the thing which I do affirm. The <hi>Parthians,</hi> and Dwellers in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> here mentioned, belonged unto the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so many of 'em, as were converted. For the <hi>Dwellers</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> v. 9. are said to be <hi>Dwellers</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem, v.</hi> 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the word in both places. Now if they Dwelt at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> can it be doubted, whether they belong'd to that Church? The Difficulty is, how the same Persons should be called <hi>Dwellers</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> at the same time. To this I answer, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is as much concerned as I am to give an account of the Difficulty. Nevertheless I'll venture to shoot my Bolt for once, leaving every Man Liberty to judge of it, as he sees cause.</p>
               <p>I am not satisfy'd with their Opinion, who say that these <hi>Dwellers</hi> in <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> &amp;c. came up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> only for a time, to observe the Feast of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost.</hi> How then could they be called <hi>Dwellers at Jerusalem?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Mede B. 1. <hi>Disc.</hi> 20th being of this Opinion expounds <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>a short stay,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 9th <hi>a durable Mansion,</hi> supporting his Exposition by <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 44. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 20. But 'tis not likely, <hi>Luke</hi> would use the same Word, in the same Period, in so different Senses, and so perplex his Reader. I reckon then that many Jews, who formerly dwelt in <hi>Mesopotamia, and were born there,</hi> v. 8. had now shifted their Dwellings, and resided at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> They
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30465:44"/>
who had before dwelt in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> did now dwell at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as some think of the Messiah, and by consequence the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> might take in the Dwellers in <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> And what is said here of the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> must be apply'd unto the <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docians,</hi> &amp;c. More particularly, I thus explain it. There were at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> many Schools or Colleges, for the Education and Instruction of Youth in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. These Colleges were built at the Charge of such Jews as lived in Foreign Countries, and sent their Youth to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to be brought up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their Law. Their Tutors or Instructors, were probably Natives of the same Countries. All these being born in Foreign Nations, and therefore called <hi>Dwellers in them,</hi> are nevertheless reckoned as at this time <hi>Dwellers in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where they now resided, and so being Converted, might become Members of the new Christian Church at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But this is a Matter of little moment in the present Controversy.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>If the Power of conferring other Powers, is greater than those other Powers, then Bishops, who make an Archbishop are greater than he is: and so are Bishops than Kings who they Crown, as also Recorders or Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Clerks, than Majors, whom they Swear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I know very well that my Proposition is liable to several exceptions, which it is not worth while to trouble the Reader with. Its certain, that when a free People, Superior to the Candidate, elect themselves a King, they are become subject to him, not greater than he is: And that because they divest themselves of the Power, which they put into the hands of another. The Case is the same, when Bishops make an Archbishop. They subject themselves to him, and thence-forward, he is their Superior. But this is not the Case before us. He who is possest of a Power, and is able also to conferr the same Power upon another, not diminishing nor destroying his own Power, must needs be greater than he who receives that Power, but is not able to give it to another. A Bishop (as my supposition is) having Power to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in the Word and Sacraments, is also enabled to confer this Ministry upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that is to Ordain Presbyters, and yet deprives not himself of it. He still Ministers in the Word and Sacraments himself. But he is greater thàn a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because the Presbyter, though he has received the Power of Ministring in the Word and Sacraments, yet he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Ordain another unto that Office, as the Bishop can. Nothing needs be plainer. But I will illustrate it by a known Instance. There are twenty four Knights of the Garter, the King is one of them. Every Knight of the Garter, cannot create a Fellow of the Order, but the Sovereign only. For which Reason He is called the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the other Companions of the Order are, I mean <hi>quatenus</hi> the <hi>Sovereign Knight.</hi> And therefore he is greater than the rest; because he is not only a Knight of the Garter, but can make one, I need not apply it.</p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s other Instances, they are but so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Mistakes. It's the Hereditary Title or Election, which makes the King, and not he who is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to manage the publick Ceremony, of setting the Crown on the King's Head, and giving him the Oath. And Mayors, are made by the Election of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Men of the Corporation, and not by the Town-Clerks or Recorders, who Swear them.</p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> This is nothing to the Argument before us: this is no Scripture proof, that Presbyters ever Excommunicated, or suspended. And though I will not take upon me to defend or palliate any unwarrantable Practice; yet I am of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that some Corrupt Administrations, are not a sufficient reason for destroying Governments, either Civil, or Ecclesiastical: for then an end must be put unto all Government whatever. Nor do I believe one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>-Administration can excuse another: I mean Recrimination is no just Defence. Nevertheless against my Inclination, yea, and my Resolution too, I'll for once walk a little out of my way, and tell Mr. <hi>O.</hi> a story, by the bye, to the end he may not be too much conceited of the Integrity and Innocence of his own Party; but may thence see the Corruption of Humane Nature, and be convinced that Presbyterians are not so sweet as some would have 'em thought to be; but when 'tis in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they also can be willing to <hi>Commute,</hi> as well as other People.</p>

                     <q>The second Presbyterian Class, in the Province of <hi>Lancaster</hi> (as 'twas called) began at <hi>Bury, March</hi> 25. 1647.

                  <p>Now the occasion of this Elegant and spruce Questionis this. The Rector in <hi>T.

But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> belike has chop'd upon something to that purpose, as he thought in the <hi>Rhemish</hi> Testament, for which cause I am here compared to a Blind Tit. 'Tis confest (though there's no need to confess it, as will appear presently) I was not aware of that Passage of the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> and I am certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Pearson</hi> makes no mention of 'em, or of any other Author, which drew me into this mistake, if it will prove one at last; but what if it should? It does not in the least affect me, that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find me once in an Errour. I pretend not to be infallible or Omniscient. I have somewhat a better Proverb to excuse my self with, than Mr. <hi>O.</hi> had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile me. <hi>Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.</hi> The good Old Man <hi>Homer</hi> himself, was not only blind, but asleep too sometimes. Nor would I trouble my self to make more Words on this slight Occasion, were it not that I think my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to vindicate Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> least any one should surmise, that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the <hi>Rhemists</hi> for his New Chronology, about the time when <hi>Paul</hi> besought <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and yet had not the Ingenuity to acknowledge it. Let us then in the first place produce the <hi>Rhemists</hi> Words, which are as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:30465:46"/>
                     <q>This Epistle was written, as it seems after <hi>Paul'</hi>s first<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rhemish</hi> Argument before the first Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                        </note> Imprisonment in <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was dismissed and set at Liberty, and thereupon it is, that he might say here, <hi>I hope to come to thee quickly</hi> (1 Tim. 3. 14) <hi>That's to say at Ephesus,</hi> where he had desired him to remain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> But though the <hi>Rhemists</hi> here stumbled upon a small part of the Truth, they offer'd nothing in Confirmation of it, neither in the Argument, nor in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations upon the Epistle it self. Nor (which is to be noted) did they in the least make use of their Opinion in proof of Episcopacy: But Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> did both, without being beholden to the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> for one Syllable towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment of this New Chronology.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> speak only of the Time of <hi>Paul'</hi>s writing this Epistle, not of his Beseeching <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> at his going into <hi>Macedonia:</hi> concerning which they have not given the least intimation, but left that part of the Old Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology as they found it. Only they seem to think that <hi>Paul,</hi> having long before his Imprisonment besought <hi>Timothy</hi> to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> did now, after he was Dismissed and set at Liberty, <hi>viz.</hi> about the time that he wrote to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his Enlargement, send this Letter unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> which is an Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis quite different from that of Bishop <hi>Pearson'</hi>s, as any one that understands, and remembers what has already been offered upon the Argument, will readily confess. So that the Learned Prelate was not in the least beholden unto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> for the Discovery and proof of this New Chronology, <hi>the Time of</hi> Paul'<hi>s beseeching</hi> Timothy <hi>to abide at</hi> Ephesus.</p>
                  <p>There was then little Occasion for Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s challenging me with <hi>Boldness,</hi> and giving me that undeserv'd Character — <hi>That when I am remotest from Truth I am then most consident.</hi> I leave it to my Adversaries themselves, the Dissenters, to determine, which of the two is in the point of Time now debated, guilty of most Confidence. Well, but</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>O. Thought of this Argument before the Rector published it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Haply so, but the Question is, whether he ever thought of it before Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> brought it to Light. And if he has been so long acquainted with it, as he would have us think, or has prepared a <hi>Dissertation</hi> to vindicate the Old Chronology, as he boasts, I hope 'twill be better put together than his <hi>Defence,</hi> and that one time or other, we shall be blest with a sight of so Elaborate a piece of Work: in the mean while, I am of Opinion, that if Mr. <hi>O.</hi> had been so long acquainted with this New Chronology, and had prepared a Dissertation to vindicate the Old one, his <hi>Defence</hi> would have been more tight and correct, than I find it; His <hi>Plea,</hi> would have had something in it surely, relating to this New Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. In fine, that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> thought of the Bishop's Argument, before the Rector's Book came forth, is not material; but that He thought of it before the Rector proposed it to him, we have only his own Word for it, which is not much worth in this case of Self-Testimony; Yea, granting this also, I have good reason to believe he derived this part of his knowledge from Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> for a Reason best known to my self.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has wonderfully demonstrated, from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 9. 21.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 163.</note> That <hi>Paul</hi> sent for <hi>Timothy</hi> to him at <hi>Rome,</hi> what no Body ever deny'd; and yet he has not hereby proved, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ever in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's Company, after he was besought to abide at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> 'Tis not out of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30465:46"/>
doubt to me that <hi>Timothy</hi> saw <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> though he sent for him. For not to speak of other Obstacles, <hi>Paul</hi> might have been Martyred by the Emperor's Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and sudden Command, before <hi>Timothy</hi> reached <hi>Rome.</hi> This is very likely, if we consider the State of Affairs at <hi>Rome</hi> about that time, as we read 'em set forth in the <hi>Annals of Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I excepted against in Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> was not that which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> pretends to make Answer to, but that he asserted <hi>Equals could receive Accusations as</hi> Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy did. This the <hi>Dr.</hi> proved (if Mr <hi>Prinn</hi> wrongs him not) from a Synod of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who received an Accusation against one of their own Number, and then Censured him for his Fault. Now how far this is from a proof of what it was alledged for, I shewed at large, and Mr. <hi>O.</hi> who Taxes me for so doing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks it, nor makes any Reply to it. Indeed it is not to be Answered if it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> true, as I think none will deny, that one Bishop is not equal, but Inferior and Subject to a Synod of Bishops. Therefore a Synod's receiving an Accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Bishop, is no proof of the Doctor's Assertion, but an Instance of the contrary.</p>
                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s own examples out of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> were they never so convincing (which shall in its place be considered) they will not however Vindicate Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> nor are a proper Answer to my Exceptions against him.</p>
                  <p>The proportion of Dioceses, how large at most they ought to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 166.</note> be, is not my business to determine, as I undertake not to define how big a Parish or Congregation ought to be. I suppose the <hi>ultimum quod sic,</hi> and the Limits <hi>quos ultra citraque nequit consistere Rectum,</hi> are in both uncertain: and are only to be adjusted <hi>prout viri prudentes definiverint,</hi> as Superiors shall think fit to Order, and not by the Caprice and humoursome phancy of every overweening Opinionanist, and self conceited Reformer.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>O. hears the Rectors Parish has four or five Chappels in it.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Rectors Parish has neither five nor four Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels in it. Tho' the Ministers Ears be never so long, yet is he mistaken herein. If it had twenty, 'tis nothing to the purpose.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> Because the Rector affirm'd it no more impossible for<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Timothy</hi> (supposed then the Angel of the Chruch of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.) <hi>To leave his first Love,</hi> than for <hi>Judas</hi> to betray his Master, is mightily disturbed, and to confute it musters up many Commendations given of <hi>Timothy</hi> in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In <hi>T. N.</hi> I declared my Opinion plainly, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel there spoken of: yet supposing it, 'twas not impossible for <hi>Timothy</hi> to be guilty of some Defection. The Commendations alone render it not impossible. Abstracting from Matter of Fact then, that <hi>Judas</hi> an Apostle, who had the Power of Casting out Devils, should turn Apostate, is as strange, as that <hi>Timothy</hi> should leave his first Love. Lastly, when 'tis for his turn, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> can admit, that <hi>Timothy</hi> might be overtaken with <hi>Youthful Lusts,</hi> but when he wants an Occasion of Cavilling, then 'tis monstrous horrid to suppose it possible for <hi>Timothy</hi> to be guilty of some Defection from the Truth. If the one was possible, why not the other? But especially if the <gap reason="foreign">

Signifie the Lusts of the Mind, its proneness to Paradoxes, to New up-start Opinions, curious Conceipts, and Innovations in Religion, of which kind we reckon Presbytery and Independency, which are but of Yesterday, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

                  <p>I have now done with Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s <hi>Defence.</hi> If I have left any thing of Moment unanswered; Or if I have failed giving full satisfaction to any Material Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Objected against me, I do promise either to supply these Defects, or fairly to confess my self unable.

               <p>HAving spoken of the Government of the Christian Church in General, and as far as the Holy Scriptures afford us any Light: Having thence shewn that meer Presbyters alone did never exercise any Supreme Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of any kind that can be there discovered, except in Conjunction with, and subordination to some extraordinary Officers as Apostles or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: Having in particular traced the manner of Government at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> unto the Death of St. <hi>John</hi> the Apostle; and the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and found it cast by St. <hi>Paul</hi> into the same Form, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> is at this Day, <hi>viz.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of three distinct Orders of Ministers (the Title only of the Supreme Governours haply excepted) and so continued after him, as I said unto the time of <hi>Ignatius:</hi> And Lastly, having answered all the Objections raised against our Episcopal Government, by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in his Book Entituled <hi>A Plea,</hi> &amp;c. (So many of 'em, I mean, as seemed to carry any weight in them, and concerned the times, within the Compass of which I have confin'd my self hitherto, that's to say, the Apostolical Age.) After all this, it remains that I consider the Arguments, which to the same purpose he was drawn from Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, beginning where the Scripture ends, and so descending unto these last Ages, before which time Episcopacy was never brought into Question for Fifteen Hundred Years, save by one Arch-Heretick <hi>Aërius,</hi> of whom more hereafter.

               <p>THE substance of what Mr. <hi>O.</hi> argues from this Epistle against Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Episcopacy, and in favour of Presbyterian Parity is, whereas I affirm in <hi>T.

               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Clement</hi> no where saith there were those three distinct<note place="margin">

In both which places two only Orders are to be met with; That <hi>Clement</hi> does not intend to affirm there were three kinds of Officers in the Christian Church as in the Mosaical; but only that both the one, and the other Church, (that is the Mosaical with three Orders, and the Christian with two) were both established by the same Divine Authority.</q> Unto all which it's reply'd;</p>
               <p n="1">1. I readily grant <hi>Clement</hi> no where <hi>expresly</hi> affirms there were three distinct Orders in the Christian Church: or that the High-Priests, Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> in the Jewish Church, were the Pattern of Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons in the Christian. Thus much is granted: Nevertheless, what I cited him for may be true, and is so, <hi>sc.</hi> That He <hi>seems to make</hi> the Jewish Government the Pattern of the Christian, as we are wont to argue from him, comparing the one with the other.

               <p n="2">2. As I acknowledge <hi>Clement</hi> did not <hi>totidem verbis</hi> assert the Orders, so I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that though He expresly mentions two only, yet he affirms no where, that there were two only kinds of Officers in the Church of <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. I join issue with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> that <hi>Clement</hi> ought to be expounded by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but surely not by the two places only which he has alledged, all the rest being laid aside. The Epistle then of <hi>Clement</hi> must be Expounded by the Whole Scripture, and what Intimations of three Orders are any where there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be found. This has been done already, and needs not be drawn in here again, to lengthen and confound the Argument. Only thus briefly to the two Passages adduced by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> Though St. <hi>Paul, Philip.</hi> 1. 1. mentions Bishops and Deacons only, and no third Superior Officer in that Church: yet <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 25. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> calls <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> (by whom he sent this Epistle) the Apostle of the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians:</hi> and though 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> He names Bishops and Deacons only, and no third Officer, yet (as I hope has been sufficiently made out) he had constituted <hi>Timothy</hi> Ruler of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and particularly of the Elders there. So that there were at <hi>Philippi</hi> three Orders, an Apostle, Bishops (or Presbyters) and Deacons. Likewise at <hi>Ephesus, Timothy</hi> the Ruler of that Church, and Bishops (or Presbyters) and Deacons: and the same is to be believed of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when <hi>Clement</hi> wrote to 'em, if we will suffer our selves to be guided by Scripture and Reason.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That <hi>Clement</hi> exhorted the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be subject unto the Presbyters, is certain. But so did <hi>Ignatius</hi> require, that the Churches should be subject to their Presbyters, tho' at the same time he urged the Christians, and specially the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters themselves to be subject to the Bishop. The Flock may be subject to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30465:49"/>
Presbyters, and at the same time they and the Presbyters ought to be subject to the Bishop. Again, that the Presbyters governed the Church in common, is not questioned, but that they did so without a Bishop, is no where <hi>expresly</hi> said. Lastly, that <hi>Clement expresly</hi> mentions no Chief Bishop at <hi>

               <p n="6">6. It may deserve our Observation, what <hi>Clement</hi> writes towards the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Epistle, <hi>p.</hi> 69. thus — <q>Whoever among you is Generous and Charitable let him resolve thus, If the Sedition, Contention, and Schisms are risen on my account, I'll be gone where-ever ye will, and whatever the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple require, that I'll do: only let the Flock of Christ, and <hi>the Presbyters</hi> set o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, live in Peace.</q> Methinks the Author in these Words, plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough distinguishes between that <hi>Generous</hi> Person first spoken of, and a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of the Presbyters immediately after mentioned separately from him. This <hi>Generous</hi> Person was it seems settled in some Post or Office, by one Party of the <hi>

Now what Office could this be, but that of the Prelatical Bishop? He could not be a meer Presbyter, for he's plainly distinguished from them. And besides, 'tis not to be imagined that one common Presbyter, equal with the Rest, should have been the occasion of such a dangerous Schism, or that his Absence should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put an end to it, as 'tis here imply'd. Nor will any one (I believe) say, that He was a Deacon, much less an Ordinary Believer. He was then (as I conceive) the Prelate of that Church: but not acceptable to one party of the <hi>

In further proof of this, I offer unto Consideration, what I long since wrote in my <hi>Clement</hi> upon the Margin, but was not so happy as to refer to the Author whence I had taken that Note; 'Tis this, <q>That from the Passage of <hi>Clement'</hi>s Epistle just before set down at length <hi>

But, <hi>Blundel</hi> (and his Followers, I remember) to reconcile unto their own Hypothesis, the different way of the Fathers reckoning up the Ministerial Orders of the Christian Church, asserts, that sometimes they conform their Language to the Scripture and Apostolical Age: At other times to their own Customs, and the Ecclesiastical Constitutions. In the former case they use the Dichotomy mentioning only Presbyters (or Bishops) and Deacons: in the latter they divide 'em into three Ranks, Bishops, and Priests, and Deacons. But this device will not do their Work, and must be laid aside, for the following Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

He begins it thus — <hi>Our Lord, whose precepts we ought to Reverence, and Observe, establishing the Honour of the Bishop and the Churches affairs, says,</hi> &amp;c. And again he adds — <hi>Hence the Ordination of Bishops and the Affairs of the Church, pass through the course of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If then Bishops were by Divine Right in the Judgment of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he must speak in the Language of the Apostolical Age, where the Divine Right ends, as well as his own, when he reckons up the three distinct Orders of Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons. But of this see more in <hi>Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well'</hi>s 10th <hi>Cypr.</hi> Dissertation. Nor can these <hi>Praepositi</hi> and <hi>Episcopi,</hi> be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Presbyters: for <hi>Cyp.</hi> (whatever any may fancy of <hi>Praepositi</hi>) never calls Presbyters, Bishops; Nor could he conformably to his own Writings.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Optatus</hi> in the same Breath, in one short Period expresses himself both ways, as well in the Bipartite, as in the Tripartite Form. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must surely be understood to respect one and the same Age in the same Sentence. If he had therein an Eye unto the Apostolical Age, <hi>Blundel'</hi>s Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of no Advantage to our Adversaries. Still upon that supposition, there were three Orders in the Apostles time: If He referred to his own Age, then although He comprehends 'em in two Words, yet was there three Orders of Ministers in the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ignatius</hi> can with no Colour of reason be supposed to look to any other than the Apostolical Age, wherein he lived a great while, and was Martyr'd but about ten Years after the Apostle St. <hi>John.</hi> His three Orders therefore Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, were not, strictly speaking, of Ecclesiastical,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30465:51"/>
but Apostolical Constitution. By consequence <hi>Blundel'</hi>s device makes nothing for the Identity of Bishops and Presbyters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It no manner of way relieves our Adversaries, from our Argument ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Scriptures, which use the Dichotomy, and in it comprehend the three Jewish Orders, the High-Priests, the second Priests and the <hi>Levites.</hi> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity whereunto the Fathers, may be thought to have summed up the Christian Ministers in two Words also.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, with what Congruity could the Fathers so often fall into this Dichotomy, and yet at the same time believe the three Orders to be by Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Constitution? The Answer is easy. Except the Ruling part, that's to say, the Administration of the Church Government, and Discipline, otherwise the Presbyters were and still are among us, as it were equal to Bishops, <hi>sc.</hi> in the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, wherein they Officiate as effectually as the Bishops themselves: for which Reason they may be accounted the Bishops Peers, and both not unfitly called by one common name. Even as I before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from St. <hi>Chrysoftom,</hi> Presbyters are comprehended in Deacons, as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in some things common to both.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And in the last place that which I insist, and chiefly rely upon, as a just Answer unto the Argument grounded on St. <hi>Clement'</hi>s Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> is this, that 'tis drawn only from a Negative, <hi>Clement'</hi>s not expresly mentioning the three distinct Orders, which I contend is unconcluding. I have oft enough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Instances out of Scripture, of the Apostle's not constantly remembring all the Church-Officers in their Epistles, and frequently mentioning none at all. To keep my self within the Compass of my present Province, the Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whose great Design in all his other Epistles was to assert, and vindicate the three Orders of Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, passes 'em all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But 'tis no good Consequence that therefore the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had not in it so much as a Presbyter or a Deacon. It may farther be considered, that much more an Argument deduced from an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's silence can be of no force, when there are other positive, and express Witnesses attesting the Truth brought into Question. If a Witness deposes, that <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> were engaged in the Murder of <hi>Robert,</hi> this shall not quit <hi>Thomas,</hi> if another Witness swears he also had an hand in the Assassination. <hi>Clement</hi> mentions Bishops (or Presbyters) and Deacons, not so much as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that there was a Prelate at <hi>Corinth</hi> (let that now be supposed:) But his Contemporary <hi>Ignatius,</hi> has again and again testify'd that there were Bishops, Priests and Deacons in several Churches, to which he wrote, and particularly in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that there were these three distinct-Officers, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World as far as he knew, and by consequence at <hi>Corinth;</hi> Though <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for Reasons best known unto himself, thought not fit to mention the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Nor can it with Reason be pleaded, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> was ignorant of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Apostolical Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as I suppose it will be granted. From the whole then I gather that <hi>Clement'</hi>s Silence is no good proof, that there was no Prelatical Bishop at <hi>Corinth,</hi> because his Contemporary is positive there was; which now brings me to the Testimony of <hi>Ignatim</hi> in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would bring the credit of these Epistles into<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Genuineness of these Epistles was never questioned by any Learned Man, that I know of, since Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> published his vindication of 'em, save by Monsieur <hi>La Roque,</hi> who attempted to support Monsieur <hi>Daille</hi> but without success. I never heard he gained any one Proselyte. 'Tis confessed, I have not read that <hi>French</hi> Gentleman's Book, the Reason whereof is, that when Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> was by his Friends dealt with to make a Reply to <hi>La Roque,</hi> the Wise Man answered, <hi>There was no need of it, that</hi> La Roque <hi>had advanced nothing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against his</hi> Vindiciae, <hi>and that the Authority of St.</hi> Ignatius's <hi>Epistles remained still unquestionable.</hi> This I remember very well was the common Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us many Years ago, in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and the Event con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it: no Body now daring to deny them, not the Dissenters themselves, though sometimes in general they would have 'em pass for uncertain. It's not intended hereby to disparage Monsieur <hi>La Roque</hi> in the least. His Misfortune was, that, He undertook the Defence of an ill Cause against a Potent Adversary, in such a Case the Learned'st Man in the World, must be forced to retire with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and disappointment. But for Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to say that, <hi>'Twas not agreed among the Learned,</hi> &amp;c. when one only Learned Man is to be found that stands out, is too much (I think) to offer unto the World, as if the Balance were even, and the Learned equally divided about the Genuineness of <hi>Ignatius'</hi>s Epistles. I am perswaded Mr. <hi>O.</hi> himself believes, what Bishop <hi>Pearson</hi> has proved 'em to be, though he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that they are yet doubtful: But enough of this.</p>

                        <hi>Plea,</hi> p. 29.</note> that the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> consisted of no more Members than could Ordinarily meet in one place, and had but one Altar, at which

Finally (up and down in the <hi>Defence</hi>) that as the Presbyters could do nothing without the Bishops, so neither could the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops without their Presbytery, which is an Argument of their Parity, and that (as elsewhere he, and generally all other <hi>Dissenters</hi> make <hi>Ignatius'</hi>s Bishops) they were but the Moderators in the Presbyteries, and those not for Life nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but temporary only, as many of them have affirmed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Presumptions Mr. <hi>O.</hi> means are those He speaks of in his <hi>Plea</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> as I suppose, grounded upon some slight Passages in the Epistles, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and such like, of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough has already been said, unless their sense could be more certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For He and I may talk and dispute till Dooms-Days, that thus, or thus those Phrases may or ought to signifie, and at last leave the Matter as we found it, undecided, and every Man to choose what sense he pleases, as his Interest sways him, or as his Affections and adherence to a Cause shall Byass him. Letting then these things pass; the Answer which I make, shall be to lay before the Reader some Reasons, as will I hope evince the Truth, and prevail with him, to embrace the sense of this Father, which we have already given, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Bishops were truly Prelatical and Diocesan. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Were it as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> affirms, yet the Dissenters are Universally departed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from this Form of Church Government. What one Congregation among 'em has its Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, and the Bishop the Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager without whom nothing ought to be done? But</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas he tells us, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Bishop was but the chief Pastor of a Church, that is the Moderator of the Presbytery, this cannot be, if we will allow <hi>Ignatius</hi> to have been a Man of common Sense and Understanding. For what more absurd and impertinent, could have been written than all along in these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Epistles, to distinguish so carefully between the Bishop, and his Presbyters, and yet all the while the Bishop, was but one of the Presbyters, set up only to Moderate in their Presbyteries, and debates for Orders sake? Or how could <hi>Ignatius</hi> direct, (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> pleads) that the Presbyters, should do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bishop, nor the Bishop without the Presbyters, except he thought the Bishop a distinct Species of Officer from the Presbyters, and the Presbyters from the Bishop? The Bishop then, and the Presbyter must needs be two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Orders, in <hi>Ignatius'</hi>s Opinion.</p>
               <p>It is objected, that since the Obligation was reciprocal, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Bishop could do nothing without the Presbyters, as the Presbyters could not Act without the Bishop, the Bishop therefore had no preheminence above the Presbyters. I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That however the Bishop must be allowed to have been more than an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Presbyter, yea at least equal to the whole Presbytery, and to have him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self made a distinct Order from it, (the very Reciprocal Obligation here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of necessity implies as much).</p>

Not only so, but as the King is the Supreme Monarch of this Nation, and more than the Lords or Commons, though He can enact no Law without the Parliament, as the Parliament cannot without him; as the King, I say, makes a distinct State of the Realm (this I think Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will grant) so was <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Bishop, an Officer different from the Presbyters (if the Father spake Sense in his Epistle) and Superior to them.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired, wherein could his Supremacy consist? I reply, that after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Laws and Constitutions were resolved on, between the Bishop and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, or whatever was known to have been ordained by the Apostles, he had the care and oversight to see 'em executed, and in matters of greatest moment, he generally was the executor of 'em himself in Person, as the King is in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs of this Nation. For as the King does nothing, that is, makes no New Laws without the Parliament, yet he sees to the Execution of 'em after they are once made, and of all other the ancient Laws of the Realm, and that without the Parliament: so the Bishop though he did nothing, that is made no New Constitutions without the Presbytery, yet 'twas he who had the care of their Execution, and of the more Ancient, and Apostolical Decrees and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. It must necessarily have been so, if <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles carry any Sense in them.</p>
               <p>But perhaps a positive proof of all this will be demanded from me out of the Epistles. To this purpose, then observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What <hi>Ignatius</hi> writes to the <hi>Ephesians — Whom the Master</hi> (Jesus Christ) <hi>sends unto the Administration of his own Houshold</hi> (the Church) <hi>we ought so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as we would receive the Master that sent him. 'Tis then manifest we ought to look upon the Bishop, as we ought to look upon the Lord</hi> (Jesus Christ). Here it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> accounted the Bishop to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. That though <hi>Ignatius</hi> exhorts the Churches to be subject to, and obey the Bishop and the Presbyters also, (And so He does to the Deacons too, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles to the <hi>Trallians, Philadelphians,</hi> and <hi>Smyrneans</hi>): yet he never thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes Obedience to the Presbyters, or the Presbyteries only, or without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Bishop with and before 'em. But he frequently admonishes the Church to obey the Bishop without express mention of the Presbyters.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That though He advises the Church to be subject unto the Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery (and to the Deacons also), yet he never advises them expresly to <hi>do nothing without the Presbyters,</hi> or Presbytery. Besides, Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s saying that the Bishop could do nothing without the Presbyters, is without ground in these Epistles, it being never said, <hi>Do nothing without the Bishop and the Presbytery,</hi> much less simply, <hi>Do nothing without the Presbyters.</hi>

Here by the way, the conceit of a temporary Moderator, must be thrown out of Doors. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was Bishop of, <hi>Syria</hi> for life: nor could they have another whilst He was living, tho' absent in Bonds. This was the Reason, he so Passionately resented the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of that Church of <hi>Syria,</hi> that they were forced to be without a Bishop, which they needed not to have been, if another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Ignatius</hi> over and over prescribes, that the Churches should <hi>do nothing without the Bishop,</hi> and not only so in these General Terms, (which haply will be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of his presiding in Presbyteries, and moderating in their Debates for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's sake), but also in particular, <hi>that Marriages should not be Celebrated, the Lord's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Supper should not be administred, nor Baptism given unto.

This shews that <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Bishop, was not only the President in their Synods and Deliberations, but the Supreme Director of the Execution of the Laws, and Rules of the Church, without whose leave the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

'Tis all we desire of the Dissenters, if we might prevail with 'em, that they would not presume to do any thing without the Bishop, and particularly not to Ordain Presbyters. Lastly, Although he often calls the Presbytery the Council of God, and College of the Apostles, yet to keep<note place="margin">Ep. ad Magnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad Trall. &amp; alibi.</note> up the Authority of the Bishop, He then at the same time resembles him unto God himself, or to the Lord Jesus Christ. If then God the Father was Superior to the Apostles, and if Jesus Christ must be confest greater than the Council of the Apostles, so was the Bishop, than the Presbyters or Presbytery, in the Opinion of this Father: and according to the Analogy, and Resemblance in this Author. From the whole 'tis (I hope) clear to a Demonstration, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Bishops, were more than what Mr. <hi>O.</hi> means by <hi>chief Pastor:</hi> or Moderator in their Assembles <hi>pro tempore.</hi> They were Prelatical, and in the nature of their Office Superior to Presbyters. It remains that we shew, they were Diocesan Bishops, that is, had the oversight of more than one Congregation; for this is another Objection Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has raised against our established Diocesan Episcopacy. For Proof hereof let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if there were not in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his time, <hi>de facto Diocesan</hi> Bishops, they were at least formed and designed for such, when ever the multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers should be encreased. It has already been observed, that <hi>Titus</hi> left by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> to Govern that Church, was particularly directed by the Apostle to Ordain Elders in every City, in all, or as many Cities as should afterward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30465:54"/>
receive the Faith, or in Order to convert more of 'em. I gather hence that <hi>Titus</hi> was intended to be the Ruler of all these Congregations. Let Mr. <hi>O.</hi> make him a Bishop, or an Archbishop, 'tis all one to me; he was constituted to be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler over many Cities and Congregations. Thus at least it was (I conceive) in these <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches to whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote, as will hence appear, <hi>viz.</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of these Churches was furnished with a Prelatical Bishop, with Presbyters and Deacons under him. To what purpose else so many Presbyters, and such distinct kinds of Orders? One or two at most might have sufficed 'em at present, especially if it be considered, that the Christians at that time were not in so flourishing a condition, as to be able to maintain so many Church-Officers for one Congregation; nor was there business enough to employ 'em all in the service of that one Congregation. 'Tis then most rational to believe, that so many Presbyters and Deacons, were provided at least for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Conversion of the Infidels, and multiplying them into several Congregations. But if every Congregation, must have had or was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have a Bishop, we should doubtléss have read of Bishops, <hi>ex. gr.</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as well as Presbyters in the Plural. Let us then suppose what is most reasonable to admit, that some at least of these Churches had been in <hi>Ignatius'</hi>s time, multiply'd into several Congregations, yet still there was but one Bishop. I do not remember that ever we read of two Bishops, of any one City in all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, excepting when the Christians of that City were harrassed and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with Schisms and Divisions. Now who can imagin, that no one City in the World, even in <hi>Ignatius'</hi>s time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Witnesseth, <hi>That</hi> Christianity had not only over-run City and Country, but had infected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of every Sex, Age and Order of Men. <hi>Plin. l.</hi> 10. <hi>E.</hi> 97.</note> ever had more Believers in and near it, than did Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Divine Worship in one place? Especially in those times of Persecution, when the Christians skulked, and could not with safety meet in great numbers, nor had Rooms capacious enough, and therefore cantoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into several Meetings. Let any one put all these things together, and impartially weigh them, and he will not easily grant that Paradox, that there was no more than one single Congregation in any City; nor will he make any scruple to believe that <hi>Ignatius'</hi>s Bishop, was at least designed to preside over several Presbyters and Congregations. Lastly, the Negative that there was but one Congregation in any of 'em has not been proved, neither can by any express Testimony. I conćeive it behoves our Dissenters, to make this out before they can throughly justifie their Congregational Churches. But let us now come to particulars, and therefore.</p>

               <p n="3">3. I reckon also that the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> consisted of more than one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and my Reasons are</p>
               <p n="1">1. As I argued in <hi>T. N.</hi> p. 145. from <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 10. That the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> took in all <hi>Asia — All they of</hi> Asia <hi>heard the Word of the Lord Jesus,</hi> from the mouth of <hi>Paul,</hi> who then resided at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and there Preached the Gospel first in the Synagogue (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) then in the School of <hi>Tyrannus</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 9.). <hi>Asia,</hi> I expounded <hi>Asia</hi> the Proper: but I would crave leave a little to mend that Gloss, understanding it only of some of the nearer parts of it, adjoining unto <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which belonged ùnto <hi>Asia</hi> the Proper. And wheras the Historian expresses Himself thus largely <hi>all Asia,</hi> and yet intends (as I suppose only the Neigbhouring parts of it, we need not much admire at this, since it is so said to aggrandize and Magnify the success, and Increase of the Gospel. We have an Instance of this kind of expression in the Chapter before us, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 27. where the mad and superstitious People of <hi>Ephesus</hi> Glory of their Goddess <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, that all</hi> Asia, <hi>and the World Worshippeth Her:</hi> and yet, <hi>v.</hi> 34. she is called <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of the <hi>Ephesians:</hi> at least she was not Worshipped all the World over strictly speaking. So I read <hi>Jo.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>Behold the World is gone after him;</hi> and yet only some Numbers of the Jews followed Christ. In short, by <hi>all Asia,</hi> is to be understood the <hi>Ephesian Asia,</hi> or that part which adjoined pretty close unto <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whither their secular business oft drew the Country People: Their Curiosity first lead them unto the Synagogue and School of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> and so they became Acquainted with the Word of the Lord Jesus and embraced it, of these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Converts we read in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 31. — <hi>And certain of the chief of</hi> Asia, <hi>which were his Friends sent unto him,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is it an unusual thing to call the parts of a Country, near unto the Principal City by the general Name of the Province, whereof it is but a little Member. Thus (as is before observed) <hi>Ignatius</hi> stiles Himself Bishop of <hi>Syria;</hi> not of all <hi>Syria,</hi> properly so called, as will I hope be granted me, but of the Country round about <hi>Antioch,</hi> which was within the limits of <hi>Syria.</hi> So then if all they which dwelt in <hi>Asia,</hi> in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as well as in the City its self, heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and this within the space of those two Years, the Apostle remained at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> it must be allowed that the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was too numerous to be contained within one Single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; and it is reasonable to believe, that there were some Congregations in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

If it be doubted whether these Country Proselytes, or these Country Congregations, were Members of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> some Reasons or Evidences to the contrary must be assigned.

But that the Country Presbyters and Congregations within the foresaid Tract, did belong unto <hi>Ephesus</hi> is most probable hence, that the Scripture all along speaks of the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> and of <hi>Asia,</hi> as one and the same Church: <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 18. <hi>Ye know</hi> (says He to the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders) <hi>after what manner I have been with you from the first day, that I came into</hi> Asia.

But thus much I repeat again, they were intended to be cast into the same Model as <hi>Ephefus</hi> was, as many be gathered from the Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons fixt in them, which was, as I may say, the Foundation of larger Churches to consist of many Congregations, after more believers, should by the Grace of God, be added unto the Churches.</p>
               <p>By this time (I am in some Hopes) 'tis undeniably proved, 1. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of those Churches, to whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> wrote, were Prelatical, that is, were of a Distinct species of Church-Officers, and Superior to the Presbyters, who were subject to them. 2. That they were likewise Diocesan, that is, Rulers over several Congregations, and over the Presbyters and Deacons, who Ordinarily Ministred in them, from whence it must be concluded that the several Passages, of whose Sense Mr. <hi>O.</hi> and I have disputed, must be so expounded as to be made agreeable to Prelatical and Diocesan Episcopacy. Whether I have done it, is left to the Judgment of the Reader, if He please to consult the <hi>T. N.</hi> To speak only of the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> No more have we at this day. Though we have many Churches in a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, yet every Church has an Altar, and but one: and so it might be at <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> for any thing that is yet said to the contrary. But</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> goes on — <q>It should seem they had but one Altar to a Church, taking Church for the Company or Corporation, of the Faithful United un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Bishop, in the City or place where the Bishop had his See or Residence; as the Jews had one Temple, and one Altar for the Whole Nation, United under one High-Priest.</q> The Author endeavours to confirm this (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> truly says) out of <hi>Justin</hi> Martyr, and St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:30465:56"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But still Mr. <hi>O.</hi> misrepresents Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> as if He were positive herein, which is not so. For 1. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> lays down his position very cautiously — <hi>it should seem:</hi> intimating, it was not very clear from those Words of <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for these Words many imply only, that every Temple had but one Altar, as it is with us, and yet there might be more Temples than one in the Bishop's Churches, and therefore more Altars. 2. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> at the same time, thinketh the Bishop's Churches to have been Diocesan: For though they had not several Altars, yet they had several Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or lesser Temples (says He) as the Jews had their Synagogues. So that the one Numerical Altar in the Bishop's Church, does not prove his Church to consist of one Congregation only in this Learned Gentleman's Opinion; no more than the one Altar in the Temple of the Jews, proves there were no Synagogues. 3. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> to back his Conjecture, grounded on <hi>Ignatius,</hi> produces two Testimonies, the one out of <hi>Justin,</hi> the other out of <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and because he is not positive or certain of the Conclusion he draws from them, it will be no breach of Modesty, if I examine whether Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> has well grounded his Conjecture on those two Fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Justin</hi> Martyr in his second Apology thus writes — <hi>All that live in Cities or Countries,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) <hi>in one place</hi> (so Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>) <hi>to Celebrate the Holy Eucharist.</hi> This Passage does not evince that the Bishop's Church taken for the whole Company of Believers united under him had but one Altar, for which I offer the following Reasons, <hi>First,</hi> Because <hi>Justin</hi> here intends not to give the <hi>Gentiles</hi> an Account of the Politie, and Government of the Christian Churches; nor how many sort of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Officers there were among them, nor how many Congregations under one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, but of the manner of their Divine Worship, and that not in one single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but in all; His meaning is that in all Towns and Countries through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, the Christians belonging to any one Congregation, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain district met together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all this there might be several Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations under One Bishop. If I for example should write to a Foreigner, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of our Worship here in <hi>England,</hi> not intermedling with the Nature of our Government, might I not, ought I not to say? All that live in Towns or Countries (or where-ever there is a Congregation) meet together in one place, though at the same time there be many Churches, and many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, united under one Bishop of the Diocess, which thus meet together for Divine Worship? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas <hi>Justin</hi> mentions the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, who Celebrates the Divine Worship in these single Congregations, there is no necessity of Understanding Him, speaking of the Bishop only. He may using one common Title for both, speak of the Presbyters, who preside o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Divine Worship in their particular Congregations. So Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds <hi>Antistes</hi> afterward; not the Bishop only, but the Bishop or Presbyter, that is, He who Ministers in the Congregation at that time. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Supposing He means the Bishop, He does but instance in, and exemplify the Christian Worship, by the most Honourable Assembly, <hi>sc.</hi> that, wherein the Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Ordinarily Presided in Person, not excluding others, wherein the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Ministred. <hi>Fourthly, Justin,</hi> because he writes in the Plural <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and of Christian Worship in General, or indefinitely must here intend all Christian Assembles in the World: And therefore it may as well hence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30465:56"/>
that there was but one Numerical Congregation or Altar in the World, as that there was but one in the Bishop's Church. Upon the whole matter, the Point is no manner of way proved from <hi>Justin</hi> Martyr.</p>
               <p>As for St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who condemns <hi>the setting up Altar against Altar,</hi> it can't thence be gathered, that a Diocesan Bishop had but one Numerical Altar. What this Father blames, is setting up an Altar against the Bishop's Altar, in opposition to it, not in Subordination to and Communion with it. It is true here what our Lord spake on another occasion, <hi>He that is not against the Bishop, is for him,</hi> and <hi>He that is not with the Bishop, is against Him.</hi> In St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Time there were several, not Oratories only, but <hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of St.</hi> Mark <hi>the Evangelist, Founder of the Church of</hi> Alexandria.</head>
               <p>I Having produced the testimony of <hi>Eusebius</hi> (<hi>Hist. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 16, 17.) in proof of a multitude of Christians at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> about the time that <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew wrote his Treatise, <hi>de vita Contemplativa,</hi> which was in the Days of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperor, or beginning of <hi>Nero'</hi>s Reign, near fifty Years after Christ, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> excepts against the Testimony as follows — <q>That this Passage of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> overthrows the notion of the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 18.</note> Learned Assertors of Episcopacy, <hi>that a Diocess is the lowest species of a Church:</hi> that <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks of Churches <hi>in the plural:</hi> that therefore there must be Bishops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and not one Bishop only: that <hi>Mark</hi> was an Evangelist, that is, <hi>an extraordinary Officer</hi> in that Church: that <hi>Annianus, Mark'</hi>s Successor was not a Bishop of a Superiour Order, but an Honourable President in their Assemblies, and a Moderator in their Synods, without Power of Jurisdiction over his Collegues.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I am not concerned in the private Opinions of Modern Authors, who assert <hi>a Diocess to be the lowest species of a Church:</hi> nor will I trouble my self to shew how they limit their Notion, and explain themselves in that point, nor whether Mr. <hi>O.</hi> fairly deduces his consequence from that Passage of <hi>Eusebius, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> therefore there must be Bishops, not one Bishop only of</hi> Alexandria. Let the Assertors of this Notion see to it, Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Reasoning, such as it is, affects not me nor my Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis, it being my firm perswasion, that a single Congregation as well as Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, is even in Scripture called a Church. Only let it be observed, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> grants, that there were according to <hi>Eusebius,</hi> several Churches or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but how He will Evince there were several Bishops there, I am yet to seek. 'Tis moreover supposed, that <hi>Mark</hi> was an Evangelist (or an Extraordinary Officer): And what then, still <hi>Annianus</hi> an Ordinary one might succeed him, in the Ordinary Office of Governing a Diocesan Church. <hi>See Part the first, Chapter the fifth.</hi> And tho' <hi>Mark</hi> was an Evangelist (an Extraordinary Officer) which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> must confess, and had Power over all the Presbyters there, yet (says Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) <hi>Annianus</hi> was not a Bishop of a Superior Order, with Power of Jurisdiction over his Collegues, but an Honourable President or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator in the Synods. But this is only Mr. <hi>O.'</hi>s singular conceit; we are in the present Controversy to be guided by what <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, <hi>that</hi> Annianus <hi>succeeded</hi> Mark, <hi>in the Administration of the</hi>

Can any one understand less there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, than that <hi>Annianus</hi> received the same, and all the Power of Jurisdiction, that <hi>Mark</hi> had? In short, I cannot discern Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has advanc'd any thing against me, or laid his own sentiments so close together, as to be consistent with themselves.

from the Acts. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Therapeutae</hi> composed Hymns of divers kinds in <hi>Metre,</hi> which the Christians did not till afterwards in the Days of the <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini. Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Therapeutae</hi> spread themselves throughout the World, and were many in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but the Cristians few; Whereunto it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Christians expounded the Law Allegorically, as is manifest from the Epistle to the Hebrews, and some Passages in St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s other Epistles: and besides, though the Jews did endeavour to improve the Law by some Allegorical deductions from it, yet they held Primarily unto the Literal sense, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly observed the Law; whereas the Christians rejected it in the Literal Sense, and adhered only to the Allegorical. This then proves the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> to be Christians, rather than Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> it must be confess'd, that the Christian Religion was then New, and the Writings of the Apostles and Evangelists of a later date; they could not in any reason be called Ancient. Nevertheless <hi>Philo,</hi> here meant the Writings of the Old Testament, which were out of controversy Ancient, and which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians even the Apostles and Evangelists made frequent use of. They may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough be called the Christians Ancient Authors. Besides, tho' <hi>Philo</hi> (this must be owned) believed the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> to be a Sect of the Jews, and because they were conversant in the Writings of the Old Testament, thence Collected, that they were of the Jewish Religion, yet this is no good Consequence. It would not pass (I think) if one should say <hi>Timothy</hi> was no Christian, but a Jew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Apostle saith, <hi>He knew the Holy Scriptures</hi> (of the Old Testament) <hi>which were able to make him wise unto Salvation. Thirdly, Philo</hi> does not affirm the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> pray'd twice a Day only, but intimates the quite contrary. His Words are, <hi>they passed the whole day in exercising themselves,</hi> understand, in Prayers, Praises, and other Offices of Piety and Devotion. Hence rather it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that the <hi>Therapeutae,</hi> pray'd three times a Day, as did the Ancient, and more devout part of the Jews, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 17. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3. 1. as well as the Christians. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is no<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Soc.</hi> l. 6. c. 8. and <hi>Theod.</hi> l. 2. c. 24. Say <hi>Ignatius</hi> introduced singing alternately at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
                  </note> doubt with me, but the Christians composed Hymns from the beginning, and 'tis not unlikely in <hi>Metre</hi> too, if singing be a good proof of Metrical Praises, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 25. Lastly the Christians were spread throughout the World, as the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> were: for if (as <hi>Ignatius</hi> teaches) Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were throughout the World, it follows of necessity that so were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians also, in as large a Sense as the <hi>Therapeutae.</hi> Upon the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> here is no proof, that I can see of the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> being Jews, not Cristians.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, that they were Christians may be gathered hence, because their Religious Exercises, their Lives and Manners, and their Discipline were conformable to the Christians, even in things peculiar to the Christians. They divided their Substance among their Friends, as the Christians are said to have done in the <hi>Acts:</hi> The Women among them ingaged into a State of Celibacy, which the Jewish Women would not no; they observed <hi>Lent,</hi> or the Fast about Good <hi>Friday</hi> more strictly, than at other times; for indeed otherwise their whole Life was Abstinence. In a Word, they had three Orders of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Officers: <hi>First,</hi> they that performed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (that is Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters), <hi>Secondly,</hi> they that were employ'd about the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (that is Deacons) and</p>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:30465:58"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> those that obtained the highest degree of Office amongst them (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that is Bishops. On these and other accounts (which I pass by) <hi>Eusebius</hi> roundly affirms — <hi>I judge that</hi> Philo'<hi>s Words are plainly, and without controversy to be understood of Christians.</hi> Besides, I cannot easily perswade my self, that <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Valesius</hi> at this distance of time should see further into the matter, than <hi>Eusebius, Jerom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who flourish'd much nearer those Days, whereof <hi>Philo</hi> wrote. Nor do we ever read of the <hi>Therape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ae,</hi> before <hi>Philo</hi> brought them to Light, for any thing I have found; and as for <hi>Josephus</hi> (who doubtless had read <hi>Philo</hi>) he takes no Notice at all of them, 'tis probable, because they were Christians. So that I conceive them, to be as New as the Christians, yea Christians, though <hi>Philo</hi> did not or would not own it, being desirous (it should seem) to commend his own Nation and Religion, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting, the strict Holiness and Devotion of these <hi>Therapeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whoever will impartially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what has been said, will (I hope) be induced to believe they were Christians. I am pretty sure 'tis the only way to reconcile the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought on both sides. The Christians then, (as I designed to prove) must have been many at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> whilst <hi>Mark</hi> presided there or soon after: they had many Churches, and <hi>Annianus</hi> succeeded <hi>Mark</hi> in the Government of them, we reading of no other Bishops, then at or near <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but <hi>Annianus;</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has not told us of one.</p>

                  <hi>Ans. First,</hi> all this is nothing to the Argument drawn from <hi>Annianus</hi> his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Mark,</hi> and having the Administration of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; for he might succeed in the Administration, when the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list left it, and betook himself to another Work. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I conceive there were three several Persons Named <hi>Mark,</hi> all to be found in the Scriptures before cited; for 'tis in no wise probable, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> should all have the same Person to be their Disciple and Companion, since they all took a different Course, and Travelled into distant Provinces to propagate the Gospel. <hi>Thirdly, Paul</hi> fell out with, and separated from <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who took <hi>Mark</hi> along with him, <hi>Paul</hi> refusing it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. we never read that they pieced again. 'Tis not likely then, that the same <hi>Mark</hi> should accompany <hi>Paul</hi> afterwards; and yet we read of one <hi>Mark</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> all along in the Texts alledged; Nor can it be thought that <hi>Paul</hi> would receive this <hi>Mark</hi> again, who had deserted

him, and for that reason been rejected by him. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There was not a right understanding between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears from the Epistles to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 'Tis not then probable, that the same <hi>Mark</hi> attended them both. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The several Characters and Descriptions, given unto <hi>Mark</hi> in the places adduced by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Bishop, and not the People, which the Dissenters will not very well like of, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Presbyters Ordained new Presbyters, which will scarce go down with the Dissenting Congregations now a Days. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting accidents the Patriarch or (as Mr. O.) the Moderator of the Class was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for Life, which the Presbyterians will not allow of. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters are every whit, as much departed from the Observance of St. <hi>Mark'</hi>s model, as they can pretend we are, yea, and much more too.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30465:60"/>

                  </gap> Officers, of what Character is not said; whereas <hi>Eutychius</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Twelve only, and all those Presbyters: on these accounts, then he is of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He relates many things in his Annals (whereof these <hi>Origines</hi> are a part) against the Faith of all approved History. He makes the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to have consisted of 2048. Bishops, which is not credible: He says, <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified in the Twenty Second Year after Christ: and he reckons <hi>Origen</hi> a Bishop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fouthly,</hi> Even in these <hi>Origines,</hi> he is not at one with himself. <q>He writes, that <hi>Mark</hi> went unto <hi>Barca</hi> to preach the Gospel, that then <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi> dy'd, and <hi>Nero</hi> succeeded him: that in the Reign of <hi>Nero, Peter</hi> the Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, wrote the Gospel of <hi>Mark,</hi> with <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue, and in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet that <hi>Mark</hi> was slain at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the first Year of <hi>Nero.</hi>
                  </q> But if <hi>Mark</hi> was Martyr'd at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the first Year of <hi>Nero,</hi> it cannot be, that he was at <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Nero'</hi>s Reign, and joyned with him in Writing the Gospel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Eutychius'</hi>s story seems most improbable, and in my Judgment over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws its self. For if the Presbyters had the Power, first of chusing, and then Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining one from among themselves to be Patriarch, and after that, Ordained the new Presbyter also, to what purpose was a Bishop created? was he to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Clouts, to sit in his Chair and gravely to look on, whilst the Eleven Presbyters Chose and Ordained the Twelveth, and he have no Hand in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Origines</hi> consists of so many Childish, Ridiculous, and Absurd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that no wise Man can given any credit to so trifling an Author. That story of <hi>Mark'</hi>s going to a Shoe-Maker or Cobler, to have his Shoe-Latchet mended; of <hi>Hananias</hi> pricking his Finger with the Awl, and thereupon grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angry: of <hi>Mark'</hi>s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> him with a Promise to heal his Finger, if He would belive in Christ: of <hi>Hananias</hi> believing and being cured; and <hi>Lastly,</hi> of <hi>Mark'</hi>s Baptizing him thereupon, and making him Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is to me incredible. Another of the like Nature, is that of <hi>Alexander'</hi>s desiring that the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> should not be called <hi>Papa,</hi> whereas it had been decreed before in the Days of <hi>Heracles</hi> (I suppose for distinctions sake) Bishops being stiled Fathers, therefore it was judged fit, that the Patriarch should be Honoured with the Title of Grand-Father. But-why <hi>Alexander</hi> should be so Self-denying, as to refuse an Honourable Title, which several of his Predecessors had had before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him, is to me a Mystery. Again, that wonderful design of <hi>Mark</hi> (as <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it, to have always the exact Number of Twelve Presbyters in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> appears to me not very Solid. <hi>Lastly,</hi> of the same stamp is, that request of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to be crucify'd with his Head downward, that he might not have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to die, in the same manner as Jesus Christ did. I fancy, that <hi>Peter</hi> never requested such a thing, or if He did, that <hi>Nero</hi> never granted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Whereas <hi>Eutychius</hi> would make us believe, that <hi>Mark'</hi>s Rule about the Presbyters of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (not the Neighbouring Bishops of <hi>Egypt</hi>) chusing and Ordaining the Patriarchs, and Presbyters continued unto the Days of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> (who must therefore be the last that was Ordained by the Presbyters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 310.): Yet St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who flourish'd above 60 Years before <hi>Alexander,</hi> has something that makes me suspect the contrary, and that <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:30465:61"/>
establish'd no such Order at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprians'</hi>s Words are these — <hi>Propter quod diligenter de Traditione divina, &amp;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. 67. Ox.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostolica observatione servandum est, &amp; tenendum, quod apud nos quoque, &amp; fere per Provincias Universas tenetur, ut ad Ordinationes rite Celebrandas, ad eam plebem Cui Praepositus Ordinatur, Episcopi ejusdem Provinciae proximi quique conveniant, &amp; Episcopus delegatur plebe presente,</hi> &amp;c. This is part of a Letter, written by the Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to the Churches of <hi>Leon, Asturica,</hi> and <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> from whence 'tis manifest, that this was a Divine Tradition, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Practice, that the Bishops of the Province should Assemble, Chuse and Ordain a new Bishop, and that <hi>it universally obtained, apud nos</hi> (says the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>among us</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and almost in all the Provinces in the World, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire besure. And I take <hi>Cyprian</hi> to be a much trustier Author, than <hi>Eutychius,</hi> or <hi>Jerom</hi> either.</p>
               <p>To support this Testimony of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> I produce the <hi>First,</hi> of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Canons, which were collected before St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> at least a good while before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council (as Dr. <hi>Beverigde</hi> has shewn)<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cod. Can. Vind.</hi> I. 1. c. 4.</note> wherein, as is by <hi>Selden</hi> pretended, the Custom of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was alter'd; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If then this Apostolical Canon was in force before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> then it was not the <hi>Nieene</hi> Council, which altered the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Custom, as <hi>Eutychius</hi> and <hi>Selden</hi> suppose, it having been a much more Ancient practise, it seems for the Provincial Bishops, to Ordain Bishops. And so <hi>Eutychius</hi> is mistaken in this point also. If ever there was such a Rule establish'd by <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of Presbyters Ordaining Bishops, or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, it was changed before <hi>Alexander</hi> or the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, yea, before St. <hi>Cyprian'</hi>s time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Whereas <hi>Eutychius</hi> asserts, there were no Bishops in <hi>Egypt</hi> till <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> it is proved to the contrary by that most Learned Prelate Bishop <hi>Pearson,</hi> from several good Testimonies, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly<note place="margin">

                  </hi> also, it would be hard for Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to give a satisfactory answer to it. Besides 'tis said, that <hi>Mark</hi> made Bishops, <hi>per Regiones illas,</hi> doubtless the meaning is through all the Countries, that he travelled between <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis;</hi> and surely <hi>Egypt</hi> was one of them.

                  </hi> and <hi>Leader,</hi> in all the <hi>Romantick</hi> Stories of the Antiquity of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation and Church. It is to be observed <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> the last of the three takes upon him to mend the former, <hi>Fordon,</hi> and <hi>Major,</hi> saying (what Mr. <hi>O.</hi> leaves out) Palladius <hi>was the first, that was made Bishop,</hi> by the Pope <hi>among the</hi> Scots; <hi>whereas in former times, Bishops were taken out of the</hi> Culdees <hi>and Monks, the People chusing them.</hi> Here then the Witnesses do not agree among themselves: For <hi>Fordon</hi> says without Bishops, and <hi>Major</hi> Presbyters only, but <hi>Boethius</hi> plainly intimates the <hi>Scots</hi> had Bishops in former times, though not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Stamp, nor thence sent unto the <hi>Scots. Palladius</hi> was the first of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops, not the first Bishop. Whoever chose'em is nothing to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: The <hi>Scots</hi> had Bishops before <hi>Palladius,</hi> according to <hi>Boethius,</hi> who were pickt out of the Monks and <hi>Culdees:</hi> But he says, not Ordained by them. It may as well be affirmed, that because our Bishops at this Day are taken out of the Presbyters, that therefore they are Ordained by them. <hi>Lastly,</hi> The said Archbishop <hi>Usher,</hi> there produces another Testimony out of <hi>John Baly,</hi> who Writes — <q>
                     <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent among the <hi>Scots,</hi> that he might establish the Episcopal Order among them, <hi>after the</hi> Roman <hi>Fashion,</hi> for (<hi>He adds</hi>) the <hi>Scots</hi> had before that time their Bishops, and (other). Ministers, as it was among the <hi>Britains</hi> after the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Manner. But it pleased not the <hi>Romans (the Popes)</hi> who affected Ceremonies, and hated the <hi>Asiaticks.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Scots</hi> were Anciently the Inhabitans of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet says Mr. <hi>O. these Authors call the Ancient Inhabitants of</hi> (the now) Scotland, <hi>by the Name they were known in their own days,</hi> and to them <hi>Palladius</hi> is thought to have been sent.</p>
               <p>True! But 'twas their ignorance or worse, nothing being more clear, than that the Ancient Inhabitants of the now <hi>Scotland,</hi> were <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> not <hi>Scots.</hi> This is fully made out in the <hi>Historical Account</hi> of the Church-Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as by Archbishop <hi>Usher'</hi>s Authorities, to whom I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Bede</hi> l. 5. c. 10. relates, how that <hi>Columba</hi> was the first Teacher of the Christian Faith, among the <hi>Tramontane Picts,</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> thus glosses on that Passage — <hi>He was the first</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> At this rate all Authorities may be eluded: And all the Testimonies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in favour of his Cause, may easily be laid aside. <hi>Bede</hi>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:30465:65"/>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> goes on to acquaint us, <q>Christianity was much more Ancient in the North of the now <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that 'tis proved by Bishop <hi>Cowper.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Bishop <hi>Cowper,</hi> laboured under the common Disease of easily believing, and advancing the Antiquity and Honour (as he thought) of his own Nation. He brought no Testimony of Credit, but that out of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> which belongs unto the Southern <hi>Britains</hi> (for of <hi>Tertullian'</hi>s we have before Treated). But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would be resolved in some Queries.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>First,</hi> When the Fathers mention <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>

                     <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> &amp;c. to have Preached the Gospel in <hi>Britain,</hi> what reason have we to exclude North <hi>Britain?</hi> The zeal of those Apostles and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Men, and their Charity would Prompt them, to endeavour the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Gospel throughout <hi>Britain;</hi> and part of the now <hi>Scotland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed then to the <hi>British</hi> Kings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I know no Father that mentions <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi> except haply <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> who is the Father of a Thousand Lyes, or <hi>Fordon, Major, Boethius, Fleming, Balaeus,</hi> and<note place="margin">See <hi>Bellar. de</hi> S. E. p. 91.</note> such other later and Legendary Writers. I can give se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral good reasons against the North-<hi>Britains</hi> being so early converted, and good ones too, as I think <hi>Britain</hi> Anciently was divided into very many petty Kingdoms: None of the Princes received the Faith very early (that we know of) save <hi>Lucius</hi> perhaps: The <hi>Romans</hi> never penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the now <hi>Scotland,</hi> till a good while after, and it was by their means in part, that Christianity spread its self. The <hi>Picts</hi> in North-<hi>Scotland</hi> never stoop't to their Yoke, which rendred their Conversion more difficult. And something (I hope) in this point may be ascribed unto the Secret Will and Providence of God. Can Mr. <hi>O.</hi> give me any other Reasons than such as these, that the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Angli</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who over-run <hi>Britain,</hi> were no sooner converted, tho' <hi>Tertullian</hi> reckons the <hi>Germans</hi> in General, to have been Christians in his time? Nor were the Apostles themselves, nor the Apostolical Men always Successful in their endeavours. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was forbid to Preach in <hi>Asia, Acts,</hi> 16. 6. 'Tis a wretched way of proving a matter of Fact in Question, from such slender Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities. By the like Arguments one might prove, that all <hi>Europe, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> embraced the Gospel a Thousand Years since, even the most Northern <hi>Scythians,</hi> the most Eastern <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Seres,</hi> and the <hi>Africans</hi> about the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope.</hi> In short, though <hi>Paul plants, and</hi> Apollos <hi>Waters, yet 'tis God, who gives the Increase.</hi> 'Tis certain the Apostles themselves did not always take Fish, where-ever they cast their Net. Our Lord foretold them as much, directing them therefore to <hi>shake off the dust of their Feet, as a Testimony against them, that rejected their Doctrine.</hi> But enough of Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s first Query.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                  <q>He asks if the North-<hi>Britains</hi> received their first Conversion by Men sent from <hi>Rome</hi> (as seems from <hi>Bede,</hi> E. H. l. 3. c. 4) How came they to keep their <hi>Easter,</hi>
                  </q> after the Eastern Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is accounted for by the Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi> and Mr. <hi>O.</hi> ought to have acquiess'd, or else refuted<note place="margin">Hist. Account <hi>p.</hi> 66. §. 7.</note> the Bishop, and not thus frivolously repeated the bare Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection about <hi>Easter,</hi> without Vindicating it against the Bishop. But he seems to read Books on purpose to furnish himself with little Objections; not with a disposition to hearken unto Reason, but to Spin out, and continue

disputes, for Ever. Besides, the North <hi>Britain</hi> (here so called by Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) is by <hi>Bede</hi> in his History described, to be the most Southern part of the now <hi>Scotland,</hi> adjoyning vnto <hi>England,</hi> and called <hi>Galloway</hi> or <hi>Annandale,</hi> on this side <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> But what is this, to the Northern <hi>Tramontaene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> farther pleads these words of <hi>Bede.</hi> I. 1. ch. 13. <q>That<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Def.</hi> p. 148.</note> by the Pope <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent <hi>primus Episcopus ad Scotos Creden tes.</hi>
                  </q> therefore the <hi>Scots</hi> were Christians before <hi>Palladius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If this Testimony be adduced to any purpose, 'tis to prove, that the <hi>Tramontane Picts</hi> received <hi>Palladius,</hi> their first Bishop from <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, that before that time they believed, and had Presbytery only, but no Bishops, because <hi>Palladius</hi> was the <hi>first.</hi> Now to shew the Disingenuity of this Suggestion, it must be noted very briefly out of the <hi>Historical Account,</hi> that by <hi>Scots,</hi> are here meant the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that <hi>Bede</hi> has not a word of their form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that some Copies read <hi>ad Scotos convertendos,</hi> which would imply, that they were not yet Christians; that <hi>primus</hi> (in <hi>Prosper,</hi> whence <hi>Bede</hi> is thought to have taken his Narrative) in some Copies is read <hi>primitus,</hi> that is, <hi>formerly;</hi> that <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Patricius,</hi> were designed for the Primates only, or the first Bishops in rank; and finally, that 'tis true, <hi>Palladius</hi> was the first Bishop, sent into <hi>Ireland by the Pope;</hi> Yet there were Bishops before that Time, of which Number Archbishop <hi>Usher</hi> produces Four.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Prim.</hi> E. B. p. 800. 801.</note> This was the first attempt of reducing <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Obedience of the Pope. I'll say nothing of Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s confessing <hi>Palladius</hi> was sent into <hi>Ireland. Plea</hi> 148.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> now promises us an Instance of Presbyters Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Plea 152.</note> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> 'tis that of <hi>Segenius</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </q> 
                  <hi>Bede</hi> H. E. l. 3. 5, 15</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> acknowledges that there were Bishops at <hi>Hy,</hi> and in that Province from <hi>Bede,</hi> lib. 3. ch. 4. and the <hi>Ulster</hi> Annals agree hereunto. What need we say any more to resolve this difficulty? Some Bishop with the Abbot and his Presbyters, laying hands on (as our Custom is at this Day) Ordained <hi>Aidan,</hi> For to what purpose were these Bishops among them, if not to Ordain? The Government was in the Abbots Hands: the Presbyters were able to Minister in the Word and Sacraments: The Bishops bufiness then was certainly to Ordain.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> excepts against the <hi>Ulster</hi> Annals, as not being attested by any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Age: And yet they agree in most things with <hi>Adamnanus,</hi> and with <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Plea</hi> p. 153.</note> at <hi>Hy</hi>) <hi>He was subject to the Abbot,</hi> and thinks he has here sufficiently reply'd, to My Lord of St. <hi>Asaph'</hi>s Solution of that difficulty; I do therefore add thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nothing is more certain than that Bishops were wont to be in Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I read in <hi>Theodoret,</hi> of eleven residing in those of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from their Youth up to their Extreame Old Age, and when they were Bishops too.

                  <hi>Theod.</hi> E. H. l. 4. ch. 22. Now though the Bishops of the Province were subject to the Abbot of <hi>Hy,</hi> yet it must remembred also, that the Abbots Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction extended it self throughout the Province.

                  </hi> says, the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bishops were to the Abbots of <hi>Hy, viz.</hi> within the Abbot's Jurisdiction. But we know for all this the Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Dean of a Cathedral cannot Ordain.

                  <q>It was it seems<note place="margin">Hist. Account <hi>p.</hi> 101. 102.</note> the Custom at that time, for the Priests being all equals to break the Lord's Bread in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> together. A certain Bishop being then at <hi>Hy,</hi> and not discovering his Character, was by <hi>Columba</hi> invited to break the Lord's Bread with him: But <hi>Columba</hi> at length discerning him to be a Bishop, would have the Bishop break the Bread alone,</q> as Bishops then used to do: which shews that notwithstanding the Abbots Temporal Jurisdiction (as I may call it) <hi>Columba</hi> acknowledged the Episcopal Order, to be Superior to that of a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:30465:67"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It cannot with any reason be imagined, but that there were Bishops in the Province of <hi>Hy,</hi> because <hi>Columba,</hi> the first Abbot thereof came out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> there we read of Bishops among whom he was educated, convers't freely with them, and was Ordained by them. He was Ordained Deacon by <hi>Finian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Meath,</hi> and was an Intimate Friend of <hi>Columbanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Laghlin,</hi> and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Presbyter by one of them, most probably by <hi>Columbanus,</hi> from whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he might take his Name, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> did that of <hi>Pamphilus, Hist. Account c.</hi> 5. After he was Abbot of <hi>Hy,</hi> he propagated Bishops among the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> from whom our <hi>English Saxons</hi> derived. On this account it was my Lord of St. <hi>Asaph</hi> argued, that the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ordinations must needs be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal, meaning those at <hi>Hy:</hi> which he confirmed by this Consideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Romans</hi> (<hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, and his <hi>Associates</hi>) did not dislike the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that they found in the <hi>British</hi> Church, as being Episcopal, though derived from the Monastery of <hi>Hy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>O.</hi> excepts, <hi>that if by</hi> British <hi>Bishops be meant the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plea <hi>p.</hi> 156.</note> 
                  <hi>Church of South</hi> Britain, <hi>'tis not to the purpose as we observed before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nothing is more plain than that my Lord Bishop meant the Church of South <hi>Britain.</hi> Whatever Mr. <hi>O.</hi> observed before is not Material, but my Lord Bishop's Observation is manifestly to the purpose. For if the <hi>Romans</hi> did not dislike the Orders of the Church of South <hi>Britain,</hi> they could not dislike the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Hy,</hi> because the South <hi>Britains</hi> derived their Orders from <hi>Hy,</hi> and doubtless were the same: and the reason they disliked neither was because they were Episcopal, as were the <hi>Romans</hi> and all the World beside.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> adds,<q> if the Orders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> at <hi>Hy,</hi> be intended as not disliked by the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet (says he) the <hi>Romans</hi> were not so ignorant of the Privileges of Abbots as to dislike their Ordinations, which are allowed by that Church. <hi>Decret. Greg. Abbas, si sit</hi> Presbyter, conferre <hi>potest Ordinem Clericalem.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans. Ordo Clericalis</hi> may possibly here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> neither the Episcopal nor Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial, nor the <hi>Diaconal</hi> Order, but the Inferior Orders only, such as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Deacons, <hi>Acoluthists, Exorcists, Psalmists, Lectors</hi> and <hi>Door-keepers.</hi> But that the Episcopal Order is not meant, is to me past dispute: For the <hi>Romans</hi> never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an Abbot Presbyter to Ordain a Bishop that I heard of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If this Privilege was allowed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifs to the Presbyter, Abbots. It was allowed to such of them only, who 'tis likely owned the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Roman</hi> See. But not unto those, who refused subjection to it, as did the Abbots of <hi>Hy,</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> knows very Well. This Privilege then, whatever it was, could not be the reason of the <hi>Romans</hi> not dislkeing the foresaid Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Decretals mentioned were made or put together, by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Nineth Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Thirteenth Century, about 709 Years after these Abbots of <hi>Hy,</hi> almost as many after <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, and therefore not apposite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here alledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> seems here to countenance Presbyterian Orders, by Popish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Canonsframed in the Dregs of Time, when the <hi>Romish</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions were at their Height. But I like them never the better for that. The <hi>Romans</hi> are more excusable in this then our Dissenters, 'Twas their Principle, that all Church-Officers derive from, and depend meerly upon the Pope's Will. He may then communicate the Priviledge to whom he will, even to a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30465:67"/>
Deacon. But that a Presbyterian Dissenter should justify his Orders by a Pope's decree is something extraordinary and Extravagant, as I fancy. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would observe that <hi>Columba</hi> a Presbyter himself usurp't (or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Prince of the Province of <hi>Delried</hi>) a Dominion over a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in the North-West of the now <hi>Scotland,</hi> over the Monks and <hi>Culdees</hi> (if any such were), yea even over his Fellow Presbyters themselves: for all or many of them at least were Presbyters, and lastly, over the Bishop also, if it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged there were such in the Province of <hi>Hy.</hi> Besides, he yet retained a Jurisdiction over the Monastery of <hi>Dearmuch</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which himself had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly erected, and his Successors over many more Monasteries of lesser Note, which sprang out of these two, both in <hi>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Now this is a wonderful piece of Antiquity to justifie the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<note place="margin">Bede <hi>E. H. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note> and Practices of the United Brethren at present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. If it proves Presbyterian Ordination it destroys Presbyterian Parity, unless Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will assert, that the Monks of <hi>Hy</hi> were equal to the Abbots, and that every Monk was the Abbot in his Turn, <hi>pro Tempore.</hi> What Room then has Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to talk of Bishops receiving their Power from Kings, ruling over many Churches and Congregations, exercising Jurisdiction over their Fellow Presbyters (as he thinks) and that for life too? All this did <hi>Columba</hi> and his Successors, who are pretended by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to have restored the <hi>Culdees</hi> (or Presbyters) strength against the incroachments of <hi>Palladius.</hi> But all this while the Tyrants only were changed, not the Tyranny, the name altered not the thing. Instead of <hi>Palladius,</hi> the <hi>Culdees</hi> and Monks were in the Hands of <hi>Columba:</hi> and in the place of a Bishop was set up an Archpresbyter. Moreover, I would ask whether in the supposed Ordinations at <hi>Hy</hi> by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Monk-Presbyters could or did Ordain without the Abbot-Presbyters. If not (as I believe all will and must grant) our United Bretheren will find little relief from this rare Instance of Presbyterian Parity and Ordination.</p>
               <p>I should here have concluded this Chapter, but Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in the midst of this Controversie, has interwoven an invidious Reflection upon Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and asserted, that the Hierarchy in the Churches of<note place="margin">Plea <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note> the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had their Platform from the Heathen, who had their Flamens and Arch-Flamens, and I know not what.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If the Heathens had Sundry Officers in the Administrations of their Idolatrous Religion, subordinate to one another, it will not follow the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans took it from them? Why not from the Jewish Hierarchy? His beloved <hi>Hilarius Sardus</hi> is of this Opinion: or why may it not not be thought a piece of Natural Religion, wherein the Patriarch, Jews, Gentiles, all agree? But let us see how he attempts to make good this Reflection of the Christians, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving their Hierarchy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Heathen. He grounds it on the Epistle of <hi>Julian</hi> to <hi>Arsacius,</hi> the Gentiles Chief-Priest in <hi>Galatia,</hi> and after the Citation of a scrap out of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> which I do not find in the places directed to, cries out, <hi>Here is a Precedent for Bishops intermedling with state affairs.</hi> Whereas any one may know that will but read, or understand that Epistle (which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> never did I preceive) that 'tis intirely spent about Religious matters, and directs how <hi>Arsacius</hi> the Chief Priest should behave himself, in Governing the affairs of the Gentile Religion. Thus we are wont to be teazed by a sort of Men, that do not or will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30465:68"/>
not understand what they say; who, so they may cast dirt upon us, care not how ignorantly and falsly they do it. But to let this pass. The Question here is, whether the Christians derived their form of Church Government by Bishops from the Gentiles, or the Gentiles from them. This latter I undertake to make out. <hi>First,</hi> From the Ancient Writers of the Primitive Church, who argue for the Divine Authority of Bishops, as being borrowed from the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> High Priests, Priests and <hi>Levites.</hi> All the World knows this; I need not bring forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Testimonies, even Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s so oft mentioned <hi>Hilary</hi> is one: but of this I have spoke before. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although the <hi>Druids</hi> according to <hi>Caesar,</hi> had such a sort of Government among them yet in the East, where E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy was first established, the Gentiles had no such Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appears from what <hi>Eusebius</hi> has noted, of <hi>Maximinus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 8. c. 14. L. 9. C. 4.</note> the Heathen Emperor, who observing the way of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among the Christians, and believing it conduced to the furtherance of their Religion, for the same reason appointed the same among the Gentiles. He then drew his Pattern from the Christians. Which is moreover confirmed by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> to have been then<note place="margin">
                     <hi>de morte Pers.</hi> c. 36.</note> newly taken up by the Heathens — <hi>Maximinus novo more Sacerdotes Maximos per singulas Civitates singulos ex Primoribus fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit — parum<expan>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> hoc fuit, nisi etiam Provinciis ex alticre Dignitatis gradu singulos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quasi Pontifices superponeret — Maximinus</hi> then first (<hi>Novo more</hi>) created Chief Priests in every City, and as if this had been too little, he Ordained as it were High-Priests over Whole Provinces: It was then a new device among the Gentiles, first set up by <hi>Maxinisnus</hi> in conformity to the Christians. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The same is proved out of that very Epistle of <hi>Julian,</hi> to <hi>Arsacius</hi> the chief-Priest of <hi>Galatia,</hi> though quoted by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> himself, as if it were on his side. I am ashamed any Man, that pretends to Religion and Learning, should thus foully misrepresent Authors, and make as if they had written, what is manifest they never so much as dreamed of. To shew this, I'll first sum up what <hi>Sozomen</hi> himself relates concerning this matter, and then give you an abridgment of <hi>Julian'</hi>s Epistle, that follows in the same Chapter. He says — <q>The Emperor (<hi>Julian</hi>) desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Sozom. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c:</hi> 16.</note> that the Gentile Religion should prevail, but observing that it was far surmounted by the Christian, was exceedingly troubled. When he thought with himself, that Christianity was chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the lives and manners of those, who profess'd it, he determined with himself, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Temples of the Gentiles with the same Rule and Order, which was in use among the Christians: <hi>also with the same degrees and Prerogatives of Supremacy.</hi>
                  </q> And sundry other things are mentioned, wherein <hi>Julian</hi> was resolved to imitate the Christians: He adds in general — <q>The Emperor endeavoured to conform the Gentile unto the Christian Institutions.</q> Then follows <hi>Julian'</hi>s Letter to <hi>Arsacius,</hi> the Chief Priest of <hi>Galatia,</hi> wherein there is not a Syllable of State-Affairs (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has falsly suggested), not a word that intimates, as if the Christian derived their Government from the Gentiles. <q>He only admonishes <hi>Arsacius</hi> to take care about Sundry, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar things belonging unto Morality, such as Hospitality to Strangers, care about burying the dead, that the Flamines should not frequent the Theater, nor Drink in Taverns, nor profess any Trade. He advises him to build Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:30465:68"/>
for the Poor, and promises to furnish him with Moneys to do it: He warns him not to pay visits often to Great Men, but to write to 'em only, and live retiredly: that the Inferior Flamines should not meet secular Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, when they entred the Cities in Pomp, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> they came to the Temples of the Gods; who when they are entred, are then but private Persons. In a Word, he Orders <hi>Arsacius</hi> to endeavour to make the Flamines good Men, by shaming them unto their Duty or perswading them, or removing them from the Priestly Ministry: to bestow Honour on them who obey'd, but the the stubborn and contumacious to expel.</q> 
                  <hi>First,</hi> From the Whole it appears that all this Policy of <hi>Julian</hi> was taken from the Christians, whose Rules and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he knew very well, having himself once been a Christian, and a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Church. True! many Writers of latter Ages have taught, that the Christians followed the Gentiles in their Church-Government. But 'tis not my business to account for the dreams and fancies of School-Men, and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that follow them: Although at the same time I am of Opinion, that the Primitive Church regulated their Parishes, Diocesses and Provinces, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Divisions, which they found ready made to their Hands, by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrate, and perhaps to the districts formerly appointed by the <hi>Druids</hi> in these Western parts, which might occasion those Authors to affirm, that the Episcopal Government it self, was borrowed from them, which is (we see) a great mistake. To conclude; seeing we have found the Government of the Gentile Religion (in the East at least) was taken from the Christian, being before more like unto the Presbyterian or Congregational, the Reflection may be retorted upon our Adversaries, and it may with more Truth be said, that they had their Pattern from the Gentile Priests. If any one desire a more full and Learned account of this, let him consult the late Bishop of <hi>Worcester.</hi>

its self.

Until Mr. <hi>O.</hi> produces an Instance of one
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30465:69"/>
of these kinds, he is far short of proving that Presbyters, and People may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an accusation against their Bishop, as <hi>Timothy</hi> had Power to do against Elders. For <hi>Timothy</hi> had Power to receive an Accusation upon information of Witnesses, and to rebuke the offender accordingly, and if need were to reject him, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10.

What may fairly be Collected from this Epistle follows: As <hi>First,</hi> It may from this Epistle be gathered, that <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis,</hi> after they had been proved guilty of Idolatry were deposed from their Bishopricks. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> were substituted in their Rooms. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Idolatrous Bishops were deprived, and the new ones Chosen and Ordained, by the Provincial Bishops in the Presence, and with the Concurrence or consent of the People: For thus <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaks — <q>The People have Power either of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing good Bishops or refusing unworthy ones: <hi>Again,</hi> the People ought to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a Wicked Bishop: that Episcopal Ordinations ought to be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>sub populi assistentis Conscientia,</hi> with the knowledge and assent of the People present, to the end that by the People the Crimes of bad Men may be detected, the Merits of good Men may be testified, and so a right and regular Ordination may be made, which shall have been examined by the judgment and suffrage of all. St. <hi>Cyprian goes on</hi> — That is to be observed, which is held among us in <hi>Africa,</hi> and almost in all Provinces, that to the end Ordinations be rightly made, all the next Bishops of the same Province meet together with the People, for whom the Bishop is design'd; and let the Bishop be chosen in the presence of the People, which knows and has been acquainted with the Lives and Conversations of the Candidates. This we understand has been done among you, in the Ordination of <hi>Sabinus</hi> our Collegue, how that the Bishoprick was given him, and hands laid on him with the Suffrage of the whole Fraternity, and by the Judgment (or decree) of the Bishops, who were present at the Meeting, and who had sent their Letters (of Consent) concerning the Bishop to be chosen.</q> That which I would deduce from all this is, that because the Power of chusing and Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bishop, was lodg'd in the Provincial Bishops together with the People of the Diocess, it must follow that the Power of depriving, consequently of receiving Accusations against the Bishop, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in the same Provincial Bishops, and and the People of the Diocess. And if this be so, then <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> were deposed by the Provincial Bishops, in the presence and with the Consent of the People, and so Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s inference from this story will not hold, <hi>sc:</hi> that the Presbyters and People may receive an accusation against their Bishop, that's to say in a Judiciary way. Moreover it seems to me very probable by some passages in this Epistle, that the People's Power in chusing or rejecting their Bishop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted only in the Testimony, which they gave to the Provincial Bishops, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

the Lives and Conversations of the Bishop propounded by the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bishops to succeed. I gather this from those words — <hi>

However this be, it is manifest from the whole — that the Presbyters and the People did not (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Provincial Bishops) by virtue of their own sole and proper Power hear, or receive Accusations in a Judiciary way, much less take upon 'em to give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon their own Bishops, which is the thing affirmed by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> without any ground or Reason produced out of these Epistles.</p>

After this the Rector gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nevertheless, that the Presbyters were not, ought not to be utterly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from all interest in the Government of the Church, as appears from the Council of <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 15. Hereunto after some Cavils, and charging me with contradicting my self (I leave that to the Judgment of the Reader) the Minister gravely admonishes us — —, <hi>that</hi> Cyprian <hi>did nothing without the Council of his Presbyters, and without the Consent of the People</hi> Epistle 6.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This Passage proves not that the Presbyters were equal unto St. <hi>Cyprian:</hi> it may as well be said the People were equal both to the Presbyters and to St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> All that can hence be gathered is, what I intimated and granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Presbyters have a subordinate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Philostorgius</hi> saith, that <hi>Ulphilas</hi> one of the Transistrian<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Scythians,</hi> who by the Ancients are called <hi>Getae,</hi> but now <hi>Goths,</hi> brought over into the <hi>Roman</hi> soil a very great multitude of Men, who had been thrust out of their Native Country for the sake of Religion: that the Nation of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> formerly embraced the Christian Faith, on the following Occasion. When <hi>Valerianus</hi> and <hi>Gallienus,</hi> were Emperors, a vast multitude of <hi>Scythians</hi> living beyond <hi>Ister,</hi> Cross'd that River into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and by their Excursions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested a great part of <hi>Europe.</hi> After that having sailed over (<hi>the Hellespont</hi>) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Asia,</hi> they invaded <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> And having made very many Captives, among whom were some of the Clergy, they returned into their own Country with much prey. Wherefore those Captives and Holy Men, thus mixt with the Barbarians, brought over not a few of them, unto true Piety
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30465:71"/>
and Godliness, and perswaded them, that instead of the Gentile Superstition they would embrace the Christian Religion. Of the number of those Cap. tives were the Ancestors of <hi>Ulphilas.</hi> This <hi>Ulphilas,</hi> therefore was the Leader of those Holy Men, who lately came out of <hi>Gothia</hi> (or <hi>Scythia</hi>) and was their first Bishop constituted after this manner. When by the King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> he was sent Embassador with some others, unto the Emperor <hi>Constantine,</hi> he was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and other Bishops with him, Bishop of those, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christians in <hi>Gothia,</hi> and were now past over the River <hi>Danube</hi> into the Empire this multitude of Refugees, the Emperor plac'd in <hi>Maesia,</hi> that is, on the <hi>Roman</hi> side and Bank of <hi>Ister.</hi>
                  </q> There is nothing more Material in this story, as 'tis delivered by <hi>Philostorgius.</hi> Upon this passage then, I observe as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Philostorgius</hi> was by the Ancients noted for an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, Lying, and Impious Historian: and therefore his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Photius Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liothec.</hi> ch. 40. p. 26.</note> not easily to be credited, especially in the matter now before us. <hi>Philostorgius'</hi>s business was, to advance the Name and reputation of <hi>Ulphilas</hi> (being a profess'd <hi>Arian,</hi> as well as himself was) and therefore he remembers that <hi>Constantine,</hi> called him <hi>Moses,</hi> and caused him to be Ordained the first Bishop of the Christian <hi>Scythians</hi> or <hi>Goths.</hi> The latter of which, I shall by and by shew is not true, not in the sense <hi>Blondel</hi> would have it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>Philostorgius</hi> in the foresaid Relation, is singular and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, none of the Ecclesiastical Historians before or after him, making any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the things related concerning <hi>Ulphilas:</hi> and this is enough to bring him into suspicion, when he commends <hi>Ulphilas,</hi> as the first Bishop of the <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Scythian</hi> Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Not to insist on either of the former Observations, but allowing <hi>Philostorgius,</hi> to be a faithful Historian, and taking the matter of Fact as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I farther note, that <hi>Philostorgius</hi> speaks of <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> in General carried, into Captivity, not mentioning the particular Species. So that among the Captivated Clergy-Men, there might be Bishops, and there might not be Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, for any thing <hi>Philostorgius</hi> has said, or Mr. <hi>O.</hi> can tell. It is not to be gathered from him, that <hi>Ulphilas</hi> himself was so much as a Presbyter, when he first went unto <hi>Constantine. Jeroms</hi> Adversaries therefore might with as much Truth, and for the Honour of Deacons have hence concluded, that the Power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Ordination was in the Hands of Deacons in <hi>Scythia,</hi> for these 70 Years, as <hi>Blundel</hi> could make his Inference for Presbyters. The most probable Conjecture is, that there were some of all sorts, <hi>sc.</hi> Bishops Priest and Deacons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I might demand of Mr. <hi>O.</hi> to prove that there was any one Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among those Christian Captives, which haply, he will be put hard to do, but in the mean while I'll undertake to demonstrate, that there was at least one Bishop in <hi>Scythia,</hi> before <hi>Ulphilas,</hi> viz. <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who was one of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, and subscribed the Canons of that Council, so <hi>Eusebius</hi> Witnesseth — <hi>also the Bishop of</hi> Persis <hi>was present at the Synod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eus.</hi> l. 3. <hi>Vit. Con.</hi> c. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>nor was there wanting a</hi> Scythian <hi>Bishop. Socrates</hi> names him — <hi>Theophilus who being Bishop of the</hi> Goths, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> there present subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>the</hi> Nicene-<hi>Council. Theophilus</hi> therefore was Bishop of the <hi>Goths</hi> before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, and was present at the Council and subscribed it.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:30465:71"/>
Therefore the power of Ordination, and the Government of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Church was not in the Hands of Presbyters among the Christian <hi>Goths</hi> (or <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>) for about 70 Years, as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> and <hi>Blondel</hi> have affirmed, but in the Hands of Bishops, or of a Bishop at least. I add, that seeing we find a Bishop among the <hi>Goths</hi> before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, 'tis but reasonable to think that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or a Bishop at first went along with the Captive Christians into <hi>Scythia,</hi> or that one soon followed them thither.

                        </gap>,</hi> we will being hereby furnished with a stronger Weapon justifie our Cause: For they who make to themselves a Bishop their Superior, who dare deny them a Power of Ordaining Presbyters, which are but their equals.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Argument is grounded upon a Supposition, which is not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of nor can be proved. <hi>Blondel</hi> takes it here for granted, the <hi>Scythian</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Ordained their Bishops, <hi>Theophilus</hi> for instance. But one may surmize several other things with equal probabilty, any of which will overthrow this wonderful Demonstration. As 1. It may be supposed that a Bishop, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> at their irruption into <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed Captives into <hi>Scythia,</hi> as was before observed; or 2. That some Bishop might follow the Captive Christians into that Barbarous Country, being first Ordained in the Empire. <hi>Theophilus</hi> (which is a Greek Name) haply was so made and Ordained their Bishop, or 3. the <hi>Scythian</hi> Church might send one of their own Presbyters to be Ordained by the Imperial Bishops, as <hi>Ulphilas</hi> after was. For that there was a Correspondence between the <hi>Scythian</hi> and Imperial Churches is past doubt, when we consider that <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> assisted at the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> There is nothing in <hi>Philostorgius</hi> the only Author of this Tale, that thwarts any one of thesethree suppositions, or that Countenances <hi>Blondel'</hi>s surmises of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Presbyters Ordaining their own Bishop. That of <hi>Ulphilas</hi> being the first Bishop, I have already accounted for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the <hi>Scythian</hi> Presbyters Ordained a Bishop to preside over them (suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this) it hence follows they thought it necessary to have one: and rather then have none chosen in their necessity, to constitute and Ordain him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves contrary to the Ordinary and established Method, of which they could not be ignorant.</p>
               <p>But this is said upon a bare supposition of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Presbyters Ordaining their Bishops, which is not proved nor at all probable, as I have shewed before. That which appears above board is, that the <hi>Scythians</hi> had a Bishop, which, setting apart meer Conjectures on both sides, is sufficient to my purpose.</p>

               <p>THE Occasion of their Institution, as I conjecture, was either 1. To promote and quicken Conversions in the Countries and Villages subject to the City Bishops: or 2. After believers and Congregations were there mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed to be as Suffragans, and Assistants for the better Government of the Churches. And because it was a Fundamental Law in the Church, that there ought not to be two Bishops in one Diocess, with plentitude of Power (it being
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30465:72"/>
impossible to serve two Masters) therefore these <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There is not any Monument of Antiquity, that I am aware of, from whence we may better understand the Nature of these <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> than the Canon of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which I will therefore transcribe at length into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>They who reside in Villages and in the Country, or are<note place="margin">Can. 10. Ant.</note> called <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> although Ordained by Bishops, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Holy Synod that they know their own Measures, and govern the Churches subjected to them, and rest content with that care and Administration; that they constitute Readers Subdeacons and Exorcists, and be satisfy'd with this Power, not daring to Ordain a Presbyter or Deacon, without the express consent of the Bishop of the City, unto which both he (the <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi>) and the Country belong. But let the Country Bishop be under the Bishop of the City, to which he is Subject.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the main Question is, whether these <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were real Bishops Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to and distinguished from Presbyters, and in whom was lodged the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Character and Power. The Affirmative is proved by the following Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I consider, that the Title of Bishop and the Power of Ordaining Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was then acknowledged to be in 'em, which I can never be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, would have been granted them at that time of Day, if they were meer Presbyters. They were under the same Bishop as the City Presbyters were; How came they to have that Honourable Title bestowed on them, which the City Presbyters had not? Were the Country Presbyters (such the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were according to Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) far more Honourable and better deserving the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Bishop then the City Presbyters were? I can imagine no other reason of this, but because they had received the true stamp and Character of Bishops, had an inherent habitual Power to do whatever any Diocesan could, and more than any meer Presbyter was able to do: Only as yet they were not Diocesan Bishops, having no Independent Diocesses of their own to Govern, and by consequence were under some limitations, which Diocesans were not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I remember that by the same Conncil of <hi>Antioch,</hi> they were<note place="margin">Can. 7th</note> allowed to give Pacifick Letters to the Clergy to go into other Diocesses, which in those Days the Bishops only could do, and which was one of the Episcopal Prerogatives.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again the 10th Canon of <hi>Antioch</hi> decrees, that the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> although they had received imposition of Hands by Bishops, may not dare to Ordain a Presbyter or Deacon: the obvious meaning whereof is, that although the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were Ordained Bishops; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they might not Ordain Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters or Deacons without leave from the Diocesan. If a <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> received the real Character or Power of a Bishop, he might be apt to think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with himself, that he might Ordain Presbyters and Deacons, as well as the Diocesan being of the same Order with him. No says the Canon: And the Reason of this Prohibition is manifest, because at present he acted only as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister and Assistant in anothers Diocess, where he might not exert his Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Power without Licence from the Diocesan, nor could do it without Breach of the Peace and Order of the Church: We have something of this kind even
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30465:73"/>
among our selves at this day. A Diocesan Bishop out of his own Diocess, and whilst he abides in another Mans, can't Ordain Presbyters and Deacons without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the proper Bishop: and something of this Nature I find in the 18th Canon of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> where a Presbyter being supposed to be Ordained Bishop for another Diocess, but rejected is permitted to return to his former Post, but still to as be a Presbyter though retaining his Episcopal Honour and Character: One may then be a real Bishop, and have the habitual Power and Intrinsick Character of a Bishop, and yet can't put forth the Act and Ordain in anothers Diocess. There is no reason he should; it would breed Confusion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were real Bishops, because they had an equal Right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to assist, vote, decree, and confirm Canons at Councils as Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had. Divers of them subscribed the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> It must be confess'd that meer Presbyters did so likewise, but it was in the Name and stead of their Principals, as their very subscriptions shew. Thus <hi>Vito</hi> (or <hi>Victor</hi>) and <hi>Vincenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Presbyters, and Pope <hi>Sylvester'</hi>s Legates, subscribed the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, yet added to their common Names, <hi>Romanus</hi> or <hi>Roma missus:</hi> So in the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Anno 419. two <hi>Roman</hi> Presbyters and Legates of the Pope did — <hi>Philippus</hi> Presbyter, <hi>Legatus Ecclesiae</hi> Romanae, <hi>Asellus</hi> Presbyter, <hi>Legatus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae</hi> Romanae. But the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> subscribed in their own Names, without mentioning any Delegation at all, and therefore acted by their own proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Authority, and by consequence were real Bishops.</p>
               <p>Having (I presume) proved, that the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> had the True Episcopal Character impress'd on them, I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plea</hi> p. 141.</note> what advantage Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would make of 'em. In the first place from the 10th Canon of <hi>Ant. A. D.</hi> 344 (or 341) he lays it down that — <hi>the</hi> Chorepiscopi <hi>or Country Bishops Ordained Presbyters, until they were restrained by that Canon.</hi> I agree with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> so far, that 'tis very likely, the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> presumed to Ordain Presbyters in another Bishop's Diocess, until they were prohibted by this Canon. It was necessary, they should be restrained for the peace and good Order of the Church, from having an uncontroulable Liberty of Ordaining in another Bishops Diocess, and without his consent. The rule is highly reasonable and observed to this Day. However this be, the Canon will do Mr. <hi>O.</hi> no service, if the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were real Bishops, and more than Presbyters, of which I have already produced sufficient proof. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain Mr. <hi>O.</hi> gathers, that if these <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were Bishops, then it appears that Bishops were made not only in Cities, but in Country villages. This I grant also unto Mr. <hi>O.</hi> but it nothing concerns the Matter in Hand. We must Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Diocesan Bishops, whose seat and Principal Church was oft-times in Villages, and the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> who were not Diocesans, but the <hi>Comministri</hi> and <hi>Vicarii</hi> of the City Bishops. Now how far the Delegated Power of a <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> extended, no one alive can tell at this Day. 'Tis nothing likely, that it was confined to one Village only, as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> contends, though haply his Ordinary Residence, and particular care might be in some Country-Town, where he discharged the Ordinary Duty of a Presbyter, and on that score may be accounted as a Country Presbyter under the City Bishop; such at this day is even a Diocesan Bishop, who is by <hi>Commendam</hi> possest of a Rectory in anothers Diocess. He can Act there but as a Presbyter, except he has leave from the proper Bishop. For ought any thing then that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> says or pretends to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30465:73"/>
prove, the delegated Power of a <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> reach'd to more than one or half a dozen Villages.</p>
               <p>Well! Mr. <hi>O.</hi> goes on and tells us, that — <q>The Country Villages, where the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> were fixt, were but thinly Peopled with Christians, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority or at least great Numbers of the People being Heathens, by which, (<hi>he adds</hi>) we may guess at the bigness of Primitive Diocesses, which were scarce as large as our lesser Parishes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here are divers things supposed and asserted, but none proved. 1. 'Tis sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that the <hi>Chorepiscopus'</hi>s Power, was confined to one Village or Country Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish only; this ought to be made out by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 2. 'Tis asserted, that these Country Villages were thinly Peopled with Christians, but that is more then Mr. <hi>O.</hi> knows; and the contrary is more probable, <hi>so.</hi> that they abounded with Christians now in the Reign of <hi>Constantius,</hi> Son of <hi>Constantine, the Great,</hi> when that Council of <hi>Antioch</hi> was held, and from whence Mr. <hi>O.</hi> makes the Deduction. Besides 'tis likely, that a <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> was never made, but where the Christians were Numerous. In short, how, thin soever particular Villages were of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet there being many, very many Villages, all of them having some Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and a Power over them being committed to the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> this note of Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s is not very much to the purpose. But however from the Premises he Collects 4. <hi>That we may thence guess at the bigness of Primitive Diocesses, which were scarce as large as our lesser Parishes.</hi> Something of this Nature might perhaps be conjectured, if all Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has asserted without proof, and overlook'd without Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination were true. But I ask whether this be not an intolerable piece of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to intimate at this rate, that these Country Villages were seperate, and independent Diocesses, when as 'tis manifest from the very Canon, that they were Appendages of the City Diocess, and<note place="margin">10. Of <hi>Ant.</hi>
                  </note> subject to the City Bishop. Here then instead of a small Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Bishoprick, we have found as large a Diocess, haply as ours are at this Day.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> proceeds and affirms, <q>That the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> are an instance of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, without subject Presbyters; they were but Parish Bishops, under Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bishops.</q> Say then a <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> had the charge of one only single Village or particular Congregation, specially allotted to him, which at this day, we call a Parish (admitting this): yet it follows not, that he was a Bishop without subject Presbyters: probably he had some district of the Diocess com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his particular care and inspection. The Canon of <hi>Antioch</hi> seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate thus much — <q>It seemed good to the Synod, that the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> govern the Churches (<hi>in the plural</hi>) subject to them, and to content themselves with this care and sollicitude of constituting Readers.</q> But granting they had no subject Presbyters, but acted Ordinarily as Parish Presbyters: yet they were real Bishops, and ready upon occasion to discharge the Diocesans Office, when required, which Prebyters could not. Morever if these <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> were only Presbyters and Bishops of a small Congregation (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) why was the caution given them against Ordaining Presbyters and Deacons, except it was for other Parishes or Churches? For surely they did not Ordain Presbyters and Deacons for themselves. If they did, even so they must have had Presbyters subject to them. In short, they had doubtless a delegated
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30465:74"/>
Power from the City or Diocesan Bishop, to Ordain Presbyters and Deacons. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But 'tis observable what is after added, <hi>as for those</hi> (Chorepiscopi) <hi>who have been already made, the former</hi> Canons of <hi>Ancyra</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> must be observed by them, <hi>that they do nothing without the Consent of the City Bishop.</hi> Where we see plainly a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> is given unto that Order of the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> for the future. Nor is this alteration to be wondered at. For the making the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> or Vicarious Bishops in the Country, belonging to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Diocess was meerly an Ecclesiastical Constitution, and by the same Power that it was introduced it might again be annulled. I observe moreover, that the 2d clause above mentioned, which still reserves to the former <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> their Power, which had been committed to them by the City Bishops, shews that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some Character, which a Council could not deprive them of. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the Power of the former <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> might have been Abrogated as well as the Order its self, intirely dissolved for the future. The occasion of this change made by the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Fathers doubtless was, that they had by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence found some inconveniences and disorders, happening through these <hi>Chorepis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi,</hi> who it may be could never be hindred from Ordaining Presbyters and Deacons, in other Bishops Diocefses contrary to all Order and good Rule.

They speak not of Presbyters, that is, not in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and expresly of them alone, as is manifeft to any one, that has his Eyes in his Head: but only in General of such as had not been engaged in the <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Schism. These surely must be Bishops, as well as Presbyters or Deacons. The truth is, they include all the Three Orders, and thats the reason in this whole Epistle, they Name no one of them expresly, meaning to confirm them all (as well Bishops as Presbyters, that had stuck close to <hi>Alexander</hi>) in their Ancient Respective Powers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </gap>,</hi> and that it had been an <hi>Ancient Custom,</hi> that is, long before <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> yea, before <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Achillas.</hi> Thus much being said for the right understanding of that Letter of the <hi>Nicence</hi> Fathers, let us now proceed to examine what Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has inferred from the last mentioned passage, according to Mr. <hi>Baxter'</hi>s Lamentable Translation of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> argues — <q>If any say the meaning is, that these Presbyters shall Ordain and govern with Bishops, but not with out them, it is granted. For the decree refers to the <hi>Ecclesiastica Instituta;</hi> but this sheweth, that Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongeth to the Presbyters Office, and consequently is no nullity, tho' an irregularity as to the Canons, when 'tis done by them alone.</q> His meaning is (as I take him) that Presbyters have an Inherent and Intrinsick power to Ordain, but that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers had by their Ecclesiastical Constitution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained that power, so that it should not be exerted, but with the Bishops: that when the Presbyter did Ordain without Bishops, 'twas only an irregularity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> breach of the Ecclesiastical Constitution, not a Nullity. But to this I reply.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Nicence</hi> Fathers (as has already been observed) speak not of Presbyter only, but of all the Three Orders Bishops, Priests and Deacons, who are hereby every one of them, allowed to do what properly belong to their own Order, according to the Ancient Custom and Constitution of that Church.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:30465:76"/>2. That therefore supposing their meaning to be (what Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would have it) that Presbyters in particular, according to the Ecclesiastical Constitution, shall Ordain with the Bishops, and not without them, it will not follow, that Ordination by Presbyters alone without Bishops is vallid, and only an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: Because it may with as good Reason be hence concluded, that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters power to Ordain with the Bishops belonged to them, but by Ecclesiastical Constitution only, and not by any inherent Right. There is nothing in this Letter, that argues any thing for their Intrinisick power to Ordain. The most that can be said is, that they had an Ancient Right by Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and Custom to Ordain with Bishops, and if so, then their Ordaining without Bishops was a Nullity, as well as an Irregularity; because they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd that very Law which alone gave them their Power. 3. It is a great mistake, to think every thing established, or rather reinforc'd by Ecclesiastical Constitution, has no better Foundation than that very Ecclesiastical Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Reinforcement. A Divine and Scriptural Law may, and has been often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confirmed and renewed by a Synodical Decree, and subjected to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Penalties. The Lord's-Day, which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will not deny to be Holy by Divine Institution, has been made so by Humane appointment also, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments decreed against those that prophaned it. This is manifest among out selves here in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> Ordained the first Day of the Week for Divine Worship: Shall we say, the Lord's-Day was<note place="margin">

Of the same Nature, are the 38. 41. 42, 49. 50, 51. <hi>&amp;c. Can. Apostol.</hi> The Decree then of the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> hinders not, but that it might have been a Divine Institution, that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Ordain and Govern, only with and under Bishops. And if this be so, as I have formerly (tis hoped) made good, then Presbyters Ordaining without Bishops will prove a Nullity, and contrary to the Divine and Scripture Rule, as well as an Irregularity or contrary to the Ecclesiastical Laws. But how does the Ecclesiastical Constitution shew, that Ordination belongs to the Presbyters Office? His meaning (I suppose) is that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, could not appoint Presbyters to Ordain with Bishops, except the Presbyters had a Prior, and an intrinsick power to Ordain. But I ask, why may not the Synod shew thereby, that the Presbyters intrinsick power (what ever it was) belonged to them only in Conjunction with Bishops? And not separately from 'em. If a Prince Commands the General of his Army to do nothing of Moment, without the advice of the Principal Field-Officers, this shews that the Field-Officers have a Power to Act with the General and under him, but not that they have a power to Act sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and without Him: And if the General or other the Kings Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this part of the Commission to the Field-Officers, they may and ought to Act in Conjunction with their General (for the Commission so appoints); but it would be presumption and Mutiny to Act without the General, which if they presumed to do their Orders would of them selves be Null and invalid. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>O.</hi> must first prove, that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers supposed the Presbyters to have an Intrinsick power to Ordain alone, before he can make out that their separate Ordinations are irregular only, and not invalid in themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:30465:77"/>But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> again argues that — <q>If it be said these (Nicene <hi>Constitutions</hi>) condemn Schismatical Ordinations (<hi>which he grants, yet answers</hi>) that Schism as such cannot make Ordinations Null, though it implys an Irregularity.</q> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I return, that Schism as such does make the Ordination Null. It is Null as to the Exercise of the Office so conferred, though not as to the habitual Power or intrinsick Character given. This seems to have been the very Sense of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, in this their Epistle to the Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The <hi>Melitian</hi> Bishops, because they had been Schismatically Ordained, were suspended from the Exercise of their Office, yet their Character was not declared utterly void and annull'd. There was Room left for their exercising it again upon some certain Conditions, and the Title of Bishop was still continued unto 'em, which could not be, if the Character had been intirely lost or Null.</p>
               <p>Hitherto belongs the Case of <hi>Colluthus</hi> and <hi>Ischyras,</hi> which some Episcopal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have urged against the Validity of Ordination by Presbyters; for, say they, <hi>Ischyras</hi> Ordained by <hi>Colluthus</hi> a Presbyter, is in <hi>Athanasius</hi> constantly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and declared no Presbyter, but a meer <hi>Laic,</hi> and not suffered so much as to have the Honor and Title of Presbyter, as all others of the <hi>Melitian</hi> Schism, Episcopally though Schismatically Ordained were allowed: So the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had decreed. The reason why <hi>Ischyras</hi> was rejected is this, he had been Ordained by a Presbyter only, <hi>viz. Colluthus, Blondel</hi> has taken much pains to perplex this Fact with sundry difficulties, and Objections thrown in our way on purpose to render it useless unto us in the present Controversie: and Mr. <hi>O.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so has made his observations on it. I shall consider them both, and to that end shall in the first place produce the Principal passages, that occur in <hi>Athanasius'</hi>s second Apology relating to the said <hi>Colluthus</hi> and <hi>

               <p>In Answer hereunto, and to evince that this is a Clever Instance in Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against Ordinations by Presbyters, I will reduce the Whole case into three Questions. 1.

               <p>For he is all along called Presbyter, never Bishop, nor Schismatical Bishop: He is described as one, that took upon him the Episcopacy, personated and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

to be what he was not, a Bishop. If he had been a real,<note place="margin">Epis. ad Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rlosum.</note> though Schismatically Ordained Bishop, he could not have been said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to have Acted the part of a Bishop, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys, he was not really one. No body ever called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Here lies the Knavery: For 'tis not <hi>Colluthus,</hi> but <hi>Caluthus,</hi> who is mentioned in the <hi>Breviculum.</hi> And least this should be thought a mistake in Writing or in Printing, I undertake to prove beyond all Contradiction, that they were different Persons however, if not different in Name also. For 'tis granted by <hi>Blundel,</hi> and in its self manifest, that our <hi>Colluthus</hi> died before the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> broke up, or <hi>Alexander</hi> returned into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and demanded of <hi>Melitius</hi> this <hi>Breviculum.</hi> But the <hi>Caluthus</hi> named in the <hi>Breviculum,</hi> when <hi>Melitius</hi> brought it to <hi>Alexander,</hi> now returned from <hi>Nice</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> was then alive: So it follows in <hi>Athanasius,</hi> immediately after the <hi>Breviculum</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. These Persons then present, <hi>Melitius</hi> brought unto <hi>Alexander</hi> the Bishop. So that, as the Accusers of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> pretended he had Killed <hi>Arsenius,</hi> though <hi>Arsenius</hi> was then alive: Even so by a contrary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, <hi>Blundel</hi> will have our <hi>Colluthus</hi> alive: Though he was already Dead, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever then were Ordained by our <hi>Colluthus,</hi> were Ordained by a meer Presbyter.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> That he was no Presbyter is so often affirmed, that we need not trouble our selves to enquire farther into that matter. However, that he was Ordained by <hi>Colluthus</hi> (because <hi>Blundel</hi> is inclined to believe not) will require a little proof. And 1.

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. 3. Whether <hi>Ischycas</hi> was declared a meer <hi>Laic,</hi> either because not Ordained at all, or because Schismatically Ordained, or else because he was Ordained by a Presbyter only, <hi>viz. Colluthus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It having been proved, that <hi>Colluthus</hi> was no Bishop, that <hi>Ischyras</hi> was Ordained by him, at least supposed by the Synod of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to have been Ordained by him, the first part of the Question is at an end, it was not because he had not been Ordained at all; and then I affirm he became a <hi>Laic,</hi> not simply because he was Schismatically Ordained, but because he was Ordained by a Presbyter, who had no competent power to Ordain at all. For 1. <hi>Colluthus</hi> is ever called Presbyter (not once Bishop or Schismatical Bishop that I find) or barely <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> or Catholick Presbyter, or one that counterfeited himself a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, as in the Synodical Letter of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fathers, and by the Presbyters and Deacons at <hi>Mareota.</hi> They all then looked upon <hi>Ischyras</hi> as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by a Presbyter, and for that reason his Ordination Null. For so 2. It is expresly recorded, <hi>Colluthus died a Prebyter, therefore all his Ordinations were void, and all Ordained by him in the Schism were reduced into the Order of</hi> Laics, says the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical Letter of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fathers. <hi>Ischyras was no Presbyter, for he was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Catholick Presbyter</hi> Colluthus; <hi>so that by consequence all Ordained by him went back into their former place, and</hi> Ischyras <hi>appeared a</hi> Laic, say the Presbyters, and Deacons at <hi>Mareota.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will be objected, that the Words in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Synod are — <hi>all Ordained by</hi> Colluthus <hi>in Schism became</hi> Laics, implying by those Words <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Schism,</hi> that therefore his Ordinations were void, not because <hi>Colluthus</hi> was a Presbyter, but because his Ordinations were Schismatical.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is very true in Fact, that all <hi>Colluthus</hi> his Ordinations were Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, yet this was not the proper and immediate reason of their Nullity; but only mentioned as a Circumstance which aggravated his Crime, the True Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being assigned in the former Clause of that Period — <hi>Colluthus being a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter died, therefore all his Ordinations were void,</hi> viz. because he died a Presbyter, and for the same reason those Ordained by him were meer <hi>Laicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Schism, if it was one reason of the Nullity of <hi>Colluthus</hi> his Ordinations, yet it was not the only one: For another was, because <hi>Colluthus</hi> died a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:30465:79"/>3. I do confess the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fathers, prosecuted the <hi>Melitians</hi> with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Rigor, declaring all their Ordinations without exception utterly void; so that such as were Schismatically Ordained, were Universally Commanded to be what they were before. But the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers came to a better Temper, and in some Degree confirmed the Schismatical Ordinations, that is, such as were meerly Schismatical: And yet <hi>Ischyras</hi> was not permitted to tast of this favour? Why so? Why, because there was another fatal blot in his <hi>Escocheon,</hi> which could never be wiped out, <hi>viz.</hi> He had been Ordained by a Presbyter only.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a great mistake to think that Schism must needs be understood of the breach of the Ecclesiastical Laws only. There is Schism in departing from some Scripture or Divine Rules, which not immediatly appertaining to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals and Essence of Religion, denominates the Persons not Apostates or Hereticks, but Erroneous and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> only. If any of the believers at <hi>Antioch,</hi> had presumed to eat Blood contrary to the Apostolical Decree concluded on at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he had been doubtless a Schismatick. Thus we reckon the Dissenters Schismaticks, as departing from the Divine Apostolical Constitution of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. <hi>Colluthus</hi> a Presbyter Ordaining <hi>Ischyras</hi> did it in Schism, true! but 'twas such a Schism as contravened a Divine Law, and so the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fathers thought for any thing I see to the contrary, when they condemned his Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Ordinations as Null in themselves. For surely that which is done against a Divine Law, (and such is Schismatical Ordination, Schism being a Work of the Flesh) is in its self Null and of no Effect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ought to distinguish between the Law its self, and the Censures of the Church declared against the breach of that Law. The Law may be of Divine Appointment, though the Censure is meerly Ecclesiastical. St. <hi>Paul</hi> has given us a Canon, that a Bishop ought not to be a <hi>striker:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 3.</note> But Deposition for this fault is purely Ecclesiastical, not an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Penalty. In like manner a Presbyter (as <hi>Colluthus</hi>) Ordaining without the Bishop, and for that cause being deposed, the fault was committed against a Divine Law, though the punishment was Ecclesiastical. 'Twere foolish and absurd to conclude, that Ordination by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was only a Canonical Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, because a Synod declares it Null: Or that <hi>Ischyras</hi> his Ordination was only irregular &amp; uncanonical not unscriptural, because his Deposition was decreed by the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Synod. As it is not the verdict of the Jury, nor the Sentence of the Judge, nor the Execution of the Criminal, which properly and in intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Justice makes him a Murtherer, but the Murther its self committed; so 'tis not a Synod's Solemn Declaration, which is purely Ecclesiastical, but the Schism its self or a Violation of some Scripture. Law that makes him a Schismatick, and subjects him to Ecclesiastical Punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blundel</hi> himself suspecting (as I believe) that the Whole Fabrick; which he had with so much Artifice, and Subtlety here raised in Opposition to us, would not stand, is therefore content at least to grant that — <q>
                     <hi>Ischyras</hi> was for this one reason accounted a <hi>Laic,</hi> because he was Ordained by a Presbyter, by <hi>Colluthus</hi> a Presbyter: But says it does not hence follow that Bishops alone had power given them by the Apostles to Ordain, or that Presbyters werenot Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally invested with that Power: And he adds, that nevertheless, Ordination by Presbyters was only a Violation of the Ecclesiastical Constitution, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:30465:79"/>
to confirm from numerous Instances of Ecclesiastical Canons, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, were sometimes deposed for Canonical Irregularities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is a sorry shift and unworthy so Learned a Man; for on the other side, I am able to produce several Canons, and have already produced enough, the matter of which Canons is grounded on Scripture, though reinforced by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Penalties. It will not follow then, that because the Ecclesiastical Canons forbid Presbyters to Ordain (reserving that Power to Bishops) upon pain of Deposition or Deprivation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore this was not a Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, but Ecclesiastical only. For at this rate <hi>Blondel</hi> might pretend the 27th Canon Apostolical, the matter of which is, <hi>that a Bishop must not be a striker,</hi> is a meer Ecclesiastical Constitution, which yet we know is one of St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. Though at the same time we must confess that the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which is the Penalty annex'd is purely Ecclesiastical. The matter of some Church Canons is often purely Ecclesiastical as well as the Penalty; but it will not follow that all are so. For as the Prince frequently causes old Laws to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, reinforceing them by Proclamation, so have Synods done with Ancient Scripture Laws and Rules. In this Case the King makes not new Laws, nor the Synods new Ecclesiastical Canons. The Primitive Christians were wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and propound unto the Church the belief of the great Fundamental and Essential Articles of Christianity, as that of the Trinity against the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and that of Grace against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> upon pain<note place="margin">See Cod. Ec. Afr. apud Just.</note> of Deposition or Excommunication; We must not hence infer that these were only Canonical not Scripture Truths, because others of their Definitions were so. In short the Tryal of the Subject matter of Church Canons, whether Divine or purely Ecclesiastial will depend on the Scripture chiefly. Thither we are to resort for satisfaction, and not fancy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has been reinforced by Canon is meerly Canonical. We have 'tis hoped al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready thence clear'd that point about Episcopal Ordination: That which properly belongs to us here, is to prove it to have been the Principle and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church in the beginning of the Fourth Century, when the <hi>Alexand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Synods were Assembled, which we think also is hitherto made good.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Blondel</hi> goes on: <q>
                     <hi>Ischyras</hi> was deposed by the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is what we utterly deny, and is indeed a Meer quirk, no better than fooling. <hi>Ischyras</hi> and many others were not properly deposed, but only declared no Presbyters, as being Ordained by a Presbyter, which may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be gathered from the Expressions used in the foresaid Synodical Epistles. concerning such as <hi>Colluthus</hi> had Ordained, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Ischyras</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> denote no more. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Synod of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> complained, how the <hi>Eusebians</hi> caused <hi>Ischy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> to be called Bishop, they aggravated the Insolence in these Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whereas he was not so<note place="margin">Ep. Synod. Hier.</note> much as a Presbyter, <hi>viz.</hi> at that very time; that's to say,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30465:80"/>
When <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> was alive and in some Credit, and when the <hi>Eusebians</hi> gave him out for a Bishop, before the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Synod was assembled, or had declared him a <hi>Laic,</hi> even then he was not so much as a Presbyter. So that he was a meer <hi>Laic</hi> in the Nature of the thing, and before the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fathers had so pronounced him. Nor do I see any impropriety in saying <hi>Ischyras</hi> (tho' no Presbyter) was deposed. For though he was really no Presbyter as being Ordained by a Presbyter only, yet he took upon him the Office and Title of Presbyter, supported and upheld himself by Stilts, by Confidence and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy: He was believed a Presbyter by many, and by many countenanced and kept up as such. Now though a Man lying prostrate on the floor can't be Knock'd down, <hi>qui jacet in terrâ non habet unde cadat;</hi> yet he who stands on Crutches or is held up by others, 'tis not absurd to say, He may be Knock'd down, which is sufficient to shew the Weakness of <hi>Blondel'</hi>s fancy, And the false Colours put on this Argument.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Blundel</hi> gives it yet a siner Turn thus — <q>It was usual in that Age (says he) to reduce real Bishops and Presbyters, transgressing the Canons of the Church, <hi>ad Laicam Communionem:</hi> and yet it cannot be deny'd, but they had been real Bishops.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is very true: But is just such another piece of Sophistry as before, and reaches not the Merits of the Cause. For 1. this will not evince that ever <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> was a Presbyter, though some real Presbyters for Crimes proved upon them were allowed only Lay-Communion. He has not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us that they were declared meer <hi>Laics:</hi> They were only suspended from performing the Office of Presbyters, and admitted to Lay-Communion, their Character still (as I may say) lying dormant in them. If any such Instance were to be found, it can't thence be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that <hi>Ischyras</hi> also was so dealt with. 'Tis absurd to argue from one or a few particular Instances, unto all others or to any other single Case, especially which differs from them. For 'tis one thing to misdemean ones self in an Office, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to counterfeit it. The former is deprived from performing, what he is orherwise rightly qualify'd for, the latter is not what he pretends to be. The instance of the former kind is of a pure Ecclesiastical Punishment, whereas the latter labours under a defect and Error of the first Concoction which in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing annuls all his following Ministerial Acts, he having never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Power, which he pretends to. Though therefore a Real Presbyter is for his misbehaviour sometimes condemn'd to Lay-Communion, yet the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension taken of, as he once was, so he again becomes a real Presbyter to all intents and purposes. 'Tis no good Consequence hence drawn that a Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Presbyter (such was <hi>Ischyras</hi>) who is declared a meer <hi>Laic,</hi> must needs have been a Presbyter: Neither will it follow that he, who has usurp'd the Seat of a Presbyter, from whence he is thrust down and deposed, was ever a real Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For a Man may well enough be said to be deposed from an Office which he usurps and discharges for a while, but never had a Right and Title to. A Real King, though deposed was once a real King; that's undeniable; but one that personates and is called a King, and Acts all the parts of the Royal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for a time, must be acknowledged never to have been a real King. 'Twas <hi>Ischyras</hi> his Case, He Acted the part of a Presbyter, and was afterwards Kick'd off the Stage, shall it hence be concluded He was once a real Presbyter? Under <hi>Blondel'</hi>s favour I think not. But</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:30465:80"/>Let us see now what Mr. <hi>O.</hi> (who has a Knack at improving Arguments) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> offered about the Case of <hi>Ischyras.</hi> He acknowledges <hi>Colluthus</hi> was but a pretended Bishop, and therefore was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note place="margin">Plea. <hi>p.</hi> 181.</note> by the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Council to be a Presbyter. I am of this Mind, and 'tis all I demand should be grantedme. The Reader of himself will discern hereby, that he has given up the Whole Cause. But perhaps Mr. <hi>O.</hi> means, that <hi>Colluthus</hi> pretending to be a Bishop, though he was not one, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that false Colour to Ordain, therefore not his Power of Ordaining as a Presbyter was called in Question, but his Dissimulation in taking upon him to be what he was not, was condemned, and so he was publickly declared to be a Presbyter, that is a <hi>pretended</hi> Bishop only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> But I ask then, why was <hi>Ischyras</hi> laid aside as a meer <hi>Laic?</hi> Surely, not because his Ordainer falsly assumed the Character of Bishop, which belonged not to him. But then (say I) is it not hard my Ordainers Dissimulation (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing him otherwise to have the Power) should annul my Orders. But <hi>Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> his Ordinations were vacated, not because he pretended to be a Bishop and was not, but because he was a Presbyter without Power to Ordain.</p>
               <p>Well! But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> tells us, <q>
                     <hi>Ischyras'</hi>s Ordination was declared void as being not acknowledged by the Authors, <hi>Colluthus</hi> belike not owning he had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Ischyras:</hi> So that it not appearing, 'twas taken for granted, He was never Ordained, and so He became a <hi>Laic,</hi> no Presbyter; not because he was Ordained by a Presbyter, but for want of any Ordination, that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> The meaning of all which (as I apprehend) is that the instance makes nothing against Ordination by Presbyters, seeing here was no Ordination at all, <hi>Ischyras'</hi>s Ordainers not owning, that they had imposed hands on him.</p>
               <p>For answer hereunto I referr the Reader to what is above replyed unto something of this kind: The sum whereof is that <hi>Ischyras</hi> was either really Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by <hi>Colluthus</hi> the Presbyter, or at least by his Judges taken for such, which is the same thing.</p>
               <p>As for Dr. <hi>Field'</hi>s Argument (his Authority I meddle not with) cited by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in these Words, <hi>Presbyters Ordinations were accounted void by the Rigor of the Canons in use then, because Ordinations</hi> sine Titulo <hi>were Null, Concil. Chalced. Can.</hi> 6. it belongs not to the time we are now speaking of, the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> being Held an Hundred and twenty Years after that of <hi>Nice:</hi> Nor was the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Title required till long after that Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> wherein also I meet not with a Syllable of annulling Ordinations for want of a Title. That 6th Can. makes void Clancular Ordinations not given visibly in the Face of the Church, the Rule, which required the Candidate to be offered unto the suffrage of the Clergy, and People in the Churches and Congregation, being neglected, as <hi>Justellus</hi> has observed from the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The method of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Titles indeed grew up afterwards, which the Canonists in the following Ages gathered from this sixth Canon of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as fancying some Analogy or Agreement between them in Reason as <hi>Calvin</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See his <hi>Lexic. Jurid.</hi>
                  </note> teaches me. However let us take the Argument as 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. <hi>Ordinations by Presbyters were accounted void not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but by the Rigor of the Canons in use then:</hi> How does this appear? Why, <hi>because Ordinations</hi> sine Titulo <hi>were null by the sixth Canon of</hi> Chalcedon, which is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:30465:81"/>
just as if one should pretend to prove the Lord's-Day not Holy by Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment but by the Ecclesiastical Constitution, because the other Holy-Days are not. Is it not possible the Lord's-Day may be Holy by Divine Institution, though <hi>Good Friday</hi> is not? Or that Ordinations by Presbyters may be Null in themselves and by Scripture, though Ordinations <hi>sine Titulo</hi> be uncanonical on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? But, if Mr. <hi>O.</hi> intended this only as the Judgment of so Learned a Person as <hi>Dr. Field,</hi> I let it pass as such, being no ways obliged to account for the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of private Doctors.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Author of <hi>the Naked Truth</hi> (if I rightly apprehend Mr. <hi>O.</hi> for I lift not to look after the Book its self) intends to prove by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non (<hi>which forbids Bishops to Ordain in one anothers Diocesses</hi>) <hi>that the Irregular Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations by Bishops are as Null, as the irregular Ordinations by Presbyters.</hi> Now there is no strength in this Reasoning. I can scarce allow it to be sense. He ought first to make out, that Presbyters have power to Ordain, and then indeed the irregular Ordinations of the one would be Null as well as of the other and both alike: But we deny Presbyters to have Power to Ordain (be sure That <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon gives them none) and therefore the Comparison here is foolish and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. 'Tis as if one should lay down this grave <hi>Maxim — the Irregular Sentence of a Judge is as Null, as that of a private Man,</hi> whereas a private Man can give no decretory Sentence at all. I own Bishops in their Ordinations were under many Canonical Restraints, and some of their irregular Ordinations were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed Null, at least so as that the Ordained, were not allowed to exercise their Function. But to talk of the Irregularities of Ordinations by Presbyters is to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it proved they have Power to Ordain, which is to beg the Question. I am sure their power is not intimated in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons (as that of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops is) nor in any other that I am yet acquainted with. If a Canon were any where to be found restraining Ordinations made by Presbyters, and limiting the manner and circumstances of 'em, 'twere reasonable thence to gather that Presbyters had Power to Ordain: But the Canonical Restraints laid upon Bishops will not convince me that Presbyters had that Power. Finally one may by the same Reasoning conclude that Deacons, yea, that every Ordinary believer had power to Ordain, as well as Bishops. Thus I proceed in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument — <hi>By the</hi> Nicene <hi>Canons, Bishops Ordinations in others Diocesses without consent are forbid, and hence we see, the irregular Ordinations of Bishops are as Null as the irregular Ordinations of Ordinary believers and Deacons:</hi> But this is no better than beating the Air, out of nothing to gather something. For all this while neither Deacons nor Believers have power at all to Ordain. Haply Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has left the Reverend Authors Argument short: So I dismiss it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I do suppose the same Person or Persons (whosoever they were) wrote these <hi>Commentaries and Questions. Blondel</hi> Himself is of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and so is <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his Observations on <hi>Ambrose'</hi>s<note place="margin">Ap. Sect. 2. ch. 22. p. 59.</note> Works. 2. I also Judge they were written long after <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> yea, after <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi> by some ignorant, idle and knavlsh Fellow, who mixed truth and falshood, good and bad together, Collecting some Notions out of the Fathers, and adding many of his own silly conceits. The Testimonies which I have spoken of were its likely collected out of <hi>Austin:</hi> The Discourse, about the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Quaest. 101.</note> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Deacons, exalting themselves above Presbyters was borrowed from <hi>Jerom'</hi>s Epistle to <hi>Evagrius.</hi> But to make short Work on it. Let us hear <hi>Erasmus'</hi>s Censure of the Questions. <q>The Author (says he) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats many the same things in several places, propounds the same Questions, and treats of'em over and over again; is not constant in his Opinions: Some scraps out of other Mens Works are often inserted: He repeats what he had said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but in a quite different stile. He is very idle in starting Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he ought not. There is a perfect confusion in the Work. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he writes Commentaries, sometimes Controversie: Sometimes he Preaches, and sometimes disputes very Foolishly and Meerly Prates. He is often Scurrilous and Abusive, and yet has said many things worthy to be read and known, but gathered out of others. He cites not his Authors, he cheats the Reader with counterfeit Titles. By the repetitions and the disorder in his matter he writes of, by his Tumultuous and Womanish Talkativeness he even kills his Reader. The first part seems to be the Work of some Greek affecting to speak Latin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Erasmus</hi> is more favourable to the <hi>Commentaries,</hi> yet confesses the Prefaces are not St. <hi>Ambroses'</hi>s, but some busy and illiterate Fellow tack'd 'em to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries. I make account then these <hi>Commentaries and Questions</hi> are of no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or Authority in any Controversy whatever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The compiler of them has intermixt several things favouring Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and so is <hi>Jack O'</hi> both-sides. 1. He expounds the Angels (spoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10.) Bishops grounding himself on the Revelations: And gives the Reason why <hi>Women ought to be covered in the Church because of the Angels,</hi> that is, Bishops, <hi>quia Episcopus personam habet Christi &amp; vicarius est Domini,</hi> sustains the Person of Christ and is the Vicar of the Lord. The which must be understood of the Days of <hi>Paul:</hi> Else the Explanation is altogether fruitless and impertinent. 2. He resembles the Deacons to the Levites, Presbyters to the Priests, whereof
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:30465:83"/>
one was the High-Priest unto whom the Bishop answers see Question 101. 3. He grants <hi>Timothy</hi> had the Power ofOrdaining committed to him by <hi>Paul</hi> in these. Words, <hi>unde Quemadmodum Episcopum ordinet</hi> Timotheus, <hi>ostendit</hi> Paulus. But he no where expresly allows this to the Presbyters. Many other Observations, if it were worth while, might be Collected out of this Author tending to the same purpose.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He contradicts himself the Holy Scripture, and the most Ancient Writers in the Church. He affirms that at first all might Preach, Baptize and explain Scripture, but after, Churches were Establish'd and Distinct Offices were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the Church began to be govern'd another way, so that no Man should presume to Officiate in Holy things, except he were Ordained. Whereas nothing is more manifest than that there were at the Council of <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 15.</note>, besides, Deacons two Species of Officers at least, Apostles and Elders, to say nothing of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, of whom also we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 15, That when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> there were <hi>set in the Church</hi> by God himself, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The same are to be met with in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> In that to the <hi>Philippians</hi> we read of their Apostle, of their Bishops (or Presbyters,) and their Deacons. <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> had their Elders and Deacons under them. To omit sundry, other examples hereof in Scripture, <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> tells us, that the Lord appointed <hi>who</hi> were to Minister in Divine Offices among the Christians, and <hi>Ignatius</hi> needs not here to be brought in for Evidence. But let us consider the several Instances Mr. <hi>O.</hi> gives in Confirmation of this Paradox, that there were no Ministers in the Church at the beginning.</p>
               <p>The first is of <hi>Philip.</hi> But <hi>Philip</hi> had been Ordained by Imposition of Hands, and besides was a Person endued with extraordinary and supernatural Gifts, that is was a Prophet, and of such I readily grant it true, that they were not strictly and indispensably ty'd to common Rules of Order, but might do what the Spirit moved 'em to. But 'tis remarkable what <hi>Hilary</hi> himself says of <hi>Philip, Evangelistae Diaconi sunt sicut Philippus.</hi> So then here were Ministers thus Early besides the Apostles. As for <hi>Apollos Act.</hi> 18. 24. to pass by other Observations that might be useful, I much question whether, when he preach'd at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he was yet a Christian, or rather am positive he was none: For he <hi>knew only the Baptism of</hi> John, <hi>v.</hi> 25. unto whom therefore <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla, expounded the way of God more perfectly,</hi> v. 26. And tho' after this he still Preach'd at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> v. 28. it may be said that by this time he had been Ordained to it, for any thing appears to the contrary: And we must not think none were Ordained, but such of whom 'tis expresly testify'd in Scripture: We ought rather to conclude all were Ordain'd because many were. Of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> their instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Apollos,</hi> I have shewed elsewhere, that it was private not Ministerial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. In short, I know not one Example of a Person unordained, and of ordinary Gifts only, that took upon him to Preach in any Christian Assemblies, much more to administer the Holy Sacraments; nor can I fancy, when that time was of which <hi>Hilary</hi> speaks, when every Man that would, did Administer in the Word and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:30465:83"/>But the story of <hi>Vrigen</hi> is urg'd, who was made Catechist in the School of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and taught the <hi>Catechumens</hi> in the Rudiments of Christianty, as Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> relates it, and what is yet more, <hi>Theoctistus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cesarea,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> invited him to Preach before them.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Africa</hi> has always been noted for a Country abounding with strange and Monstrous Creatures; so are we continually pester'd with some surprizing and extraordinary fact in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Church, as if that differed from all the World besides. But to this Example of <hi>Origen,</hi> I first say, that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is as much obliged to reconcile it with the Presbyterian Principles, as I am with the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal: That <hi>Origen,</hi> though he instructed the <hi>Catechumens</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in the principles of Christianty (so do our School-Masters though not Ordained:) Haply once or so he preach'd at <hi>Cesarea</hi> before he had been Ordained, (so do our Fellows of Colleges at the University): Yet this is nothing to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he did not presume to Administer; and lastly though <hi>Theoctistus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> out of Curiosity desirous to hear the great <hi>Origen</hi> Discourse upon some profound point in Christianty invited him into the Pulpit, yet <hi>Demetrius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> condemn'd it, and it became a Scandal and occasion of offence among them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> speaking of Evangelists would prove them to have<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Def.</hi> p. 145.</note> been unfixt Officers from this observation out of <hi>Hilary,</hi> that Evangelists, that is Deacons (as <hi>Hilary</hi> thinks) did Preach <hi>sine Cathedra,</hi> which he expounds without a fixt Residence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is more absurd then any thing I have met with in my Adversary. <hi>Sine Cathedra, without a fixt Residence?</hi> He might as well have rendred it <hi>without fear or Wit.</hi> The meaning doubtless is, that whereas Presbyters had their Stalls, as well as the Bishop, and sate in his Presence,<note place="margin">Epiphan. Haer. 56. seu. 57.</note> and perhaps according to <hi>Hilary</hi> Preach'd out of them, the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons always stood, nor had their Stalls, so that when permitted they Preach'd <hi>sine Cathedra. Stantibus Diaconis,</hi> we often meet with in St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> himself took Notice — <hi>that the</hi>

In short, no one surely will dare to say, that Deacons were unfixt Officers in the Church, either in the Apostles or in <hi>Hilary'</hi>s Days.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Controversy is not about the manner of succeeding into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Method is either prescrib'd in Scripture or not. If it be, let the Presbyterians shew where, and we promise to observe it for the future: If not 'tis left to the Church, to Order this Circumstance as shall be thought fit. In the mean time we may not lay aside Bishops, because we have not a Divine Rule about their Succession. Many things are appointed in the Word of God, the particular Circumstances being left at large unto Humane Prudence. We are commanded to read the Scriptures, but not how much at a time, whether one or more Sections, whether one or more Chapters, nor in what Order: Shall we therefore abolish the Command it self, because these Circumstances are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly delivered to us in Scripture? God forbid! Supposing then that there have been different Customs taken up about the way of Succeeding into the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, this is no prejudice against Episcopacy its self.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is some matter of wonder to me how the Affairs of the Church could be prejudiced by the Oldest Presbyters, succeeding as of right to the first Chair or Presidency, if he received thereby no Power or Jurisdiction as our Adverr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries pretend.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is false, and nothing can be falser then this conceit of the Oldest Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter succeeding into the Episcopacy. <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Young Man and promoted by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that not for his Age, but his Merit: For surely none can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was the Oldest among the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Elders. What occasion then for the Apostles Admonition — <hi>let no Man despise thy Youth,</hi> if all the Presbyters were Younger than himself? And <hi>Jerom,</hi> who affirms that <hi>Paul</hi> Ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> his <hi>Maxim</hi> was, <hi>Presbyter aetatis Nomen est, Episcopus Officii:</hi> It had then been more Congruous according to our Adversaries Argument to have named all of'em Bishops, except the President, who should have been called Presbyter as being the Eldest among them. Afterwards <hi>Ignatius</hi> exhorts the <hi>Magnesians,</hi> not to despise <hi>Demas</hi> their Bishop for his Youth. Lastly, <hi>

               <p>BEfore I examine the Testimonies of this Father alledg'd by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Identity of Bishops and Presbyters, I will lay down my own Hypothesis, such, I am perswaded, as is agreeable to the Word of God.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30465:84"/>
And I am of Opinion also will go a great way to reconcile <hi>Jerom</hi> with himself.</p>
               <p>As for my own Opinion I make account with Bp. <hi>Pearson,</hi> that<note place="margin">Lectiones in Act. Apost.</note> the Christian Church strictly speaking, began upon the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when the Spirit descended upon the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and, as I may say, anointed them unto the Office of Preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and establishing the Christian Church throughout the World beginning at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> That they were for some small time the only Ecclesiastical Officers in the Church: That when the Church increased and believers were multiply'd, and by consequence the Apostles unable to manage the Whole Work by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they took in seaven Deacons to their Assistance, devolving on them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely one branch of their Power, <hi>viz.</hi> dispensing the Publick Alms among the Poor, as also admitting them to Preach the Word and Baptize, when Occasion offered, or necessity required, or their Leisure from their own proper business would allow: That not very long after (the Church still encreasing more and more, and believers multiplying not only at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> but at <hi>Samaria,</hi> and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Judea</hi>) the Apostles added another sort of Church Officers, that is Presbyters, <hi>Acts.</hi> 11. 30. <hi>ch.</hi> 15. That to these Presbyters were committed by the Apostles, the Principal Care and Trust of Ministring in the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and in their Absence of Ruling the Flock in Matters of less Moment, the Apostles still reserving to themselves the Supreme Power, in the Highest and Important affairs of the Church, which they discharged either by Messengers or by Letters, or else visiting them, and lastly that these Presbyters were indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently called, either Elders or Bishops, and governed the aforesaid Churches in a Parity among themselves. Of this Interval of time, I reckon <hi>Jerom</hi> might speak, when he contends for the Parity and Identity of Bishops and Presbyters. The Churches then hitherto were governed <hi>Communi Presbyterorum Consilio,</hi> by the Colleges of Presbyters, no other presiding over them in the Apostles Absence. In process of time, when the Apostles had determined among themselves to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse, in Order to the Preaching of the Gospel unto all the World, they resolv'd, that one being chosen from among the Presbyters should be set over the rest, unto whom all the care of the Church should belong, the seeds of Schism might be taken away, and that this should be established and observed, <hi>toto Orbe</hi> throughout the World. The period of time, when this Course was Taken by the Apostles, I have spoken of in the Preface. But <hi>Jerom</hi> in this Circumstance seems not at one with himself. For whereas in his Commentaries on the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> he supposes the Apostles to have taken up this Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution after the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schism, yet making <hi>James</hi> Bishop of<note place="margin">De Scr. Ec.</note> 
                  <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> He must of Necessity suppose it done before or at the Council of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at which time there was not any Church, or so much as one Christian at <hi>Corinth.</hi> By what name or Title the Persons thus chosen out of the Presbyters, and intrusted with the Supreme Government of Churches were called, is of little Moment to be enquired into. Nevertheless if <hi>Theodoret</hi> is to be Credited (as I know no reason to the contrary) they also were at first stiled Apostles, and it is with reason thought that <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus</hi> is therefore reckon'd or rather declared the <hi>Apostle</hi> of the <hi>Philippians</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2. 25.</note>. <hi>Blondel</hi> himself acknowledges there were a Secondary sort of Apostles among the Churches, Persons of the Highest Rank and most Eminent Gifts. I take these things in some measure proved sufficiently
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:30465:85"/>
before, and in what follows, and most reasonable in themselves to be supposed. Nevertherless if the Adversaries shall reject them, as 'tis most likely they will, I shall only say that I am not much concerned about them, that is, whether it be possible to make <hi>Jerom</hi> write consistently with himself. If not, his Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Controversy before us, is not worth a Rush, he having contradicted himself, and overthrown in one place, what he is made to have affirmed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Question then upon <hi>Jerom'</hi>s Authority is not about the precise time, when this Remedy against Schism was applyed by the Apostles; that's to say, whether before or immediately after the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Divisions (let <hi>Jerom</hi> look to that): But more generally, whether he believed or ever asserted, or could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently with himself assert, that this Provision against Schism was devised and made not till after the Apostles decease. The Presbyterians are oblig'd to hold the Affirmative, or else give up the Cause. My business then is to prove that <hi>Jerom</hi> did not believe nor ever asserted, nor could intend to assert, that the Decree about chusing one from among the Presbyters, and setting him above the rest, to preside and Govern the affairs of the Church was made after the Apostles days, by some Ecclesiastical Constitution; but that it was the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Appointment of the Apostles themselves: This I pretend to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the following Observations out of <hi>Jerom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. These Words of <hi>Jerom, toto Orbe decretum est,</hi> must denote it to have been an Apostolick Constitution. For an Ecclesiastical Decree obliging all Christendom to its Observation could never have been made for above 200 Years after the Apostles decease; and nothing less then an Oecumenical Synod had competent Power to prescribe this Remedy against Schism. But there never was any such Universal Council before that of <hi>Nice</hi> (too late to Father the Decree in the Judgment even of our Adversaries themselves.) Moreover this Apostles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons (as they are commonly called) which are a Collection of the most Ancient Decrees of the Church, take it for granted,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can. Apos.</hi> 1. 2. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> that the Government of the Church was lodg'd in the Hands of Bishops, and only regulate some Circumstances about their Ordinations and the Methods of their Government. If Bishops had been meerly by Ecclesiastical Constitution, we should certainly have found them established in these Apostolical Canons. It is not to be imagin'd the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of them would have omitted so important a Decree as this, whereon so many of their other Canons are built as on a Foundation. <hi>Jerom's toto Orbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretum est,</hi> must then imply that Episcopacy was an Apostolical Constitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The same may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from those Words, <hi>Remedium Schismatis &amp; Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copum nominabant,</hi> in <hi>Jerom'</hi>s Epistle to <hi>Evagrius.</hi> The Remedy then against Schism, must be as Ancient as the <hi>Presidents,</hi> who according to <hi>Jerom</hi> were called <hi>Bishops.</hi> Now they were stil'd Bishops before <hi>Ignatius</hi> was Martyred, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appears in his Epistles; therefore this Remedy against Schism was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised in the Apostolick Age, except any one will affirm that <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Followers, Disciples, Fellow-Labourers, and Fellow-Soldiers of the Apostles, who gave Testimony to the Gospel of Christ even unto Bloud, prepared this new Remedy against Schism, so soon as the Apostle St. <hi>John'</hi>s Eyes were Shut; and took upon them to set up a Government in the Church, which the Apostles were altogether strangers to, as our Adversaries suppose.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:30465:85"/>
               <p>3. <hi>Jerom.</hi> Witnesseth over and over again, that Bishops were established in the Churches, whilst the Apostles lived and flourished. Upon those Words — <hi>Quae est in to per impositionem manuum mearum,</hi> he<note place="margin">

Again whereas <hi>Jerom</hi> questions <hi>Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> to have been a Deacon of the Church of <hi>Coloss.</hi> ch. 4. 17. yet elsewhere, he puts the question to Himself — <hi>Quid est mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterium</hi>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Jerom</hi> has not shew'd, nor so much as directly asserted that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Alexandria</hi> made their Bishops: But he has omitted several Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances not only Material, but Advantagious to his main Design, if they had been true. <hi>Jerom,</hi> both in his Commentaries on <hi>Titus,</hi> and in his Epistle to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagrius,</hi> speaks constantly in the Passive Voice, how that one was chosen, and set over the rest; but by whom he says not. Why not by the Neighbouring Bishops? Why not by the Predecessor as well as by the Presbyters? <hi>Jerom</hi> has not expresly told us that the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> chosen out of the Presbyters, received another, and a new Consecration, nor that the Presbyters Ordained him, all which would have tended much to the Honour of himself, and his Fellow-Presbyters. True, he expresly says, the Presbyters <hi>nam'd</hi> him Bishop at his Instalment, bnt this does not necessarily imply either that they Chose, or Ordained him. He ought, and doubtless would have spoken out, if either, or both these things had been true. Whereas then Mr. <hi>O.</hi> adds, <hi>Jerom</hi> mentions no other way of Constituting them but by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,<note place="margin">Page 127.</note> it is certain he mentions no way at all. This is manifest' beyond all exception. <hi>Jerom</hi> has assur'd us of it, that the Apostles, not the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Made and Ordain'd Bishops in most parts of the Christian World; at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> at <hi>Coloss,</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and if <hi>Mark</hi> did not so at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> it were very strange. However <hi>Orbis Major est Urbe.</hi> It should indeed seem by the Allusions wherewith <hi>Jerom</hi> explains himself, that the Presbyters chose one of their own Number, and set him over the rest. So (says he) the Army chooses their General, the Deacons their Arch-Deacons. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting then this at present, I reply. 1. 'Tis no where so much as hinted in <hi>Jerom,</hi> that the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Presbyters Ordain'd their Patriarchs: But rather the contrary, that the neighbouring Bishops impos'd Hands on him. <hi>Quid facit excepta Ordinatione Episcopus quod non faciat Presbyter?</hi> In which words he must have an Eye unto the Custom of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church, from <hi>Mark</hi> to <hi>Heraclas,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> implying that Bishops, not Presbyters Ordain'd all that while.</p>
               <p>Well! But I have admitted that the Presbyters of <hi>Alexandria</hi> chose their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and then Mr. <hi>O.</hi> argues<note n="*" place="margin">Plea Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>That</hi> Jerom <hi>makes this an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Identity of Bishops and Presbyters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Whatever may be inferred from <hi>Jerom,</hi> I am very sure this is no good Argument for the Identity and Equality of Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For it is plain that Ordinary Deacons were not the same, nor equal to Arch-deacons, nor the Army to the Emperor, (as I have occasionally observ'd elsewhere) although the Deacons chose their Arch-deacons, and the Army set up the Emperor.</p>
               <p>For to what purpose is an Arch-Deacon chosen, or a General, if they be but still equal to the Army, and to the Deacons, if they have no power over them?
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:30465:87"/>

                     </gap>.</note> Soldiers afterwards demanded of him to chuse and receive a Partner in the Government; to which he reply'd — <q>It was in your choice (fellow Soldiers) whether you would chuse me Emperor or not; but since you have chosen me, what you require is in my power, not yours, and ye ought to rest contented as good Subjects.</q> But to return unto <hi>Jerom.</hi> I have shew'd before out of him, that the Apostles made Bishops; what then is become of this Argument for Parity in all the Churches of the World, except <hi>Alexandria?</hi> But if <hi>Jerom</hi> contradicts himself past all relief, I cannot help it. Yet again. Why may not one imagine that <hi>Jerom'</hi>s principal aim being to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Honour of Presbyters above Deacons, he noted that at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Bishop was chosen not out of the Deacons, but <hi>unum ex se, viz.</hi> out of the Presbyters? Ay, but 'twill be reply'd, that <hi>Jerom</hi> in this Epistle design'd to prove that Bishops and Presbyters, were at first the same, and that to other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their Identity, he subjoyns this Story of the Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> I reply, not so, if Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will allow me to reconcile <hi>Jerom</hi> with himself. I am not indeed able to account for <hi>Jerom,</hi> when he proves the Identity of Bishops and Presbyters, from sundry places of Scripture, the Epistles of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>John;</hi> and yet gives us a Catalogue of several Bishops in that time. But this I say, <hi>Jerom</hi> after he had advanc'd the Honour of Presbyters above Deacons, in that Epistle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> telling us there was a time when Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were the same. He proceeds to argue from the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that there, even to <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> for 200 Years, the Bishops were chosen out of the Presbyters, not out of the Deacons, which Observation was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to prove the Presbyterian Identity, nor the Parity, but the Honour given to the Presbyters above Deacons, because the Patriarch was for a long while chosen out of their Number only. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let what will become of <hi>Jerom</hi> and his Arguments, this is sure, and confessed on all Hands, there were always Bishops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> from the beginning of their Conversion by <hi>Mark.</hi> It no manner of way belongs to the present Controversy how, or by whom chosen and set up. If the Scripture shall be thought not to have determin'd this point, I mean what way, and bywhom the Bishops shall be Constituted, it is then in the Church to determine, but not utterly to lay them aside.</p>

                  <hi>We read not of any other Consecration</hi> of the Bishops of <hi>Alexandria, than the Presbyters Election, and their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him in an higher Degree, and naming him Bishop.</hi> No, has Mr. <hi>O.</hi> forgot, or did he not know till aster he had thus shot his Bolt, that according to <hi>Eutychius,</hi> cited this very 128th <hi>p.</hi> that by the Institution of <hi>Mark, The Presbyters when the Patriarchship was vacant, chose one of their Number, on whose Head they laid their Hands, and blessed him, and created him Patriarch.</hi> And if this be true, <hi>Jerom</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a very material thing that would have made for the Honour of Presbyters and their Identity with Bishops; and Mr. <hi>O.</hi> forgot another, that of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters imposing Hands on their new Patriarch, which I take to be somewhat more than Electing, Placing and Naming him Bishop. <q>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> proves<note n="*" place="margin">Plea Ibid.</note> there was anciently no other Consecration but Electing, Placing and Naming him Bishop, from the Testimony of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydor Virgil,</hi> who in his Book <hi>de Invent. rerum, l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has a Knack above all other Men to misrepresent Authors: And though I resolved not to concern my self with late Writers: Yet being <hi>Polydor</hi> was in his time a Learned Man, and of no small Reputation in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> I will with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> pay some deference to his Testimony and Character. Let us then hear, what <hi>Polydor</hi> has delivered in the place cited. He tells, <q>That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> created twelve Pontiffs, whom he called Apostles, also Seventy Disciples, whom he made (<hi>Sacerdotes</hi>) Priests; that from these latter the Order of Presbyters arose, that the Apostles and Disciples were not admitted into their Office by any other Rites save only the Election or Institution of Christ.</q> Which <hi>Polydor</hi> proves immediately after from the practice of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in taking <hi>Matthias</hi> into their Number, and instituting the Seven Deacons. Let us run through <hi>Polydor'</hi>s Argument backward, and see what it says. The Apostles imposed Hands on the Seven Deacons, therefore on <hi>Matthias,</hi> and by consequence according to <hi>Virgil,</hi> so did Christ lay Hands on the Apostles, and Seventy Disciples. So that this Authority out of <hi>Polydor</hi> recoils upon himself. Indeed Mr. <hi>O.</hi> owns as much: But then thereby he destroys his own propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is, <hi>We know no other Ceremony but Election,</hi> &amp;c. But is not Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Hands a Ceremony, and more than Electing, placing and nominating him Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop? I am perswaded it is a Ceremony. Thus Mr. <hi>O.</hi> confutes himself, when he pretends to confirm his Opinion.</p>
               <p>I cannot pass by one thing, which <hi>Polydor</hi> very falsly tacks to his Discourse here concerning the Original of Imposition of Hands, which he derives from our Lord and his Apostles, but adds, <hi>at<expan>

               <p>Hence we must learn, that before <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the Bishops were not consecrated by Imposition of Hands, but barely elected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that after <hi>

                  <hi>Ans. Jerom</hi> teaches us no such thing. He is here only falling upon a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as I said before, to advance the Honour of Presbyters above Deacons, <hi>sc.</hi> that at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Bishops were always chosen (<hi>ex se</hi>) <hi>out of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, says</hi> Eutychius, not out of the Deacons (though the Custom was afterwards changed about the time of <hi>Heraclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> or not until <hi>Alexander</hi> as <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. And here is a full proof that Bishops were from the beginning, and were Created also by Imposition of Hands, which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> just before denyed upon the Authority of <hi>Jerom,</hi> and was now to have proved, if he had stuck close to his Argument. But it must be confess'd, <hi>Eutychius</hi> does assert the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian</hi> Presbyters chose, and created their own Bishops by Imposition of Hands and Benediction, Wherefore 2. not to insift any more on the incompetency of <hi>Eutychius</hi> his Authority, a late obscure and false Historian, I ask how Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will be able to reconcile <hi>Jerom</hi> with <hi>Eutychius,</hi> the former affirming (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> understands him) that the Presbyters chose, and set up their Bishops unto <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> (then it seems this Custom ceas'd) the latter unto <hi>Alexander:</hi> That is to say, <hi>Eutychius</hi> will have this Custom to have continued 90 Years longer then <hi>Jerom</hi> assigned it. <hi>Eutychius</hi> says, the Presbyters all that while Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained their Patriarchs by imposition of Hands; <hi>Jerom</hi> no such matter, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Contrary: They only (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will have it) chose placed and named him Bishop. We must then dismiss them both as the Evangelist did the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses against our Lord, their Witness does not agree together. I only add, that the 6th Canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council seems to overturn at least <hi>Eutychius</hi> his Testimony: <hi>Let the Ancient Customs continue,</hi> which I understand of all things established by this Synod, and among the rest that of the Neighbouring Bishops in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Ordaining the Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> For if this Synod (as <hi>Eutychius</hi> believed) at the motion of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Patriarch had altered the Old Custom, with what Face could they have laid down this Rule, <hi>Let the Ancient Customs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue?</hi> Or was it Wisdom to exasperate the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> with a New decree, when they were already engaged in Schisms and Contentions about the <hi>Melitian</hi> Ordinations? To shut up this Chapter, whatever <hi>Jerom</hi> shall be made to say concerning the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Presbyters, chusing placing and nominating their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, he no where affirms they Ordained him by imposition of Hands and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: He acquaints us that the Apostles Ordained Bishops in their Time, not the College of Presbyters. If afterwards the Presbyters of <hi>Alexandria</hi> chose, and created their Bishop by Imposition of Hands, it was at best but an Ecclesiastical Indulgence, for which there is no Rule or Precedent to be found in Scripture or in the Apostles Days. But I am well satisfy'd, that in truth there could be no such Liberty allowed them. <hi>Ne<expan>

But in the next instance Mr. <hi>O.</hi> seems to have overlook'd both these necessary Precautions, and has at Adventures produc'd a Scrap of a Testimony in favour of himself, as he thinks, but which in the end will prove fatal to his Cause, and will confirm the World in the Belief, that he is either very rash and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in his own Quotations, or that he will stick at nothing, so he may seem to support his own Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Fathers (<hi>says He</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 159.</note>) in the second Council of <hi>Carthage, Anno</hi> 428<note n="†" place="margin">An. 397.</note> did observe, <q>That until that time some Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses never had any Bishops at all, and thereupon Ordained, they should have none for the future. They would never have made such a Canon, had they concluded the Government by Bishops to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I agree with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> in the Deduction he has made, provided the Premises were true. To make these good, therefore he quotes that Canon aforesaid thus — <hi>placet ut Dioceses, quae <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Episcopos acceperunt, non habeant.</hi> Whoever first formed this Argument against Episcopacy, has grosly abused his Reader and the the Council too. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> perhaps borrowed it of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> or some such kind of Author, whose Interest and Partiality will not suffer them to let the Reader see the whole Period, least at the same time he should discern the Truth, and themselves be found Guilty of Falsification, which I doubt not to make out in a few Words.</p>
               <p>To which end I will take the Liberty to lay the Canon before the Reader in its own Language. For though the <hi>African</hi> Fathers used the Latin Tongue, yet all the Latin Copies among us at this Day were derived from the Greek Version, as <hi>Justellus</hi> tells us, which is therefore the most Authentick, and ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of greatest Authority. The said Canon therefore runs thus — <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In <hi>English</hi> thus — <q>It was determined that the People in the Diocesses (<hi>not the Diocesses</hi>) having formerly belong'd to Bishops, but never having had a proper Bishop of their own, should not have (<hi>now for the Future</hi>) their own proper Rectors, that's to say Bishops, except by the Consent of that Bishop under whose Jurisdiction (<hi>at present</hi>) they are.</q> From whence it appears 1. That the People here spoken of were aforetime Subject to Bishops, which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has miserably perverted by saying, that — till that time <hi>the Diocesses</hi> never had any Bishops at all, contrary to the apparent sense of that Canon, which affirms
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:30465:89"/>
it, and describes those People thus — <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and again <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the People here spoken of were even in the possession, and under the Jurisdiction of Bishops: <hi>Ex. gra.</hi> To make the matter plainer to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> The People of <hi>Lancashire</hi> cannot be said never to have had any Bishops at all, it being well known that the Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> is their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan. 2. The People mentioned in the Canon had not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a proper Bishop peculiar to themselves. Thus it is true, that the County of <hi>Lancaster</hi> never had to this Day a proper Bishop of their own. 3. The <hi>African</hi> Fathers did not Peremptorily resolve that those People should have no Bishop for the future, though Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has very falsly affirmed it. But two things they define, either first that they should continue in subjection to their former Bishop, that is to keep to my Example, that the County of <hi>Lancaster</hi> should continue as a Member of the Diocess of <hi>Chester:</hi> Or else secondly, that they should be erected into a Distinct Bishoprick, and have their own proper Bishop, provided neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less that it be with the Consent of their former Bishop, or thus in the Example, that the County of <hi>Lancaster</hi> should be made a Bishoprick by its self, and have a proper Bishop of its own, provided my Lord of <hi>Chester</hi> would consent thereunto. There is another Canon, in the <hi>African</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Can. 98. An. 407.</note> 
                  <hi>Code</hi> which is more full to my purpose — <q>It pleased the Synod that the People, who never had proper Bishops of their own, should not have them, Except it be so decreed in a full Provincial Synod, and (<hi>particularly</hi>) by the Primate, and with the Consent of that Bishop, unto whose Government that Church (<hi>or the aforesaid People</hi>) formerly belonged.</q> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> he had dealt honestly and faithfully with the <hi>African</hi> Fathers and with us, should have cited the whole Period at length, and not abused them, and endeavoured to cozen the present Age with such Counterfeit Stuff. I have this only farther to remark upon these Canons of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Councils (and so shall conclude), that the Occasion of making the former (and of the latter too as is probable) was the Ambitious and Haughty, and Aspiring, Stubborn and Foolish (for all these Epithets are there bestowed on them) Disposition of some Presbyters, who raising their Crests against their own Bishops, and Wheedling the People by some indirect means, would needs in a Disorderly manner make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves their Rectors <hi>i. e.</hi> Bishops.

Thus the Canon runs — <hi>Episcopo eum (</hi>sc. <hi>Presbyterum) benedicente Omnes,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:30465:90"/>2. This Canon, though <hi>Caranza</hi> and other Authors mention it, is not to be found in the <hi>African Code</hi> set forth by <hi>Justellus,</hi> which makes me suspect, that the Fathers, who in the Council of <hi>Trull,</hi> took the <hi>African</hi> into the <hi>Code</hi> of the Universal Church, look'd upon it either as Spurious, or rejected it as to the matter therein decreed. But I will not insist on this.</p>

The Occasion of it was this. A certain Bishop being Blind, laid on his Hands at the Ordination of some Presbyters and Deacons with the rest of his Presbyters; <hi>&amp; Presbyter quidam illis contra Ecclesiasticum Ordinem benedictionem dedisse fertur.</hi> For which ('tis added that) the Presbyter deserved to be condemned, but that he was in the mean time dead. From whence I think 'tis plain, 1. That Ordination was not effectually given by Imposition of Hands, but by Benediction the Charge or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission (wherein properly consifted the Ordination) which was given to the Ordained. 2. All the Irregularity here committed was, that the Presbyter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd <hi>Benedicere,</hi> and there with it may be to give the Commission, that is to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, which if Imposition of Hands was Ordination, had been no Irregularity at least no Essential defect, as it is declared to be. 3. For if Imposition of Hands be the Ordination, then there was no Irregularity in these Ordinations, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop having laid his Hands on the Ordained, as 'tis testifyed in the Canon, as well as that Presbyter, who blest him. 4.

To the Minor I answer by denying Imposition of Hands to be an Ordaining Act, 'tis only an outward and Solemn Concomitant of it, as is before Evinc'd though Warranted by Holy Scripture. By the Imposition of the Bishops and Presbyters Hands is signifyed to the Congregation present, that the Bishop Ordains the Person with the advice Consent and Council of his Presbyters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:30465:90"/>But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> adds, <q>I should be glad to see one Instance given in the Apostles days, of Persons laying on of Hands in Ordination, that had no Ordaining Power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If I should affirm that those mentioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. imposed Hands, but had no Ordaining Power, I am very sure he can't disprove me: And if I should demand one Instance in the Apostles times of meer Presbyters laying on of hands, or Ordaining without a Bishop; I am sure Mr. <hi>O.</hi> cannot produce it. But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> pleads<note n="*" place="margin">P. 90.</note> How then comes the Bishops to urge the Scripture? (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22.) <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no Man, in favour of</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy's <hi>Ordaining Power, and thence to infer that he was Bishop of</hi> Ephesus, <hi>since he might lay on Hands, and yet have no Ordaining Power, nor be Bishop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This difficulty is easily resolved. If there were no other Argument for <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy'</hi>s Episcopal Power in the Church of <hi>Ephesus;</hi> but that Text only, it might thence be fairly inferred, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and had the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Ordaining, because no other are joyn'd in Commission with him; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, though this prov'd it not, it may be evinc'd from other pregnant Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in those Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which I need not repeat.</p>
               <p>Nor do we acknowledge Presbyters may perform all the outward Acts of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination: That of Benediction belongs not to them at all.</p>
               <p>But (says he) <hi>What does the Presbyters imposing of Hands signifie, if not an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Power?</hi> I have told him already, it denotes their Approbation, and that the Bishop <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> with their Advice and Consent: <hi>No,</hi> (he replys<note n="*" place="margin">P. 91.</note>) <hi>they could signifie their Approbation some other way without imposition of Hands, as by saying</hi> Amen <hi>to the Ordination Prayers.</hi> But this is to be wiser than God and his Apostles, who have (as I often have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, though I need not grant it) recommended this way, which adds an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Solemnity unto the Action; at least the Church has thought fit to admit the Presbyters to lay on Hands, and thereby to signify their Approbation (of such as are taken into their own proper Ministry) in a particular way and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the Peoples testifying their Assent. And this is the reason why at the Ordination of a Deacon, Presbyters were not to impose Hands, <hi>sc. Quia non ad Sacerdotium sed ad Ministerium Consecratur,</hi>

Otherwise, probably they would have had Power of Imposition of Hands at the Ordination of Deacons also. Briefly, because in the Prosecution of this Argument Mr. <hi>O.</hi> appeals to the Scripture so oft for proof of certain things that fell in his way whilst he was managing this Point; I do once more here desire, what I have often call'd for, one single probable proof, or Example from Scripture of bare ordinary Presbyters Ordaining, or laying on of Hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Superior presiding in the Action,</p>

Let this matter be bang'd in the Schools so long as Criticks shall please, yet seeing there is no colour for asserting Presbyters to be Ordainers without the Bishop, whatever they be with him, I make no difficulty to affirm that their Ordinations without the Bishop, are without Precedent, either in Scripture or Antiquity, and by consequence, in themselves Null and Invalid.

                  <hi>dignissimam providere eum Presbyterii honore provexit.</hi> He adds, <q>That <hi>Theophilus</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce<note place="margin">Page 131.</note> the Ordination null that we read of, nor any other in that time. Had it been either irregular, or unusual, doubtless it had been Censur'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It must not be deny'd but that this Instance of Presbyters Ordaining ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the fairest of all others that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has muster'd up in his <hi>Plea.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, what I have to reply, is as follows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is but a single Instance of a (for ought I know) Humoursome Abbot, who took upon him to do this contrary to the known and establish'd Order of the Catholick Church, and particularly, of the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> whereof he is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have been a part: The Desert of <hi>Scetis,</hi> where he usually resided, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to the Lake <hi>Maria,</hi> or <hi>Maeris,</hi> which borders on <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas 'tis urged, that <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria, did not pronounce this Ordination void and null that we read of,</hi> there is no great matter in this. For it may with as great reason be argued, that <hi>Theophilus</hi> would have Censured it, if it had come to his knowledge, there being no probability that <hi>Theophilus</hi> would have past by such a Disorder and Affront done to the Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, seeing <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> his Predecessors, would not bear with the <hi>Melitians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis wonderful that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> should Insinuate that it was neither irregular, nor unusual, which in former Cases he has granted over and over again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Valesius</hi> tells me,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Annot. in Soc.</hi> P. 7. &amp; 112.</note> that <hi>Paphnutius</hi> was engaged in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litian</hi> Schism, as <hi>Ephiphanius</hi> testisies, <hi>de Haeresi Melitianorum.</hi> He also observes, that the Schism was then improv'd unto Heresie. 'Tis no wonder then that an Heretical Schismatick should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to break through the Rules and Orders of that Church, from which he divided, and usurp a Power that nothing belonged to him. And hence also may be drawn the reason why <hi>Theophilus</hi> took no notice of what <hi>Paphnutius</hi> did, he being a Schismatick, (if not an Heretick) and out of the Communion of the Church; and what had the Patriarch to do to judge them that were without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? As St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in somewhat a like Case. But</p>
               <p n="5">5. I will not content my self with these Answers, though I<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 12.</note> reckon them sufficient: But add, 'tis no where affirmed by <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus</hi> that <hi>Paphnutius</hi> Ordained <hi>Daniel</hi> a Deacon, or Presbyter; but only <hi>Cum Daniel multis junior esset aetate ad Diaconii</hi> praelatus <hi>est Officium,</hi> and then <hi>Festinavit coae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quare,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:30465:92"/>
made baste to equal</hi> Daniel <hi>with himself in the Honour of the Priest-hood.</hi> And <hi>Lastly,</hi> desiring to provide a most worthy Successor to himself whilst he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, <hi>Provexit promoted</hi> him to the Honour of the Presbytership. The Question is whether these Words signifie that <hi>Paphnutius</hi> Ordained <hi>Daniel.</hi> That he did so, can no ways be concluded from this Testimony of <hi>Cassianus.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It has been ordinary to attribute that unto a Person, which indeed he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded, or directed, devised, or procured to be done. Thus Parents are commonly said to <hi>make</hi> their Sons Ministers, but Ordain them not themselves. Thus Patrons among us <hi>make</hi> and <hi>prefer</hi> Vicars and Rectors of Churches (and the King Bishops) though Bishops Ordain and Institute them. Thus <hi>Joshua</hi> made him sharp Knives, and Circumcised the Children of <hi>Israel. Joshua</hi> 5. 3. Now I hope Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will not affirm that <hi>Joshua</hi> himself <hi>made</hi> the sharp Knives, or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised all these <hi>Israelites</hi> with his own hands. But to come yet nearer to our purpose, I read in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>

               <p>It may not be amiss to consider what <hi>Blondel</hi> has from this Testimony of <hi>Cassia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> advanced<note n="*" place="margin">Apol. 358.</note> for the establishment of Presbyterian Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He places this fact in the Year 390. when the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Church enjoyed a profound Peace, and <hi>Theophilus</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Government of this Church was improved in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Secular Dominion. <q>If in these Circumstances (<hi>He argues</hi>) a Presbyter might Ordain Presbyters, how much more before the ancient simplicity of the Gospel was shackled with Novel Constitutions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is is some prejudice against this Story of <hi>Cassianus,</hi> that neither <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Sozomen, Theodoret,</hi> nor any of those Ecclesiastical Historians, though they mention <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> should have one Syllable of this Action, nor so much as mention <hi>Daniel.</hi> Besides the <hi>Egytian</hi> Churches were not in so perfect Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as Mr. <hi>Blondel</hi> imagines, and represents them. The <hi>Melitian</hi> Schism still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained among them, and this <hi>Paphnutius</hi> was one of them, as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:30465:92"/>
so that it is not be wondered at, that <hi>Paphnutius</hi> presumed to Ordain, and <hi>Theophilus</hi> overlook'd, and neglected it. For what had he to do with them that were already out of the Church and Excommunicated, as the <hi>Melitians</hi> must needs be supposed. This premised I frame an Argument against <hi>Blondel,</hi> and (as I conceit) every whit as good as his. 'Tis this. <q>If in the most Turbulent State of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Church, when <hi>Alexander</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Ordinations of <hi>Melitius</hi> and <hi>Colluthus</hi> were declared invalid, it is Morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the Ordination of <hi>Daniel</hi> by <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> should be approved or connived at, when <hi>Theophilus</hi> being Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Episcopacy was raised to a higher degree of Grandeur, and the Peace of the Church better established.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter, let it be remembred, what I have already noted out of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> how that Bishops were wont to<note place="margin">

               </head>
               <p>THE case was this. There were was in the Diocess of <hi>Rusticus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Narbona</hi> (as may be conjectured from Pope <hi>Leo'</hi>s Epistle) some Persons, who toook upon 'em to Ordain, and who are called by that Pope <hi>Pseudo Episcopi. Rusticus</hi> complains thereof in a Letter to <hi>Leo,</hi> which is not extant that I know of. <hi>Leo'</hi>s Answer is — <q>There is no reason they should be accounted Bishops, who were neither chosen by the Clergy, nor desired by the People, nor Consecrated by the Provincial Bishops at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Metropolitan. Whence, when the Question often arises concerning the Honour (<hi>he means Episcopacy, and the Power of Ordaining</hi>) who can doubt that, what does not appear to have been <hi>truly</hi> Conferred, is in no wise to be given by those <hi>Pseudo Episcopi.</hi> But if any Clergy-Man in those Churches, which belong unto their own proper Bishop, have been Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those <hi>Pseudo Episcopi,</hi> and the Ordination was performed with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and appointment of the Presidents (<hi>or proper Bishops</hi>) it may be ratify'd; provided they remain in those Churches.</q> This Pope <hi>Leo</hi> flourished about the Year 442.</p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>O.</hi> who alledges, this Decree of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> against<note place="margin">P. 131.</note> us, is upon the Proof of Presbyters Ordaining, which I do not see is in the least favoured by these Words, except he will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> these <hi>Pseudo Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi</hi> were Presbyters only. When Mr. <hi>O.</hi> shall have proved this, I shall think
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:30465:93"/>
my self oblig'd to return an Answer to it, and not before. In the mean while I observe Mr. <hi>O.</hi> leaving his Argument adduces this Passage to throw dirt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Establish'd Bishops, and prove 'em to be uncanonically Ordained, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Confirming his own dear Presbyterian Ordination: But let us see what He says.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Two things are remarkable in the decision of <hi>Leo the Great.</hi> 1. That our <hi>English</hi> Bishops wanting two of the requisites mentioned in the Popes Decree, <hi>sc. The Election of the Clergy, and the demand of the People,</hi> their Ordinations therefore have a Canonical Nullity in them, and our <hi>English</hi> Bishops would have been reckoned <hi>Pseudo Episcopi</hi> in <hi>Leo'</hi>s time.</q> Upon which remark I make the following Reflexions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are beholden to Mr. <hi>O.</hi> for making his simple Friends believe that we are departed from the decrees of the Popes. From henceforth then let them not reproach our Bishops for Popish.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is in the right. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> perhaps would have called our Bishops <hi>Pseudo Episcopi:</hi> I am sure at this Day the Popes do not fail to condemn 'em as such. 3. The uncanonical Ordination of Bishops among us, will not excuse that of the Presbyterians, much less justify their Anti-Scriptural Ordinations. No one can defend himself by Recrimination: But a greater fault can never be excused by a lesser. 4. We are so far from tying up our selves to the strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of <hi>Papal</hi> or Provincial Canons, that we think not our selves abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely oblig'd to the Observation of the Decrees of the Oecumenical Synods, but take Libery to vary from them, when ever necessity or great convenience invites us to it: Otherwise we endeavour to conform our selves to them, as much as is possible. 5. I have more than once in the Preface to <hi>I. N.</hi> and in the former part of this Treatise (I hope) sufficiently evinc'd, that <hi>our Bishops want neither the Election of the Clergy, nor the Consent of the People,</hi> and therefore their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on that score have no Canonical Nullity in them. But.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> remarks from the foresaid Decree of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> 
                  <q>That the consent of the true Bishops <hi>ex post facto</hi> made the Ordination of meer Presbyters lawful, which could not be unless Presbyters had an intrinsick Power of Ordination.</q> Hereunto I return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> ought first to prove that these <hi>Pseudo Episcopi</hi> were meer Presbyters. I am otherwise perswaded and think I can evince it out of <hi>Leo'</hi>s Decree. 2. The consent of the true Bishops was not required <hi>ex post facto</hi> (that's the disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and false Gloss of an Adversary) but antecedent to the Ordination, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from these Words, <hi>&amp; (si) Ordinatio Clericorum consensu &amp; judicio Praesidenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um facta est, if the Ordination of the Ministers was made with the Consent and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bishops.</hi> Let any Man of understanding judge whether this Consent and appointment of the Provincial Bishops, was to be Antecedent to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or to follow them. 3. Whereas Mr. <hi>O.</hi> renders <hi>Pseudo Episcopi false Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> as it were in opposition to <hi>true</hi> Bishops (so he renders <hi>proprios Episcopos</hi>) 'tis I think a mistake. The proper Bishops being the Bishops of the Diocesses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Provinces, and by consequence the <hi>Pseudo Episcopi,</hi> such as had no Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess there, and therefore could not Ordain regularly without the consent and appointment of the proper Bishops of the Diocesses: Of which I have spoken before. Upon the Whole matter, how Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will be able to infer hence, that Ordination by meer Presbyters can be lawful, or that they have an intrinsick
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:30465:93"/>
Power to Ordain, I am yet to learn. If these <hi>Pseudo Episcopi</hi> were real Bishops, as they must have been, if their Ordinations were valid when the proper Bishops consent was first obtained, what is this to the Advantage of Presbyterian Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This is plain, that though the Pope called 'em <hi>Pseudo Episcopi,</hi> yet they reckon themselves real Bishops, and not meer Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters: Which is a strong presumption that in those times, meer Presbyters were not allowed to Ordain. For to what purpose else should they assume the Title and Character of Bishops? Our Presbyterians do not think there is any need for them to usurp the Title of Bishops, and that because they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to have Power of Ordination, as Presbyters. All the Difficulty is why <hi>Leo</hi> calls 'em <hi>Pseudo Episcopi,</hi> if they were real Bishops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The reason hereof I conceivé is, because they had been Ordained Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, but were not possessed of any Diocesses in those Provinces, and yet took upon them to Act there, which they ought not to have done, it being contrary to the peace and establish'd Order of the Church, This appears from the first Words of the Decree. <q>There is no reason they should be accounted Bishops (<hi>that is have Liberty to Act as Bishops in those Diocesses and Provinces</hi>) who were neither chosen by the Clergy, nor desired by the People, nor Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the Provincial Bishops at the appointment of the Metropolitan.</q> From these Words 'tis plain that he speaks not of meer Presbyters: For it was never required by any Ecclesiastical Canon, that meer Presbyters were to be Ordained <hi>by the Provincial Bishops with the Consent of the Metropolitan.</hi> This Ecclesiastical Rule and Constitution concerned Bishops only. So that I reckon the Pope called them <hi>Pseudo Episcopi,</hi> not because they were not Ordained Bishops, but because they acted irregularly in other Bishops Diocesses.</p>

                     <hi>Zeilan,</hi> as 'tis now called, there was a Church of Christians governed by a Presbyter and his Deacon, without any Superiour Bishop to whom he or his Flock was Subject. This Island is above 2000 Miles in Compass, a Province big enough for a Bishop, yet had none in <hi>Justin</hi> the Emperor's time, which was about the Year 520. but was under the Jurisdiction of a Presbyter Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in <hi>Persia,</hi> who in all likelyhood Ordained his Successor, and would not be at the trouble of sending for one to very remote Countries:</q> From hence Mr. <hi>O.</hi> roundly concludes — <hi>that Bishops were not thought Essential to Churches, no not in the 6th Age, and that meer Presbyters have power of Jurisdiction, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30465:94"/>
of Ordination.</hi> I'll not now contest the Truth of the story; Let us rather suppose the matter of Fact to be as it is reported by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> — But I have these following things to reply to it, and to the conclusion drawn from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How does Mr. <hi>O.</hi> know that this Presbyter and his Deacon, and the flock of Christians belonging to 'em were without a Superior Bishop, to whom they were Subject? They might be subject to some Bishop in <hi>Persia,</hi> for any thing he can tell or the first Relator says. 'Tis true, this Presbyter <hi>regebat,</hi> he did rule the flock, but it might be under some Bishop; the likelihood hereof is the greater, because he was Ordained in <hi>Persia,</hi> and from thence sent to propagate the Gospel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas Mr. <hi>O.</hi> thinking to magnify the Power of Presbyters, and to shew what vast Churches have been rul'd by them without Bishops, acquaints us that this Island is (or was) 2000 Miles in Compass, and that it was <hi>big enough for a Bishop,</hi> it might not be unseasonable to ask him first, whether he is not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the extent of the Island. <hi>Heylin</hi> makes it but 700 or 800 at most. Well but I'll not stand with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> for 1200 or 1300 Miles; Almost two thirds shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> break Squares between him and me, especially since he has so good a Geographer on his side as <hi>N. Lloyd;</hi> granting then this. 2. Neither his Country-Man <hi>Lloyd,</hi> nor <hi>Heylin</hi> make any mention of Christians in this Island. The story then may be but a Fable at last. 3. I ask whether there were any more than one single Congregation of Christians in this Island, or more than one Presbyter and his Deacon. If not he has the reason why there was no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in the Island; but that the Presbyter and his Flock were subject unto some <hi>Persian</hi> Bishop. If he says there were Christians up and down in the Island (as his telling us of the large compass of it seems to intimate) and many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and yet this Presbyter ruled 'em all, why then we have a real, though not nominal Bishop, I mean in respect of Jurisdiction. 4. Whereas Mr. <hi>O.</hi> makes this Reflection, that this Island in Compass 2000 Miles, was a Province big enough for a Bishop, he'll give me leave (I hope) to retort, that it seems it was not too big for one Presbyter and his Deacon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let it be observed, that Mr. <hi>O.</hi> knows not but this Presbyter had a Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor in that Island: For there is a Tradition that <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gospel in <hi>Persia, India</hi> and <hi>Taprobane.</hi> I demand then upon that supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who Ordained his Predecessor? A Bishop in <hi>Persia</hi> in likelihood; for so much is reasonably gathered from this Presbyter's being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Ordained there; and Bishops were before that time in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zos.</hi> l. 2. c. 9. 14.</note> If so, there is more Probability that this Presbyters Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor also was Ordained in <hi>Persia,</hi> than that the Presbyter himself Ordained him. But these things are all in the dark, and we know not certainly that this Presbyter had either a Predecessor or a Successor, and so Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s whole Argument is lost: He has built upon no Foundation: It tumbles down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> its own accord. I add, 'tis likely this Church in <hi>Taprobane</hi> increased not much, nor continued long, there being no Monument of a Christian Church there, but the Monk <hi>Cosma'</hi>s Tale of this single Presbyter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Since we must contend with likelihoods, I ask whether it be not much more likely, that this Presbyter being Ordained in <hi>Persia,</hi> did take care rather, that his Successor (if he had any) should be there Ordained likewise, than that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should presume to Ordain Him. There is not any the least ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30465:94"/>
that the Presbyter himself Ordained Him; but there is some to think that his Successor was Ordained in <hi>Persia, viz.</hi> because he himself was.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Admitting that the Church of Christ in this Island of <hi>Taprobane</hi> continued there for some Ages, if it increased not much (which is most likely because we hear nothing more of it) it might depend upon and remain subject unto some <hi>Persian</hi> Bishop, and be under his Guidance and direction, as our Western Islands are under the Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> If it flourish'd and Christians multiply'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably there, who can tell but they had Bishops of their own afterwards?</p>
               <p>The summ of the matter is — <hi>A certain Monk called</hi> Cosmas (a Man of no Note and Reputation that I know of) <hi>tells a lame story of a Presbyter</hi> (without a Name, which renders the Tale Suspicious) <hi>who in the Year</hi> 520, (when all the World besides was confessedly Episcopal) <hi>was Ordained in Persia</hi> (where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church was Episcopal) <hi>and ruled a Church in Zeilan</hi> (no one knows how Numerous, or how long he ruled it, nor how long it continued a Church) <hi>without a Superiour Bishop</hi> (says Mr. <hi>O.</hi> which is more than is testify'd by the Relators) <hi>and in all likelihood Ordained his own Successor, and would not be at the Trouble of sending for one to very Remote Countries</hi> (all which is spoken at Random, it being in the story not so much as intimated that he had any Successor, or that he Ordained him, or that he was unwilling to get a Successor from a remote Country). And from hence without any Colour of pretence very rashly, and very weakly Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has gather'd <hi>that even in the 6th Century, Bishops were thought Essential, and that meer Presbyters have Power to Ordain.</hi> If this must pass for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Argument against Episcopal Government, or in the least favours the Presbyterian, I do renounce all pretence to common Sense.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE have now been a long Journey in search after some Instance of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Ordaining, or some Law and Custom that warrants it: We have been in <hi>Africa,</hi> and among the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Desert of <hi>Scetis,</hi> at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probane,</hi> which lies to <hi>East-India,</hi> among the Northern <hi>Scythians,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> and among the <hi>Picts,</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> in the most remote parts of <hi>Britain:</hi> We have examined the most famous Councils and their Definitions, of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Ancyra, Antioch,</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Synods, and all to as little purpose as they who seek a Needle in a Bottle of Hay. We are now at length going to visit <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina Apostolorum, Rome</hi> its self the Centre of Christendom, and thence to learn what may be found in the practice of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Successors for Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Power to Ordain: And surely we will not decline the determination of this Question, which the Infallible Church has made by her Example. To this purpose therefore we are put in Mind of the Ordination of <hi>Pelagius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which happened about the Year 555 and is remembred by
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30465:95"/>
                  <hi>Anastasius,</hi> who wrote the lives of the Popes. <hi>Anastasius</hi> then<note place="margin">De Vit. Pont. P. 140.</note> relates, as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> tells me, how that — <q>
                     <hi>Pelagius</hi> the first, Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was Ordained by <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Perusia, Bonus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Andreas</hi> Presbyter <hi>de Hostia:</hi> Whereas by the Canons three Bishops are absolutely necessary for the Ordination of a Bishop.</q> Before I make a direct Answer to this and to the Argument, which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> builds upon the Fact it is requisite, that I tell the story a little more largely. For some Men have got a Scurvy Trick to leave out whatever is to their Disadvantage or In validates the Force of their Argument, it being not the Truth but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Cause, which they labour to support. The story then is thus. <q>
                     <hi>Vigilius,</hi> the Immediate Predecessor of <hi>Pelagius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plat.

He therefore in the place of the third admitted <hi>Andreas</hi> the Presbyter of <hi>Hostia,</hi> and what will not such a Man as <hi>Pelagius</hi> do to establish himself in so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Post as the Bishoprick of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </q> But if such as these shall pass for good Precedents, any Irregularity in the World may at this Rate be Justifyed.</p>
               <p>Thus much being premised, let us see what use Mr. <hi>O.</hi> makes of this Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> He argues thus — <hi>Either</hi> Pelagius <hi>was no Canonical Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or else a Presbyter has Intrinsick Power of Ordination,</hi> &amp;c. that is, either <hi>Pelagius</hi> was no Canonical Bishop, and then the Succession was interrupted in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Consequently the <hi>English</hi> Bishops have no Canonical Succession, Or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I reply that though <hi>Pelagius</hi> was no Canonical Bishop, <hi>i. e.</hi> not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically Ordained, yet this notwithstanding the <hi>English</hi> Bishops have true Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Succession. For 1. We need not pretend to derive the Succession of our Bishops from the Popes of <hi>Rome;</hi> 'tis more probable that they are the Successors of St. <hi>Paul</hi> or some other Apostolical Men, who first planted the Gospel here in the Days of the Apostles or soon after: So that we are not concerned at any Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity supposed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Succession. 2. We had Bishops here in <hi>England,</hi> (or <hi>Britain</hi>) long before <hi>Pelagius</hi> was Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> it being certain that some <hi>British</hi> Bishops assisted at the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> held in the days of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> and at that of <hi>Ariminum</hi> called together by <hi>Constantius</hi> his Son, above 200 Years before <hi>Pelagius:</hi> And this Race of Bishops continued even unto <hi>Austin</hi> the Monks coming hither. Whatever then becomes of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Consecration, 'tis no matter to us: His Irregularity affects not our <hi>English</hi> Bishops. 3. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing (what nevertheless is not true) that the Heathen <hi>Saxons,</hi> the <hi>Angli</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> quite extirpated Christianity in this Land, until <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Pope's Commission once more reduced, and brought back the Inhabitants of this Isle unto the belief of the Gospel, and gave us a new line of Bishops: Yet still the Irregularity of <hi>Pelagius'</hi>s Consecration will not at all disparage our Succession of Bishops, as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> knows very well, if he would not dissemble. For I ought to believe that he has read the known History of Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> o'er and o'er, and thoroughly digested him, because he so oft
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:30465:95"/>
and familiarly quotes him in the <hi>Plea,</hi> &amp;c. He may then please to remember that <hi>Austin</hi> was not Created Bishop by Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> but by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France — Interea vir Domini</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinus<note place="margin">

Patris</hi> Gregorii <hi>acceperant, Archiepiscopus Genti</hi> Anglorum <hi>Ordinatus est.</hi> So that from henceforth Mr. <hi>O.</hi> and the Papists may take notice that the <hi>English</hi> Bishops as to the Succession of their Orders, are nothing beholden to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> at least not unto <hi>Pelagius;</hi> that if <hi>Etherius</hi> was a Canonical Bishop (as I must believe till the Contrary is prov'd) so was <hi>Austin</hi> a Canonical Bishop, and so are our <hi>English</hi> Bishops unto this day, whatever becomes of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Consecration. Without any farther fear of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger therefore I may Conclude that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was no Canonical Bishop, that is; was not Canonically Ordained, and yet we have a true Succession of Canonical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordained Bishops in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>O.</hi> goes on—<hi>Or else he was a Canonical Bishop,</hi> and what then? Why then it follows, <hi>a Presbyter has a Canonical Power to Ordain</hi> (for so <hi>Andreas</hi> had, if <hi>Pelagius</hi> was Canonically Ordain'd) and then by another consequence, <hi>that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have an Intrinsick Power to Ordain: Because no Ecclesiastical Laws can give to any Order of Men a Canonical Power to that, which they have not an Intrinsical Power to do.</hi> Supposing this, (for I need not contend the truth of it) the Answer then to the whole Argument is, (as before) that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was not Canonically Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</p>
               <p>But now I think on't, what if a Man should affirm that <hi>Pelagius</hi> was Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically Ordained, and yet assert, that a Presbyter has not an Intrinsical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Ordain? The first Apostolical Canon decrees — <hi>Let a Bishop be Ordain'd by two or three Bishops. Pelagius'</hi>s Consecration therefore was Canonical, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by two Bishops according to this Canoh, and Presbyter <hi>Andreas</hi> may stand for a Cypher. True, the <hi>Nicene</hi> and other Synods afterwards said by three Bishops. Nevertheless the Apostolical Canons being always reckoned as part of the Code of the universal Church, the <hi>Nicene</hi> (and all other) Canons ought in conformity to this to be favourably interpreted, I mean that it did not intend peremptorily to command, but rather prudentially advised that if it could be, a Bishop should be Consecrated by three Bishops. It is not improbable but <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius'</hi>s Consecration was upon this very Account afterwards allow'd of. For this is manifest, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> (what ever his Ordination was) is not reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Schismatical Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but was acknowledged, and peaceably submitted to. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> then is too positive, when he affirms that — <hi>by the Canons three Bishops are absolutely necessary for the Ordination of a Bishop.</hi> Without all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, fewer might serve in cases of Necessity, as this haply afterwards might be judged. If God himself is pleas'd that his own Laws shall submit to those of Necessity, much more the Canons of the Church shall. Wise Men have so determin'd, even in this particular case. <hi>Gregory</hi> declared that <hi>Austin</hi> (notwithstanding the Canons) might himself alone Consecrate Bishops, &amp; <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in</hi> Anglorum <hi>Ecclesia, in qua solus tu Episcopus inveniris, Ordinare Episcopum non aliter nisi sine Episcopis potes</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bede E. H.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 1. c. 27. Resp. 8.</note>. Doubtless, then the meaning of the Canons must be, that in Ordinary, and when it may be with convenience three Bishops are requir'd to the Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Bishop, though even one in the case of Necessity be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30465:96"/>
sufficient. I will not affirm there was a necessity in the case of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was no necessity he should be Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) yet after his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, the wise <hi>Italians</hi> might judge it necessary to overlook the later Canons, and confirm his Consecration rather than create an Anti-Pope, and a Schism in the Church. <hi>Pelagius</hi> then was a Canonical Bishop according to the Apostolical Canon, though not Canonically Ordained according to the strictness of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon.</p>
               <p>But it will be demanded why did not <hi>Pelagius</hi> content himself with two Bishops, but took in a Presbyter to assist in the Ordination? The reason is plain, because <hi>Pelagius</hi> being a wise Man, (as is to be presumed) though not so good as were to be wished, would give his Adversaries as little occasion as was possible to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If therefore he could not get three Bishops, he at least procured two, and a third Person, and so came as near to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon as he could. He observed the number, though not the exact Qualification of the Ordainers, and so vary'd as little from the Rule, as might be. Hereby he made account to impose upon the ignorant Multitude, who 'tis likely were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Spectators of the Solemnity of his Ordination: For the Clergy would not be present to countenance <hi>his</hi> Ordination, whom they hated.</p>

                     </gap>.

This occasioned the dispersion of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and their Settlement in <hi>Austria,</hi> from whence they sent unto the <hi>Greek</hi> Church for the Ordination of their Ministers, and had hopes given them of their obtaining it.

                  <p>Now it was that <hi>Gregory,</hi> an Holy Man, was by the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors tortured; but falling into a Trance, felt no pain, and was believed, dead.

                     <hi>Rome.</hi> They doubted also, whether the Ordination was valid, when a Presbyter, and not a Bishop, Ordained a Presbyter, and that if the Question was once mov'd about it, whether they should be able to defend such an Ordination, either at Home or Abroad. At length, after some Years de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, <hi>viz</hi> 1467. and about 6 Years after the said Vision of <hi>Gregory,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fasted and Pray'd for Direction from God, they resolved upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Course. They chuse nine of the most deserving Brethren, and fittest for the Ministry: They wrap up twelve Tickets, nine whereof were Blanks, and three full ones, having writ on them — <hi>est,</hi> that is to say, as they meant it should signifie — <hi>it is the Will of God;</hi> but the Blanks were to denote it was not the Will of God they should have Bishops. These twelve Tickets being mixed, were delivered to a young Boy, (not knowing what he did) to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed one to every one of those nine Persons. 'Tis manifest that the nine Blank Tickets might every one have been given out unto those nine Persons, from whence it would have been concluded, that what they were about to do, was not the Will of God. But it so hap'ned that the three full Tickets were delivered to three of the nine, <hi>sc.</hi> to <hi>Kunwaldius, Praelausius,</hi> and <hi>Crenovius.</hi> And hence they gathered assuredly, that what they were designing, was the Will of God, <hi>sc.</hi> to seek for Episcopal Orders, and the means of continuing a right Succession of them, and that to that end those three Persons were to be Ordained Bishops. Accordingly they sent three Persons unto the Church of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> who were at that time planted in the Confines of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> acquainting them with what was done, and asking their Advice.

                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:30465:99"/>To conclude, it most be confessed, that <hi>Comenius</hi> says Bishop and Presbyter are one, (I suppose he means have the same Power and Authority <hi>to Minister in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>;</hi> and this is out of all doubt); but withal he intimates that a Bishop is one, who is moreover, an Inspector, or Superintendent, and for this cites <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. His mind is (I suppose) that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 17th <hi>verse,</hi> addressed himself generally to all Presbyters, whether meer Elders, or those who moreover had the oversight of the rest. But in the 28th <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> he turns his Speech unto those, especially, who had been made Bishops. And this is but what the <hi>Syriac</hi> Version seems to imply, wherein (as has already been noted) <hi>verse</hi> the 17th Elders is rendered by <hi>Kashishaa,</hi> which properly, and only signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Elders;</hi> but <hi>verse</hi> the 28th <hi>Episkupea</hi> is used, which denotes Overseers. However this be, if any one carefully observes, what has been before related concerning the Government of the Church of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> it is impossible to conceive but that Bishops (or Seniors) were somewhat more than meer Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Division of Ecclesiastical Officers into three or four Orders, the Power of Ordaining appropriated to Bishops, the great care they had about getting a right Succession of Orders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Bishops, and many other remarkable passages before mentioned, render this point uncontestable:</p>
               <p>From the whole, I think it follows, that the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and the <hi>Fratres Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemi</hi> were governed by Bishops superior to Ministers, or Pastors, long after they were separated from the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatrous Communion; yea that the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses</hi> had Bishops within 150 Years, and less, the <hi>Fratres Bohemi</hi> within 160. that therefore Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is utterly mistaken, who avers that <hi>the</hi> Waldenses <hi>had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers than Presbyters for near</hi> 500 <hi>Years last past, and that Presbyters Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Presbyters without Bishops.</hi> The contrary is most certain, if my Authors have not deceived me. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> was not insensible of this Matter of Fact, of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> deriving their Bishops from the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> but he shuffles us off with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>the</hi> Waldensian <hi>Bishops were only Titular Bishops</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 157.</note>. That is indeed meer Presbyters honoured with the bare Title of Bishops. If Mr. <hi>O.</hi> had not known that remarkable Story about <hi>Zambergius,</hi> and two others, being Ordained Bishops by <hi>Stephen</hi> and another <hi>Waldensian</hi> Bishop, he might possible have been pardonable in some measure for this his rash and groundless Assertion: But seeing he has thus against Knowledge, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In the mean while I'll endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to demonstrate that what he has laid down concerning the <hi>Waldensian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as if they were such in Title only, is a senseless Surmize, altogether false, and no manner of way reconcileable with the Faith of History. For let us but run over the Story once more very briefly, and the truth will appear bright as the Sun at Noon-day. Let it be rembered then, that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> after their Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were a good while supplied from thence with Bishops and Presbyters, who forsaking the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion joyned themselves to that of the Reformed <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and by consequence had been Episcopally Ordained. But the <hi>Bohemians</hi> considering with themselves that it was a very uncertain thing to depend upon such a casual way of having rightly Ordained Ministers, and very much doubting, whether Ordination by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alone, was good and valid, after much deliberation among themselves; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly

                  </gap> of God by Prayer and Fasting upon that Question, Now, if they believed a Presbyter could validly Ordain Presbyters, there had been no need for any thing of this kind. Why should they be deliberating from time to time near Six Years about having Episcopal Orders, and that in a true Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If a Presbyter having the bare Title of Bishop was sufficient to Ordain, there had been no need to have sent <hi>Zambergius</hi> unto the <hi>Waldensians:</hi> It had been but affirming that Bishop and Presbyter is all one, and that the one has Power to Ordain, as well as the other. Why all this Fasting and Praying, and seeking direction from God about a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a Name and Title? What was this but to abuse themselves and the World, and to mock God also with Pretences unto Religion and Tenderness of Conscience, when 'twas nothing but meer Hypocrisie. Let it be farther consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what a device they formed about resolving themselves concerning the Will of God, whether they should seek for a Right Succession of Bishops for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Holy Orders among them. Is it likely they would have us'd so much Precaution against any fraud in the delivery of the Lots and in the Designation of the Persons? And all this only that they might have a true Succession of the Title of Bishop, when they had the Power before. <hi>Zambergius</hi> at least was a Pastor (or Minister or Presbyter) before he was created Bishop by <hi>Stephen.</hi> Could not he have Ordained Presbyters as many as there was need of, and so transmitted the Succession of Holy Orders unto future Generations?

               </p>
               <p>Well, but perhaps Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has not so good an Opinion of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> as he has of the <hi>Waldenses.</hi> 
                  <q>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> perhaps were fond of Bishops, and disi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of a right Succession; and some of the dregs of <hi>Roman</hi> Superssition yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd among them: But the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were nothing so: Their Titular Bishops were nothing but Presbyters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Neither will this do Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s. Work.

How then came the Ministers by joining Hands at their Ordination, to promise Canonical Obedience unto the Bishops? Lastly let it be considered, that the whole Rationale of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Hierarchy, was in all probability taken from the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> from whom their Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy was derived. Besides, if <hi>Stephen</hi> was by Title only a Bishop, but really a Presbyter and no more, how could the <hi>Bohemians</hi> be able hereby to defend their Orders and the Succession of them against their Adversaries abroad (meaning I believe the Papists, when as indeed their Ordinations were meerly Presbyterian, though in Title Episcopal? And what sorry comfort was this to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> that the Three Titular Bishops being returned to their own People could only Acquaint 'em, that they had indeed been Ordain'd by two Titular Bishops, who nevertheless were but Presbyters such as they themselves were before, and to tell you the truth, we have deliberated long upon this business, we have prayed and fasted in vain, and God by answering our sign in the Affirmative has but at last deceived us. We have taken a long and chargeable Journey to the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> but have brought no thing back worthy our pains, but a Word and Empty Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Thus the whole Action was meer Pageantry, a Scene of Imposture, and an Intrigue carried on by Hypocrites on both sides: This must be confessed, if the <hi>Waldensian</hi> Bishops were meerly Titular (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is pleased to say). On the other Hand the History assures us, that the <hi>fratres Bohemi</hi> were exceedingly comforted and encouraged at the return of their Presbyters now created Bishops and deriving their Orders in an uninterrupted Succession from the Apostles, as they believ'd. But at length my Adversary seems to melt a litle and to come half way over to us. He professes thus in his own and Brethren's Name — <q>We dislke not that for Orders sake the Exercise of this Power should be Ordinarily restrained to the Graver Ministers, provided they assume it not as proper to them by Divine Right, nor clog it with unscriptural Impositions.</q> From this Conclusion of Mr. <hi>O.</hi> it follows — 1. That in Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Judgment the Church may restrain the Power of Ordaining, taking the Exercise of it from some of the Yonnger Fry, and lodging it in the Hands of the Graver sort. But the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is, the Younger sort will presently cry our against the Usurpation, they will plead, <q>That they are Presbyters as well as others, and have an Inherent Power to Ordain; that it can't be taken from them by Ecclesiastical Constitutions; that they can't in Conscience part with that Power and Right, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture gives them.</q> And in short will turn all Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Battering Rams against the Graver Ministers, which he has planted against our Bishops, and with more

If Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would be pleased to give me leave to suppose St. <hi>Paul</hi> as Wise as himself, 'tis all I ask. I will suppose then, that the said Apostle for Orders sake did restrain the exercise of the Ordaining Power to some Persons by Him made Choice of, and for the prevention of Schism did prescribe the same Rule unto the Churches, which Mr. <hi>O.</hi> sees some reason for now doubtless then St. <hi>Paul</hi> left not the Power of Ordaining promiscuously unto all Presbyters, but limited it unto a few, I will not say the Graver or Older sort, but the Wiser and most Holy. If Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would nourish this Principle, and make such Deductions from it as 'tis capable of, he would soon see that Episcopal Ordination is Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. But I believe his own Party will conn him no Thanks for this Liberal Concession. Mr. <hi>O.</hi> adds — <hi>and not clog it with unscriptural Impositions.</hi> If there be any Order in a Church some few things must of necessity be imposed: But this is what the Dissenters aim at, that every one may be left at Liberty to say and do what is right in his own Eyes. The Impositions laid upon the Ordained among us are not such as the Bishops themselves alone devised, but the Whole Church consented unto, and though they be not prescrib'd in Scripture, they are not Antiscriptural nor introduc'd into the place of any thing required by the Word of God. In short, did not the Presbyterians when they were in the Saddle clog their Ordinations with unscriptural Impositions? I mean that of taking the Covenant. But this is to carry the Controversy into another Quarter. I shall therefore let it pass.</p>

But to this it may be reply'd, that 'tis only the report of an Adversary, and perhaps may be a Scandal. It may again be answered, that these <hi>Lollards</hi> came too late to prescribe unto the Church in any thing by them practised. It may yet further be said that, when People grope their way in a Dark Night, it is no wonder if they now and then stumble. They are to be both pittied and pardoned. For lastly, 'tis manifest (if the Testimony of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries concerning them be admitted) that the <hi>Lollards</hi> look'd upon even Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as an Order no ways approv'd of by God.

The 4th or 5th Age are the latest we are wont to appeal to, at least under the Title of the Primitive Church. But what? all are Fathers with Mr. <hi>O.</hi> that favour his Opinion, and the Primitive Church will never have an end, so long as any thing can be found conformable to the Presbyterian Discipline.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Boiarians,</hi> or <hi>Bavarians,</hi> who, as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> would have us believe, were once Presbyterians, I will only say thus much in short. I find in their History written by <hi>Jo. Aventinus</hi> Edit. <hi>Basil.</hi> 1580. that from the earliest times of their embracing Christianity they had Bishops, aud long before they submitted their Necks to the Yoke of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontifs. I have made some Collections and Remarks out of the fore-mentioned Historian; but will not trouble my self, or Reader with them. He that is curious, and has a mind to search into the Principles and Practice of this People, may take <hi>Aventinus</hi> into his Hands, and satisfie himself whether ever there was a time when the <hi>Boiarians</hi> were without Bishops, and governed by Presbyters only. It is not indeed the design of this History to treat of this Argument directly; but however, as he goes along, he still occasionally mentions the <hi>Boiarian</hi> Bishops, even before they were brought into subjection to <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <q>That there is no mention made, neither in the Scripture, nor in the Writings of any Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Doctor, or Author of the Church, being within the Times of the Apostles, that Christ did ever make, or consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute any Distinction, or Difference to be in the preeminence of Power, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Jurisdiction, between the Apostles themselves, and the Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but that they were all equal in power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that there is now, and since the time of the Apostles any such diversity. It was devised by the ancient Fathers of the Primitive Church for the Conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Order and Unity in the Catholick Church.</q>
                  <note place="margin">P. 114.</note> From hence Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has gathered (for he refers to <hi>Fox'</hi>s Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rology) <hi>that these Bishops</hi> (the Authors of that Book) <hi>affirm'd the difference of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Presbyters was a Device of the Ancient Fathers, and not mentioned in Scripture.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Deduction is downright false, and directly against the obvious Meaning of the Words. The design of that Prince at that time, was to throw off the Pope, and his Jurisdiction over the Church and Bishops of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> to this end in the Bishops Book 'tis affirmed, that as the Apostles were <hi>equal among themselves,</hi> so were the Bishops <hi>equal among themselves</hi> in the Apostoll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Times, or (according to <hi>Jerom</hi>) that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was not by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right Superior to the Bishop of <hi>Eugubium:</hi> That therefore as I anon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve out of <hi>The King's Book,</hi> Patriarchs, Primates, Metropolitans, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, and particularly, the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had originally no Preeminence and Authority over other Bishops; particularly, not over the <hi>English;</hi> only that it was a voluntury Agreement among themselvs for Orders sake: But from the beginning it was not so. Here is not one word of Presbyters, or exempting them from Subjection unto Bishops. Now, that I have not done the least wrong unto this Book, I appeal to what I find elsewhere, taken thence by Mr. <hi>Strype</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mem.</hi> p. 53.</note>. <q>How that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in no Subjection to the Pope, but to the King's Laws: That Priests and Bishops never had any Authority by the Gospel, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Civil and Moral,</hi> but by Grant and Gift of Princes, that it was always, and ever shall be Lawful unto Kings and Princes, with the Consent of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, to revoke and call again into their Hands, or otherwise, to restrain all the Power and Jurisdiction given, and permitted by their Authority and Assent, and Sufferance, without which, if the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other Bishop whatsoever, should take upon them any Authority, or Jurisdiction in such matters as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Civil,</hi> that Bishop is not worthy the Name, is an Usurper, and Subverter of the Kingdom: That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a Catholick and Apostolick Church, as well as that of <hi>Rome:</hi> That there is no difference in Superiority, Preeminence, or Authority of one (Bishop) over another: But they be all of equal Power and Dignity, and that all Churches be free from the Subjection and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q> The Equality here spoken of in the beginning, and in the latter end of this Period, is not between Bishops and Presbyters in the same Church, but between Bishop and Bishop, Church and Church, and particularly, that no Church (that of <hi>England</hi> especially) is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>Rome.</hi> And though in the beginning he names Priests and Bishops, such Priests haply were meant as took upon them to Act here in <hi>England,</hi> in Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to, and by the Popes Authority; not a Syllable of the Equality of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests is here to be found; only that both depend upon the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and that <hi>in Civil and Moral Matters</hi> only.</p>

this, and some other Books of the same nature, and written with the same design. The <hi>Bishops Book,</hi> otherwise called <hi>The Godly and Pious Institution of a Christian Man,</hi> of which before, came forth again two Years after, <hi>sc.</hi> in the Year 1540. but bearing another Name, <hi>viz. A necessary Doctrine and Erudition for a Christian Man;</hi> Printed also by <hi>Barthelet:</hi> That this also was once more Published in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> and dated <hi>Anno</hi> 1543. as at the end of the said Book, according to the Custom of those Times; though at the bottom of the Title Page I find it dated also 1534. This was composed by <hi>Cranmer;</hi> but called <hi>The King's Book,</hi> because <hi>Hen</hi> VIII recommended it to the People by Proclamation, added to it by way of Preface, and assumed to himself the being the Author of it. Mr. <hi>Strype</hi> farther acquaints me that in the Year 1536. had been published a Book, Entituled <hi>The Bishops Book,</hi> because framed by them; I guess it the same with that I first spoke of, and that it was written by the Bishops <hi>Anno</hi> 1636. but Printed 1637. and he yet tells us of another, which came forth in the Year 1633. also commonly called <hi>The King's Book,</hi> but Entituled, <hi>The Difference between the Kingly and Ecclesiastical Power.</hi> I have procured a sight also of a Latin Book, going under this Title. — <hi>Christiani Hominis Institutio Edit.</hi> 1544. in the Preface whereof, 'tis said to have been at first writ in <hi>English,</hi> and then Translated into Latin, by whom, or by what Authority I find not; and whether this be the same with Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s, I know not; but this is sure, Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s was Printed 1537. as himfelf confesses; mine 1544. and the passage cited by Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is no where to be read in mine. And since nothing like it is to be met with in any of the other Books, and all the Controversy in those times was between the Pope and the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, not about the superiority, or the distinction of Bishops and Presbyters in the same Church, I am apt to fear some foul play. But concerning the Testimony its self, as allowed of, I shall speak more by and by.</p>
               <p>Mean while let us search for what may be had to the purpose in <hi>The King's Book,</hi> Entituled <hi>A necessary Doctrine and Erudition of a Christian Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it shall be said, that Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s Deduction before spoken of, was borrowed not out of the <hi>Kings's Book,</hi> but the <hi>Bishops Book;</hi> yet I hope the one will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to explain the other. Thus then I read in the <hi>King's Book.</hi> — <q>That the Sacrament of Order is a Gift or Grace of<note place="margin">Par. I.</note> Ministration in Christ's Church, given of God to Christian Men, by the Consecration and Imposition of the <hi>Bishops Hands.</hi> That this Sacrament was conferred, and given at the beginning by the Apostles unto Priests and Bishops.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Christiani hominis Institutio,</hi> which I have seen, there is some disagreement to be found: For whereas <hi>the Necessary Doctrine and Erudition,</hi> &amp;c. seems to speak of <hi>two Orders only, i. e.</hi> Priests and Deacons, the <hi>Christiani hominis Institutio,</hi> expresseth it thus — <hi>de his tantum Ordinationibus Presbyterorum &amp; Diaconorum, Scriptura expresse meminit,</hi> &amp;c. meaning, as I suppose, not two Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Church Officers, but two Ordinations or Consecrations of Persons appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Ministry, <hi>sc.</hi> of Presbyters and Deacons: That is, the Consecration of Presbyters and Deacons, is only expresly mentioned in Scripture, and that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops received not any New distinct Imposition of Hands: And so <hi>Orders</hi> in the <hi>necessary Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. is to be understood, as I conceive not of Persons, but of the Ordination of them as 'tis often used unto this Day. It is not then affirm'd in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there was in the Church but two Ranks or Degrees of Ecclesiastical Offices, that is Priests and Deacons, (and not Bishops) according to the Scripture: But that two Consecrations only were expresly mentioned there, nevertheless a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Rank might be found in the Scripture, tho' not separated thereto by a new Imposition of Hands. <hi>MrO'</hi>s quotation seems indeed to sound quite to another Sense, and to his purpose rather, sc. <hi>that in the New Testament no mention is made of other degrees and distinctions</hi> (in Ordinibus) <hi>but of Deacons</hi> (or Ministers) <hi>and of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> (or Bishops) How Ministers and Bishops crept in here, I'll not say: But they are capable still of the same Sence, sc. <hi>that in the New <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

'Tis lastly to be observed, that in the <hi>necessary doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. that we read, that <hi>Patriarchs, Primates Archbishops and Metropolitans, have not now nor ever had Power, Authority and Jurisdiction over other Bishops given them by God in Scripture,</hi> 'tis in the Latin Translation added <hi>cetros<expan>

                  </q> This I doubt not will be own'd a truer and more Scriptural Resolution of the Question then <hi>Cr'</hi>s was.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>To <hi>Quest.</hi> 12 — <hi>Manuum Impositio cum Oratione,</hi> is required unto the making of a Bishop or Priest: So as only appointing it is not sufficient.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet the Judgment of other Learned Men to be seen in Mr. <hi>Strype,</hi> which I will add unto the former.<note place="margin">Id. ibid. 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Quest.</hi> 9th — <q>Making Bishops has two parts, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and Ordination. Appointment, which by necessity the Apostles made by Common Election, and sometime by their own Assignment, could not be done by Christian Princes, because there were none; yet now appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them: But in Ordering wherein Grace is conferred, the Apostles followed the Rule taught by the Holy Ghost, <hi>per Manuum Impositionem cum Oratione &amp; Jejunio.</hi>
                  </q> A more solid and Judicious Answer then <hi>Cranmer'</hi>s.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Quest.</hi> 10 — <q>Christ made the Apostles first both Priests and Bishops, but whether at one time some doubt. After that the Apostles made both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests, the names whereof in the Scripture be confounded.</q> They manifestly imply a real distinction between them, in the beginning, though they were one in Name, or rather though both were called by both Names indifferently.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Quest.</hi> 11 — <q>The Bishop having Authority from his Prince to give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, may by his Ministry given to him of God in Scripture Ordain a Priest, and we read not that any other not being a<note place="margin">N. B.</note> Bishop hath since the beginning of Christ's Church Ordained a Priest. <hi>N. B.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Quest.</hi> 12 — <q>Only Appointment is not sufficient, but Consecration, that is to say, Imposition of Hands with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and prayer is also required. For so the Apostles used to Order them that were appointed, and so has been used continually, and we have not read the contrary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>From the whole it appears, that what ever was <hi>Cranmer'</hi>s Opinion, yet others were of a contrary Mind: It cannot then be truly affirm'd, that <hi>Cranmer'</hi>s was the Judgment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as farther may be confirmed by what Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi> reply'd at the same time unto the Queries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:30465:105"/>
                  <q>1. I suppose, that a Bishop has according to the Scripture Power from God as being his Minister to create the Presbyter, although he ought not to promote any one unto the Office of a Presbyter or admit him to any Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ministry, unless the Princes leave be first obtained in a Christian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Wealth. But that any other Person has according to the Scripture Power to create the Presbyter, I have not read nor learned from any Instance. 2. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Consecration by laying on of Hands is necessary: For so we are taught by the Examples of the Apostles.</q> Thus much Dr. <hi>Durel,</hi> who read the whole MS. by the permission of Mr. <hi>St.</hi> reports out of it<note place="margin">

An.</hi> c. 28. p. 328.</note> in his <hi>Vindiciae Ecclesiae Angli.</hi> The Judgment then of <hi>Cranmer</hi> set forth in that MS. cannot with any Truth be ascribed to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> it was the Opinion but of some Persons, from which their Contemporaries we see differed much.</p>
               <p>But, 2. the Argument grounded on the MS. belongs not to the time when the Church of <hi>England</hi> was Protestant. So that the Resolution of those Queries were rather of the Popish Church of <hi>England.</hi> For the Questions were not put by <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. as was at first surmized, but by <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. To make out which note.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Manuscript has no date, nor any King named in it, that called the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at <hi>Windsor.</hi> One may then ascribe it to the Father <hi>Henry,</hi> as well as to the Son <hi>Edward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Cranmer</hi> submits himself and his Sentence unto the Judgment of the King. But <hi>Edward</hi> VI. was a Child too young, and unexperienced to ask these Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to have the final decision of them referred to him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The Statute, doubtless, speaks of all Priests and Ministers, whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, or Dissenters: All were to Assent and Subscribe, in case they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in, or be let into any Ecclesiastical Promotion: But chiefly the Papists. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> first, I assert this upon Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s own words. — <hi>The Ministry of the Papists</hi> (says he) <hi>was a real Priest hood, and therefore they call their Presbyters, Priests.</hi> On the contrary, I do not remember that Dissenting Ministers have ever been stiled Priests in any publick Instrument of Church or State. Now as for the word <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> even that also (it may be) points at the Popish Priests; for it had lately been used among the Papists. I meet with it in <hi>Smith'</hi>s Recantation<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Memor.</hi> p. 171.</note>; in the <hi>necessary Doctrine,</hi> and other publick Records, But chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I consider that at the time of this Act of Parliament the Popish Priests herded themselves among the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Flock, as well as to curb the Dissenters themselves, <hi>Ministers</hi> was thought a fit Word to be added unto the Act, to the end none might escape subscribing. Mr. <hi>O'</hi>s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> here turns upon himself, whilst he distinguishes, where the Law does not, contrary to that wise rule of Interpreting Laws. Besides, these Words in the Statute — <hi>Who pretend to be Priests or Ministers by reason of any other form of Institution or Consecration or ordering than the</hi> English <hi>then in force</hi> do in my Opinion, plainly and more openly strike at the Popish Ordinations, the Great Design of that Reign, especially in the beginning, being to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the <hi>Romish</hi> Priests.</p>
               <p>It may be urg'd — <q>That the Dissenting Ministers by subscribing those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which only belong unto the Confession of the true Christian Faith, were to be admited or continued in their Benefices, and by consequence their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations allowed, though they did not declare their Assent unto the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Traditions, nor to the 20th and 36th Article of Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This cannot be: For I shall shew anon that they were oblig'd to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe those two Articles, which if they did <hi>ex animo,</hi> they must of necessity forth with enter into Episcopal Orders, and approve of and use Church Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which was what the Statute aim'd at.</p>
               <p>Nor (as Mr. <hi>O.</hi> argues) does the subscription seem to intend those only, who scrupled Traditions and Ceremonies, and not the other Doctrines in the 39, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which was the case of the Dissenters alone. For the Papists scruple, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of the 39, Articles, which also were to be assented unto, but were not scrupled by the Presbyterian Dissenters (though other Dissenting Ministers haply did); and though the Papists scruple not Ceremonies and Traditions in General, yet they scruple ours in particular: By consequence were intended in the Act, as much and more then the Dissenters.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>O.</hi> 
                  <q>Because the Assent and Subscription was only to the Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion concerning the Confession of the true Christian Faith, and Doctrine of the Sacraments, therefore an Indulgence was intended the Dissenting Ministers, who scrupled nothing else but Ceremonies and the Book of Consecration which belonging not to the Christian Faith, are not required to be subscribed and assented to, and by consequence Ordination by Presbyters was here allowed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> All I have to do is to prove that the 20th and 36th Articles among the 39, were by this Statute required to be subscribed and assented to. And thus I prove it. 'Tis manifest that the 39 Articles are meant in this Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> from these Words in the Act — — <q>Articles agreed to by the Archbishops and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of both Provinces, and the Whole Clergy in Convocation <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. for avoiding diversities of Opinions in Religion.</q> Oh! but (cries Mr. <hi>O.</hi>) 'tis meant of such Articles only, as concerned <hi>the Confession of the true Christian Faith,</hi> which the two aforesaid Articles did not, all the rest being opposed (it seems) unto the 20th and 36th Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is very absur'd in my Judgment to Interpret Acts of Parliament in so loose a manner, which are wont to speak more correctly, and with greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness; and if this had been intended the Statute would certainly have excepted the two Articles. I rather believe the Articles of Religion here mentioned, are opposed to other Articles of the Queen's setting forth in

               <p>Moreover by Ceremonies we commonly understand things of meer Humane or Ecclesiastical Institution: These indeed considered every one singly by it self belong not to the true Christian Faith.

               <p>The Book of Consecration confirmed in the 36th Article, contains the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Rule of Ordination by Bishops, and so concerns the true Christian Faith: It was then to be assented unto. Finally, that I have not mistaken the Sense of the Statute or the Lawgivers Intendment, I will support my Interpretation by the Judgment of the great Oracle of the Law, and other Reverend Judges before him. <q>Subscription required of the<note place="margin">

Hereby then 'tis apparent, that this Act intended no indulgence unto the Dissenters, nor allowance of Presbyterian Orders.</p>
               <p>In King <hi>James</hi> the first's Reign, was publish'd a Book entituled <hi>Tractatus de Politia Ecclesiae Anglicanae,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Mocket</hi> the then Archbishop's Chaplain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Author annex'd <hi>Jewels</hi> Apology, the greater and less Catechisms, the Publick <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the 39 Articles of Religion and the Homilies. Now because <hi>Blondel</hi> builds upon these, I ought at least to examine the Treatise and the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms. The latter, I cannot get a sight of, and shall at present only look into the former, from whence it may be Collected — <q>That the Office of a Bishop is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30465:107"/>
twofold. The first has respect unto all the Faithful of the Whole Flock: The second unto the Ministers of the Church. As to the former it is acknowledged that Bishop and Presbyter are the same Degree of Office or Order, or call it what you please. For the Presbyters Minister unto the People as effectually, as the Bishops in all the Offices and Conveyances of Divine Grace: And on this account are the Successors of the Apostles, as much as the Bishops are. The Presbyters Administer the Sacraments, Preach the Word, interpret Scripture, reprove, exhort, incourage, and comfort, publish and declare Authoritative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Ministerially the promise of the Remission of Sin, and Eternal Life by Jesus Christ, not only in the Sermons, but after Solemn Confession of Sin, and in the Visitation of the Sick, and of such as have been troubled in Mind and Conscience. In short, to them in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Administrations, appertains that Principal Gift and Commission — <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost: Whose Sins ye remit they are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far Bishops and Presbyters are the same, or, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> has it, <hi>pene Idem gradus.</hi> This is not to be doubted of: For so they the Presbyters are the same with the Apostles. But the peculiar and distinguishing Character, and Office of the Bishop is to inspect, Govern and Ordain Presbyters and succeeding Bishops. On this account the Presbyter (as <hi>Jerom</hi> also speaks) is <hi>secundus gradus.</hi>
                  </q> Thus much we own and freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, let our Adversaries make the best of it they can. I do suppose the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Preeminence, and Superiority of Bishops from and over Prebyters, and their Ordaining Power is sufficiently cleared to have been the Doctrine of the reformed Church of England from the beginning, though <hi>Blondel</hi> would pick out of this Treatise something to the Contrary, which is not my business here to take to task.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I shall only produce the Testimony of the <hi>English</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Acta. Syn. Dor. in the Rem.</hi> of Mr. <hi>Jo. Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton.</hi>
                  </note> Divines in the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> held 1618. 1619. The Bishop of <hi>Landaff, Joseph Hall</hi> (afterwards Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi>) <hi>John Davenant,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> having approv'd all the Doctrines in the <hi>Belgick</hi> confession except Three Heads concerning Ecclesiastical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders protested — <hi>That the Government of the</hi> English <hi>Churches by Bishops, Priests and Deacons, was of Apostolical Institution.</hi> Particularly <hi>Landaff</hi> in a Speech ran through the three Heads or Chapters, and then entred this Protestation, <hi>that there was not in the Apostles Times nor ever had been in the Church an Equality of Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the whole I gather 1. That it has ever been the Judgment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Reformation, that there was by the Scripture and ought to be an inequality of Ministers, and that Bishops are distinct from and Superiour to Presbyters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Presbyterians and Particularly Mr. <hi>O.</hi> do a great injury unto the Memory of that Great Man Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and through his sides un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly Wound all that defend and assert Divine right of Episcopacy, impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of Novelty and altering the Doctrine of the Church. That Renowned Prelate came into Play, and became a Leader in this Church not till after all the Instances, which I have alledged in proof of the Divine Right of Bishops: Even the Bishop of <hi>Landaff</hi> and his <hi>English</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues at the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> were not Inferior to him; nor was it in <hi>Laud'</hi>s Power to Influence their Opinions. He was not Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> till the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:30465:108"/>
Year 1633. not of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> till 1621. two Years after the Synod was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up. It cannot therefore with Reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> thought, that these excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who assisted at that Assembly, were led by the Nose, or aw'd by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Dr. Laud.</hi> Nor do I find that he was any ways interested in their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations, or that he sent to them any Letters, or Dispatches upon that, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any other subject. It can hardly be believed, since so many of the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistical</hi> Points were then established, doubtless, to the regret of this Prelate. Besides, Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> had before <hi>Laud,</hi> written a Book to prove the Divine Right of Bishops, surely not sway'd thereto by <hi>Laud,</hi> who was, or had been his Chaplain.</p>
               <p>But to remove all the invidious Calumnies and Reproaches, that have been falsly laid upon that unfortunate Prelate, and the rest, who before, and after him, have maintained the Divine Right of Bishops, it were sufficient to call to remembrance, that it was the Doctrine of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whose Testimonies 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to repeat any more: also of St. <hi>Cyprian, Jâm pridem per omnes Provincias &amp; Urbes Ordinati sunt (Episcopi)</hi> and what he<note place="margin">S. <hi>Cyp.

But why these failings and defects should be laid in the balance with the undoubted Testimonies of the Fathers, or prejudice the Wisdom and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of others, yea the Publick and Authoritative Declarations of our Church too, is beyond my Capacity to comprehend. This is out of question (I judge) that Presbyterian Ordination, the Identity and Parity of Bishops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, has never yet been pronounced lawful, much less of Divine Right, by any Publick and AuthentickSentence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> since the Reformation except haply by that pack't Assembly of Divines, not one of whom were Legally chose to sit at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Some private Writers may haply be found inclining to the Opinion, whereby Presbyters are equal'd unto Bishops, and thought to be of the same Degree; but I make no reckoning of such private Authorities, though they were otherwise Persons of singular Learning, Wisdom and Piety: And some Passages favouring the Presbyterian Pretences may possibly be found in the publick Deliberations and Conclusions, whilst <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. was Vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Church from the Tyranny of the Pope, and in his stead assuming it to himself. Thus far we chang'd our Rider, not our Burthen; but it ought to be considered, that as in those difficult times the Episcopal Power was subjected to the will of the Prince, and to the Law of the Land, and so may be thought not by Divine Right, but Humane Constitution; even so was the Power and Office of Parsons, Vicars and Priests, or Presbyters, and from thence also it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with equal Force, that these also are but by Humane Law, and thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their Authority. Let us for example but look back unto <hi>Cranmer'</hi>s Answer
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:30465:108"/>
to the King's 9th <hi>Query,</hi> and we may be convinced hereof. The substance of it is — <q>That the whole care of the Church is immediately committed to the Prince. That Parsons, Vicars, and other Priests, were to be appointed by His Highness to their Ministrations. <hi>To the</hi> 10<hi>th Query,</hi> that the Prince may make a Priest.</q> He that will infer hence, that according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at that time, Bishops were not <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> but by the Law of the Land, must be also forced to conclude, that Priests and Ministers hold by the same Tenure and no other: And from the whole it will follow that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was in the right, when he affirms the Will and Laws of the Prince to be the Standard of the Peoples Religion.

                  </gap> Protestant Churches, and called upon to have a more favourable, charitable, and just Opinion of them, and their Ministry. Hereunto it will suffice me only to answer with St. <hi>Paul, What have I to do to judge them that are without?</hi> But I farther consider with what Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties they at first struggled, and still labour under, and am apt to think that the same good God that would have <hi>Mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> and so dispensed with his own appointed Sabbath, may (and I hope) will accept their Sacrifices, though they be not <hi>prepared according to the purification of the sanctuary.</hi> I also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that the Foreign Protestants are by this time, (many of them, even the most Learned) quite Captivated by a long Prejudice, which the continuance of the Presbyterian Government among them for so many Years, since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation has now perhaps, rendred unconquerable, and that therefore God may (and I hope does) wink at this Ignorance; for such I reckon an inveterate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to be. Besides, though many of the Foreign Protestant Ministers have Zealously defended the Presbyterian Government, and seem not at all willing, or inclined to Model themselves into the Episcopal Platform, though it were in their power, and opportunity served; yet others of them have been contrary minded, and even in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I will not here mention the <hi>French</hi> Letters written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the present Honourable, and Right Reverend Bishop of <hi>London.</hi> Mr. <hi>O.</hi> has most maliciously Suggested as if the Authors were Brib'd, or by some indirect means induc'd to write as they did.

                     </gap>,</hi> but it seems mist his aim: That he was afterwards hired by the Presbyterians to write for them against Episcopacy. Thus Revenge and the Love of Money were the Parents of that Celebrated Book entituled — <hi>Apologia pro Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymi Sententia:</hi> And Lastly, that even in the Apology its self some things were intermixed, which undid and overthrew all he seemed to have advanced in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Presbytery: Which therefore he was forced to expunge before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Promised Reward of his Labour. But after this let us now hear what a Learned Protestant, a Foreign Divine has written upon this Subject, I mean <hi>Peter Du Moulin,</hi> in a Letter to a <hi>Scotch</hi> Man <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. He says — <q>That
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:30465:109"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Protestant Church never put down Bishops (p. 6.) nor encouraged others to do it: That necessity not Choice keeps 'em from setting up Episcopal Order: That at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where Episcopacy was changed into the Presbyterian Form, necessity bore more sway than Council, and Policie than Divinity: That the Reformation in <hi>France</hi> began among the People, in <hi>Scotland</hi> (and <hi>England</hi>) at Court: No wonder then that due Regard was not had unto the Primitive Government in the one as well as the other, that the <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants have much ado to maintain their Ministers by reason of their Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: That if they should establish Bishops, it would provoke their Adversaries and raise them to Jealousy, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> would look more like direct Schism, two Bishops being at the same time in oneSee: That they are a Body prepar'd for Bishops, when Bishops will reform: He gives an Instance, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the Bishop in his Cathedral preach'd the pure Word of God, and the Protestants submitted to him. He farther Apologizes, that their King will not suffer them to have Bishops.</q> I only add, hereunto Bishop <hi>Hall's</hi> Observation, how that, when our Bishop of <hi>Landaff</hi> at<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Div. Right of Episco.</hi> p. 9.</note> the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> charg'd the Divisions there (in <hi>Holland</hi>) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their want of Episcopacy he received this only in Answer — <hi>Domine nos non sumus adeo faelices.</hi> Whether this was spoken by way of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest excuse, and a tacit approbation of Bishops, I know not of certaitny; but believe so; at least I look upon it as a shifting off the Question about Episcopacy the President not caring to enter into the Lists with the Bishop upon that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if he intended it (as perhaps Mr. <hi>O.</hi> will think) for a Scoff, I will take the Liberty to say, that as the High-Priest prophesied a great Truth but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it not, neither understood it; so might the President too stumble upon a great Truth, and intimate Episcopacy to be the Happiness of a Church, tho' at the same time he was otherwise perswaded or did not discern it. For there are a sort of Creatures, which cannot endure the Light, and by how much clearer the Sun shines see so much the worse: Like <hi>Saul</hi> going to <hi>Damascus</hi> before his Conversion, are struck blind with the Glory and Lustre of Truth which sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds them. This we are assured of by manifold and woful Experience, and therefore need not wonder at it. The Eyes of the Understanding labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same natural Weakness, as those of the Body do. When we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long in the dark or have shut our Eyes for somewhile, we are not able to behold the Objects of Sense, though placed at their proper distance, and in a Medium duly fitted for their Reception. Thus when Pride, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Prepossession, when Passion, Sturdiness and Secular Interest, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiousness Opposition, and Hatred have for some time drawn a veil over the Understanding, it is not easy for these Men to admit any Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that thwart and contradict those, which they have for a long time before entertained, let the Evidence brought for their Conviction be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so bright and clear. For instance, Mr. <hi>O.</hi> as has been noted in the former Chapter has frankly acknowledged it as fit and warrantable, that some Grave Divines be set over the Churches for Peace and Order sake, whilst the Younger sort are for the present to be excluded or suspended from the exercise of their Inherent Power. Now Mr. <hi>O.</hi> is not able (I perceive) to see, that this very reasonable Concession of his, if rightly pursu'd and improved as it ought; puts an end unto the Controvery. For though he has so frequently and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30465:109"/>
at every turn declared against Ecclesiastical Restraints, yet here he allows 'em, and supposes it in the Power of the Church to restrain some from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Power, and to reserve the Cheif care and Government of the Church, to a few of the most Eminent. Here I say, then the Cudgels are in effect laid down, and Episcopacy is sufficiently vindicated and approved of by the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himself, though before he is aware. No! it will be replyed; for still care must be taken, that it be not however admitted, as of Divine Right. Well! But if an Ecclesiastical Right be sufficient to oblige us unto Obedience to our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors (as in the concession its self he must suppose) then have our Reverend Bishops a good Title to their own Power, and to our subjection to 'em. Besides, how easy is it to improve this Concession even to the Vindication of the Divine Right of Bishops? For if Mr. <hi>O.</hi> (who, when he suffers himself to think, is, I am hereby convinc'd, a Wise Man, and sees far before Him) will but turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about and look the other way, that is behind him: I mean, will but admit St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apostles heretofore to have been as wise as himself is now, it would be no hard matter (one would imagine) to convince him presently of the Divine, that is, Apostolical Constitution of Bishops. If it is now, it was also in the Apostles Days fit, and reasonable to commit the care and Government of the Churches unto some Grave and Worthy Presbyters: And if so, can we possibly believe the Apostles did not appoint what their own Reason and Prudence suggested to them?</p>
               <p>But let us pass to another Instance. Mr. <hi>Stoddon</hi> in his Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Charge, has confessed<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Past.

Something of this kind I have in the precedent Papers offered my self, and could farther confirm it out of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> if it were worth the while and suited my Design. But Mr. <hi>Stoddon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain distinguishes between what is primarily, and what is <hi>secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>jure Divino,</hi> as Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> long before him has done: And to be short, is of Opinion that the Clergy has as much need to have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour set over them as the Common People themselves, and that if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture has not expresly appointed it, yet the reason and necessity of the thing does absolutely require it, or to this effect (for at present I have not the Book by me): And surely the Apostles knew this and by Experience too, as well as Mr. <hi>Stoddon.</hi> Now I cannot comprehend what should hinder this Gentleman coming over to us, but the inveterate Prejudices, which he cannot part with, or a stiffness and aversion to change his Opinions, for which his Old Friends would be sure to reproach him without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

One may happily comfort incourage and confirm some in the Truth, which they already know and profess: But to convert any, there are very little hopes, seeing most Men have an overweening Opinion of themselves, and the Party which they have espous'd. There I leave them, not expecting they will be reclaim'd from the evil of their way, till God shall open their Eyes, and by some secret and powerfull Influence dispose their Hearts unto the knowledge and acknowledgment of the Truth, or else by some visible Judgments and Afflictions constrain us unto Unity, which is the only thing some Men are afraid of. They have not stuck to declare,

                  </head>
                  <p>THere is an Objection which escaped me in its proper place, and therefore must here be considered, 'tis, <hi>that Presbyterian Orders have been allowed here in</hi> England, <hi>that</hi> Peter Martyr, Bucer, P. Fagius, <hi>&amp;c. were suffered to exercise their Ministry among us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Allowances against an Establish'd Law are not very defensible, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when that Law was believed to be of Divine Right, which is the Case here before us of Ordination by Bishops, let this then be put among the Infirmities and mistakes of our first Reformers. 2. Our first Reformers might think it justifiable in Charity to Foreign Protestant Churches, which had not the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Episcopal Ordination; the present necessities and Service of the Church required it: The Reformation otherwise would have received some stop or Prejudice by bringing this Point into Controversy. For some such like Reason as this it was, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of K. <hi>James</hi> I. sent Delegates unto the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and contented her self after the Conclusions there made only to enter her Protestations against the Parity of Ministers. 3. Our first Reformers haply went upon this Principle, <hi>He that is not against us is for us,</hi> and such were <hi>Peter Martyr, Bucer, Fagius,</hi> &amp;c. But our Dissenters were always <hi>against us,</hi> making it their whole business to overturn the Ecclesiastical Government of this Nation by railing, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and representing it as Popish and Anti-Christian. 4. The Indulgence spoken of had in it perhaps more of State Policy than true Divinity, and is to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd as the Act of the Civil Government rather, than of the Church. Thus the <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> and <hi>Huguenot</hi> Ministers have ever even to this day been permitted to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate in Divine Things without Episcopal Orders. 5. All these Indulgences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> not amount to the destroying the Truth of that Principle concerning the Divine Right of Episcopacy. Forasmuch as the Relaxation of the Execution of a positive Law cannot in Reason be accounted the annulling or abolition of that Law, as we see at this Day, when Liberty is given to the very Dregs of Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical and Fanatical Sectaries, which is no more Prejudice unto Episcopacy, than 'tis to other acknowledg'd Truths of the Gospel. 6. As for those particular Persons allowed to exercise their Minstry here in <hi>England</hi> we may note, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr</hi> was in Episcopal Orders, and it may be others of them were also. But there is a story which I am obliged to take notice of because Mr. <hi>B.</hi> my
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30465:110"/>
first Adversary objected it to us. He affirmed, <hi>the Protestant Bishops of</hi> England <hi>formerly approved of Presbyterian Ordination,</hi> as he inferred from a Passage about the Ordination of Bishop <hi>Spotswood</hi> and Others. The Case was this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>In the Year 1609 some <hi>Scotchmen</hi> were to be Ordained Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Spots. Hist. of Sc.</hi> p. 514. 3<hi>d Edit.</hi>
                        </note> and a Synod was held by our <hi>English</hi> Bishops for that purpose, Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> said, that they ought first to be Ordained Presbyters as having not been Ordained by Bishops but by Presbyters <hi>only. Bancroft</hi> Archbishop of <hi>C.</hi> maintained, that there was no necessity of that, because where Bishops could not be had Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation though by Presbyters (<hi>only,</hi>) must be esteemed lawful, else it might be doubted, whether there was any lawful Vocation in most of the Reformed Churches.</q> This applauded to by the other Bishops, <hi>Ely</hi> acquiesc'd.</p>
                  <p>From hence I inferr, not that the Protestant Bishops of <hi>England</hi> approved of Presbyterian Ordination, but that in the Judgment of this <hi>English</hi> Synod, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but necessity can justify it; now what Degree of necessity is requisite, I'll not here dispute. 2. That where Episcopal Ordination may be had there Presbyterian Ordination is unlawful. 3. That the necessity here pleaded in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Presbyterian Orders implies, that Episcopal Ordination is of Divine Right: otherwise it had been impertinent to excuse Presbyterian Ordination, only from the necessity of it.</p>
                  <p>But I crave leave to interpose my own Judgment, and I humbly conceive there was no need of flying unto this Refuge of necessity, for still the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen might have proceeded, <hi>Salvo etiam Episcopalis Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis Jure Divino;</hi> for I do affirm that by the practice of the Church a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be immediately elevated into the Throne, and effectually receive the Episcopal Character without being first Ordained Deacon and Priest. This latter is indeed more safe and regular in Ordinary: Nevertheless in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cases, the former has been practised. Thus the Learned Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> has observed, that Monks were wont to be made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops<note place="margin">Prim.
