         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Life and Character of <hi>Juvenal.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>ECIUS JUNIUS JUVENAL</hi> was born at <hi>Aquinum</hi> in <hi>Campania;</hi> his father (some say his foster-father) a rich freed-man of that town, bred him a Scholar, and designed him for a Lawyer. In order whereunto, he heard the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator <hi>Quintilian,</hi> declaming under him (according to <hi>Divaeus</hi>) till he was of middle age. Then, being Heir to a Fortune, therefore not necessitated to make Law his Profession, he wholly applied himself to the study of Moral Philosophy; and by that rule measuring the actions of his Countreymen the <hi>Romans,</hi> which then gave as well the Example, as the Law to all Nations, he found nothing so needfull for the corrupted World, as Reformation of Manners. This he resolved to make his businesse, not by inflicting a penalty like the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, but by showing the uglinesse of Vice as a Satyrist, in Imitation of <hi>Lucilius:</hi> yet so far out-doing his Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
<pb facs="tcp:93027:4"/>
that he read his Satyres publickly, not alone with the general applause of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> but even <hi>Quintilian</hi> himself (as we may probably collect from the tenth book of his Institutions) became his hearer and admirer. Yet <hi>Paris,</hi> another of his Auditors, was not so taken with his seventh, though it sets forth his high and mighty Munificence to the Poets, in this manner,</p>
            <l>Many to honour in the warres He brings;</l>
            <l>Puts Summer-Annulets and Winter-Rings</l>
            <l>On Tragick Poets fingers; what, there lives</l>
            <l>No Lord that will bestow, this Player gives.</l>
            <l>Do'st thou attend the <hi>Camerini</hi> then,</l>
            <l>And <hi>Bareae?</hi> a fig for Noble men,</l>
            <l>Write Tragedies; 'tis <hi>Pelopea</hi> takes,</l>
            <l>She Praefects; <hi>Philomela</hi> Tribunes makes.</l>
            <p>It seems, the word <hi>Player</hi> was more then <hi>Paris</hi> could digest; who, to revenge himself upon the Satyrist, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his great Master <hi>Domitian Caesar,</hi> to bestow upon <hi>Juvenal</hi> a Regiment of Foot in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> This was a pretty handsome return form'd by <hi>Paris</hi> out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry subject of his anger, bandying, as well as he could, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr for Satyr, by making <hi>Juvenal</hi> one of his Tribunes,
<pb facs="tcp:93027:4"/>
or Poet-Colonels. An old Manuscript relates it thus, <hi>The Emperour</hi> Domitian <hi>displeased with</hi> Juvenal, <hi>for touching upon his favours to the Player</hi> Paris; <hi>yet not thinking it fit to put any publick affront upon a man of that integrity of life, banished him, under the name of an honourable imployment in his service, making him</hi> Praefect <hi>of a</hi> Cohort <hi>in</hi> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. <hi>A</hi> Commentator saies, this Imployment broke the heart of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> but sure he dream't it; for, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> (no more troubled at his Colonel-ship then I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press him in the <hi>16th</hi> design) out-lived his back-friend <hi>Paris</hi> and likewise <hi>Domitian</hi> himself, as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the close of his fourth Satyr,</p>
            <l>But He was lost; when once the Clown began</l>
            <l>To fear him, he reveng'd the Noble man.</l>
            <p>How many years he survived his banishment, may be easily calculated from these words Sat. <hi>13.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Is this newes to one born when <hi>Capito</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Was Consul, above threescore years ago?</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now reckon threescore years from the Consulship of <hi>L. Fonteius Capito</hi> Collegue with <hi>C. Vipsanius</hi> in the year from the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> eight hundred and
<pb facs="tcp:93027:5"/>
twelve, you shall find, that not onely <hi>Domitian</hi> was dead, and the short reign of <hi>Nerva</hi> ended, but also the <hi>21</hi> years of <hi>Trajan;</hi> and in the second of <hi>Hadrian, a. u. D.CCC.LXX.II.</hi> he writ the <hi>13th</hi> Satyr to <hi>Calvinus,</hi> dying afterwards in the bosome of his Countrey, crowned with white <hi>hairs</hi> and <hi>Lawrel,</hi> Emblems of mortality common to all men, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Fame, the consequent of his peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.</p>
            <p>And here, I know it will be wished, that <hi>Juvenal,</hi> from whose hands we have the <hi>Characters</hi> of men of all conditions, had left us his <hi>own;</hi> and I believe he would have done it, if he might have commended himself: to which (in that case) truth would have obliged him. But, this not befitting him and well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming me; I shall shall deliver my Author, as his Life, his own Works, and others of unquestioned authority, represent him to me.</p>
            <p>He was <hi>born</hi> or <hi>made</hi> heir to a good Estate, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued a better, for using the gifts of fortune with such moderation, as that he neither lived poor, in hope to dye rich, nor exceeded the measure of his purse, either
<pb facs="tcp:93027:5"/>
at his Feasts or Sacrifices. He was bred up a <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician,</hi> and arrived to that perfection in his Art, that where he writes of any thing handled by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Orators, he addes new matter and form, more delightfull and more usefull to the world: but where he ends, it will be hard to show another, since his time, that ever raised upon his grounds any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable superstructure. He is an Author of so clear and supreme a Judgement, that no other did ever make choice of nobler Arguments, nor writ so many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims or Sentences, that, like the lawes of nature, are held sacred by all Nations.</p>
            <p>He was a Judge of manners, so incorrupted, that his Enemy, though favourite to <hi>Caesar</hi> and the Court-Informer, could not find matter against him for a charge of defamation. In short, he was a Politician for the benefit of Mankind, disguising <hi>Morality</hi> under the vizzard of a <hi>Satyr</hi>; for which he had his warrant from <hi>Plato</hi> in these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>It is the highest point of Science, to</hi> be, <hi>yet not to</hi> seem <hi>a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and to do serious things in jest.</hi> Thus divine
<pb facs="tcp:93027:6"/>
               <hi>Plato,</hi> the scourge of Hypocrites, that calls it <hi>the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est injustice, when a man seems just, and is not so,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of this Philosophical dissimulation; whereby the vulgar, laughing at Vice and Folly, are cozened into Wisdome and Virtue; in this Mystery no Artist ever came near to <hi>Juvenal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that, with the bitter-sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his <hi>Satyrs,</hi> not like <hi>Philip's</hi> 'Prentice, but like <hi>Galen</hi> himself, cures the most desperate Patients, by pleasure opening the way to recovery.</p>
            <p>To justifie this Character I could bring a Catalogue of witnesses, all great Authors of his time, or ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, that I may not detain you too long in the <hi>Portico</hi> of his <hi>work,</hi> these out of many shall suffice. In the first place, his Rhetorick-Master <hi>Quintilian,</hi> enumerating the <hi>Latine</hi> Satyrists, <hi>admires</hi> Lucilius, <hi>praises</hi> Horace, <hi>honours</hi> Persius, then adds, <hi>but after all these we have</hi> Juvenal; a greater elegancy <hi>I</hi> observe not in all the works of that learned Orator, marshalling his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, then living, in his true place among the Satirysts, last in time, and first in merit. The next is <hi>Martial,</hi> that sends him a present of nuts with this Epigram, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his Eloquence,</p>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:93027:6"/>
De nostro facunde tibi <hi>Juvenalis</hi> agello,</l>
            <l>Saturnalicias mittimus ecce nuces!</l>
            <l>Caetera lascivis donavit poma puellis</l>
            <l>Mentula custodis luxuriosa dei.</l>
            <l>Eloquent <hi>Juvenal,</hi> I send to thee</l>
            <l>Saturnalitian Nuts: my store you see;</l>
            <l>The wanton God, my Ortyard-keeper, trades</l>
            <l>With fruit, and gave the Apples to the Maids.</l>
            <p>To come from the <hi>Romans</hi> to the best of our modern Censors, <hi>Julius Caesar Scaliger</hi> sets his mark upon <hi>PERSIUS for an affected and fantastick writer, boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an aguish kind of Learning, ambitious to be read, yet not desirous to be understood, though now decyphered to a tittle: whereas</hi> Juvenal <hi>is elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and clear, absolutely the Prince of</hi> Satyrists, <hi>so exact in all he writes, that nothing is censurable by the Criticks.</hi> Then comparing him with <hi>Horace,</hi> he calls him a <hi>jeerer, content to give his</hi> Satyres <hi>the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> Sermones, Discourses, <hi>inserting some loose sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences as it were in common talk, yet studied: not regarding how his Verses ran; but so that he spake pure</hi> Latine, <hi>his work was done: In</hi> Juvenal, <hi>all things are quite contrary, when he is in fury, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults and kills; his style is extreme handsome, wherein together with the purest</hi> Latine, <hi>he hath
<pb facs="tcp:93027:7"/>
the happiness of incomparable Transitions: his Verse is far better then</hi> Horace, <hi>his sentences no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, he speaks things more to life;</hi> and (comparing the <hi>Roman</hi> Satyrists) <hi>Scaliger</hi> concludes, <hi>that</hi> Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>is to be preferred before</hi> Horace, <hi>by as many degrees as</hi> Horace <hi>is to be preferred before</hi> Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius. To which Censure <hi>J. Lipsius</hi> makes these Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalls, <hi>Who can be displeased, to see</hi> Juvenal <hi>preferred before</hi> Horace <hi>by</hi> Scaliger <hi>the Father? that, in my opinion, among the many excellent judgements he hath given, never pronounced a greater truth: certainly he passed a just sentence for</hi> Juvenal; <hi>in heat, sublimity, and freedome</hi> (which are essential to a Satyr) <hi>he goes far beyond</hi> Horace: <hi>He searches Vice to the quick, reproves, cryes out upon it, now and then he makes us laugh, but very often mixes bitter jests:</hi> and writing to <hi>M. Muretus, Lipsius</hi> tells him; <hi>that in the publick reading of</hi> Juvenal, <hi>he did well seasonably; for if any Times ever needed a</hi> Satyr, <hi>ours do: and in</hi> Satyr, <hi>none so fit as</hi> Juvenal <hi>to rectifie the Manners of Men.</hi>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MY VERY GOOD LORD HENRY, Lord Marquesse of DORCHESTER, Earl of KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STON, Viscount NEWARK, Lord PIERREPONT and MAUNVERS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen your Lordship laid your commands upon me, to interpret JUVENAL, it was an honour I beheld with fear; for, though I knew him to be one of the greatest Classick Authors, yet I doubted, I should not find him the easiest: because I then <note place="margin">1638.</note> heard of no man that had attempted to put him into any other language: But O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to your Lordship, carried me through all the difficulties of my first Translation, and from the good successe of that (answerable to the event of all things acted according to your Lordship's judgement) I was incouraged to copy him a-new, out of his exactest Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:93027:9"/>
printed <note place="margin">1644.</note> afterwards at PARIS: to which I have added a large Comment, and the Designe of every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr in Picture. Thus restored to himself, and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I presume to bring JUVENAL once more to kisse your Lordship's hand: from which I received him, like an old ROMAN Coin, hard to be read, but worthy to be studied by our ablest Antiquaries.</p>
            <p>Truly, my LORD, if my abilities could have reached the height of my ambition, I would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, out of the learning of the GREEKS and RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANS (wherein your Lordship is so great a Master) not my interpretation of another; but some worke that should have owned me for the Author, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of such subjects as your Lordship daily reads: but since I cannot what I would, I acquiesce in what I can: it shall be happinesse enough for me, after the learned Authors of Sciences, and Commentators upon Lawes, have taken up your more reserved time, if my Author may entertain your houres of recreation: which I would not promise to my self, but that he DELIGHTS with PROFIT: For, your L<hi rend="sup">p</hi>^'<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> divertisements are more serious then most mens studies, your very mirth being observations upon Men and Businesse, which your Lordship knowes was the end that JUVENAL
<pb facs="tcp:93027:9"/>
aimed at: and undoubtedly MORES HOMINUM should at first have been the Title to his SATYRS, if his modesty could have prefixed, what I have done, out of his own words, QUICQUID AGUNT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MINES.</p>
            <p>But sooner may the Sun let fall his beames upon a solid body, without making a shadow, then Merit can exist without Detraction: No marvail, therefore, if Envy or Follie have stirred up Enemies against this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Satyrist, in severall Ages. In his time, his Country was exasperated by too great a CLEARNESSE of his stile, made (for the most part) by their own self-reflexions: for, guilty men are shrewdly apprehensive. Afterwards, to remoter parts, and strangers to the ROMANE Customes, he appeared OBSCURE, and was looked upon, like the Moon in an Eclipse, as drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the shadow of a forein clime. Lastly, though the greatest Scholars have made use of JUVENAL'S authority, as CUJACIUS in the civil Law; DE LA CERDA to explane TERTULLIAN; and GROTIUS to assert the Rights of Peace and War; yet, in our seed-plots of Learning, there sprung up a Sect of little formall Stoicks, that for a few wanton words (all they could make sense of) cast JUVENAL out of their
<pb facs="tcp:93027:10"/>
hands: just as if Pygmyes should throw away Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, set in Tablets bigger then themselves, only because their foils were black.</p>
            <p>My Copie will not (I hope) be liable to these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: The first falls to ground of it self, for, the bitterness of these Satyrs, being only PERSONAL to the ROMANS, cannot touch the ENGLISH: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have made it my businesse, to clear them from all OBSCURITY, which is the second charge. To perspicuity, I have added language so well-qualitied, that (I am confident) the third sort of accusers will never inform against this JUVENAL for Immodesty. And if when I took off his obscenity, I could have set on the full perfections of his Pen, my industry had been crowned to my wish.</p>
            <p>But though I am too much composed of earth, to ascend to my desires: I know your Lordship parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates so much of Heaven, as to descend to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of intentions. Yet when your name (now flying in the breath of every University) shall be the Protection of such learned Pieces as I cannot SHOW, but only can CONCEIVE: thus far my present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication will be happiest, as being first authorised by your Lordship, which I look upon as the earnest of
<pb facs="tcp:93027:10"/>
a generall approbation; for, the noble follow your opinion; all your example. But if there should be some one that dislikes my way, because I goe not his; such an Adversary I shall not think considerable, since the Judge (from whom no Scholar will appeal) gives sentence for</p>

Therefore, when the most perfect and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Impression came to my hands from <hi>Paris,</hi> I thought my self obliged to render it in <hi>English;</hi> as well in Gratitude to, as for the Benefit of, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. Yet I could not rest altogether satisfied, without making some (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:93027:12"/>
necessary) Additions of my own. In the first place, from the subject-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> I have given a <hi>Title</hi> to his Satyrs, viz. <hi>Mores Hominum, The Manners of Men,</hi> not without the warrant of a <hi>president</hi> from <hi>Horace,</hi> that calls his own Satyrs, <hi>Sermones.</hi> Withall, I have invented a <hi>Frontispice</hi> conteining in one Picture my Authors <hi>generall</hi> Designe, together with sixteen other <hi>Pieces,</hi> expressing the <hi>particular</hi> of every Satyr, whereunto I have writ <hi>Explanations</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> and also in <hi>Latin;</hi> that foreiners, if they please, may understand the <hi>Cuts,</hi> and our Country-men make use of their interpretation, as my former Arguments inlarged. Lastly, that nothing within my power might be wanting, I have taken care, in a new <hi>Comment,</hi> to set down clearly, though briefly, every <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Custome, Law, and History; for all which <hi>I</hi> quote my Authors: yet I am not ignorant, that our new Mode of writing will no more allow of quotations in the body of a Work, then in the beginning of a Preface; but I shall desire to be excused in both; for I humbly conceive, that reason is never out of fashion: and in matter of weight or controversie, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not justly hope for credit, that shews not authority, and he that doth it well, makes a Book a Library. By the way, I must give you this caution, that you will find the Historie of the <hi>Ante-Trojan</hi> Times more pleasant then true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrapt up by the <hi>Greeks</hi> in Allegories, in whose respective Mythologie, I have endeavoured to unfold the mysterious Wisdome of the Ancients. How this will be taken, I know not; but <hi>I</hi> am sure, 'tis not conclusive, from a former favour to infer the necessity of a second: Howsoever, I am no <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> dare trust my Country with my Life, much more with my Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> shall conclude with a Request to my Reader, that he will not charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me the literall or other coincident errours of the Printer, which for the most part (if not totally) are corrected in the Table.</p>

In pursuance of this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he committed her to a Master of a Ship, commanding him to set her ashoar in some far distant Country, where her dishonour could not have arrived: but his private instructions were, that when he had her at Sea, he should drown her. Before she came aboard him, in a Forest of <hi>Mysia,</hi> she fell in labour, and was delivered of a Boy, that by the Midwife was conveyed away, and hid among the bushes. Fortune having thus rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Child, Beauty pleaded in behalf of the Mother; and so far the Master's cruel heart was melted, that he landed her in <hi>Caria,</hi> and there sold her to <hi>Theutrantes,</hi> who in a short time raised her from his Slave to be his Queen. Mean time some <hi>Mysian</hi> Shepheards, driving their flocks through the Forest, saw a Hind (singled from the Heard) that never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to stir till they came up to her, where they found her giving suck to a new-born Babe, which they took up and carried home to one of their Wives. The news of the Child's strange preservation flying through the Kingdome of <hi>Mysia,</hi> came to the King's ear, who sent for the Infant, and was so taken with his beauty, that he eased the Shepheards of their care, and bred him up as his own. In short, the King being Childless, upon his death-bed, adopted this Child of fortune, to whom he then gave his Crown, as he had formerly given him the name of <hi>Telephus</hi> in memory

               <p>A hard task it would be for the best Rhetorician living, to perswade <hi>Sylla,</hi> if he were now alive (for that was the case) to resigne the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power, unless he were such an Orator as could bring arguments to raise the love of Pleasure above that of Ambition and Revenge: to all which <hi>Sylla</hi> was passionately given, as you will finde in this Summary of his life. <hi>Sylla</hi> or <hi>Sulla</hi> was nobly born; but till the time of his Questorship, he much dishonored the <hi>Patrician</hi> Family, from which he was descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, with drinking, wenching, and acting in private among Stage-play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, his wit making him an excellent Comedian; for it was quick and sharp, as you may note from his animadversion upon the letter writ him by <hi>Caphis</hi> the <hi>Phocian,</hi> advising him not to meddle with the sacred trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>Delphos,</hi> because he was told for certain that the God was heard to strike his Lute in the Sanctuary. To this <hi>Sylla</hi> answered, That he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93027:24"/>
wondered <hi>Caphis</hi> understood the god no better; for one that is really sad will have no minde to play Tunes: and therefore <hi>Caphis</hi> should not fear to receive that which <hi>Apollo</hi> parted with so merrily. But <hi>Sylla</hi> was not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier in his jests, then he was in serious concerns; wherein he had been without a Parallel, if his Cruelty had not blemish'd his Fortune. He fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered King <hi>Jugurth,</hi> defeated <hi>Marius,</hi> destroyed the Government of <hi>Cinna,</hi> proscribed <hi>Sulpitius</hi>; and commanded that <hi>Sulpitius</hi> his Slave, for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Master, should have his neck broken from the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> rock. He beat <hi>Mithrydates</hi> out of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Euboea,</hi> confining him within the limits of his hereditary Kingdome of <hi>Pontus.</hi> At the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> neer to the <hi>Collin</hi> Gate, he fought a battel, where the number of the slain was said to be 80000. Then he entred the City, where he gave quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to 4000 men; and when they had delivered up their weapons, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to be put to the sword, he himself (as <hi>Seneca</hi> reports) then sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Senate within the Temple of <hi>Bellona</hi>; where the Lords being frighted with the shrieks of the dying men, he cryed, To the business of the day, these (my Lords) are a few seditious Rogues slain by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. He likewise put to death of his own party above 9000. In his first Roll of Proscription he writ down 80000 names: in his second List 5000. By his order <hi>M. Marius,</hi> Brother to <hi>C. Marius,</hi> had his eyes dig'd out, and was then cut to pieces limb by limb: He also slew <hi>Carinates</hi> Praetor to <hi>Marius.</hi> In short, he made not only <hi>Rome,</hi> but all <hi>Italy,</hi> a Slaughter-house. He did ill valiantly: and was cautious enough to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himself He knew no fear of Heaven; had no Faith; no Mercy. Four <hi>Marian</hi> Legions confiding in his false promise, and imploring the pitty that never dwelt in him, were slain to a man. Five thousand <hi>Praenestines,</hi> that had his word for their indemnity, he caused to be slain
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93027:24"/>
and cast into the fields, denying burial to their bodies. He drew his sword against women. He commanded mens heads to be brought him only to make sport withall. The ashes of <hi>Marius</hi> were dis-urned by his barbarity. From the time that he resigned the Dictator-ship, until the very hour of his death, he recreated himself with Players, Fools and Fidlers. The day before his death, hearing that <hi>Granius</hi> the Praetor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the payment of his vast debts in expectation of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s death, he sent for the Praetor to his Chamber, and there, after he had Rogu'd and Rascal'd him, commanded him to be strangled: But the fury wherewith he ranted, put his body into so violent an agitation, that his Impost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume (the bed of his lowsie disease) broke; and all that night strugling for life in his own blood, next morning he gave up the Ghost.

               <p>Verse 60. <hi>Marius.] Marius Priscus</hi> Proconsul of <hi>Africa,</hi> accused and prosecuted by the <hi>Africans</hi> for poling of their Country, was banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned by <hi>Cornutus</hi> in the summe of 7000 <hi>nummi</hi> or <hi>sestertii:</hi> but this small summe (not ten pound more then <hi>Crispinus</hi> paid for his Mullet) was paid in to the Exchequer: the Province lost the charges of the Suit wherein they overthrew him; and the vast remainder of the money which he had extorted from them, enabled him in his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to live more riotously then he had done in <hi>Rome</hi>; for there

he eat at their ninth hour, which is our three of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; but in his exile he drank from their eighth hour, which is our two of the clock in the afternoon, being the time when the <hi>Romans</hi> bathed to prepare their bodies for dinner; and so <hi>Marius</hi> by his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment clearly got an hour of earlier riot. And though his own Country Gods were offended, it seems the forrein Gods were better pleased.</p>
               <p>Verse 64. <hi>Hercules.</hi>] Son to <hi>Jupiter</hi> by <hi>Alcmena.</hi> The twelve La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors imposed upon him by <hi>Juno,</hi> was a subject much handled by the Romançe Poets. <hi>Panyasis</hi> writ the <hi>Heraculea,</hi> fourteen books of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi>

               <p>Verse 66. <hi>Labyrinth.</hi>] Thus runs the Fable of the Labyrinth. <hi>Pasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phae,</hi> Wife to <hi>Minos</hi> King of the <hi>Cretans,</hi> was taken with a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and nefarious love to a Bull; and by the art of <hi>Daedalus,</hi> she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in a Cow of wood; so attaining her desire, she conceived and brought forth the Minotaur, half Man half Bull. The Instruments of her wickedness being discovered by <hi>Minos,</hi> he shut up <hi>Daedalus</hi> with his Son <hi>Icarus</hi> in that very Labyrinth made by his Master Builder <hi>Daedalus:</hi> But he got out with another invention of Wings, and flew to <hi>Cumae</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where he laid them down. <hi>Sat.</hi> 3.

But, it seems, that which flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered him to this expence, was a hope that <hi>Caesar</hi> would make him Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or Captain of his Praetorian Guards.</p>
               <p>Verse 76. <hi>Automedon</hi>] was Coachman to <hi>Achilles.</hi> It appears that <hi>Fuscus,</hi> besides his expectation to be Captain of the Guard, had a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination to be a Chariotier; for, when he was the Boy <hi>Autome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that is, before he was able to drive the horses like a man, he used to sit with the Chariot-driver, and to hold the rains, to show his affection to that Art, and withall to commend himself to his young Mistresses that were so much taken with Chariotiers.</p>
               <p>Verse 80. <hi>Forger of a Will.</hi>] The Author means <hi>Tigellinus,</hi> that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned three of his Uncles (as you may read towards the end of this

               <p>Verse 83. <hi>Maecenas.</hi>] That great Patron of the Poets <hi>Maecenas,</hi> was known to be likewise so great a Voluptuary, that <hi>Juvenal</hi> never useth his name but in this sense, as here, and <hi>Sat.</hi> 12.</p>

               <p>Verse 99. <hi>Since</hi> Deucalion] That is since the World began again after <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Flood; when he landing upon the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Parnassus,</hi> consulted the Oracle of <hi>Themis</hi> about the restoration of Mankinde, and was answered, It might be done by him and his Wife <hi>Pyrrha,</hi> if they would cast stones over their shoulders, which should be mollified into flesh and blood, and inanimated with a rational Soul; and (if we believe the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians or Fabulists) they did so, and it succeeded accordingly; to which <hi>Juvenal</hi> adds, that <hi>Pyrrha</hi> put the Males and Females together.</p>
               <p>Verse 113. <hi>Villa's.</hi>] Country-houses.</p>
               <p>Verse 115. <hi>The Sportula.</hi>] When the <hi>Romans</hi> were grown so proud in their Luxury, that a great man scorned to admit his Friends to his Table; instead of a Supper they were entertained by a Porter at the Gate,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93027:28"/>

Rom. c.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Verse. 121. <hi>The Tribune.</hi>] The Tribunes of the People, from the number of two in their first Institution, came afterward to be ten. These were Protectors of the Commonalty; they sate at the dore of the Senate; they were the Grand-jury to inform the Lords: No Act could pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they subscribed it with the letter T. but they themselves had not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make an Act at first; yet in processe of time they usurped such a power. <hi>Pomp.

               <p>Verse. 122. <hi>The Freed-man.</hi>] Was an Infranchised Slave; and this might be <hi>Crispinus</hi> by his taking place of the Praetor and Tribune, or it might be any other Infranchised Slave, that was a Native of <hi>Capadocia, Mesapotamia, Assyria,</hi> or <hi>Arabia</hi>; for the river <hi>Euphrates</hi> runs through all these Countries.</p>
               <p>Verse 127. <hi>A</hi> Roman <hi>Knight.</hi>] The <hi>Census Equestris,</hi> or that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state which made the <hi>Eques Romanus,</hi> (a dignity answering that of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93027:29"/>
Knight with us) was 400 sestertia, about 3125 l. of our money. A Freed-man worth so much might claim the Priviledges of a Knight, and a Knight that had less could not sit upon the Benches and Cushions at a Play by <hi>Otho</hi>'s Law. <hi>Sat.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Vers. 128. <hi>Corvinus.</hi>] One of the noble Family of the <hi>Corvini,</hi> but grown so wretchedly poor, that he was inforced to serve a Shepheard, and keep his Flocks near to the Town of <hi>Laurentum</hi> in his own native Country.</p>
               <p>Verse 130. <hi>Pallas.</hi>] He was the wealthy Freed-man of <hi>Claudius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> that suffered him, together with <hi>Narcissus</hi> his fellow Freed-man, to have, not only great Estates conferred by Decree of Senate upon them, but likewise the Dignities of Quaestor and Praetor; and let them extort and monopolize so much, that when he complained of the emptiness of his Exchequer, one answered, It would be full enough if his two Freed-men might refund.

App. lib.</hi> 1. and therefore when the old Stork returned to feed her young ones, they would be sure to salute her with a creaking noise. If it were not for the word creaking, I should have inclined to <hi>Politian</hi>'s opinion, that in his <hi>Miscel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies</hi> interprets this to be a nest of Quails, the Embleme of Concord.</p>

The Patron was obliged in honour to protect his Client; the Client, besides his attendance in publick, was bound by Law to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards his Patrons assesments and Daughters marriages. If any Client could be proved unfaithfull to his Patron, to have informed, made oath, or given his vote against him, or for his Enemy, he was for such disloyalty devoted to the Infernall Gods, and not only accursed by the Priest, but out-lawed by the Criminal Judge; so that it was lawfull for any man to kill him. <hi>Lazius de Repub. Rom. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Verse 153. <hi>The Forum.</hi>] The great Roman Piazza, where the Courts of Justice sate, to which the Client, after he had complemented his Friends at the Sportula, waited upon his Patron. <hi>Martial</hi>

                  <hi>Arabian</hi> Prince. Some take <hi>Arabarch</hi> for a Customer in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived toll for Cattle brought thither out of <hi>Arabia</hi>; but <hi>Juvenal</hi> seems to use the Word for an Arch-rogue.</p>
               <p>Verse 161. <hi>A Supper.</hi>] The Supper which the Patron was ordered by <hi>Domitian Caesar</hi> to bestow upon his Clients, was called <hi>Caena recta,</hi> a plain Supper, to distinguish it from the Patrons <hi>Caena dubia,</hi> or Supper of varieties, such as puzled the Guests to know where they should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.

               <p>Verse 177. <hi>Angry Friends.</hi>] Neer relations must needs be vext at the death of a Friend, by gluttony so surprized, as not to have time to make a Will. Yet even they could not but laugh at such a Comicall disaster, though they lost their Legacies by it.</p>
               <p>Verse 186. <hi>Mutius.</hi>] A great Knave but a poor man; so that when the <hi>Auruncane</hi> Satyrist, <hi>Lucilius,</hi> published his knavery, he had not a purse to see Advocates in a cause of Defamation: but if <hi>Tigellinus,</hi> the Emperor's Favourite, had been the man so defamed, he would have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Law, which was, <hi>Ne licet carmen fieri ad alterius injuriam.</hi> Cicer. lib. 4.

Yet that very Judge might in his conscience know that <hi>Tigellinus</hi> was a thousand times the greater Villain. <hi>M.

Note that <hi>Juvenal,</hi> speaking here of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Martyrdomes, writes nothing disparageable to the Religion it self, as he doth to that of the Jewes in <hi>Sat.</hi> 3. and 14. from whence it may with reason be inferred, that because he scofs not at Christianity, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced it.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erse 1. <hi>Beyond</hi> Sarmatia, <hi>and the Frozen Sea I could fly hence—]Juvenal</hi> was so moved at the impudence of pretenders to Philosophy, base Hypocrites, that took upon them to reform the manners of the <hi>Romans</hi>; That, rather then stay in <hi>Rome</hi> with such Knaves, he could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented (if wings were to be got) to fly beyond <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> that is, to trust himself with the most barbarous <hi>Russians, Laplanders, Finlanders,</hi> and inhumane <hi>Cannibals</hi>; and so passing the River <hi>Tanais</hi> (that divides the two <hi>Sarmatia's,</hi> parting the <hi>European Tartars</hi> from the <hi>Asiatick</hi>) to fly over the Frozen Sea, which was then believed to be innavigable; but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have lately sailed so far in the North-east passage, that they have discovered <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> within the Artick Circle, but twelve degrees from the Pole.</p>
               <p>Verse 3. <hi>Curian Temperance.</hi>] The <hi>Curian</hi> Family was enobled by the Temperance and Valour of <hi>Marcus Curius,</hi> that triumphed over the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, Samnites,</hi> and <hi>Leucanians,</hi> and beat King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> out of <hi>Italy</hi>;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93027:40"/>
but his greatest triumph was over himself and his affections, as appears by his answer to the <hi>Samnite</hi> Ambassadors, that finding his Table cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the fire-side, furnished only with earthen dishes, and <hi>Curius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self roasting of roots for his supper, beseeched him to better his poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by accepting a great sum of money from their hands; to which he answered, that <hi>he had rather still eat in earth, and command the</hi> Samnites <hi>that were served in gold.</hi> Being accused for plundering, he produced a wooden vessell, which upon proof appeared to be all he had of the spoil. <hi>Liv.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 4. <hi>Bacchanals.</hi>] The Celebraters of the <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> or <hi>Dionysia,</hi> the libidinous Feasts of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> where virtue was death; for they that refused to sacrifice to Lust, were sacrificed by the fury of the Bacchanals. Of the abominable Ceremonies used at these Feasts, see <hi>Liv. &amp; St. Augustine.</hi> They were at last as a Seminary of wickedness interdicted by the Senate.</p>
               <p>Verse 5. <hi>Chrysippus.</hi>] The Philosopher <hi>Chrysippus,</hi> the most ingenious Scholar to <hi>Zeno</hi> the first Stoick, and to his Successor <hi>Cleanthes</hi>; from both which Masters he only desired to know Doctrines, and bid them leave the Proofs to him; indeed he was so incomparable a Logician, that it grew to a Proverb, <hi>If the Gods would study Logick, they would read</hi> Chrysippus. He was Son to <hi>Apollonides</hi> (by some called <hi>Apollonius</hi>) of <hi>Tarsis,</hi> but he was born at <hi>Soli</hi> a City of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> Having spent what his father left him in following a Kings Court, he was compelled to study Philosophy, as being capable of no other course that might buoy up his fortunes: but after he was an eminent Philosopher, he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated any of his books, as others did theirs, to Kings; and therefore was thought to be a great despiser of Honours, <hi>Laertius.</hi> But it is more
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93027:40"/>
probable, that he following his studies to inrich himself, would neglect no good Medium to a fortune; and I rather believe, that he having smarted so much by attendance at Court, would never apply himself to Princes any more. He died of a violent laughter, with seeing an Asse eat figs, as some say, but of a Vertigo, according to <hi>Hermippus,</hi> in the 143 Olympiad, having lived seventy three years.</p>
               <p>Verse. 7. <hi>Aristotle</hi>] Was born at <hi>Stagyra,</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace,</hi> seated upon the river <hi>Strymon</hi>; his Father was <hi>Nicomachus</hi> the Physician, the Son of <hi>Macaon,</hi> famed by <hi>Homer</hi> for his skill in Physick, which it seems came to him <hi>extraduce,</hi> for <hi>Micaon</hi> was the Son of <hi>Aesculapius. Phaestias,</hi> Mother to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> was descended likewise from <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> as some affirm; but others say, she was Daughter to one of the Planters sent from <hi>Chalcis</hi> to <hi>Stagyra.</hi> He was a slender man, crump-shouldered, and stuttered naturally very much: but, for his incomparable erudition, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> sought to him to be his Son <hi>Alexander's</hi> Tutor; and <hi>Alexander</hi> made him his Secretary. He was 18 years old when he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there for 20 years he heard <hi>Plato.</hi> The City of <hi>Stagyra,</hi> from its ruines, was for his sake reedified by his Pupill, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. When <hi>Alexander</hi> marched into <hi>Asia, Aristotle</hi> returned to <hi>Athens,</hi> and read Philosophy in the <hi>Lyceum</hi> thirteen years, from whence his Scholars were properly called <hi>Peripateticks</hi> of the <hi>Lyceum,</hi> (to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> of the <hi>Academy,</hi> the <hi>Platonists,</hi>) yet afterwards they were known by the name of <hi>Peripateticks</hi> only, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he himself is deservedly styled the Prince. After all the benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him by <hi>Athens,</hi> the return made, was an impeachment drawn up against him, that he was no true worshiper of the Gods. But this (as you shall presently see) had formerly been the case of <hi>Socrates,</hi> by the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93027:41"/>
sad example of whose death, <hi>Aristotle</hi> learned to decline the envy and fury of that unthankfull City; from whence he went to <hi>Chalcis</hi> in <hi>Eubaea,</hi> and there died in the sixtie third year of his age, and the 114 Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, when <hi>Philocles</hi> was Archon: the very same year <hi>Demosthenes</hi> also died in <hi>Calauria,</hi> both being forced to fly their Countries. <hi>Aristotle</hi> was the first that made a Library, <hi>Strabo lib.</hi> 3. which together with his School, he left to <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> that taught the Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> how to order their Library, by disposing of their Books into severall Classes.</p>
               <p>Verse 8. <hi>Pittacus.] Pittacus,</hi> one of the seven Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> assisted by the Bretheren of <hi>Alcaeus</hi> the Poet, slew <hi>Melancrus</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> in the chief City whereof, <hi>viz. Mytelene, Pittacus</hi> was born. A war breaking out between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Mytelenians</hi> about the <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leian</hi> fields, he was chosen General for his Country, and finding his Army too weak to dispute that Title in the field, he challenged <hi>Phryno,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to a single combat, and met him like a Fisher-man, his visible armes being a Trident, Dagger, and Shield; but under it was a Net, which, in the Duel, he cast over the head of <hi>Phryno,</hi> and so conquered him by stratagem that had been Victor by his Giantly strength in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games. <hi>Strabo. Laert.</hi> This Duel <hi>Lyps.</hi> saith, was the original of those kind of prizes played by the <hi>Roman</hi> Gladiators, called the <hi>Retiarius,</hi> and <hi>Secutor,</hi> or <hi>Mirmillo,</hi> described in this Satyr, to the shame of so noble a person as one of the <hi>Gracchi</hi> was, that for a poor salary was hired by the Praetor to venture his life as a Retiarius or Net-bearer, against the Secutor's Fauchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. You may see their figures (as they acted in the Circus) in the Designe before this Satyr. So long as his Country needed him to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93027:41"/>
manage the warres, so long <hi>Pittacus</hi> held the Sovereign power as an absolute Prince. But when the warre was ended, he like an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Philosopher, put an end to his own authority; and after a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary resignation of his power continued for ten years, he lived ten years more a private person, <hi>Laert. Val Max.</hi> being about fourscore, he dyed in the third year of the 52 Olympiad, <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> being Archon.</p>
               <p>Verse 9. <hi>Cleanthes.] Cleanthes</hi> the Stoick was Scholar to <hi>Crates,</hi> and Successor to <hi>Zeno</hi> Founder of the Stoicks; his Father was <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of <hi>Assus</hi>; by his first profession he was a VVrastler, but it brought him in no great revenue; for all he had was but four Drachma's when he came to hear <hi>Crates</hi>: and to get a lively-hood under him and <hi>Zeno,</hi> he was forced to work by night, to keep himself from hunger and scorn in the day time. The Court of <hi>Areopagus</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to clear the suspicion of Fellony, and give an account how he lived, he produced a Woman, for whom he ground meal; and a Gardiner that payed him for drawing of water; and shewed <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s Dictates writ in shells and Oxes shoulder-blades, for want of money to buy Paper. He succeeded <hi>Zeno</hi> in his Schoole, lived above fourscore years, and died voluntarily; for his Physicians injoyning him to fast two dayes; for the cure of an ulcer under his tongue; when they would have had him eat again, he would not, but took it unkindly that they would offer to bring him back, being two dayes onward on his journey; so continuing his fast for other two dayes, he came to his last home.</p>
               <p>Verse. 14. <hi>Socratick Catomite.] Socrates</hi> was son to the Statuary <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroniscus,</hi> and the Midwife <hi>Phaenareta,</hi> and husband first to <hi>Myrto</hi> the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93027:42"/>
Daughter of <hi>Aristides</hi> the Just, afterwards to <hi>Zantippe,</hi> the arrantest Scold that ever thundered with a tongue. He first reduced Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy from naturall to morall (that is) from contemplation to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, it being his constant Maxime, <hi>Quae supra nos nihil ad nos, We are not at all concerned in things above us. Anytus</hi> the Orator, indeed the leather-Dresser, for that Trade inriched him; though he was asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to own it, and therefore having been upon that score (reproached by <hi>Socrates</hi>) to satisfie his spleen, he got <hi>Melitus</hi> the Poet and <hi>Lycon</hi> his fellow Orator, to joyn in drawing up an Impeachment against <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> as no true worshiper of the Gods, and a corrupter of youth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first made him a scorn to the people, by hiring <hi>Aristophanes</hi> to bring him upon the Stage in a Comedy. From the abuse put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in this Comedy, others, many ages after, took occasion to abuse <hi>Socrates</hi>; especially <hi>Porphyrius</hi> observed by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> to be more malicious then were his Accusers, <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melitus.</hi> But I doe not believe that my Author intended to cast dirt upon him in this place; where <hi>Socratick Catamite</hi> cannot be otherwise interpreted, then one of those censorious persons, that would be thought as learned and virtuous as <hi>Socrates,</hi> when they really were as vitious as men could be, and as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned as the very Statues of the Philosophers, the purchase whereof was all the proof they could make of their learning. Some there are that imitate their folly in our dayes, as appears by the instance <hi>Lubine</hi> makes in a Scholar, his Contemporary, whom he forbears to name, that gave 3000 drachma's for the earthen-lamp, that <hi>Epictetus</hi> used, hoping, that if it burned all night by his bed-side, it would infuse into him the wisdome of <hi>Epictetus</hi> in a dream. If he bought the lamp for this reason (as <hi>Lubine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives he did) then he was guilty of the vanity of <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Philosophasters
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93027:42"/>
but if he bestowed so much money upon a piece of Antiquity, that might be usefull to the present and succeeding times; in that case I should honour him for his expence, as I doe the memory of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> (Grandchilde and Heir to the last Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi>) for the vast summes those Statues cost him, from which Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> hath pickt out so many learned notions; as you may find in his book entituled <hi>Marmora Arundeliana:</hi> among which Statues is the inscription that proves <hi>Laches</hi> to be <hi>Archon</hi> at the death of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which is to be made use of in this very place. As for <hi>Epictetus</hi> his lamp, it might have been of great advantage to <hi>Fortunius Licetas,</hi> when he writ <hi>De Lucernis absconditis.</hi> To return to our account of <hi>Socrates,</hi> He was convicted of impiety and improbity by the false oaths of his Accusers, and the testiness of his Judges, for being asked at the Bar, What in his own judgement he deserved, he answered, To be maintained by you the great Councell or Prytanaeum, at the publique charge; which so enraged the Senate, that the major part, by above 80. voted him to death, and accordingly execution was done, the Officer of death presenting him a draught of Hemlock, which he cheerfully took off; and so <hi>Laches,</hi> as aforesaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Archon,</hi> in the first year of the ninety fift Olympiad, he was poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that ingratefull City of <hi>Athens,</hi> which as <hi>Juvenal</hi> sayes <hi>Sat</hi> 7.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Verse 21. <hi>Peribonius.</hi>] The Archi-gallus or chief Priest of <hi>Cybele,</hi> Principall of an Order of Rogues so infamous for drunkennesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, that it was not lawfull for a free-born <hi>Roman</hi> to be one of the number. The original of their institution was this, <hi>Cybele</hi> the daughter of King <hi>Minos,</hi> being in her infancy exposed upon the Hill <hi>Cybelus</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:93027:43"/>
                  <hi>Phrygia,</hi> from which Hill she had her name, and there nourished by the wilde beasts, to whose mercy she was left, was found by a Shepherds wife, bred up as her own Child, and grew to be both a great Beauty, and a Lady of most excellent naturall parts; for the <hi>Greeks</hi> from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention had the Taber, Pipe, and Cimballs. She was married to <hi>Saturne,</hi> and therefore Mother of the Gods, her highest title. She was also called <hi>Rhea,</hi> from her flowing or aboundant goodnesse: styled likewise <hi>Pessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntia,</hi> from <hi>Pessinus</hi> a Mart-town in <hi>Phrygia</hi>; and <hi>Berecynthia,</hi> from <hi>Berecynthus</hi> a Mountain in the same Countrey, where her Ceremonies were begun; and <hi>Atis,</hi> a handsome young <hi>Phrygian,</hi> by her appointed su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent over them, upon condition that he would promise chastity during life: but not long after he defloured a Nymph: for which offence <hi>Cybele</hi> took away his understanding; and in one of his mad fits, by his own hand he was gelt, and after that, he attempted to kill himself; but it seems the Compassionate Gods prevented him, and turned the youth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Pine-tree, <hi>Ovid. Met.</hi> By his example, the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Priests ever after gelded themselves with the shell of a fish. Their Vest was particoloured, called <hi>Synthesis,</hi> or <hi>amictus variegatus</hi>; they carried the picture of their Goddesse through the streets of <hi>Rome</hi> in their hands, and striking their breasts, kept tune with their Tabers Pipes, and Cymbals, called <hi>Aera Corybantia</hi>: as they were named <hi>Corybantes,</hi> from <hi>Corybantus,</hi> one of <hi>Cybele</hi>'s first Votaries, they wore Miters fastened under their chins, <hi>Sat.</hi> 6.

These twelve Ancilia were delivered into the custody of twelve Priests of <hi>Mars,</hi> which number was afterwards increased to four and twenty, (one of whose Colledge this <hi>Gracchus</hi> was, before he married the Trumpeter) called Salian or dancing Priests, because, as you have heard, their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome was to dance when they carried the Ancilia. This stupendious marriage of a Priest of <hi>Mars</hi> makes my Author cry out upon the God, that revenged not upon his Priest this prophanation of his Deity; and that being the Father of <hi>Romulus,</hi> and therefore of the <hi>Romans,</hi> his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headship looked no better to his children, but suffered them to act these abominations even in the <hi>Campus Martius, the Fields of Mars,</hi> and in the <hi>Quirine</hi> Valley, which was likewise consecrated to him, that was in his fury called by the <hi>Romans Gradivus,</hi> but when he was amicable <hi>Quirinus, Ovid.</hi> 2. <hi>Fast.</hi>

about <hi>Rome</hi> to sell receipts to Ladies.

               <p>Verse 172. <hi>Active Luperci.</hi>] The <hi>Lupercalia</hi> were Feasts and Games solemnized by the <hi>Romans</hi> in honour of God <hi>Pan,</hi> whom they called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uus</hi> or <hi>Junus, Pomponius Laetus de Sacerd. cap. de Luper.</hi> The time of their celebration was upon the unfortunate dayes of <hi>February, a Februando,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of Purification; though the Feast it self was called <hi>Lupercale,</hi> the Feast of Wolves, in memory of the Wolf that nursed <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi>: and the <hi>Luperci,</hi> the Priests that ran the Course, set forth at the foot of Mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> where the Wolf gave suck to <hi>Romulus</hi>; likewise a Dog the VVolfs enemy was then sacrificed with two Goats. These were the Ceremonies, <hi>Plut.</hi> in <hi>Romul.</hi> after the Sacrifice, two young Lords wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Altar, had their foreheads bloodied with the Popa's knife where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he killed the Goats: the blood was presently dried up with wool dipt in milk; and as soon as ever their foreheads were drie, it was their <hi>Qu</hi> to laugh: then the Goats skins being cut into thongs, the youths took them in their hands, and only girting a napkin about their middles, ran stark naked through the streets, striking all they met with the thongs,

and the wives that never had children, would be sure to stand in their way, because they believed there was a virtue in those touches that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped conception. The reason why they ran naked, was, because the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds God, <hi>Pan Licaeus,</hi> in whose honour the <hi>Arcadians</hi> first instituted such Games, was ever painted naked, <hi>Fenest. de Sacerd. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Verse 173. <hi>Fencer</hi> Gracchus] <hi>Juvenal</hi> seems not to be so much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Gracchus</hi> the <hi>Salian</hi> Priest, as with <hi>Gracchus</hi> the Gladiator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this dishonoured his illustrious Family in the sight of all <hi>Rome</hi>; fighting upon the Stage as a <hi>Retiarius,</hi> or <hi>Jack-Pudding</hi> to the Clown the <hi>Myrmillo.</hi> The manner of their fight was this; the <hi>Retiarius</hi> and <hi>Myrmillo</hi> or <hi>Secutor</hi> being so armed as you see in the Designe before this Satyr, and the whole City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well the Senate as the People look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; the <hi>Retiarius</hi> tried all the wayes of his Art, to get the <hi>Myrmillo</hi>'s head into his <hi>Cast-net,</hi> sometimes seeming not to minde himself, that the <hi>Secutor</hi> might think he lay open to his <hi>Sica</hi> or crooked sword, and whilest he cunningly gave him a blow at his leg or thigh, attempting with his Float-net to halter him: but if he missed, he was forced to fly round about the Lists till he could recover, and put himself into a posture of offence: in the mean time he kept off the <hi>Sica</hi> with his <hi>Fuscina</hi> or <hi>Trident</hi>: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they would come to a <hi>Parlee,</hi> and the Net-bearer would act the <hi>Complementaster,</hi> telling the <hi>Follower,</hi> though he knew his blood was sought by him, and alwayes carried a spunge in his pocket, <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 31. to wipe away his fury, yet for his own part he meant no harm to the Follower himself, only he desired to catch his Fish. <hi>See</hi> Lipsius <hi>in</hi> Saturnal. <hi>&amp;</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal, <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. where he describes this <hi>Gracchus</hi> in the <hi>Lists,</hi> not compelled by <hi>Nero</hi> to fight as a Gladiator: but voluntarily, after he had spent his fortunes, selling his honor, life and funerall to the Praetor, being a man of

               <p>Verse 176. <hi>Capitoline Race.] Capitoline</hi> was the Cognomen or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of the <hi>Manlian</hi> Family, whose Founder <hi>Marcus Manlius,</hi> for affecting the Sovereign power, was adjudged to be cast down from the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> or <hi>Capitoline</hi> Rock.</p>
               <p>Verse 177. <hi>Marcellus</hi>] was the proper name of the gallant <hi>Roman</hi> that in a single combat killed the Generall of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> took <hi>Syracusa</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> was five times Consul, and at last, circumvented by <hi>Hannibal</hi> in an ambush, perished.</p>

               <p>Verse 177. Fabian <hi>name.</hi>] The <hi>Fabii</hi> were those noble and potent <hi>Romans</hi> that took upon themselves the war against the <hi>Vientes,</hi> only drawing with them into the field their Clients and Slaves; and having worsted the Enemy in many light skirmishes, at last by a stratagem at the River <hi>Cremera</hi> they were all slain to a man, <hi>Ovid lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Fast.</hi> yet this sad calamity one of the <hi>Fabian</hi> Family survived, being left at <hi>Rome</hi> a Child, from whom by a long series of descents came that <hi>Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus,</hi> created <hi>Dictator</hi> against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose dilatory prudence

               <p>Verse 184. <hi>Pay not for their bath.</hi>] No children at <hi>Rome</hi> were exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from paying the Balneatick, or Bath-farthing, but only such Infants as were carried in their Nurses armes; and it should seem that only such believed their Nurses, that told them of Hell and Hobgoblins.</p>
               <p>Verse 185. <hi>Camillus</hi>] Was called a second <hi>Romulus,</hi> as a new Founder of <hi>Rome</hi> after the <hi>Gauls</hi> were Masters of it: ten years he held the <hi>Veians</hi> besieged, and then took the Town by a Mine: Soon after he was brought to his Trial by <hi>Apuleius Saturninus</hi> Tribune of the people, for riding in Triumph with white horses, and for an unequal distribution of the spoil: being condemned he withdrew into <hi>Ardea:</hi> but when the <hi>Gauls</hi> had possessed themselves of <hi>Rome,</hi> and straightly besieged the Capitol, he was in his absence chosen Dictator, and collecting the scattered <hi>Romans,</hi> surprized the <hi>Gauls</hi> that only busied their heads about weighing of <hi>Roman</hi> gold; and so restored his Country to their Liberty. After this, when the people of <hi>Rome</hi> would needs transplant themselves to <hi>Veii,</hi> he stayed them with a grave and eloquent Oration, which you may read in <hi>Livy,</hi> wherein you may see all the perfections and excellencies of the

City of <hi>Rome.</hi> The third time that he was made Dictator, he preserved the City <hi>Satricum,</hi> confederate with the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the fury of the <hi>Latins.</hi> The fourth time that he was chosen Dictator to pacifie a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the people, he excused himself for want of health, and deputed another in his place. The fifth time that he was Dictator, the <hi>Gauls</hi> once again marching towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and quartering their Army neer the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Aviene,</hi> were utterly defeated by him.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erse 2. <hi>Cumae,</hi>] A City in <hi>Campania,</hi> upon the Sea-coast neer to <hi>Puteoli,</hi> built by the <hi>Cumaeans,</hi> a people of <hi>Asia,</hi> whose Generall <hi>Hippocles</hi> joyning with <hi>Megasthenes</hi> Generall for the <hi>Chalcidians,</hi> the Articles between them were so drawn, that <hi>Hippocles</hi> was to have the naming of the City, and <hi>Megasthenes</hi> the right of colony or plantation, <hi>Strabo lib.</hi> 5. Thus the <hi>Cumaeans</hi> of <hi>Aeolia</hi> gave the name to that Town, from which the Sibyll called <hi>Cumaea</hi> received hers.</p>
               <p>Verse 4. <hi>Baiae,</hi>] Another City of <hi>Campania,</hi> so named from <hi>Baius</hi> one of <hi>Vlysses</hi> his Mates there buried. Neer to this City were the Baths, or that confluence of warm Springs whereunto the noblest <hi>Romans</hi> resorted both for pleasure and health, which made it flourish with many fair and Princely Buildings, <hi>Martial</hi> to <hi>Valerius Flaccus.</hi>

of <hi>Enarime,</hi> which by an Earthquake was from thence <hi>poured out,</hi> and therefore by the <hi>Graecians</hi> called <hi>Prochyta.</hi> But <hi>Dionys Halicar, lib.</hi> 1. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the name to be derived from <hi>Prochyta</hi> Nurse to <hi>Aeneas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 6. <hi>Suburra,</hi>] One of the fairest and most frequented Streets in <hi>Rome. Festus</hi> from the authority of <hi>Verrius</hi> saith it had the name <hi>a fuccur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo,</hi> for as much as the Courts of Guard were there which relieved the Watch, when the <hi>Gabines</hi> besieged that part of the Town; and to shew that the change of the letters came only by the vulgar errour of pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, he tells us that in his time the Tribe or Inhabitants of the <hi>Suburra</hi> was written <hi>Tribus Succurranea,</hi> not <hi>Suburrana</hi>; nor <hi>Suburana,</hi> as <hi>Varro</hi> would have it called, for being under the old Bulwark, <hi>sub muro terreo.

               <p>Verse 10. <hi>Poets that in August read.</hi>] Among the sufferings of those that lived constantly in <hi>Rome,</hi> my Author reckons the torment they were put to by the Poets, whom they could not be rid of, even in the moneth of August, when the extremity of heat was enough to kill a man that, being pressed by their importunity, must stand in the open Street to hear their ridiculous Verses read; and <hi>Vmbricius</hi> seems the more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the misery in regard it only fell upon the meaner sort; for all the great persons of <hi>Rome</hi> were then at their Country-houses, to which they removed upon the Calends or first day of July.</p>
               <p>Verse. 12. <hi>At the ancient Arc by moist</hi> Capena] An Arc was a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of stone raised like to the Arch of a Bridge in memory of some triumph or victory: and this Arc was built in honour of the <hi>Horatii:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it was called the distilling or dropping Arc, because over it the pipes were laid that carried the water into <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Egeria</hi>'s Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Ovid Fast.</hi>

He built the Temple of <hi>Janus,</hi> which being opened signified war; being shut, times of Peace: and all the whole Reign of <hi>Numa</hi> it was shut, but stood open after his death for fourty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He created the <hi>Dial Martial</hi> and <hi>Quirinal</hi> Flamens or Priests. He instituted a Colledge of Twelve Salian Priests of <hi>Mars.</hi> He consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Vestall Virgins: declared the <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> or Chief Bishop: distinguished the dayes <hi>Fasti</hi> and <hi>Nefasti,</hi> the Court-dayes, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or <hi>Justicium</hi>: divided the year into twelve moneths: and to strike a Veneration into the hearts of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and make them observe what he enjoyned, out of an awfull religious duty; he made them believe that every night he met a Goddess or Nymph which he called <hi>Egeria,</hi> from whose mouth he received his whole form of government: their place of meeting was in a Grove without the <hi>Porta Capena,</hi> called afterwards the Muses Grove, wherein was a Temple consecrated to them and to the Goddess <hi>Egeria,</hi> whose Fountain waters the Grove. <hi>Ovid</hi> that calls her <hi>Numa</hi>'s Wife saith likewise, that she grieving for his death, wept her self into a Fountain, <hi>Metamorph lib.</hi> 15. which Fountain, Grove and Temple at a yearly Rent were let out to the <hi>Jews,</hi> grown so poor after the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93027:64"/>
Sack of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that all their Stock was a Basket for their own meat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hay to give their Horses. Lastly King <hi>Numa,</hi> after he had reigned fourty years beloved and honoured by his own People and all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-States, died, not having any strugle with nature, meerly of old age. By his Will he commanded that his body should not be burned, but that two stone-Chests or Coffins should be made, in one of which they should put his Corps, and in the other the Books he had written, <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Numa,</hi> where he saith (and quotes his Author <hi>Valerius Ansius</hi>) that the Coffin of <hi>Numa</hi>'s Books contained four and twenty, twelve of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and twelve of Philosophy written in Greek. Four hundred years after, <hi>P. Cornelius</hi> and <hi>M. Baebius</hi> being Consuls, by a sudden inundation the earth was loosned, and the covers of the Coffins opened; but there was no part of his body found in the one, in the other all the Books intire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the earth and water: But <hi>Petilius</hi> (then Praetor) had the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, which occasioned their destruction by fire; for he acquanit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Senate with their Contents, it was not thought fit by the great Councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> that secrets of such a nature should be divulged to the People; so the books were brought into Court and burned.</p>
               <p>Verse 25. <hi>Vmbricius.,</hi>] A man rare at divination by the entrails of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed beasts, <hi>Pliny.</hi> He foretold the death of <hi>Galba, Tacit.</hi> but those honest Arts not bringing in sufficient to maintain <hi>Vmbricius</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> he scorned to use cozning Arts, by playing the Mountebank for a lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as you see by his words.

               <p>Verse 30. <hi>Daedalus,</hi>] An <hi>Athenian</hi> Handicraft-man, Sonne of <hi>Mition,</hi> the most ingenious Artist of his time. From his invention we have the Saw, the Hatchet, the Plummet and Line, the Auger, Glue and Cement. He was the Inventor of Sails and Sail-yards, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly occasioned the Fable of his invention of Wings. He set eyes in Statues, and by secret springs, wheels, and wyers, gave motion to those men of marble so artificially as they appeared to be living: an Art revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in the reign of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, by his Mathematician <hi>Janellus Turrianus.

They were admitted between six and eleven years of age, and were to remain in the Cloister thirty years; the first ten to learn mysterious Ceremonies, the next ten to practise them, and the last ten to instruct others. If in all these thirty years any Vestal was convicted of inchastity, she was led to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93027:79"/>
the <hi>Campus Sceleratus</hi> or Field of Execution, lying within the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> neer to the <hi>Colline</hi> Gate: <hi>Munster in sua Cosmog.</hi> there in her closs Chair let down into a Vault, wherein was a Couch, a Lamp burning, and a little meat: the hole they put her in was presently stopped up: <hi>Plutarch in Numa,</hi> and so this poor defloured Vestall like an Anchorite lived and died in her grave. The reason of this kinde of death and burial, was because they held it unlawfull to lay violent hands upon a Vestall, and unfit to burn her body, who had kept the sacred fire with no more sanctity.</p>
               <p>Verse 14. <hi>The Censor.] Domitian Caesar,</hi> that acting the Censor, had executed <hi>Cornelia</hi> a defloured Vestall according to the letter of the Law, and commanded Adulterers to be whipt to death in the <hi>Comitium,</hi> where the Judges sate.</p>

               <p>Verse 60.

               <p>Verse 97. <hi>Crispus.] Vibius Crispus,</hi> a rich subtle and smooth-tongu'd Orator, but his abilities were more in private causes then in publick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness: <hi>Quintil.</hi> He was born at <hi>Placentia: Tacit.</hi> and lived to be foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years old, in the several Courts of evill Emperors; yet he still kept in favour, by being (as the Marquess of <hi>Winchester</hi> in the like case said of himself) a Willow and not an Oak. In a Progress-time he followed <hi>Caesars</hi> Chariot on foot. When he was a Youth, <hi>Nero</hi> whispered him in the ear, and asked him, <hi>Crispus,</hi> hast thou ever enjoyed thy own Sister? he answered, not yet Sir: a cautious and a handsome return from one that would not own a crime he never committed, and yet durst not finde fault with any that should offend in the same kinde, it being <hi>Nero</hi>'s Case. In <hi>Domitians</hi> time, being asked if any one were with the Emperor, <hi>Crispus</hi> answered, not a flie Sir: <hi>Sueton.</hi> This was a pleasant but a sharp reply; for <hi>Domitian</hi> in the beginning of his Empire, used every day to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw for an hour only to kill flies. <hi>Crispus</hi> was twice Consull, twice mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and left an Estate of 00 H. S.</p>
               <p>Verse 113. <hi>Acilius.] Acilius Glabrio,</hi> a Man of singular prudence and fidelity: <hi>Plin.</hi> He was Consul with <hi>Vlp. Trajan</hi> eight hundred fourty five years after <hi>Rome</hi> was built, at the very time when <hi>Domitian</hi> commanded himself to be called Lord and God: <hi>Eutrop. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Sueton in Domit.</hi> That <hi>Acilius</hi> lived to be fourscore years old, and then sate in Councel about the Turbot, we have <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s authority; but after this he was charged with designs of innovation; so was the Youth that came to the Councell with him, his Son <hi>Domitius,</hi> and both of them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; yet was the old man's Sentence changed into Banishment, not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93027:82"/>
out of the Emperors mercy, but cruelty, that he might afflict himself with remembrance of the untimely death of his Son: who knowing his life was sought by <hi>Domitian</hi> at this time, soon after counterfeited mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in hope that would take off the Tyrant, in whose sight he fought naked with Lions in the <hi>Albane</hi> Theater, where <hi>Domitian</hi> at his own charge brought wilde beasts to be slain, and killed a hundred with his own hands: <hi>Sueton.</hi> This Impeachment against the Father and Sonne pretended to be for innovation in the State, was really upon suspicion that the Son had been converted to the Christian Faith; as I was told in <hi>Oxford</hi> by a Gentleman of worth, assuring me that he had the authority of a great Author for it, which I thought to be <hi>Eusebius</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> but having searched them both, I finde not <hi>Domitius</hi> recorded for a Martyr by either of them; and therefore in the Designe before this Satyr I only tell you, that some say he was a Christian.</p>
               <p>Verse 116. <hi>Old Lords shew'd like Prodigies long since.</hi>] Long before <hi>Domitian</hi> reigned, it was news in <hi>Rome</hi> to see an old Lord, for this bald <hi>Nero</hi> took his Pattern from <hi>Nero</hi> himself, <hi>qui nobilissimo cuique exitium destinabat, that singled out the noblest persons for destruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 124. <hi>A bearded King.] Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> whom <hi>Brutus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled, wore his beard long; for in his time the Barbers were not come over to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 125. <hi>Rubrius,</hi>] That in his youth committed some such foul crime as pathick <hi>Nero</hi> did, and being come to mans Estate, was as bold a Writer of Satyrs against others, as <hi>Nero</hi> was against <hi>Quintinian</hi> a notorious Pathick: <hi>Lub.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 128. <hi>Montanus. Curtius Montanus</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Tacitus</hi>) a huge fat Glutton, and a great Master in the Art of Cookery, whose

belly <hi>Juvenal</hi> here only takes notice of, but leaves him not so; you will meet him again in this Satyr.</p>
               <p>Verse 130. <hi>Pompey.] Pompeius Ruffus,</hi> not so gallant and fine a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier as the <hi>Arabarch Crispinus</hi> in his Oriental perfumes; yet was <hi>Pompey</hi> the subtler in whispering of accusations.</p>
               <p>Verse 132. <hi>Fuscus.] Cornelius Fuscus,</hi> that having only heard of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, and studied stratagems of Warre within the marble walls of his Villa or Country-house, was sent General by <hi>Domitian</hi> against the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> where his Army and <hi>Fuscus</hi> himself was lost.</p>
               <p>Verse 134. <hi>Veiento.</hi>] See the Comment upon the third Satyr.</p>
               <p>Verse 135. <hi>Catullus.] Catullus Messalinus</hi> a blinde man and a bloody Villain, whose informations cost many men their lives: <hi>Domitian</hi> used to cast him at great persons like a blinde dart that will spare no man: <hi>Plin.</hi> He was by this Emperor raised from begging at the foot of the <hi>Aricine</hi> Hill in the <hi>Via Appia,</hi> to be one of his Councellors of State, <hi>Domitian</hi> taking it for granted, that the tongue which begged so well would urge an accusation better.</p>
               <p>Verse 143. <hi>Cilicians.</hi>] Sword-players of <hi>Silicia</hi> whose art in fencing this blnde Parasite had commended upon the Theaters; as he had likewise praised the Engine (such as we have in Masks and Playes) that hoisted up the Boyes to the Clouds, or the blue Canvas which they called the <hi>Velaria,</hi> covering the top of the Theater: <hi>Xiphilin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 146. <hi>Bellona.] Minerva</hi> Goddess of War, (Sister to <hi>Mars</hi>) stiled likewise <hi>Enyo</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> whose Priests sacrificed their own blood to her, and immediately she so inspired them as to explane things present and foretell the future: before her Temple stood a Pillar called the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna Bellica,</hi> whereon lay the Spear which the <hi>Faecealis</hi> or Herald took

in his hand when he denounced war: <hi>Alexander ab Alexandro, lib</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Verse 150. <hi>Arviragus.</hi>] King of the South <hi>Britains</hi> youngest Son to <hi>Kymbeline,</hi> a great Enemy to the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Island, both in <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>'s reign (when it seems he flourished) and in <hi>Claudius Caesar</hi>'s, whose Daughter <hi>Genissa</hi> (if we may believe our <hi>British</hi> Historians that he had such a one) <hi>Arviragus</hi> married.</p>
               <p>Verse 159. <hi>Prometheus,</hi>] Son to <hi>Japet</hi> by his Wife <hi>Asia</hi>; an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Potter he must needs be, for he was the first (according to the Poets) that made a man of clay: thus runs the Fable. <hi>Minerva,</hi> extremely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his ingenious workmanship, promised to give him any thing the Gods had that would conduce to the perfection of his Art; and when <hi>Prometheus</hi> answered, that he could not conjecture how Celestial things would advantage him unless he took a view of them, <hi>Minerva</hi> carried him up to heaven, where finding all the heavenly bodies to be animated by fire, he thought that would be most instrumentall, and therefore with a Rule which he had in his hand he touched a wheel of the Sun's Chariot, and so with his Rule burning, he brought down to the Earth fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he made his man of clay. <hi>Jupiter,</hi> inraged at this presumptious theft, gave a Box to <hi>Pandora</hi> to be delivered to her Husband <hi>Epimetheus</hi> (Brother to <hi>Prometheus</hi>) which being opened by him, filled the world with innumerable diseases and calamities; as for <hi>Prometheus, Mercury</hi> was commanded to binde him to the Mountain <hi>Caucasus,</hi> where an Eagle continually fed upon his heart: but afterwards, when <hi>Jupiter</hi> fell in love with <hi>Thetis,</hi> and declared that he would marry her, <hi>Prometheus,</hi> skilfull in future events, deterred him from the Match, because he said it was decreed by the Fate, that the Sonne born of <hi>Thetis</hi> should be a greater
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93027:83"/>
Person then his Father; and <hi>Jupiter</hi> remembring how he had deposed his own Father <hi>Saturn,</hi> feared the same measure from his Son; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chose to loose <hi>Thetis</hi> rather then his possession of the Heavens. In recompence of the service done him in this discovery, <hi>Jupiter</hi> sent <hi>Hercules</hi> to <hi>Caucasus,</hi> where he killed the Eagle and unchained <hi>Prometheus.</hi> If I have trespassed upon your patience with this tedious Fable, I doubt not but to please you again with the Mythologie of it. <hi>Prometheus</hi> was the first that taught the <hi>Assyrians</hi> Astrology, which he had studied upon the top of the high Mountain <hi>Caucasus,</hi> not farre from <hi>Assyria</hi> and neer to the Heavens, from whence he could the easier discover the magnitude rising and setting of the Starres. An Eagle was said to tire upon his heart, because it was consumed with care, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of the celestial bodies: and being these were the acts of Prudence and Reason, <hi>Mercury,</hi> the God of both, was said to have chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the Mountain: moreover for that he shewed to men how thunder and lightning was generated, it was reported that he brought fire down from Heaven: <hi>N. Comes Mythol. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Verse 165. Falerne <hi>Wine.</hi>] That the Grapes growing upon the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerne</hi> Mountains in <hi>Campania</hi> made a rare Wine in <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s time, you may know by his frequent use of the word <hi>Falern,</hi> and at this day it is the absolute best Wine in <hi>Italy,</hi> as they say that have met with it where it is pure, which is only in the Cardinals or some great Princes Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Verse 167. Lucrin <hi>Rocks or</hi> Circe's.] The <hi>Lucrin</hi> Rocks were in the Bay of <hi>Lucrinum</hi> in <hi>Campania;</hi> the <hi>Rocks</hi> of Circe were about <hi>Cajeta,</hi> where was a Temple dedicated to <hi>Circe,</hi> and a Mountain that bore her name.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Verse 178. <hi>Flying Posts</hi>] Some conceive that <hi>Juvenal</hi> meant Carrier-Pigeons; but he calls them not flying Posts either for the speed of bird or man; but because in Packets of Overthrows or Insurrections, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> used to stick a Feather: in expresses of victory, a Lawrel: <hi>M.

The Scuffle between <hi>Sarmentus</hi> and <hi>Messius Cicerra</hi> is described by <hi>Horace</hi> in his Journall, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Sat.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Verse 7. <hi>The belly's cheaply fed.</hi>] A little contents nature: <hi>Senec. in his Epistles.</hi> Nature requires bread and water, no man as to these is poor. Wherein a man can limit his desires he may boast himself to be as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as <hi>Jove.</hi> Again he saith, Nature appoints but a little, and is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it: the belly hears no Precepts; it asks and calls, but is no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome Creditor, if you pay what you owe, not what it covets.

In pursuance of these Articles <hi>Saturn</hi> devoured his Sons.

crying of the Childe. Then she brought forth <hi>Neptune</hi> and put him to Nurse: to her Husband shewing (wrapt up in swadling clouts) a stone, which he devoured. In her third Child-bed she had Twins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Glauca,</hi> and, as before, concealing the Boy, shewed only the Girle to <hi>Saturn.</hi> All this being at last discovered to <hi>Titan</hi>; when he saw that his Brother's Sons would come between him and the Crown, he mustered his own Sonnes the <hi>Titans,</hi> defied his Brother <hi>Saturn,</hi> fought him, had the victory; and pursuing his Brother and Sister, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ops,</hi> took them both, and imprisoned them till such time as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown a man, defeated the <hi>Titans,</hi> setting at liberty his Father and Mother. Afterwards <hi>Saturn</hi> (hearing from the Oracle that his Son should dispossess him of his Kingdome) sought the life of <hi>Jupiter</hi>: whereof he had intelligence, and by way of prevention, seized the government of <hi>Creet</hi> into his own hands. <hi>Saturn</hi> fled into <hi>Italy,</hi> where in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of King <hi>Janus</hi> for some time he lurked; and from his <hi>Latitat</hi> that part of <hi>Italy</hi> was called <hi>Latium.</hi> Under the Reign of <hi>Saturn</hi> the Fabulists place the Golden Age, when the earth not forced by the Plough and Harrow, afforded of it self all kinds of grain and fruit, the whole ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe being then a Common, not so much as one Acre inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

Rosin. <hi>Ant. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. She is pictured sometimes in a Matrons habit, wearing a Garland of Corn with a handfull of Poppy or a Sheaf in one hand, and a Sickle in the other, as you may see upon the top of her Temple in the Designe before the twelfth Satyr: sometimes she is drawn with a sad look, as if she were seeking her Daughter <hi>Proserpine,</hi> stoln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by <hi>Pluto</hi> as she gathered flowers in the Vale of <hi>Aetna,</hi> where <hi>Ceres</hi> lighting a Lamp to search for her, fired the Mountain, which is like to burn for ever. In her travel to finde <hi>Proserpine, Ceres</hi> came to the Court of King <hi>Eleusius</hi> in <hi>Attica,</hi> where she was made Governesse to his Sonne <hi>Triptolemus,</hi> and tryed to make the Childe immortall, suckling him in the day time, but all night long she put him in the fire. <hi>Eleusius,</hi> wondring at the strange growth of his Sonne, set Spies upon the Nurse, which bringing him no discovery of any extraordinary means used by her in the day time, the King hid himself in her Chamber to watch her in the night, where seeing her thrust his sonne into the fire, the sudden fright made him call out to her to hold her hand. <hi>Ceres</hi> offended with the Kings curiosity, punished it with death. To the Childe she taught the art of sowing seed, and put him into a Chariot drawn with flying
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93027:120"/>
Dragons, that he might ride through the whole world and teach Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry to all Nations. The Nymph <hi>Arethusa</hi> giving intelligence to <hi>Ceres</hi> that <hi>Proserpine</hi> was in Hell, <hi>Ceres</hi> went to Heaven and expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with <hi>Jupiter</hi> of the injury done her by their Brother <hi>Pluto,</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing restitution of her Daughter, which was granted in case that <hi>Proser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> had eat nothing while she was in Hell. But <hi>Ascalaphus</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that he had seen her eat some of a Pomgranate which she plucked from the tree, as shee walked in <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Gardens, her return was obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for ever. For this testimony <hi>Ceres</hi> turned the Witnesse into an Owle. At last, to qualifie the griefe of his Sister, <hi>Jupiter</hi> consented that her Daughter <hi>Proserpine</hi> should be in Hell the one half of the year, and the other half-year upon the Earth. The <hi>Romane</hi> Sacrifices to the Goddesse <hi>Ceres</hi> were called <hi>sacra Graeca, Grecian Sacrifices,</hi> and the chief Priestesse <hi>Sacerdos Graeca,</hi> because those Ceremonies were brought to <hi>Rome</hi> out of <hi>Greece</hi> by <hi>Evander.</hi> The time of her Solemnities was at day-break, the Rites only performed by Women, that ran up and down with Lamps in their hands, helping <hi>Ceres</hi> to seek her Daughter. They that officiated in her Mysteries were injoyned silence; and therefore Wine was forbidden at that time, which was upon the 27. of <hi>March,</hi> being the fifth of the Calends of <hi>Aprill.</hi> For this reason the <hi>Romans</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Feast without Wine <hi>Cereris sacrificium, a Sacrifice to</hi> Ceres: Plaut. <hi>in Aulular.</hi> Into the Temple of <hi>Ceres</hi> no person durst presume to come that knew him or her self guilty of the least crime, much less they that had to answer for so great a sinne as lasciviousness, which is the sense of <hi>Juvenal</hi> in this place.</p>
               <p>Verse 53. <hi>Crown thy dores.</hi>] On wedding dayes the common sort of people crowned their dores and dore-posts with Ivie; the leaves, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93027:120"/>
and berries covering their very thresholds; but persons of honour instead of Ivie had Laurel, and builded Scaffolds in the streets for the people to behold the Nuptiall Solemnity, as you will see in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verses, when <hi>Lentulus</hi> is named.</p>

               <p>Verse 65. <hi>Bathyllus,</hi>] A Pantomime, that acted with his hands the wanton Mien of the Dancing-Mistress <hi>Laena,</hi> with whose postures, imitated by a man, the Country Ladies, <hi>Thuscia, Appula,</hi> and <hi>Thymele</hi> were much taken.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Verse 71. <hi>In</hi> Cybel's <hi>Games.</hi>] The <hi>Megalesian</hi> Games were Showes made in honour of the Goddess <hi>Cybele,</hi> the <hi>magna Mater</hi>; they began upon the fourth day of <hi>Aprill,</hi> and were continued for six dayes after, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time the common Play-houses were shut up. <hi>M. Junius Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> dedicated those sports to the Mother of the Gods.</p>
               <p>Verse 72. <hi>Thyrse.</hi>] The Thyrsus was a Spear wreathed about with Vine-leaves and grapes, proper to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which his Priests the Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanals carryed in their hands when they were possessed with their God; therefore in the seventh Satyr <hi>Juvenal</hi> sayes
<q>
                     <l>—soft aires to chant,</l>
                     <l>Or reach a Thyrsus, suits not with sad want.</l>
                  </q>
that is, a poor man can never come to be possessed with a Poeticall furie, as high as a <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> rage, because he wants money to buy wine.</p>
               <p>Verse 73. Autonoe's <hi>loose Jig.] Autonoe,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Cadmus</hi> King of <hi>Thebes</hi> by his Wife <hi>Hermione:</hi> she was married to <hi>Aristaeus,</hi> and by him had <hi>Actaeon,</hi> called the <hi>Autonoeian Heros</hi>: Ovid <hi>Metam. l.</hi> 3.

               <p>Verse 78. <hi>Quintilian,</hi>] The grave Rhetorician born at <hi>Calaguris</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>; he therefore called the <hi>Spaniards</hi> his Country-men. He came to <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Galba,</hi> and was Governor to <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Nephews. He first taught Rhetorick in <hi>Rome,</hi> was Tutor to <hi>Juvenal,</hi> had a Pension out of the Exchequer, and writ Rhetoricall Institutions and Declamations.</p>

               <p>Verse 89. Pharian <hi>Isle.] Pharos</hi> was a little oblong Isle of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; a dayes sail from the Continent, if we believe the authority of <hi>Homer;</hi> but now it is joyned by a Bridge to <hi>Alexandria:</hi> the change is ascribed to the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> whose seven channels cast up an infinite quantity of mud upon the Foards adjoyning: <hi>Ovid Metam. lib.</hi> 15.

                  <hi>See</hi> Plin. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 85. This Isle had a Tower of white Marble built upon a Rock, which cost <hi>Ptolomey Philadelphus</hi> eight hundred talents, <hi>Sostratus Gnidius</hi> being his Architect. The Tower bore the name of <hi>Pharos</hi>: and in the night hung forth a Lantern, by which the Ships at Sea sailed into the Haven. In this Isle <hi>Alexander</hi> the great resolved to build a City, but finding the place too narrow for his Modell, right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it he built the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> not far from the <hi>Canopian</hi> mouth

of <hi>Nilus:</hi> the ground was laid out by the rare Architect <hi>Dinocrates</hi> fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles in compass, cast into the fashion of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Cloak. Here <hi>Lagus</hi> lived that was Father of <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> successor to <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Aegypt</hi>; therefore <hi>Juvenal</hi> calls <hi>Alexandria</hi> the lewd walls of <hi>Lagus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 90. <hi>Nile,</hi>] A great <hi>Aegyptian</hi> River: some say the name of it was derived from King <hi>Nilus,</hi> others from the new slime or mud which it works up continually. It springs from a Mountain in the lower <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania,</hi> not far from the Ocean, in a Lake, which is called <hi>Nilis;</hi> then for some dayes journeys it runs underground; and again bursts forth within a greater Lake in <hi>Caesarian Mauritania,</hi> and again, swallowed up in the sands, for twenty dayes journeys it passeth through the Deserts to the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi>; at last spouts out of a Fountain called <hi>Nigris</hi>: then dividing <hi>Africa</hi> from <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> it makes diverse Islands, the noblest whereof is <hi>Meroe.</hi> After it hath received all recruits from confederate Rivers, it takes the name of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and dischargeth it self into the Sea by seaven mouths, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Canopian, Bolbitic, Sebennitic, Pharmitic, Mendesic, Tanic</hi> and <hi>Pelusiac.

Though <hi>Paris</hi> was highly commended in these verses, yet the Satyr of them (that touched his quality of a Player) so stung him, that he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a command of foot for the Author, and sent him with his Regiment as far as <hi>Aegypt</hi>: See the life of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> and the Designe before <hi>Sat.</hi> 16.</p>

After his death <hi>Janus</hi> was reputed a God; and King <hi>Numa</hi> built a Temple to him (as aforesaid) which stood open when the <hi>Romans</hi> were in warres, and was shut in times of peace.

But <hi>Philomela,</hi> being an excellent Work-woman, drew her sad story with her needle in such lively colours, that her Sister <hi>Progne</hi> knew the whole circumstance of the Rape: and to revenge her self of her cruel Husband, by the advice of the <hi>Maenades,</hi> she feasted him with the limbs of his and her Son <hi>Itys,</hi> which being known by the Childs head that was served-in for the second course; <hi>Tereus</hi> in his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would have killed his Wife; but whilst he was drawing out his Sword he saw her turned into a Swallow: <hi>Philomela</hi> was transformed into a Nightingale, <hi>Itys</hi> into a Pheasant: <hi>Tereus</hi> himself, admiring at their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis, was turned into a Lapwing, that still bears upon his head the creast of a fierce <hi>Thracian</hi> Souldier: <hi>See</hi> Ovid. <hi>Met.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Verse 683. <hi>Alcestis,</hi>] Wife to <hi>Admetus</hi> King of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> whose Cattle-keeper <hi>Jove</hi> himself had been; and therefore, as it seems, when his old Master was sick to death, <hi>Jove</hi> was contented with an exchange; so that if any one would die for <hi>Admetus,</hi> he might live. But this being an office distastefull to his whole Court and Kingdome, all excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, only Queen <hi>Alcestis</hi> cheerfully embraced the offer, and served her Husband with her life.

desired to marry his fifty Sons; but <hi>Danaus</hi> would not give way to the Treaty of a marriage with all or any of them, because the Oracle had fore-told him that he should die by the hand of a Son in Law: but <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptus</hi> moving it once again in the head of a strong Army (brought to force the consent of <hi>Danaus</hi> and his Daughters) the match was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

Some think this Fable signifies the Spring and Autumne, that every year pour out new varieties of flowers and fruits, yet never satisfie our expectations: <hi>See</hi> Lucret. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. Others take it to bear proportion to the whole life of man, and of all things in the world: which as they come in, go out, not leaving any long continued monument of what they were. There are that apply it to benefits conferred upon ingratefull persons, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish in the doing. <hi>Plato</hi> compares the split Tubs of the <hi>Beleides</hi> to the minde of an intemperate man, which is insatiable. <hi>Terence</hi> hath one that saith he is very like them, <hi>plenus rimarum sum, I am full of Leaks</hi>: But whosoever he was that writ the following Epigram, he fixes <hi>Plato</hi>'s sense, from an universal to a particular, exceeding well.</p>

               <head>The Comment UPON THE SEVENTH SATYR.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erse 1. <hi>Caesar.</hi>] The Emperor <hi>Domitian</hi>; such a favourer of learned men, that he sent many of the Virtuosi out of this world to perfect their knowledge in the next: and to the rest he gave an opportunity of following their studies in this life, by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning or banishing of them: Yet some few Poets, and very noble ones, tasted of his bounty, as <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Statius</hi>; both which he favoured, the first for his own sake, the other upon the score of his Minion the Player <hi>Paris,</hi> for whom <hi>Statius</hi> writ the Tragedy of <hi>Agave,</hi> and was well paid for his wit by <hi>Paris,</hi> that taught his great Master the art of incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging some Scholars. Therefore <hi>Juvenal</hi> in this Satyr commends both <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> but you may see it is for fault of a better; the Satyr appears through the Complement.</p>
               <p>Verse 4. Gabian <hi>Baths.] Gabium</hi> was a beggerly <hi>Volscian</hi> Town (See the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 3.) To be Master of a Bath there, was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a Fire-maker's place in a Bath at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 6. Aganippe's <hi>Vale.] Aganippe's</hi> Valley and Spring were in a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93027:147"/>
part of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> consecrated to the Muses. But instead of withdrawing to such privacie, as the old Poets used, want of Patrons and hunger forces the new ones, as Cryers of goods to be sold, to come upon a Stage built for that purpose, in large Courts where Chapmen might have room to flock about them.</p>
               <p>Verse 7. <hi>Clio,</hi>] One of the Nine Muses; her name signifies Glory: <hi>Hesiod. Theog.</hi> because glory is the aim of Poets. She was the Inventress of History, transmitting to posterity the actions of gallant men: <hi>Virg. de</hi> 9. <hi>Mus.</hi> VVas it not pitty that so noble a Muse for plain hunger should turn Cryer?</p>
               <p>Verse 9. <hi>Machaera,</hi>] A Cryer of Goods set to sale, one that was in <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s time, as well known at <hi>Rome,</hi> as He is now about <hi>London</hi> that cryes <hi>Stockins for the whole Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 13. <hi>Halcyone.] Halcyone</hi> was Daughter to <hi>Neptune</hi> and Wife to <hi>Ceyx.</hi> She sailing to the Oracle was shipwrackt, and being impatient cast her self into the Sea: but the Gods in pitty would not suffer her to be drowned; and therefore turned her into a Kings-fisher: <hi>Ovid. lib.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Verse 14. <hi>Tereus</hi>] King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> Son to <hi>Mars</hi> by the Nymph <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonis.</hi> He married <hi>Progne,</hi> that (finding, by her Sister <hi>Philomel's</hi> needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, who had cut out her tongue, and why he did it) called a Councell of her Gossips the <hi>Maenades,</hi> that were met to celebrate the Orgies of <hi>Bacchus</hi>; where by a general vote it was resolved, that she should treat her Husband, all the dishes at the Table being made out of his young Son <hi>Itys,</hi> severally cooked; and that, for a second course, one of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips should bring in the head of his Son <hi>Itys,</hi> and another the ravished <hi>Philomela.</hi> How all these four Princes were transformed, if you remember not <hi>Ovid,</hi> you may turn to the end of the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:93027:147"/>Verse 14. <hi>Oedipus,</hi>] Son to <hi>Laius</hi> and <hi>Jocasta</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Thebes.</hi> VVhen <hi>Jocasta</hi> was with childe of him, the King sent to the Oracle to know the fortune of his Ofspring, it was answered, The Queen would be delivered of a Son that should kill his Father. <hi>Laius,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve himself, when the Child was born, gave him to a Shepherd, charging the man, upon pain of his own life, to destroy the Infant. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd durst not obey the King, for accounting to the Gods; neither durst he disobey him, for fear of his threatnings; therefore he chose a middle way, and thrusting a Sword through the feet of the poor Babe, into the holes he put twigs of VVicker, by which he hung him upon a tree, thinking that want of sustenance would soon make an end of him. The Shepherd at his return to Court shewed the bloody sword to the King, confidently assuring his Majesty that his pleasure was fulfilled. But <hi>Phorbas,</hi> Shepherd to <hi>Polybius</hi> King of <hi>Corynth,</hi> going through the VVood (perhaps to make a visit to his Brother Shepherd) heard the Child, ran in, and took it down. Returning with all speed to <hi>Corynth,</hi> he presented the Babe, as a great rarity both of Fortune and Nature, to the Queen his Mistress, that was Childless. The Infant so pleased the Queen, that, as if the Gods had sent her a Child from Heaven, she bred him up as her own; and from the tumour of his feet, which his wounds had swelled, she called him <hi>Oedipus.</hi> VVhen he grew to be a good big Youth, and understood he was not Son to <hi>Polybius,</hi> he resolved to finde out his own Father. To this end he consulted the Oracle, that bid him goe directly to <hi>Phocis,</hi> where he should meet his Father: when he came thither, the <hi>Phocians</hi> were in an Uproar; which <hi>Laius</hi> coming to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, in the tumult <hi>Oedipus,</hi> not knowing him to be his Father, slew him. Then conceiving himself to be deluded by the Oracle, <hi>Oedipus,</hi> being
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93027:148"/>
out of hope to finde his Father, fell upon a new designe, undertaking the Sphinx, a Monster with a womans face, birds wings, and a dog's body. This <hi>Chimaera,</hi> from her fortification upon a Mountain in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> plundered and destroyed that Kingdome: nor would <hi>Apollo</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise any end to their miseries, till one came that could resolve the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's riddle. To such a knowing person <hi>Creon</hi> King of <hi>Thebes</hi> (that suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Son in Law <hi>Laius</hi>) offered in marriage the new Widow, his Daughter <hi>Jocasta.</hi> Many gallant men had died in the attempt, yet that was no discouragement to <hi>Oedipus,</hi> when a Kings Daughter was the prize for which his life was to be ventured. To the fatall place came <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and by the Sphinx was presently asked, <hi>What is't, That in the morning is a four-footed creature, two-footed at noon, at night three-footed?</hi> he answered, <hi>a Man</hi>; that in his infancy creeps upon hands and feet; in his full strength goes upright on his leggs; and in his decrepit age borrows one leg of the Carpenter, walking with a staffe. For grief to have her Aenigma thus unriddled, the Sphinx brake her neck; a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that <hi>Oedipus</hi> might well envy: for his was far sadder, to be rewarded with the marriage of his own mother <hi>Jocasta.</hi> But time at last unfolded to <hi>Oedipus</hi> the Riddle of his own fortunes. And when he knew that he had killed his Father, and married his Mother, in a rage he pluckt out his own eyes: and would have killed himself, but his hand was held by his Daughter <hi>Antigone,</hi> that led her blinde Father out of <hi>Thebes,</hi> when he was banished by <hi>Creon: Senec. in Oedip.</hi> and after <hi>Seneca</hi> I doubt a <hi>Theban</hi> Tragedy writ by <hi>Faustus</hi> would hardly sell, unless a rare Cryer preferred it: <hi>See Stat. in Thebaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 17 <hi>Asian.] Asian</hi> Slaves in the first edition: in the second, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Knights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:93027:148"/>Verse 19. <hi>Bithynian.] Bithynia</hi> is a Region of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> lying right against <hi>Thrace</hi> along the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea; for which reason <hi>Bithynia</hi> had once the name of <hi>Pontus: Euseb.</hi> Afterwards a People of <hi>Thrace</hi> that were called <hi>Thynians,</hi> passing over and possessing themselves of <hi>Pontus,</hi> it took from them the name of <hi>Bithynia: Plin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ca.</hi> 31. Divers other appellations this Country had, but was famous by no name at all, but this which my Author seems to give it, <hi>viz.</hi> a Nursery of Knights of the Post: it is only memorable for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that was buried at <hi>Libyssa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 20. <hi>Gallograecia.] Juvenal</hi> calls it new <hi>France</hi>; the ancient name was <hi>Galatia.</hi> When the <hi>Galls</hi> grew to be so populous that <hi>France</hi> could not contain them, first with sword and fire they over-ran <hi>Italy,</hi> took <hi>Rome,</hi> and straightly besieged the Capitol; but <hi>Camillus</hi> routed them and freed his own Country: <hi>See the Comment upon</hi> Sat. 2. Then the <hi>Galls,</hi> that like a Sea-breach had overflowed all <hi>Italy,</hi> after the storm was over, continued rolling: and loosing on the <hi>Roman</hi> side, got ground again in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Macedon</hi>; from thence, led by their General <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onorus</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> joyning, they passed into <hi>Asia,</hi> where, by consent of the King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> they planted themselves in a part of his Dominions, which was afterward called <hi>Gallograecia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 27. <hi>Thelesine,</hi>] A Poet, to whom (as some think) <hi>Juvenal</hi> writ this Satyr.</p>
               <p>Verse 28. <hi>Vulcan,</hi>] God of fire: See the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Verse 33. <hi>Ivy.</hi>] Poets were crowned with Bayes, Oak, Parsley and Ivy.</p>
               <p>Verse 36. <hi>Boyes Peacocks praise.</hi>] Children are much taken with the colours and beauty of the Peacock's Plumes, them they commend, but they give him nothing: if they can get a Peacock, they will pull his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93027:149"/>
and take from him that which they commended. In point of Vain-glory the Poet much resembles the Peacock, as he is described by <hi>Ovid. de Art. lib.</hi> 1.</p>

                  <l>Laudatas ostendit avis Junonia pennas:</l>

                  <l>Say nothing, and he shuts it up again.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Verse 40. <hi>Terpsicore,</hi>] One of the Nine Muses, the Inventress of Musick and Dancing. In her the greatest part of man's life rejoyces: <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 42. <hi>God.</hi>] Apollo.</p>
               <p>Vers. 46. <hi>Maculonus,</hi>] One of the Peacock-praisers, that accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated the reading Poets with his house, and furnished them with voices to cry them up, but bestowed nothing upon them.</p>
               <p>Verse 49. <hi>Pit.</hi>] By the Pit and Scaffolds for the People, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chestra for the Nobility, you may cleerly see, that <hi>Roman</hi> Poets read their Works upon a Stage, as solemnly as our Playes are acted, and their audience was as great. An Instance whereof my Author here gives you in the Poet <hi>Statius.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>To their dear Thebais the People throng,</l>

                  <l>He reads his Poem, that to hear it spoke</l>
                  <l>A lust affects the soul: yet when he broke</l>

               </q>
               <p>Verse 68. <hi>Aonian.</hi>] In <hi>Aonia</hi> (which is the mountanous part of <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia</hi>)
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93027:149"/>
there is a Spring consecrated to the Muses, from which <hi>Aonian</hi> Fountain they are called <hi>Aonides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 69. Pierian <hi>Caves,</hi>] At the foot of the Mountain <hi>Parnassus</hi> were certain Caves full of the <hi>Pierian</hi> Muses Deity, according to Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall tradition.</p>
               <p>Verse 70. <hi>Thyrsus,</hi>] The Spear or Javelin wrapt with Ivy, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Priestess <hi>of Bacchus</hi> carried in her hand, when she sacrificed to her God, crying <hi>Eu, hoe,</hi> as you see in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of these Javelin-bearers, <hi>Horace</hi> sacrifices one of his Odes to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and begins the second Staffe with a cry like to theirs.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Ohe, recenti mens trepidat metu</l>

               <p>Verse 80. <hi>Alecto,</hi>] That with her Snakes hissed <hi>Turnus</hi> into distraction: <hi>Virg. Aeneid. lib.</hi> 7. She is one of the Infernall Spirits that distract the mindes of guilty persons, therefore called <hi>Erinnes</hi> by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Furies are wicked thoughts, frauds, and hainous crimes of vitious men, which day and night torment their consciences: <hi>Cic. in Orat. pro Rosc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 87. <hi>Rubren Lappa,</hi>] A poor, but an excellent, Tragick Poet; therefore my Author thinks it just, that he should have as considerable a Pension from the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Common-wealths of <hi>Greece</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the Ancients for their Tragedies: Then should not <hi>Rubren</hi> be
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93027:150"/>
necessitated to pawn his Books and Cloak to <hi>Atreus</hi> the Broker.</p>
               <p>Verse 89. <hi>Numitor,</hi>] Another <hi>Maculonus,</hi> such a one as would not stick to call a Poet friend; but yet not part with a penny to keep his friend from sterving, though he could spare money enough to maintain a Wench and a Lion. That <hi>Juvenal</hi> meant this by some great person is apparent in the very name. For, <hi>Numitor</hi> was King of <hi>Alba,</hi> deposed by his younger Brother <hi>Amulius,</hi> who slew <hi>Lausus</hi> Son to <hi>Numitor,</hi> and made his Daughter <hi>Rhea Sylvia</hi> a Vestall Nun; that under pretence of a sacred Honour he might oblige her to Virginity. But she was got with Child (as the <hi>Romans</hi> believed) by God <hi>Mars</hi>; a miracle that was no point of faith at <hi>Alba.</hi> For <hi>Rhea</hi> suffered the rigor of the Law, being for breach of her vow buried quick in the bank of <hi>Tiber</hi>: sentence passing upon her Twins, that they should be drowned in the River; but they were cast a-shore, and found (sucking at the breasts of a VVolfe) by the Shepheard <hi>Faustulus.</hi> VVhen they came to be men, they slew their Uncle <hi>Amulius,</hi> restoring the Kingdome to their Father <hi>Numitor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 95. <hi>Lucan,</hi>] The rich and noble Poet that writ in <hi>Heroick</hi> verse the Civill VVars between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi>for which Poem <hi>Nero</hi> put him to death. He was born at <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and Nephew to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> that writ the Tragedies.</p>
               <p>Verse 97. <hi>Bassus.] Saleius Bassus</hi> and <hi>Sarranus</hi> lived in <hi>Domitians</hi> time, and were good Poets though poor men.</p>
               <p>Verse 101. <hi>Statius.] Papinius Statius,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> born of noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: his Ancestors were Epirots: his Father <hi>Papinius</hi> for his eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and integrity was made a Citizen of <hi>Naples,</hi> where he begot this Poet, that writ the Tragedy of <hi>Agave,</hi> the Poem called the <hi>Woods,</hi> began another of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and hath left us in twelve Books his <hi>Thebais</hi>

here mentioned by my Author, that calls it the Mistress of the people of <hi>Rome:</hi> they so courted it when <hi>Statius</hi> gave notice that he would read.</p>
               <p>Verse 111. <hi>Paris,</hi>] The handsome young Player; you read of him in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. in the Designe before it, you see him acting to the Ladies; and one of them, <hi>viz. Hippia,</hi> leaving him with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret then all her other relations.

                     <l>Regardless of her Husband's reputation,</l>
                     <l>The honour of her Sister, House and Nation,</l>
                     <l>She left her crying Babes: what may amaze</l>

                  </q>
He was, when <hi>Juvenal</hi> writ this Satyr, Favourite to <hi>Domitian Caesar</hi>: and neither the <hi>Camerini</hi> nor the <hi>Bareae,</hi> nor any other Lord in <hi>Rome</hi> so liberall to the Poets, his old Masters. To <hi>Statius</hi> he gave money; to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the Emperor's Commissions to be Praefects, Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; or to be Tribunes, Colonels of foot. Little thought <hi>Juvenal</hi> when he said this, that <hi>Paris</hi> would make him one of the number of his Poet-Colonels: but you may see him in the head of his Regiment, in the Designe before <hi>Sat.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Verse 106. <hi>Agave.</hi>] The Tragedy of <hi>Agave,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Cadmus</hi> and <hi>Hermione,</hi> &amp; Wife to <hi>Echion</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> by whom she had <hi>Pentheus,</hi> that being no lover of wine, and therefore a despiser of the Orgies of <hi>Bacchus</hi>: when he was King of <hi>Thebes</hi> was cut in pieces by the <hi>Maenades,</hi> his own Mother <hi>Agave</hi> being one of the Bacchanalian Murdresses: Hor. <hi>S. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Sat.</hi> 3.</p>

At first sight, this only seems to relate to common Rhetoricall Theams, wherein young Scholars incourage men to kill Tyrants: but if you look more narrowly into the Author's meaning, you will finde that he intends only to describe the sad condition of a Rhetorick-Master, that must endure to hear, over and over again, such declamations as have
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93027:154"/>
been inflicted for a divine Judgement upon a Tyrant. Witness the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusian</hi> Tyrant <hi>Dionysius,</hi> that beaten out of his Kingdome by <hi>Dion,</hi> taught School at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which is set forth by <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick in one of his Epistles thus, <gap reason="foreign">

And</hi> Dionysius <hi>presently returning, I rose up and saluted him, saying, This is not well</hi> Dionysius, <hi>that you should teach Schoole. He, conceiving that I condoled the loss of his Kingdome and bemoaned his present Misery, made this Answer, I am glad that yet</hi> Diogenes <hi>pitties me. But I, that had said this is not well, repeated my words again adding, Really this is not well, and it very much afflicts me, not that you have lost your Kingdome and the power of a Tyrant, but that we suffer thee</hi> Dionysius <hi>to live safe and free in</hi> Greece, <hi>after so much mischiefe as thou hast done by Sea and Land in</hi> Sicily.</p>

nor could you much blame the Rhetoricians for revenging themselves upon <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that had like to have prevented <hi>Juvenal</hi> in his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the poor Lawyer for a voyage into <hi>Africa:</hi> it being once a hundred to one that <hi>Hannibal</hi> might have sent the <hi>Roman</hi> Rhetoricians (out of

All these Rings were revenged by a poor Annulet (worn upon the finger of <hi>Hannibal</hi>) which, in the Collet, had a private box, a very small one, but yet large enough to hold preventive poyson: <hi>Sat.</hi> 10.
<q>

From <hi>Cannae Hannibal</hi> marched within three miles of the City: but the weather proved tempestuous, lightning and thundering, as if the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery of Heaven had been planted in defence of <hi>Rome.</hi> This suspended the resolution of <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Many great Officers of his Army congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated

his victory, and wished him for a day or two to rest himself and his forces. <hi>Maharbal,</hi> General of his horse, gave his vote for a present march to <hi>Rome.</hi> You will (said he) see the consequence of this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel five dayes hence, when you feast your victorious Commanders in the Capitol: let the horse follow them: let them behold <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself before they hear of his comming. No, sayes <hi>Hannibal,</hi> let the Enemy goe before us: the designe is glorious, but the way more difficult then can be suddenly imagined. He therefore commended the good intentions of <hi>Maharbal,</hi> but to act what he advised time must be taken. Then said <hi>Maharbal,</hi> The Gods have not made one man capable of all things; <hi>Hannibal,</hi> you know how to conquer, but you know not how to use your Conquest: <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 22.

At <hi>Cannae</hi> he lost the honour which he had formerly won upon the place, where he was overthrown by <hi>Sempronius Gracchus.</hi> Now <hi>Hannibal,</hi> in the declination of his fortune, having no better luck at Sea then at Land, was called home again to <hi>Carthage,</hi> besieged by <hi>Scipio Africanus. Scipio</hi> hearing that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was landed, met him at <hi>Zama,</hi> there fought him; slew twenty thousand <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and took very neer as many Prisoners. <hi>Hannibal</hi> fled, first to King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then to <hi>Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia</hi>: But the <hi>Romans</hi> demanded him of both these Kings, as Author of the breach of peace between <hi>Cartharge</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> so that <hi>Hannibal</hi> seeing no hope of safety for himself, put an end to all his own and the <hi>Romans</hi> fears and jealousies, by taking the poyson which he alwayes carried about him in his Ring.</p>
               <p>Verse 217. Hellen's <hi>Rape.] Hellen's</hi> Rape, <hi>Medea's</hi> Charms, and the Ingratitude of <hi>Jason</hi> (that married <hi>Creusa,</hi> putting away <hi>Medea</hi> the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93027:155"/>
preserver of his life,) and his Father <hi>Aeson</hi>'s Cure, these and the like were Cases argued in the Schools by <hi>Rhetoricians,</hi> to prepare them for Moot-Cases of the Law, and disputes at the Barre.</p>
               <p>Verse 230. <hi>Theodorus.] Chrysogonus</hi> and <hi>Pollio</hi> were <hi>Theodorians,</hi> for so they called those Rhetorick-Masters that read to their Pupils the works of <hi>Theodorus Gadareus.</hi> He was an excellent Orator, born at <hi>Gadara</hi> a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> City not farre from <hi>Ascalon;</hi> yet he chose to write himself of <hi>Rhodes: Strab. Hermagorus,</hi> that writ the Art of Rhetorick, was his Scholar, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> (afterward <hi>Caesar</hi>) when he retired himself to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> was one of his studious Auditors.</p>
               <p>Verse 235. <hi>Numidian.</hi>] In <hi>Rome</hi> the richest pillars were of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Marble: and it seems that some wealthy Voluptuaries had Dining-rooms which turned round upon those Pillars, that they might command the Sun, have as much or as little of his light and heat as they would, or if they pleased none at all.</p>
               <p>Verse 241. <hi>Poor two.</hi>] Two Sestertia came but to five pound at most by <hi>Lubins</hi> account: but sure the place is false printed; it should be fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pound at least; which <hi>Juvenal</hi> thinks to be a mean annuall Stipend for a Rhetorick-Master to receive from his Pupil's Father; but he tells you
<q>Nothing costs Fathers less then Sons.—</q>
A Sentence that holds as true in our times, as it did when my Author was living, or when <hi>Crates</hi> cryed out of a Window to his fellow Citizens the <hi>Thebans, O Country-men, what madness hath possessed you? you have a great care of the goods you will leave to your Children, and no care at all of the Children to whom you will leave those goods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 242. <hi>Quintilian.</hi>] See the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. He is often
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93027:156"/>
named, never without honour, by his Scholar <hi>Juvenal:</hi> that in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr prayes
<q>
                     <l>Grant Heav'n, that gentle weightless Earth may lie</l>
                     <l>On our Forefathers bones, and sprout on high</l>
                     <l>In flowr's, which to the aire perfumes may bring,</l>
                     <l>Clothing their Urns in a perpetual Spring;</l>

                     <l>To be the sacred Parents Substitute.</l>
                  </q>
This Prayer was made by <hi>Juvenal</hi> out of the Principles of his Tutor <hi>Quintilian,</hi> that writes thus; <hi>In the mean time, of one thing I admonish Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, That they love their Tutors no less then their Studies, and believe them to be the Parents not of their boates, but of their mindes</hi>: lib. de Discip. Officio.</p>
               <p>Verse 257. <hi>Ventidius.] Ventidius Bassus,</hi> Son to an <hi>Ascalon</hi> Bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. He was taken and led through <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Cn. Pompeius Strabo</hi> (Father to <hi>Pompey</hi> the great) when he triumphed for his victory over the <hi>Picenians.</hi> He was first a Car-man, then a Muliteer: afterwards he was in one year created Praetor and Consul. He was made General against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and returned to <hi>Rome</hi> triumphant. So that he, who at first was Prisoner to a <hi>Roman</hi> General, and lay in a Dungeon, at last, as General of the <hi>Roman</hi> forces, filled the Capitol with <hi>Parthian</hi> spoils. <hi>See Val. Max. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>A. Gell. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Verse 257. <hi>Tully] M.

Who his Father was we know not; some think him a parallel to our good-man <hi>Plantagenet;</hi> for they say he derived himself from <hi>Tullius Attius,</hi> one of the old <hi>Volscian</hi> Kings; but others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93027:156"/>
him to be a Fuller of Cloth: <hi>Plutarch in Cic.</hi> It seems <hi>Cicero</hi> was of very mean Parentage: <hi>Sat</hi> 8.
<q>
                     <l>—</l>
                     <l>This new man <hi>Tully,</hi> this poor Arpinate,</l>
                     <l>Late made at <hi>Rome</hi> a Country-Gentleman.</l>
                  </q>
Nor was he ashamed of the meanness of his birth; for when some friends moved him to change his <hi>Plebeian</hi> name of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that smelt of pease: he told them, he would keep it, and make it as noble as the <hi>Scauran</hi> or <hi>Catulan</hi> name. <hi>Plutarch.</hi> And he was as good as his word; for, besides his first place in the Catalogue of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Orators and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, he obliged his Country by making many wholsome Lawes, and by abrogating the <hi>Lex Agraria, the Law for division of Lands,</hi> which had cost so much blood since it was passed by <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>Tib. Gracchus,</hi> heads of the Levelling Party: but his highest honour, the title of <hi>Pater Patriae, Father of his Country,</hi> was given him for delivering <hi>Rome</hi> from the fire and sword of <hi>Catiline</hi> and his fellow Conspirators. In his old age he was proscribed and slain by the tyranny of <hi>C. Octavius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Marc. Antony,</hi> because he too much favoured a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Verse 259. <hi>Slaves,</hi>] Such as <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> and <hi>Ventidius,</hi> the Sons of Bond-women, but raised by fortune; the first to wear a Crown: and the other, victorious Laurel.</p>
               <p>Verse 263. <hi>Thrasimachus,</hi>] A <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> Scholar to <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> publick professor of Rhetorick; but his gettings so inconsiderable; that he left teaching Schoole, and (some say) hanged himself.</p>

he was banished by <hi>Caligula</hi>; some say that he poysoned him.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erse 1. <hi>Ponticus,</hi>] The Noble Person to whom <hi>Juvenal</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects this Satyr, writ against such as degenerate from their illustrious Ancestors.</p>
               <p>Verse 3. <hi>Aemilii,</hi>] Generalls of the <hi>Aemilian</hi> Family, to whom the Lords of the Senate had decreed the honour of triumph; such as <hi>P. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius Macedonicus,</hi> that was commanded to put on his triumphall Robe
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93027:169"/>
in the Senate-house: and <hi>Scipio Aemilianus,</hi> that destroyed <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Numantia,</hi> as aforesaid. The Marble Statues of these <hi>Aemilii</hi> (it should seem) were not broken or weather-beaten, but whole and fresh, when this Satyr was writ.</p>
               <p>Verse 4. <hi>Curii,</hi>] Statues of the <hi>Curii</hi>; which Time, beginning at the feet, had eaten away with his iron teeth to the very waste.</p>
               <p>Verse 5. <hi>Corvinus.] Valerius Corvinus,</hi> Military Tribune under the Generall <hi>Camillus,</hi> when he pursued the routed <hi>Galls.</hi> In their flight they made a stand, and one of the <hi>Galls</hi> challenged any of the <hi>Roman Army. Corvinus</hi> accepted the Challenge. At day-break, when they met, a Crow flew to <hi>Valerius,</hi> sate upon his helmet, and in the Combat peck't at the face and eyes of the <hi>Gall.</hi> When <hi>Valerius</hi> had killed his Enemy, besides the usual reward for such a service, he was honoured with the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Corvinus</hi> or <hi>Crow.</hi> He was six times Consul, and in perfect strength of body and mind lived to be a hundred years of age: <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Dec.</hi> 1. but his Statue was not so long lived for marble as he was for a man, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it would not have wanted one shoulder in <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>Verse 6. <hi>Galba.</hi>] In his Court <hi>Galba</hi> had set forth his Pedegree, wherein he derived himself, by his paternal Line, from <hi>Jove</hi>; by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, from <hi>Pasiphae.</hi> Was not <hi>Jove</hi> obliged in point of honour to keep on his Nephew <hi>Galba</hi>'s nose and ears? yes sure, and would have done it, if he had not wanted power: But how could he preserve the Statue of a great-great-Grand-childe, when the Gods were so much out of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that his Son, the God of Warre, was not able to guard his Armes; for, my Author tells <hi>Sat.</hi> 13. that

                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:93027:169"/>Verse 7. <hi>Dictator.</hi>] Among the <hi>Romans,</hi> their Dictators differed from their Kings only in title and duration of their Offices: for, the King had his by inheritance, the Dictator only for six moneths, unless the Senate continued it for six moneths longer, upon the same sad necessity that made him be chosen, <hi>viz.</hi> the misery of a War. He was called Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Speaker, because his Word was Law, <hi>Quoniam dictis ejus parebat populus.</hi> There lay no appeal from his Sentence to the People; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was titled <hi>Populi Magister, Master of the People: Pigh.</hi> His first Act after election, was to choose his <hi>Equitum Magister,</hi> which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster (as I take it) we call General of the horse, that was Vice-Dictator; for in the Dictators absence he had the same unlimited authority: <hi>Stad. in Flor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. To be descended from a Dictator, or from a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the horse, must needs be great honour to a <hi>Roman</hi> that had perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall worth: VVhat followes?
<q>
                     <l>But who will honour him that's honour's shame,</l>
                     <l>Noble in nothing but a noble name.</l>
                  </q>
Hear a divine Phylosopher to this purpose. If there be any good in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy it is this, it looks not upon Pedegrees. Philosophy found not <hi>Plato</hi> Noble, but left him so: <hi>Senec.</hi> Add to this the authority of a Philosophicall Orator, though in his own Case. It is enough for me to flourish in my own Actions, rather then to rest in the fame and opinion of my Ancestors: let me live so, that I may be to my Descendents the beginning of their Nobility: <hi>Cic. in Sallust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 9. <hi>Pictur'd Worthies,</hi>] The Author names the <hi>Lepidi,</hi> which must needs be a very great Family, coming from that Worthy the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex Max. Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> that in his Childhood slew an enemy in a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, for which, by decree of Senate, in the Capitol his Statue was set up
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93027:170"/>
in his Praetexta (or Gown guarded with purple silk) to shew that he was a Noble-man's Son; and in his Bulla's (or golden Bubbles) to signifie that he was a Child when he merited that honour.</p>
               <p>Verse 12. <hi>Numantians.</hi>] The <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders that served un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Scipio</hi> at the siege of <hi>Numantia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> a Town that for twenty years maintained war against the <hi>Romans:</hi> and after it was belegur'd for 14. years, did not only hold out against 46000. <hi>Romans,</hi> but still worsted the Besiegers: at last, after a long and hard Siege laid to the place by <hi>Scipio Minor</hi>; when hunger had conquered the sterved <hi>Numantians,</hi> and that they wanted Souldiers to man the works, they fired themselves and all they had, leaving nothing to the Besiegers but more field-room.</p>
               <p>Verse 15. <hi>Fabius.] Fabius Maximus</hi> (the noble Ancestor of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <hi>Fabius Persicus,</hi>) from his conquest over the <hi>Allobrogians</hi> or <hi>Dauphinois,</hi> surnamed <hi>Allobrogick.</hi> Fabius Maximus <hi>Gallica Victoria cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomen Allobrogici sibi &amp; posteris peperit:</hi> Fabius Maximus, <hi>for his French Victory, got the surname of</hi> Allobrogick [<hi>or</hi> French] <hi>to himself and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>: Val. Max. This Family derived themselves from <hi>Hercules,</hi> to whom the <hi>Romans</hi> consecrated two Temples, one at the <hi>Porta Trigemina,</hi> the other in the <hi>Roman Smithfield</hi> or <hi>Forum Boarium</hi>; which Altar was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary to the <hi>Fabians: Liv.</hi> This <hi>Fabius Persicus</hi> is called the most filthy and the most obscene of all men living: <hi>Sen. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 30. <hi>de Benef.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 18. <hi>Euganeans.</hi>] The Sheep that were bred upon the <hi>Euganean</hi> Downes and Vallies had the finest and softest wool in <hi>Italy.</hi> Some say that <hi>Padua</hi> belonged to the <hi>Euganeans</hi>; others affirme them to be the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines, Calabrians</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi>: but <hi>Pliny</hi> is for the first opinion, he tells us <hi>Verona</hi> was a City of the <hi>Euganeans,</hi> which is but a mile from <hi>Padua:</hi> Plin. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.</p>

                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:93027:170"/>Verse 19. <hi>Sicilian.</hi>] The best Pumice-stones are gathered in <hi>Sicily,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Mountain <hi>Aetna.</hi> With these Pumices the <hi>Italians</hi> did smooth their skins, but now they use for the same purpose a Specifick earth.</p>
               <p>Verse 23. <hi>Waxen Imagerie,</hi>] Heads of Wax were set up in all Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes or Galleries: <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 35. A Court full of dusty Images makes not the owner noble: no man lived for our honour: what was before us, is not ours. It is the minde that nobilitates. VVho is generous? He that is virtuously given: <hi>Senec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 25. <hi>Paulus.] Paulus Aemilius</hi> or <hi>Aemylius</hi> (that in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship led <hi>Perseus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> in triumph) drew his Pedegree, as aforesaid from <hi>Mamercus, Pythagoras</hi> the Philosopher's Son, by the <hi>Grecians</hi> surnamed <hi>Aemylos</hi> for his civility.</p>
               <p>Verse 25. <hi>Cossus,</hi>] That in a battail slew the General of the Enemy, and so brought into the Capitol the <hi>Spolia opima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 25. <hi>Drusus,</hi>] One that won more then the <hi>Spolia opima</hi> from a General of the Enemy, slain by his hand in the field: for, the General's name was <hi>Drusus</hi>; which name he carried away, and left to his Posterity.</p>
               <p>Verse 27. <hi>Fasces,</hi>] The bundle of Rods with an Axe in it, carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Consuls and Praetors by their Lictors, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Verse 36. <hi>Osyris.</hi>] VVhy the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> kept the Anniversary of <hi>Osy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and every year upon the day of his death sought for him with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mourning and howling, I have told you in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. I shall in this place add the opinion (not without probability) that <hi>Joseph</hi> was <hi>Osyris,</hi> and then you will assigne another cause for seeking him. <hi>Moses</hi> having carried away his bones, and only left to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> a desire of <hi>Joseph</hi> and the memory of his virtues, which they celebrated with this ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Ceremony, howling till they found him, and then shouting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:93027:171"/>Verse 45. <hi>Creticus.</hi>] One of the House of <hi>Metellus</hi> surnamed <hi>Creticus,</hi> from his Conquest of <hi>Creet.</hi> That the <hi>Camerini</hi> were very great <hi>Romans</hi> needs no other evidence, but only the naming of them and the <hi>Bareae</hi> for all the cliented and courted Lords of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Sat.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>Verse 48. <hi>Rubellius Plautus.</hi>] All the <hi>Juvenals</hi> I have seen do write, as it is printed in the Louvre-copy, <hi>Rubellius Blandus</hi>: but no Author takes notice of any such kinsman to <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> and <hi>Drusus</hi>: therefore I follow <hi>Justus Lipsius,</hi> that reads it <hi>Rubellius Plautus,</hi> he being in as neer a degree of relation to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> by the Mothers side, as <hi>Nero</hi> was. All men cry up <hi>Rubellius Plautus</hi> that by his Mother had the Nobility of the <hi>Julian</hi> Family: <hi>Tacit. lib.</hi> 13.14.</p>
               <p>Verse 49. <hi>Drusian.] Tiberius Caesar</hi> and his Brother <hi>Drusus</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from <hi>Tiberius Nero</hi> that conquered <hi>Asdrubal: Suet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 54. <hi>Bleak Mount.] Tarquin</hi>'s Mount, where very poor women got a sad lively-hood, by weaving and knitting in the wind.</p>
               <p>Verse 65. <hi>Euphrates,</hi>] A River of <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> This River rises upon the Mountain <hi>Niphates</hi>; and the fall from such a Precipice makes the stream large, deep and swift: it runs into the red Sea, but first joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the River <hi>Tygris</hi> it makes <hi>Mesopotamia: Strab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 57. <hi>Cecropian.] Cecrops</hi> was the first King of <hi>Athens.</hi> Sure the <hi>Romans</hi> were excellent Heralds, that could bring a Descent from this King who reigned before <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s Flood, <hi>Ante</hi> Deucalionis <hi>tempora regem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buêre Cecropem, Before</hi> Deucalion's <hi>time they had</hi> Cecrops <hi>for their King</hi>: Justin. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. He founded <hi>Athens.</hi> They drew him in his Picture male and female; for that he first joyned man and woman in Matrimony: Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin. <hi>ibid.</hi> Euseb. <hi>in praef.

He first coined the name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> built Altars in <hi>Greece,</hi> and some say invented the <hi>Greek</hi> Alphabet. He was called <hi>Diphyes</hi> or double-natured, some think either from the height of his body, or that, being an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> he spake both his own and the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue: but I rather believe he had the attribute <hi>Diphyes</hi> as he had his Picture in two shapes, for joyning the nature of the male and female.</p>
               <p>Verse 68. Mercury's <hi>old Statue.</hi>] The <hi>Hermae</hi> or <hi>Athenian</hi> Statues of <hi>Mercury</hi> had Marble heads, but the other parts were of course stuffe. It was the custome of <hi>Athens,</hi> when the State would reward a deserving man, to send him two or three of these Statues, which he placed over his Gates: <hi>Thucid.</hi>
               </p>

He grew to such a height of villany, that he spared not his own family, but was to his Mother, brother, Wife, and all his neerest relations, a bloody Parracide: <hi>Euseb. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. <hi>Hist. Eccl.</hi> For which my Author intimates that <hi>Nero</hi> deserves a thousand deaths, and therefore it would be too milde a Sentence that should condemn him as a single Parracide, to be sowed up in a Sack with a Dog, Cock, Viper and Ape, and cast into the Sea; perhaps lest his naked body should defile the Element of water, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes out the filth from other things: read <hi>Senec. lib.</hi> 5.

                  <hi>cap.</hi> 21. Cic. <hi>pro</hi> Sext. Rosc. In the next place my Author aggravates <hi>Nero</hi>'s murder of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93027:176"/>
his Mother, comparing it with the very same Crime committed by <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,</hi> but not with the same intention, nor seconded with the like cruelties. For, first <hi>Orestes</hi> took himself to have a Commission from the Gods to kill his Mother, in revenge of his Father, murdered by her, when he had drunk hard at the Feast she made to welcome him home, after his ten years absence at the siege of <hi>Troy. Homer</hi> agrees with <hi>Juvenal,</hi> that of the Matricide committed by <hi>Orestes Jove</hi> was Author, and sent <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to bid <hi>Aegysthus</hi> take heed of imbruing his hands in <hi>Agamemnon's</hi> blood; for if he did, <hi>Orestes</hi> should revenge it upon his Mother and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gysthus: Hom. Odyss.</hi> Then, <hi>Nero</hi> slew his Sister in Law <hi>Antonia</hi>; but <hi>Orestes</hi> did not kill his Sister <hi>Electra,</hi> nor his Wife <hi>Hermione,</hi> as <hi>Nero</hi> killed his VVife <hi>Poppaea</hi>; nor poysoned he his neerest relations as <hi>Nero</hi> poysoned his Brother <hi>Britannicus.</hi> Nor did <hi>Orestes</hi> in his frenzie commit a Crime equal to <hi>Nero,</hi> when he writ his Troicks, which <hi>Juvenal</hi> urges as the greatest of his cruelties; for they put him into a humour of setting <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, only that he might sing his verses of <hi>Troy</hi> burning, by <hi>Rome</hi> in the like condition. Lastly, for the Imperial Crown of his impiety, he charged the fact upon the Christians, condemning those poor Innocents, for that which he himself had done, to be tortured in pitch't Cassocks fit for <hi>Catiline</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> (as <hi>Juvenal</hi> here sayes) that would have fired <hi>Rome</hi>; and therefore fittest of all for <hi>Nero,</hi> that did it. This torture is fully described in <hi>Sat.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Verse 285. <hi>Vindex.] C. Julius Vindex</hi> Governor in <hi>France,</hi> the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the rebellion against <hi>Nero</hi>; not upon his own score, but upon the account of <hi>S. Sulpitius Galba</hi> Lievtenant in <hi>Spain,</hi> for whom both <hi>Vindex</hi> &amp; <hi>Virginius Rufus</hi> Governor in <hi>Germany</hi> declared themselves: and <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> thinks all three had done well, if they had declared against <hi>Nero</hi> for
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93027:177"/>
the burning of <hi>Rome,</hi> and revenged in the first place his malice to his Country.</p>
               <p>Verse 390. <hi>Parsley-Crown.] Nero</hi> in the <hi>Isthmian</hi> prizes had carried away the Parsley-Crown from the <hi>Greek</hi> Musick-Masters.</p>
               <p>Verse 292. Thyestes <hi>long train.] Thyestes</hi> was Son to <hi>Pelops</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podamia.</hi> He, to spight his Brother <hi>Atreus,</hi> made him Cuckold; <hi>Atreus,</hi> to revenge himself, first banished <hi>Thyestes,</hi> then repealed his banishment and feasted him with the flesh of those Sons which he himself had begot upon the body of his Wife <hi>Aetope. Thyestes,</hi> to out doe his Brother, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floured his own Daughter <hi>Pelopea,</hi> by whom he had <hi>Aegysthus</hi> that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in the murder of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> Son to <hi>Atreus.</hi> In this Tragedy of <hi>Atreus</hi> (so horrid that Historians say the Sun could not have patience to behold it, but went back into the East) <hi>Nero</hi> played the part of <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes:</hi> and <hi>Juvenal</hi> thinks, that when the Play was done, <hi>Nero</hi> might have hung the long Vest, which he acted in, upon the Statue of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor <hi>Cn. Domitius,</hi> as well as he hanged upon the Statue of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> the Lute decreed him by the Judges of the Musick-exercises, he having first kissed and adored it: <hi>Suet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 293. Antigone's <hi>and</hi> Menalippe's <hi>Tyre.</hi>] That we may know <hi>Nero</hi> acted upon the Stage both Mens and Womens parts, my Author bids him put upon the head of <hi>L. Domitius Nero</hi> the Tyre in which he played <hi>Antigone,</hi> that led her blind Father <hi>Oedipus,</hi> as aforesaid: and on the head of <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus</hi> to put the dress in which he played the part of <hi>Menalippe,</hi> got with child by <hi>Neptune,</hi> imprisoned by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in a Stable delivered of a boy, that was almost stifled with the stink of the place, and therefore called <hi>Baeothus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 296. <hi>Cethegus,</hi>] One of the Conspirators with <hi>Catiline</hi> that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93027:177"/>
to fire <hi>Rome:</hi> the barbarous <hi>Galls</hi> did no more. Was this a designe fit for <hi>Romans</hi> and persons of honour, as they were?</p>
               <p>Verse 300. <hi>Pitcht Cassocks,</hi>] Made for poor Christians: See the end of the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Verse 302. <hi>New man.] Cicero</hi>'s Enemies, in scorn of his mean birth, called him <hi>novus homo, new man</hi>; and the poor <hi>Arpinate,</hi> because he was born among the <hi>Volscians</hi> at <hi>Arpinum,</hi> now <hi>Abruzzo</hi>; then a poor Town, yet enobled by two famous Natives, <hi>M. Tullius Cicero</hi> and <hi>C. Marius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 306. <hi>The Gown.] Hail thou that wer't first stiled Father of thy Country, thou that in the Gown did'st first deserve a triumph and the laurell of the tongue.</hi> Thus the spirit of <hi>Cicero</hi> is complemented by <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. Father of his Country, was a title by <hi>Cato</hi> conferred upon <hi>Tully</hi> for preserving <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Catiline, Cethegus,</hi> and the rest of their faction.</p>
               <p>Verse 308. <hi>Caesar.] Augustus Caesar,</hi> second Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> Consul with <hi>Cicero</hi> in the year, from the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> 722. He overthrew <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> and defeated <hi>Marc. Antony</hi> at the battail of <hi>Actium,</hi> where he built a City, and named it from his victory <hi>Nicopolis: Plutarch.</hi> He reigned fifty six years. In his time learning flourished: then in <hi>Rome</hi> lived <hi>Virgil, Horace, Sallust. Hortensius, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodorus, Tarseus</hi> and <hi>Sitio Alexandrinus: Eutr. lib.</hi> 7. But in <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s opinion, neither his conquest at Land nor his Sea-victory merited so much honour from his Country, as those services done in the Gown by <hi>Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 313. <hi>Marius,</hi>] Another poor <hi>Arpinate</hi> born in the same Town with <hi>Cicero.</hi> His Father <hi>C. Marius</hi> and his Mother <hi>Fulcinia</hi> wrought for their living: <hi>Plut.</hi> and so did he himself when he first came to the Army: <hi>Juv.</hi>

                     <l>The Vine that paid him, when the lazy Cramp</l>

After he was a Souldier, by degrees he rose from one office to another, till at last the Consul <hi>Metellus</hi> made him his Lievtenant-Generall in <hi>Numidia,</hi> where he took King <hi>Jugurth,</hi> and drive him into <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wheels of his triumphant Chariot: for which service the <hi>Romans</hi> looked upon him as the only great Souldier, able to defend them when they trembled at the invasion of the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> and <hi>Teutons.</hi> He was then chosen Consul five times together. In his fifth Consulship, when he had <hi>Catulus</hi> for his Collegue, he overthrew the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> and <hi>Teutons.</hi> He was defeated by <hi>Sylla,</hi> and hid himself in the <hi>Minturnian</hi> Fens in <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where he was found, cast into a Dungeon by the <hi>Minturnians,</hi> and a <hi>Cimbrian</hi> sent to murder him: But the Executioner fled from the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whose eyes (as he said) shot forth a flame of fire. Then the Town, possessed with the like fear, suffered <hi>Marius</hi> to make an escape; and in a small Pinnace he passed over into <hi>Africa,</hi> where <hi>Juvenal</hi> sayes <hi>Sat.</hi> 10. that he begged his bread in conquered <hi>Carthage.</hi> When <hi>Cinna</hi> had sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into his hands the government of <hi>Rome,</hi> he called-in <hi>Marius,</hi> that, destroying his enemies, was the seventh time chosen Consul; and then dyed in <hi>Rome</hi> of a Pleurisie: <hi>Plut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ver. 317. <hi>Cimbrians.</hi>] The <hi>Cimbrians</hi> are the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Holsatians,</hi> that, with the rest of the <hi>Germans,</hi> are called <hi>Teutons,</hi> from their God <hi>Tuesco: Versteg.</hi> These, bodying in a vast Army, were upon their march for <hi>Rome,</hi> in the year 640. but <hi>Marius</hi> cut them off, as aforesaid: they were men of huge giantly bodies, and horrid looks. The <hi>Cimbrians</hi> used to rejoyce at a battail, where, if they fell, they should die gloriously upon the bed of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: but they lamented in their sicknesses, as if they were to perish basely: <hi>Val. Max.</hi>

                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:93027:178"/>Verse 321. <hi>Second Laurel.</hi>] He wore the first when he led King <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurth</hi> in triumph.</p>
               <p>Verse 322. <hi>Collegue.] Marius</hi> in his fifth Consulship was Collegue to <hi>Q. Catulus,</hi> a person nobly born. Both, as equalls in the service of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving their Country from the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> were equalized in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of triumph.</p>
               <p>Verse 323. <hi>Decii,</hi>] The <hi>Decii</hi> were Plebeians, but men of more then Patrician courage; for they devoted their lives as voluntary Sacrifices for the benefit of their Country; the Father in the war with the <hi>Latines</hi>: the Son in the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> war: the Grandchild in the war that King <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> made for the <hi>Tarentines.</hi> The first <hi>Decius,</hi> when he was Generall in the <hi>Latian</hi> war, dreamed the victory would fall to them whose Generall should be slain. Taking this for a Revelation from the Gods, he charged the enemy so far, till he got, that which he came for, his death. Whilst the <hi>Roman</hi> Army fought to fetch off his body, his dream proved true; for the Victory fell to them. The second <hi>Decius,</hi> in the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> warre, devoted his life in these words, <hi>Vpon my head be all the miseries that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my Country</hi>: presently he was slain, and the <hi>Romans</hi> had the day. From the premisses <hi>Juvenal</hi> concludes, that in the Estimate of the Gods the <hi>Decii</hi> were equall to the State of <hi>Rome</hi>; because these two private persons were, by commutation, accepted for the whole Republik.</p>
               <p>Verse 329. <hi>He.] Servius Tullius,</hi> Son to <hi>Oericulana</hi> a bond-woman. After the murder of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> by the Sons of <hi>Ancus Martius, S. Tullius</hi> was crowned King of <hi>Rome: Val.</hi> He reigned 44 years.</p>
               <p>Verse 331. <hi>Tarquin.] Tarquin</hi> the proud, the seventh and last King of <hi>Rome.</hi> He succeeded <hi>Servius Tullius:</hi> but yet, as my Author sayes, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> was the last good King of <hi>Rome.</hi> If he had been as fortunate as good,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93027:179"/>
he had never married this <hi>Tarquin</hi> to his Daughter <hi>Tullia,</hi> that with his Pride joyned her Cruelty, and exercised it by his hand upon her Father, only that she might be Queen a little before her time. But <hi>Tarquin</hi> was a great Souldier: He conquered the <hi>Latines</hi> and the <hi>Sabines</hi>: He took <hi>Suessa</hi> from the <hi>Hetrusci: Gabii</hi> was delivered to him by his Son <hi>Sextus,</hi> that fled into the Town, pretending himself an Enimy to his Father. He first instituted the <hi>Latine</hi> Feriae. When he built the Capitol, in diging for the foundation, the workmen found a man's <hi>head</hi>: the Soothsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being asked what it signified, answered, a Tower built upon that foundation should be the <hi>head</hi> of the world. At last, when his Son <hi>Sextus</hi> had ravished <hi>Lucrece, I. Brutus</hi> (that fearing his Tyranny had long counterfeited madness) appeared like himself, headed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> against <hi>Tarquin.</hi> He fled to <hi>Porsenna</hi> King of <hi>Hetruria.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish him, <hi>Porsenna</hi> made war against the <hi>Romans,</hi> but in vain, <hi>Liv. Plut.</hi> Yet <hi>Tarquin</hi> once had almost recovered his Crown: for <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Junius Brutus,</hi> undertook to deliver up a Gate of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Sextus Tarquin</hi>: but they were discovered by <hi>Vindicius</hi> a Slave; for which discovery he was made a Freeman: afterwards the Rod laid upon the head of a Slave, when they manumitted or made him free, was called <hi>Vindicta.</hi> But <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> were for this offence put to death by their Father like Slaves, being first whipt, and then beheaded. In the war made by King <hi>Porsenna</hi> in favour of the <hi>Tarquins, Horatius Cocles</hi> stood him and his whole Army, till the Bridge over <hi>Tiber</hi> was broken; then, although he had an Arrow in his thigh, he took the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and swam safely to the <hi>Roman</hi> Host: <hi>Liv. lib</hi> 2. Afterwards, at the election of Magistrates, one jeering him with his lame leg, he answered, <hi>Every one remembers me of my honour.</hi> It was likewise in this war that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93027:179"/>
                  <hi>Mutius Scaevola</hi> having sworn to kill <hi>Porsenna</hi> (then lying with his forces before the City of <hi>Rome</hi>) by mistake slew his Secretary; and being brought before the King, when he saw his error, for anger that his Country was not delivered of <hi>Porsenna</hi> by his hand, he cut it off: <hi>Liv. ibid.</hi> Lastly, in this very war, <hi>Claelia</hi> with divers other Ladies, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test beauties of <hi>Rome,</hi> were given to <hi>Porsenna</hi> for Hostages: but she freed her self and all her Company. For <hi>Claelia,</hi> pretending some Religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies were to be performed by washing in the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> made the Keepers in modesty stand at distance, till the Ladies, following her, swam to the <hi>Romans</hi>: whose Dominions, at that time, reached no further then the River. That <hi>Claelia</hi> went not on foot to the water side, may be collected from the Statue on horse-back, which the <hi>Romans</hi> set up in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her courage in the <hi>Via sacra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 239. <hi>Thersites.] Homer,</hi> with great reason, calls him of all the besiegers of <hi>Troy</hi> the ugliest: he was so, both in body and mind: read his description <hi>Iliad. lib.</hi> 2. For his foul mouth <hi>Achilles</hi> gave him a box on the ear, which silenced the Rogue for ever.</p>
               <p>Verse 340. <hi>Achilles.</hi>] See the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Verse 344. <hi>Asylum.] Rome</hi> was first an Asylum, or Sanctuary for all kinds of Rogues; and the Founder of it, <hi>Romulus,</hi> was a Shepherd, or — <hi>Juvenal</hi> is very loath to goe further, if he should, in reference to the murder of <hi>Remus,</hi> he must call <hi>Romulus</hi> Parracide.</p>

She was redeemed for a great summe of money by <hi>Charaxus</hi> (Brother to <hi>Sapho</hi> the Poetess) that fell in love with <hi>Rhodope</hi>; and after he had spent all the rest of his fortunes upon her, turned Pyrate: but she, raising her self upon the ruins of him and other such fools, came to be so infinite rich, that she built a Pyramid: <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 30 <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>Juvenal</hi> uses her name for a <hi>Roman</hi> Curtezan.</p>

               <p>Verse 79. <hi>Thy Comrade] Cybel's</hi> Priest, that playes upon the Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals till Sack silence him and them: as in the Designe before <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. but then he played to the unthrift <hi>Damasippus,</hi> of whom there was nothing to be got but Sack. Now he playes to wealthy <hi>Virro,</hi> in hope to cozen him out of his estate, as his Predecessors the <hi>Corybantes</hi> cozened <hi>Saturn,</hi> that he should not hear the cry of his own Child: much less shall <hi>Virro</hi> hear the bawling of his man <hi>Naevolus,</hi> but bequeath all to his boon Companion the <hi>Archigallus</hi> or Priest of <hi>Cybel</hi>: See the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Verse 79. <hi>Polypheme.] Polyphemus</hi> the Cyclops, Son to <hi>Neptune</hi> by <hi>Thoosa,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Phorcys.</hi> He was a huge man-monster, and had but one eye, in the midst of his forehead: but his Mother had not so much; for, she and her two Sisters had but one eye amongst them all.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93027:188"/>
He fell in love with the Nymph <hi>Galatea:</hi> and from a steep rock broke the neck of his Favourite <hi>Acis,</hi> because he was jealous that his Mistress loved the Youth better then himself. When <hi>Vlysses</hi> by a storm was cast upon the coast of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he eat up six of his Mates, and would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the rest, if their Captain had not been too subtill for him: but <hi>Vlysses</hi> foxed him with black wine, and when he was in a dead sleep, got a fire-stick and burned out his one eye: <hi>Homer</hi> 10. <hi>Odyss. Virg. Aeneid.</hi> 3. Many say <hi>Polyphemus</hi> had but one eye, some that he had two, others three; but 'tis all fabulous. For he was a prudent man, and therefore said to have an eye in his head neer his brains. But <hi>Vlysses</hi> was wiser then he, by whom he was said to be blinded, that is, over-reached: <hi>Serv.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 104. <hi>Our Records</hi>] The names of Fathers that had Children were recorded in the Aerarium or Chequer-Office. The original of this Inrollment was from <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> that to ascertain the number of Births and Burials, ordered that when a child was born, the kindred of the child should bring a piece of money into the Aerarium of <hi>Juno Lucina;</hi> and so likewise into the Exchequer of <hi>Venus Libitina</hi> when any died or came to age. This Custome, quite abolished, was revived by <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> at the birth of children: <hi>Lips. in Tacit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 109. <hi>Heir</hi>] A <hi>Roman</hi> could not be Heir to his Wife unless he had a Child by her. And whereas Bachellors were fined for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Marriage: Fathers had right to stand for civil Magistracy, to cast lots for Provinces, and to be Heirs by VVill. <hi>Tacit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 110. <hi>Caducum.] Caducum,</hi> by <hi>Cujacius</hi> out of <hi>Vlpian,</hi> is defined to be that which is left to a person by Law capable to receive, but yet for some respects devolves from him to the Exchequer after the Testators death. Of this there were two sorts: The one, when the gift to an Heir
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93027:189"/>
or Legatee (that died before the Testator, or opening of the Will) came to the Prince. This was enacted by the Law <hi>Papia Popaea</hi> (made to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> with money, the publick Coffers being exhausted by the Civil Wars) and abrogated by <hi>Justinian: Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cod. Justin. Tit.</hi> 1. The other sort was when the Prince had by the Law <hi>Julia</hi> and <hi>Popaea</hi> that which was left by VVill to such as were unmarried, if they did not marry within ten dayes after the Testators death: And half that was so conferred to such as was married, but had no Children, in case the man was 25 years of age, or the woman 20, except it was given by their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, which <hi>Cujacius</hi> thinks extended to the sixt degree. This Law was repealed by <hi>Constantinus, Constantius</hi> and <hi>Constans: lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Cod. Justin. Tit.</hi> 58. And to this the Poet here hath reference. The Servant telling his Master, amongst other good turns he had done him, that by him he was put in a condition to receive.</p>

                  <l>—Nec non &amp; dulce Caducum.</l>

               </q>
               <p>Verse 112. <hi>Three] Jus trium liberorum,</hi> The Law of three Children freed a man from being Ward, gave him precedency in election to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Common-wealth, trebbled his measure of Corn in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick allowance: this <hi>Pliny</hi> the Consul obtained of the Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> for his friend <hi>Tacitus: Plin. Epist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 126. <hi>The Court of</hi> Mars.] The <hi>Areopagus;</hi> where those severest and most just Judges the <hi>Areopagites</hi> gave sentence, and delivered their votes in Characters and alphabeticall Letters, θ <hi>theta</hi> signifying the Sentence of death: and death it was to divulge the Votes by which that Sentence passed. Some say it was called the Court of <hi>Mars,</hi> because <hi>Neptune</hi> in that Court accused <hi>Mars</hi> for the murder of his Son: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93027:189"/>
he was acquited by seven Votes of the twelve Gods that were his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: <hi>Alexand. ab Alexand. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 5. The first Judgement of life and death was pronounced in the <hi>Areopagus</hi>: Plin. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>See</hi> Jul. Pollux. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de magist. Athen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 127. <hi>O fool! fool!] Juvenal</hi>'s expression is, <hi>O Corydon! Corydon!</hi> so the <hi>Romans</hi> called any dull Country-Lob.</p>
               <p>Verse 145. <hi>Laufella.</hi>] The good Goddess was well served when the Offering was made by <hi>Laufella,</hi> one of whose abhominable drunken Pranks you hear of in <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. This Oblation was made for the People: <hi>Credat aliquis, &amp;c.</hi> Some may believe that bribes were given to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es before whom <hi>Clodius</hi> was arraigned, for the Adultery which cleerely he had committed with <hi>Caesars</hi> wife, wherein he violated the religion of that Sacrifice which they say is made for the People: At the celebration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Men are so far from being admitted, that the very Pictures of male creatures are covered. <hi>Senec. Epist.</hi> 98.</p>

               <p>Verse 176. <hi>Fabricius,</hi>] The Censor: <hi>Sat.</hi> 11.

For he fined him because he found in his house illegall Plate, <hi>viz.</hi> a silver-Vessel of ten pound weight: See the end of the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Verse 177 <hi>Hackney</hi>-Maesians,] Chair bearers of <hi>Maesia,</hi> which the vanity of poor <hi>Naevolus</hi> wishes for, that he might be carried in state to see the Chariot-races, Stage-playes, and other recreations of the Circus.</p>
               <p>Verse 184. <hi>Vlysses,</hi>] King of the Isles of <hi>Ithaca</hi> and <hi>Dulichium,</hi> Son to <hi>Laertes</hi> and <hi>Anticlea;</hi> but some said his true Father was the Outlaw <hi>Sisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> that met with his Mother as she went to be married with <hi>Laertes;</hi> or
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93027:190"/>
as others tell the story, forced her after marriage, in her journey to the Oracle. <hi>Ajax</hi> in his Plea objects this against <hi>Vlysses</hi>: Ovid. <hi>lib.</hi> 13. <hi>Met.</hi> jeering him with his <hi>Sisyphian</hi> blood. <hi>Homer</hi> makes him a person of great prudence and experience. He married <hi>Penelope</hi> Daughter to <hi>Icarus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian.</hi> By her he had <hi>Telemachus,</hi> and so doated on her, that when the <hi>Greek</hi> Princes engaged in the war against <hi>Troy,</hi> he counterfeited madness, hoping they would leave him with her, as useless for them. Therefore yoaking Beasts of different species, he plowed the Sea-shoar, and sowed the sands with Salt. But <hi>Palamedes,</hi> to make tryall whether <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses</hi> were really mad or no, laid <hi>Telemachus</hi> in the furrow before him, which he seeing, took off the Plough and balked his Child. Thus he was drawn into the Association, where he served his Country with great judgement and success. When <hi>Achilles</hi> passed for a Maid of honour in the Court of King <hi>Lycomedes, Vlysses</hi> found him out; parted him and Princess <hi>Deidemia,</hi> and brought him to a nobler Mistress, the VVarre: many services he did of the like nature, for without them the Oracle had pronounced, that <hi>Troy</hi> could not be taken. He flattered <hi>Philoctetes</hi> to a disovery of the poysoned arrowes of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and brought him to the Leaguer before <hi>Troy.</hi> He stole away the ashes of King <hi>Laomedon</hi> that were kept in the Town on the top of the <hi>Scaean-Port.</hi> He with the help of <hi>Diomedes</hi> slew the Guard, and carried away the Palladium, the Image of <hi>Pallas,</hi> being the Telesmaticall Safeguard of <hi>Troy.</hi> He was sent again with <hi>Diomedes</hi> as a Spie into <hi>Thrace,</hi> where he killed the King, and brought away his horses, before the Grooms watered them in the River <hi>Xanthus.</hi> About victualling the Camp he had strange fallings out with <hi>Palamedes,</hi> and at last, upon the credit of a false report raised by himself, he got his old discoverer stoned to death. VVhen <hi>Achilles</hi> was slain, in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93027:190"/>
for hearing and determining the right to his Armes, both he and <hi>Ajax</hi> pleading their own Causes, Sentence passed for <hi>Vlysses.</hi> When <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, he slew <hi>Orsilochus</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Creet,</hi> that would have abridged him of his just share in the plunder of the Town. He put to death <hi>Polyxena</hi> at the Tomb of <hi>Achilles</hi>; and when he took shipping for <hi>Ithaca,</hi> made the Keepers of <hi>Astyanax</hi> (Son to <hi>Hector</hi>) breake the Child's neck from the top of a Tower. But a Voyage so bloodily begun must needs be improsperous. After some crosses at Sea, he was cast by a storm upon the coast of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where with twelve of his men he entred the Den of <hi>Polyphemus</hi>; and when that <hi>Cyclops</hi> had devoured six of them, <hi>Vlysses</hi> burning out his eye as aforesaid, he and the rest, wrapped in Ram-skins, escaped. Then landing in <hi>Aeolia, Aeolus</hi> gave him a Wind in a bag: but when it had carried him within ken of <hi>Ithaca</hi>; his Mates, taking it to be a bag of Gold, opened it, and the VVind that came out drive him back again into <hi>Aeolia.</hi> From thence he passed to the <hi>Laestry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi> or <hi>Canibals</hi> that eat men, and so to <hi>Circe</hi> that transformed his men into beasts: but <hi>Mercury</hi> gave him a counter-spell, and confiding in the virtue of it, he boldly came up to <hi>Circe,</hi> drew his sword, and forced her to restore his Mates to their own shapes. Then, captivated with <hi>Circe's</hi> beauty, he staid with her a whole year, and had by her a Son named <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legonus. Hesiod</hi> affirmes that she brought him other two, <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus.</hi> At last, with much unwillingness, she dismissed him. After per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of certain ceremonies he went down into <hi>Elysium,</hi> and there from the mouth of his Mother <hi>Anticlea,</hi> and from <hi>Elpenor,</hi> and the blind Prophet <hi>Teresias,</hi> was instructed in future events. Returning again into this world, and to his Mistress <hi>Circe,</hi> he gave the rites of buriall to the body of <hi>Elpenor,</hi> that in his drink had fallen from a Ladder and broke his
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:93027:191"/>
neck. Afterwards he sailed by the Isle of the Syrens, and for fear their sweet singing might inchant his men, he appointed them to stop their ears with wax, and commanded that he himself should be tyed to the main Mast: So with much difficulty passing the Straights of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> that set their Barking Dogs upon him, he arrived in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ethusa</hi> and <hi>Lampetia,</hi> Daughters to <hi>Phoebus,</hi> kept their Fathers Flocks, which he charged his men not to meddle with. But whilst he slept; his Mates, compelled by hunger and perswaded by <hi>Eurylochus,</hi> killed a great sort of the sheep; for which they paid their lives in a wrack at Sea, not a man in the Ship escaping but only <hi>Vlysses</hi>; that, bestrid a Mast, and was by the winde and waves for nine dayes together tossed to and fro: at length, being cast upon the Isle of <hi>Ogygia,</hi> the Nymph <hi>Calypso</hi> gave him kinde reception: seven years he staid with her, in which time she had two Sons by him, <hi>Nausithous</hi> and <hi>Nausinous: Hesiod.</hi> Into <hi>Ogygia Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> sent <hi>Mercury</hi> to tell the Goddess <hi>Calypso,</hi> that she must no longer detain <hi>Vlysses.</hi> Once again he put to Sea, but when he was in sight of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> inhabited by the <hi>Phaeacks, Neptune</hi> raised a storm that split his Ship; and he had perished, if <hi>Leucothoe</hi> in pitty had not helped him to a Plank, which he held by, till he came safe to shoar in one of the <hi>Phaeack Havens.</hi> There he hid his nakedness amongst the bushes, but was found out and cloathed by <hi>Nausica,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Alcinous</hi> King of that Island; where, by the artifice of <hi>Pallas,</hi> he was brought to Queen <hi>Arete</hi> that gave him a Ship manned for service. The Master landed him in <hi>Ithaca,</hi> and not being able to wake him according, to his Commission, laid a great deal of treasure by him, and left him in a dead sleep: but <hi>Pallas</hi> quickly roused him, and put him into a beggers habit. In that pickle he came to his Neat-herds, and found his Son <hi>Telemachus</hi> amongst
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:93027:191"/>
them. In this disguise he was brought to his house by his Hogherd <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus,</hi> where, after many affronts put upon him by his Wife's impudent Suiters, his Nurse <hi>Euriclea</hi> knew him. Lastly, his Son <hi>Telemachus</hi> and two of his Neat-heards assisting, he fell upon the pretenders to <hi>Penelope,</hi> slew them all, and then discovered himself to her. But forewarned by the Oracle that his Son should kill him, he resolved to leave his Court and lurk in the Woods: mean time <hi>Telegonus,</hi> his Son by <hi>Circe,</hi> desirous to see his Father, made a voyage to <hi>Ithaca</hi>: but being a stranger to the Servants of <hi>Vlysses,</hi> most uncivilly they would have shut the gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him and his followers, that disputed their entrance; in the tumult by meer chance <hi>Telegonus</hi> shot his Father with a poisoned arrow, dipt in the blood of the Fish <hi>Trygon.</hi>

Isles. The <hi>Romans</hi> named them <hi>Gades:</hi> both are now one Island, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Caliz</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and <hi>Cales</hi> by the <hi>English,</hi> that had power within the memory of man to have given it what name they pleased: for in the year 1596 this Isle was taken, and the City sackt by the Earles of <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> Knight, sent thither with a Fleet to revenge the <hi>Spaniards</hi> invasion of <hi>England</hi> in 88. In this Isle the grass is so rank, that Cows milk will make no Cheese, nor come to curds, unless it be diluted with a great deal of water. It is likewise cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly reported, that Cattle which Graziers feed there, if they bleed them not within 30 dayes, will be sure to die of fat. This was the reason why the Poets invented their Fables of <hi>Geryon's</hi> Droves taken by <hi>Hercules,</hi> that once had a Temple in this Isle; wherein are now two old Castles, called <hi>Torres de Hercules. See</hi> Strab. <hi>lib.</hi> 3.</p>

The Springs that contribute to <hi>Ganges</hi> are not known, but 30 Rivers flow into it. It is 8000 paces over where it is narrowest, where it is broadest 20000, and where it is shallowest 100 foot deep. It had the name from <hi>Ganges</hi> King of <hi>Aethiopia. Suid.</hi>

out of his hand; nor was able, when he stood still, to remove his foot. Yet presuming too much upon his strength, he would needs try if he could rend in sunder a tree, which age or accident had cleft as it grew in the Forest: at first it yielded to his violence, but presently closed again, and catching his hands in a trap, held him till the Wolves devoured him. <hi>Cic. Val. Max.</hi>

               <p>Verse 17. <hi>Longinus.] C. Cassius Longinus,</hi> the great Civil Lawyer, to whom <hi>Caligula</hi> married <hi>Drusilla. Nero</hi> commanded his eyes to be put out, and then gave him but an hour to prepare for death. His pretended Crime was, for having in his Bed-chamber the Image of <hi>Cassius,</hi> one of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>'s Assassinates: but that which really made him a Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent was his wealth.</p>
               <p>Verse 19. <hi>Seneca.</hi>] See the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 5. This most learned and good man, after the death of <hi>Burrhus,</hi> was criminated by <hi>Foenius Ruffus</hi> and <hi>Tigillinus,</hi> for improving his fortunes beyond the limits of a private person: and they likewise informed, that in the sweetness of his Gardens and magnificence of his Villaes he exceeded the Prince himself.

               <p>Verse 35. <hi>One o'th' Sages.] Democritus</hi> of <hi>Abdera,</hi> the laughing Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, that being asked why he did nothing but laugh, answered, he could not help it, having for his Object Man, full of Ignorance; that does and does, and nothing does he doe: all his designes clearly proving, that he never comes to the years of discretion; but growing a Childe again, kills himself with superfluous care and toil. But sorrow never came neer his cheerfull heart, otherwise he would not have lived to be a hundred and nine years old. His opinion was, That all things are composed of Atomes, and that there are many VVorlds and all corruptible. From the <hi>Magi, Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> he learned Astrology and Theology. He was so great a Philosopher, that he was called <hi>Pentathlos, viz.</hi> a Champion at five Exercises; Naturals, Morals, Mathematicks, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall Sciences, and all the Arts. To attain his knowledge he travelled, and so spent all the wealth left him by his Father, a man so rich that he feasted <hi>Xerxes</hi> and his whole Army. After his return to <hi>Abdera,</hi> he lived in very great poverty in a Garden house, neer the walls of the Town; where, resolving to spend the rest of his life in Contemplation, he burned out his sight with the reflection of the Sun from a brass Bason. <hi>Laert.</hi>

               <p>Verse 36. <hi>Th' other wept.] Heraclitus</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the weeping Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, that is said never to have gone over his threshold into the street with dry eyes. For, as <hi>Democritus</hi> alwayes laughed, because he believed all our actions to be folly: so <hi>Heraclitus</hi> ever wept, because he thought them to be misery. In his old age he fell into a dropsie, and slighting

the Physitians Art, which he said could never make a moist part dry, he cased himself in Cows dung, but whilst he lay drying in the Sun, he fell asleep, and Dogs tore out his throat. Some say he was never taught, but came to all his learning by nature and industry: others say he heard <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates,</hi> and <hi>Hippasus</hi> the Pythagorian. He flourished in the time of the last <hi>Darius.</hi> He left many Poems; and is often quoted by <hi>Aristotle</hi>: his Philosophical Works were very obscure, which gave him the title of the Dark Philosopher.</p>
               <p>Verse 40. <hi>Praetexta.</hi>] Read the original and description of this Gown in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 5. I shall only adde, that in the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Priests likewise wore it, with the same priviledge wherewith some Christian Orders weare their habits at this day: for, till it was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off, Sentence of condemnation could not pass against the Priests.</p>
               <p>Verse 40. <hi>Trabeae.</hi>] The Trabeae were of three sorts, the first a Gown woven all of Purple, and consecrated to the Gods: such was the Robe before mentioned, <hi>viz. Jove</hi>'s Gown. The second was the Robe Royall here named, worn by Kings and Consuls, made of Purple interwoven with White. The third was the Augure's habit, Scarlet woven with Purple: <hi>Serv. Aen. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Alexand. ab. Alex. Gen Dier. lib.</hi> 5 <hi>cap.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Verse 41. <hi>High Throne.</hi>] My Author here describes the Consul, and likewise calls him Praetor, because in his absence the Praetor, that set forth the Circensian Playes, sate mounted up as Lord of the Circus: <hi>Sat.</hi> 11.
<q>
                     <l>—Great <hi>Cybel's</hi> Towell is hung out;</l>
                     <l>And to her solemn Playes the Town's devout:</l>
                     <l>Where that great Horse-stealer, the Praetor, sits</l>
                     <l>As if he triumpht.—</l>
                  </q>
But now the Consul takes his place, and comes into the Circus in the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93027:207"/>
State and Habiliments of a King, as appears by his Ushers with the Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Ensignes of death, and by his Trabea, Crown, and Scepter headed with the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle carved in Ivory. For the perfecting of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, I place him in a Throne not a Tribunal, because he could not use his Chariot-Chair in the Circus as a Judgement Seat, but as a Chair of State, whereon he might sit to behold the Gladiators, as you see him fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in the Designe before <hi>Sat.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Verse 45. <hi>Atlas.</hi>] When the Consul, in this Mock-triumph, was no longer able to bear that Celestial Orbe of his massy Crown, he had an <hi>Atlas</hi> to support it, a Slave, that having taken the Crown, seemed to be as great a man as his Master. <hi>Triumphanti, &amp;c.</hi> when a <hi>Hetruscan</hi> Crown of Gold was held behinde the back of him that triumphed, and yet wore an Iron Ring upon his finger: the Conqueror and the Slave that bore the Crown, were equals in their fortunes. <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 33. In these sports it was the Slaves office to cry aloud to the Consul, Look behind you Sir, Remember you are a man.</p>
               <p>Verse 52. <hi>Almes-Basket.</hi>] The Consul's two Sportulaes, the meat and Money-basket which obliged the attendance of his Clients in white Robes not as <hi>Candidati</hi> (for 'twas long before this time that suiters to the People stood in white) but as men of eminence and imployment in the Empire, as if they were principal Secretaries to a King. <hi>Fenest. de Mag.

               <p>Verse 56. <hi>Dull climes.] Abdera,</hi> where <hi>Democritus</hi> was born, stood in the Barbarous Country of <hi>Thrace.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Verse 66. <hi>Statues.</hi>] If a man were condemned for Tyranny, Treason, or any Crime of the like nature, his name was crost out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Calendar or Records, and his Statues broken. This was done either by Decree of Senate, or by the fury of the People. See <hi>Tacit. Annal.</hi> 6. and <hi>Plin.</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 71. <hi>Great</hi> Sejanus.] <hi>Aelius Sejanus,</hi> Son to <hi>Seius Strabo.</hi> In his youth he followed <hi>C. Caesar,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Augustus.</hi> By many artifices he wrought upon <hi>Tiberius,</hi> so as that subtile Prince, closs to all others, lay open to him. He had a strong body and a confident spirit; secret in his own actings; an Informer against others; equally proud and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; seemingly modest; really ambitious; to which end he sometimes made use of bounty, but most commonly of industry and circumspection, mediums alike dangerous, when a Crown is the Designe. At his first coming to be Captain of the Emperor's Life-guard, the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Cohort, his forces were not considerable; but he made them so, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Praetorians</hi> (that were before quartered severally, and as he said grew debosht) into a body, and fixing them in a standing Camp, that they might be ready to act when they received his Orders; and that a view of their number and strength, might beget confidence in them, fear in others. He had no sooner intrenched, but he crept into the hearts of the Souldiers, with going to them, calling them by their names, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them hopes of preferment, he being commissioned to name his own Officers. He likewise omitted not, either to court the Senate, or to advance his friends to honours and offices; which <hi>Tiberius</hi> was so far from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:93027:208"/>
that in the Senate-house he commended <hi>Sejanus</hi> as his laborious Partner, gave him the second place in the Empire by making him his own perpetual Collegue, and suffered his Images to be set up in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters and publick Meeting-places, and to be carried in the Ensignes of the Legions. But the Master-piece of his policy was, to ingratiate himself with <hi>Livia,</hi> wife to <hi>Drusus</hi> heir apparent to the Empire. This Lady, Sister to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> was very ill favoured when she was a Girle, afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a beauty: nothing was unhandsome in her but her heart, of which she robbed her husband, to bestow it upon her servant; and left a noble certainty for a base hope, that is, to be Empress to <hi>Sejanus</hi>; when the skie should fall, and he trample upon all <hi>Caesar</hi>'s numerous Relations. Yet <hi>Livia</hi> in some particulars like to <hi>Hippia. Sat.</hi> 6.

and prostituted, together with her self, the other Chamber-secrets of her Lord, that in private often said, It seems <hi>Caesar</hi> hath a Co-adjutor whilst his Son is living: this was a dash upon the mouth with his tongue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Sejanus</hi> was more sensible, then of the other given him by <hi>Drusus</hi> with his hand, which he returned with a speeding revenge. For he put away his wife <hi>Apicata,</hi> to make way for <hi>Livia</hi>: and she to requite him, poysoned her husband <hi>Tacit. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Tiberius</hi> being then at Capreae, had intelligence of all his practices, and by his death prevented his own murder.

the Tribunes and their Souldiers encompassed and bound him; then Sentence passing in the House, they dragg'd him to the <hi>Gemoniae,</hi> where he was flung down. <hi>Dion. Cass.</hi> The ignominious manner of his execution, how his Statues were pulled down, and dragged through the Streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> I need not add; you have an exact description of it in this Satyr.</p>
               <p>Verse 74. <hi>Laurell.</hi>] Upon great feast dayes, the <hi>Romans</hi> drest up their houses with boughs and wreaths of Laurell: and what day should they keep more holy, then <hi>Caesar</hi>'s day of deliverance from <hi>Sejanus?</hi> therefore they incourage one another to sacrifice unto <hi>Jupiter Capitoline</hi> a Bull, as white as he himself was, when he carried <hi>Europa</hi> upon his back. And this Bull was to be haled with ropes through the streets of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol: as the body of <hi>Sejanus</hi> was dragged, with hooks, thrust into his throat to the <hi>Scalae Gemoniae, the Gemonian Stairs,</hi> where malefactors had their thigh-bones broken, and were then burned to ashes. <hi>Coel.

               <p>Verse 82. <hi>Capreae,</hi>] An Isle about 8 miles beyond the City of <hi>Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> in <hi>Campania.</hi> Nothing in this Isle could invite <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Solitude, or that he might the freelier enjoy <hi>Thrasillus</hi> and the rest of his <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Astrologers; unless his Majesty had loved Quales, wherewith the place abounds.</p>
               <p>Verse 86. <hi>Nurtia.</hi>] The Goddess of <hi>Thuscany,</hi> where <hi>Sejanus</hi> was born, at <hi>Volscinium,</hi> now <hi>Bolsena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 89. <hi>Selling of our voice.</hi>] Before the Sovereign power was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in the <hi>Caesars,</hi> when the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was governed by the Senate and the People: the poorer sort lived upon the sale of their Votes to such as were Candidates, or Suiters to them for publick Offices and imployment.</p>

                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:93027:209"/>Verse 98. <hi>Brutidius.</hi>] A Senator, that looked pale for fear some Spies, which were in the Senate-house at the condemnation of <hi>Sejanus,</hi> might criminate all such as spake not thundring words against that Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. For, my Author conceives that upon such information <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> would not spare his own Party, but misplace the execution of his fury, as <hi>Ajax</hi> did, that beat a heard of Oxen, supposing them to be the <hi>Grecians</hi> that gave sentence against him, when he pleaded his title to the armes of <hi>Achilles.

                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:93027:214"/>
he was a man that studied Astronomy, especially that part which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the nature of the Windes, for the benefit of Navigation. He therefore divined, when the Sun was coming into <hi>Taurus,</hi> if there would be a Storm at Sea or a Calme, and what day or hour of the day, or how long, the West wind should breathe, or what other winde should rise at the rising of the Dogge or any Celestiall Signe, and blow again upon Criticall dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> the fifth, the seventh day, and the like. For this reason he was thought to be King of the Winds. To which is added by <hi>Strab. lib.</hi> 1. that he guessed at the Windes by the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; and Marriners finding it to be true, believed the VVinds to be his Subjects, and that he could at his pleasure imprison or release them: an opinion more probable then that of some <hi>Lapland</hi>-Philosophers, that tell us, if we have the skin of a Dolphin, ordered with certain ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, we shall have a wind to any place we are bound for, and no other wind shall blow upon the water. Sure <hi>Homer</hi>'s Age was poisoned with this natural Philosophy, otherwise he would not have made <hi>Aeolus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a wind in a bag upon <hi>Vlysses,</hi> as aforesaid. <hi>Aeolus,</hi> as to Morality, is a wise man, that moderates his passions seasonably: and, according to the opportunity of time and business, speaks angrily when he is pleased, and gently when he is offended: such a one, at his pleasure, bridles and lets loose the wind. <hi>N.

this ignominious death, if in the time of my prosperity I had thus remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <hi>Solon,</hi> that when I shewed him all my wealth, would not pronounce me happy, but said, No Judgement could be made of any mans felicity till the hour of his death. This Answere struck a terror into the great <hi>Persian</hi> King; having then before his eyes the truth of <hi>Solon</hi>'s words in the fortune of a mighty Prince, and not knowing how soon it might come to be his own case; <hi>Cyrus</hi> therefore pardoned <hi>Croesus,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards used his advise in the quality of a privy-Counsellor. <hi>Herod. lib.</hi> 1.

The 24. He plundered the Isle of <hi>Cos,</hi> and put the King and Queen to the sword, as in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 10. The 25. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the <hi>Amazons,</hi> and gave their Queen <hi>Hippolyte</hi> to his friend and fellow Souldier <hi>Theseus.</hi> The 26. He went down to Hell, and brought up their Porter, three-headed <hi>Cerberus</hi> in a tripple chain. The 27. He brought back with him into the world Queen <hi>Alcestis,</hi> that died for her Husband, as in the end of the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. The 28. After his return from hell, he slew <hi>Lycus</hi> King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that in his absence would have ravished his wife <hi>Megara.</hi> The 29. with his arrows he shot the Eagle, which upon the top of the Mountain <hi>Caucasus</hi> fed upon the still growing liver of <hi>Prometheus.</hi> The 30.

upon their Tombe erected two Pillars. The 35. He passed the torrid Zone, and the burning Sands of <hi>Libya,</hi> not troubled with their scorching heat: and having lost his Ship, waded through the quick-sands of the <hi>Syrtes.</hi> The 36. He set up the Pillars in the West, called <hi>Hercules</hi> Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. The 37. He slew <hi>Eurytus</hi> King of <hi>Oechalia,</hi> and plundered the City, carrying into <hi>Eubaea</hi> the fair Princess <hi>Iole</hi> promised to him, and afterwards denyed by her Father. When <hi>Deianira</hi> heard of his love to <hi>Iole,</hi> she remembred the message delivered to her from the <hi>Centaur Nes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> together with the Vest dipped in his blood, <hi>viz.</hi> That if ever she found her Husband loved another, she should give him that Vest; and when he had it on, he should be only hers. She therefore sent it to him by her servant <hi>Lychas,</hi> which he puting on as he went to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it set him in such a frenzy, that he made himself the burnt-Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. After his death he was held a God, and believed to be the same with the Sun. <hi>Macrob. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Saturn. cap.</hi> 2. In his return from <hi>Spain,</hi> some think he brought the use of Letters into <hi>Italy,</hi> and was therefore worshipped both in a Temple apart, and also with the Muses.</p>
               <p>Verse 428. <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi>] The last King of <hi>Syria,</hi> from <hi>Ninus</hi> the thirtith. His Lievtenant General <hi>Arbactus,</hi> being ambitious, after some great service, to see his Master (a favour never before granted to any but meniall Servants) after long suit was admitted, and in the first Modell of a <hi>Seraglio</hi> he found the King, not distinguishable from the Concubines, either in his habit or imployment; for he was spinning purple-silk: only his body seemed to be the tenderest, his eyes and his garb the most las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious. At sight hereof <hi>Arbactus,</hi> with horrid indignation, stomacked that so many men should be governed by a VVoman; that so many men, which knew the use of armes, should be subject to a Distaffe. At his
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:93027:224"/>
return to the Armie, <hi>Arbactus</hi> reported the strange spectacle, professing, he would never serve a Prince that had rather be a Woman then a Man. All are of his mind. They march against <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that in his last scene was still the same; for he stood not upon his defence like a man, but hid himself like a woman; not having in his thoughts the hope of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Kingdome, but the fear of loosing his life. At last, with some few disorderly Servants he takes the field, is beaten, retreats to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, layes himself and all his treasure upon a pile of wood, and made it be fired; doing only this act like a man. <hi>Justin lib.</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erse 1. <hi>Corvinus,</hi>] The Friend to whom <hi>Juvenal</hi> writes this Satyr.</p>
               <p>Verse 4. <hi>Juno.</hi>] In the Capitol was the Temple of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to which joyned the Temples of <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> under one roof, cast into the figure of an Eagle, that with his body covered <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Temple, and spread his wings over <hi>Juno's</hi> and <hi>Minerva's.</hi> To these, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principal of the selected Gods, milk-white beasts were sacrificed; Bulls to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Cowes to <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Minerva. Juvenal,</hi> bounding his devotions within the limits of his fortunes, goes not to the Capitol to pay his vow (for his friend's safe arrival) to these three <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Deities; but building Altars of green Turfe, offers milk-white Sacrifices to them all; to <hi>Juno</hi> an Ewe-lamb, another to <hi>Minerva,</hi> to <hi>Jupiter</hi> a young Bullock, wishing him a Bull; as fat as Madam <hi>Hispulla,</hi> that fell in love with the Tragedian. <hi>Sat.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Verse 6. <hi>The</hi> Mauritanian Gorgon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] The <hi>Gorgons; Medusa, Sthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> and <hi>Euryale,</hi> were Daughters to <hi>Phorcus</hi> and <hi>Cete.</hi> They had the Isles of the <hi>Dorcades</hi> in the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Ocean, right against the Orchard of the <hi>Hesperides.</hi> They were Martiall Ladies (neer the Mountain <hi>Atlas</hi> upon the borders of <hi>Mauritania</hi>) conquered by <hi>Minerva,</hi> or <hi>Perseus,</hi> that slew their Queen <hi>Medusa. Xenoph. Herod. Minerva</hi> is fabled to bear in her Shield <hi>Medusa's</hi> head, that turns men into stones, because
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:93027:245"/>
wisdome petrefies the hearts of men, making them constant and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as Rocks.</p>
               <p>Verse 10. <hi>Besprinkling Wine.</hi>] The grand Sacrifices are imitated by <hi>Juvenal</hi> both in colour and ceremony, for he sprinkles wine between the Bullocks horns: Queen <hi>Dido</hi> did no more, when she offered a white Cow to <hi>Juno,</hi> as you may see <hi>Aeneid. lib.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Verse 17. <hi>Clitumnus,</hi>] A River that divides <hi>Vmbria</hi> and <hi>Tuscany. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largyr.</hi> whose water gives such virtue to the rich pastures adjoyning, that all the Cows grazing there have white Calves. Therefore the Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Sacrifices came from thence. <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Propert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 18. <hi>Arch-flamen.</hi>] The ordinary Minister that struck down the beast sacrificed, was called <hi>Popa</hi>: but <hi>Juvenal,</hi> upon his Thanksgiving day, would have had an Officer of better quality, some Flamen or Arch-flamen, in case his fortunes had been no less then his friend-ship to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus,</hi> the Merchant.</p>
               <p>Verse 33. <hi>Isis.</hi>] The Temple of <hi>Isis</hi> notorious, first for superstition, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the pennance which the great Lady is ready to perform, if it be white <hi>Io's</hi> pleasure. <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. secondly for lust. <hi>Sat.</hi> 9. is famous in the third place, for pictures of wracks at Sea, vowed and dedicated to the Goddess <hi>Isis.</hi> One would have thought the <hi>Romans</hi> had choise of Gods enow of their own: yet, it seems, they thought not so; when in their dangers at Sea, they made so many vowes to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Goddess <hi>Isis,</hi> as imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a whole company of Picture-drawers only to draw votive Tables, that were to be hung up in her Temple.</p>
               <p>Verse 48. <hi>Baetick aire.</hi>] In Baetick <hi>Spain</hi> (now <hi>Granada</hi>) is a pasture where the aire and water give a naturall tincture to the sheeps Fleeces, dying the wool upon their backs of a colour between black and red.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:93027:246"/>Verse 50. <hi>Parthenius,</hi>] A <hi>Grecian,</hi> a great Master in the art of graving.</p>
               <p>Verse 52. <hi>Pholus,</hi>] A notorius drunken <hi>Centaur. Theocr.</hi> When he treated <hi>Hercules,</hi> he brought out a tunne of wine, which he had buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the sand; and being pierced, it cast a perfume upon the aire, which his neighbour-<hi>Centaurs</hi> presently sented; and would have stormed the place, if it had not been defended by <hi>Hercules,</hi> that killed many of the Assailants, and made the rest take their heels. <hi>Diod. lib.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Verse 52. Fuscus <hi>his Wife.</hi>] She might have been <hi>Pholus</hi> his Wife, if she could drink between 2 and 3 gallons at once.</p>
               <p>Verse 53. <hi>Baskets.</hi>] All the merchandize <hi>Great Britain</hi> afforded in my Author's time; and so great a rarity the <hi>Romans</hi> thought them, that they made our <hi>British</hi> word <hi>Latin,</hi> calling them <hi>Bascaudae</hi>; nay, they were angry that any but themselves should be said to have found out the Art of making Baskets. <hi>Mart. lib.</hi> 14.</p>

                  <l>From <hi>British Picts</hi> the barb'rous Baskets came,</l>
                  <l>But now <hi>Rome</hi> would gladly th' invention claim.</l>

                     <l>—beat down City gates,</l>
                     <l>And foil'd with gifts his rival-States.</l>
                  </q>
The particular, here instanced by my Author, is the bargain which King <hi>Philip</hi> made with <hi>Lasthenes</hi> and <hi>Eurycrates</hi> for the rendition of <hi>Olynth</hi>; a City of <hi>Thrace</hi> neer to <hi>Athos,</hi> then under the Command of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; not to be taken either by a storm or siege, but only by that which K. <hi>Philip</hi> said would enter the strongest Fortification, an Asse loaded with

Gold. At this time his Gold was laid out upon Merchandize, for it brought him in thrice as much in Plate.</p>

               <p>Verse 82. <hi>Alban Mountain,</hi>] Where <hi>Ascanius</hi> built the City of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Longa,</hi> leaving the Town of <hi>Lavinium</hi> to his Step-mother <hi>Lavinia.</hi> That <hi>Alba</hi> was so named from the white Sow with thirty Pigs sucking her, <hi>vid.

               </p>
               <p>Verse 88. <hi>Tyrrhene Pharos,</hi>] The Port of <hi>Hostia</hi> (anciently <hi>Ostia</hi>) where <hi>Tiber</hi> disburdens it self into the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea. <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Pharos</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> built the stony Armes of this Port: and for eleven years together kept 30000 men at work upon it. <hi>Sueton.</hi> It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by <hi>Augustus,</hi> and repaired by <hi>Trajan.</hi> See <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <hi>Panegyrick.</hi>

               <p>Verse 94. Baian <hi>Lighters,</hi>] Boats that came from <hi>Baiae,</hi> described in the beginning of <hi>Sat.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Verse 95. <hi>Shav'd Saylors.</hi>] It was the custome for <hi>Roman</hi> Slaves, when they received their freedom, to shave their heads before they put on their Hats: those which, at the triall for their lives, were acquitted did the like, shewing themselves to <hi>Jupiter</hi> with their crowns shav'd: and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Saylors, after they had escaped a shipwrack, used the same ceremony.</p>
               <p>Verse 97. <hi>Speak and think.</hi>] The <hi>Romans</hi> thought that any man's good Omen consisted in other mens words and wishes: <hi>Omen</hi> being only the conjunction of <hi>Os</hi> and <hi>Mens, tongue</hi> and <hi>heart.</hi> Of the solemn form of Sacrifices used for good Omens sake.

               <p>Verse 115. <hi>Paccius.</hi>] A rich childless man, presented by all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Heredipetae or Legacy-mongers. He is named by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that calls him <hi>African. lib.</hi> 20.</p>

               <p>Verse 118. <hi>Promise Hecatombes.</hi>] For the recovery of sick men (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they were rich and childless) flattering knaves, that hoped for great Legacies, would not stick to vow to the Gods Hecatombes of Elephants, if they were to be had; which was impossible: for they were beasts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen by the <hi>Romans,</hi> till invaded by those dreadfull enemies, <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> King of the <hi>Molossian Epirots</hi> (whose Souldiers rid upon their backs in wooden Towers) and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>; here called <hi>Tyrian,</hi> because Queen <hi>Dido,</hi> the Foundress of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> came from <hi>Tyre.</hi> Nor in my Author's time were any Elephants fed or kept in <hi>Italy,</hi> but only in the Meadows about <hi>Lavinium,</hi> conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>Turnus</hi> by <hi>Aeneas</hi>: both the Meads and Elephants now belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his successors, the <hi>Caesars.</hi>

               <p>Verse 138. <hi>Iphiginia.</hi>] In the beginning of <hi>Sat.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.

               <p>Verse 143. <hi>Death.] Libitina</hi> (so <hi>Juvenal</hi>) was the Goddess, in whose Temple all things appertaining to funerall pomp and ceremony were bought and sold. Some think, the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Libitina</hi> meant <hi>Proserpine,</hi> Queen of the Infernal Regions.

               <p>Verse 56. <hi>Atlas.] Juvenal</hi> thinks it great injustice to poor <hi>Atlas,</hi> that so many new Gods should come into Heaven to oppress him with their weight: one of the number being <hi>Hercules,</hi> that once eased him of his load.</p>
               <p>Verse 65. Four years precedence.] <hi>Apud antiquissimos</hi> Romanorum, <hi>&amp;c. Among the most ancient</hi> Romans, <hi>neither to the greatness of birth or wealth was more honour done; then by the younger to the elder persons, which they reverenced, and worshipped, almost as much as their Parents, and the</hi> Gell. lib. 2. cap. 15.</p>

               <p>Verse 99. <hi>Wishes his Son's head boil'd.</hi>] The Rogue, when he denies a sum of money deposited in his hands; after he hath sworn by all the Artillery of Heaven, will not stick to make Imprecations against himself; and wish, that he may fare like <hi>Thyestes,</hi> that eat the head of his own Son. See the end of the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. Only this perjur'd Villain would have worse sawce then <hi>Thyestes</hi> had: for, his story mentions no vinegar made in the Isle of <hi>Pharos,</hi> which is the sharpest in the world.</p>
               <p>Verse 101. <hi>All things by chance were made</hi>] An opinion detested by <hi>Seneca,</hi> that sayes, <hi>Nature, Fate, Fortune, Chance,</hi> are all names of one and the same God.</p>
               <p>Verse 102. <hi>No first Mover.</hi>] A Villain would gladly make himself believe there is no God, if he could: but, as my Lord of <hi>St. Albons</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though the fool in his heart hath <hi>said</hi> there is no God, yet he hath not <hi>thought</hi> so. <hi>A vicen</hi> affirms; <hi>He that sees not God in nature, wants not only reason, but even sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 104. <hi>Touch any Altars.</hi>] When a man would put a Trustee to his oath, he brought him into the Temple, and there made him swear, laying his hand upon the Altar. A great example of this custome, with the punishment of the perjured Rogue, we have in the history of <hi>Herodotus</hi> One <hi>Archetimus,</hi> in his journey, deposited a great summe of gold in the hands of his Host <hi>Cydias.</hi> When he returned, he asked for his gold: <hi>Cydias</hi> absolutely denyed it. After a long contest, the Plaintiff referred
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:93027:263"/>
himself to the Oath of the Defendant. <hi>Cydias</hi> scrupling at Perjury, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to swear by Equivocation; and for that purpose put all the Gold into a great Cane. Upon his day, he appears in a sickly posture, leaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Cane, walks with it to the Temple, and when he kneeled down at the Altar, gave it <hi>Archetimus,</hi> to hold till the ceremony should be ended. Then, lifting up his hands, he confessed upon Oath, that he had received the Gold wherewith he was charged, but withall he swore, that he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain delivered the same individuall Gold to the Defendant. <hi>Archetimus</hi> hearing this, in a fury threw upon the Marble floor the Cane, which with the outward violence, and weight within it broke to pieces, and out came all the Gold. Thus providence righted him: and <hi>Cydias,</hi> by report, dyed miserably.</p>
               <p>Verse 109. <hi>Timbrels.</hi>] Gold, Silver, or Brass Timbrells, used in their ceremonies by the Priests of <hi>Isis,</hi> in whose Temple was the Image of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> with his finger cross his lips, and that Goddess, together with this God of Silence, were believed to send diseases into humane bodies.</p>

               <p>Verse 116. <hi>Nimble</hi> Ladas,] Foot-man to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. He ran so nimbly, that the print of his foot was not seen upon the gravell. His Statue was set up at <hi>Argos,</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> after he had won the foot-race in the Olympick Games. These sacred Games were instituted by <hi>Hercules</hi> in honour of his Father <hi>Jove,</hi> neer to the City of <hi>Olympia</hi> in <hi>Elis.</hi> These consisted of five Exercises; casting the Javelin, flinging the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:93027:263"/>
Iron-ball, leaping, wrestling, and running foot-matches and Chariot-races: they began every five years, and ended in five dayes. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror was crowned with an Olive-wreath, got in a Grove of Olives neer the City of <hi>Pisa</hi> in <hi>Elis</hi>; and therefore by <hi>Juvenal</hi> called <hi>Pisaean</hi> Olive boughs: and such honour was done him, that his Chariot came not in by the City gates, but the walls were pulled down, for him to enter at the breach. From these Games the <hi>Grecians</hi> had their Aera, or account of years, beginning with the first Olympiad, in the year of the <hi>Julian</hi> Period 3938.</p>
               <p>Verse 119. <hi>Say the wrath of Heaven be great, 'tis slow.</hi>] Yet as slow as it is, sure it will be. <hi>Divine wrath by slow degrees proceeds to vengeance; but the long sufferance is payed for by the greatness of the punishment.</hi> Val. Max. <hi>Caesar</hi> sayes gravely, <hi>The Gods are accustomed, that men may be more afflicted with the change of their condition, sometimes to give wicked men prosperous success, and longer impunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 131. <hi>Catullus,</hi>] The Author of the Comedy called <hi>Phasma,</hi> or the <hi>Phantasm,</hi> mentioned <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. wherein, it should seem, there was a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or eccho, that answered and mockt some poor man, till it made him call as loud as <hi>Calvin</hi> cryed out upon his perjured Trustee, that is, saies my Author, as loud as <hi>Homer's Stentor,</hi> that was able to drown the cryes of fifty shouting together: or indeed as loud as <hi>Homer's Mars,</hi> that when he was wounded by <hi>Pallas,</hi> or <hi>Diomedes,</hi> roared louder then the cryes of an Army, when ten thousand men joyn battail. <hi>Hom. Iliad. lib.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>Verse 142. <hi>Bathyllus,</hi>] A rare Lutenist, and an excellent Mimick, to whom a Statue was set up at <hi>Samos</hi> in <hi>Juno's</hi> Temple, by the Tyrant <hi>Polycrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 143. <hi>He,</hi>] That is <hi>Juvenal</hi> himself.</p>

                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:93027:264"/>Verse 145. <hi>A Cloak.</hi>] The Cynicks wore two upper garments: the Stoicks only a thin Cloak. This is all the difference <hi>Juvenal</hi> puts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; for their Doctrine was the same. They both contemned riches, and agreed in this Maxim, <hi>That Virtue needs no addition, but of it self is sufficient to make life happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verse 146. <hi>Epicurus,</hi>] Father of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sect. He placed the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> or felicity of Man, in Pleasure: not as <hi>Aristippus</hi> did, in the pleasure of the Body, but of the Mind; and in the absence of Pain. He condemned the Dialecticks, because he affirmed, that Philosophy might be taught in plain and easie words. He denyed the providence of the Gods in humane affaires. So much is ascribed to him by <hi>Lucretius,</hi> that he confidently avouches, <hi>Epicurus</hi> obscured the light of all the other Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, no less then all other heavenly bodies are darkned by the Sun. And though (from his opinion, that felicity consists in pleasure) all Voluptuaries, by a common mistake, are called <hi>Epicureans</hi>: yet we have, besides this place of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> good authority, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> was a most temperate man: <hi>contenting himself with a little Garden, and feeding upon Herbs; not to provoke hunger, but to satisfie it.</hi> Senec.</p>
               <p>Verse 148. <hi>Philip,</hi>] A Country Chirurgion, yet his Apprentice had skill enough to bleed <hi>Calvin</hi>: therefore <hi>Juvenal,</hi> as somewhat a better Artist, undertakes his cure.</p>
               <p>Verse 152. <hi>Thy dores may well be shut</hi>] It was the <hi>Roman</hi> custome, and is ours at Funerals and in the time of mouring, to shut up the dores, and darken the Rooms. Which the Satyrist wishes men would doe, that have lost their money; because they look upon it as a sadder calamity then the loss of friends or neerest relations: therefore, the grief being greater, why should the signes of grief be less?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="449" facs="tcp:93027:264"/>Verse 162. <hi>Sardonix Seal.</hi>] A coat of Armes cut in a Sardonix; which pretious stone being laid up in a Lord's Cabinet, whereof he himself kept the key; there could be little probability that the impression should be counterfeited.</p>
               <p>Verse 167. <hi>A white Hen.] Albae Gallinae filius, Son of a white Hen,</hi> was a Proverb with the <hi>Romans</hi>: amounting to as much, in point of good luck, as our <hi>English</hi> Proverb, <hi>Wrapt in's Mothers Smock.</hi>

               <p>Verse 180. <hi>Castor.] Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> Sons to <hi>Jupiter</hi> by <hi>Laeda, Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> the King of <hi>Sparta's</hi> Wife, deceiv'd by <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the shape of a Swan, by whom she had two egges, and Twins in both: in the first, <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi>: in the other, <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Clytemnestra.</hi> These Brothers cleered the <hi>Laconick</hi> Sea of <hi>Pyrates,</hi> and for that action were accounted Gods of the Sea, and prayed unto by Marriners in a Tempest. They went with the <hi>Argonauts</hi> to <hi>Colchos</hi>: in which voyage, <hi>Pollux</hi> killed <hi>Amycus</hi> King of the <hi>Bebrycians,</hi> that would have intercepted him. At their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Country, they recovered their Sister <hi>Helen,</hi> stoln by <hi>Theseus</hi>: and in his absence took a City from him. VVhen <hi>Castor</hi> died, the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> (as true historians as <hi>Lucian</hi>) say that <hi>Pollux</hi> (who, as aforesaid, was hatcht out of the same immortall Egge with <hi>Helen</hi>) prayed to his Father <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that he might divide his immortality with his Brother: which suit being granted, they both died, and both revived. This Fable was invented from those Stars, the celestiall Twins, called <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> both rising and setting together. <hi>Castor</hi> had a Temple in <hi>Rome,</hi> where the great money-Masters kept their iron-barred Trunks, when they durst no longer trust <hi>Mars</hi> with them. <hi>Sat.</hi> 14.

some of this gold <hi>Castor</hi> had for guarding it, though not very much, as may be gathered by his coat of Plate, beaten very thin.</p>
               <p>Verse 185. <hi>In an Oxe-hide.</hi>] For many hundreds of years, from the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> there was no Law made against a Child for killing of his Father or Mother: nor on the other part, against Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for murdering their Children. Both <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> forbore to make any such Law, because they thought it impossible that such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety should be committed; and likewise because the prohibition might prove a provocation to the crime. <hi>Cic. pro Sext. Rosc.</hi> The wickedness of after Ages inforced the legislative power to punish those unnatural Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this manner; The Murderer was sowed up in a leathern Sack with a Viper, and so cast into the Sea. <hi>Senec. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Controv.</hi> 4. <hi>in fine.</hi> But in <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s time the Viper had the company of an Ape. <hi>Sat.</hi> 8.

Then, a dispute hapning between <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Jove,</hi> Whether male or female had more sense of pleasure, <hi>Tiresias</hi> was made Umpire, and gave judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>Jove,</hi> that the pleasure is greater in the female. For this, <hi>Juno</hi> took away his sight: others say he was struck blind when he saw <hi>Pallas</hi> naked. <hi>Jove,</hi> to recompence the loss of his sight, gave him the spirit of foresight, making him a Prophet. <hi>Vlysses</hi> questioned his soul in <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zium,</hi> as in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 9. The Monument of <hi>Tiresias</hi> was erected at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Tilphossus</hi> in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> neer to the Fountain <hi>Tilphossa,</hi> where, in the time of his banishment, he ended his life by a draught of cold water, which in extreme old age oppressed his spirits in a moment. After his death, the <hi>Thebans</hi> gave him divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Of his transformation read <hi>Ovid. Metam. lib.</hi> 3.</p>

Family in his Throne. Having lost his Crown, and with it his Friends, he fled to his Sister <hi>Deidamia's</hi> Husband, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Son to <hi>Antigonus:</hi> and commanded under him, at the great battail where all the Kings, that divided <hi>Alexander</hi>'s conquests, were ingaged. There he, though a young man, had the honor, where he fought, to worst the Enemy. In <hi>Aegypt</hi> he grew so great a Courtier, that Queen <hi>Berenice's</hi> Daughter, <hi>Antigona,</hi> loved and married him, and won her Mother to move the King her Step-father, for money and forces, to reestablish her Husband in his Kingdome. Entring <hi>Epire</hi> with an Army, he found his People weary of their present Governor, <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> all came in to their King. But <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> fearing that <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> would follow his example, and get some forrein Prince to espouse his quarrell, divided the Crown with him. Soon after, discovering that his Brother-King had a plot upon his life, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> invited him to Supper, and there killed him. In memory of his Patron and Patroness, the King and Queen of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he called his Son by <hi>Antigona, Ptolemey:</hi> and the City he built in <hi>Epire, Berenice.

He was, in the opinion of great Souldiers, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, next to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that ever the world had. <hi>Antigonus</hi> being asked whom he held to be the best Generall? answered, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>; if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be old. But, for conduct and policy, <hi>Hannibal</hi> gave the first place to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> the second to <hi>Scipio,</hi> the third to himself. The Officers of his Army, when he fought a battail, observing his looks, celerity and motion, said, Other Kings were like <hi>Alexander</hi> in their State and Courts, but <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> in his armes and in the field.

When he came to <hi>Athens</hi> no Begger could be poorer, all his Wardrobe was a double Cloak, which he wore in the day time, and used for a Bed at night; lying upon it, either in <hi>Jove</hi>'s Portico, or in the Pompaeum; both which he said the <hi>Athenians</hi> built for his Dormitories.

For these and such like words he had his freedome given him, together with the tuition of his Master's Children.

               <p>Verse 3. <hi>Crocodile,</hi>] A Serpent of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> that, from an egge no bigger then a Goose-egge, grows to be above two and twenty cubits long; which no other creature does, that is at first so little. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> know, how high the River <hi>Nilus</hi> will rise that year, by the place where this egge is hatcht. He is armed with impenetrable scales. In the day time he lives upon the land; in the night, upon the water. When his belly is full of fish, he lies down upon the shore, with his mouth open: a little bird (there called <hi>Trochilos,</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> the King of birds) first picks his teeth, then tickles his gummes, in which pleasure he falls a sleep: And the <hi>Ichneumon,</hi> a kind of Rat, running down his throat like an arrow shot into his Bowels, gnawes asunder his womb, which is the only tender part about him. Upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Nilus</hi> there is a People called <hi>Tentyrites,</hi> which mortally hate this Serpent, that is terrible to those that flye from him, but flyes from those that pursue him: which only these men dare doe. He is said to be purblind in the water, and quick-sighted on the land. Some affirme
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:93027:295"/>
that of all creatures he only grows as long as he lives; and lives to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old. <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</p>

The <hi>Ibis</hi> is a filthy bird.

Even the ridiculous</hi> Aegyptians <hi>worship no Monster, but for some good it doth them: as the</hi> Ibes, <hi>that kills a vast number of Serpents, being a strong great bird with stiffe thighs, and a horney beak. They preserve</hi> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt <hi>from the plague, by watching and killing the flying Serpents, which the Southwest wind brings out of the</hi> Libyan <hi>Desarts: whereby they neither doe hurt, when alive, by biting: nor by their stink, when they are dead.</hi> Cic. de Nat. Deor.</p>

The reason of the Decree was, That the world might know how much the people of <hi>Athens</hi> honoured good men alive and dead. The Sect of the Stoicks sprung out of the Cynicks; and their principles, as in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 13. were the same, <hi>viz.

When they had no more Dead men to preserve the Living, they raised a pile of wood in the Market-place, where they burned themselves, and all they had.

                  <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> the easier to perswade his Auditors, affirmed that he himself was first Son to <hi>Mercury,</hi> his name <hi>Aethalides</hi>: and that his Father bid him chuse his suit, and it should be granted, excepting immortality: He asked, that no change of his soul might deprive him of the memory of

things past. After he dyed as <hi>Aethalides,</hi> he lived again as <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> then as <hi>Hermotimus</hi>; then he was a Delian Fisherman, called <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus. Pyrrhus</hi> dying, he revived as <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> This opinion of the Souls migration, he learned from the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> and from their Priests (undoubtedly) he had his abstinence from flesh and herbs, not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself all kinds of puls: for, he abstained from beans. What a ridiculous appearance we see in the story of his <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy? Can any body then blame <hi>Lucian</hi> for jeering at him, and bringing the soul of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> into a Coblers Cock, that was interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, <hi>Why he would eat no beans when he was</hi> Pythagoras? whereunto he answered, <hi>If I had not in some things been extraordinary, I should not have been so followed.</hi> Lucian in Mycill. Truly I am thus far of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and his Pattern, King <hi>Numa,</hi> would never have brought the Common-people to submit to their Authority and Lawes, If they had not first won them to a beliefe, that their Law-givers were more then men. This made the <hi>Crotonians</hi> and <hi>Metapontines</hi> reverence his Lawes; and suffer him to reduce them, by his doctrine, from their luxurious vanity: insomuch as the women, wrought upon by his integrity and strictness of life, hung up their wanton Ornaments and Vests of cloth of gold, in the Temple of <hi>Juno.</hi> After he had lived long amongst the <hi>Crotonians,</hi> he went to <hi>Metapontus,</hi> and there dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. About the manner of his death tradition differs very much. But in how great esteem he lived with the <hi>Metapontines,</hi> they manifested af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his decease, by consecrating his house into a Temple, and giving him divine honours. He was the first that named Philosophy, and himself Philosopher, a lover of wisdome: the reason for it I have given you in the Comment upon <hi>Sat.</hi> 3. <hi>tit. Pythagoras.</hi> He thought, that in heavenly

And they held a crime committed against this Deitie, by removing a Bounderstone, to be the greatest of all Sacriledges.</hi>

               <p>Verse 71. <hi>That's his own which he hath earned,</hi>] All that a Roman ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by his labour and patience in the Warres, was cleerly his own; not of the essence of his Patrimony, which appertained to his Father by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivorship, in case that during his Son's life he had not emancipated, or made him free; for, a Sonne, being <hi>in potestate Patris,</hi> could give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way nothing by Will, unless he were a Souldier, whose military Oath gave him his freedome; and enabled him to dispose of whatsoever he had got in the service of his Country. Knowing this priviledg, <hi>Coranus</hi> (though he was old, and had one foot in the Grave) courted his young Son, that was a Souldier, and might therefore die before him, without leaving a Legacie, out of the Profits and Proceeds of his Pay, to his Father, unless the old man (like a common Captator) pleased him with Presents.</p>
