         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The whole ſtorie is in 2. Chr. in Ioſias, theſe were killed both in one day.

                  <p>So by Olympiad and by Conſuls, <hi>Beroald</hi> overcommeth the Grand <hi>Scaliger,</hi> much more <hi>Caiphas,</hi> with <hi>Barabas.</hi> And ſo all Churches, <hi>Albion</hi> in our <hi>Geneua: France</hi> in in <hi>Genebrard: Portugals</hi> in <hi>Hector Pintius: Heydelbergh</hi> in <hi>Tremelius: Zurich</hi> in <hi>Wolphius:</hi> the millions of the companies ſhall bee iudged to follow God &amp; his Angell: as the captivitie prophetes, teach infinitlie, and all the new Teſtament.

I ſhewed more ſearch of Greekes for Daniel, then all that ever were before me, for the common clearing of the Goſpell: and the builders of Iericho, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane contemners of trueth, the railers againſt their owne good, ſhall feele they buy eternal flames, denying our Lords death to be in tyme according to the prophecie, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed his coming into the world, to be in due eſtate of time, when the double Macedonians were argued to fall: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his paſſage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe to the Father, againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell

and the Greeke ſumme of faith: honouring Hell with their Athean Lies, that they, in the courſe they hold, may be ſure to haue it their eternall lodging. But all who love the trueth, will holde all the former poinctes aright, to make a pleaſant Scripture Concent.</p>

                  <head>Of Generall contempt of all the Bible.</head>
                  <p>WHereas Rabbi <hi>Abraham Ruben</hi> ſtirred vp by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, <hi>M. Edw. Barton,</hi> of godly memorie, ſent an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to England, requeſting an explication of our Goſpell to his Ebrewes: and againſt this cauſe <hi>D. Bancroft</hi> conſpired a libell, that the Epiſtle was forged: his blames herein be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and great. Iewes would thinke him diverſlie enemie to Chriſtendome. Firſt, that he envied their honoring of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as better in Ebrewes then them ſelves. They ſay, they did never ſo before: and thinke they ſhall never do ſo again. Secondly, that he laboured to hinder the glorie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: where they heard that one brought all the Bible into frame, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Thalmudiques. Thirdly, that he envied Iewes ſalvation: which doeing argueth that he never knew God: nor hath for him ſelfe any ſure hope of life. As the Iewes would compaſſe ſea &amp; lande to make one proſelyts, ſo they would require equall zeale in vs, if we be of God. Beſides Iewes all men would holde this dealing bad. The Agent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorced the Iewes Epiſtle to me, and it came to London and to Croydon, and <hi>Bancroft</hi> might haue read it, if hee could: and ſhould be ſure what it conteyned before he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to libell that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was ſent to Baſill, another was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſteed of it. Beſides Archb. Wh. ſente me worde that he would give me allowance to anſwere, if I would requeſt
<pb facs="tcp:14687:16"/>
that. But I ſaide, I could not defende Englande. Which denyed the ſtorie of ſalvation for our Lords paſſage hence to the Father, through the veile of his fleſh into the moſt holy. <hi>Bancroft</hi> libelling that I forged the Epiſtle, that the people ſhould require no anſwere, little pleaſed God, or any ſage men. Moreover, all learned will ſweare he was vnlearned, that would thinke any of Chriſtian ſtudie in Ebrew &amp; Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique could followe the Rabbin for ſtyle: and perpetuitie of ſpeach: with contempt of periodes. Beſides, none would nor could counterfait the whole matter: over and beſides, a Iew in London tranſlated that into Latin: and D. <hi>Bancroft</hi> might haue enquired how that differed nothing from that Printed at Baſill. Moreover, ſagenes would not ſoone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the Vniverſitie of Baſill would allowe a thing to be printed, which might in any ſorte bee thought forged. Iewes from Prage receaved from a Iewe of <hi>Baſill</hi> fieldes one copye: they write to him, that the Byzantian Iew was their beſt Rabbin, and was drawen to favour Chriſtianitie by one of England: and would cauſe other Iewes much diſturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The Iewe ſpake this to Syr <hi>Iohn Payton</hi> and his tutor at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill</hi>: and our Marchants from Thrace reporte that the Iewe doth acknowledge his Epiſtle Printed as he ſent it: &amp; daylie teſtified to <hi>Graecians,</hi> that he never hoped to ſee ſo much for our Goſpell as he read from one of England. Hence all may ſee what <hi>D Bancroft</hi> is: voyde of Religion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reverence of men: as when he conſpired to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>Barrow</hi> and <hi>Greenwood</hi> for beleeving as Archb. Wh. and D. Bilſon proove moſt ſubſtantially, that the Greek Creede taught. Such dealing hath not lightly bene heard, that men ſhould die for beleeving as their accuſers beleeved. Though they were condemned for diſturbance of the State, that was
<pb facs="tcp:14687:16"/>
pardoned if they would come to Church. And they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the addition vnlawfull: to ioyne with them that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved falſlie our Lordes ſoule went to Hell. And well they might: as Archb. Wh. and D. Bilſon agreed with them: yet <hi>D. Bancroft</hi> ſtill vrgeth honor for Hell: as telling of his bent thither: even as endevouring to hinder clearing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell for Iewes. So hee raved at blame of Geneveans, brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, as he libelled that, <hi>Armiferam Thracen qui regat alter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and raved againſt opening of our Lordes Familie, and threatned to ſtay the K. from allowance to cleare our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to Iewes: All theſe dealings warne that hee bee not a Maran Atha. Sharpe warninge may ſave him, if hee haue any G. beſides his title. This twelve yeares iniuries call for vengeance. When Q. E. ſent me word that I ſhould choſe my preferment, and meant a ſpeciall place: he by learning prevented that. And that nothing greeved me. But wher he brent my bookes for theſe wordes, as treaſon: <hi>The King of our language:</hi> and brent them twice: once vnder Q. Eliz. againe vnder K. I. I haue merveiled how he is in favour after ſuch dealing. Alſo he brent an Epiſtle to Archb, Wh. which hee allowed, for the true meaning of the Creede: as though that pranke ſerved not ſatan in high diligence. Beſides, he conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to a libell, Blaſpheming that our Lord ſhould ſay: The Kings of the nations tyrannically rule over them. This blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is Athean Barbarous. And when I at Baſill fought againſt the Popes Chalenger for Bancroftes faith, then the thankfull Papas or Father (the name is not bad) was content that a libell ſhould kome againſt God, againſt all learning, againſt the K. and Bretanes all: Pretending to deale but with one. And in that he giveth me the terme Aſſe, He, or Bar Lo
<pb facs="tcp:14687:17"/>
giveth the Name. But I hope all that marke my penne, will bidde them take their owne terme to them ſelves: And I humbly require leaue to pleade with Doctor Bancroft, with as much freedome for my bookes to be read, as hee had for the Libell, moſt Athean againſt God and man. I might doe good teaching Doctor Bancroft how his faith &amp; proceeding agree with the worde of God: though not ſo much as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening all the Bible in Ebrew to all the world: I might doe good: but not the moſt good. But whereas he threatned he would hinder your Maieſtie from the moſt glorious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that can be offered to honour your Kingdome: if hee have prevailed that your Maieſtie will deſpiſe that cauſe, I humblie requeſt leaue to complaine of his proceedinges ſo, as <hi>Francfurt Mart,</hi> may quietly trie betweene vs. I would gladlie keepe Peace with all men, and if your Archb. could be quiet: I could otherwiſe haue ſpent my time, and not medle with your Eccleſiaſticall men. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalow Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers cannot be quiet, your Maieſtie will not bee angrie at a penne of Pacification.</p>
