            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I first intended to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate these <hi>Poems</hi> to Your Name, beside the Thoughts of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, I Was chiefly deterr'd by the Consideration of these Two Things, the Greatness of Your Quality and the Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of your Judgment: But then I was a little Encourag'd again, when I reflected, that the Meanest Creature was not debarr'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Address to the Highest of Beings, but was rather commanded it; and that the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Mistakes of well-meaning Men are likely to become rather the Pity, than the Scorn of Angels. Nor could I think it less, than a Natural Duty; that my humble <hi>Muse</hi> should offer the Best of Her Increase to that Family, to whose Bounty and Encouragement She ows all She is; since even the Gratefull <hi>Indians</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Eat or Drink, till they have first powred out a Part as an Offering to that Bright Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary, from whole Influence they believe, All, they receive doth proceed.</p>
                  <p>I am very sensible and cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:94520:3"/>
that there are many Things lyable to Exception in the Ensuing <hi>Poems</hi>; but they may well be Pardon'd, for the Sake of the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> which is Consecrate to Your Name, and thereby receives a Peculiar Grace and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which cannot but diffuse it self thrô the whole Work. I confess even <hi>there</hi> what belongs to Me is full of Weakness; but it could be no otherwise, since in Subjects so Sublime, as Your Self, the most Towring Flights must of necessity flag, Things too High above Us not admitting a Definition; and as in Beauteous Faces there is something, We cannot Name, that exceeds the Pencil's Art, so in Excellent Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages there are Vertues, of which Common Souls have no Notion; but they Soar above the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Loftiest Fancy. And surely no One is to be blam'd for going no farther; if He goes as far as the Subject will bear: For He is not ty'd to Impossibilities. And doubtless thô Poetry is usually suspected of Flattery, yet any One, who considers the Charms of Your Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Sharpness of Your Wit, the Depth of Your Judgment, the Candour of Your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Nobility of your Birth, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that You are plac'd above the reach of it; that, which would be Flattery to another, not

measuring the least Part of Your Perfections; so that, if the Boldest and most Happy <hi>Genius</hi> should take the utmost bounds of Poetick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in order to Praise Your Merit, He would find the Folly of his Attempt, and soon be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with Confusion to give over the Impossible Design. For I suppose, there is None, but will grant, that the Highest-Encomiums in Praise of the <hi>Sun</hi> are lost; every One having a Greater <hi>Idea</hi> of that Luminary than can be express'd, and He is still as far above their Praise, as their Reach. Wherefore if Princes are best able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the secrets of Empire, Experienc'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders matters of War, and Gallant Minds Heroick Vertues, I am inexcusably to blame, who have undertaken a Province too Difficult for Me to perform, and which requires the Pen of something more than a Man; which Crime I yet humbly beg Your Honour to forgive; since thô there may ly a Fault in my Ignorance and Rashness, yet, I am sure, there is none in the Design; since there is no One hath a Greater Zeal, for the Glory of Your Honourable Family, than He, who is</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE To the READER</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM sufficiently sensible under what Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages these <hi>Poems</hi> come out, in which there is nothing either Profane, Obscene, or Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to recommend them, the usual Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishments of Things of this Nature; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which commonly the worse they are, the better they are accepted. Yet this I Studiously avoided, such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations neither agreeing with my Temper, nor Profession, and least of all with the Vertuous Character of that Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Person, to whom they are Dedicated. Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was I willing to gratifie the profaneness of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,</hi> nor the ill-Nature of the Seditious, who love to feed their Eyes, as the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> did on Bleeding <hi>Gladiators:</hi> Nor did I think it worth my while <hi>to feed Swine.</hi> There are certainly Subjects of Indifferency enow to employ a Man's leisure Hours, without medling with Thunderbolts, or Gibbets, or Diseases; and it requires no
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:94520:4"/>
Great Capacity to choose which is Best, either to live at Quiet and Peace, or have the Fate of an <hi>Ovid</hi> or a <hi>Cicero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And since this is an Age of Politicks and every One pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a Right, if not in Administring, yet at least in Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring, the Government, I hope this may escape Censure-free, since it hath no Relation unto it; and if News is the thing, that is most acceptable, that which Men of all Estates gape after, and take upon Trust without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, This Work of Mine, which consists of News too, and is (like much of that) pure Invention (for <hi>Poets</hi> are not ty'd to the Rules of <hi>Historians</hi>) may receive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Entertainment. If it hath but its Turn, I am satisfied, thô afterwards it be confuted, for that is the Common Fate: And yet for ought I know, this may fare better, than is expected; for 'tis a <hi>Poetical</hi> Time; the Common Discourse and News-Letters are arrant <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and Large Legends of Wandring Knights and the <hi>Quixotes</hi> of the Age. Men are <hi>Poets,</hi> thô they are not sensible of it, and Dote on the Ravings of their Own or Others Brains, thô they are wilder than the Centaurs, Giants, and Monsters, and all the <hi>Chimaera's</hi> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Men now adays want no <hi>Invention</hi> (one main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of <hi>Poetry</hi>) and if they do <hi>Coherence,</hi> 'tis but imagining it <hi>Pindarique,</hi> and it goes off: As for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, 'tis not much stood on in a Science, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing goes down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The True Design of these <hi>Poems</hi> was to draw Men's Minds, that are Idle, from more Dangerous, and as little profitable, Speculations: For Such, as have nothing to do, usually do what they should not, and are most Susceptible of Evil-Maxims against <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> And 'tis the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of <hi>Academies</hi> to amuze Young Students Minds (which usually are hot and unbyass'd, have much of Sharpness and little of Solidity) with <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which thô it be confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:94520:5"/>
of great Vse, yet one not the most Contemptible may be to bridle Young Wits from running too soon upon <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Those therefore, that are least able to <hi>Judge,</hi> being the most apt to <hi>Censure</hi> as half-witted Men are always suspicious) my Design was to draw them to <hi>Poetry,</hi> which concerns them as much, as <hi>Politicks</hi> do, and that is Nothing at all; and to make them of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cobler's mind, who in a general Tumult upon the Death of <hi>Caesar</hi> enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the News and being told, He was kill'd in the <hi>Senate</hi>-house, slunk into his Bulk again and cry'd, <hi>He was a Cobler still.</hi> For why should those Men, who see not upon what Center things turn round, think the Government is behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them for their Ridiculous. Care? If I miss of my Design, I shall not much trouble my Self, many better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects having come to Nothing; Things of Indifferency not being valued, but All esteem'd Good or Bad, as it pleases or displeases a Faction.</p>
