         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>EVery Person, who comes into
this World under the Guilt of
Sin, is a Debtor to Death.
And this Debt sooner or later
all must pay; even they, who fence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about with the strongest Armies,
or heap up Riches as if they were always
to possess them, or whose daily Business it
is to drown all Thoughts of Death in the
Noise of Mirth and Pleasures. In the
midst of all their Care and Labour to
avoid him, Death will surely meet them,
and spoil all their Glory and Iollity; and
that commonly when they least expect him.
And then he makes them see their own
Vanity, and the Vanity of all earthly
things, which nothing else could teach
them to consider of. For he shews us the
Shame of our Bodies, and makes the
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:107394:3"/>
Pride of Human Greatness to become an
easie Conquest and inglorious Prey for
Worms, and brings all earthly Hopes and
Projects to end and hide themselves in
Dust.</p>
            <p>This is a thing, which all Men know,
and all Men fear. And they who study
most, to keep the Thoughts of Death far
from them, do yet certainly know that it
will come. And happy then is he, whose
Mind is so well prepared and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortified,
that it can neither fright nor hurt him;
who has disarmed this<note n="†" place="margin">Job. 18. 14.</note> 
               <hi>King of Terrors,</hi>
and made this great Enemy of Nature
to become a Friend.</p>
            <p>All this, Religion will do, if we will
make a right use of it. For<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> 
               <hi>the sting of
death is sin,</hi> and true Repentance takes
that out. And if we take care, that our
Life contain nothing terrifying, our Death
need not. And the compleatest Victory
over Death is Eternal Life, and the same
Repentance secures us thereof. And Trust
in God fortifies us against Fear, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
makes our Pains lighter. So that
whilst by true Devotion we are spending
our selves in these Exercises, we are dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our Souls in Armour, which will not
only sustain the Shock of Death, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
it with all its Strength and Terror.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:107394:3"/>
And the business of these Papers, is
to furnish out thoughts for all those who
are willing and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sirous to use the same,
whereby all this may be done. And
whereby we may receive Sickness, and
meet. Death, so as at the same time to
have enough under them to support and
comfort us, and in the end to be made
better by both.</p>
            <p>And all this I treat of, not as a man
who is preaching to men at ease, who
must be diverted and entertained with
nice inquiries, and fine discourses and
speculations about Death. But as one
who is called to sick and dying Persons,
who desire to be helped and directed in
things of use, and told those matters which
are fit, to support and ease their weary
Souls, and to dress them in such habits,
as are the best defence both against the
sting and terror of their approaching
Enemy.</p>
            <p>I have first, according to the best of my
skill, given them directions what to do,
and wherein to spend their care, thro, all
the steps and progress of their sickness,
from its first seisure to their departure. I
show them what will render their sick-bed
carriage rewardable, and its Sorrows
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olerable and comfortable. How they
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:107394:4"/>
are like to be most easie to themselves, and
may most profitably chuse or improve the
Company, and employ and receive the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and kind Offices of others. What
they are to do, that they may dye well,
and be happy and full of Comfort in their
Death and after it; and how it is fit
for them to part with all men, and
take a decent and a Christian leave of
this World.</p>
            <p>And in regard Devotion is the chief
work, and the best support of sick and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Persons, to these directions, I have
added <hi>Offices of Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these, I have made collections of
select and proper Scriptures, upon the
several duties and necessities of sick or
dying Persons, which I have ranged and
put in order the best I can, for their
comfort and instruction. And these they
may resort to, as a Storehouse of Divine
Sentences, fit to direct their practice in
the virtues, and to cheer and revive their
Spirits under all the sorrows of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
<hi>How forceable are right
words,</hi> says <hi>Job</hi> under the bitterness of
his sorrows. <hi>Job 6. 25. And heaviness in
the heart of man maketh it stoop:
but a good word maketh it glad,</hi> says
<hi>Solomon</hi> Prov. 12. 25. But the good
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:107394:4"/>
words which God himself speaks to us, do
leave a much stronger impression, and
give more ease, and do more revive and
make glad the Heart, than any others.</p>
            <p>And after these collections of Scriptures,
I have furnished them with variety of fit
and proper Prayers, upon their several
Duties, or Needs, in that condition.
And as I was able, I have stored those
Prayers with such proper thoughts and
considerations, as may serve at once, both
to express and put up to God the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
bounden duties and tempers required
of us, and also to ingenerate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the same in our own minds.</p>
            <p>And to these for <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>dying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
I have annexed like Devotional
helps, for <hi>Women with Child,</hi> or in
<hi>Child Birth,</hi> and for some other cases
of <hi>Bodily distempers</hi> and <hi>Calamities.</hi>
And to conclude all, I have added De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions
<hi>on the Death of Friends,</hi> and
made particular Prayers for those cases
which usually are most affecting, and
provided them with such considerations,
as seem to me to be most proper and of
greatest force to support and comfort us,
under such mortifying and afflictive
losses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:107394:5"/>
And in all these Prayers, I have taken
care to be as instructive as I can, in the
several States and Cases they refer to,
that we may see what our work and
wants are under them, and know what
we have to mind and do therein, better
than we knew before. And so likewise in
the several duties, which the Prayers are
made upon. For I have endeavoured
therein, especially in the Prayers about
<hi>Trust in God,</hi> and about <hi>Patience</hi>
(which are the virtues most tryed on sick-beds,
and indeed of most general use
thro the whole course of our lives) to
set off the several Acts, wherein we are
to exercise and show forth those Graces;
and the most proper and important helps
and considerations, whereby we are like
to be most quickened, and best assisted
in our performance of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when any are desirous to encrease
knowledge, and improve their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
therein, they may read the
Prayers, or have them read to them, tho
not in way of Devotion, but as Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
upon them.</p>
            <p>And these Offices for sick or dying Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
should not be neglected or thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
by men in Health, as if they were a
Study and Employment only for sick-beds.
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:107394:5"/>
For living men must think of Death, and
prepare for it, as well as dying: and if
whilst health and strength lasts, we
throw these Thoughts and Preparations
by, when it comes it will be like to
find us unready. And then we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dye comfortably, nor safely.</p>
            <p>For when once <hi>the Bridegroom is
come,</hi> as our Saviour tells us<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>

               <hi>Oyle in their Lamps,</hi> and
need to seek it, when they should <hi>go out

will not be opened again for them. If
they are ready with Oyle in their Lamps,

               </note> 
               <hi>the Cry of the Bridegroom
comes</hi> they may fall to <hi>trim</hi> them: but
they must not have their Oyle to seek, or
the virtues of a death-bed to learn, when
they are called forth to show and take
comfort in them.</p>
            <p>Besides, Repentance, and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and satisfaction for injuries, and
settling ones worldly affairs, are a work
most fit and proper for the best days of
life. And resignation, and trust in God,
and patience, and thankfulness, (the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:107394:6"/>
great virtues and employment of sick-beds)
are all Duties as necessary and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in Health, as they are in sickness.
Death it self, is but the last Act, and
end of Life. And those spiritual exercises,
which make us at last to dye well and
happyly, are but the last Acts of those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which had made us live well and
Holily before.</p>
            <p>Defer not <hi>therefore, as the wise Son
of</hi> Syrach <hi>says,</hi> untill Death to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.
But humble thy self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou be sick, and in the time of
sins shew Repentance. Before Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
examine thy self, and in the
day of visitation thou shalt find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<hi>Ecclus.</hi> 18, 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>But when we come to be sick, then are
we most especially to make such Offices
our Employment, and to seek to them as
our chiefest comfort. And each one may
pick out Prayers for himself on one Head
or another, according as those wants
shall require, which at that time are most
pressing upon his body or his spirit, or
which in the present temper of his Soul
he is best disposed for. And he may use some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
more of them, and sometimes fewer,
according as he finds his strength and time
will bear. And these, when he is in strength
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:107394:6"/>
and circumstances fit for it, he may read
himself; but at other times, they may
be read to him for his spirit to repeat and
send up to God, by some religious Friend
who attends about him. Or they may be
read to him, as a Chapter of seasonable
and needful Doctrine and Direction,
which will lay such considerations before
him, as are fit to guide and comfort him
in that condition, when he is less able
to bear the Fatigue and expensive pains of
Devotion.</p>
            <p>As for some distempers, they are slow and
chronical, and carry us off by lingring
degrees. And in these, men have time
enough to employ, if they have but the
Will and Heart to employ it, in these or
such like Offices, which teach them both
how to sustain sickness, and how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for Death.</p>
            <p>Other Distempers, indeed, are more
violent and acute, which both carry us
off suddenly, and whilst we are strugling
with them, leave us little mental vigor or
ability. And under these, there is less
to be done in this way. But something
may be done, tho more short and broken:
and with more application and liveliness,
when it pleases God they have intervals of
ease, or any recruit of spirits. And they
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:107394:7"/>
have great need to make the best of these
opportunities, and to do as much as they
can in their condition, and spend as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thoughts in such Devotions as they
have leisure and strength for. And as
for the great defectiveness in exercising
these Death-bed Graces, which will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
attend this case, it will be
best provided for, by their making these
thoughts their great business, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarizing
the same to their minds in
time of Health.</p>
            <p>In these matters, tho many and the most
important things, are common to all sick
or dying Persons; yet some are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to each, and all have not the same
wants or complaints. And therefore
whilst a Prayer descends to particulars,
to suit and serve one persons case; it
may contain some clauses or expressions,
which are not suitable to anothers. But
in this, the Readers themselves are to
have and use a discretion, and must omit
such passages as do not belong to them, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
use only of the rest which do. And
think, that altho these passges are not for
their use, yet hitting the case of others who
are touched and afflicted in those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
they may be received and used by
them with great thankfulness.</p>

This Treatise I had begun, and had made
some considerable progress in it; but had laid
it aside again, by reason of some hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances.
But afterwards being brought
my self into a state of more uncertain
Health and Life, by the most wise and
good ordering of Almighty God, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
it, and made such haste, as the
needful attendacne of my health would
allow, to finish it. For I was desirous, to
have some benefit, and help thereby my self,
whilst I live; as well as to leave it to be
some way helpful unto others, and come in

FOR AN
Holy and Happy Death,
In very Particular, but Brief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
how to order and carry
our Selves, under Sickness and the
Several Tryals and Accidents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and at the Approach of Death.</head>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Sick mans thoughts of leaving
the World, and setting his Affairs in
Order: and of the care of his Body.</head>
               <p>WHen God arrests us with
Sickness, 'tis time to
think of leaving this
World. Not that every Man who
falls Sick, must presently give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107394:9"/>
up for Dead: but because Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
puts Life in hazard, and brings
a Man to Resign himself into the
Hands of God, whether he shall dye
thereof or no.</p>
               <p>To think of leaving the World,
is not only profitable, but needful at
all times. For the Great Business we
have to do here, is to prepare for an
happy Departure. And if we do
not think of it, we are like to be
very ill prepared for it. In our dayes
of Health and Pleasure, we must call
these thoughts to us; but when Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
comes, it calls us to them, and
Naturally imprints the same. And it
is our truest wisdom, to entertain
them in our Sickness. For if we dye,
we shall all judge it was the best
way we had to employ our thoughts;
and that of all things, Death should
not be met unthought of. And
they render us fitter to Live, if
God spare us. They make Death
Safer, but do not hasten or bring it
sooner; and are no hindrance to our
Living longer, but a great help if
we recover to our Living better.</p>
               <p>In this Preparation to leave the
World, the Sick Persons first care,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107394:9"/>
is to seperate himself from worldly
cares and incumbrances of Business.
Let him look upon himself, as one
call'd off from the conduct of these
matters, to the giving a strict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>m. And who has work
enough cut out for his thoughts and
prepare to take a decent leave of this
World, and to<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 25. 7.</note>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his Soul for a better.
His business now is, how to meet
Death with most safety and comfort
to himself, if he dyes, as for ought
he knows he may dye of this Sickness;
and to commit no Errors therein,
because he is to dye, but once, and
cannot afterwards amend them. The
work and worldly Cares of Life, are
to be left to those who think of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
but how to dye is the Business
that lyes before him.</p>
               <p>To cast off these worldly Cares,
'tis fit he first settle them. And
that is by setting his House in order,
and <hi>making his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, methinks, should be done
with great consideration, and Men
are wanting in that Prudence and
Care, which they usually shew in
their affairs thro all their Lives, if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107394:10"/>
this is left to be clapt up in haste at
their Deaths. When they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of a little parcel of Land, or
of a moderate sum of money, they
consider well of it before they
part with it. And if they are thus
considerate, when they dispose of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
single Branch of their Estate,
must that be left to be the only hasty
and unconsidered act, when they
are to dispose of all?</p>
               <p>When a Person has his Worldly
Estate to give away, it will take
much thought to do it like a wise
Man, and a good Christian. To
consider, what Portions are fit to be
given to Dependants, as Recompence
of Diligence and good Services.
What to Benefactors, as respectful
tokens of Gratitude, for Favours
and obligations. What to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Friends and acquaintance, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
of Love and Dearness.
What among Kindred, in Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of natural Affection, for their
nearness, their deserts, or their wants.
And what to himself, for so I more
especially call that which is given to
Religious or Pious uses, since these
works follow him, and these layings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107394:10"/>
out go along with him, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
and repaid in a better
place. Such as are, all gifts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
when he had wrong'd or
defrauded any Persons; of equitable
compensation, where he has taken
too great advantage of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
wants or weakness, and been
too hard upon them, and made too
great advantage of them, in Bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Dealing; of Charity or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
in Gifts or Settlements on the
Poor and Needy, or for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
and promotion of piety.
To settle Accounts in Dealing,
what he ows, or what is owing unto
him; what he has in his hands in trust
for others, and what he has left in
their hands, or in trust with them.</p>
               <p>For this disposal, he must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
is the Farewel he takes of all
the World. And when he is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with Kindred and Relations,
Friends and Benefactors, Servants
and Dependants, Chapmen and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers,
Poor and Rich, Sacred and
Secular Persons; a Wise and Good
Man, who has carryed it well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them all his Life, should think
of continuing to do the same, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107394:11"/>
supplying of former Defects, at his
Death, and study to take a fair, and
Friendly, and decent leave of all.
Especially to carry it as becomes
him towards God, and in this great
disposal of all his Goods, to look at
him the Soveraign Donor of them.</p>
               <p>And to do all this with discretion,
and to a Man's satisfaction, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
consideration. And therefore
is like to be best dispatch'd, whilst
the Person hath both Ability and
Leisure for it. And accordingly is
always most providently, and is like
to be most perfectly settled, in time
of Health: However in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Sickness, e're Nature is
weak, and Time is short, or a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
is come to Extremities.</p>
               <p>When all his Worldly cares and
concerns are thus settled and laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
having taken this leave of the
World, he may give himself up to
the Will and good Pleasure of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, to dispose of him either in
Life or Death, and make his Sickness
end either in Health or Heaven, as
he sees will make most for the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
good and for his own Glory.</p>
               <p>If the Physitians are called in to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107394:11"/>
take care of his Body, 'tis fit he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their advice with meekness
and thankfulness, and willingly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and submit himself to their whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and Reasonable Directions. A
Prudent and Compassionate Physitian,
will be tenderly and conscientiously
careful of his ease, so far as that is
consistent with the Care of his Health.
Especially he will consider well, how
he proposes, and much more how he
presses any Medicine, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
has an Antipathy against, and
which is found greatly to disorder
him, tho' it generally relieve others.
And when he sends for him, he must
put his Body into his Hands under
God, and willingly take such Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and submit to such Rules and
Restraints, as he Judges needful for
his Safety, or for the Recovery of
his Health: and not order and tell
his Physitian what he shall prescribe
to him, nor weary him out with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to let him have what he
himself fancies, tho' the other thinks
it would be to his prejudice.</p>
               <p>And these prescriptions of the
Physitian he must use, with looking
up to God in the first place, for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107394:12"/>
good effect of all Medicines; and
without fretfulness and accusations of
the means and methods, if, by the
pleasure of God, the Disease increase
and grow more troublesom in spight
of all Remedies; and without being too
eagerly desirous of Life or ease, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
God please; thanking his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
for the ease which he studies,
but at the same time submitting to
God for the Pains which he sends.</p>
               <p>And let him still remember, to
make fervent Prayers one ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in all his Medicines, considering,
that since it is God who works cures,
Prayers are as necessary thereto as
any thing else. He must not like
Asa,<note n="†" place="margin">2 Cron. 16. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>set God a side when he seeks to the
Physitians;</hi> but expect all the Cure
from Gods blessing, and when it
comes, give him the chief Honour
and Praise for the same, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that the Prayers of pious
Friends have been among the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
of his Medicines.</p>
               <p>If it be thought needful or profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for the body some times at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,
especially in slow and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
diseases, to divert his spirits,
let it not be by reading Plays or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107394:12"/>
Romances, or foolish and undue Ideas
of Love and Honour, which feed or
revive vain thoughts; nor by Play
or other things, fit to excite Passion,
or exercise Covetousness: but in
pastimes of least lightness, and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
temptations, and used with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
remembring that on a sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
when a mans time is almost
spent, 'tis not for him to cast about
how to pass away his time, but how
to redeem and improve it.</p>
               <p>Let the reading which is read to
him, and the conversation which is
held with him, be suitable to one in
his condition. Not light, to lessen
his seriousness; nor in any thing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
uttering things either against
Modesty, or against Piety, or against
Justice, or against Charity: All
which may either leave ill impressions
upon him, by giving his spirit a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the same; or bring him into
a snare, by thinking that he has been
wanting in reproof thereof, out of
too little respect to God, and too
much to the speakers; by either of
which, he is the worse for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107394:13"/>
But let all that passes be fit, to suit
the seriousness, and preserve the
innocence, and help on some virtues,
but hinder none, that are befitting a
Person in his condition: Whereof I
shall say more in the ensuing dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

Sometimes, indeed, the Surprize of
Dying Persons is so great, that they
must leave these things to others.
And sometimes the Persons intrusted,
are fit to serve the Dying Persons
ends, and really do serve them, to
advantage. But this is not ordinarily
to be trusted to, if he can help it. For
why should he think they will make
more dispatch, or find fewer delays
and put offs in doing these things for
him, than he did in doing them for
himself? He has a quicker sense of
his own burdens, and of his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and longings, than another
ordinarily can, or will have: and
if for all that, he shall delay to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden

when he may, why may not they

               <p>But, if formerly they have been
persons of sincere Consciences, in

than an unsettlement of Belief ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Arguments. And then, these
new doubts and suspicions are to be
looked on by the Sick Man, rather
as Temptations, and an advantage
taken of his present feebleness and
lowness of Spirit, which may raise

lament, and bewail them.</p>
               <p>My Heart, O! Prince of Peace,
is with them, who love to see those

Resignation, Thankfullness.</head>
               <p>AFter the Sick Person has taken
this first and chief care for
his Soul, to make its peace for
past or present Offences; his
next care for it must be, to
keep it from falling into any
new Diseases, or that under the
burden of a Sick Body, his Soul do
not fall Sick too. As it will do, if it
grows secure and careless of Duty,
or regardless of Mercies, or is gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Life, and finds no relish in
Prayers, or in discourses of another
World, and falls into impatience,
and is fretted with fleshly cares, and
worldly desires: all which, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107394:19"/>
the like, show his Spirit to be more
distempered, and more dangerously
ill, than his Body is.</p>
               <p>To prevent this, his next care for
his Soul, must be to <hi>order his Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
well under his Sickness,</hi> or to bear
the pains and weakness of his Sick
bed, with <hi>Trust in God,</hi> with <hi>Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to his will,</hi> with <hi>Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and with <hi>Patience to the end.</hi>
Which Duties, tho' they are all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
under the former Head, <hi>viz.</hi> of
<hi>making of his Peace;</hi> yet I shall now
consider and treat of them, as they
are necessary and of greatest use, to

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> he must set himself to bear
them, with <hi>Trust in God.</hi> The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
and uneasiness of his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
will still alarm his fears, and
try his Faith; and it must be his
care, to shew no anxious or distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoughts under them. But as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as any accidents or prospects
terrifie him, let him remember,
that they are all in God's Hands, and
shall have such end only as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
That he who sends them, will
take care they go no further than
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107394:20"/>
'tis fit they should, and will turn
them to the best at last. That he is
Safer and better in God's keeping and
ordering, than he could be in his
own; and therefore may lay aside
all painful and mistrustful cares for
himself, as knowing under all that
happens how sure he is to be taken
care of.</p>

Our Wills, O! Father, are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                     <p>Thou knowest best, O! Lord,
when it was fit for me to come into

me to leave it, and what part is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

                     <p>Lord, I am not only contented,

Yea, when my pains and Distresses

But when I desire it, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe

also sees it fitting. And I know, O!
Lord, that thou art ready to grant

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he must set himself to
bear his sick bed Sorrows, with <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</hi>
We must not think it strange,
or that things are strained too high,
when we are called upon to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
under Sickness, or other Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
For the difference, between
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107394:24"/>
thankful, and unthankful or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
Natures, lyes more in
their Spirits, than in their outward
circumstances. A thanful, Spirit,
will find enough to give God thanks
for, on a Sick-bed or in any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
And an unthankful Spirit,
will never want matter enough to
complain of, in a better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And if any afflicted or Sick
persons, are unthankful, it is not
because they want Mercy's good
store, which deserve their thanks,
but because they overlook them.</p>
                     <p>This Virtue of thankfulness to
God, as it is one of the most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Duty's, so is it one of the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Beauties, and brightest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Sick-bed. For it speaks
true Humility, when we shew, as
we do thereby, that the least Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's
deserve our thanks, and that
the worst States, which God puts
us into, are too good for us. And
it expresses intire good will and
Love to God, when we can love
and praise him even whilst he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
and smites us, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all his Kindnesses in the midst
of our afflictions, and place an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107394:25"/>
belief and confidence in his
Love, that by all these Sorrows he
is doing us good, and deserves our
thanks, tho' in our weak reason we
are not able to see the good which
is to accrue to us thereby.</p>
                     <p>And to preserve in himself this
excellent virtue of thankfulness to
God, let the Sick person set himself
thro all the course and contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of his Sickness, Diligently to
mark and seek out, what may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his thanks, and not, as is too
often done, what may minister to
complaints. Let him pick out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing, and out of every acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that befalls him, what he may
speak well of God for; and let those
be the things, which he reflects on
within himself, and discourses of to
others. And under any pain or
weakness, let him often say.</p>
                     <p>Lord, under all my Sorrows, I
have nothing to accuse, but much to
give thee thanks for.</p>
                     <p>I suffer less, yea, infinitely less,
than I deserve; Blessed be thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for spareing me. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Sufferings. O! Lord, are not
only Justly deserved, but they are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107394:25"/>
needful also to do me good, and
such as thou wilt turn to good;
Blessed by thy name, for seeking
and compassing my benefit thereby.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when my Ailments come,
they want many aggravations, which
would make them a great deal worse
to be born. And are attended with
many seasonable helps and comforts,
to ease and strengthen my Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them.</p>
                     <p>My evils are tolerable evils; Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be thy Pity and Tenderness, for
considering, not what I should Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
but what I can bear to suffer.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes, O! Lord, by thy
Grace I have ease, and relish world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforts.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes I take sweet sleep, and
rest from my Pains and Labours, and
awake with great refreshment.</p>
                     <p>And under all my pains and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
by thy mercy I have some to
Help me, and more to Pity and Pray
for me. I find support, and thou
still seasonably refreshest my Spirit,
from within or from without. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107394:26"/>
be thy name, for these Helps and
Comforts under my Distress. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou often Moderatest and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatest
my pains; and then, tho' they
are a long trouble, they are a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
one.</p>
                     <p>Or, if one Symptom rages, that
is sometimes made a step, to the
ease, or to the Prevention of a
worse.</p>
                     <p>Or, if it is smart, it is not last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but in waiting a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for thee, I still have ease in thy
due Time.</p>
                     <p>Blessed be thy Goodness, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is pleased thus to<note n="†" place="margin">Ps. 41. 3.</note>

my Bed in my Sickness.</hi> Amen.</p>
                     <p>And however, if I have less ease,
and more sorrows now at present,
yet, O! my God, I have the Blessed
Hopes of Rest and Joy to come.
And I can never Bless thee enough
for the Comforts of Hope, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Patient and Short endurance of
my Portion of Evil things here, I
shall be taken to the everlasting
Happiness of thy Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:107394:26"/>
Moreover, O! Lord, I receive
my Bodily Sorrows, as Medicines to
my Soul, to cure my Spirit, and call
me back to thee when I have gone
astray.</p>
                     <p>I Bless thee, for all the lowly

and for all the discovery which I
make of my own Errors thereby.
<hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>And if I want Health, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

               <head type="sub">Of Patience under Sickness. With

                  </gap>se of a Sick-bed,
is a tryal of Patience.
And when 'tis tryed thereon, we
must give good proof thereof, or
else we can never act our Part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably,
nor approve our Selves.</p>
               <p>And if we have the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
virtues, we shall have Patience.
For if we dare trust God, our Fears
of Pain, or other evil accidents,
will not make us unquiet. If our
wills are resigned to his, we shall
not be unwilling to bear what he
sends, but meet our Sorrows with
humble and contented Submission,
instead of angry and uneasie Repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107394:28"/>
If we are thankful to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Sickness, we shall bless him
for what we have, and not discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
complain for what we
want; and thank him because he
once gave, instead of accusing him,
because now he has taken away.</p>
               <p>And therefore when God calls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Person to be Sick, let him look
on Patience, as the Proper virtue of
his State, and make it his care at
every turn to arm his Soul with it.</p>
               <p>Let him set himself to Bear his
Pains and weakness, with gravity
and Composedness, keeping back
from all Passionate, and from all light
and vain words.</p>
               <p>And to bear all, out of Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Resignation to the Will of
God, quietly Suffering because he
sends them.</p>
               <p>And let him remember always, to
humble himself under the hand that
Smites him, and own 'tis just.</p>
               <p>And to kiss the Rod, and confess
'tis for his good.</p>
               <p>And to receive the Strokes with
quietness, and suffer without striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and bear them without unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
complaints of them, and wait on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107394:28"/>
God without fainting, and not sink
under his Load, but support and stay
himself upon God, till his time
comes to send ease.</p>
               <p>He must not shew anger and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness
with his Disease or with his
Medicines, with his food, or with
his Attendance.</p>
               <p>Nor fall to feign reasons of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
things ill, where really there
are none; nor aggravate them,
where there are; nor be hasty in his
Suspicions or Censures, of things
made for him, or of persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
with him, and thereby grow
anxious, and Angry, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to himself and others.</p>
               <p>Nor Expose himself, or Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
the By-standers, by making Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
which are not too heavy to
be born at present, intolerable to
himself, by Pusilanimous Desponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or Anxious fears and mistrusts,
of what they will be in a little time.</p>
               <p>Indeed, his Bodily weakness and
uneasiness, may many times excuse
his forgetfulness and Surprizes in
these Points, both to God and men,
if afterwards he shews himself sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of them, and Sorry for them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107394:29"/>
and doth not indulge them. But
he must not give way, or lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
open to them, and much less
justifie them, or hope to remove

                  </gap>t and Blame of these Sins
from off his Soul, and lay them upon
the Distemper of his Body.</p>
               <p>And instead of blaming and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating,
the Heaviness of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
or the Negligence of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
or Gods Orderings, let
him fall to blame his own impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and to tax his own folly, which
had not learnt before to expect such
crosses as now Disquiet him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to bear them.</p>
               <p>As for Restlessness of Body, and
frequent changes of Place or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
and turning from side to side,
and Sighs, and Groans, and other
unquietness of Body, without any
Disturbance of Spirit, they are not
to be accounted I conceive for Acts
of impatience, and if they can divert
the Pains of sick Persons, or give ease
to their Bodies, I think they need
be no matter of Scruple to their
mindes.</p>
               <p>This Tryal of Patience, indeed,
is an hard Tryal, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107394:29"/>
a constant and a watchful care.
And it may be a great help to him
therein, if among those, who are
pleased to express their kindness,
and do him Comfort, by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and Friendly attendance, he
can chuse a Discreet and Pious Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervisor
of his carriage, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

his Sickness, and desire him to be
his Admonisher, where Excess of
Pain and weariness makes him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
himself, and receive his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Admonitions with willingness
and Thankfulness.</p>
               <p>And under all the uneasiness of
his Sickness, and Temptations to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,

God, for suffering our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

suffer his Patience to be tryed.</p>
               <p>That we are not to think much,
at suffering Tryals deservedly, and
for our selves; when he refused not
to suffer infinitely Greater, without
having deserved to suffer any thing
himself, but merely in Pity and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for others, yea for his Enemies.</p>
               <p>Let him be reminded, that God
has made Pain the way to pleasure,
and that Jesus bore pains before he
was fixed in ease.</p>
               <p>That if the present pains are sad,
Eternal pains are infinitely sadder,
and that we need these here, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our falling under those here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
And instead of repineing,
that we are left still to suffer the
pains of this world; let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and give God thanks, that
we are delivered by his Mercy, and
our Blessed Saviour's merits, from
the endless and insupportable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish

vital Breath, and should constantly

be sent up to God, whilst he has Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
left to offer them.</p>
               <p>Let him be frequently enjoying
the Prayers of the Church, from the
Minister, or others.</p>
               <p>And any of the Prayers hereafter
following, for particular Graces, or
for any of his Particular needs or
desires; not burdening himself with
too many Prayers, or too long ones
at once, but taking them as his
Strength or Time Serves; or as
employing his thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
to exercise not to burden
them.</p>
               <p>And when he is kept from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and using them himself; let
such of them, as he likes or desires,
be read to him by his Friends, for
him to follow, and put up to God
with Holy desires.</p>
               <p>And when he wants leisure, or
Strength for longer, let him distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
minutes, or the small Portions
of his time, with shorter Petitions
and Ejaculations.</p>
               <p>He may be often affectionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
the Lords Prayer. Or any
Particular Petitions thereof, as <hi>thy

Kingdom come; thy will be done in Earth

up, from his own Memory, or
the Reading of his friends; or any
others, which his own mind, or their
Discourses, shall supply him with.</p>
               <p>And let the sweet name of Jesus,
be often in his mouth, but oftner in
his Heart: and let him think that the
Blessed name of a Saviour, cannot
be to much upon the Soul, or too
deep in the desire of a lost Sinner.</p>
               <p>Let him therefore say, Jesu have

               <p>And that he may still be sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with matter for such devout

thoughts and Ejaculations, when he

Scriptures, Hymns, or Prayers, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
discribed for the use of Sick
Persons: or some conveuient Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of the Penitential Psalms; or
something about the Sufferings of

profitable Discourse, concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
or Patience, or Trust in
God, or Thankfulness, or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Death, and Judgment, Heaven,
or Hell.</p>
               <p>Let their Discourses also be Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and minister thoughts fit for the
Seriousness, or for the Comfort or
Service of men, who look upon
themselves, as taking leave of this
World, and going to meet their
Lord.</p>
               <p>Let them seek to Spiritualize ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
and take occasion from all
that happens, to raise up the Sick
mans thoughts to devout and Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Reflexions, So that he may not
want the offer of a good thought,
as oft as he is free and ready for it.</p>
               <p>If he awakes more easie, let them
Bless God for the ease, and observe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107394:35"/>
how Tenderly he proportions Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
to our weakness, considering
what we can bear, as a Tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth. How seasonably he
sends Relief, and how sweetly we
relish it after sharp Sorrows, and
how from their Experience of the
Seasonableness of his Succour in this
case, they should learn to trust him,
if he sends upon them more Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and quietly to wait for him,
hoping he will not stay then, more
then he has done now, past the due
Time.</p>
               <p>Or if he awakes under more pain
and disturbance, let them fuggest to
him, that if tis great, 'tis like to
be the shorter; that God knows best,
how much, and how long we can
bear; that he is in good and merciful
hands, whilst he is in his, and should
be quiet under them; that he must
wait on God, who loves to be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, and Loves to try Faith and
Trust, before he recompence it with
the desired Blessing.</p>
               <p>On all occasions, of any Benefits
received, either by Food, or by
Physick, or by Sleep; and likewise
on any want of them; or on any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107394:35"/>
occurrence or discourse that comes
before them, they will be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and useful Friends indeed, if
they can shew dexterity in raising
up the Devout Sick mans mind to
some Pious thoughts, or virtuous
Resentments or desires about the
same, to make him reflect on the
Power, the Patience, the Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
or the Faithfulness of God;
or upon the Wickedness, and Folly
of men; the vanity of worldly things;
the Serviceableness of Religion, and
Holy affections; the Happy end of
Trust in God; the Temptations and
Dangers of health and ease, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Sickness, the Blessed fruits
of Patience, and the Recompences
that shall crown it at the last.</p>
               <p>And if at any time he Receives not
their Discourses, or their other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
with that Willingness, and Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
which they would expect from
him; let them wait another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and not slacken their good
Offices, but only Study how to time
them better, or make them more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to him on the next occasion;
not taking things ill from him in
this condition, but pitying what
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107394:36"/>
would provoke them at another
time.</p>
               <p>Or if he seems troubled, as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
and kind Natures are apt to be,
that his Disease makes him so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
as he is to his Friends; let
them suggest to him, that Friends
are born for Adversity, and to bear
a part of each others troubles. And
that the same wise orderer, who
sends him the trouble of his Pains
and Sickness, sends them also the
Trouble of their Attendance, and
doth equally expect a willing and
cheerful Reception of their Respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Troubles from both.</p>
               <p>And in the Visits they pay the
Sick, let not the Desire they have
of seeing him, make them any ways
incommodious, or uneasie to him.
Sometimes Sick Persons can ill bear
noise; or would be troubled, not
relieved, by the Presence of others;
or when their Spirits are a little
freer, and more refreshed, having
but little time, or free thoughts
left, they woud have them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and can ill Complement
them away to please others. And
'tis not for wise and kind Friends
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107394:36"/>
to break in upon them, when they
would be alone; but only when their
company would be acceptable, or
may be Helpful to them.</p>
               <p>And besides all the Prayers, and
devout Thoughts, which he puts up
thus for himself, let him also desire
the Prayers of others. Let him send
to desire the Prayers of the publick
Congregation. And if he send Almes
at the same time, good prayers will
be more like to prevail for him.
And when he takes his leave of any
Friendly Visitants, let him desire
them to remember him in theirs;
shewing thus on all occasions, that
his Eye is unto God in all his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and that he looks to reap most
benefit from good prayers.</p>
               <p>And by such ways and thoughts as
these, may the sick person set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to this <hi>second</hi> part of his Task,
viz. <hi>The bearing of his Pains and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with Patience, Resignation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
Thankfulness</hi> and <hi>Trust in God,</hi>
and such Resentment of things, and
Reflections on them, as are fitting
for a sick Bed.</p>

I have been hitherto speaking. A
Dying Man is not distinguished from
a sick Man, by the difference of his
Habits, but only by a greater care and
exactness in putting of them on. The
same Thoughts and Desires befit him;
but when he is expiring, he would be
glad, if his strength will serve, to
send them up in a brighter and a
hotter flame. So that when he comes
to die, he must hold on the same Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
of Repentance, Patience,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107394:37"/>
Faith, Thankfulness, Devotion, and

do, or else be content and rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

               <p>And let him welcome Death when

If the Dying persons have lived ill
and loosly, they have Reason indeed,
if God please, to desire to live longer,
that they may learn to live better,
and may be more perfect before they
Die. Yea, and even good persons
do many times desire the same, since
the best may mend, and still grow
better.</p>
               <p>But let such good Souls think with
themselves, that if they should live
longer, yet living on in the same
frail Natures, peradventure more
days would still heap up more Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Infirmities to make them
still more afraid of Death; and they
would be more imperfect, and less
fit to die then, than they are now.
So that 'tis best to let God chuse for

pleases.</p>

God to remember the same for their
Benefit. And let him heartily beg
their pardon, for all the Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or passionate, or unequal usage,
which he had ever been guilty of
towards any of them in his Health;
for all the unnecessary trouble, which
he has given to any of them by his

provocation and offence, which he
has given to any of them by his fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness

and impatience, during the

and to warn them against falling

Injoyments of this World, or if at

Repentance, or growing hardened

               <p>Then let him exhort them all to
keep Peace among themselves, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
those who are concerned in
the Division of his Estate; And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire

his Agonies. And so recommend
them all to God's Mercy, praying
that he will keep them all stedfast in
his fear, and safe under his care,
whilst they live; and give them all
comfort, when they come into his
condition; and bring them all at
last, to meet together again in his
Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>After this, he may tell those
Friends, who attend more about him,
that in his departure, he desires he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:107394:40"/>
may have no disturbance to lengthen
out his Pains, and molest his Passage.
And therefore if any of them think
they cannot contain themselves, and
govern their Grief, nor see him Die
without bursting into passionate Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys
and noisie disturbance, to call
back his retiring Spirit, let him beg
them to withdraw when his Death
approaches, and pray for him and
vent their own grief by themselves.
But if any of them can stand by, and
accompany him in silence, if they
happen then to be about him, he may
desire that they would stay to assist
him with their Prayers in his last A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies,
and recommend his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul to God at his last Breath.</p>
               <p>After he hath taken such Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

               <p>AS soon as the Dying Person
has breathed his last, his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
Friends, especially they whom
he has intrusted with the care and
Disposal of his Body, must be very
careful to Dress, and treat it De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently,
till it be Decently interr'd.</p>
               <p>Let it not lye too open to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries
of the Curious, nor let any
thing of it be exposed, which the
Person if alive would blush at.</p>
               <p>If he gave Orders for his own Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
those Orders are a Trust,
which are Religiously to be observed.
But if he has left it to them, they
must Order the same, with as Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
a Regard to his circumstances
and worldly Estate, and with as
much Decency, and wise expression
of Love and Respect to him, as they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107394:42"/>
can. And lay out what is fit, in
Dressing out the Body, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it; in shewing Respect and
Kindness, where he bore them, or
where he ought them; and in Doles
and Deeds of Charity, to the Poor
and Needy.</p>
               <p>In these layings out, they should
not spend more than is meet, nor
lavish any thing away, vainly, or
imprudently.</p>
               <p>And on the other Hand, they
need not Scruple, some well chosen
instances of expence, which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Honorary than useful, if there
be Estate enough to bear them, and
good Reason for them, and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Discretion shown in them.
For tho' this cost doth the <hi>Poor no
Good,</hi> as <hi>Judas</hi>

it expresses their Love, and Respect
to the Dead: and such expressions of
esteem and kindness to them, who
have Greatly deserved it, and can
now make no more Returns of it, are
Religious and well approved of both
by God and Men. Our Blessed Lord

seriously affected, with their own or

as there is just cause; however,
with the loud Warning and Alarm
to themselves, which is in these
Providences.</p>
               <p>Let them not talk lightly, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly,
nor fall into Discourses of
News, or Markettings, or of other
Worldly business.</p>
               <p>For these neither suit with the
Friendly Sadness, nor with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Seriousness of that occasion,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107394:43"/>
and shew them to be little touched,
either with their Friends Death, or
with Thoughts and Expectations of
their own.</p>
               <p>But instead thereof, let them study
each to employ themselves, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Company, with Thoughts
and Discourses, about the Vanity, and
uncertainty of all earthly Things;
about the Sorrows, and benefits of
Sickness; about the Troublesome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Shortness of Life, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
that we shall all Dye, and the
uncertainty of the Time when, and
the Suddenness many Times of these
Changes, and the Great need we all
have constantly to expect, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for them; and about the Hopes
and Blessedness there is in Dying well,
and the Happiness of that State
where we shall Dye no more, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have the Loss of any Dear
Friends to Mourn for.</p>
               <p>They may also Discourse of their
Deceased Friends, especially when
they have things to say of them to
their Advantage: As how their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
was tryed, and approved in
their Sickness; how good God was
to them, and how Submissive, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107394:44"/>
Devout they were towards him,
what Good words they said, or Good
works they did, or Comfort and
Support they found; or any thing
else belonging to them, either Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Dying, for which they are fit
to live in our Memory, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
for our instruction or imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>And when they come thus, to take
up Good and Heavenly Thoughts,
and to infuse them into one another,
they will do Great Good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as well as Honour to their
Friend, by paying him this last Office,
and all return better than they came
from the House of Mourning.</p>
               <p>When the Relations and Friends
mourn and shew Decent sorrow for
the Deceased, as 'tis fit they should,
to shew they expect to find a want
of them, or to express their Love,
and value for them, as<note n="†" place="margin">Jo. 11. 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Jesus wept at
Lazarus</hi>'s <hi>Grave,</hi> to show <hi>how he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him;</hi> they must be careful, to Do
it moderately, and Christianly. And
Grieve for him like men, who know
that God has taken him; and who have
hope and comfort in Death, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it; and believe, when a Pious
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107394:44"/>
Friend Dyes, that the living only
have lost, but that the Deceased
has got by Dying. But they must
not repine against God, who has
taken their Friend away; nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
his Care to provide for them,
now their Friend is gone; nor grow
out of Humour, or unthankful for
all his other Mercies, because they
are deprived of this; nor let their
Grief be excessive or obstinate, and
refuse to be comforted,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>as they who
have no Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Particularly, let them <hi>not refrain
going to Church, for such a certain
space of Time, or number of Weeks, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Dear Wife or Husbands Death,</hi>
as the manner of some is; which
I think is a very ill chosen expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Grief, or Ceremony of
Mourning. For this looks, as if we
were out of Humour with God,
because he has taken our Friend
from us; and is very unsuitable, to
that Patience, and Thankfulness,
which we ought to express; and to
that Devotion, which we not only
ought, but need to use, on such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.
For these Changes, should
not make us less Religious, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107394:45"/>
more; and call us to God, and his
House and Service, instead of Driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us from them. The House of
God, is the House of comfort;
and in our affliction, we have the
more need to run to it, to be eased
of our Sorrows, as well as to show
our intire Submission and Service to
that most Wise and good Hand,
which has now Disposed of our
Friend, and in his Due time will
Dispose of us too to his own mercy.</p>
               <p>And as for the Mourning of the
Surviver, when God has this way
parted dear Pairs, the Memory of
the Deceased should not easily wear
off, but stick fast and long with the
Living, as is very fit, both in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Dead, and in Decency
and due Regard to the censure of the
Wise and Sober part of the World.
And unless the Circumstances or
needs of Families, are very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and Pressing for them to
change their condition sooner, they
should at least wait the Time, which
Custom and good Report have fixed
in mourning for the Dead, before
they forget their Sorrows, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to any motions of exchanging
them for new Joys.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:107394:45"/>
Lastly, the Executors and nearest
Relations may still further shew
their kindness and careful Respect,
and Deserve well of their Deceased
Friends, by being very studious to
keep Peace among themselves;
and, if any Clauses of the will are
not clearly worded, or any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
about the Estate are left lyable
to Dispute, by Composing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micably
among themselves without
fuits, that the contentions of the
Living may not spoil or disparage
the Kindness, nor ever be laid by
God, or men, to the Neglect, or
carelessness of the Dead.</p>
               <p>By fulfilling their Wills punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and giving to every one at
their Time, with Good-will, and
without unnecessary trouble, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
what is really intended for
them, and Due to them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>Yea, by having Regard, to what
was fit for them to Order, tho'
they forgot to Order it: Or, what
they needed to Order, but could
not, as Payment of Debts which
they left not Estate enough to pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107394:46"/>
The Law, indeed, will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
them to pay beyond <hi>Assets,</hi> or
what the Deceased has left them
to pay out of. But Natural Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the Virtue of Gratitude,
in near and dear Kindred, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Children towards their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
may call for more than any
humane Law doth.</p>
               <p>For Children have received abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
from their Parents, and if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they see them brought to want,
they ought to look upon themselves
as much in their Debt, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged in Gratitude<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>to requite
them</hi> if they are able, which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
calls <hi>shewing Piety at home.</hi> Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to shew this Piety in doing such
things for them, as they would most
Desire to be done for themselves.
And if these Deceased Relations had
Liberty to speak their own mindes
to us, I belive we should hear, that
nothing lyes nearer to their Hearts,

also to the surviving Relations, how
to discharge their Parts well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Death of Friends.</p>

                  <p>To make his Confessions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Acts of Repentance, with greater
sureness and satisfaction to himself,
the Sick man must first make a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107394:76"/>
of his Sins, by examining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and trying his ways upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Heads and Branches of God's
Commandments. And thereby inquire
into the state of his Soul, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is already safe within the
terms of pardon, or what he wants
to make him so. This is a work, for
all men, at all times, who would live
with safety, or die with peace. But
especially for sick and dying persons,
who are more sensible their case ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of no delays; and who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ought, but also more commonly
are wont to make it their earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and care. And in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this most important
Task, with security and comfort, I
have assisted them as well as I can, in
<hi>the Tryal or Judgment of the Soul,</hi> &amp;c.
in a small Treatise intituled, <hi>A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion

Ignorance, espoused for Earthly

against all the Rebukes and
Strivings of thy Grace, and of my

making thy self a Sin-Offering
for us, art come to take away the
Sins of all, who truly Repent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And, O! Merciful Lord, tho'
my Sins are many and grievous, yet
I do not desire to overlook them, but
would gladly see and discover them
all, that I may penitently bewail and
forsake them. And Oh! That no
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107394:77"/>

left me to repent of them. And as
for those sins, which I do know my
self to be guilty of, I do not cover,
but with shame confess them. I do
not justifie nor excuse, but condemn
my self for the same.</p>
                  <p>I stand thereby guilty, O! Lord,
of highest Disobedience, against the

Disingenuity and Unthankfulness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

for moments of Vanity.</p>
                  <p>I reflect on all this, O! Merciful
God, with bitterness, and with a
Spirit wearied with mine own ways.
I see and lament my own folly, and
abhor mine own vileness on account
thereof. I wish with all my Soul,
that those Sins had never been done,

them, and most earnestly desire, and

thy Will, O! Blessed Lord, be
done. Thy Will be done, because it is
thine; and because thou art my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and nothing can come to me
from thee, but what is very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with a Fathers Tenderness and
Affection.</p>
                  <p>Thy will be done, because thou
knowest best what to chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e for me;
and because I am well assured, that
to refer all my matters to thy Choice,
is the best care I can take for my
self. For in thy Choice, thou hast
not less kindness, but only more
knowledge, Care, and Providence,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107394:90"/>
than I can have in chusing for my
self.</p>
                  <p>For as for me, O! my God, I
know that I am ignorant, and whilst
I live in this world, shall be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
what things thereof, or what
States and Conditions therein, are
most desireable for my Self, or for my
Friends. I am foolish in my wishes,
too oft opposing that, which is most
safe for me, and which is fit, or it
may be needful to do me good: and
as often coveting that, which is full
of Danger, and like to do me hurt.
And therefore I renounce my own
Will, which is blind and foolish, and
which if I could have it, would too
often be to my sorrow and prejudice.</p>
                  <p>And instead of that, I refer my
self wholly to be guided and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of by thine, which never errs,
and is always for my real welfare
and advantage. And my desire is,
not that my foolish wishes, but that
thy unerring Wisdom, may at all
times prescribe me and mine our
Portion. I trust to thine All-seeing
eye, to direct what is best; and to
thy Fatherly love and care, to allot
it for us. And where I do not see
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107394:90"/>
how any Orderings of thine, should
work for mine, or for my Families,
or Friends good; yet, Lord, I will
believe that thou doest, and that all
is both wisely, and kindly appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us, because it is thy doing,

more abundant hopes in the Life to
come, That 'tis best for thy Will,
to take place of mine, and to chuse

                  <p>O! Most Gracious and Merciful
God, I receive this sickness
as thy Monitor, to put me upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
and amending the Errors of
my Life, and on making preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for my Death.</p>
                  <p>And let no flattering hopes of life,
O! Lord, delay or slacken my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
or keep me from setting
my Soul in order. But give me Grace
to make use thereof, as if I were sure
it would be, what for ought I know
it may be, a Sickness unto Death.
And therefore let me now begin,
to repent of all my sins with that
exactness, as he should do who
thinks this is like to be the last time.
And to order all my Actions with
that uprightness and holy care, as
befits him who is going to give
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107394:106"/>
an account of them. And to be
so perfect in putting on all the Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of a Religious Spirit, as he who
expects to have no place afterwards
for filling up any Omissions.</p>
                  <p>And on my Sick-bed, Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
let Holy Prayers be my Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
and Delight. And make
me look on shewing Patience, and
exercising Faith, and perfecting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
to be my business, for
those remaining moments, which I
have still to spend on earth. Oh!
Let me have as little to do with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and as much intercourse with
thee my God, and exercise of all
Heavenly Thoughts and Virtues, as
I can; that being used to that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Employment of Beatified Spirits,
I may be fit for their Society, and
prepared everlastingly to injoy thee
in Glory, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Glory it is to bring good out
of evil, and Light out of Darkness,
turn my sickness, which comes as the
punishment of my sins, into the
means of my obedience. Make it the
instrument of thy Grace to bring me
to my self, and to call me off from
Sin and Folly, which have been the
Parents of all our pain and misery.
Let it bring Innocence and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to my Spirit, and peace and
comfort therein; and then my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
shall pass for Favours, and I
will give thee thanks and praise for
my Correction.</p>
                  <p>When it wasts and brings down
my Spirits, O! Father, cause it also
to tame and bring down my Passions,

And let the sense of my wants
and weakness, cure me of all Self-Confidence,
and carry me out whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to depend on thee. Under the
Terrors of thy Power, possess me
with holy awe and fear. And whilst
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:107394:107"/>
my pains make me forgetful of other
things, let me not remember the
wrongs I have received, nor be high
in resentments of them</p>
                  <p>Let the dulness also of my Senses,
O God, mortifie all Carnal Appetites,
and the unsavoryness of all worldly
Vanities, cure me of all inordinate
fondness for them. Oh! Make my
love of Earthly things, and all my
sinful Lusts and Self-esteem to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, and let my Sickness kill
them, and save my Soul alive.</p>
                  <p>And grant, O! Lord, that the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
which I find there is in wanting
thy Mercies, may keep me duly sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of them, and thankful for them,
whilst I enjoy them. And let the
feeling of these Sorrows in my self,
touch me with Pity and Compassion
for the Sufferings of others, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
I see them exercised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p>And make me ever think, O! Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father, that I get more in being
thus made better and wiser by my
Afflictions, than in being deliver'd
from them: And count nothing so
good for me, as to be brought thus
to know my self, and to know and

serve thee, and to be put in the sure
way of obtaining thine everlasting
Mercy, thro my most Blessed Lord

us our weakness, nor calls more for

of my sweet Babe, which has
done nothing against thee, will call
aloud to thy mercy to deliver me.
Thou art ready to hear us, and to
help us, O! Lord, because of thy
Promise. And my Trust is, that
thy Power and Goodness will not be
wanting to support and deliver me
in this Case, because I see thou daily
dost extend the same to support and
deliver others; [and because thou

I do not in the least complain of thee

                  <p>For they had taken me off, O!

mind Worldly Pomp and show, and
to fix themselves in Clay. They were
grown greedy and unsatisfied in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

being Blind, rather than having

                  </p>
                  <p>So that I humbly submit to this
Blindness, O! my God, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And if it be thy Pleasure to have me

not only submit to thee, but will still
thankfully adore and praise thy

to have less danger from it. For in

first dispatch'd such Business and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,

was come to have much less need

the Lust of my Eyes. And let me by

them the first inlets of Death too.</p>
               <p>And since my Eyes are kept from

busie themselves at home, in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

others may, that I am still called off

               <p>And make me remember, O! my

thee, is to see with Angels eyes.
And that altho' Flesh and Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see God, yet Faith doth. And
that whilst thou art pleased to clear
up my Faith which is the eye of my
Soul, and to make it strong and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to discern what will please thee,
and what will save and comfort me
in the next World; it matters less
tho' I remain dark, to what is apt
to insnare and afflict me in this

               <p>And whilst I want my Eyes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me at every turn what passes,

I may give the more heed when I

dishonour thee, and corrupt me.
And where they were less bent upon
evil, yet however they were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thou art just in stopping them,
because I have misused them; and I
must clear and glorifie thee in taking
away my Hearing from me, both in
deserved Punishment of my having
provoked thee, and in careful Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of my further corruption of
my self thereby.</p>
               <p>But, Lord, in thy just Displeasure,
remember Mercy, and open mine
Ears again if it may seem good to
thee. For I acknowledge my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Errors, and am resolved by thy
Grace, to keep them always open to
good words, and averse to evil. Do
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107394:132"/>
thou open them, good Lord, for to
thee alone do I look for the same, and
I know it is as easie for thee to open
them, as it was to shut them. And
consider no longer my Sins, which
deserve to be punished, but mine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which calls to be pityed.</p>
               <p>For by this Deafness, O! my God,
I am deprived very much of the

to me, because I am deaf to them,
and can seldom let in any Voice, that
might bring Counsel or Comfort, to
my Soul or to my Body.</p>
               <p>Oh! therefore, Holy Father, do
thou once more restore me to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

                  <p>BUt altho by thy Grace, I am now
recover'd, O! Almighty Lord,
from this Sickness; yet I know that
at thy time, I must expect to be sick
again, and shall surely Dye, and I
know not how soon that time may
come. And I have found how much
need there is under the Terrors of
Death, to be conscious to our selves
of having lead a truly Religious and
upright Life, and how unfit we are
to begin it under the Weaknesses of
that State. Oh! then that my chief
Care may allways be to live with
such Good Conscience, as I should
be willing to Dye with; and to doe
all those things in the time of my
Health and Strength, which I shall
surely wish I had Done when my last
weakness and sickness comes.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, O! my Dear God,
I humbly and earnestly Pray thee,
that I may never fall to admire, or
grow fond of any of the things of
this world, by coming again to relish
and enjoy them. Let me never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
the Wealth of the Covetous, nor
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:107394:144"/>
the Honours and High Places of the
ambitious, nor the Sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Licentious men. For these
things, O! Lord, can not profit me
in the Days of Evil. They are vane
Things, that pass off in the useing,
and leave nothing but remorse and
and Guilt behind them. And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of them at the Approach
of Death, instead of affording ease
and Comfort, will be the greatest
wound and weakning to my Spirit,
and increase my pains and Terrors,
instead of any ways asswaging them.</p>
                  <p>Nor suffer me, O! God, to trifle
away this time of Respite in things
of noe benefit, which doe thee noe
Honor, and my poor Soul noe Good.
For either to hide my Talents, or to
misemploy them, will inflame the
reckoning of my Sins: And that will
turn this great Blessing, of lengthning
out my Days, into a Curse; and
make my latter end worse, than my
beginning was.</p>
                  <p>But give me Grace, O! Father,
to Redeem those Precious Hours,
which I have formerly thrown away
on vice or vanities, by employing all
this small Remainder of my time, in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107394:144"/>
seeking thy Glory, and in carefully

that which I hope doth highly please
him, displease me; nor let me refuse
Comfort, because I trust he is taken

Saints and Angels, and the Envy and

taken up to a State where they can
not tempt, and to an Happiness
which is for ever Denyed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Oh! then that I may not
joyn with his utter Enemyes and
mine, in their Envy, but with those
Blessed Spirits in their Charity; and

not to be tormented with any long
Fears thereof. And that the sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the stroke was, the less he was
like to feel it. Or should he have
felt it more, yet he might not have
felt a painfull Disease less, had it
been his Executioner. For altho that
would have been more slow, it might
not have proved less Cruel; nor have
smarted lighter, but only lasted long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

Capable to understand them. And
that if it Stayed not here to enjoy

it and fright it at thy Judgement.
By thy Mercy, O! Father, it Stayed
till it was received for thine own
Child by Baptism, and was therein
assured by thee of remission of Sin,
and made an Heir of thy Kingdom.
And by the same Mercy it is now
Call'd away, ere it had done any
