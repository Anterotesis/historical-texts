            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And O that this might be viſited by the Lord, Wherever it is, and kept alive to

Is it not the Truth as it is in Jeſus; the inward Truth, which hath Virtue and Power in it, to work againſt and work out that which is contrary to Truth, and ſo deliver and free the Mind from it? For the Light, which is Truth, can expel Darkneſs; the Life which is Truth, can overcome Death; yea, the Truth which is living, holy and righteous, can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſubdue the unholy and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature, and break down the ſtrong Holds, and bring every rebellious and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Thought into Captivity and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>John</hi> 8. 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 20, 21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>Q 19. How doth God cauſe the Children of the New Covenant to walk in his Statutes and keep his Judgments and do them?

Haſt thou eat and drunk the Bread, Wine and Milk which thoſe waters yield? Haſt thou been abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of God's houſe, and hath he given thee to drink of the River of his Pleaſure? Hath the Lord open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Ear in thee to hear as the learned? And haſt thou inclined thy Ear and come unto him who gives Life, and received him who is Life and gives Life in that inward, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, living Appearance of his in the heart, wherein and whereby he gives Life?

               <p>O how Miſerable is he, who is deceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe things! O how Happy is he, who hath received the true Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, which cannot be deceived; wherein he hath the Evidence and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of God's Spirit concerning them, and knoweth the Truth as it is in Jeſus; as it is in his Life, in his Spirit, in his Power, who miniſters after the Power of an Endleſs Life unto all his Sheep, wo are returned to the Shepherd and Biſhop of the Soul, who hear his Voice and follow him, wherever he goes or leads, who is an eternal Shepherd and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Door of Life to his, and leads to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Paſtures, and ſweet ſtill Sreams of Life, and is giving the ſweet Food, Reſt and pure Pleaſure of Eternal Life unto his abundantly, even as it is his Will, that after their many ſore Trials, Exerciſes and Travels (&amp; Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him therein) they ſhould abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs and enjoy it. Glory to the Lord for ever, whoſe Kingdom is ſet up in the Hearts of many, and who already reigns in the Hearts of many, and will reign in the

            <p>Verſe 10. <hi>WHo is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the Voice of his Servant, that walketh in Darkneſs and hath no Light?</hi> It is rendered in another Tranſlation. <hi>And no Light ſhineth upon him,</hi> (which was <hi>Job's</hi> caſe in his great Affliction, as is ſignified by him, chap. 29. 2. 3.) <hi>Let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſe 11. <hi>Behold all ye that kindle a fire, that compoſs about with ſparks, walk in the light of your own Fire, and in the ſparks ye have kindled, this ſhall ye have of mine Hand, ye ſhall lie down in Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1 DOth not the Tender and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, many times in the Bowels of his Love and Mercy, bring Darks<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs and great Diſtreſs upon mens ſpirits, that they might wait for his Healing and
<pb facs="tcp:36339:9"/>
Redemption? Yea, doth not this befal ſome who fear the Lord, and are found in the holy reverence and obedience to him? And is it not good that it ſhould befal them?</p>
            <p>Q. 2. Should not men in ſuch a condition of Darkneſs and Diſtreſs, truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon him, till he cauſe Light to ariſe out of Obſcurity, and comfort them that mourn in <hi>Zion;</hi> giving them Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for Aſhes, the Oyl of Joy for Mourning, and the Garment of Praiſe for the Spirit of Heavineſs?</p>
            <p>Q. 3. Are not Perſons very proue and liable in time of Darkneſs and Diſtreſs, inſtead of waiting upon God for his Help and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be kindling a fire and compaſſing themſelves about with ſparks?</p>
            <p>Q. 4. Are there not ſome who cannot be content without Heat and Warmth in their Religion and Performances; and yet inſtead of waiting for God's kindling the fire, and his cauſing the ſparks of Life to ariſe, kindle a fire of themſelves; and compaſs themſelves about with ſparks of their own Kindling</p>
            <p>Q. 5. May not men after they have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fire and ſparks; walk in the Light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? And may not God in his juſt Judgment and ſore Diſpleaſure againſt them, leave them to themſelves, and give them up ſo to do?</p>
            <p>Q. 6. What will God do in the end, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36339:9"/>
what in the end ſhall befall them from God, who kindle a fire and ſparks; and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued walking in the Light thereof, and have been heated and warmed thereby? Will not God cauſe them at length to lie down in ſorrow? O that Perſons that are ſerious in Religion, might not thus err, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to give them up, to walk in the Light of the fire and ſparks of their own kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>Q. 7. When do men kindle a fire and ſparks of their own? Do they not firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the God of their Salvation, and become unmindful of the Rock of their Strength? And do they not then, plant pleaſant Plants, and ſet ſtrange Slips? (And where do they plant and ſet them?) But what will the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt be in the Day of Inheritance, when they come to reap and inherit what they have planted and ſown? (For what a man ſo w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that muſt he alſo reap.)

            <p>Q. 8. In what Light do men build up a wall inwardly, and daub it with untempered Morter, to ſecure themſelves from the wrath to come? Is it not in the light of the fire and ſparks of their own kindling? Will any wall
