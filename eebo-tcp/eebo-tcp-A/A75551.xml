            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ARGVMENTS,</hi> Proving that we ought not to part with the <hi>MILITIA, TO THE KING,</hi> Nor indeed to any other, but the Honourable Houſe of COMMONS.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE conceive it is <hi>Treaſon</hi> to our ſelves and ours, to put the lives of Millions, ſo their eſtates and liberties, into the power of one man, <hi>their ſervant,</hi> ſo that the <hi>murthers, rapes, rapines</hi> or <hi>abuſes,</hi> he ſhall commit, by himſelfe, or his, are unavoidable, wee are alſo guilty of them, <hi>for it is to ſell our Birth-rights,</hi> (that is the power of our lives, eſtates and liberties, which is ours by nature) <hi>for a meſſe of Pottage,</hi> or rather for nothing. <hi>Eſau was well paid for his, in compariſon of our ſelves,</hi> for neceſſitated to a famiſhing, <hi>he had ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for ſupport.</hi> Yet what is his <hi>Birth-right</hi> of <hi>Elder-ſhip, to what wee part with,</hi> it was but a point of <hi>Opinion,</hi> not of <hi>Power,</hi> as ours is? But to part with the <hi>Militia,</hi> is to inſlave our ſelves, and ours, to the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Wilfull,</hi> ſo it is the height of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is againſt the law of Nature, reaſon, and humane juſtice, for that he hauing ſuch power in his hand, may overthrow us all, <hi>ad placîtum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is againſt the law and will of God, ſo divine Ordination, that millions ſhould be at the mercy of one man, <hi>their ſervant,</hi> in their lives eſtates and liberties; and therefore God excepts againſt it, and warnes the People againſt it, telling them how their king might abuſe them, by reaſon of his too large betruſted power. <hi>vide,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. <hi>Repented for as a great ſix,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All our lawes then are of no uſe, and all the bloud ſhed, is as water ſpilt upon the ground, loſt to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Quere,</hi> If it ought not to be made treaſon, to bring it in queſtion? For it is conceived, if delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in right words, it is an abſolute betraying of us, quite contrary to betruſt, &amp; the end of government.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Should we connive or conſent at the diſpoſure of it to him it were a treacherous, unnaturall, unjuſt and prophane act in us, and we conceive it the ſame in them that ſhall conferre it on him, ſo in him to deſire it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now becauſe we muſt beſtow it ſomewhere, we cannot conceive where it can be better or ſafer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, then where it is, <hi>many in likelyhood not ſo ſoon agreeing to abuſe us, as one,</hi> we further conceiving, the carefull choyce, and large betruſt of the People, will be a ſtrong tye on them &amp;c. <hi>Therefore we intreat the honourable Houſe of Commons, to confine it within the Confines of their own juriſdiction; and to beſtow it in faithfull hands,</hi> not factious, <hi>ſuch as will not ſubdue all but themſelves, nor indeed any at all, but be in a ready<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſupport all ſuch, (though of different judgments and opinions in Religion) in their rights and priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Had we beſtowed it on him by Law, <hi>that Law were lawleſſe, becauſe deſtructive,</hi> and quite contrary to the end of government, that law then were juſtly breakable, he reſiſtable, and our ſafety revocable. It is a breach of the 6th. Commandement, <hi>and ſelfe-murther, to give power to any to murther us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Yea more, had he bought the power with millions to each individuall, it was an unlawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, <hi>for defence of life is inſt, and iuſtly irrecoverable,</hi> we conclude then as at 7th.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That to give [or debate upon giving] the <hi>Militia</hi> to the King at the end of twenty yeares, is very dangerous, and apt to beget an opinion in the people, that he hath ſome right to it, and that at preſent it is onely kept from him, for his abuſing it, when as in deed and in truth he hath no right at all in the leaſt unto it; neither is it juſt, or reaſonable to betruſt him, or any one ſingle man in the Kingdome with it, <hi>Salus populi</hi> having already run ſuch hazards of an utter ruining, by the <hi>Militia's</hi> being in his ſingle hand, for which he ought, <hi>according to Proteſtations, Oaths, and Covenants,</hi> to be brought to exemplary, &amp; condigne puniſhment, he being the greateſt &amp; moſt notorious Delinquent in the whole Kingdom, yea, the originall fountain and Wel-Spring of all the Delinquents in the Kingdome, giving Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all the reſt, to kill, murther and ſtay the innocent People, whom by oath, duty and office, he ought to have protected; and therefore his ſin and offence more hainous and capitall then any others, yea indeed, then all others that have joyned with him.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Quere,</hi> Whether or no, if the King ſhould have the <hi>Militia</hi> again, then whether indeed, have not the <hi>Scots</hi> the power of it under his name, which onely is uſed to colour the deſign, that ſo they may not be ſeen in it, to deſire and endeavour to be <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Lords</hi> over <hi>England?</hi> But the project por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends noleſſe.</p>
