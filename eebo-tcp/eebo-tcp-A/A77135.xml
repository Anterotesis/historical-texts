         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Few Words to thoſe who look for ANOTHER DISPENSATION than what is known by the Faithful CHRISTIANS in this Day, putting off and ſlighting the preſent Manifeſtation of God unto them, and ſo by their Unfaithfulneſs to the Lord God, in not walking anſwerable to him for his Loving-kindneſs in his preſent Manifeſtation unto them, put the Day of the Lord afar off from them, &amp;c.</head>

               <salute>FRIENDS;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat do you look for? what would you have diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more to you of the things of God's Kingdom, than can be diſcovered and known by the Light you believing in it, and being faithful unto God in what he hath at preſent manifeſted thereby unto you? 'Tis ſaid by one who was acquainted with the Way of the Lord, <hi>In thy Light ſhall we ſee Light;</hi> whoſe Teſtimony is true, as you will be able to witneſs in your own Particulars, by your living up to that Light, in being faithful to the Father of Lights, in what he hath at preſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to you made known. This I ſay to you in the Name of the Lord, Till you are faithful unto him in what he hath at preſent manifeſted or made known unto you, how can you expect to know him, or the things of his Kingdom, any further or more than at preſent you do?</p>
            <p>Therefore do not dream nor imagine of another Diſpenſation, or of God's making more known to you, or manifeſt to you of himſelf, or of the Things of his Glorious Kingdom to your Comfort, than you know thereof at preſent, whilſt you believe not in the Light: If you do, I ſay and declare unto you by the Word of the Lord, you will deceive your own Souls; which thing I deſire you may not do.</p>
            <p>You talk of a further Diſpenſation, and ſo of further Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of the Knowledge of the Glorious God, then they who are faithful to God, in walking or living up to their Light in this Glorious Day of his Appearance are Witneſſes of, or are come to be acquainted withal: but this your Talk is without a true Knowledge of them, or of what they do witneſs, and enjoy, and partake of through the Lord's rich Love and Kindneſs, and Good Will unto their Souls.</p>
            <p>Do you believe that when our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was manifeſt in Fleſh, there were not as wiſe and as ſearching Wits amongſt them that gain-ſayed, ſleighted and oppoſed him, as any are amongſt you, who put the Day of the Lord far away from you, though it be nigh, and the Kingdom of God be at hand? You who ſleight, and diſeſteem, and regard not as you ought the preſent manifeſtation of God unto you; were they not as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Holy, and as blameleſs in their Converſations, and as free from the guilt of Iniquity ſome of them as any or many amongſt you are? And was there not as much ſeeming Holineſs amongſt them as is amongſt you? And yet they knew him not, but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Knowledge of him, and ſo were without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the world and his Wayes, as you are, becauſe they would not come to the Light; though they could ſpeak much of him, as you do.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was not known to the Worldly Wiſe, nor his true Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>The World knoweth us not, becauſe it knoweth him not: And our Life,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> &amp;c. Then why ſhould you in the ſame Wiſdom they were in expect to know Chriſts true followers now any more than they did then? and if you knew the Goſpel Diſpenſation, (as they do whoſe Life from you is hid, who are faithful to the living God in what he hath manifeſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the Word of his Grace (doubtleſs) ye would not talk ſo much, nor look ſo much for another.</p>
            <p>Therefore while you have time prize your time, and ſin not out your Day, leſt utter Darkneſs come upon you and overtake you, and ſo the Night come when you cannot Work, which ſad and woful ſtate and condition many have fallen into, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs many will fall into, if they Repent not: Therefore Pray ye to the God of all Mercies, that ye may eſcape the ſame.</p>
            <p>So Fear and Dread before the living God, and haſten for your Lives, by abandoning and forſaking that Spirit which cauſeth you to ſlight and diſregard the preſent Diſcovery and Manifeſtation of God unto you, and it by which he diſcovereth and manifeſteth his Holy and Heavenly Mind and Will unto your Souls; and ſo would have you to put the Day of the Lord afar off, which Day is near, and ready to be revealed; leſt he overthrow you, as he overthrew thoſe who put his Day afar off in times paſt, who would not be led to Repentance by his Long-ſuffering.</p>
