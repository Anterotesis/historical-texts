            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat there is a weighty Truſt repoſed in you, 'tis no ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me to tell you; for verily the righteous God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the performance of it from you; the right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging whereof is of great concernment (and the hearty deſire of him that ſends this) to you. Never had this Nation ſince ſhe had the Name of <hi>England,</hi> more need of wiſe Senators, then at this ſeaſon; for <hi>England</hi> hath ſinned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly againſt her God, his mercies to her have been of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful magnitude: What people under the Sun hath he dealt ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with? Or is there any Nation under Heaven hath had ſo liberal a portion of the bleſſings of his right hand, and of his left? Hath ſhe not been counted the Mirrour of all Nations? Hath not the ſound of her Inhabitants gone thorough the earth? Have not the Neighbour Nations round about her, bended to her? Hath ſhe not been a help in needful times unto her friends, and a dread and terror to her enemies? But how hath <hi>England</hi> requited the Lord? Hath ſhe rightly anſwered his Love, and walked in his Light? Or hath ſhe not caſt the Teſtimony of his Law behind her? The unparallel'd Mercies of her God are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued and forgotten by her; therefore is he drawing near in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt her; for the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> are found to be within her, and the Cry of Blood purſues her. Time after time hath the righteous God ſent his Warnings to her, but hitherto they have been little regarded by her: Ah! how long hath ſhe grieved her righteous God, and her iniquities been a burthen to his people! And to add to her unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and multiply her Miſery, ſhe hath abuſed God's Meſſengers: How many of his Prophets hath ſhe impriſoned? And which of her Gaols have not been v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſited, by her impriſoning the ſons of Innocency? Not for any guile that hath been found in their lips, but onely for witneſſing againſt her iniquity and unworthineſs. And ſhall not the righteous God viſit for theſe things? Will he not be avenged on ſuch a people? Certainly 'tis time for her to be clothed in Sackcloth, and happy were it for her, would ſhe faſt from iniquity. O that I might ſee her Princes ſet in the Houſe of Mourning, and her Nobles weeping in the duſt. But <hi>England</hi> is ſick, and ſees it not; ſhe is near the Grave, and not ſenſible of it: Therefore is her Condition more deſperate, and her Malady the more incurable. O <hi>England! England!</hi> my Native Countrey, Calamity is coming very ſwiftly upon thee, yet neither thy Princes, Peers, nor Prelates (ſo called) ſeek to comfort thee, nor miniſter any Cordial, or the Balm of Gilead to recover thee. O ceaſe from thy Iniquity, and kiſs the Rod that ſmites thee, elſe verily I ſee thou runs on to thy ruin, and in thy madneſs rides poſt to Perdition.</p>
            <p>Ah friends! Is this a time to fall out with your fellow-ſervants? Hath not <hi>England</hi> Enemies enow abroad to invade and over-run her, but you muſt needs imbrue your hands in the blood of your native Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? Do not your Enemies laugh at your folly? And will they not be ready to rejoyce at your ruine? There is an opportunity put into your hands, and the God of <hi>Englands</hi> Mercies without doubt hath done it: Do you not ſee the undermining ſubtilty of your Enemies? If this blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Spirit be not timely rebuked, <hi>Rome</hi> will ſoon triumph in <hi>Englands</hi> Ruines. Verily I muſt deale plainly with you herein; for my life is not dear unto me, to do <hi>England</hi> good.</p>
            <p>O Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as yet thou haſt Power, and know that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>'s God hath given it unto thee: Be a bridle to that bloody Spirit, and cruſh the Cockatrice in the ſhell; for if thou ſuffer this Jeſuitical Deſign to have its ſwing, it will neither leave thee root nor branch: Therefore (my Friends) ſeek peace, and purſue it, and be no longer lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amaleck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let your minds be ſtaid upon the Principle of God which he hath placed in your conſciences: Be ſtill (I ſay) in your minds, and come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to calmneſs; let the loftineſs of man be laid low, and wait in filence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the living God; liſten and encline your ear unto his ſtill voice, that is it which moves to holineſs, mercy, and moderation. The Spirit of the Lord leads to patience, and counſels his people to forgive their enemies. The righteous Seed ſeeks not for revenge, it cannot endure to have its Garment ſtain'd with blood, and yet it's a Principle that pleads for true obedience to Rulers; but would not have the King drink the blood of the people. The Golden Mean, I muſt tell you, is the beſt; and when you ſit in Judgement, ſee that you remember Mercy; and I warn you in the fear of God, be tender of the life of man.</p>
            <p>And as for Religion, this the righteous God requires of you: Seek not to bind the Conſciences of any whoſe hearts are truly ſet towards <hi>Sion,</hi> nor conſent not to eſtabliſh any form by an outward force, but give free Toleration in the exerciſe of a tender Conſcience. Be as zealous as you can in the reſtraining of Vice and Vanity in your own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and in the Nation. Let your Laws be a terror to evil-doers, but let the righteous find you favourers of God's people. And take heed of <hi>Amaleck,</hi> that Prelatical conſcience-binding Spirit, which ſubtilly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes you to an outward conformity; for <hi>Amaleck's</hi> deſign is to preach up Perſecution.</p>
            <p>You may take notice of the preceding Powers that have been ſplit upon this Rock: How many Overturnings have you known of late? And did any perſecuting plot of late ever proſper? And do You think to make war againſt the Lamb, and to meet with Victory? If you find it ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ſay there is no God in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It is in vain for man to ſtrive againſt his Maker; for the Lord God Omnipotent is leading and will bring his ſeed out of the houſe of bondage, and if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhall refuſe to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go free, God will multiply his plagues upon him, and drown him and his Hoſt in the red Sea: Read who can. Wherefore, O Friends, be perſwaded to moderation, and let not the innocent be the object of your wrath, becauſe in feigned humility they come not to you, nor with the windy words of man's hollow wiſdome they cannot feed you. Plain down-right dealing is a Jewel; and the righteous feel more true joy in the wearing of it, then the <hi>Egyptians</hi> do in all their Jewels.</p>
            <p>And as for us (whom the ſcornful generation do call <hi>Quakers)</hi> were we of the World, the World would love Us, for the World loves its own; but we are not of the World, therefore the World hates Us; but we know it hated Chriſt before us: And this we know alſo, our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries cannot lay their yoak upon us, till the Lord ſuffer them, nor can they go beyond their limit, and the wrath of man ſhall be reſtrained: God may ſuffer them to try us, but they ſhall not deſtroy us. Therefore do not You reſolve within your ſelves that you will ſuppreſs the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeed in the people called <hi>Quakers.</hi> For know this aſſuredly, That Spirit which goes about it, muſt bow unto it, and fall before it; for they are of the ſeed of the <hi>Jews;</hi> read me within: <hi>Sion</hi> muſt be a burthenſom ſtone unto her enemies; God is, and will be tender of his Seed, and all that fall upon it, ſhall be broken by it.</p>
            <p>Alas poor Mortals! think you to limit that which is Eternal? You may as well command the fire from burning, the wind from blowing, the ſun from ſhining, the rain from ſhowering, and the graſs from ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up or growing, as offer to attempt it. If you can ſpan the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Earth, and dry up the vaſt Ocean with your breath; if you can turn the <hi>Autumn</hi> into <hi>Spring,</hi> or count the number of the Stars, and reckon every ſand upon the ſea ſhore; then may you limit the holy One, and drown his Iſrael in the ſea.</p>
            <p>But who is ſufficient for theſe things? Therefore, O Friends, come into the Humility, and be no longer high minded, but learn the holy fear, and bow to God's Witneſs in every one of your conſciences, and anſwer the requirings of it, by your obedience to it; while the Light of God is ſhining in you, <hi>it is day;</hi> his ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with fleſh; work while the light is with you; the night comes when no man can work; wherefore prize your time, &amp; repent, and believe and walk in the Light, leaſt for your diſobedience the Lord God omnipotent overturn your Mountain, and bring his Wheel over you; and then what are you?</p>
            <p>And as for us, our Hope and Help is in <hi>Iſrael's</hi> God, and we fear not man, nor what man can do unto us, we are well known to be a harmleſs people, and have learnt to pray for them that perſecute us, and deſire to live peaceably with all men. Therefore be not prejudiced in your minds towards us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor go about to make Laws againſt us, becauſe we de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
