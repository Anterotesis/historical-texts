            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Cannot, without Grief and Sorrow of Heart, reflect upon the sad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of our present Differences in and about the smaller Matters of Religion, whereas we agree in all the Essentials thereof; but do much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that bitter and censorious Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shew, and particularly appeareth in the Person I have now to do with, which all that read his Books will quickly perceive. Pray do but see what a kind of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement he put twice into the <hi>City Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> of his last Treatise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein he positively denies those he calls <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> to be <hi>Churches;</hi> and their <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> he affirms to be a <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> which is the Baptism of Believers or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult Persons; and that because we do not ground Gospel-baptism upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but upon the great Commission our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gave to his Disciples after he rose from the Dead, as it is contained, <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 20. Mark 16. 15, 16.</hi> This is such an Attempt, that none of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who are <hi>Pedo-baptists</hi> (nor any that ever I read of) assayed to do. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Baptism be a Truth of Christ, or a Counterfeit, will appear in our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; but why are we no Churches? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we are Churches; for a Church may consist of wicked Men as well as of good Men; but I suppose he means we are not true Churches of Christ; he, as I judge, not knowing from what Theam that word is derived, we must be wicked Persons or else Churches of Christ. This Man hath come too near to the Expressions and bitter Reflections <hi>John Child</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against us, <hi>falsely called, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists;</hi> who soon after fell under fearful horror of Conscience and Desperation. He wrote a Book against us, rendring us very odious to the World, and casting Contempt upon our saithful Ministers, but quickly was convinced of his horrid Design, crying out, in Despair, <hi>That he had touched the Apple of God's Eye; for,</hi> said he, <hi>if God has any People in the World, those that I have vilified are his,</hi> or to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The Lord deliver this Man from such a Spirit and dismal end; but 'tis bad modling (as we used to say) with edge Tools. Our Saviour shews the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of rash Judgment;</hi> and what have

Hath he been as good as his word, or hath he not? (they are proper Judges who have read his Book.) I think few Men who have had to do with us in this Controversie shewed a more four Spirit than Mr. <hi>Eaxter;</hi> and yet did he ever deny us to be Churches, or call our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism a Counterfeit? Pray take his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of us, when in a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, who are most against them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again he saith, That <hi>Augustin</hi> and many Children of Christians were baptized at Age, and that the Controversie is of so great Difficulty, that if in all such Cases none that differ be tollerated, we may not live together in the World or Church, but endlesly excommunicate or perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute one another,</q> 
               <hi>Baxter's Book, Principle of Love,</hi> page 7. But Mr. Shute hath appeared so bold and rash as if he had an infallible Spirit, and seems to be so lifted up as if he hath done more in his short Tract, than all those learned Men who have formerly and of late times asserted <hi>Pedo-baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that now <hi>we are totally confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and <hi>We, and our Cause of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Baptism gone for ever.</hi> See his Title Page.</p>
            <p>And in pag. 113. saith he, <q>Thus I have given you one Broad side more, by which I have brought your whole Opinion by the Lee, and all the Carpenters and Calk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Nation cannot save it from Sinking.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I wish he knew his own Spirit and Weakness better, and not thus to admire what he hath done: Doth he think there is none can answer his Arguments? No


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59964:3"/>
saving our Baptism and Churches from sinking to the bottom, which he hath so furiously attacked? sad Case! What could <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> or proud <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaketh</hi> say more?</p>
            <p>But he forgot the old Proverb, <hi>Let not him boast that puts on his Armour as he that puts it off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I or my Reverend Brother <hi>Collins,</hi> have in any Writings of Ours used hard Words, we have cause to be troubled, for the Truth never gained any thing that way: 'Tis not hard Words, but hard Arguments that must do the Business; <hi>A soft Answer</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith) <hi>turneth away Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must say, I had rather have to do with a Man that hath more Argument and less Confidence than I can find in his Writing, or Spirit.</p>
            <p>I am sorry he had no better Counsel, or followed no better Conduct, at such an hour as this is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it sure concerns us all <hi>to study the things that make for Peace, and that by which we may edifie one another;</hi> the Breach is too wide already. O what want of Love is there in Christians to each other, who are all Members of the Mystical Body of Christ, and Children of one Father, and Heirs of the same glorious Inheritance! Sure we shall love one another when we come to Heaven; and I hope <hi>His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Pastor</hi> (whom I have more cause both to love and honour than ten thousand Instructors in Christ, <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blessed Instrument in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version all most forty Years ago)</hi> gave no Encouragement to him thus to write and abuse his Brethren. I would he had consider'd the Text, <hi>He that hateth his Brother, is in Darkness</hi> Joh. 2. 11. For my part I hope I can say I love them in whom I see the Image of God, that differ from me, in the like degree as those of mine own Opinion. I am persuaded the want of Love to one another is one of the greatest Sins of this Age, and that which is a high Provocation to God; and if that which this Man hath done is a fruit of Love, or tends to promote it, I am mistaken. True, I have (may be) wrote as much of late as another on the Subject of Baptism; but never without Provocation, by means of divers Persons who have of late times wrote against us. I have not begun the Controversie, but have still been on the defensive Side; nor can any justly blame us to clear our selves, and defend that which we believe to be the Truth of Christ when urged to it.</p>
            <p>As to his Answer to Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> he hath said something, 'tis true, to one or two of his Arguments, but the rest he has passed by in silence, and left the chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentive part, in a great measure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered. And as to his Reply to me, I cannot see he hath said any thing that deserveth my notice at all; but lest the easie, unwary and prejudiced Reader, should conclude he hath done Wonders, should we aot return an Answer. I have examined the stress of all that seems Argumentive, which contains but a small part of his Book, and having studied Moderation and Tenderness, I hope it may tend to allay and quench the Fire of his Passion, and bring him to a more moderate Temper.</p>
            <p>However, I shall leave it to the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God to dispose of the Issue of it, as he shall seem good in his all-wise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and to help the Reader, I have divided his Book into Chapters in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; and since he begins with the form or manner of baptizing there, I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin also.</p>

                  <hi>I think there is more to be said for Sprinkling or Pouring Water on the Face in Baptism than there is for Dipping or Ducking over Head and Ears in a River or Pond: For the latter is more like a Punishment of Criminals than the Solemnizing of an Ordinance of God; pray hear what the Scripture saith of Sprinkling and of Pouring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon Sinners to cleanse them.</hi> Heb 12. 24 And to Jesus, the Mediator of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi> 1. You might have added many other Places of Scripture, where we read of Sprinkling: But what would it signify? the Sprinkling and Pouring mentioned in these Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, refer not to <hi>Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Baptism:</hi> Read your learned <hi>Annotators</hi> and <hi>Expositors,</hi> and you will find they agree as one Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Sprinkling and Pouring of Water (in <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> &amp;c.) do refer to the graci us Effusion of the Spirit in the Times of the Gospel, and to the Purifying and Purging Vertue of the Blood of Christ; and so that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 24. is to be understood, you should not only say, but prove Baptism to be here intended, and then yoù had said something.</p>
            <p>2. Should the Sprinkling or Pouring in these Scriptures, be meant of Baptism, then it would follow that Baptism has mighty Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it indeed, even to wash away all Sin and Filthiness: I thought nothing could cleanse from Sin out Christ's precious blood, as it is applyed by the Spirit, through Faith. Baptism, <hi>Peter</hi> tells you, washes not away the Filthiness of the Flesh. <hi>Not the putting away of the Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Flesh, but the answer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 20.</p>
            <p>3. If you should say, Baptism is chiefly a Sign or lively Symbol of our being sprinkled with the Spirit, or with the Blood of Jesus Christ, we do deny it. You have not attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to prove it, 'tis evident Baptism is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally a Sign or Symbol of Christ's Death,


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59964:4"/>
Burial and Resurrection, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12, 13. compared with this in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20. which Sprinkling or Pouring cannot hold forth.</p>
            <p>4. But you intimate, That these <hi>Spiritual Metaphorical Baptisms are nearly related to the Ordinance of Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, <hi>by pouring Floods of Water,</hi> or by the great Effusion of the Spirit; I deny not but the Baptism of the Spirit may be held forth; and the Baptism of the Spirit signifies <hi>Immersion. Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 1. 5. The <hi>Greek Word</hi>

                  </gap>h-pond.</q> See Dr. <hi>Duveil</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Casaubon</hi> was a Pedo-baptist, yet knew better than to assert <hi>Baptizo</hi> is to Sprinkle or Pour, but to Dip or Plunge, as you here.</p>
            <p>Friend, what do you mean by saying, <hi>All those metaphorical Baptisms are nearly related to the Ordinance of Baptism;</hi> if you intend both signifies Sprinkling, I deny it, for both of them signifie Dipping or Overwhelming, and so doth the Baptism of Afflictions also, 'tis not every small degree of Suffering that is the Baptism of Suffering: Great Afflictions are so called, and that from the literal and genuine Signification of the Word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> to dip, to plunge under; and hence (as I have elswhere shewed) <hi>Vossius</hi> notes, That every light Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not the Baptism of Affliction, but like that of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 32. 6. <hi>He drew me out of deep Waters;</hi> hence also Sufferings and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are called Waves, <hi>Thy Waves and thy Billows are gone over me,</hi> Psal. 42. 7. it refers to Christ's Sufferings, who was overwhelmed with Afflictions, even unto Blood and Death. The same as I have hinted is to be noted as to the Baptism of the Spirit, it signifies the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous effusion of the holy Spirit, like that at the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> Acts 2. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Now, in this respect the Metaphorical Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms, are nearly related in Signification with the Ordinance of Baptism: I do confess, for to Baptize in the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to dip in the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for a more full and clear Demonstration of this from a multitude of learned Men, both Ancient and Modern. See my late Answer to Mr. <hi>Burki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Scapula</hi> and <hi>Stephens,</hi> Two famous Men for their great Learning, and accounted Masters of the Greek Tongue, tell us, That <hi>Baptizo</hi> from <hi>Bapto,</hi> as to the first and proper Signification, signifies <hi>Mergo, Immergo, item tingo quod fit im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uere, viz.</hi> to dip, plunge and overwhelm, put under, cover over, to die in Colours, which is done by Plunging. <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, it signifies to <hi>dip over Head and Ears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pasor,</hi> an <hi>immersion, dipping or submersion,</hi> it appears you neither know nor enquire after the proper, literal and genuine Signification of the Word, if you did you would certainly not say, You think there is more to be said for Sprinkling; for I would have you ask such as can tell you, Whether in those Places in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where <hi>Sprinkling</hi> is mentioned, the Word signifies <hi>Baptizing,</hi> or whether it is not <hi>rantizing,</hi> another Word and of another Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.</p>
            <p>And as you regard not the literal, so you mind not the mistical Signification of Baptism; which is not chiefly to represent the Sprinkling of Christ's Blood, but to hold forth in a lively Figure his Death, Burial and Resurrection, together with our Death unto Sin, and rising again to walk in newness of Life; as will far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear in its proper Place. See our late Annotators on <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>And were baptized of him in</hi> Jordan. <q>A great part of those who went out to hear <hi>John,</hi> say they, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, that is, <hi>dipped in</hi> Jordan.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' they would have the Word to signify washing also, which we deny not; but then say we, 'tis such a Washing as is by Dipping, always, when applyed to this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>5. You seem very bold, in saying, <q>

               </q> 'Tis no marvel you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us, when you dare cast such contempt upon Christ's Sacred Institution; it is to me a trembling Consideration thus to arraign the Wisdom of God: Nor will it salve the matter should you say, You do not think Baptism is Dipping, for it may be so as far as you know; and if you had read what a multitude of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men (who were <hi>Pedo Baptists</hi>) do affirm it is Dipping, you would not sure have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to assert such a thing: Suppose it be found at the last Day to be Dipping, the Lord give you Repentance, that you may have this

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>But you say Page</hi> 6, 7. <hi>We do not find that there was either a River, or Pond of Water in the Jaylors House for himself and all his Houshold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer, Sir,</hi> you should take more heed to your words and to what you assert. Is it said they were baptized in the <hi>Jaylors</hi> House? if it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> been done in a House, our Saviour needed not to have gone to the <hi>River Jordan</hi> to be Baptized; much less into <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</hi> Nor was there any reason for <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ch</hi> to have gone into the Water.</p>
            <p>2. Moreover, doth not the Holy Scripture tell you that <hi>John also was Baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water,</hi> John 3. 23. Pray Reader note this well; mind the reason why the Holy Ghost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith, he Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Aenon;</hi> 'tis po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sitively affirmed, because there was much Water in that place, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting clearly that a little Water will not serve to Baptize Persons in: Also observe what Mr. <hi>Pools Annotations</hi> say on this place of Scripture; thus you will find it expressed, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>It is from this apparent, that both Christ and <hi>John</hi> Baptized by Dipping the Body in Water, else they need not have sought places where had been great plenty of Water.</q> These are his words that wrote those Annotations. And if it be so apparent, 'tis as apparent you have been too bold to say, that Dipping is more like a punishment of Criminals than an ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>3. What though we do not read that the <hi>Jaylor</hi> had a River, or Pond, in his Yard, or near his House ('tis rediculous to talk of a River or Pond in his House) yet we ought to believe there was Water enough by, or near his House, to Baptize him and all his, who believed. You see it is granted by your own worthy Brethren, Baptizing is Dipping; there was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> need for the Holy Ghost to speak of the place where this Water was, or whether it was a Pond or River: And certainly they did not Baptize some, and sprinkle or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>antize others; Gospel-Baptism being but one and the same, as to the subject and mode of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration.</p>
            <p>4. How can you say <hi>Page</hi> 7. that they were all Baptized in his own House, when the Text speaks not any such thing?</p>
            <p>2. How can you presume to assert, that they did not go out of the House? <hi>Reader</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Text well, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. <hi>And brought them out and said, Sirs what must I do to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 31. <hi>And they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy House; and they spake unto him and to all that were in his House,</hi> vers. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he took them the same hour of the Night and washed their Stripes; and was Baptized <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and all his, straight way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from these words Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> affirms, that <hi>they were all Baptized in his House, that is, in the Jaylors House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>That they were Baptized the same hour of the Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>That they did not go out of the House to a River.</hi> If you can see these three Things in these Verses you have better Eyes than I have.</p>
            <p>As to what was done the same hour of the Night 'tis directly in plain words asserted, <hi>viz. He washed their Stripes.</hi> As to the time when Baptized, it is said, <hi>Straight way.</hi> If you will have the same Hour and Straight way to intend both the washing their Stripes, and their being Baptized, it is more than can be gathered therefrom; but if that be granted, might they not in that <hi>hour</hi> go a little way out of the House and be Baptized? 'tis evident he abuses the Sacred Text.</p>
            <p>4. What reason hath he also to affirm, <hi>that none believed but the Jaylor himself? for so</hi> he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. These are his words. <hi>Page</hi> 7. <q>
                  <hi>We do not read of any one Soul of them that did believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Jaylor himself, before they were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; nor of any one act of Faith they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> We do read in vers. 34. <hi>And when he had brought them into his House he set Meat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and rejoyced, believing in God with all his House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. He will say, may be, this was after they were Baptized. I answer, we read not one word of the <hi>Jaylors</hi> believing himself tell then: I mean tho' he believed before, and all his House believed before either were Baptized; yet 'tis not expressed by the Holy Ghost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after they had been Baptized, and were come into his House, and <hi>he set Meat before them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God with all his House;</hi> So that here is as much mention made of that act of Faith his whole House exerted, as of the <hi>Jaylors</hi> own Faith, and as soon also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59964:5"/>3. And is it not evident likewise that they were before out of the Jaylors House, else why is it said <hi>when he had brought them into his House,</hi> &amp;c. that is, after they were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised; take heed how you write at another time, lest you provoke God by adding and diminishing from his Sacred Word.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In Page 12 (you say) <hi>you believe, that there were more modes in Baptism than one, for some went down into the Water, and others were Baptised in their Houses: but</hi> (say you) <hi>I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not that any were Ducked all under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it is possible their Faces might be Dipped, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Plunging the whole Body under Water, or by pouring Water on their Faces.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> That which you again assert. I again affirm, is not true, <hi>viz.</hi> That some were Baptised in their Houses; what you have said of the <hi>Jaylors</hi> being Baptised in his own House, all may see is without Book, and without the least shadow of proof, nor do you, nor can you prove it of any other.</p>
            <p>2. If there were more modes of Baptism than one, then there were different significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the same ordinance, and all of them could not be held forth in the Baptism of each person; for such that were Dipped, tho' it was but the Head only, were taught the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Mysteries represented thereby, and those that were sprinkled only with Water, or had Water poured upon them, were taught the proper Symbols or signification of that mode; but how absur'd that would be I leave to all impartial wise Men to consider.</p>
            <p>3. And if this was so, how then was the way and ordinance of God in their Holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, one and the same in all the Churches of the Saints? you may as well say the modes of the Administration of the Lords Supper were more than one, and so allow of the <hi>Popish mode</hi> therein, who deny the <hi>Lai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>4. If Dipping was one mode and Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling another, then would <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Rantism</hi> be both ordinances of Christ, ask the learned what the word for (<hi>Sprinkling</hi>) is in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, and if they do not tell you (if they speak the truth) 'tis (Rantising) I will confess I have in this done you wrong, and mistook my self: But we deny Sprinkling is Baptism for Dipping of the whole Body; is an essential, not an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Baptism. Baptism is compared to a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, that's clear from <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by a multitude of learned Men who were <hi>Pedo Baptists,</hi> as you shall hear anon. Now will you say, if the Face or Head only of a Dead Corps was covered with Earth, and not the whole Body, that the Corps was buried? if you should, would you not be laught at? Our Saviour was buried, not his Head on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but his whole Body also <hi>in the Heart of the Earth,</hi> and he whose whole Body is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all over in the Earth, is not buried; no more is he whose whole Body is not covered all over in the Water-Baptised. Baptism is a lively Figure of the Burial of our Blessed Lord, and of our Death to Sin and being Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him both in Sign and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>In Page 12. (say you) <hi>produce one positive <q>command or example to prove, that ever any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man went down into a River, or Pond to be Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, or Ducked, all under Water in Baptism, throughout the Book of God, or else take your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man invention to your self;</q>
               </hi> these are your words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> If we prove that a Woman by name was Baptized, then we prove a Woman was Dipped, because Baptized in <hi>Greek</hi> is Dipped in <hi>English:</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> (as I have elsewhere shewed) have so Translated the Word, <hi>viz. Doop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>Dipped in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now in Act. 16. we read of <hi>Lydia</hi> who was Baptized, that is, Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; and in <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 12. <hi>when they believing Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip preaching the things concerning the Kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were Baptized, both Men and Women:</hi> That is, saith the <hi>Dutch Translation,</hi> they were <hi>Dooped both Men and Women:</hi> our Translators have left the Greek word untranslated into our Tongue. What difference is there between <hi>Baptisma</hi> (Greek) and <hi>Baptism?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But Sir, I cannot but take notice how often you add <hi>Ducking</hi> to <hi>Dipping:</hi> Is not this to reproach and cast contempt upon us, and on the ordinance of Christ of Dipping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in his name? The Lord open your Eyes and give you repentance, in mercy to your poor Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In Page 13. <hi>because every Sinner God draws to Christ must come to him naked,</hi> &amp;c <hi>So you say it must be in Baptism,</hi> viz. <hi>that part of the Man, Woman, or Child that is Baptized must be naked, and so plead only for the Baptizing of the Face.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> Sir, what reason do you give for this? have you any ground to run that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel from any Text of Scripture? Is it not of your own making and devising? But since you are for plain Texts of Scripture for every

As to what Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> said to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> of a former custom in some nations of Baptizing naked, it affects not us, nor do I believe there was ever any such custom used among any godly Christians. Nor did Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> ever so Baptise any Maids in <hi>Bewdeley</hi> nor any where else. If he said he could do it, it was doubtless his weakness so to speak; but I am not bound to believe all that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath wrote of worthy Mr. <hi>Tombs;</hi> but since they are both dead we will say no more to that; but any thing you can catch up you resolve 'tis plain to make the greatest use of imaginable to reproach your godly Neighbours and the truth of Christ.</p>
            <p>In Pape 15. <hi>the Anabaptists (you say) make a great</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>deal of pudder and stir about the Apostles words in</hi> Romans 6. 3, 4. <hi>and have pressed them into their service; the words are as followeth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are buried with him by Baptism; they will (say you) have it that this respects burying in Water over Head and Ears in Baptism, and therefore they make it an argument for Dipping: The Apostle (you say) seems to have been stirring them up, and puting them in mind of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal vows and Obligations: It may be as well to Children of believing parents that were grown up, as to themselves; for in</hi> vers. 3 <hi>saith he, know ye not that so many of us as were Baptised into Christ, were Baptized into his Death? that is (say you) as they were Baptized into all the priviledges, that were purchased by the Death of Christ, so they were baptised also into the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ, for they were obliged by their Baptismal Covenant to take up their Cross and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> You shall now see whether 'tis only those whom you call <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> that make such improvement of this Text (you say pudder and stir about it) or whether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who were and are <hi>Pedo Baptists,</hi> do not make the like use of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is an Image, Symbol or representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs Death, and burial and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, together with our Death unto sin, and vivification to a newness of Life: But before I shall quote the Authors I must tell you the Apostle is not in the context speaking of the sufferings of believers, not a word of bearing the Cross: Therefore from the Scope and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the Text you cannot infer any such conclusion as you do. Pray Reader take notice of the 5th Chapter and the beginning of this 6th, and see if I or this Man speak the truth of the Texts in, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. of this Chapter; the Holy Apostle says thus, <hi>i. e. What shall we say then? Shall we continue in Sin that grace may abound, God forbid; how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein,</hi> vers. 2. <hi>Know you not that so many of us as have been Baptized into Jesus Christ, were Baptized into his Death,</hi> vers. 3. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptism into Death: That like as Christ was raised up from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of Life,</hi> vers. 4. <hi>For as we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also into the likeness of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> vers. 5. Is here a word of the Cross, or suffering for Christ, or that we are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to shew we must suffer Martyrdom with Christ? no, no, unless it be the Death or morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of sin or the old Man. Tho' I deny not but such that are Baptized must look for suffering.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You say, <hi>our Saviour calls his suffering his Baptism, and a Blood Bloody Baptism it was; but I have a Baptism to be Baptized with, and how am I straightned till it be accomplished?</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>now (you say) the Apostle draws his argument from the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in verses</hi> 4, 5, <hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> 'Tis very true, the Apostle doth draw his argument from <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5. &amp;c. but not from <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 50. the Text you mention about Christs Baptism of suffering, so that 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all you have abused this Sacred Text also, and prest it in, to serve your purpose: Pray read all the <hi>Annotators</hi> you can get on the place particularly, Mr. <hi>Pools,</hi> and see if any favour your exposition of it.</p>
            <p>2. Tho' I have said enough to silence this Man or any other upon this Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3,

4, 5. in two Treatises, yet left they come not into the Author or Readers Hand, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat some passages once again.</p>
            <p>Let all Men consider in the fear of God, and take notice of the gracious design, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention of our blessed Saviour in his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of the two great ordinances of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>viz. the Lords Supper</hi> and <hi>Baptism;</hi> for as that of the Lords Supper doth in a lively Figure represent the breaking of his Body, and the pouring forth of his Blood, so the ordinance of Baptism doth as clearly (if rightly Administed) represent or hold forth the Death, Burial, and resurrection of the same Lord Jesus: Together with our death to sin and rising again to walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Life; and that this appears from this Text and that in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. shall, God assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be evinced. The whole Church of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and every member thereof were to reckon themselves dead to Sin, and were bound to live no longer therein, because by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as in a lively Figure they had held forth the same thing, nay by that Baptismal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they were obliged to live and walk in newness of life.</p>
            <p>See <hi>Pools Annotations</hi> on the place, where you will find these words, <hi>viz.</hi> he seems to allude <q>to the manner of Baptizing in those warm Countries, which was to Dip or plunge the party Baptised, and as it were to bury him for a while under water: See the like Phrase, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. Baptism doth not only represent our Mortification, and death unto sin, but our progress and perseverance therein; <hi>Burial</hi> implies a continuing under death, so Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is a continual dying unto sin: Look as after the Death and Burial of Christ there followed his Resurrection, so it must be with us, we must have Communion with, and conformity to the Lord Jesus Christ, in his Resurrection as well as in his Death; both these are represented and sealed to us, in the Sacrament of Baptism, &amp;c.</q> thus <hi>Pools Annotations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Assembly</hi> also in their <hi>Annotations</hi> on this Text say much the same things, <hi>viz.</hi> In <q>this Phrase the Apostle seems to allude to the Ancient manner of Baptizing, which was to Dip the party Baptized, and as it were to bury them under Water for a while, and then to raise them up again out of it, to represent the Burial of the old Man and the Resurrection to newness of Life. <hi>Diodate</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> saith the same. <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon the place says we are buried with Christ by Baptism into death; by the ceremony of Baptism, because he (that is, the party Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized) is put under Water, and by this carries a similitude of him that was buried who was put under the Earth. Now because none are buried but dead Men, from this very thing that we are buried in Baptism we are assimulated to Christ buried, and when he was buried.</q>

            </list>
            <p>The form of Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> External and <q>Essential, is no other than the Analogical proportion which the signs keep with the things signified thereby; for the properties of the Water, washing away the defilements of the Body, does in a most suitable simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude set forth the Efficacy of Christ's Blood in blotting out of sin; so dipping into the Water in a most lively similitude sets forth the Mortification of the old Man, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out of the Water, the vivification of the new Man—The same plunging into the Water (saith he) holds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>forth to us that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Gulph of Divine Justice, in which Christ for our sakes for a while was in a manner swallowed up; abiding under the Water (how little a time so ever) denotes his descent into Hell, even the very deepest of Lifelesness, which lying in the sealed or guarded Sepulchre, he was accounted as one dead: Rising out of the Water holds forth to us a lively similitude of the conquest which this dead Man got over death; in like manner we being Baptized into his death and buried with him, should rise also with him, and go on in a new Life. Thus far the learned <hi>Tilenus.</hi>

               <q>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> 2.

To these <hi>Ancient Writers</hi> let are once again add here for your further convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what some of the chefest Prelates of the Church of England have very lately said on,</q> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> the present Lord <hi>Arch-Bishop of York,</hi> in a Sermon preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queens Majesty on Easter Day, <hi>March</hi> 27, 1692. saith he, and this in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <q>times was taught every Christian in and by his Baptism; when ever a person was Baptized, he was not only to profess his Faith in Christs Death and Resurrection, but he was to look upon himself as obliged in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence therewith to mortifie his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer carnal affections and to enter upon a new State of Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And the very form of Baptism (saith he) did lively represent this obligation to them: For what did their plunging under water sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but their undertaking, in imitation of Christs Death and Burial, to forsake all their former evil courses; As their ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Water did their engagement to lead a Holy and Spiritual Life? This our Apostle (saith he) doth more than once declare to us thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. 4. <hi>We are buried with Christ by Baptism unto Death, that like as Christ was raised up by the glory of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so we should walk in newness of Life.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Sharp.</hi>

                  <hi>Calvin</hi> also saith <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 16. that Baptism is a form or way of burial; and none but such as are already dead to sin, or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented from dead works, are to be buried.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But now say we, sprinkling and pouring is not the form of Baptism, because not the form of a Burial; nor can Infants be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it; because as the learned observe, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is a Symbol of present, not of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; 'tis an outward sign of that Death unto sin, which the party Baptised passed under then, or ought to have had before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd; they then professed themselves to be Dead to sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they were Buried with Christ in their Baptism, for the argument of the Apostle lies in that respect, <hi>How shall we that are Dead to sin live any longer therein? know you not, that so many of us who were Baptized into Christ were Baptized into his Death,</hi> both in sign and signification? And therefore as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> says, they rise out of that <hi>watry Grave as new born Creatures;</hi> it denotes not only what they should be hereafter, but what they were actually at that time. So that as this Text and arguments drawn there from utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn sprinkling and pouring, as that which is not Christs true Baptism, so it excludes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from being the true subjects thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in them appears no such Death to Sin, nor can they be said to come out of that <hi>Watry</hi> Grave as new born Creatures.</p>
            <p>I will only quote one Author more and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and that is learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> on <q>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. There are (saith he) two parts in rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration <hi>i. e.</hi> Mortification and Vivification, that is called a burial with Christ, this a Resurrection; with Christ; the Sacrament of both these is Baptism; in which we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed or buried, and after that do come forth and rise again: It may not be said truly but sacramentally of all that are Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, that they are buried wich Christ and raised with him, but only of such who have true faith. Thus <hi>Zanchy.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now Sir, see what a stir and pudder (as you call it) these <hi>Pedo-Paptists</hi> make on this Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. to prove Baptism is Dipping or a figure of a burial? Would you not have us give the true sense of the Word wherein we concur with all learned Men? I hope, by this time Reader, thou art fully satisfied that this Man hath said nothing to weaken our Arguments or Grounds for Dipping, tho' 'twice as much we have said on this Account, in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise called <hi>The Rector Rectified;</hi> but this shall suffice here, as to the Mode of Baptizing.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Wherein Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> Reply to Mr. <hi>Hercules Collins</hi> Answer about habitual Faith is considered, detected and clearly refuted; proving that Infants are not required to believe, nor are they (without a miracle) capable so to do, nor are they intended in those places of Scripture that Enjoyns Faith on the Adult.</head>
            <p>BEfore I proceed to take notice of what this Man hath said about Infants having habitual Faith, I shall note two or three things by the Way.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis very remarkable, and worthy the Readers observation, to see how the asserters of <hi>Infant Baptism</hi> differ among themselves about that Faith they suppose to be in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59964:8"/>
for, as I noted in by Answer to Mr. <hi>Smythies Cold resined, Page</hi> 144, some of them, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> asserts, They have the <hi>Faith of the Church,</hi> that being intailed upon all who are within the Pale thereof; others say, they have the Faith of <hi>the Gossips or Sureties;</hi> thus <hi>the Church of England,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Musculus</hi> seems to assert, they have an <hi>Imputed Faith;</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> intimates, They have <hi>a Dogmatical Faith</hi> only; Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it be a saving Faith; but does not tell us how it agrees or differs from the Faith of the Adult; some as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> observes, say, 'Tis a <hi>Physical;</hi> some, a <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical</hi> Faith some a hyperphysical Faith: Some say, They are born Believers, which proceeds from their Patents being in the Covenant and being Believers; but this is to intail Grace to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Regeneration to Generation; nay, and to assert, all are not Children of Wrath by nature, or as they are born and come into the World; others say, They are made Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by Baptism, that Ordinance conveying grace, as Mr. <hi>Rothwell.</hi> This Man asserts, they have habitual Faith; the like do the <hi>Athenian Society</hi> seem to intimate. But which of all these shall we give credit to? The Truth is, they all speak without Book, having no ground from Gods word to say what they do.</p>
            <p>2. We desire it may be considered and carefully heeded, lest we still are abused as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath been, that we stedfastly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and readlly grant it, as an Article of our Faith, That all Infants are under the Guilt and stain of original Sin as they come into the World, and that no Infant can be saved but through the Blood and Imputation of Christs righteousness: And also we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That all those dying Infants who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aved, God doth in some way or another (which is not known to us) <hi>Sanctify them;</hi> for no unclean thing can enter into the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> See our confession of Faith.</p>
            <p>3. We do believe, that no dying Infant can be saved that is not in the Covenant of Grace, for tis (through or) by the Grace, Mercy and Inconceivable Love of God, as 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant of Grace, that Christ, and all Blessings of Christ, are made over to all the Elect, whether Adult or little Infants. We therefore never asserted, That no Infants of Believers, or of unbelievers either, are in the Covenant of Grace; but we do assert, all Elect Infants are in it; Yet we do deny, that the Infants of Believers as such, or as so considered, as bring their Natural Offspring, are in the Covenant of Grace. Having noted these three Things, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. First, take what <hi>Mr. Collins</hi> hath asserted in his Answer to Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> pretended Antidote; See <hi>Page</hi> 3. <hi>viz. That Infants are saved by Christ we have asserted, because we know of no other Name but Jesus; but that they are saved by Faith, habitual Faith in Christ, I must confess I never read in all the Book of God; I could wish he could shew me the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where Christ said any such thing,</hi> i. e. <hi>that Infants are saved by habitual Faith. And what would this Man make a new Bible, have a new rule, to tell us of things never</hi> heard of? These are Mr. <hi>Collins's</hi> words, Take Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> reply; <q>
                  <hi>pray look into that Chapter, saith he, where you find that God hath declared two ways for saving Elect persons; one for the saving of aying Infants, without the Grace of Faith; and the other for saving adult Believers by Faith: And then he asketh two other as impertinent Queries.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on one Text to prove habitual Faith in Infants,</hi> viz Joh. 3. 9. whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him; and he cannot sin because he is born of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> We say there is but one way to be saved, and that one way is Jesus Christ; 'tis by his Sacrifice, by his Blood, by his merits, that is, by the imputation of his righteousness; but that there is the same Way or Mode and no other, for the Application of the Blood and Merits of Christ respecting elect dying Infants, as there is for the Adult; and that God doth not, cannot sanctify dying Infants any other way but by infusing the same habit of Faith, which he infuseth into the Adult who believe, he should prove. God is <hi>a free Agent,</hi> and may have ways to apply the Blood of Christ and Sanctify dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, that we know not of.</p>
            <p>2. As to the Text he brings to prove ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Faith in Infants, of believers, if it be not brought to prove that, that Seed or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Habit is in infants of believers, as such, it does not concern the present controversie; 'tis <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9 which we will now consider and examine. And let it be well noted, <hi>That the Seed remaineth in him,</hi> that sacred habit abides in him, that hath it; it remains and shall remain in every Soul in whom it is infused<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grace in the habit can't be lost, <hi>'Tis a Well or Spring of living Water, that springeth up unto Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 4. 14. Christ hath prayed, That our Faith fail not; that is, the Seed


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59964:8"/>
or Habit thereof; for the Act, in the exercise of it in part may fail now and then; if the Infants of Believers have the Habit of Faith in them, be sure those Habits will appear, and they must be true Believers and be saved, because the Seed remaineth in them.</p>
            <p>3. Why do you not answer Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <hi>Page</hi> 7. of his reply to you, <hi>faith he, those Children of Believers which die in an unconverted state, either never had the Habits of grace, or else if they had them they have lost them; but there is no losing. Habits of grace,</hi> ergo <hi>they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, see what Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> hath said to this Argument in <hi>Page</hi> 42. of his last Book, these are his words, <hi>viz. Therefore I will put it to a fair issue, which shall be this, produce me but</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>one place in all my Book where I have asserted this you have charged upon me, and I will turn Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist immediately,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> If you have not said that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers as such have habitual Faith, what is it you argue for, why do you plead for the habit of Faith to be in them, if you say you plead only for habitual Faith to be in Elect Infants?</p>
            <p>1. Then I hope you will only have Elect Infants to be Baptised, and how do you know which they are, since they can make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith?</p>
            <p>2. Moreover, I also conceive you may allow Baptism to the Infants of Unbelievers: For sure you dare not deny but some of their Seed are comprehended in Gods Eternal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>3. The controversie or difference between us and you lies not how dying Elect Infants are Sanctified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether by the habit of Faith or by some other way, by which God may apply Christs Merits to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But whether the Infants of Believers as such have the habit of Faith, or Faith in any sense, by which they come to have right to that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, what have we to do with dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? did you Baptise no Infants but such that dye and were sure that all the dying Infants of Believers were elected, it might seem some what to the purpose; tho' not so much nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as you may Imagin; for, I do affirm you have as much ground to give them the Lords Supper as you have to Baptise them, because such who are the proper subjects of Baptism, have an immediate right according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Gospel to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>You must have a command or Authority from Christs word to Baptise them, or you ought not to do it; but you have no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand nor Authority.</p>
            <p>4. The habit of Faith without the Act gives not a right to that Sacred ordinance, for Faith and a confession of Faith is required: But I must confess I see not how there can be the habit and not the Act; for tho' the habit may be Antecedent to the Act in order of nature, yet not in order of time in any Believer: Prove, if you can, any person that was a Believer, had the habit of Faith, and yet not the Act of Faith at the same time: For as all learned Men generally agree, as soon as life is infused into a dead sinner, there is Heat, Motion, Activity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the habit of grace is a Vital Principle, and as they say, 'tis naturally active, it is a Spring of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual motion, as Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> shews.</p>
            <p>5. You say Infants may believe: And you would have them to be such Children of the <hi>Jaylors</hi> Houshold, who are said to believe, and yet would have it to be only Faith in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit: But all Men of understanding know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving refers to the Act or exercise of Faith; you may as well say the <hi>Jaylor</hi> had no more than the habit of Faith, for read the words again, <hi>viz. be rejoyced believing in God with all his House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If Infants believe they know the object of their Faith; can any believe in him, <hi>whom they know not?</hi> Faith all Men (I think) agree has its Seat in the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> the understanding is illuminated and sees the need, necessity and excellency of Jesus Christ, and so assents that he is the only Saviour as well as the <hi>Will</hi> consents, bends and bows down in subjection to him: And can any either young or old be said to be Believers or to have Faith, and yet in them is nothing of this? But say you <q>Page 22. <hi>For as much as the Creature is wholly passive in the reception of grace, and Christ is all in all, from the foundation of Mans Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the topstone, therefore a young Child in the Womb or Cradle is as capable of being born again as well as an old one, for both young and old are dead in sin and Trespasses before they are converted.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> You seem to refer to the Almighty power of God: 'Tis very true, he can if he please infuse grace into <hi>a Babe in the Womb</hi> or Cradle, nay <hi>of Stones raise up Children to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> but the question is not what God can do, but what God doth do: Though we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the creature is passive in the first recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59964:9"/>
of Grace, yet how do you prove God doth regenerate Infants in the Womb or Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? Gods Grace is infused into fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subjects; and tho the Grace by which we believe is from God, yet 'tis the Creature that doth believe. Why do we say that <hi>Irrational creatures</hi> are not fit Soil for the Seed of the word? is it not because they have no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? and tho' Infants have rational Souls yet till they come to maturity they have no knowledg nor understanding; the design of God in sowing the Seed or Habit of Grace is, that the Fruits thereof may be produced and brought forth: But you must say the Fruits of grace do not appear in Babes, which <hi>is Love, Joy, Peace, Longsuffering Gentleness, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Faith, Meckness, Temperance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. Nor is it possible it should without a Miracle.</p>
            <p>Such as is the Cause, such is the effect or product of it. How God doth Sanctify dying Infants (I speak as to the Mode of it) no mortal Man I am sure can tell; if it is by infusing Grace, let it be so, tho' it can't be proved whilst the World stands, yet Gods design therein could not be the same in them as it is in others; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth no such fruit from them: Nor can any Gospel ordinance be the right of such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants nor any other, without a precept or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from Gods word.</p>
            <p>Baptism (as you have heard) is a significant ordinance, 'tis an outward sign of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin and of Vivification to a new life, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith is required in respect of the act of it touching the gracious promise of God made to all such who are the true subjects thereof, see what Dr. <hi>Taylor Late Bishop of Down</hi> speaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this notion of Infants having habitual faith, <hi>viz.</hi> are there any Acts precedent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <q>concomitant or consequent to this pretended habit? this strange invention is absolutely without Art, without Scripture, Reason, or Authority. And further, saith he, if any run for succour to that exploded <hi>Cresphu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eton,</hi> that Infants have faith or any other inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red habit of I know not what, or how, we desire no more advantage than that they are constrained to answer without Revelation, against reason, common sense and all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Again, he saith, how can any Man know they have faith, since he never saw any sign of it, neither was he told so by any that could tell?</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 22. He strangely reflects upon Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and endeavours to infer that from his Arguments, which no way can in honesty be drawn therefrom, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the whole strength</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>of his arguments against Infant Baptism natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tends to the making Adult Believers the Authors of their own Faith and Eternal Salvation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Let all Men consider the nature of this Mans Spirit; what little ground there is for this Conclusion will soon appear to all that read Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> arguments; doth he deny the infusion of Sacred habits in Believers, or that 'tis not by the grace of God alone, that they are quickened and regenerated, because he knows not that Infants have the like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred habits infused into them.</p>
            <p>We say the same with worthy Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> in <hi>Page</hi> 78. of his Book; which you recite in the <q>24th. <hi>Page</hi> of yours, <hi>viz.</hi> that Union between Christ and the Soul is fully accomplished by Christ giving the Spirit of Faith to us, even before we can Act Faith in the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him; because by this grace or Spirit of Faith, the Soul is inclined to an active receiving of Christ.</q> What of this? tho' 'tis thus in the <hi>Adult,</hi> must this Spirit of Faith or the Habit of Faith be therefore in Infants of Relievers also? Sir, let me ask you two or three questions here before I leave this.</p>
            <p>Is Regeneration in your Infants that are Regenerated, the fruit or product of that Spirit of Faith or Habits which you plead for, to be infused into them when Infants? sure if they had any such Habits, when Infants, they need no other inspired Habits when they are grown up.</p>
            <p>2. I would know since you speak only of those habits to be in Believers Infants, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were infused before they were born or after?</p>
            <p>3. Seeing some Infants of Infidels or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers may be elected, nay and it appears to us by Gods working upon the Hearts of such when grown up, (that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in his electing love) had not they likewise when Infants habitual Faith and so an equal right to Baptism?</p>
            <p>
               <q>In <hi>Page</hi> 26 you say, <hi>all the Seed of Believers under the Gospel do partake of all the benefite and priviledges of the Covenant of Grace, as much as ever the Seed of professing Jews did under the Law.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I say so too; and more: All our Children partake of greater benefits and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Gospel of the New Covenant than theirs did of it, under the Law, (as to


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59964:9"/>
outward dispensation and revelation) when grown up, set under the clear and plain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and Ministration of it: But of what this, <q>therefore say you, they have as good, a right to the initiating Seal or Token of the Covenant, namely Baptism, as ever the Jews Children had to the initiating Seal of the Covenant,</q> namely Circumcision.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> You go too fast; how do you prove that Baptism is an initiating Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, some call it an initiating rite into the visible Church, but is it indeed an Ordinance of initiation into the Covenant of Grace; then your Infants are not in the Covenant before Baptized, I know nothing to be the Seal of the Covenant but the Holy Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13, 14. and <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 30. as touching Circumcision, that was I grant a rite that belonged to the Male Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, if it was ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating it, only let them into that <hi>National Church,</hi> but I doubt not but that the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh, were all both Males &amp; Females Born Members of that Church.</p>
            <p>2. We shall prove by and by, that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision did not appertain unto the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; read the Arguments in the 1st and 2d. Part <hi>of the Ax layd to the Root of the Trees:</hi> And when you write again answer them, for you have not touched one of them; yet Sir you have a great deal of Work cut out all ready for you, before this comes to your Hand. But to proceed, you in <hi>page</hi> 26. go on to prove what you have asserted, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That it is so (say you) <hi>doth clearly appear from our Saviour Christs carriage and department towards those little Children that were brought to him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>You say those Children were the Children of believers.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny it, se how you are able to prove it, there is no such thing recorded of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were the Children of believers: <q>again, <hi>page</hi> 27. you say <hi>Christ did bless them with spiritual blessings.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Friend, may not you be found (as far as you know) to assert false things of Jesus Christ? Is it said he blessed them with spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blessings? but since you know so well, pray what spiritual blessings were they? You confess he did not Baptize them; did he them give them habitual Faith for that blessing you plead for to be in Infants? <hi>Reader,</hi> 'Tis evident Christs way of healing the Sick, was by putting or laying his Hand on such, how do we know but it was the blessing of healing, he prayed for, and blessed them with? but Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> tells us; <hi>God out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings hath perfected his praise,</hi> page 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Now you have hit it. I do not doubt but those Babes, out of whose Mouths God hath perfected his praise, but that they had more than habitual Faith.

            <p>2. If Children be part of their Parents, then certainly if the Parents go to Heaven all their Children must likewise, for the Whole of believers shall be saved, not a Part of them only.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I utterly deny that Child, or those little Children, who are positively said to be believe in Christ, to be Infants.</p>
            <p>1. For 'tis expresly said, Christ <hi>called that Child to him</hi> he was able to come, no doubt whom Christ called: Could an Infant do that?</p>
            <p>2. To put the matter out of doubt, 'tis evidentas to matter of fact, God hath in our days wrought by his Spirit, savingly on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral little Children, some three or four years old, others about six or seven, as Mr. <hi>Jenaway</hi> in <hi>his token for little Children</hi> shews and names the Children: Now it might be such a little Child Christ called to him, and who did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in him, and 'tis such little Children he speaks of that do believe in him, who are able to believe; but what is this to prove In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o believe and are able to believe. If this be so, you need not plead only for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Faith to be in them, for now you think you have proved they have Faith it self, for believing refers not only to the habit, but to the act also.</p>
            <p>3ly. Besides, if we may not conclude they were such little Children, yet (as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> observes and divers others) it may intend such believers who have such and such quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are in young Children, <hi>viz. harmless, humble, Innocent, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>in malice be you Children.</hi>

                  <hi>From hence you say,</hi> 535. <hi>that it appears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly that little Children of believing Parents are Church Members, and have an indubitable right unto the Ordinance of Baptism, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I grant those little Children who do believe in Christ, have an indubitable right to Baptism and to the Lords Supper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as soon as they are Baptised: But not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>In Page</hi> 28. <hi>You say that Timothy was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised when he was a Child.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I am subject to think he was very young when he did first believe and was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, may be he was a Child; but prove he was Baptised when he was an Infant and I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Pedo Baptist.</hi> And since his Mother and Grand-Mother were both believers, no doubt had he been Baptised when an Infant Christ would have left it upon Record, to have put an end to this controversie, which he knew and foresaw in after times would arise.</p>
            <p>But this is no whereto be found, so that you are wiser then what is written.</p>
            <p>2. But Sir, are your Infants Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with you; doth the Church you belong unto consists of such as of the Adult?</p>
            <p>I thought none accounted their Infants to be Church Members but those who are for national Churches; Infant Baptism seem as if it was continved according to the nature of such a constitution, and not for a Gospel Church constitution, which consisteth only of a Congregation of godly Men and W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>men.</p>
            <p>In Page 34. You positively affirm, <hi>this is the Church of which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Seed of Believers, are Members as much now as ever the</hi> Jews, <hi>Children were under the Law. For it is the same Church state, tho' in another dress or under another dispensation. Our Saviour did not destroy the Church state when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>communicated the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> Jews &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> I thought that the Church you are a Member of was congregational, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and I am satisfied that it is so, and that they do own no national Church to be a true Church of Christ, I mean such that consisteth of Parents; and their Children as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law in the national Church of the Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59964:10"/>2. I deny that all or any Infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are Members of the Gospel Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; prove it if you can; and also I do affirm the State or Constitution of the Gospel Church, is not the same now as it was under the Law: 'Tis evident all the Jewish Infants were born Members of that Church; it being <hi>national.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the Church is <hi>built up of living Stones</hi> consisting of the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> only, not of the natural or carnal Seed of Believers.</p>
            <p>And I am perswaded, tho' your. <hi>Reverend Pastor</hi> is for Infant Baptism, yet he will not allow of what you here affirm.</p>
            <p>But Sir, if your Infants are all born Church Members, How can Baptism be an initiating rite to them. I allow not, nor you neither, any person to be a right regular member of a Gospel Church until Baptized: But you, in page 35. say, that little Children of believing Parents are Church Members, and so seem to argue for their being Baptized; but if all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Seed are born Church Members, ours are as good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church Members as yours, tho' not Baptized.</p>
            <p>You in the last place seem greatly to miss the matter in one great case, <hi>viz.</hi> you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish not between the visible and invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church under the Law: The invisible Church is but one and the same in every age, that consisteth only of all the elect; we grant, but the visible Church is not the same now as it was under the Law.</p>
            <p>That the whole State and Constitution of the national Church of <hi>Israel</hi> or natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is gone and dissolved, your learned Brethren will not deny, and there is no nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church in its room constituted by our Lord Jesus Christ. So that 'tis not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of the <hi>Jewish</hi> only, but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute dissolution of their Church State, as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and many others assert.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In page 99, 100, &amp;c. <hi>you again positively declare, that the State of the Christ is the same now as it was under the Law, and hath the same Attributes, and made of the same ingredients, and hath the same Titles, and lives upon the same Food, and was a Baptized Church, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You proceed to make these things to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>1. You begin with the Attributes of the Church under the Law. <hi>viz. if you obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> Tho' they upon their obedience and keeping Gods Covenant had such promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet 'tis evident that they were a National Church: God took the whole House of <hi>Israel</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a visible External Covenant Church State, and as so considered separated them from all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and People in the World, to be a peculiar <hi>people and Treasure</hi> (in that Covenant) <hi>unto himself;</hi> and in this sense, he was said fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or by Covenant to be Married to the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> and became an Husband, to them; see <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. God there made a promise to <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judab, viz.</hi> I will make <hi>a new Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant I made with y ur Fathers in the day that I took them by the Hand, to bring them out of the Land of Egypt, which Covenant they broke, although I was an Husband to them, saith the Lord,</hi> v. 32. Now in that Covenant God made with them when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he gave them their Legal Church State and many External Earthly Blessings, Laws and carnal Ordinances; and like as a Husband cares and provides for the Wife, so did God care and provide for them and preserve them so long as that Law (I mean the Law of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) did continue: But that <hi>Law is now dead, Rom.</hi> 7.4. And God is now no longer such a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to them: Nor hath he Married any other External Nation or People (as so considered) in the World: But now God in the Gospel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is an Husband indeed to them he was a Typical Husband; nor is the Gospel Church Married to the Lord by that old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Covenant Law, but by the new Covenant, which <hi>is not according to the old:</hi> Moreover, they not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Covenant were not such <hi>a peculiar treasure</hi> to the Lord, as Believers are to him in the New Covenant: Christ hath undertook for all the true members of his mystical Body, they are married to him for ever and they are to him an Eternal excellency, therefore the legal Jewish visible Church differed from the Gospel Church—Yet</p>
            <p>2. I also grant that all those under the Law who were members of the invisible Church, or elect ones, were as choice a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to God as any Believers are now, and in the like safe condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59964:11"/>3. 'Tis evident that the legal Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was not made up of the same matter, or ingredients, as the Gospel Church is; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Institution of the Gospel Church, none ought to be made members of it but Believers only. But in the Jewish Church the fleshy or carnal Seed were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods ordination and appointment, God did allow of the fleshy Seed as such then to be members of that Church, but he doth not allow of such to be in the Gospel Church.</p>

               <q>You mention, in <hi>Page</hi> 100. <hi>that in</hi> Exod. 25. 31. <hi>And thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure Gold, &amp;c.</hi> and you hint this was the <hi>Church and the ordinances of God: And therefore the ingredients are the same under the Gospel as the Church was under the Law.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I Though the Candlestick of pure Gold had been a shaddow or Figure of some thing to come, and that it referred not to the legal Church, but to the Church under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and this being so, how can this prove that Church consisted of the same matter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients as the Gospel Church does?</p>
            <p>
               <q>3. You say that <hi>the Church of God under the Mosaick Law, lived upon the same Spiritual Food as the Church of Christ doth now,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Page</hi> 93.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> All that were of the mystical Body of Christ then, 'tis true, did feed on the same spiritual food.</p>
            <p>2. But pray consider what you say. Can any of those that feed on the Flesh of Christ and drink his Blood, perish? for 'tis evident, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who (are said to) Eat of the same spiritual Meat, and drank the same spiritual Drink, perished in the Wilderness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>3. They all Eat the same <hi>Manna</hi> that <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> did, which is called Heavenly or Spiritual Meat, and Drank of the Water out out of the Rock that was a Typ, of Christ, The <hi>Jews,</hi> say our <hi>Annotators,</hi> Eat the same Spiritual Meat that we do now; they in the Type, we in the Antitype; they as a Church had but the Shell comparatively, and we the Kernel: they had the shadow, we the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; their Ordinances were called <hi>Carnal Ordinances</hi> and their promises Earthly, ours are Spiritual Ordinances, and better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Therefore the Church under the Gospel does not feed on the same food which the Church did under the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <q>4. You say the <hi>Church under the Law was Baptised, Men Women and Children. And there can be no true Church but what is so now.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> You mistake, the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church was no Baptized Church, they had no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptism, this was but a Typical Baptism; but if they were) <hi>as they passed through the Sea</hi>) Baptised, and yet only <hi>Sprinkled, by Rain faling upon them from the Cloud,</hi> then you will make the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> all Anabaptists, for they were all Sprinkled after they passed through the Sea, see <hi>Exod.</hi> 24 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>9.</p>
            <p>'Tis evident you by this render them to be all Rebaptised, should what you say be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>2. But Sprinkling is not Baptising; nor was that a real, but a Typical Baptism, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they passed through the Sea; nor was their Children any more Baptised, than was that <hi>mixt People</hi> which were with them; for so 'tis said and much Cattel also: But that Typical Baptism bears great Analogy with Dipping, as Mr. <hi>Pools</hi> Annotations well observes on the <q>place. The Apostle useth that term in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard (say they) of the great Analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Baptism (as it was used) the persons going down into the Waters and being Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in them, and the <hi>Israelites</hi> going down into the Sea, the great receptacle of Water; tho' the Water at that time was gathered on heaps on either side of them, yet they seemed buried in the Water.</q> This they give (from some) as the most probable sense of the place. And,</p>
            <p>This being so you need not call the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> to wonder at, what you thought you had got here.</p>
            <p>Do you think that among the <hi>Jews</hi> that passed through the Sea, there were not some Unbelievers as well as among that mixt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; will you plead for the Baptising of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and ungodly persons? for this will justify their being Baptised as far forth as that of the Infant Seed of Believers.</p>

               <q>Again, he saith, <hi>Page</hi> 93. the National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> with all the Ordinances of it, being removed and taken away the Lord Christ, hath appointed particular Churches or united Assemblies of Believers, <hi>&amp;c. See Reverend</hi> Mr. <hi>Fords Gospel Church</hi> opened, Chap. 1. <hi>Page</hi> 5. where he gives a right discription of a Gospel Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> a society of Godly Christians who give themselves first to the Lord and then to one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In Chap. 3. <hi>Page</hi> 22. he shews the matter <q>of a Gospel Church more fully, and that it doth consist only, of regenerate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted persons: Such as are Married to, and have put on Christ, such that are saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and powerfully enlightned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened, quickened, and convinced of Sin, of Righteousness,</q> and Judgment.</p>

               <q>Again, he saith, it is spoken of the Ministry of <hi>John Baptist, which did burn as an Oven,</hi> and left them neither the Root of <hi>Abrahams Covenant,</hi> nor the Branches of their own good works; he cutteth them off from the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> and so by cutting them off from the root, he leaveth them no ground to trust to, <hi>Page</hi> 21, 22. you say <hi>the new creature in the Womb, or in the Cradle, is as perfect and compleat in all its lineaments as in the oldest Saint on Earth,</hi> Page 40. &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Sir, do not mistake your self, if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are any of them regenerated in the Womb, then Regeneration in them is the first, birth but Regeneration is a being born again, or a second Generation which is wrought by the Holy Spirit, therefore it can't proceed from believing Parents in any wise, they can by their Faith contribute nothing to the second Birth: Now shew at what time 'tis that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is wrought in your Infants. O take heed; for tho' God doth regenerate the Souls of dying Infants, that are saved. Yet what is this to the Infants of Believers, as such?</p>
            <p>Besides, if <hi>John Baptist,</hi> or <hi>Jeremiah the Prophet</hi> were Regenerated in the Womb, or any other Infants, then it would follow they were not born Children of wrath as others: Nor could their Regeneration be called <hi>a being born again</hi> (as I hinted before) but their first Birth must be so called.</p>
            <p>You I see apply those Scriptures where our Lord Jesus Speaks of the Adult, to Infants, as that, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>John.</hi> 3. 3. So that

            </p>
            <p>1. The Adult (except Ideots) are not saved without the Act and exercise of Faith, dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are. 2ly. The Adult are not saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actual repentance, but dying Infants are, 3ly. The Adult are not saved without Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Sin, taking up the Cross, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of Christ. But Infants are saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of these, or any other Sacred Acts of obedience whatsoever; and yet will you say the way (as to the Mode or manner) of the Salvation of dying Infants, differs in no one point from Adult persons: How will you prove that 'tis the habit of Faith, and not the Act of Faith, that applies Christs merits and Righteousness to the Soul in adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it not from the habit, the Soul is enabled to believe, and say hold on Christ; and is it not thus that Christ saves the Adult, and doth he just so and in the same mode or manner save dying Infants?</p>
            <p>As to the producing one Text in the Case, I say the Holy Ghost is wholly silent as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way or manner of the application of Christs merits, to dying Infants, or how their sinful natures are sanctified; yet that the modes differ in many respects, as I have shewed, is evident.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> acknowledg the same, <hi>viz.</hi> that Infants are not <hi>able to perform Faith and Repentance,</hi> the two great prerequisits of Baptism, by <hi>reason of their tender age,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have found out sureties to ingage for them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 57. you greatly abuse Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi> in saying that he allows not Elect dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants, to be in the Covenant of Grace. Doth it follow, because he denies the Infants of believers, as such, to be in the Covenant of grace, therefore he denies elect Infants to be in the Covenant of Grace? Sir, you ought, not to bear false witness against your neighbour, as you have done; he will tell you and hath told, you that all that are saved, are in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> Pray note how disengenuous this Man seems to be, and how he hath strangely encumbred the present controversie, in talk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of habitual grace in dying; Infants for what is that to the purpose, since he refers not to such Infants of believers that live? he himself acknowledges that all their Infants who live have not the habit of Faith: Nor can he prove any of them have it, or such that die either; therefore unless no other but dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were baptized by the <hi>Pedo Baptists,</hi> this can no ways concern the controversie.</p>
            <p>2. Consider, that since those supposed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits in Infants of believers, do not appear to us, nor do we know which they are, what ground it there to Baptise any of them? For what appears not is not (as to us) Shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d we Baptise any Adult persons in whom no Fruit, Sign, or demonstration of Faith appears than what appears in Infants, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we should be worthy of the greatest blame imaginable: For 'tis evident that in all whosoever that are the true subjects of Baptism, ought the habits of Faith not only to be, but the Act, confession and fruits of it also. True, we might plead thus; what tho' we see no fruits of Faith in some, yet they may be elected, and the habit of Faith may be in them: Nay, this allowed, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may Baptise all the Infants of Believers promiscuously, supposing some are true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and have habitual Faith, why say, I may they not also Baptise (by the same argument)


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59964:12"/>
the Infants of Infidels or Unbelievers, since among them may be some elected allo; and if so, why not as much the habit of Faith as any Elect Infant of Believers?</p>
            <p>To conclude with this, take three or four Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. That which cannot be proved of this nature from the word of God, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being directly or indirectly spoken about it, is absur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d and vain for any person to assert.</p>
            <p>But it cannot be proved from the word of God that one Infant of Believers or any other, have habitual Faith; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing directly or indirectly spoken about it, <hi>ergo</hi> 'tis absurd and vain for any person to assert that any Infant of Believer hath habitual Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. 'Tis forbid, and a sinful thing for any to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y into Gods secrets: All they that pry into the way how God applies the merits of Christ to dying Infants, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth them, do pry into God, Secrets, <hi>ergo</hi> 'tis forbid and a sinful thing to pry into that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Text says positively, secret Things belong unto God, not unto us That is, such secret things which God hath not made known to his dearest Children; for we deny not but some things that were kept secret, are now revealed, and some things also that are made known to the godly, are kept secret from the wicked; hence 'tis, said <hi>the Secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him, and he will shew them his Covenant, Psal.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 14. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace that is hid from others is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to believers, they understand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Blessings, and duties of it; they know no person can be saved but by the Grace of God in this Covenant, nor without the merits of Christ and Sanctification: But yet how the merits of Christ or the blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is applyed to Infants that die, or how they are Sanctified is no where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the godly (therefore one of Gods Secrets) if this Man knows it, let him shew where it is written, or hath he it by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</p>
            <p>
               <q>But this Man says <hi>Page</hi> 129. That the Salvation of all the Elect is revealed; and Christ saith, <hi>there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and hid that shall not be known.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Sure those words must be taken with restriction, for there are many things not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> revealed, and tho' it is revealed that all the Elect are saved and Sanctified by Christ, yet shew me where 'tis revealed or made known that Infants have habitual Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. They who have had an Habit of Faith infused into them, can never lose it.</p>
            <p>But such Infants that live may lose your supposed Habit of Faith; Therefore.</p>
            <p>Such Infants never had an Habit of Faith infused into them. For proof of the Major Proposition, See 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. The Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 23. I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Those Infants who have your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Habit of Faith infused into them are Regenerated, and when grown up to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, need no other Regeneration: But those Infants when erown up to maturity do need Regeneration; Therefore.</p>
            <p>Those Infants have no such Habit of Faith infused into them.</p>
            <p>If he should say those habits infused in Infancy do regenerate their Soul, let him prove it: How doth it come to pass then that some of the Children of Believers are not regenerated till they are (may be) 30 or 40 or 50 years old? Strange that such habits should be in them, and yet lie asleep so long, and evil habits predominate in them till that time.</p>
            <p>This Man in <hi>Page</hi> 45. positively affirms, that some Children have had Faith tho' he cannot prove any Infants have it that are now living:</p>
            <p>If he by Children means Infants, I do deny, it, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d him prove what he says, for the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Text he mentions in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 41. proves no such, thing: What tho` the Babe <hi>leaped in the Womb of Elizabeth,</hi> doth that prove the Babe had faith or the habit of it? Neither doth that in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>What tho' St. <hi>Paul</hi> was perswaded that <hi>Timothy</hi> had when an Adult person, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned saith that was in his Gran mother <hi>Lois,</hi> and in his Mother <hi>Eunice</hi> doth that prove he had the habit of Faith in him when an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant?</p>
            <p>If you say that the habit of Grace may be in a person, and yet nor appear, act nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or dispose the person according to the nature and quality of it, you may as well say there may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a principle of life in a person and yet he may be dead, or have no Life, Sense, feeling, or motion in him; or there may be

Fire, and no Heat, a Sun and no light, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and no moisture; also you contradict all Divines and wise Men in the World in their notions about a habit of Grace or vital Principle: they say where these habits are there is Divine Life, there is a Spirit of love and other Graces, whereby as their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s are possessed with knowledg of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Gods ways, so their wills are sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned by the power of those habits, and as <q>the old nature is the habit of Sin, so the new nature is the habit of Grace; where the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Faith is, they tell you there is a ready disposition to every good work, and as 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in respect of disposition so it is in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of motion, yea that 'tis naturally active according to its Divine nature; and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary active. And where these habits are there is a kind of natural necessity of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from life and habit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now if these habits do remain in any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers that live: How comes it to pass there is none of these effects and Operations, but the direct contrary till new habits be infused?</q>
            </p>
            <p>If you say these habits may be quite lost, then there is a possibility of falling quite from true Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reverend Dr. Owen in his discourse of the Holy Spirit,</hi> Page 416. saith, <q>That the habit of Grace is a vertue, a Power, a Principle of Spiritual Life, wrought, created, infused into our Souls, and laid in all the faculties of them constantly abiding and unchangeably residing in them.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And again saith, this abideth always in, and with all that are sanctified.—And hereby are they prepared, disposed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled unto all duties of obedience.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see that there is not in any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Relievers that live, any habit of Faith, and if you still affirm it you will run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Rock or another which will sink your Ship down to the bottom without remedy.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Doth Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> question the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of God, because he affirms Infants are morally uncapable of those ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Faith which are in Adult persons? What cannot God do? no doubt he that placed in Infants the Seed or habit of natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, will, affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can inspire Infants with the habits of Divine Grace, nay, and as easily bring those Natural and Divine habits in their Infancy when infused, into Acts and Exercise also, according to their distinct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Operations as in the Adult: But for any to assert that God doth this is the business, and 'tis that which we do deny, and say, God infuses no such habits into any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants (that we know of) who are out of a moral capacity to Act and improve those ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, according as they dispose, incline, and impower all that have them.</p>

And let it be also considered whether this Man doth not go about <hi>to limit the holy one of Israel:</hi> When he argues that because God saves and sanctifies the Adult by infusing the habits of Grace into them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that therefore God must that way and no other, sanctify and apply the Blood and righteousness of Christ to dying Infants.</p>
            <p>We know that Men can differently apply the same medicine to a sick person, and yet it shall have the same effect in curing: So (say we may God some other way apply Christs merits to dying Infants and sanctify them (which we know not of) besides his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing the same habits which believers are inspired withall, who is a free agent and whose ways are wonderful and past finding out.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Proving that Infants of Believers, as such, are not in the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and that there was a twofold Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> one that peculiarly referred to his Natural Seed, as such; and the other to his Spiritual Seed, as such; with a full Answer and Confutation of what Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> hath said in his last reply to Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and to <hi>Benjamin Keach,</hi> in his Treatise, <hi>The Ax lay'd to the Root,</hi> about the Covenant of Grace, and that of Circumcision.</head>
            <p>I Shall pass by several things in your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, because they are over, and over, fully answered, in our late Treatise wrote on this Controversie, as that in <hi>page</hi> 44. of your Book concerning <hi>Federatal Holiness,</hi> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. See our Answer to the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> and <hi>Rector Rectified,</hi> and that in <hi>page</hi> 71. about the promise, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>This first of all the Reader is desired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of, and that carefully, that our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary hath dealt very unfairly with my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Brother Collins,</hi> I hope it is through his Ignorance or great oversight, <hi>viz.</hi> first, he posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively concludes and takes it for granted, that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath endeavoure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rove the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace which God made with, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promis`d to <hi>Abraham</hi> is dissannulled and taken away. Secondly, that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> by his often repeated distinction of <hi>the Covenant of peculiarity God made with</hi> Abraham, doth mean and intend the Covenant of Grace, when this is as far from his intention and expressions any where in his Book or Judgment, as the East is from to the West: I have seen many Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in Controvertible Points, but never saw any (except one) abuse his Antagonist worse, nor after such a sort; 'tis evident there was two Covenants contained in those trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actings of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> one <hi>peculiarly</hi> respected only his Natural Seed or Off-spring, as such, which Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> calls the Covenant of peculiarity, (as others have done before him) which Circumcision was a Sign of, and this he hath proved, was not the Covenant of Grace which God promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> for the Covenant of Grace God Promised to him, did not peculiarly relate to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed that were Elect Persons; but to all the Gentiles also, who believe in Christ; for that comprehends none but the Elect, or the true Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as such. Reader, if you read Mr. <hi>Colline</hi> first Book, or his answer to Mr. <hi>Shute,</hi> you will find this is as plainly layd down by him, as any thing could well be: I am afraid that this Man`s over heated Zeal would not suffer him distinctly to read over, and seriously weigh, what Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath wrote and said upon this account, before he attempted to write an Answer, for thro' this gross mistake (as one that hath read Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> Book, observed and told me) he hath wrote near twenty Leaves to no purpose, <hi>i. e.</hi> to prove that which no body denys, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Covenant of Grace God promised to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> is not dissolved, cast out, or disannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but abides the same forever, which we all as stedfastly believe as Mr. <hi>Shute,</hi> therefore he has but set up here on this respect, a Man of Straw, and then fights with it; And upon search and examination of Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> reply, I see that what the Gentleman told me is very true, and that those Leaves do begin about 74th. <hi>page</hi> and so on: And in the said 74th. <hi>page</hi> Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> begins with this easie assay, <hi>viz.</hi> To prove the Covenant of Grace God made with (or rather promised unto) <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> abideth for ever and ever, he urgeth that blessed Text <hi>Psalm</hi> 89. 34, 35, &amp;c. <hi>My Covenant I will not break, nor alter the thing that in gone out of my Lips; once have I sworn by my my Holiness that I will not lye unto</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Do we say or Imagin, that the promise of the Covenant of Grace God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is abrogated? God forbid: for that stands firm for ever and ever, as the Spring of all our comfort and consolation in Life and Death, being confirmed by the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> who cannot lie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 13. 15, 16, 17, 18. and so doth the Invisible and Mystical Church, or Body of Christ, remain and abide for ever

also, against which the <hi>Cates of Hell</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevail.</p>
            <p>But the question is, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or no, there was not a Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Natural Seed, (or Off-spring) as such, <hi>viz</hi> a Covenant that only, did belong or appertain to the Jews, in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Gentiles, nor their Seed, as such, were concerned, of which Circumcision was a Sign, for this is that which we affirm.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, observe Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> Reply in his 76. <hi>page viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Natural Branches are broken off, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Childrens visible in Covenanting is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed: thus Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> Take the Answer as followeth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now Sir you shall see, saith Mr. <hi>Shute, That this doth no more prove, that the Children of believing Parents, were cast out of the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Covenant which God made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>than,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> By the Everlasting Covenant, you mean the Covenant of Grace, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Friend, we say all the Elect Infants of believers, or of unbelievers were Included in that Covenant, and they are not, nor can they be cast out of it: But you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the Argument, `tis not about the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed, but the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> the Controversie lies not, about who are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Invisible, but who are Members of the Visible Church in Gospel days; the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is about Childrens <hi>Visible in Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> I am sorry you distinguish no better, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you do not see where the Stress of the Point lies, or else will not see it.</p>
            <p>I ask you whether there was no Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that belonged to his Natural Seed as such only? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumcision did not belong to that Covenant, and so a Covenant of Peculiarity? <hi>i. e.</hi> in which Gentile believers, and their Seed were no ways concerned; was not Christ to come only of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, according to the flesh? Besides, if this were not so, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision could not be said to be an advantage to the Jews, (upon the account of the Law) above the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. is it not said <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nto them</hi> (that is, the Jews) <hi>appertained the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. is not here more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants than one? 'tis not <hi>Covenant,</hi> but <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants:</hi> Now the Covenant of Circumcision that belonged to them, as they were the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (tho' wicked Persons) and so did the giving of the Law and Service of God under that dispensation: but the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace</hi> belongs only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed. <hi>First</hi> such of them that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Loyns; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> those of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> also that were comprehended in Gods Election of Grace; hence Christ saith, <hi>he was not sent, but to the lost Sheep of the House of</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, that is, to all that God hath given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, <hi>not sent,</hi> that is not <hi>first,</hi> the promise runs first <hi>to</hi> the Jews, <hi>to the Jews first, and also to the Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 1. 16.</p>
            <p>1. Let this therefore be carefully conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>viz.</hi> that God made a twofold Covenant or two Covenants with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed one a formal Covenant, the other held forth in promise, which by and by I shall further evince.</p>
            <p>2. That the Gospel Covenant run first to all the Elect that were the Natural off-spring of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then to the Gentiles, and from hence 'tis said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. That when the Jews are called and brought in again, they shall be grafted into <hi>their own Olive-Tree.</hi> Their own because the Covenant of Grace or Gospel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, first in the blessings of it, was to them or to such amongst them, that were Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. 2. Because the true <hi>Olive</hi> doth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>rnal pupose and free Grace; Peculiarity belong to all the Elect and called ones of God,—but</p>
            <p>3. Let it be consider'd that there was a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant of Peculiarity also, made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Carnal Seed, as such in which <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> the <hi>Land of</hi> Canaan, the <hi>giving sorib of the Law on Mount</hi> Sinai, their <hi>Visible Church,</hi> and <hi>Church-membership,</hi> and all the <hi>Statures, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> and <hi>Services of the Law did appertain,</hi> and this brings me to what Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> hath said by way of answer to my Sermon on <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h.</hi> 3. <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the Root of the Trees.</hi> Where I do not only assert, but prove that two Covenants were continued in Gods Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions with <hi>Abraham;</hi> but first observe, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his abuses and misconstructions of my words, as in <hi>page</hi> 115. as if I had left out on purpose the 7. <hi>verse</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where the Covenant of Circumcision is called, <hi>an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Covenant.</hi> 'Tis evident I did not only mention that <hi>verse,</hi> but answered Mr. <hi>Flavels</hi> Argument drawn there from, as in <hi>part 2. page</hi> 13. But still he affirms positively again that in all my Discourse, I have not so much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this, <hi>viz. an Everlasting Covenant,</hi> and so compares me with the Devil, who left out part


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59964:14"/>
of a Scripture; see his Book <hi>page</hi> 116. Now this being a matter of Fact, let such who are in Communion with him consider it, for if they read my Sermons, <hi>page</hi> 13, 14. they will see that 'tis a great untruth. What tho' I left it out at such times when the writing it was not to my purpose in Hand, seeing I mention it at another, and answer what our opponents draw there from? In <hi>page</hi> 117. he says, <hi>If there</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>were two Covenants made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>then there would have been three Covenants in being at once, two of Works, and one of Grace.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> This I have fully answered in those Sermons <hi>called, the Ax layd at the Root,</hi> see <hi>page 14, 15, 16, 18. Second Part.</hi> Thus you will find I express my self, <hi>viz.</hi> Tho' there is but one Covenant of Work's yet there was more than one <hi>Addition</hi> or <hi>Administration</hi> of the said Covenant. This is evident, altho' given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a different End, Purpose, and Design by the Lord: The Covenant of Works was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made with <hi>Adam;</hi> yet another addition or ministration of it, was given on <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and to that Covenant, I there prove Circumcision did appertain, <hi>Ax 2d. Part page</hi> 17, 18. Also I there shewed that tho' there is but one Covenant of Grace, yet there were several distinct Additions or Administrations of that. Also, in <hi>page</hi> 125. he misrepresents my words again, he cites an Objection I mention in <hi>page 25. part</hi> 1. viz.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If Infants as such were not included in the Covenant of Grace God made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>how can dying Infants be saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Answer is, <hi>Must Infants of believers, as such, be comprehended in that Covenant, God made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>or else can they not be saved? how then were any dying Infants saved before</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's <hi>days, or before the Covenant was made with him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Now Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> says, <hi>page 125. That I have answered this Objection; as if there had been no Covenant of Grace before that time God did declare and make that Covenant with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I will appeal to all Men, whether or no the very purport of my Answer is not to signifie that the Covenant of Grace was from the beginning, made primarly with Christ before the World begun for us, and that those Infants that were saved before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s time, were saved by the said Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, otherwise I had said nothing; the very Stress of my Argument lyes upon that foot of account.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 132. Mr. <hi>Shute he says if God made two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Covenants with</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed, then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>There must be that in the one that is peculiar to his Spiritual Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>There must be that in the other that is peculiar to his Carnal Seed; but we find</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is altogethor unscriptural; for</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Both the Seeds of</hi> Abraham <hi>had a right to all the External Benefits and Priviledges of the everlasting Cevenant which God made with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>very few excepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I have largely proved in the said Sermons called, <hi>The Ax layd to the Root,</hi> That there were some things in one peculiar to his Spiritual Seed, that no ways related to his Carnal Seed, as such, which proved the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contained in promise to be distinct, <hi>page</hi> 15, 16. and some things in the other that belonged to his Natural Seed, that appertains not to his Spiritual Seed, as such, of which this Man takes no notice.</p>
            <p>I begin there with those things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Abrahams,</hi> Natural Seed, as such, as peculiar to them.</p>
            <p>1. The first that I Name, is, <hi>That of Gods multiplying his Seed by</hi> Isaac.</p>
            <p>2. The Birth of <hi>Isaac</hi> by <hi>Sarah Abraham,s</hi> Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 16, 19.</p>
            <p>3. The continuation of his Covenant, with all that should proceed from <hi>Isaac</hi> according to the Flesh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 6.</p>
            <p>4. The coming of Christ out of <hi>Isaac</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Flesh.</p>
            <p>5. The bringing the Natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by <hi>Isaac</hi> out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The promise of giving his Natural Seed the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for their Possession. Now can any of these things concern, or belong to <hi>Abraham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Spiritual Seed, as such, that is, do they concern us Gentiles who do believe?</p>
            <p>Observe also, that as these things pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly appertained to his Natural Seed, as such; so Circumcision is expresly called Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Gen. 17. <hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant, every Man Child among you shall be Circumcised,</hi> verse 10. <hi>And ye shall Circumcise the Flesh of your Fore Skins, and it shall be a token of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and you,</hi> verse 8. <hi>And I will give unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee, the Land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou art a Stranger, all the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 8. Now this Covenant and these promises I affirmed, cannot belong to the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as such, <hi>page</hi> 16. therefore a Covenant of peculiarity; to which he hath given no answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59964:15"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have shewed also what those things are, that are Peculiar to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and so to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed, as such, which Covenant only, was by promise, not a formal Covenant like the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Circumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.</p>
            <p>1. See Gen. 15. 5. <hi>Look towards Heaven, tell the Stars, if thou art able to Number them; and he said unto him, so shall thy Seed be; and he believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for Righteousness.</hi> This was not in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumcision, and referrs to <hi>Abraham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> numerous Spiritual Seed.</p>
            <p>2. So again, <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations;</hi> meaning Gentile Believers, as divers Expositors shew.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In thy Seed, shall all the Nations of the Earth be Blessed,</hi> Gen. 12. 3. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. I cited the Apostles words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>The Scripture foreseeing, that God would Justifie the Heathen, through Faith Preached the Gospel to</hi> Abraham, <hi>saying, in thy Seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be Blessed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis remarkable the Holy Ghost does not here refer to the Covenant of Circumcision, <hi>Gen</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10. But to the free promise of the Covenant of Grace, which <hi>Paul</hi> says positively <hi>Abraham</hi> received not in Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 10. <hi>Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>for Righteousness; how was it then reckoned, when he was in Circumcision, or in Uncircumcision? not in Circumcision, but in Uncircumcision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I desire it may be well considered by all Christians, that the Covenant of Grace, was only by promise, and no Formal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with any of the Saints under the Old Testament; thus the Covenant of Grace run to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. 11, 12. only by promise, not a Covenant, where there was a mutual restipulation between God and his Elect ones: As in the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, there was between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> in respect of his Carnal Seed; this Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> asserts also on <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>page</hi> 227.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When God renewed, saith he, the promise of it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is said to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, and he did so; but it was with respect unto other things; especially the proceeding of the promised Seed from his Loyns; but absolutely under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, it consisted only in a promise. 1. It wanted its solemn confirmation and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Blood of the only Sacrifice, which belonged to it. 2. This was wanting, saith he, the Spring, Rule, and Measure of all the Worship of the Church, this does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to every Covenant, properly so called, that God makes with his Church, that it be the entire Rule of all the Worship, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of it, which is that which they are to restipulate in their entrance into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God;</q> but so the Covenant of Grace was not under the Old Testament; <hi>thus</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is further confirmed by those expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. <hi>I will make a new Covenant with the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> clearly intimating he had not so made it before with any, except it was with Christ as our Head, Representive, and Mediator, with whom it was made for us, and in him with us, before the Foundation of the World, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Does not</hi> David <hi>say God had made with him an everlasting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I answer, <hi>David</hi> was a Type of Christ, <hi>Psalm</hi> 89, 28, 34, 35. with whom the Covenant of Grace was made before the World began, this therefore refers to the true <hi>David,</hi> who was only able to answer the Condition agreed upon, between the Father and himself as Mediator, <hi>For the Covenant of Peace was between them both,</hi> Zech. 6. 13. For unto us the Covenant of Grace is not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, but an Absolute Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Adam</hi> the promise runs <hi>The Seed of the Woman shall Bruise the Sepents Head,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Abraham, In thy Seed shall all the Families of the Earth be blessed.</hi> In both places it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only a gracious promise: <hi>To</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to his Seed the promise was made;</hi> it is not said Covenant, therefore when I say God made a <hi>Twofold Covenant with</hi> Abraham, I mean that there were two Covenants contained in those Covenant Transactings of God with him, one a <hi>Formal Covenant</hi> with him and his Carnal Seed, which contained a Covenant upon mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al restipulation, which was the Covenant of Circumcision, which <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Carnal Seed subscribed to the other a free promise or Covenant of Grace to him and all is true Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed, which is confirmed by Christs Blood, and which believers consent to, and enter into, when Baptized upon the profession of their Faith, in Gospel days, tho' I deny not, but that they have actual interest in it; as soon as they have Union with Christ, or do believe in him.</p>
            <p>Moreover it was through Faith only, in


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59964:15"/>
the free promise of Christ and in the Covenant of Grace that all the faithful were justified and saved who lived under the old Testament, tho' the Covenant it self was not then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a Covenant with them, it being not Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified nor confirmed by the Blood of Christ or Death of the Testator, nor could it so be till the typical Covenant was taken away.</p>
            <p>This being so it follows clearly that the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. was only a peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Typical Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his carnal Seed, in which, Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pardon of sin, Adoption, and Eternal Life was not contained, but in <hi>the free Promise only</hi> God made to him, that Covenant had in it; it is true, temporal Blessings, apolitical Church state and typical worship, and visible, legal Church Membership given to <hi>Israel</hi> in subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to the Gospel Covenant.</p>
            <p>And further to prove that the promise of the Covenant of Grace did not belong to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s natural Seed as such, <hi>Paul</hi> shews in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Now to Abraham and to his Seed was the promise made; he saith not to seeds, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of many; but to thy Seed, which is Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore saith he, vers. 29. <hi>and if ye be Christs, then are you Abrahams Seed, and heirs according to the promise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye must say I reckon from Christ, not from <hi>Abraham;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> misrepresents me here also, as if I set <hi>Abraham</hi> before Christ, when 'tis evident I intimated no other thing than this, <hi>i. e.</hi> you must see your selves first in Christ before you can reckon your selves to be <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Seed: Again, I cited <hi>Page</hi> 17. part, 1. that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. Neither because <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>they are the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> are they all Children, but in <hi>Isaac shall thy Seed be called,</hi> 7. <hi>That is, they which are the Children of the Flesh, these are not the Children of God. But the Children of the promise are counted for the Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can be more clear than this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as such (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here the Children of the Flesh) are not his Spiritual Seed to whom the Covenant of Grace doth belong unto, <hi>that is</hi> (saith the Apostle) They <hi>which are the Children of the Flesh,</hi> these are not he Children of God, that is, as such, or as simply so considered: For some of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> tho' not all, were the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the promise; for saith he, <hi>they are not all Israel that are of Israel,</hi> vers. 6.</p>
            <p>This Man meddles not with my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and what he catches up he generally wrongs and abuses me in, rendring me to speak that which I speak not nor, intended.</p>
            <p>But to proceed (he says) <hi>Page</hi> 132. <q>
                  <hi>Both the Seeds of Abraham had a right to all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal benefits and priviledges of the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, God made with Abraham, very few excepted.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> What few he means that are excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I know not; but if all the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> had right to all the external be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and priviledges of the external Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with him, then all believing Gentiles and their Elect Infants have, or had a right to circumcision, the giving of the Law, the possession of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all other rites of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>2. If by the everlasting Covenant he means the Covenant of Grace, then all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> natural Seed, as such, a few excepted, have or had a right to <hi>Baptism,</hi> the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> and all Gospel Churche-priviledges; and if so, why were the <hi>Saddu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Think not to say, saith John Baptist, within your selves, ye have Abraham to your Father,</hi> when they came to be Baptized; he proceeds to prove several things that none denys: A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Verses that concerned the point I had in hand, and have cited that Verse and answered it too, where circumcision is called an everlasting Covenant; see <hi>Ax laid to the Root</hi> and I will now recite what I there wrote.</p>
            <p>2. Part <hi>Page</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. viz. <hi>the Covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was called an everlasting Covenant.</hi> My Answer there to this, is as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> 'Tis not unknown to <hi>our Opponents</hi> that the word <hi>everlasting,</hi> sometimes signifies no more than a long continuance of time; and so extensive was the promise of Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar favours to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the original of their claim therefrom, that the severity of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aw afterwards given to them, was so far restrained as that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their manifold breach of Covenant with God and forfeture of all legal claims, of their right and priviledges in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> thereby, that they were never cut off from that good Land and ceased to be peculiar People unto God, until the End or period of that time determined by the Almighty was fully come: Which was at the Revelation of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssiah,</hi> and the setting up his Spiritual Temple under the Dispensation of the Gospel; and thus far the <hi>word everlasting</hi> doth extend. 'Tis said, God promised to give the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abrahhm</hi> and to his Seed for ever; and again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. for an everlasting inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whereas 'tis evident they have for many ages been disposessed of it. Nor may this seem strange if we consult other Texts where the same Terms are used with the like Restriction, for the Priesthood of <hi>Levi</hi> is called <hi>an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priesthood,</hi> Numb. 25. 13. And so the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to make an Atonement <hi>for the Holy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and for the Tabernacle</hi> and for the <hi>Altar,</hi> is <hi>called an everlasting Statute,</hi> Levit. 16. 34. Yet we know they all ended as did the Covenant of circumcision in Christ: See more in <hi>Page</hi> 14. <hi>Ax laid to the Root.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Now let any person see what blame this Man doth in Justice deserve for saying I have not mentioned the word <hi>everlasting</hi> in all my Book, viz. <hi>circumcision being called an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant;</hi> you also see, what little argument lies in that to prove the Covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision is a Gospel Covenant or appertaining to the Covenant of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, in those Sermons I laid down <hi>eleven arguments,</hi> proving that the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was part of the old legal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant God made with the <hi>Jews</hi> or the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> so not belonging to the Gospel Covenant, and because thou mayest not meet with them, I shall give thee here the heads or sum of them as followeth, see <hi>Page</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Because the Law or Covenant of circumcision was made, as to the design and end of it to separate the natural Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in their national Church state, from all other Nations, and to give them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> so that they might not mixt themselves with the Heathen.</p>
            <p>1. Will any say the Gospel Covenant or any precept of it; in the end and design of it, is institured to separate all believers and their fleshy Seed as a national Church from all other People in the World? if this be so, farewel to all Spiritual incorporated congregations of Christians. See Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Doth any Gospel ordinance assure us and our Children of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or any worldly and earthly Blessings, or is not the new Covenant established upon better promises?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Because some who were not in the Covenant of promise, had a positive right to, and where commanded of God to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, as <hi>Ishmael, Esau, &amp;c.</hi> and all the Male-Children, tho' wicked Mens Children that sprung from <hi>Isaac</hi> in their generations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> also some of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed were not to be circumcised, nor had they any right there too.</p>
            <p>1. As all his Male-Children who died before eight days old.</p>
            <p>2. All his Females, who were elected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and some others, who lived in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Days, as <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> and <hi>Lot, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Because some of <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed to whom circumcision did belong, were nevertheless denied Gospel Baptism; tho' their plea was <hi>Abraham is our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. From hence it follows, circumcision was no Gospel Law; for that which gave right to circumcision was not sufficient to give right to Gospel Baptism.</p>
            <p>2. It also appears that the Covenant of Grace, was not the adequate reason of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, but the mere positive command of God to <hi>Abraham;</hi> So that if they could prove the Children of believers in the Covenant of Grace, it would nevertheless be no argument to Baptise them, unless they had a command or ground from Christ so to do.</p>
            <p>For the Covenant God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> speaks nothing of Baptism. And had not our Blessed Saviour given it forth as an insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stution


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59964:16"/>
of the Gospel, we had never heard of it nor known it had been a duty or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, should we have read the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> a thousand times over: Therefore if all they say about the Infant Seed of Believers as such should be granted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Covenant of Grace that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> (which cannot) yet it would not follow from thence, Infants ought to be Baptized for, none ought to be Baptized but such that Christ's Commission and positive command, doth authorize so to be, which are none but those who by preaching, and the working of the Holy Ghost are made Disciples, or do believe; and make a confession of their Faith; in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mere positively right. We must always keep to the direct will and words of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver like as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in circumcision: No adding nor altering no pleading for Females to be circumcised, if Males only are expressed in the institution of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Circumcision could not be a Gospel rite, because all in the Gospel Church, 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said, <hi>shall know the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And shall not need to be taught to know him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now under the old <hi>Legal Covenant</hi> Infants were admitted Members of the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> who did not know the Lord, but had need when grown up to understanding to be taught to know him; in this the old Covenant dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the new; and old Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership from new Church Membership; for our Children before admitted into Gods Church, must know the Lord; we and they too must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or be made Disciples by teaching; we must know Christ or fix our Faith on him, in saving knowledg which Infants cannot do.</p>
            <p>To the last of these arguments he seems to say some thing; see <hi>Page</hi> 119. where he cites these words out of my Sermons, <hi>Page</hi> 21. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>in the old Covenant Infants were Members who did when taken into that Covenant and made members of that Legal Church, not know the Lord.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> says, <hi>here I mention but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and acknowledg Infants were in that one Covenant: So that he hath confused himself, and let him or any of their opinion prove by Scripture God did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast young Infants out of that one Covenant; he hath destroyed his two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants by thus contradicting himself; a Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his circumstances had need to have a good Memory.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> That Covenant which I mention was I tell you the Legal Covenant that God made with the whole Church and House of <hi>Israel,</hi> and how do I contradict my self? Infants I own were Members of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, and doth not the Scripture say, <hi>cast out the Bond woman and her Son,</hi> &amp;c. is not the old Covenant the <hi>Jewish</hi> Covenant gone? <hi>did not God take away the first, that he might establish the second?</hi> what Covenant is that which the Apostle says, is took away and difanulled? 'tis not you, will say, the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>I also ask you whether the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church that was founded upon that Old Covenant, is not gone and dissolved? if so what doth your arguing prove, nor is there a new Gospel na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church like the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> instituted in the room of the old? since you plead for Infants Church-membership, you must come to the new and last Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if Christ hath not willed Infants, their right to Baptism, and Church-membership in the Gospel, they can't have it by the former Testament which is disannulled.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Tou ask if faith and repentance was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired under the Law,</hi> Page 119.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I answer,</hi> Not to make any Members of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, you are in Page 120. 121. &amp;c. upon your old argument, that both young and old, Infants and the Adult are saved by faith: We have answered that already. Such that can believe, that Infants do believe or know the Lord, let them, I believe it not, nor can he nor all the Men of the World prove it. I shall repeat the substance of my other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prove that circumcision did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Because the Terms of it runs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Sinai Covenant,</hi> which is said not to be <hi>of Faith. But the Man that doth these things shall live in them,</hi> Gal. 3. 22. Life was promised to their obedience, death threatned to their disobedience: The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises were earthly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus runs the Covenant of circumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. <hi>Thou shalt keep my Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I will give to thee, and to thy Seed after thee, the Land of Canaan. And the uncircumcised Man-Child whose Flesh of his Fore-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>6. The covenant of circumcision was of the Letter and not of the Spirit that is, of the Law or first Testament, and not of the Gospel or second Testament, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 29.</p>
            <p>7. That Covenant in which Faith was not reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteousness, was


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59964:17"/>
not the Covenant of Grace, or Gospel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; but Faith was not reckoned to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in circumcision, <hi>ergo.</hi> See <hi>Rom,</hi> 4. 9, 10. See more <hi>Page</hi> 22. 1 <hi>Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. That Law or Covenant that is contra-distinguished or opposed to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Faith, or Gospel Covenant could not be one and the same in nature and quality with it.</p>
            <p>But the Apostle lays down the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of circumcision, as contra-distinct or opposed to Faith or the Covenant of Grace, <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. That Covenant or precept that could profit none unless they keep the whole Law perfectly, it could not appertain to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, but so 'tis said of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>10. That Law or Covenant that obliged those that conformed to it, to keep the whole Law, could not belong to the Covenant of Grace, but so did circumcision oblige, See <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. See our last <hi>Annotators</hi> on that Text.</p>
            <p>11. That Covenant that is called a Yoke of Bondage, could not be the Covenant of Grace. But circumcision is called a Yoke of Bondage, <hi>ergo.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

All those that are in the Covenant of Grace God promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to all the saving Blessings of the said Covenant, but all those that were in the Covenant of circumcision had not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to all the saving Blessings of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. All those that are in the Covenant of Grace God promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> have a sure and strong ground of consolation, that is, Spiritual Consolation; and they should be saved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 13, 14, 15. But many of them that were in the Covenant of circumcision had no sure ground of consolation, that is, Spiritual, nor have many of our Children who are Believers any such ground of consolation, but some of them may perish, <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, why did you not answer these arguments? you have said nothing, that is worth regard to me. Also shew if you writ again what profit your Infants receive by Baptism, and in what sense they are in the Covenant of Grace, and how they can be Members of your Churches, and yet are not Members nor received as such, until they actually believe and repent,—But remember if you could prove them in the Covenant of Grace, yet that doth not prove you ought to Baptise them: Baptism is of mere positive right: You must have authority from Christ to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise them, or you sin if you do it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 136. You tell us, <hi>That the form of circumcision was transient, and is ceased—Yet the Essential part thereof remaineth in the Flesh, for nothing could be more a Type of Baptism than Circumcision,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I promised to forbear hard words; but a Man that argues thus should be severely dealt with one way or another, <hi>i. e.</hi> either by writing, or rather in a Church way be severely reproved. Does the Essential part of circumcision remain in the Flesh, then the mark it made in the Flesh doth no doubt remain, for I know not what was else the essential part of it remaining in the Flesh save that, the form was the cutting off the fore-skin.</p>
            <p>If you had said the essential thing signified by it doth remain in the Heart of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, you had said some thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose—But.</p>
            <p>Did ever any Man before now inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that Baptism is the essential part of circumcision? If this were so, circumcision could not be circumcision in the Flesh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptism, because a thing cannot be where the essential part of it is wanting.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to give a reason why the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part of circumcision remains in the Flesh, <hi>Page</hi> 136. <hi>viz.</hi> how saith he, <hi>could</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>this token of the Covenant be everlasting, if the Essence thereof was dissolved upon the coming in of the Gospel? This cannot be, for it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in it self; for everlasting and dissolution are opposites.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> This Man by this argument gives cause to fear he may erelong plead for circumcision, and turn <hi>Jew,</hi> for he is for the essential part of it, and that in the Flesh too already: I am sorry he understands no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the difference between a Type and the Antitype, for there can no part of the Type remain (much less the essential part of it when the Antitype is come)—But he runs into this error from his ignorance of the word <hi>Everlasting;</hi> which as I have shewed is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be taken with restriction, and refers to a long period of time.—He may as well say <hi>Aarons</hi> Priesthood remains, or the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al part of it, because called an <hi>Everlasting Priesthood,</hi> Numb. 25. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59964:17"/>2. We deny Baptism was the Antytipe of circumcision: To prove it was not, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven many reasons, which he answers not.</p>
            <p>1. Both Circumcision and Baptism were in full force together for some time, even from the time <hi>John</hi> Baptized, until the Death of Christ.</p>
            <p>2. Because one thing that is a figure or shadow cannot come in the room of, as the Antitype of another thing that is a figure. See 12 Reasons more in <hi>Rector Rectifiea Page</hi> 4. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One of them Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> takes notice of, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Circumcision belonged only to Male Children, Baptism belongs to Males and Females who believe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To this he answers, <hi>that the Females was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Males, because Man is the head and representative of the Woman, and Woman is a part of Man.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Why then let your Females be Baptized in your Males: for from hence it will follow when your Males are Baptized, your Females are Baptized also, as much as the <hi>Jews</hi> Females were circumcised.</p>
            <p>Neither need your Wives eat the Lords Supper, for when you receive, they receive it. But sure, Sir, you mistake; your learning fails you: Will the food you eat feed your Wife? or will your Faith serve her? Doth she believe when you believe, because she is part of you, as here you intimate?</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 12. 7. he reflects on me for say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God may have many ways to save dying Infants, which we know not: He can apply the Benefits and Merits of Christ's Blood to them in ways we are wholly ignorant of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this I Quoted Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take his answer, <hi>viz. Pray take notice this Man contradicts himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for in <hi>page</hi> 21. (he saith) <hi>They must believe and repent, and bring forth good Fruits,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet here,</hi>

                  </gap>, you see there is</hi> (saith he) <hi>but one way to eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> I cannot see but that you have by your arguing, thus excluded all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that dye, out of the Kingdom of Heaven; for if no Infant can be saved, unless they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Repent, and bring forth good Fruits as the Adult must, if they are saved, how is it possible any Infant can be saved?</p>
            <p>2. I did not contradict my self, I spoke not there of Infants, but of Adult Persons: And why did you before only plead for habitual Faith to be in dying Infants, that go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, since row you here intimate that they must believe? For you cite <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believes and is Baptized, shall be saved, and he that believes not shall be damned.</hi> If our Saviour in these words refers to Infants, as well as to Men and Women, I am mistaken, and all Learned Men I ever met with.

Nor doth the Meritorious death of Christ, without the infusing divine Faith into the Soul, render any Man a Believer: Besides, tho' 'tis by the Grace and power of Christs Spirit, that we <hi>Believe, Repent,</hi> and bring <hi>forth good Fruit:</hi> Yet 'tis we that Believe, and Repent, the act is ours, tho' inabled by Divine Power. to do it. Now prove that God gives any Infant such power to Believe and Repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who know not the object of Faith, nor have any understanding. Friend, they are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, who say God may have many ways to apply the Blood and Merits of Christ, and so Save and Sanctifie dying Infants, which we know not of, than you who assert that not one of them can be saved unless they <hi>Believe, &amp;c.</hi> and if they do not do so, they shall be Damned: For you positively affirm there is no way of Gods saving Elect dying Infants, differing in any point from that of his saving Adult persons 'tis well you may Err, for should what you say be true, 'tis enough to bring sorrow and amazement upon Godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, about the State of their dying Infants.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Wherein <hi>Mr.</hi> Shutes arguments to prove our Churches no Churches, and our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism a counterfeit, are examined and answered.</head>
            <p>1. IN <hi>page</hi> 186. he asserts, <hi>That Adult belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>have nothing to do with the Ordinance after the first institution or Plantation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in a Family, unless it be such, whose Parents deprived them of it in their Infancy: But Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Right is devolved upon the Infant Seed of Believers.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> If this be true, then the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of unbelievers have no right to Baptism, neither as Infants nor when Adult believers, it the right be devolted upon the Infants of believers.—This in the first place is enough to convince him of his great error and mistake, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he will not say that unbelievers Children have any right thereto in their Infancy. Tho' his evidence that <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed, tho' ungodly persons, were required to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Children, and their Children had the same right to it; for were none but godly <hi>Jews</hi> to circumcise their Male infants? Pray observe this.</p>
            <p>2. Besides, did not God expresly command <hi>Abraham</hi> as well to circumcise his Male Infants as himself; and so his offspring their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after him in their generations? And now did our Saviour give such a Commission about Gospel Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> that first those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved should be Baptized, and then their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; or was there not the same purity of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for Christs Commission about Baptism to have run thus, as there was for Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission so to run to <hi>Abraham</hi> about circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If what you say was true but we will come to his reasons to prove our Baptism a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and our Churches no Churches of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In Page 186. <hi>first, because, saith he, they disown the Covenant God made with Abraham, in which the very foundation; for Baptism, was laid; let them find another foundation for it, if they can; for that Covenant is founded upon Christ himself,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> This in the first place is not that he charges us with, <hi>viz.</hi> that we disown <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> for the Covenant of Grace, God promised to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> contend for it as far forth as any can—But we do say the Covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision is disannuled; that we do disown to be in force now.</p>
            <p>2. Could he prove that Baptism is founded upon the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would seem to say some thing: But we deny that utterly; for had not Christ Instituted or given it forth in the New Testament, none could have known that Baptism had been an Ordinance; it was not Imprinted on the Hearts of Men, but it is a mere positive precept.</p>
            <p>3. I will shew you therefore another foundation for it, and not the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Jesus Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. If we have it not here, saith Mr. <hi>Richard Baxter,</hi> where have it we? But you are wiser it appears than that <hi>Pedo-Baptist.</hi> Now Friend, since our Baptism is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Christs Commission, both as to subject and mode of Baptising, our Baptism is no counterfeit, and so you will know one day.</p>
            <p>
               <q>2. Your second reason is, <hi>because we Baptise the Adult Seed of Believers, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in their Infancy, as they ought not.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> You do but beg the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. We 'tis true, do Baptise the Adult Seed of some Believers, but we deny they were Baptized in their Infancy, they were but Rantized; but had they been in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy Baptized, <hi>i, e.</hi> Dipped, yet not having the prerequisites of Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith and Repentance, they were not the true subjects of that Gospel ordinance. But Friend, do we do well to Baptise the off-spring of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, since by your argument they in their Infancy could not have true right to it, it being intayled on Believers Seed only? is that Branch of our Baptism a counterfeit also?</p>
            <p>3. <q>
                  <hi>You say their Baptism cannot be good, because they deny it to their own Seed and off-spring; when as the Covenant is made to Believers and their Seed: So that either they are no believers themselves, or else they Reprobate their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59964:18"/>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> Our Baptism may be good in your own opinion, I suppose, if our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were unbelievers—But Friend, whose authority renders any Ordinance good? If we act according to the authority of Christ in Baptism, is not our Baptism good? We deny Baptism to our Children, because all are required to believe, repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36, 37. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 12, 14, 39, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But do we reprobate our Children because we Baptise them not? is that in our power? or can Baptism bring into, or cast out of Gods election?</p>
            <p>3. Friend, we deny that the Covenant of Grace, God promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> gives any a right to Baptism. No, no, 'tis Christs positive command. If the Covenant of Grace gave <hi>Lot</hi> no right to circumcision, as it did not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not commanded of him, how can the Covenant of Grace give right to Baptism to any, person but to such only that Christ hath commanded to be Baptised?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>And lastly, you say their Baptism cannot be good, because their Principle is to Baptise Adult Believers, but not their Seed; which is to Baptise, but part of the believer; whereas they should Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, not only a part of him, but all of him: So that their Baptism is but a counterfeit Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Is this to shew your great wisdom? But are our Children a part of our selves and are we not believers without our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? How if our Children should prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, then I fear we shall not go for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat believers, but one part of us is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and the other part of us an unbeliever; also then if your Child should perish, but a part of you would be saved; is it fit such stuff should be Printed? Do not mistake your self, you are one compleat Man, and your Son another, and you are no less compleat a Man if you have no Child at all: So it you are a believer you are a compleat believer and want no part, and if your Child is an unbeliever: yet you are not less a compleat believer.</p>
            <p>But you that Sprinkle only the Face, I am sure you do not Baptise the whole person of a Child, nor any part of it, nor of the Adult neither: What shall I call your Baptism.—</p>
            <p>In Page 187. you quote our three Queries, but answer none of them.</p>
            <p>1. Whether Children are in the Covenant of Grace, absolutely or conditionally? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that can be an ordinance of Christ to which there is neither precept nor example? 3. Whether in matters of meer positive right, such as Baptism is, we ought not to keep ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly and punctually to the revealed will of the Lawgiver?</p>
            <p>Had you answered these three queris to the purpose, you had done, ten times more than what is contained in your whole Book.</p>
            <p>But instead of answering you ask this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <q>
                  <hi>viz. where do you find any command for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Seed of believers, to stay till they are Adult, to be Baptized?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> Where did God expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumcise his Male Infants, on the 7th or 9th day, or not to circumcise Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Infants?</p>
            <p>2. There needs no Negative Law where there is a Law in the affirmative; if on the 8th day, it follows not on the 7th or 9th; if Males only are expressed, not Females; so if believers, if such who are taught and made Disciples by teaching, are commanded to be Baptized, then all must stay till they do believe, and are taught and made Disciples, before Baptized.</p>
            <p>3. Was not the Gospel, think you, planted in <hi>Joseph and Mary's House,</hi> and yet the Holy Child Jesus stayed till he was about 30 years old, before Baptized. Also <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in his 4th Oration, saith Dr. <hi>Duveil,</hi> gives an instance of those who died without Baptism by reason of Infancy.</p>
            <p>And the same <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> saith he, tho' he was a Bishops Son, being a long time bred up under his Father, was not Baptized until he came to Mans age; and so <hi>Basil</hi> the Great, who was born of pious Parents, and instructed from his Childhood, was not Baptized until a Man.</p>
            <p>The like he says of <hi>Hiorem, Ambrose, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom, Augustin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nothing of this nature ought to be done in Gods worship, without authority from his wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; prove if you can, one Infant was Baptized from the beginning of <hi>Matthew,</hi> to the end of the Revelations of <hi>John.</hi>

                  <hi>The Baptized Churches, falsly called Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, are constituted according to the direct pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern laid down in the New Testament,</hi> ergo <hi>they are true Churches of Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these let me add the fourth, which Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> hath in his half Sheet.</p>
               <p>4. Arg. <hi>Those Churches who make Christs merits the foundation of their Salvation, and his Doctrin the foundation of their Churches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, are true Churches, and their Baptism is Authentick: But the Baptists do thus,</hi> ergo.</p>
               <p>5. Arg. <hi>If the ordinances of Christ are to be kept as they were first delivered to the Saints, and as practised by the Apostolical Church, our Baptism, which you call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> counterfeit, is Christ's true Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Ordinances of Christ are to be kept as they were first delivered to the Saints, and as they were practised by the Apostolical Church,</hi> ergo, <hi>our Baptism is Christs true Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Friend, how can you hold Communion with such persons who have a <hi>counterfeit Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism?</hi> for I hear you break Bread with some who own no other Water-Baptism but that of Believers only, and deny Infants to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof. I think none of our godly Brethren who are <hi>Pedo-Baptists,</hi> ever denied our Baptism, tho' they strive to justify theirs: which of them will call the Baptism of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, yea, tho' such who were Sprinkled when Babes, to be a counterfeit? Without repentance you must be accountable for this one day.</p>

            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 4. he says <hi>he will not render railing for railing.</hi> Yet in <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. you will find these expressions, speaking to Mr. <hi>Collins, you have charged me falsly You bogled and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 42. Because Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> saith, that the habit of Faith if it be in all Infants of believers, it cannot be lost; there being no losing the habits of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Shute,</hi> says <hi>this Gentleman</hi> (meaning Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>) doth as <hi>little Boyes,</hi> that make a thing of Rags <hi>in Imitation of a Cock, and when they have set it up throw at it.</hi> But gives no other Answer (as appears to me) than by denying that he asserted, all Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have habitual Faith; yet 'tis from that <hi>Topick</hi> he seems to plead for the Baptising of all believers Infants?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 46. he says, Mr. <hi>Collins is troubled with a grumbling in his gizzard.</hi> Are those come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressions.</p>
            <p>He says in <hi>Page</hi> 57. that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to mock at habitual Faith, because he compares <hi>Faith Potential</hi> and <hi>habitual:</hi> Faith in the Infants of believers, as such, with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>He renders me worse then the Devil. <q>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 116. The Devil left out part of a Scripture <hi>once to tempt our Saviour with; but in my weak Judgment, saith Mr.</hi> Shute, <hi>this Author had done it three times successively to maintain this error,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the better to beguile and deceive poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant bigotted Souls,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord knows I did not leave out part of the Text at any time, to avoid answering their objection, or to favour our cause: But quoted then what was to the purpose in Hand: And that objection I designed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer afterwards, as I did in the second part in order. As the <hi>Reader</hi> may see that hath the Book.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 82. he saith, speaking of Mr. <hi>Collins, was there ever such Legerdemain played with the Sacred Scripture?</hi> In <hi>Page</hi> 23. he speaking to Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> crys out, <hi>O for shame cease from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Carnal reason, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas 'tis he himself that infers false conclusions from Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> words, and then cries out, <hi>O for shame.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Yet the Text clearly intimates, <hi>Act</hi> 16. 34. that after they were Baptized, (he) that is, the Jaylor brought them into his House. Doth not that imply they went out of it? And it might be to a River, as far as he knows.</p>

               <p>Whereas we read that all <hi>his</hi> House believed as well as himself, and as soon too as we read of the Jaylors own Faith; so that he may as well say, the <hi>Jaylor</hi> did not believe himself, before he was Baptized, as so to affirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>his House.</hi> He says, <hi>Page</hi> 11. <hi>John Bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Answer,</hi> I fear he saw but part of my Book; for 'tis a great untruth which he affirms, <hi>viz.</hi> that I never named <hi>Everlasting Covenant;</hi> for I, as you have heard (in this Answer) did not only name it, but answered the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is raised from thence, See Part 2. <hi>Page</hi> 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Now that Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> hath left part of the words in some Texts, and added words in other he hath quoted, See <hi>Page</hi> 120. Where he mentions the words of that Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>For as in Adam a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So in <hi>Page</hi> 133. mentioning <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. viz. <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath wrote it thus, viz. <hi>He that believeth shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(Baptized) is left out to favour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, I fear; for tho' faith be the same in every age, yet the the Ordinances are not the same, under the Gospel, as under the Law, for <hi>Baptism</hi> is no legal Ordinance, nor the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Also he has given a false exposition on seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Verses, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and hath in so doing abused Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> also; these are Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> words (as repeated by Mr. <hi>Shute</hi>) Page 75, 76. <hi>The natural Branches are broken off,</hi> ergo <hi>Childrens visible incovenanting, is repealed; the Antecedent of this Enthymem is clear from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles assertion,</hi> Rom. 11. 19, 20, 21. <hi>by the natural Branches without controversie, is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the natural Seed of Abraham</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> leaves out Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> demonstration following, to prove his <q>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the branches saith he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controversy, is to be understood the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the breaking off, must either be meant, from visible Church-membership, and external privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereunto belonging; or the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant of grace: It cannot, saith he, be the latter, because that Covenant is immutable,</q> therefore it must be the former. Thus Mr. <hi>Collins:</hi> And he argues to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for 'tis impossible for any to be broken off from the Covenant of Grace, who were once in that; and 'tis as clear that the Jews or natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as such, are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, from being any more a visible Church, and that the legal Covenant, for their incovenanting, <hi>i. e.</hi> both Parents and Children, as such, is gone and taken away; <hi>he took away the first that he might establish the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Heb.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>a First,</hi> and <hi>a Second, an Old</hi> and <hi>a New.</hi> Now the first is only taken away, as a Covenant of works, <hi>do this and thou shall live;</hi> and as it was given to the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> by vertue of which they held their Church-State, and Church-membership, and all their external Rites, Ordinances, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, <hi>for the Priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change of the whole Law,</hi> Heb. 7. 12.</p>
               <p>Tho' it was for the Jews unbelief they were broken off, yet the dispensation being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was impossible for them to keep their Church-State and external Legal Rites, and Priviledges any longer; for 'tis evident that those Jews that believed in Christ, abode no longer members of their Old Church; but were transplanted into the Gospel Church; what can be more clear than this, <hi>viz. the Old House</hi> and <hi>Old legal Right</hi> of Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is overturned and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Man makes it his main business to prove that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is not taken away, which we assert with as much Zeal as he; but see how he abuses the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>viz. as those</hi> Jews <hi>which were these Branches were broken off, and their Children with them were cast out of the Covenant: So the Gentiles, and all their Children were taken into Covenant, in their room, and did partake of the same Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, with those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Is the Apostle speaking here of a Legal Federal Holiness? No, not a word of any such matter: But of such a Holiness as was in the Post, <hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi> who was Spiritually Holy, being an Elect Person; and to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness the Apostle refers. <hi>viz.</hi> first in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Gods Election, Personal, and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Gods intention.</p>
               <p>Now then to apply the Holiness and Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, to outward Dispensation only in the whole Church, which is meant of saving Grace in the invisible, and to make every believing Parent a like Root to his posterity with <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Seed, as some have done, and this Man seems to do; is a great abuse of the Sacred Text.</p>
               <p>For this would be to set up another wall of separation or partition betwixt (believers and their seed, and unbelievers and their Seed,) as the Old one wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, which is now broken down between Jews and Gentiles according to <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15. as also <hi>a knowing of Men after the Flesh, i. e.</hi> after fleshly Descent, external Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The first Fruit</hi> spoken of we understand to refer to <hi>Isaac, Jacob,</hi> and the Holy <hi>Partriachs,</hi> who were given to <hi>Abraham</hi> as the first Fruit of the Covenant of Grace God made with him, who were all Holy as <hi>Abraham,</hi> their <hi>Root</hi> was Holy, that is, Spiritually and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Holy.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>By the Lump</hi> may be meant the whole Body of the Elect or Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who lived from the time the first Fruit was given him until the Gospel Days, who were all Holy as the Root also.</p>
               <p>By Lump cannot be intended the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, as Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> positively affirms, in <hi>Page</hi> 82. for it so, what consistency can there be in the Apostles words and Argument? The Apostle speaks of the Elect <hi>Israel,</hi> not of the fleshly and Carnal <hi>Israel;</hi> take this Mans words <hi>the first Fruit the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Lump or whole Nation of them; and here is the same Root, on which the Gentiles are grassed, Page</hi> 82. He confounds the first Fruit and Lump together, and says by it is meant the whole Nation of the Jews. What Text can be wronged worse? We grant 'tis the same Root that all Gentile believers partake of the fatness of which the godly Jews pertook of under the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blessings of the Covenant of Grace made with the Root <hi>Abraham;</hi> but what is this to our Carnal Seed as such?</p>
               <p>4. <hi>By the Branches</hi> who are said to be Holy also, certainly is to be understood those Elect ones of <hi>Israel</hi> who were living in the Apostles Days, as <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>even so then at this time also there is a Remnant according to the Election of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now observe the Apostle speaks, in <hi>vers.</hi> 17. of some Branches that were broken off, and of the Gentiles who <hi>were like a Wild Olive Tree,</hi> being grassed in; these Branches that were broken off, were the unbelieving Jews, who at that time comprehended the whole


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59964:21"/>
national Church of <hi>Israel;</hi> for all that believed that were <hi>Jews,</hi> were transplanted into the Gospel Church, these Branches that were broken off sprang from the same Root as <hi>Abraham,</hi> was their Father according to the Flesh and Legal Covenant, and for a time seemed true Branches, they were of <hi>Israel,</hi> though not <hi>Israel, Rom.</hi> 9. 6. they were the Children of the Flesh, but not the Children of the promise, they were in the external Covenant, but being not in the Covenant of Grace, by Faith, and the Old Covenant being now gone and taken away, they were cut off and no more lookt upon as Branches in any sense.</p>
               <p>They were Branches in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Church, but there is a new <hi>will</hi> made, a <hi>new and last Testament confirmed, and ratifie by the Death of the Testatour Jesus Christ,</hi> and the fleshly Seed as such have no such <hi>legacy,</hi> left them as in the Old Testament, <hi>viz.</hi> to be Members of the New Testament Church, that running to none but to such who believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they not believing, or for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief were cut or broken off.</p>
               <p>1. Not broken off the Covenant of Grace, as Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> intimates, because they never were in that Covenant.</p>
               <p>2. Not broken off Gods Election, for to that they did not belong: But,</p>
               <p>3ly. They were broken off and their Children as such (or as so considered) so that they are no more a visible Church of God, nor a People in any Covenant relation to him.</p>
               <p>Yet we are not to conceive although those unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were in this Sense, broken off from their old standing and Church state that their Children who believed were rejected and lost, no, no; they that did believe in Christ and submit to the new dispensation, were by Faith grafted into Christ, and upon the profession of their Faith were united also to the Gospel Church and became members thereof.</p>
               <p>And so with the believing Gentiles did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fatness of the Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the Blessings and Priviledges of the Gospel Church, and doubtless this is the very truth of the matter according to the main Scope and design of the Holy Ghost, in this Chapter: Now then Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> greatly wrongs this place of Sacred Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. Whilst he argues that the <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off from the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>2. He wrongs the Text, whilst he says it was no dissolution of the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> but an excommunication of those unbelieving Persons out of it, by which he intimates as if the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> state still remains, and that the believing Gentiles are grafted into that old Legal Church that is removed and gone for ever.</p>
               <p>3. He wrongs this Text, whilst he would have all unbelievers Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> broken off the Covenant of Grace, for to that he seems to refer: For those of them that were in it were not broken off from that Covenant nor could be; and those of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Children, that believed, were in the like good Estate with believing Gentiles, and their believing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and many of the Children of the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews</hi> did no doubt own Jesus Christ, believe in him, and were implanted into the Gospel Church.</p>
               <p>4. Whilst he pleads for believing Getiles and their Infants, as such, to be taken into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and so made Members of the Church of Christ now, as the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> were Members of the Church, under the Law; for this he affirms <hi>Page</hi> 81, 82.</p>
               <p>5. Whilst he applies the Holiness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection here meant, to outward Dispensation, only in the visible Church, which is meant of saving Grace in the invisible.</p>
               <p>6. Whilst he makes every believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a like root to his posterity with <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Seed, he may as well say every believer is a common Father, to all that believe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was—For both these Conclusions I infer from his notion.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Reader,</hi> Pray observe, that the <hi>Jews</hi> that believed not, were broken off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more the People of God, in any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant relation to him, and this was for their unbelief, and their Church State being gone by the Dispensation of the Gospel, and by the bringing in the Gospel Church.</p>
               <p>2. That whosoever either <hi>Jews</hi> or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who are grafted into Christ the true <hi>Olive,</hi> and into the Gospel Church, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or be grafted in by Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> by their own Faith and own consent, not by the Faith of their Parent be made Members of the Church under the Gospel; no, but must believe themselves as well as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; 'tis not enough now to say we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, or that our Parents were believers and in Covenant, because the Church now does not consist of the


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59964:22"/>
carnal Seed, but of the true Spiritual Seed only.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> says in <hi>Page</hi> 82. to Mr. <hi>Collins, if you have not enough you shall have enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have done with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am satisfied and he too, he has said too much unless it were better or to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>He appeals to <hi>any experienced Christian a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, or of our party to judg whether there can be a more full Text of Scripture produced, to prove the continuation and Stability of the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If he will take my thoughts (who am 'tis like in his opinion as well as my own an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Christian) I must tell him he hath mistaken his <hi>Antagonist</hi> and the Text too: Cannot the <hi>Jewish</hi> Legal Church State go, but the Covenant of Grace must go, with them? <hi>God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle it is evident in this Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. speaks of Gods Election, which ran first to <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed, according to the Covenant of Grace, that is, to the Elect among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so argues <hi>God had not cast away his People whom he foreknew;</hi> and from hence he shews that all that belong to the said Election of Grace shall be called, and in the Latter days be brought in, or grafted into their own true Olive tree, <hi>i. e.</hi> into Christ and into the Gospel Covenant and Church, for all (the true) <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved, as it is written, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis said they are Holy that is they are decretively and in Gods sight and intention Holy: I wonder at some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors who conclude, that it is an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal relative Federal Holiness the Apostle speaks of here, which Holiness is not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in all the New Testament, as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Writer observes.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to what Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> says, to that Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Else were your Children unclean, but now are they Holy:</hi> Which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he mistakes also whilst he asserts it is Federal Holiness, as well as Matrimonial Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, for no doubt the Sanctification of the unbelieving Husband to the believing Wife, is the same Sanctification or Holiness that is said to be in the Children, that is, the Husband and Wife were Sanctified, or set apart for the use of one another, by Gods ordinance of Marriage, and so their Children were Holy, <hi>i. e.</hi> Legitimate, lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and not Bastards; for no doubt their Children that were born when both were unbelievers, were Holy in the Sense the Apostle speaks of, as such that were born when one was a believer: But see a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Text in <hi>Rector Rectified,</hi> from <hi>Page</hi> 113. to <hi>Page</hi> 120.</p>
               <p>And when he writes again let him answer what is there said Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> also gives a false exposition of that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Page</hi> 15, 16. Whilst he refers there to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of suffering, telling us the Apostle was there exerciting the Saints, to prepare for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; which is not true.</p>
               <p>Likewise he abuses that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>But God hath chosen the weak things of the World,</hi> &amp;c. by intimating as if the Apostle means little Children, <hi>and who are weaker</hi> (saith he) <hi>than Children?</hi> Page 23.</p>
               <p>Also that in <hi>Psa.</hi> 82. I think he would have to refer to Infants, <hi>i. e. out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings thou hast perfected thy praise,</hi> Page 23.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 130. that in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. he applies to Infants, viz. <hi>he that believes and is Baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be damned.</hi> And so pleads for like necessity, for infants to believe if saved, as the Adult.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 10. he seems to infer that <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> Baptized little Infants, because 'tis said, <hi>there went out to meet him all Judea and Jerusalem, and all the regions round about Jordan, and were Baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which I have answered, <hi>Ax laid to the Root;</hi> in my reply to Mr. <hi>Exell,</hi> see 2 Part <hi>Page</hi> 35. to 54.</p>
               <p>In Page 174. Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> citing <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>if it be by Grace then it is no more of Works;</hi> he infers if dying Infants are saved without Faith then they must be saved by works.</p>
               <p>Which is an abuse of that Text; for as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks not of Infants, so he speaks of Gods Grace and Favour, in opposition to works o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> merits, according to that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>by Grace you are saved;</hi> he puts Faith in the place of Grace: We say no Infant can be saved but by Grace; yet we do say we see not how it can be said that Infants do or can believe.</p>
               <p>And now let me infer from his notion, <hi>viz.</hi> if Infants cannot believe, they must all perish and be damned, this follows clearly from what he asserts: He had need to see he is certain of what he affirms.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 92. (he says,) <hi>it is common for Men of our opinion to bring in, and set up our own Carnal Reason, in opposition to the Wisdom of God;</hi> is not this an Unchristian charge? Besides, he proves not what he says, nor attempts to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59964:22"/>Sure some gracious Person or Persons he is concerned more particularly with in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowship, will look upon themselves bound in duty to inquire into some of these grand enormities, false acusations, and other evils this Man is found guilty of in his Writings.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 13. he says, <hi>that part of the Man, Woman, or Child, that is Baptized, must be naked; and if the whole Body must be Baptized, then the whole Body must be all naked also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he quotes a passage of Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> as if Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> could, or did Baptise <hi>Women naked,</hi> to render such a practice odious as indeed it would be, should any do it; but to cast that on us, is Unchristianly done. In <hi>Page</hi> 19. he intimates as if we had found <hi>two ways to Salvation,</hi> because we know not that dying Infants have Faith, or can believe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 20. he abuses Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> as if he was ignorant of any such thing as habitual Faith, because he knows nothing of such habits in Infants, and says <hi>he derides habitual Faith,</hi> which is a notorious falsehood, and that which Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> abhors to do.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 20. he would have his Reader think that Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> had rendred Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> an Anabaptist, because he quoted him to detect his notion of habitual Faith in Infants</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 43. because Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> said unless Children have personal actual Faith, they are not to meddle with Gods most holy things, Mr. <hi>Shute says, by this mans opinion Elect dying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants must be lost and damned;</hi> he would have those Children to be Infants that <hi>cryed Hosanna to the Son of David:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if it be not that he means it is nothing to his purpose; for we deny not, but some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children have and may have a work of God upon their Hearts, tho' not above five or six years old.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 68. he infers four false Conclusions upon Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> denying Faith to be in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That God cannot work Faith in young In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, because they are not able to help him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Doth Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> question Gods power, or intimate God cannot work, without help of the Creature?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That he doth tacitly declare that God is not able to make them capable of the Reception of Grace.</hi> Because they are not of years to <hi>exercise i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which are all false Conclusions and great abuses cast on Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and no ways to be inferred from his positions.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 73. he renders the Baptists to be cunning deceivers, take his words, <hi>i. e. I am not, saith he, all together ignorant of their devices, and stratagems by which they uphold their opinion, in which their Principles are enveloped and lie Dormant.</hi>

                  <hi>Answer,</hi> This is a false charge likewise, and no such consequence can be gathered from my words, to which he refers, as my Answer shews in this reply.</p>

               <p>2. How he hath proved that Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham, and his Carnal Seed as such, doth</hi> remain, let the <hi>Reader</hi> now Judg.</p>
               <p>3 How came (if this be so) <hi>Abraham</hi>'s na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed to be <hi>unchurched</hi> as he himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses in, <hi>Page</hi> 37. nay that they unchurched themselves.

               <p>IN the last place take a few of his Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Page</hi> 49. <hi>If you can prove, saith he, by plain Scripture Testimony that ever Christ or any of his Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did forbid the Baptising the infant Seed of Believers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> Now how impertinent is this? Where did Christ forbid Infants of Believers, the <hi>Lords Supper?</hi> and indeed they may have that as well as Baptism, and the first <hi>Fathers</hi> that established Infant Baptism, gave them the Lords Supper also:</p>
               <p>2. Where is <hi>crossing in Baptism</hi> forbid, or <hi>Popists Salt Spittle,</hi> or <hi>Crisom</hi> or other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish rites? These in plain words are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, are they therefore lawful? If Christ would have them to be Baptized, it would have been expressed in the affirmative; and is this horribly to impose our own uncouth notions as you affirm in the said 49. <hi>Page</hi> of your Book?</p>
               <p>Where hath Christ forbid Baptizing of <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Insidels,</hi> or the Children of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers?</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 98. he says the Church of the Jews was not a legal Church, take his words, <hi>viz. the Church of God under the Mosaick Law was not a Carnal legal Church.</hi> Strange contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction! What, a Church under the Law and not a legal Church? he may as well say the Church of God under the Gospel, is not a Gospel Church.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 97. he distinguishes not on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but positively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts that off from that Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> The Covenant of Grace, some of the natural Branches were broken; yet in contradiction to this he shews, in <hi>Page</hi> 74. from <hi>Psa.</hi> 89. That the Covenant of Grace is firm and abideth for ever, and else where shews that there's no final falling from grace; all those therefore say I, that are in that Covenant cannot fail of Salvation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those Branches never were in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 25. he says, <hi>God saves Elect dying Infants in no ways or means differing in any one point or part from that wherein he saves Adult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> Yet in <hi>Page</hi> 65. he owns <hi>Infants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exercise grace in an ordinary way, and that nothing is required of them personally but passive Obedience.</hi> Is nothing required say I, of Adult believers but passive Obedience? If there is then the way or mode of Gods saving dying Infants differs in some part or point from the way or means of saving the Adult; and clear it is that more than passive obedience is required of Adult persons.</p>
               <p>One while he says all <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed are in the Covenant of Grace God made with him, and he denies final falling out of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet in <hi>Page</hi> 12. he says, <hi>one of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams Sons or Seed is praying to him in Hell: And to be Abrahams Seed will not serve their turn.</hi>

               <p>He is for a Congregational Church, and yet in <hi>Page</hi> 34.

               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59964:23"/>Can a natural Church consisting of whole Parishes, Families, and Provinces, be all one with Gospel Congregational Churches of believers only?</p>
               <p>Why did this Man leave the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> also then the <hi>Jewish Church</hi>-state by his opinion continues still: He may say the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church is the same now as then; but not the visible, the matter, as well as the form is changed,—<hi>Ye also as living Stones are built up a Spiritual House,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 167. he inquires <hi>whether a Farmer destroys his Barn or hurts the Floor, when he takes a great keap of Corn and Chaff and Winnows the Corn, and Fans away the Chaff,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> I ask whether or no Christ did not remove by the Gospel Dispensation, all the Wheat out of the old Barn, nay, and pull down that Barn, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> and Fan quit away the <hi>Carnal Seed as such,</hi> and all the <hi>Chaff:</hi> And erect a new <hi>Garner</hi> or Gospel Church, into which he put his Wheat, <hi>i. e.

               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 136. he intimates <hi>that the essential part of circumcision is Baptism, and that the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part thereof remaineth in the Flesh still.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 130. he intimates, because I deny Infants to have right to Baptism (or that they can believe) that I assert <hi>two ways to be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He also there says, viz. <hi>there is no saving any Person old or young without the Grace of Faith; he</hi> Cites <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Thus you see, saith he, there is but one way to Eternal Life, either for old or young, that is, through Faith in the righteousness and merits of Christ.</hi> Wo be to poor Infants then say I, if they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as the Adult do; if it be thus, we say theres no way to be saved, but by Christ's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and righteousness imputed, and that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants must be sanctified that are saved also; but yet we dare not say they do or can be said, to believe as the Adult, and if they do not they must be damned according to his notion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is true of all the Adult that believe not.</p>
               <p>One while he seems to say that the Infants of believers as such, have habitual Faith.</p>
               <p>At another time confesses he cannot prove, that this or that Infant of believers hath Faith, or the habit of it, without he had a new Bible, <hi>Page</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>Doubtless the Tree is known by the Fruit if we speak of the Adult, we may know who do believe; (though I deny not but we may be mistaken in some;) how did <hi>Paul</hi> know that the Saints at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> were Elected, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 4, 5. <hi>Knowing, beloved, your Election of God.</hi> He shews how he came to know they had true Faith, and were Elected, <hi>for our Gospel came not to you in Word only, but in power,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>SInce I wrote this reply to Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> last Book, I have met with a single Sheet, which he calls <hi>an Answer to Mr.</hi> Hercules Collins <hi>last Shift,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which discovers more of his bitter Spirit, and what ill Influences he is under,—I thought it not amiss to make some remarks upon this Sheet, tho' I suppose Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> will think himself concerned to vindicate his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, from his undue, Unchristian, and false charges: This Paper of Mr. <hi>Shutes</hi> manifesteth very great confidence touching his notions of the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as much ignorance: As will quickly appear to all discerning Men who shall read it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 1st he says, <hi>I have cleared and vindicated the aforesaid Antidote from that foul Aspersion, and totally confuted all the Aspersors in my last Book, in the Judgment of all wise Judicious and Impartial Persons that have read it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> Let those wise persons he speak of, first read this precedent answer to his Book and then let them impartially Judg of it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 2. he speaks of Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> his five Arguments to prove the Covenant of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59964:24"/>To this Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> says, <q>
                  <hi>pray where do you find this distinction concerning the everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with Abraham, and his Seed?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> You shall see Friend that there is such a distinction found in the Scripture, and that your reverend Ministers confirm the same thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That God made a Covenant with <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed as such, which is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and also a Covenant with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed as such, which runs to Christ, and all that are his elect ones (See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Now to Abraham) and his Seed were the promises made. He saith not, and to Seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to thy Seed, which is Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Compared with <hi>verse</hi> 29. <hi>and if ye be Christs, then are ye Abrahams Seed, and heirs according to the promise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Friend, if you say this promise which the Apostle speaks of, (which is the everlasting Covenant of Grace, God made with <hi>Abraham</hi>) was made with many, <hi>i. e.</hi> both with <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural and Spiritual Seed as such, you contradict the Holy Ghost. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>And not to Seeds as of many,</hi> But you say to Seeds, <hi>i. e.</hi> all his natural and Spiritual Seed, <hi>Page</hi> 5. See also <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They are not all Israel, which are of Israel: Neither because they are the Seed of Abraham, are they all Children: But in Isaac shall thy Seed be called. That is, they which are the Children of the Flesh, these are not the Children of God: But the Children of the promise</hi> (Mark it) <hi>are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the Seed.</hi> Is not that distinction Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> speaks of, clearly laid down in these Scripture? doth not the Apostle exclude the Carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as such; from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing included in the Covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>2. I need not go about to prove, there was a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his natural Seed as such, since that is so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully spoken of in the Scripture; <hi>viz. That the whole House of Israel both Parents and Children,</hi> were taken into the legal Covenant and all were Members of the <hi>Jewish Church;</hi> read <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10, 12, <hi>Dent.</hi> 29. 9, 10, 11. 12, 13. But that legal Covenant we affirm is abrogated and taken away: If it were not so, what is it which our Apostle speaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>He took away the first, that he might esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Second.</hi> Compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 13.</p>
            <p>Sure none can once Immagin that this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was the Covenant of Grace: Also what doth the Apostle mean when he says, <hi>cast out the Bond Woman and her Son, Gal.</hi> 4. 30. Doth he not tell us by the <hi>Bondwoman</hi> is meant the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> given to the <hi>whole House of Israel,</hi> or the lineal Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> not the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant given to all Mankind in the <hi>first Adam;</hi> and doth he not tell us by the <hi>Son of the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> is meant the <hi>fleshly Seed of Abraham as such?</hi> Who were all taken into Covenant with God under the Old Testament: And yet is there no Covenant that peculiarly was made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed, as such.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 7. Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> repeats. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>And I will establish my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God to thee and to thy Seed after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he leaves out the following verse, wherein the Covenant is Mentioned (which he charges as an high crime in others) <hi>viz. this is my Covenant, which ye shall keep between me, and you, and thy Seed after thee; every Man-Child among you shall be circumcised.</hi> Verse 10. <hi>and ye shall circumcise the Flesh of your Fore-skin, and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you,</hi> verse 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that is born in thy House, and he that is bought with thy Mony, must needs be circumcised: And my Covenant shall be in your flesh; for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant,</hi> verse 13. these Verses he Cites not.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> Judges this Covenant is the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that for two reasons (as I suppose.)</p>
            <p>1. Because 'tis called an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>2. Because God promised in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the God of his Seed after him in their Generations, which no doubt refers to his natural Seed as such. Taking in both those of his off-spring that did believe in Christ to come, and such also that did not so believe that proceeded from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Loins by <hi>Isaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to the Term <hi>everlasting,</hi> I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the precedent, Answer, that some times in the Scripture it is taken with restriction, and denotes only a long period of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> during that Dispensation, or until the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Indeed this Covenant could continue no longer than the Token of it abode or was to abide in their Flesh: Read the words again <hi>verse</hi> 13. <hi>and my Covenant shall be in your Flesh for an everlasting Covenant.</hi>

            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> I would know whether God is now in Covenant with <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed as such; or are they not rejected? how then could this be the unchangeable Covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>Read my 14. Arguments in the precedent Answer, to prove the Covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was not the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>2. Was God the God of all <hi>Abrahams</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Seed as such; by way of special interest? if so, they shall no doubt be all Eternally sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as well as all the Children or Carnal Seed of Believers: Which you will not admit of.</p>
            <p>Therefore consider that God may be said to be the God of a People, two manner of ways.</p>
            <p>1. By the free promise or Covenant of Grace, in a Spiritual Sense: Or by Divine Union with him, through faith and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Holy Spirit; 'tis this gives special interest in God to all Adult Persons, and thus he was not the God of all <hi>Abrahams</hi> Carnal Seed, no, but of a few of them only comparatively, for tho' the number of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> be as the Sands of the Sea, yet but a Remnant shall be saved.</p>
            <p>2. God may be said to be the God of a People, by entring into an external, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or legal Covenant with them; and thus he was the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of all his Carnal Seed or Off-spring, or whole House of <hi>Israel:</hi> Under the Old Covenant, or Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Law: God made them as a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a peculiar People unto himself, and was said to be married to them.</p>
            <p>See Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> one of your own Ministers in his Sermon preached at Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. He shews that God is the God of all Mankind by Creation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>2. God is the God of a People, upon the account of external calling and profession; and thus, saith he, the posterity of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Friend, This I desire you to weigh well, for God was not by way of special interest, in a Spiritual Sense the God of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Seed as such: Therefore it was this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenent, no doubt that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends when he says the Ministry of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> did burn as an <hi>Oven,</hi> and left the Jews neither the Root of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, nor the Branches of their own good works, <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> those notions of yours into you, about the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> I am satisfied you abuse your Ministers; I am sure Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> taught you no such Doctrin, as I have already shewed; and I shall here again faithfully cite two or three passages more of that Reverend Minister of Christ: See his Exposition on the 8th Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews, Page</hi> 219, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He shews that the Covenant God made with the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> was not that Ministration of the Covenant of Works God made with all Men in the first <hi>Alam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That it was not the Covenant of Grace:</p>
            <p>1. Saith he, <hi>Page</hi> 224. <q>the Old Covenant, the Original Covenant of works made with <hi>Alam</hi> and all Mankind in him is not intended, for this is undoubtedly a Covenant different in the Essence and Substance of it from the New. In <hi>Page</hi> 219. He saith, but it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Covenant intended, was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant wherein the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> walked with God, until such time as this better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was solemnly introduced, this is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in the ensuing context, he says, <hi>it was bec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>me old</hi> and ready to disappear. Wherefore it is not the Covenant of works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> that is intended when this other is said, to be a better Covenant: <hi>Thus the Doctor.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59964:25"/>Friend doth not he hereby clearly lay down a Covenant of peculiarity made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> natural Seed as such, or a Covenant that only and peculiarly belonged to them; and 'tis as plain this began in that Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In <hi>Page</hi> 288. he saith, we must grant two distinct Covenants to be intended rather than a twofold Administration of the same Covenant meerly to be intended.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He also shews that the old Covenant which God made with the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> could not be the Covenant of Grace, because there was no reconciliation with God, nor Salvation to be obtained by vertue of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>Observe the <hi>Doctor</hi> speaks not of <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant, but of that Covenant God gave to the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> or natural Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He further shews that the Covenant of Grace, untill Christ came, was only contained in promise, by which Covenant, all that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved under the Old Testament who had Faith in it were saved, <hi>to Abraham and his Seed was the promise made, Gal.</hi> 3. 16. That was the Covenant of Grace, therefore say we, the <hi>Covenant of circumcision,</hi> and <hi>Sinai Covenant</hi> where there was mutual stipulation betwixt God and the whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> could not be the Covenant of Grace; besides, 'tis said that <hi>that Covenant they broke, and</hi> by so doing, lost all the external blessings of it, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zach.</hi> Chap. 11. 10, 14. shws, because of the Jews unbelief, and putting the <hi>Messiah</hi> to Death, God broke his Covenant with that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Zech. 11. 10. <hi>And I took my Staff, even beauty, and cut it asunder: That I might break my Covenant which I made with all the People.</hi> What is become now of your everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, God made with all the People of <hi>Israel</hi> or natural Seed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Is it not gone, are his Carnal Seed as such still in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, or are they not with their external legal Covenant cast out? Sir the everlasting Covenant of Grace, that stands firm 'tis true, that is confirmed by the Oath of God, and Blood of Christ; but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in which was contained circumcision, and all the Legal Rites and Jewish Church, and Church-membership is gone and taken away.</p>
            <p>The <hi>New Covenant is not according to that Old Covenant</hi> God made with the whole House of <hi>Israel</hi> or Carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> if it be not according to it, then it was not the same in Essence, nature or quality: See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. This, saith the <hi>Doctor,</hi> is the nature and substance of that Covenant, which God made with that People (<hi>viz.</hi>) a peculiar temporary Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Page</hi> 235. Mark it Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He adds and concurs with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who deny that by the two Covenants is meant only a twofold Administration of the same Covenant, but that two Covenants, substantially distinct are intended.</q>
            </p>
            <p>`1. Because in the Scripture they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so called, and compared with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and some times opposed to one another; the first and the last, the new and the old.</p>
            <p>
               <q>2. Because the Covenant of Grace in Christ is eternal, immutable, always the same, obnoxious unto no alteration, no change or abrogation, neither can these things be spoken of it with respect unto any Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of it, as they are spoken of the Old: <hi>Page</hi> 226, 227.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>1. He shews again that by the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is not intended the Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam Page</hi> 227.</q> When,</p>
            <p>
               <q>2. We speak of the New Covenant, saith he, we do not intend the Covenant of Grace absolutely, as though that were not in being and efficacy before the Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which is promised in this place: For it was always the same as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it. From the beginning it passed through the whole Dispensation of times, before the Law and under the Law, of the same nature and Efficacy unalterable ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, <hi>ordered in all things and sure.</hi>—Again he saith, when God renewed the promise of it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is said to make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, and he did so, but it was with respect unto other things (Mark it) especially the proceedings of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Seed from his Loins; but absolutely under the Old Testament it consisted only in a promise: And as such only is proposed in the Scripture.</q> 
               <hi>Page</hi> 227. it appears that the Doctor understands the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we do <hi>viz.</hi> the promise to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ and all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal blessings with him, to intend the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; but whereas it is said God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> that has respect to other things, that which concerned


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59964:26"/>
his natural Seed and out of whose Loins Christ was to come, <hi>That's the Covenant of peculiarity;</hi> he proceeds and gives three reasons why the Covenant of Grace could not absolutely in it self, but in the promise of it only be called a formal) Covenant: <hi>Page</hi> 227.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. Because it wanted its solemn confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and establishment by the Blood of the only Sacrifice, which belonged unto it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was done in the Death of Christ, it had not the formal nature of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>2. This was wanting, (saith he) it was not the Spring, rule and measure of all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Church <hi>i e.</hi> this doth belong unto every Covenant, properly so called, that God makes with the Church; that is the intire rule of all the worship that God requires of it, which is that they are to restipluate in their entrance into Covenant with God; but so the Covenant of Grace was not under the Old Testament, for God did require of the Church many duties of worship, that did not belong thereunto; but now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament this Covenant, with its own Seals and appointments is the only rule and measure of all acceptable worship, wherefore the new Covenant promised in the Scripture and here opposed unto the old, is not the promise of Grace, Mercy, and Life, and Salvation by Christ, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely considered, but as it had the formal nature of a Covenant given unto it in its establishment by the Death of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Page</hi> 227.</p>
            <p>1. Now pray observe, does not the Doctor clearly hint thereby, that no Rite, Sign, or Seal properly of the Old Testament can be a Rite Sign or Seal properly of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, how then could circumcision be the Seal of the said Covenant of Grace?</p>
            <p>2. It is evident in the Covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, there was a restipulation at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that Covenant with God, so that that was a formal Covenant, but the Covenant of Grace, he tells us was no formal Covenant; but only a <hi>free promise</hi> under the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Therefore there was two Covenants held forth in Gods Transactions with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First a formal Covenant made with him and all his Fleshly Seed, of which circumcision was a Sign at their entrance into it, which they thereby subscribed unto.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Covenant of Grace held forth only in Gods free promise to him.</p>
            <p>3. Whilst the Church enjoyed all the <q>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefits of the promise (faith he) wherein the substance of the Covenant of Grace was contained, before it was confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made the sole Rule of Worship, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, it was not inconsistent with the Holiness and Wisdom of God, to bring any other Covenant (Mark it) or prescribe unto it forms of Worship he pleased: <hi>Page</hi> 228.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then he proceeds further.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. That this Covenant did not (saith he) disannul or make in effectual <hi>the promise,</hi> but that it doth still continue the only means of Life and Salvation, and that this was so our Apostle proves at large, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 189.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. That this other Covenant with all the <q>worship contained in it, or required, by it, did but direct and lead unto the future establishment of the promise, in the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>By these words and in other places he shews, that, that Covenant God made with <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural Seed or whole House of <hi>Israel,</hi> tho' it was not the Covenant of Grace: Yet it was given in subserviency unto the Gospel Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>
               <q>3. These things being observed, (saith he,) we may consider that the Scripture doth plainly and expresly make mention of two Testaments, or Covenants, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes between them in such a way, as what is spoken cannot hereby be accommodated unto a twofold Administration of the same Covenant; The one is mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Deut</hi> 5. namely the Covenant God made with the People of <hi>Israel, &amp;c.</hi> The other promised <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. Cap. 32. 40. Which is the new Gospel Covenant as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained: And these two Covenants or Testaments are compared with the other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24, 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17, 18.</q> 
               <hi>Page</hi> 228.</p>
            <p>These things being, so it follows that the Doctor utterly overthrows, what Mr. <hi>John Flavel</hi> and other <hi>Pedo Baptists</hi> assert about the Covenant made with the People of <hi>Israel</hi> at <hi>Sinai,</hi> to which circumcision appertained, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was only Administration of the Covenant of Grace, and not a distinct Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59964:26"/>1. The <hi>Doctor</hi> then proceeds in <hi>Page</hi> 229. to prove that the Covenant made with <hi>Israel</hi> according to the Flesh, did not abrogate the Covenant of Works God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and substitute that in the room of it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>2. But that it revived, declared, and expressed all the Commands of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> that being nothing but a Divine Summary of the Law written in the Heart.</q>—Says he.</p>
            <p>
               <q>3. It revived the Sanction of the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the curse or sentence of Death which it denounced against all transgressors, Death was the penalty of the transgression of the Covenant of works.</q>
            </p>
            <p>`So say I, was Death, the penalty of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the Covenant of circumcision; <hi>the Male-Child the Flesh of whose Fore-skin is not cut off, shall dye the Death;</hi> which clearly shews it was of the same nature of the <hi>Sinai</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>
               <q>4. It revived the promise, saith he, of that Covenant of Eternal Life, upon perfect obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So say I, did the Covenant of circumcision, in that he that was circumcised was bound to keep the whole Law <hi>Gal</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now, saith the Doctor, this is no other but the Covenant of Works revieved; nor had this Covenant of <hi>Sinai</hi> any such promise of Eternal Life annexed to it as such, but only the promise inseparable from the Covenant of works which is revieved, saying, <hi>do this and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hence, saith he, when our Apostle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth against justification by the Law, or by the Works of the Law, he doth not intend the Works <hi>peculiar,</hi> unto the Covenant of <hi>Sinai;</hi> such as were the Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Worship then instituted, but he intends also the Works of the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let this be well considered, for 'tis from hence <hi>Paul</hi> excludes circumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. As being a work or duty opposed to Faith, and so appertaining to the Old Covenant.</p>
            <p>He then proceeds in sixteen particulars to prove that the two Covenants differ from each other, <hi>Page</hi> 236, 237, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That they differ in circumstance.</p>
            <p>2. That they differ in the circumstance of place, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>3. That they differ in the manner of their promulgation,</p>
            <p>4. In their Mediators.</p>
            <p>
               <q>5. That they differ in their subject matter, both as unto the Precepts and Promises, all sin forbid upon pain of Death, and gave Promise of Life upon perfect Obedience, no promise of Grace to Communicate Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual strength to assist in Obedience.</q> Had,</p>
            <p>
               <q>Promises of temporal things in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in the New Covenant, saith he, all things otherwise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>6. That they differ in the manner of their Dedication and Sanction, that they differ in their substance and end, the old Covenant was Typical, Shadowy &amp; removable, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That they differ in their extent of their Administration, the first was confined unto the posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> excluding all others from the participation of the benefits of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Administration of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is extended unto all Nations under Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That they differ in their Efficacy, the Old made nothing perfect, the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant saith he,</q> became a special Covenant unto that People, that People were the posterity of <hi>Abraham, Page</hi> 232.</p>
            <p>Sir, What think you now of two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and of a Covenant of peculiarity with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Carnal Seed? You must consult your Ministers better before you write again. I doubt not but your <hi>Pastor</hi> is of Dr. <hi>Owens</hi> Judgment in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In <hi>Page</hi> 5. you say, <hi>In my last Book I have clearly made out, that whatsoever the Covenant God made with Abraham, was to himself and Seed both Spiritual and Carnal that were in the Covenant, is the same now to believers and all their Seed,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> Then it follows, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Carnal Seed who were ungodly Persons, were in the Covenant of Grace; for circumcision belonged to them and their Male Children as far forth as it did appertain, to believers and their Male Children who were of his race.</p>
            <p>2. It will follow then also, that we Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that believe, and our natural Off-spring have the same Right to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all other Priviledges of the Jewish Church with <hi>Abrahams</hi> Carnal Seed. There is no ways to save your self from the greatest absurdities imaginable, without distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between those two Covenants and the two Seeds, or between the Covenant of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision made with <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59964:27"/>
of the Covenant of Grace made to him, and to all his Spiritual Seed as such.</p>
            <p>3ly That Christ should come out of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Loins according to the Flesh, and of none else was in that Covenant God made with him, and a special part it was, of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of circumcision, and was that made to the Gentiles that believe, or was it not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed only according to the Flesh.</p>
            <p>4. Also when the Apostle speaks of the Gospel which God preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or promise of the Covenant of Grace; he doth not mention the Covenant of restipulation in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. But that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. Chap. 18. 18. and Chap. 22. 8.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer,</hi> Is not the Jewish Church State dissolved, and doth not Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> tell you their Old Covenant is gone? Yet,</p>
            <p>2. Do we say, the promise of the New Covenant God made to <hi>Abraham</hi> is dissolved? God forbid, for that is unalterable, and by the Vertue of which it is that believing Gentiles partake of the Blessings of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Friend, the Gentiles receive not the Blessings of <hi>Abraham through the Law,</hi> nor through <hi>the Covenant of Circumcision,</hi> but by Faith in the Promise of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. <hi>in thy Seed shall all the Families of the Earth be Blessed.</hi> Nay <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, 'tis evident, received not that blessedness in the Covenant of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>That Faith was reckoned to Abraham for Righteousness,</hi> The Apostle asserts <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>How was it then reckoned? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, but in uncircumcision.</hi> Verse 10. There was no need of this distinction, if circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion appertained to the Covenant of Grace; we see how 'tis contra-distinguished to the Covenant of Faith:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he received circumcision, a Seal of the righteousness of the Faith he had, yet being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised: That he might be the Father of all that Believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I argue that circumcision was a Seal to none but <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Because it is said to be a Seal of the righteousness of the Faith, <hi>Abraham</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet uncircumcised for so it could not be a Seal to others, because they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised before they believed.</p>
            <p>2. Because also it was to assure him of that peculiar Blessing and priviledge of being the Father of all that believe.—And none had that prerogative but <hi>Abraham</hi> only.</p>
            <p>3. Take this Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If Abraham received the Spiritual Blessing,</hi> viz. <hi>Righteousness and Justification by Faith in the promise of the Covenant of Grace made to him, and received not the Blessing of Righteousness and Justification in the Covenant of circumcision; then there were two Covenants contained in those Covenant, transactions of God with Abraham. But the former, and latter is true.</hi> Ergo <hi>there were two Covenants contained</hi> in those Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant transactions God made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In <hi>Page 3. Mr. Shute says, the Olive Tree or Covenant God made with Abraham, was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved: For the Jews are to be grafted into their own Olive Tree again; but if the Covenant were dissolved and repealed, how can they be taken into it again;</hi>

            <p>1. <hi>Answer</hi> This Man mistakes the Holy Ghost: The Apostle speaks not of the Jews, as being <hi>Abrahams</hi> Carnal Seed as such, but of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>2. Now who doubts but that the Covenant of Grace was their Covenant, or <hi>Olive Tree,</hi> even all of them that shall be taken into it of the Jewish race, in the latter days, as much as it was their Covenant, who were Jews and Elect ones who lived in the Apostles time.</p>
            <p>3. It might be called their <hi>Olive Tree</hi> or Covenant, because the Covenant of Grace as it was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> ran first to his natural Seed who were the Children of the promise, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Elect of God; hence Christ said he was <hi>not sent but to the lost Sheep of the House of Israel:</hi> That is, not first sent, they were first to have the offer of all New Covenant Grace and Blessings; to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained <hi>the Covenant and Adoption,</hi> &amp;c. viz. <hi>in the first place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Do we plead for the dissolution of the Covenant of Grace, God made with or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> because we say the Legal

and external Covenant made with him and his Carnal Seed, as such is removed, by vertue of which they had their political Church State, and visible Church-membership and all other Fleshly and Legal Priviledges?</p>
            <p>Or do we say, those Jews that believed or their Elect Infants were cast out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace? God forbid.</p>
            <p>No, for if the Children of unbelieving Jews did believe, it shews they are in covenant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. <hi>In a word.</hi> All that believe, let them be whose Children they will, they are all in the Covenant of Grace: For there is now no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, Jews and Gentiles, Old and young, bond and free, are all one in Christ Jesus. Now <hi>no knowing Men after the Flesh, i. e.</hi> upon the account of Fleshly or external Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, by descent from <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh: <hi>Circumcisioa nor uncircumcision, availeth nothing, but a new Creature; old things are past away and all</hi> things are become new 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.</p>

               <hi>Should this Man object and say, as to</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen he speaks of the Sinai Covenant, or the Covenant made with the People of Israel, after they came out of Egypt, and not of the Covenant of circumcision.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> I answer that it is evident where <hi>Paul</hi> excludes the Law as not being of Faith, nor the Covenant of Grace, but opposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, he also excluded upon the same Foot of account circumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>Gal</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25, 26, 27.

                  <hi>note this (saith he) by the way, he hath dropt the 13. verse, wherein is the explanation of the Covenant to be the same God made with Abraham and his Seed.</hi>
               </q> Which verse doth indeed clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew that the Covenant of circumcision was the same (and but a farther establishment of it) with that given in <hi>Horeb, thou shalt enter into Covenant with the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. viz. <hi>That he may establish thee to day, for a People to himself, and that he may be unto thee aGod, as he hath said unto thee, and hath vowed unto thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You ask, <hi>What was the personal actual sin which those young Babes committed at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the Gospel, that provoked God to cast them out of Covenant? for you do own that the Seed of believers were once in Covenant, and were Church-members; but if you cannot prove what the transgression was, then all your arguments ought to be committed to the custody of the Essex Jayl Keeper thus Mr.</hi> Shute.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> You Should first prove it was a gracious priviledge to Babes or the Carnal Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they were in the Legal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and national Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> before you ask that question.</p>
            <p>The Apostle says not, that circumcision was a Priviledg, unless they kept the Law, and by it they were obliged to keep it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and hence it is called a yoke of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>2. It was not for the Sins of little Babes, that the Legal Covenant and Legal Church was dissolved, at the coming in of the Gospel: But it was the will and pleasure of God to take that Covenant away, that he might establish the second and better Covenant. And God it appears hath done Infants no hurt hereby, since the promise of God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> touching Salvation by Christ in the Covenant of Grace stands fast for ever, and is brought in, and established to all the Elect, both of Jews first; and also of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. True, the unbelieving Jews were cast off for not believing, for had they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they had pertaken of like Gospel Grace with those that did believe: But the believing Jews and their Children did no longer abide in that national Church to which they once belonged, nor were their Children until they believed, received into the Gospel Church; yet I affirm that was no Spiritual loss to those Babes, seeing there was no righteousness nor Salvation to be had by the Law, Legal Covenant, nor circumcision.</p>

               </hi> will not say that believers and their Seed only were in the Legal Covenant and in the Legal Church, but all unbelievers also, and their Children who sprung from <hi>Isaacs</hi> Loyns, were in the same Covenant, and were Church-members, and that by Gods appointment too; as far forth as were the godly or believing Jews, and their Children: And Friend, it should appear that among <hi>Abrahams</hi> Carnal Seed there were but a very small remnant that were believers; Tho' all were in the Legal Covenant then, and where Churhmembers.</p>

                  <hi>Answer,</hi> He may perceive he was mistaken, for the <hi>Ax</hi> hath not done with him yet.</p>
               <p>He in the said 5. <hi>Page</hi> abuses that Text, <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promises,</hi> these are his words, <hi>viz. for the promises are better, and that chiefly because cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was changed for Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> Doth the Holy Ghost there refer to this change, or is Baptism a promise or a precept?</p>
               <p>He abuses that Text in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> (saith he meaning circumcision) wherein Infants were chiefly concerned, was such a Yoke as they nor their Fathers were able to bear, they were not able to see their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Flesh cut off, and we have an Instance of this in <hi>Zipporah,</hi> what made her in such <hi>a passion with Moses her Husband, as that she cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him a Bloody Husband twice? Why she tells you her self, it was because of the circumcision.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> In this he seems to charge the Holy God, who appointed and commanded circumcision, as if it was more like a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of criminals than an ordinance of God; as he calls <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>2. Was it from the pain that circumcision put the Infants to, that the Apostle calls it a Yoke, that neither they nor their Fathers could bear? or was it not rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it lay them under an obligation to keep the whole Law? for our Apostle, so says in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>I testifie again to every Man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole Law,</hi> compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25.</p>

               <p>Let him read his <hi>Annotators,</hi> she called her Husband <hi>a bloody Husband</hi> or a <hi>Spouse of Blood,</hi> because she by Blood as it were, redeemed her Husbands Life.

               <p>He says Infants have Faith, yetin <hi>Page</hi> 10. (of his Book) he asketh <hi>what personal Faith a Child is capable of acting in an ordinary way; or what good Fruit such Children are capable to bring forth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. In <hi>Page</hi> 8. he renders those false Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who say <hi>that the Covenant God made with Abraham is</hi> repealed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of circumcision; he may see that we deny that the promise or Covenant of Grace God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> is repealed tho' we say the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of circumcision God made with him is repealed.</p>
               <p>2. Such he says are false Teachers who say the Church State under the Law was Carnal.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Such as deride and Scoff at habitual Faith in dying Infants;</hi> Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> owns not such Faith to be in Infants is he therefore a false Teacher. But how does he prove he derides or Scoffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Such who take upon them the Work of the Ministry without Gods Call, or being gifted or qualified he says are false Teachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such we grant are not true Ministers; but doth not he, think you, refer to such who were not trained up in School Learning? I doubt not but our call from God to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry is as good as others have, tho' may be not every ways so well qualified as we ought; yet humane learning is no qualification left by the Holy Spirit in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 7. he says, <hi>In this Authors former Book he hath by excluding Infants from Baptism ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clud them from Eternal Life and Salvation; dying in their Infancy.</hi> How false that is let all Men Judg who have read Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> Book, he refers unto <hi>Page</hi> 41.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Page</hi> 10. he says, <hi>How wilfully blind and dishonest are you thus falsly to quote my words.</hi> I can see no reason for those Unchristian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, in <hi>Page</hi> 11. he says I suppose he means a long White Shift, as if we Baptized Persons in a White Shift: What sport is here for the Enemies of Religion? <hi>Tho' I deny that Women were Baptized in that undecent immodest shameful way and manner, saith he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He means by Dipping the whole Body: God saith he, <hi>never appointed an ordinance to draw out and gratifie Mens lusts,</hi> Page 11. O see what contempt he doth cast upon that way of Baptising, which all Christians used for many hundred of years in the Church, and which Christ appointed to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>You represent to the World, as if our way of Baptising were immodest, and done not as comely, or of good Report; for this you are to be accountable to the most high God. Friend, if you please to come and see our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Administration of that Ordinance, I doubt not, but you will be convinced of your Error, and be forc'd to say, That the Subject goeth with more Sobriety and Modesty, to the Sacrament of Baptism, than thousands do to the hearing of Gods Word, or to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</p>

               <hi>POSTSCRIPT,</hi> Containing several Arguments (to disprove <hi>Pedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> and to prove Believers only the Subjects thereof:) For Mr. <hi>Gyles Shute</hi> to Answer.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF you will not desist but write again, you are desired to answer these Arguments, the stress of the Controversy lying in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If none are to be baptized by the Authority of the great Commission of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. but such who are first made Disciples by being taught; than Infants, who are not capable to be taught, ought not to be baptized. But none a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to be baptized by the Authority of the great Commission of our Blessed Saviour, but such who are first made Disciples by Teaching. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> Little Babes ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Infant-Baptism was never insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, commanded, or appointed of God, Infants ought not to be baptized. But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism was never instituted, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or appointed of God. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Major;</hi> If one thing may be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised as an Ordinance without an Institution or Command of God, another thing may also; so any Innovation may be let into the Church.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Minor;</hi> If there is an Institution for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis either contained in the great Commission, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where else. But 'tis not to be found in the Commission, nor any where else. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> none will deny.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. None are to be baptized by virtue of the Commission, but such who are discipled by the Word, as I said before, and so the Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies.</p>
            <p>If any should say, Christ commanded his Disciples to baptize all Nations, and Infants are part of Nations, therefore are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. I answer;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If all Nations, or any in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought to be baptized before discipled; then Turks, Pagans, Unbelievers and their Children may be baptized, because they are a great part of the Nations. But Turks, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Unbelievers, and their Children, ought not to be baptized. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides that, Teaching (by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Commission) must go before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, we have proved; which generally al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Learned Men do assert: if the Institution is to be found any where else, they must shew the Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Faith and Repentance are required of all that ought to be baptized. Infants are not required to believe and repent, nor are they capable so to do. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, 8, 10, 16 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and 'tis also asserted by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> What is required of Persons to be baptized? that's the Question. The Answer is, Repentance, whereby they forsake Sin, and Faith, whereby they stedfastly believe the Promise of God made to them in that Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. That Practice that tends not to the Glory of God, nor to the Profit of the Child, when done, nor in after-times when grown up, but may prove hurtful and of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nature to him, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But the Practice of Infant-Baptism tends not to the Glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor to the Profit of the Child when baptized, nor in after-times when grown up, but may prove hurtful and of a dangerous Nature to him. <hi>Ergo.</hi> See <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2. where <hi>Moses</hi> told <hi>Aaron,</hi> because his Sons had done that which God commanded them not, that <hi>God would be sanctified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> unto him;</hi> intimating, that such who did that which God commanded not, did not sanctify or glorify God therein. Can God be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Man's Disobedience, or by adding to his Word; by doing that which God hath not required? <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>In vain do you worship me, teaching for Doctrine the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men:</hi> and that that Practice


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59964:30"/>
doth profit the Child, none can prove from God's Word: And in after-times when grown up, it may cause the Person to think he was thereby made a Christian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and brought into the Covenant of Grace, and had it sealed to him, nay, thereby regenerated, and that Infants are thereby ingrafted also into Christ's Church. Sure all understanding Men know Baptism of Believers is not called Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only metonymically, it being a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Regeneration. But they ignorantly affirm also, that Infants <hi>then</hi> have a federal Holiness; as if this imagined Holiness comes in by the Child's Covenant in Baptism, which may prove hurtful and dangerous to them, and cause them to think Baptism confers Grace, which is a great Error. <q>How can Water, saith Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> an external thing, work upon the Soul physically? Nor can it, saith he, be proved, that ever the Spirit of God is tied by any Promise, to apply himself to the Soul in a gracious Operation, when Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is applied to the Body: If it were so, then all that were baptized were regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, then all that were baptized should be saved, or else the Doctrine of Perseverance falls to the Ground. Some indeed, says he, say, that Regeration is conferred in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism upon the Elect, and exerts it self after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in Conversion. But how so active a Principle as a spiritual Life should lie dead and asleep so many Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceived.</q> On <hi>Regen.</hi> p. 75.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. If the Church of <hi>England</hi> says, that Faith and Repentance are required of all that ought to be baptized, and in so saying, speak truly, and yet Infants can't perform those things; then Infants ought not to be baptized. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> says, that Faith and Repentance are required of all such, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and speak truly, and yet Infants cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form these things. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not to be baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If it be objected, <hi>That they affirm they do perform it by their Sureties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If Suretiship for Children in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is not required of God, and the Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do not, cannot perform those things for the Child: then Suretiship is not of God, and so signifies nothing, but is an unlawful and sinful Undertaking. But Suretiship in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Baptism is not required of God, and they do not, cannot perform what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do they, or can they cause the Child <hi>to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World; and all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh?</hi> In a Word; Can they make the Child or Children to repent and truly believe in Jesus Christ? for these are the things they promise for them, and in their Name. Alas, they want Power to do it for themselves, and how then should they do it for others? Besides, we see they never mind nor regard their Covenant in the Case: and will not God one Day say, Who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired these things at your Hands?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. If there be no Precedent in the Scripture, (as there is no Precept) that any Infant was baptized, then Infants ought not to be baptized. But there is no Precedent that any Infant was baptized in the Scripture. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

If whatsoever which is necessary to Faith and Practice is left in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that being a compleat and perfect Rule, and yet Infant-Baptism is not contained or to be found therein, then Infant-Baptism is not of God. But whatever is necessary to Faith and Practice, is contained in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Infant-Baptism is not to be found therein. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

            <p>As touching the <hi>Major,</hi> I argue thus; That which is an Institution of Christ, the Holy Scripture doth shew, as well the End and Ground of the Ordinance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

have a Right by the Faith of their Sureties. Some ground their Right from an Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tradition; others upon the Authority of Scripture. Some say, All Children of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians ought to be baptized; others say, None but the Children of true Believers have a Right to it.

If no Parents, at any time or times, have been by God the Father, Jesus Christ, or his Apostles, either commended for baptizing of their Children, or reproved for neglecting to baptize them; then Infant-Baptism is no Ordinance of God.

See how <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> sped, for presuming to vary from the Command of God, and <hi>Uzzah,</hi> tho but in small Circumstances as they may seem to us. How dare Men adventure, this being so, to change Baptism from Dipping into Sprinkling, and the Subject, from an Adult Believer, to an ignorant Babe? <hi>Add thou not into his Word,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Whatever Practice opens a Door to any humane Traditions and Innovations in God's Worship, is a great Evil, and to be avoided: But the Practice of Infant-Baptism opens a Door to any humane Traditions and Innovations in God's Worship. <hi>Ergo,</hi> to sprinkle or baptize Infants is a great Evil, and to be avoided.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> will not be denied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear, because there is no Scripture-ground for it, no Command nor Example for such a Practice in God's Word. And if without Scripture-Authority the Church hath Power to do one thing, she may do another, and so <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>

But the Practice of Infant-Baptism reflects on the Honour, Care and Faithfulness of Jesus Christ, and renders him less faithful than <hi>Moses,</hi> and a great Ordinance, (nay, Sacrament) of the New Testament, to lie more dark and obscure than any Precept under the Old Testament. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism cannot be of God.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is easily proved: For he is bold indeed who shall affirm Infant-Baptism doth not lie obscure in God's Word. One great Party who assert it, say, 'tis not to be found in the Scripture at all, but 'tis an unwritten Apostolical Tradition: others say, it lies not in the Letter of the Scripture, but may be proved by Consequences; and yet some great Asserters of it, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and others, say, Those Consequences commonly drawn from divers Texts for it, are without Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so prove nothing. I am sure a Man may read the Scripture a hundred times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and never be thereby convinced; he ought to baptize his Children, tho it is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to convince Men of all other Duties.</p>
            <p>Now can this be a Truth, since Christ who was more faithful than <hi>Moses,</hi> and delivered every thing plainly from the Father? <hi>Moses</hi> left nothing dark as to matter of Duty, tho the Precepts and external Rites of his Law were numerous, two or three hundred Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, yet none were at a loss, or had need to say, Is this a Truth or an Ordinance, or not? for he that runs may read it.</p>
            <p>And shall one positive Precept given forth by Christ, who appointed so few in the New Testament, be so obscure, as also the ground and end of it, that Men should be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Proofs of it, together with the end and ground thereof?

If Baptism is of mere positive Right, wholly depending on the Will and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Pleasure of Jesus Christ, the great Legislator: And he hath not required or commanded Infants to be baptized: then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ought not to be baptized: But Baptism is of mere positive Right, wholly depending on the Will and sovereign Pleasure of Jesus Christ, the great Legislator, and he hath not required or commanded Infants to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Infants ought not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>This Argument tends to cut off all the pretended Proofs of Pedo-Baptism, taken from the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and because Children are said to belong to the Kingdom of Heaven, it was not the Right of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Male Children to be circumcised, because they were begotten, and born of the Fruit of his Loins, till he received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment from God to circumcise them. Had he done it before, or without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God, it would have been Will-Worship in him so to have done. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this further appears to be so, Because no godly Man's Children, nor others in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Days, nor since, had any Right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but only his Children, (or such who were bought with his Money, or were proselyted to the Jewish Religion) because they had no Command from God so to do, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had. This being true, it follows, that if we should grant Infants of believing. Gentiles, as such, were the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (which we deny) yet unless God had commanded them to baptize their Children, they ought not to do it; and if they do it without a Command or Authority from Christ, it will be found an Act of Will-Worship in them.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith, Faith and Repentance is the Condition of the Adult, and as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Condition, I am sure the Scripture is si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; the Way of the Lord is one, <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism,</hi> Ephes. 4. 4.</p>

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 27. If Baptism be Immersion, as to the proper and genuine signification of the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> as also of those Typical and Metaphorical Baptisms and the spiritual Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof; then Sprinkling cannot be Christ's true Baptism. But Immersion is the proper and genuine signification of the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and also of those Typical and Metaphorical Baptisms spoken of, and the spiritual Signification thereof. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Sprinkling is not Christ's true Baptism.</p>
            <p>1. That the proper and genuine Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> is Immersion, or to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have proved, which is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the Learned in that Language.</p>
            <p>2. The Figurative Baptism was, <hi>1st.</hi> That of the Red Sea, wherein the Fathers were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as it were, unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the Sea, and under the Cloud. <hi>Pools Annotations</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. <q>Others, <hi>saith he,</hi> more probably think that the Apostle useth this term, in regard of the great Analogy betwixt <hi>Baptism</hi> (as it was then used) the Persons going down into the Waters, and being dipped in them; and the Israelites going down into the Sea, the great Receptacle of Water, though the Water at that time was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Heaps on either side of them; yet they seemed buried in the Water, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in that Age were when they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>2d.</hi> was that of <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark. See Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull:</hi> 
               <q>The Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Baptism, saith be,</hi> were both a Type and Figure of the Resurrection, not the Sign of the washing away of Sin, though so taken metonymically, but a particular Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Resurrection of Christ: of this Baptism is a lively and emphatical Figure, as also was the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of which he returned as from a Sepulchre,</q> to a new Life.</p>
            <p>3. Metaphorical Baptism is that of the Spirit and of Affliction: the first signifies not a sprinkling of the Spirit, but the great Effusion of the Spirit, like that at <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi> Acts 1. 4, 5. <hi>Shall be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. on which Words <hi>Casaubon</hi> speaks thus: See Dr. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <q>The Greek Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to <hi>dip</hi> or <hi>plunge,</hi> as it were to die Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, in which Sense, <hi>saith he,</hi> the Apostles might be truly said to have been baptized: for the House in which this was done, was filled with the Holy Ghost; so that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles might seem to have been plunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it as in a large Fish-Pond.</q> Also <hi>Oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 2. saith, <q>A Wind filled the whole House, that it seemed like a Fish-Pond, because it was promised to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that they should be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</q> And the Baptism of Affliction are those great depths or overwhelmings of Afflictions, like that of our Saviour's suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>i. e.</hi> no part free; <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 22. where you have the same Greed Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and like that of <hi>David,</hi> who saith, <hi>God drew him out of great Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The spiritual Signification thereof is the Death, Burial and Resurrection of Christ, and of our Death to Sin, and Vivification to a new Life.</p>
            <p>This being so, it follows undeniably Sprinkling cannot be Christ's true Baptism, it must be Immersion, and nothing else.</p>
            <p>And in the last Place, <hi>Finally,</hi> To confirm that <hi>Baptizo</hi> is to <hi>dip,</hi> both from the literal and spiritual Signification thereof, as also from those typical and metaphorical Baptisms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture, I might add further, that this evidently appears from the Practice of <hi>John Baptist</hi> and the Apostles of Christ, who baptized in <hi>Riuers,</hi> and <hi>where there was much Water:</hi> and also, because the Baptizer and Baptized are said to go down <hi>into</hi> the Water, (not down <hi>to</hi> the Water) and came up out of the Water. <hi>John Baptist</hi> is said to baptize them <hi>into Jordan,</hi> as the Greek Word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, which shews it <hi>dipping</hi> and not <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Would it be proper to say, <hi>He sprinkled them into</hi> Jordan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Lord open the Eyes of those who see not, to consider these things.</p>
