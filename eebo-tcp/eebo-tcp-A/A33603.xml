            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis Mornings Goſpel (Sacred Majeſty) were I Maſter of my own choice, would lead me readily to a Subject, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to Your Royal Ears: Offer'd to Me upon the occaſion of the <hi>Anniverſary</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a <hi>Doleful,</hi> and yet <hi>Happy</hi> day; <hi>Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54719:3"/>
for the Departure of Our late <hi>Soveraign</hi> from this Life: Yet <hi>Happy</hi> for the manner of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it. If we look upon his Life, then turn our Thoughts upon the manner of his Death: We ſhall eaſily diſcover, both from the one and the other, how particularly my preſent Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to Him: <hi>A certain Blind man beg'd, and he call'd on Jeſus to have Mercy on him.</hi> We may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parallel the <hi>Blindneſs</hi> of our Beggar in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> with the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> which obſcur'd for a time His Royal Sight; and the <hi>Cryes</hi> of that ſame Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, with the <hi>Penitential Tears</hi> which Bath'd his Death-Bed; and thoſe <hi>Ferverous Ejaculations,</hi> which <hi>Reach'd</hi> ſo effectually the <hi>Ears</hi> of Chriſt: That now with Joy before his <hi>Altars,</hi> we Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the <hi>Anniverſary</hi> Remembrance of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Effect of his Infinite Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How gladly ſhould I enlarge my ſelf upon this Theme, and looſe my ſelf in the Ocean of a long Diſcourſe; were I not checked in my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs by a Complyance I owe to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church, which admits not of Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rights and Solemnities on days (like this) par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Devoted to Her Service. I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forcibly let this Subject fall, and take up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (though none ſo proper) to Entertain Your Royal Preſence with. And thus I begin,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54719:3"/>
THe connexion of thoſe Sacred and Divinely inſpir'd Writings the Holy <hi>Goſpels,</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though peradventure it appears not ſo clearly in the Letter) yet may eaſily be trac'd by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Obſerver in the Myſtery. This may parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly be remark'd in our preſent <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part whereof (though with little appearance of connexion in the Letter) leads us Myſteriouſly to a knowledge of thoſe Truths, which may be gather'd from the Moral of the Latter; that part, I mean, which I've aſſum'd for my Text. At the opening of this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> our Saviour is ſaid to have call d aſide his twelve Diſciples, and to have made to them, a part from the reſt, a Pathetick Diſcourſe upon his approaching Paſſion; but the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> who mentioneth this, ſaith alſo of thoſe ſame <hi>Diſciples,</hi> That they underſtood him not; <hi>Et ipſi nihil horum intellexerunt:</hi> And they underſtood not a word of all this.</p>
            <p>Our Holy Mother the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conduct of Her Great Maſter, Reads to us <hi>Chriſtians</hi> her Diſciples the ſame Diſcourſe: To Prepare us againſt this Holy Time of <hi>Lent</hi> for a Fruitful Communication of his Sufferings. But truly this diſmal Lecture of the Paſſion of Chriſt is Read to us at a Seaſon, in which the Hearts of ſome looſe Livers are ſo little prepar'd to receive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54719:4"/>
the intended Advantages thereby: (This being the Merry time of <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> a Seaſon Dedicated to Sports and Riots; ſo to foreſtall the rugged time of <hi>Penance</hi> with Exceſſes too too Criminal, and Paſtimes at the beſt but dangerous enough:) Their Hearts, I ſay; at this looſe Seaſon are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo little prepar'd for a Leſſon of Suffering and Mortification; (as that is of the Paſſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;)</hi> that of too too many bearing the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with much more reaſon may be verify'd, what was alſo ſaid of his Diſciples: <hi>Ipſi nihil horum intellexerunt:</hi> They did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a word of all this; that is, of all thoſe weighty Maxims of our Religion, which this Mornings <hi>Goſpel</hi> did open to them.</p>
            <p>This argues a ſtrange Blindneſs in the Hearts of Sinners: For the Cure of which, as this men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Paſſage hath led me to the choice of my preſent Text: So I ſhall endeavour to draw from it thoſe Inſtructions which the Moral of it may ſupply me with, both for a right knowledge of this Spiritual Malady, and of the proper Means to Cure it by. Following therefore the method of my Text, I ſhall conſider

               <p>This Blindneſs therefore being the effect of Sin: the chief cauſes of it are as many, as there are in number Capital Vices; which, like Fruitful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, give a Birth and Beginning to all the reſt.

In the Judgment and Practice of the World it is a Croſs, to live in the World without Enjoying it; but in the Judgment and practice of a Chriſtian, thoſe very Enjoyments are a Croſs, becauſe they hinder us in the way of Virtue.

               <p>Such Chriſtian-like performances are, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reflection of the Great <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> ſo many loud and ſounding <hi>Voices,</hi> with which our Lives do call on God, and not barely our Mouths only. But as the Vertuous Actions of the Devout Chriſtian ſound harſh and gratingly in the Ears of Worldings: So he is frequently checked by them, and deſired to hold his Peace. The ſame alſo happen'd to our <hi>Beggar</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> who was rebuked for his clamour by thoſe who in the company of our Saviour went before him, and by them commanded to be ſilent. <hi>Et qui praeibant, increpabant eum ut taceret: And thoſe who went before, rebuked him, that he ſhould hold his Peace.</hi> This very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of our <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is alſo a figure of what too frequently paſſeth in the Church. Thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukers</hi> of the Clamorous Beggar, are Lazy and Scandalous Chriſtians, who make it their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to impede the Vertuous purpoſes of the good: <hi>Bonos Chriſtianos mali &amp; tepidi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner doth the Sinner begin to enter Seriouſly upon a change of Life, to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thoſe Hurtful Liberties which before he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54719:14"/>
took, to withdraw himſelf carefully from the occaſions of ſin: In a word, to live up to the Obligations of his Baptiſm and Religion; No ſooner can a ſinner reſolve on this, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is oppos'd in his Virtuous Deſigns: <hi>Qui diligunt ſaeculum, contradicunt;</hi> The Lovers of the World rebuke him for it. They interpret his Converſion an exceſs of Folly, his new courſe of Life ſome Fit of Melancholly or Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted Zeal, and a ſingularity tacitly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lives of ſo many others, who bear in the World the Name of Chriſtians as well as he. <hi>Et nunquid alii non ſunt Chriſtiani?</hi> And are not others Chriſtians too? Such and ſuch perſons are not ſo ſcrupulous; they think it time enough to take up yet. This Gallant for example continues ſtill his cuſtomary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, his Riots, his Debauches, his Exceſſes in Drinking, Swearing, Gaming, and the like; Yet ask him, what he is, he anſwers you a Chriſtian, and (though we hardly gather it from his Life) perhaps a <hi>Catholick</hi> too. That Lady ſtill expoſes her ſelf to dangerous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, to Scandalous Privacies, which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to ſin; ſtill ſhe ſleeps away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedly the better part of her precious hours (every moment of which might gain her
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54719:15"/>
an Eternity;) or ſhe Dreams them away wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon new Garbs and Faſhions: As if for that concern alone ſhe thought her ſelf plac'd in this World; ſhe is ſtill moſt laviſhly Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in her Dreſs, which makes her as narrow Hearted to the Poor; and yet ſhe is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and a <hi>Catholick</hi> too. In fine, they ſtill conform to the Maxims of the World: They little concern themſelves in the Great Affair of their Salvation, and yet they all pretend to a place in Paradiſe as well as we. But tell us not, (continues the Holy <hi>Doctor,)</hi> tell us not, how ſuch and ſuch do Live, but how the <hi>Goſpel</hi> teaches them to Live, Let them not invite us by their ill example, but rather by the Rule of their Religion, the Doctrine and Life of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. <hi>Non dicant quomodò iſti vivunt tam multi, ſic vivamus. Quare non potius, quomodo dicit Evangelium?</hi>

               <p>But as the malitiouſly ſubtle World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to nipp our Religious Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the very Bud; propoſes on the one ſide the Scandalous Examples of Vicious Livers to invite us: So on the other ſide, it objects the apparent Difficulties which occur to us in the Exerciſe of Virtue, to deter and fright us, It makes a change of Life appear a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54719:15"/>
by Fleſh and Blood: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of our Paſſions, a Combat to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by more than Man: Mortification the Burying of ones ſelf Alive; In fine, it repreſents to us <hi>Penance</hi> with ſuch a ghaſtly and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Viſage, that many Sinners have ſcarcely Courage to look upon it: But this is a Cheat the World puts upon us. The face indeed of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> is a little rough, but her Converſation is Sweet and Delightful. We may properly apply to this Subject the Words of the Learned Moraliſt <hi>Seneca,</hi> which he himſelf made uſe of writing to his Friend, <hi>To Arm him with Courage againſt the Fears of Death Tolle</hi> (ſaid he, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to Death without the ſhew of Fear) <hi>Tolle iſtam pompam, ſub qua lates &amp; ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54719:16"/>
may we alſo ſay of a Life of <hi>Penance; Tolle iſtam pompam ſub quâ lates:</hi> Take, take away that mask of Terrour which diſguiſes thee, to frighten Cowards in Religion! Silence thoſe hard and terrifying Names, of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Self-denyal, Struggling</hi> and <hi>Combating with Fleſh and Blood!</hi> Shew thy ſelf to us in thy proper Colours! <hi>Penitentia es;</hi> Thou art but <hi>Penance:</hi> A Life, this ignorant Plough-man, that tender Girl have paſſed through with Courage, <note place="margin">Aug. lib.

You'l find a Life of <hi>Penance</hi> no ſuch Monſter, when ſuch and ſuch have Courage enough to tame it! And their Examples as ſharp a Spur to Egg you on in the way of Virtue, as thoſe can be of Vicious Livers to draw you back!</p>
               <p>Then let us not be daunted at the Frighful Arguments of the World; but rather ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the example of the Beggar in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> and take<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his method for our Rule. The multitude indeed rebuk'd him for his Clamour;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54719:16"/>
but he increas'd it, inſtead of being Silent at their check: <hi>Increpabant eum ut taceret; ipſe verò multò magis clamabat.</hi> This remarkable circumſtance recommends to us moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the virtue of Conſtancy and Perſeverance in the practice of good Works, as the ſureſt means of ſurmounting thoſe Difficulties, which are often objected to us by Fleſh and Blood, to deter us from the Accompliſhment and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of them: <hi>Perfectio boni operis perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia eſt.</hi> Had the Beggar been daunted at the rebuke of the Multitude, his Prayer had not arriv'd to the Ears of Chriſt. And if every oppoſition can make us turn our backs, we may often enter the Liſts to Fight, but our Cowardiſe will not ſuffer us to be Crown'd.</p>
               <p>We muſt do in our Converſions to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in his Sacrifice, when the Birds deſcended to diſturb him in it, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (as we read in the Book of <hi>Geneſis,)</hi>
                  <note place="margin">15. 11.</note> had prepar'd the Fleſh of certain Victims clean and neat, to offer them in <hi>Holocauſt</hi> to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: But whilſt he was occupy'd in this Religious Care, <hi>Deſcenderunt Volucres ſuper ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davera:</hi> Certain unclean and hungry Birds of Prey, (drawn thither peradventure by the ſcent of the Bodies,) came fluttering about
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54719:17"/>
him, attempting with their durty Beaks and Tallons upon thoſe Sacred Limbs deſigned by him for the <hi>Holocauſt.</hi> What did that Holy Patriarch in this Diſtraction? In this diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of his Devotions? <hi>Abigebat eas;</hi> He drove them unconcernedly away. And as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, he drove them away again; purſuing ſtill with greater Fervour that <hi>Holy Work,</hi> the greater was the Moleſtation he ſuffer'd in it: 'Till at laſt they left him, and undiſturbedly he finiſhed his Sacrifice. So it is with thoſe Sinners who prepare themſelves by a change of Life, to offer up to God Almighty a Grateful Sacrifice of a Contrite Heart. They meet indeed with <hi>Unclean Birds,</hi> that flutter about them to diſturb them too; Theſe are the Temptations of their paſt Life, which often return in their Devotions, attempting to Pollute the Purity of this new Victim with unclean Thoughts; <hi>Luxury</hi> ſlings durt upon our good Reſolutions of living Chaſte; <hi>Gluttony</hi> upon our purpoſes of quitting our Riotous and Debauched Lives; <hi>Sloth</hi> upon our Vigilancy in the Service of God, and the great concern for the Salvation of our Souls; and ſo for the reſt: But drive thoſe <hi>Birds</hi> away. (Parley not with your Temptations) and as they turn upon you, drive them away again. Doubt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54719:17"/>
not, at laſt they'l leave you, that you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbedly compleat your Sacrifice; that is, may perfect the Work of your Converſion, and the Church with Joy may ſee the Fruits thereof.</p>
               <p>Theſe, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are the weighty Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that offer themſelves to our moſt Serious Thoughts upon the Moral Examination of this Text. The Corporal Blindneſs of that Poor Beggar repreſents to us the Spiritual Blindneſs of a Soul in Sin. Which Blindneſs, (if we form a right Conceit of it) is ſo deplorable in regard of ſinful <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding open'd by the Light of Faith, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inſenſible of their Miſery; that properly with their Eyes open, they ſee nothing; <hi>Apertis oculis nihil vident.</hi> Thoſe indeed amongſt us who are deſirous to have their Eye-ſight clear'd, to diſcover their own <hi>Nakedneſs,</hi> (ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery being a principal Diſpoſition to a true Converſion;) have alſo a method given them by our Blind Beggar, how to Addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt for the recovery of their Sight: <hi>Domine, ut videam! Lord, that I may ſee!</hi> He call'd on Chriſt with a loud voice, <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavit;</hi> and ſo muſt we; but (in a ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Sage Advice,) let not barely our Tongues call on him, but our Lives
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54719:18"/>
alſo. The Beggar heard himſelf <hi>Rebuked</hi> by the Multitude, and commanded to hold his Peace, <hi>Increpabant eum ut taceret.</hi> The ſame rough uſage muſt we expect from the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World and VVorldly Livers, whoſe malitious endeavours are to retard our Progreſs in the way of Virtue. Let us then no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them than the Blind man did the Peoples check, that ſo <hi>Our Voice may reach the Ears of Christ.</hi> Vouchſafe us then, dear <hi>Son of David,</hi> as thou didſt the Blind man in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> a Gracious <hi>Reſpice, Look up, and ſee!</hi> Clear our Underſtandings of thoſe Clouds, which Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Ignorance have drawn before them! Grant us the Exerciſe of a lively Faith, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thoſe Sacred Truths, which are conceal'd from the Eye of the VVorld! Purify our Souls from Sin, and render them capable of beholding that Inviſible <hi>Being,</hi> which is only the Object of a <hi>clean Heart.</hi> That arriving to the right knowledge of Thee in quality of our <hi>laſt End,</hi> and <hi>chiefeſt Good,</hi> we may Love Thee, Praiſe Thee, and Enjoy Thee for Ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
