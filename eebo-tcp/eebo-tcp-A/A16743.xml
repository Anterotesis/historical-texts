            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wealth is a Iewell, and pouerty is a plague: Conscience is a charge, and care is a burden.

Opinions differ, and Iudgements vary, and Time trauailes, and Trueth is a vertue, and wisedome an honor: and honor is a title, and Grace a gift, and Patience a blessing, and Content a Kingdome: and so from one thing to another, a trouble in all.

               <p>IT is now the nynth houre, and the Sunne is gotten vp well toward his height, and the sweating Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller beginnes to féele the burthen of his way: The Scholler now falles to conning of his Lesson, and the Lawyer at the Barro falls to pleading of his Case: the Soldier now makes many a weary steppe in his march, and the amorous Courtier almost ready to goe out of his Chamber: The market now growes to bée full of people, and the Shopmen now are in the heat of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: the Faulconers now finde it too hote flying, and the Huntsmen begin to grow weary of their sport: The Byrders now take in their Nets and their Roddes, and the Fishermen send their Fish to the Market: the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and the Ale-house are almost full of Guestes, and <hi>Westminster</hi> and Guild Hall are not without a word or two on both sides: The Carriers now are loading out of Towne, and not a Letter but must bée payd for ere it passe: The Cryer now tryes the strength of his throat, and the Beareward leades his Beare home after his challenge: The Players Billes are almost all set vp, and the Clarke of the Market begins to shew his Office: In summe, in this houre there is much to doe, as well in the City, as the Countrey: And therefore to be short, I will thus make my conclusion: I hold it the toyle of Wit, and the tryall of Reason. Farewell.</p>

            <p>NOw is the Sunne withdrawne into his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, the Windowes of Heauen are shut vp, and silence with darknesse haue made a walke ouer the whole Earth, and Time is tasked to worke vpon the worst Actions: yet Uertue being her selfe, is neuer weary of well doing, while the best spirits are studying for the bodies rest: Dreames and Uisions are the Haunters of troubled spirits, while Nature is most comforted in the hope of the morning: the body now lyes as a dead lump, while sleepe, the pride of ease, lulls the Senses of the Sloathfull: the tired Limbs now cease from their labours, and the studious braines giue ouer their businesse: the Bed is now an image of the Graue, and the Prayer of the Faithfull makes the Pathway to Heauen: Louers now enclose a mutuall content, while gracious minds haue no wicked imaginations: Théeues, Wolues, and Foxes, now fall to their pray, but, a strong locke, and a good wit, will aware much mischiefe: and he that trusteth in God will be safe from the Deuill.</p>
