         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

are to be reckoned more Noble. Neuertheleſſe,
there is no one man knowne, that determinately
hath cenſured, what one creature among thoſe of

Herehence grew the reaſon, that men of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the number of ſo many auncient writers that hath
looked into the Aſſes kinde, finding him to be the
moſt compleat, perfect, and the very Nobleſt beaſt,
among all the reſt that nature euer gaue life vnto

But the worſt is, that the foreſaid writers haue
ſhewen,<note place="margin">The fault of the former writers.</note> I will not ſay little iudgement, but indeed
farre leſſe conſcience, being ſo ouer impudently
bold, in ſeruing their turnes with authorities of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

the meaning therof neither ſhould or ought be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

the more worthie ſeuere puniſhment, for inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
haue they giuen to words of the olde and
new Teſtament, other expoſitions then ſhould ſo
be made of them.</p>
            <p>Concerning what I intend to ſay,<note place="margin">The Authors purpoſe in his proceeding.</note> I meane to
draw my prooues from ſence, reaſon, authoritie, as
alſo examples of men ſkilfull and learned: to the
end, that this age of ours may be throughly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the trueth of the matter I vndertake, not to
leaue buried in blinde obliuion, thoſe admirable
qualities, which makes this beaſt, not onely more
perfect and Noble then the other, but the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt
and Nobleſt of all other.</p>
            <p>And that I ſtand fearleſſe of murmuring toongs,<note place="margin">The Authors proteſtation to the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note>
cutting taunts, firſt and foremoſt I proteſt to thee,
who (with aſcancing lookes) make profeſsion of
prying into other mens workes: that in the whole
ſubiect of the matter, they ſhall find nothing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh
againſt, except after they haue peece-meale
turnd it ouer, they chaunce to light on ſome error in
the Orthographie. Then ere they offer to teare this
my Aſſe-defending imprefe, I would let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that I mooued to write it by a ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
<pb facs="tcp:4685:4"/>
that the fortune hereof would be faire,
good &amp; conformable, to their Aſſe-fauouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
            <p>If they accept it,<note place="margin">The Authors reaſon, why his booke is not to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked.</note> as reaſon requires they ſhould,
deſpight of all malicious enuie, themſelues ſhall
ſoone perceiue, that mine intent is good &amp; honeſt;
whence may enſue this concluſion, that this work
of mine, notwithſtanding how earnestly ſoeuer it is
written on the Aſſes behalfe, deſerues to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended:
either becauſe (as I haue ſaid) it is honeſt
and good, or for the deſire I haue it ſhould prooue
no otherwiſe. But what anſwere ſhall I make the
fooliſh, or to backbiting maligners: when (being
caught within their Griffen-like talents) they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to make an Anatomie of me?</p>
            <p>In ſooth I know not what other anſwer I ſhould
make to fooles,<note place="margin">How fooles and maligners are to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> then only not to regard them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(in reaſon) they cannot well blame another
bodies actions, till firſt they know how to rule and
manage their owne. To the maligners I ſay, that in
vſing me ſo hardly, it is the eaſier diſcerned how
they can detract, and ſpeake of others as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
But if I light into the hands of wiſe &amp; good
men; I ſhall be aſſured, that they not knowing how
to ſpeake euil, will neuer ſay of me otherwiſe then
well.</p>
            <p>Heereto I may likewiſe adde,<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene fooles and wiſe men.</note> that if by lawe a
paine were appointed, that ſuch as would not read
this Aſſe-maintaining treatiſe of mine, ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be hindered from walking abroad, they might
<pb facs="tcp:4685:4"/>
account it hard. But each one being at libertie to
reade or leaue it, they may likewiſe in reaſon ſpare
me this freedom, of giuing or withholding it from
the print.</p>
            <p>Then ſuch as pleaſe to reade,<note place="margin">Read that wil, &amp; leaue that will.</note> let them reade, and
ſuch as will not, let them leaue it. But this I may
well ſay to ſuch as read it, and yet receiue not that
taſte and Aſſe-delighting pleaſure they expected,
that mens vnderſtandings are diuers, and therefore
poſsibly it may be, that they differ farre from ſuch,
who doubtleſſe ſhall finde therein a ſauour of ſome
ſweetneſſe. They that but beginning to read, finde
neither words or ſence fitting their humour: they
may ſoone reſolue on no further loſſe of time, but ſo
giue ouer, and proceed no further.</p>
            <p>Yet admit they go on, and read it out to the end,
the blame notwithſtanding will bee theirs, who
made it after mine owne minde, and not to anſwere
theirs.<note place="margin">A reaſonable admonition of the Author</note> Yea, their ſhame will be the greater, when
they ſhall detect the worke, that hath no ſence but
what defendes the Aſſe. And more agreeing is it
with reaſon, that they ſhould rather checke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues:
ſeeing without any taſte of delight, they
were ſo ſimple to proceed in reading this Aſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe,
a poſſeſsion whereof they may (perhaps) find
in themſelues, a long while after.</p>
            <p>Nor would I (learned Readers) that any of you
ſhould enter into conceit, that I had ſo much of the
Aſſe in mee, as made mee bring to light this Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Aſſe, otherwiſe then to purge ſome
<pb facs="tcp:4685:5"/>
ſhort pleaſure of this world.<note place="margin">The Authors cenſure of himſelfe.</note> For I am aſſured, that
it will be thought a moſt fooliſh fopperie, a proud
folly, or rather the verie proudeſt foolerie in the
world: by reaſon the world hath bin ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
yeares, without knowledge of the Aſſes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
and happily it might haue continued ſo
ſtill to the end, had not I vndertooke this Aſſe-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
labour: to make knowne the Aſſe in his
kind (as I haue ſaid) to be the moſt Noble, not only
of the before named fiue ſorts of fiue footed beaſts,
but of other beſide, that euer were produced by
our mother nature. Which I doubt not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh,
albeit I haue gathered into this currant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
the properties, vertues, graces, excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and naturall gifts, of thoſe beaſts whereof the
former fiue ſeuerall kindes haue made mention. To
the end, that they contending to be equall with the
Aſſe, it may generally appeare to them that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and truth wil be perſwaded, the ſentence ought
be pronounced on the Noble Aſſes behalfe.</p>

contented with allowance of ſimpleſt meat: but
likewiſe he is moſt manerly in drinking, which was very
well noted by our Poet, when he ſaid;
<q>

men hath more need, then of the Aſſe. He breakes the earth
with the plough, draweth great burthens for the mill, the
bakehouſe, and carrieth corne from place to place, ſo that
his labour is beyond all other. There is no Towne, no
houſe, and laſtly no place, that can imploy a more neceſſary
beaſt then the Aſſe is.</p>
               <p>Commodiouſly with necke,<note place="margin">No beaſt ſo neceſſary as the Aſſe.</note> ſhoulders, and all his whole
bodie, can he draw, beare, and carry vp &amp; downe, all kindes
of graine, and all things neceſſary for the vſe of man: ſo is
<pb facs="tcp:4685:11"/>
there no other beaſt that can do it, or is ſo apt for it.</p>
               <p>The Horſſe, Mule, and Oxe, are apt to draw and beare
great lading: yet enter they not the houſe, or if they be
brought in, it is forcibly by ſtripes, or ſuch like prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
But the Aſſe, verie mildely, or rather familiarly,
yea, at a nod or becke only, goes euery where at his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
pleaſure. Into by-places, lodgings, halles, chambers,
vp the ſtaires into Grayneries, carrying thither all things
beſéeming each place: aſcending and deſcending very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
being not troubled with the impediment of hornes,
as the Oxe is, nor headſtrong, or vntoward to driue, as the
Horſſe and Mule are.</p>
               <p>His maiſter is not moleſted with thought or griefe, to
make his prouiſion for all the yeare, as ye ſée what care is
had for all other beaſts: becauſe (as hath bene alreadie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared)
he giues himſelfe tr all ſorts of meates.</p>
               <p>By the way as he goes (although he be loaden) hée
takes his féeding, and let him come into what place ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
he will catch a bit, if commodiouſly he may. When it
ſo falles out, that he happens to ſtand two or three dayes
without meate, he is not therefore offended with his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
nor makes any murmure there at by his voyce. Hée
makes no ſigne of chuſing his meate, by any kinde of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
as the horſſe doth by often neighing and ſtamping
with his féet, if prouender be not brought him at time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient.
But the Aſſe, whether he féede or faſt, ſtill goes
to beare his ordinary burthens.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>And yet he is ſo curteous and diuine,</l>
                  <l>That, as the auncient prouerbe ſpeakes of him,</l>
                  <l>Water he drinkes himſelfe, for other carries wine.</l>
               </q>
               <p>We know that all kindes of beaſts were created by
God, for the ſeruice of man: but what beaſt can ye finde,
<pb facs="tcp:4685:11"/>
wherewith man may more be ſerued, then the Aſſe? He,
beſide all the commodities whereof alreadie we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
yet neceſſary for man: ſuffer the bridle to be put in
his mouth, carries the ſaddle, and endures all other kinde
of harneſſe for horſemanſhip, greatly reioycing therein;
whereby our Poet procéeding in his praiſe, ſaith:
<q>
                     <l>His trappings are inough for him each day,</l>
                     <l>Oft with his ſaddle doth he feaſt himſelfe,</l>
                     <l>And ſeemes a Tully, if ſo ſpeake we may.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When hée is on the way adorned with his maiſter on
his backe, not a little doth he delight him with his ſwéete
trot, and ſo paceth lightly on, without any wearineſſe to
his ryder.</p>
               <p>Mooued (as I imagined) by theſe and other his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
quallities, nature our moſt louing mother giue him
a priuiledge, whereof he only might vaunt aboue all other
creatures in the world. And this it is, that he is neuer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted
with any of this hated ſmall vermine, which we call
Lice: and this very elegantly was noted by our Poet <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libato,</hi>
when of his gifts and praiſes, thus he ſung.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>One other gift this beaſt hath as his owne,</l>
                  <l>Wherewith the reſt could not be furniſhed:</l>
                  <l>On man himſelfe the ſame was not beſtowne,</l>
                  <l>To wit: on him is ne're engendred</l>
                  <l>The hatefull vermine that doth teare the ſkin,</l>
                  <l>And to the bode doth make his paſſage in.</l>
               </q>
               <p>An other priuiledge is ſollumne to himſelfe, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
moſt bounteouſly hath beſtowed it on him: which is
(as <hi>Plinie</hi> faithfully reporteth) that the hearbe vulgarely
called <hi>Ferula,</hi> ſodeinly killeth all other beaſts that eates
thereof, except the Aſſe, who thereon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eedes boldly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any dread of harme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4685:12"/>
Beſide this, he hath no gall within him, as by Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
hard euidently appeared: a proofe ſufficient inough,
without calling <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to witneſſe, who confeſſeth the
ſame in his fourth booke of the parts of beaſts.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is not to be meruailed at, that ſo brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
he goeth with all beaſts, and trauelleth with man ſo
quietly: which likewiſe was regarded by the ſame Poet,
when he ſaid:
<q>
                     <l>The Aſſe doth neuer harme, nor vſe deceit,</l>
                     <l>As do the Foxe and Wolfe, of rauenous minde:</l>
                     <l>Who ſtill for ſpoyle lye all the yeare in wait,</l>
                     <l>He boldly braues not any other kinde.</l>
                     <l>To ſuch as rydes him, he procures content,</l>
                     <l>And is a foe to warre or brabblement.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Such as delight themſelues in ryding on the Aſſe, ſéem
to haue no common or vulgare iudgement, becauſe they
make choyſe of the very nobleſt beaſt, that euer was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by nature. Wherfore it is not to be thought ſtrange,
why our Poet exhorteth to ryde on him, ſaying:
<q>
                     <l>Who would not go on foote, and yet deſires</l>
                     <l>An ambling Haqueney, or fine paced lennet:</l>
                     <l>Ryde he the Aſſe, that neuer failes or tires.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Afterward, to honor the Aſſe the more, thus he procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A good regard (by nature) hath the Aſſe,</l>
                  <l>In Alexandria when to ryde they pleaſe,</l>
                  <l>They vſe none elſe, nor in the Eaſt like caſe:</l>
                  <l>But we that neuer can our mindes appeaſe,</l>
                  <l>But we that neuer can our mindes appeaſe,</l>
                  <l>With what our country yeelds by natures grace,</l>
                  <l>Seeke Dolphins on the lulles, Woolues in the ſeas.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4685:12"/>
The ſame Poet, to confirme how pleaſing the delight
of ryding on the Aſſe is, declares in a fewe verſes, a little
merrie ſtorie, in this maner.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A Penſiue man I met vpon the way,</l>
                  <l>Ryding no faſter then his Aſſe would goe:</l>
                  <l>His ſadneſſe grew thereby as ſome did ſay.</l>
                  <l>One ryding faſter yet in ſcorne would know</l>
                  <l>His cauſe of griefe: whereon poore man (quoth he)</l>
                  <l>Ryde faſter, and this fit will ſoone be gon:</l>
                  <l>Wherewith he turned, angry as might be,</l>
                  <l>Saying: My friend, leaue me, and ryde thou on.</l>
                  <l>I am to iourney as beſt liketh me,</l>
                  <l>This pace ſo ſweet, and pleaſing to my minde:</l>
                  <l>Is my delight; when gallopping like thee,</l>
                  <l>Such pleaſure and content I ſhould not finde.</l>
               </q>
               <p>That the Aſſe is a beaſt, as apt to be taught as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant,
and goes very farre beyond him, though daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſhewes vs much, yet ſhall it not be offenſiue for
me to recount an Aſſe-fauouring hiſtorie, which maiſter
<hi>Iohn Lyon,</hi> a moſt diligent and faithfull Coſmographer
of <hi>Affrica,</hi> noteth in the eight part of his great volumme,
where deſcribing what notable things are found in <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
he diſcourſeth on matters concerning the great Cittie
of <hi>Cayro,</hi> and (among other) ſpeaketh thus as followeth.</p>
               <p>Hither were brought many pleaſant ieſtes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch as teach Cammels, Aſſes and Dogges to daunce, a
ſight very pleaſing to behold, chiefly in the Aſſe: for at a
certaine time, one of theſe Ieſters, when his Aſſe had dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a while, ſpeaking to him, ſaid in this maner:</p>
               <p>The Soldane meanes to erect a goodly building, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ſhall néede to imploy all the Aſſes in <hi>Cayro,</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of lime, ſtone, and other neceſſary things. At theſe
words, the Aſſe ſodeinly fell to the grounde, turning his
<pb facs="tcp:4685:13"/>
héeles vp toward heauen, his belly ſwollen, and his eyes
cloſed, euen in ſuch ſort as if he had bene dead. Then fell
the man to many lamentable circumſtances, how he had
loſt his Aſſe, and entreated the by ſtanders, that they wold
helpe to requite him with another, and therefore to make
ſome gathering among them: yet they ſaide, they did not
imagine his Aſſe to be dead, albeit he ſtirred not, but knew
his counterfeit drift was, to get himſelfe ſome money and
prouender for his beaſt. Then they turned to the Aſſe, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to ariſe: but he ſtirred not, although they labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him with many ſtripes, and could not get to riſe by all
their endeuour: then the man purſuing his former prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
ſaid to the ſtanders by;</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I giue ye all to vnderſtand, how the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
hath cauſed to be publiſhed by ſound of Trompet, that
to morrow all the people in <hi>Cayro</hi> muſt goe forth to ſée his
tryumph: commaunding all the faire gentlewomen in
the Cittie, to be mounted on goodly Aſſes, afterward, the
beaſts ſhall eate good barley, and drinke the pure water
of <hi>Nylus.</hi> No ſooner had the Ieſter ſpoken theſe words,
but the Aſſe leapt vp on his féet, and brauely ſhewed ſigns
of excéeding contentment: whereon the Ieſter thus began
againe.</p>
               <p>I heare it for credible, that a certaine peazant of the
Countrey where I was borne, hath euen now made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
to me, that this faire Aſſe of mine, might ſerue his
foule ill fauoured wife to ryde on. The Aſſe, at theſe ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
(as if he had humane vnderſtanding) laid downe his
cares flat, and beganne to goe about halting, feyning as if
he had bene ſtarke lame. Then ſaid the Ieſter; doth yoong
and faire women pleaſe thée? Heereat the Aſſe merely
lifted vp his head, euen as if he had replied, that they
did.</p>
               <p>His maiſter procéeding ſaid; Here are many both yoong
and faire: ſhewe me which of them beſt liketh thée. The
<pb facs="tcp:4685:13"/>
Aſſe running to make ſearch, where diuers women ſtood
to behold him, and making choyſe of the verie faireſt and
moſt honourable, to her he went, and touched her with his
head. Then all the ſtanders by cried with a loude voyce:
<hi>Behold the Ladie of the Aſſe,</hi> as making a merie ieſt of
the matter. And the man mounting on his Aſſe, rode to
ſhewe his quallities elſe where.</p>
               <p>But what greater example of an Aſſes inſtruction can
we alleadge, then that which <hi>Ammonius Alexandrinus,</hi> a
Philoſopher of no meane eſtéeme, affirmeth? to wit, that
he had an Aſſe was his ſcholler, and came ordinarily to
hear his readings. This meruell moued our Poet to ſing:
<q>
                     <l>There was an Aſſe once ſo ingenious,</l>
                     <l>As moſt attentiuely he heard the skill:</l>
                     <l>Of that praiſe-worthie man Ammonius.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But whither wander I, to gather matter of his praiſe
in this print? when it might ſuffiſe me only to ſpeake of
him, that which followeth in our Poets <hi>Canto,</hi> that is:
<q>
                     <l>In ſooth I thinke that who ſo giues his minde,</l>
                     <l>T'obſerue his ieſtures, by good proofe ſhall ſee:</l>
                     <l>To Mathematique skill he is enclinde,</l>
                     <l>Becauſe without reach of Aſtrologie:</l>
                     <l>Aboue the reſt he doth the ſpring deſcrie,</l>
                     <l>For alwaies by his voyce the ſame is told,</l>
                     <l>When as he feedes, and delueth with his foote:</l>
                     <l>Or to the earth holds downe his head, be bold,</l>
                     <l>Raine doth enſue, to bide is no boote.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>How wiſe and well aduiſed (beſide all this) the Aſſe
appeares to be, I think there is not any man in the world
but remembers &amp; knows it wel inough: becauſe he wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
return any way, where he hath once ſtumbled or falne.
<pb facs="tcp:4685:14"/>
And although he may be enforced thereto by his maiſters
ſtripes, yet he hath a very reſpectiue care of his ſtepping
his foote in the former place of offence: as with great wit
our Poet noteth the ſame, ſaying;
<q>
                     <l>Oh that the Aſſe were but ſo happie bleſt,</l>
                     <l>To haue a tongue (as men haue) to diſcloſe</l>
                     <l>How much his thoughts with vertues are poſſeſt,</l>
                     <l>Then would his deeds reueale what hidden goes.</l>
                     <l>For in what place ſo ere he haps to fall,</l>
                     <l>Heel'e nere returne to hurt himſelfe withall.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We cannot deny, but that the Aſſe ſerueth as a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,
and moſt ſinguler example of patience, becauſe it is
a vſuall thing for fathers, mothers, and ſuch like, ſimply to
aduiſe their children or friendes, that in affaires of this
world, they ſhould ſéeme to haue the backe of an Aſſe: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that it behoues them (in all things) to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with patience.</p>
               <p>Should we ſpare to ſpeake of his conſtancie, wherwith
how much he is endued, the Aſſe which was ſo diſpleaſed
with them of <hi>Padua,</hi> doth very well declare. For they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
drawne into the Cittie, the water of * <hi>Bacchiglione,</hi>
where firſt of all the Aſſe vſed ordinarily to drinke: ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly
did he ſhew himſelfe offended at this water min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling,
as it is impoſſible euer after to make him drinke of
that water. And herehence grew the Prouerbe: <hi>All Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua
had not the power to make the Aſſe drinke,</hi> by reaſon
he perſeuered moſt conſtantly in his honourable reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In regard whereof, if we would giue him that due,
which we owe as a debt.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>A hood we ſhould prouide the Aſſe by right,</l>
                  <l>As to a perſon that ſo well deſerues it:</l>
                  <l>Shapte like the birds that ſingeth ſtill by night.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4685:14"/>
But to kéep nothing from him that is reputed of worth,
yet hold him ſtill in eſtéeme, and render him ſuch honour
as is conuenient for him: let it ſuffiſe vs, before we offer
in ought to deſpiſe him, that firſt we call to memorie, that
through contemning and reprouing the Aſſe, ſome notable
daunger hath enſued: yea, matter of death.</p>
               <p>Who knowes not what happened to great King <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
becauſe he offered wrong to the Aſſe? Let them looke
on his picture, and they ſhall ſée his eares ſhaped like to
the Aſſes. And therefore very wiſely our Poet wrote of
him, ſaying.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>King Mydas that the Aſſe ſo iniured,</l>
                  <l>To his owne ſhame by Bacchus was reproou'd:</l>
                  <l>And had ſuch chaſtiſement as he deſerued.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But let vs ſpeake of ſome, who by the meanes of ſuch
wrongs offered, haue brought themſelues to the extrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt
point of death.</p>
               <p>There are now certaine yeares paſt, ſince I being in
<hi>Zara,</hi> a citie of <hi>Sclauonia,</hi> I ſawe one led to the gallowes
to be executed, whoſe name was <hi>Iiacomo Schiffalaſino,</hi>
who being firſt brought to priſon among other malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and by the diſcréet Iudge appointed to the torture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſhould confeſſe wherein they had offended, (he not
hauing any detection wherewith to charge them, or that
was ſufficient to touch them as they ſhould be.) But firſt
he beganne to conſider on the ſirname of <hi>Schiffalaſino,</hi> and
approuing that ſir-name for a ſufficient detection, terrified
him thereby ſo ſtrictly, and in ſuch ſort, as the poore man
confeſſed the faults, which both he and his companions had
committed. Whereupon, he cauſed him with the reſt, to
be hanged by the neckes, and (as the common prouerbe is)
ſent them to ſhake their héeles againſt the winde.</p>
               <p>If this example may not be thought ſufficient, let vs
<pb facs="tcp:4685:15"/>
then call to mind the death of <hi>Philemon</hi> the Philoſopher,
who tooke offence at one of his Aſſes, that in token of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
or magnificent minde, put forth himſelfe to eate of

his maiſter. Hereat he fell into ſuch extremitie of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or deriſion, that there ſodeinly he died; as our Poet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
excellently ſinging, affirmeth,
<q>
                     <l>Philemon when his Aſſe he had eſpied,</l>
                     <l>To eate of Figges prepared for his table:</l>
                     <l>Such was his laughter, that therein he died.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But if contrariwiſe we would conſider, what good and
happie ſucceſſe hath enſued, ſuch encounters wherein the
Aſſe hath receiued no iniurie, we might the more eaſily
reſolue to honor and hold them in ſuch eſtéeme, as fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
diuining auguries haue deſerued to be. And whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hath made diligent obſeruation of them, ſhall finde
they haue ſaued the liues of many, yea in doubtfull bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
and moſt bloodie fights, they ſhewed before hand aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
victorie.</p>
               <p>What ſaued the life of great <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> who had
bene Conſull ſix times, but only an Aſſe? whoſe ieſtures
be diligently obſeruing, when by the <hi>Minturnes</hi> he was
committed priſoner to <hi>Fauuias</hi> houſe: where he noted how
ſwiftly he ruſht out of doore, and ranne to drinke at the née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
fountaine.</p>
               <p>He then aduiſing on this progreſſe of the Aſſe, ſayd:
That the Goddes had ſent this beaſt before hand, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that by his ſodeine running to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ountaine, he ſhould
receiue thereby moſt certaine augurie, that there was no
other meane left for him to eſcape with life, then by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Whereupon, (hauing gotten forth of the aforeſaid pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
he went and imbarqued himſelfe at the next port, and
fled into <hi>Affrica,</hi> where he ſaued himſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vincentio Cartari,</hi> in his booke of Images of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Gods, ſaith, that the <hi>Ambraciotti</hi> and <hi>Sicioni,</hi> people
of <hi>Greece,</hi> being in warre togither, an ambuſh was laide
<pb facs="tcp:4685:15"/>
in a wood, to intrap them that were to iſſue forth of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
At the ſame time it happened, that a man driuing his
Aſſe toward the Citie, with certaine lading on his backe,
his beaſt (by chance) ſented a ſhée Aſſe going before, which
made him follow after, braying ſo loud as poſſibly he could.
And pacing on faſter then his maiſter would willingly he
ſhould, both the Aſſes (at length) began to bray togither,
each beaſt anſwering the other, falling and riſing with
their voyces, in ſuch ſtraunge and confuſed noyſe, that the
<hi>Sicioni</hi> (terrified with the murmure) were glad to be gone
from where they laie hid, and ſo betooke themſelues to
flight. The <hi>Ambraciotti</hi> being aduertiſed thereof, purſued
and ouerthrew them.</p>
               <p>Afterward they made a goodly Aſſe of mettall, which
they ſent to be offred at <hi>Delphos,</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
for a memorie of their good fortune by the Aſſe: and
which they perſwaded themſelues had not elſe happened
to them, but only by that ſingular beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Higinus</hi> the Hiſtorian, recordeth, that when the Goddes
<hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Vulcan</hi> fought with the Giants, they entred
the battaile mounted on Aſſes.</p>
               <p>We read likewiſe in <hi>Hedorotus,</hi> the father of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
hiſtorie, that <hi>Darius</hi> going to warre againſt the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
led with him a great nomber of Aſſes, that only by
their noyſe and braying, made all the enemies horſes take
them to their héeles. Afterwards the <hi>Scithians</hi> comming
to aſſault <hi>Perſia,</hi> their horſes were againe ſo affrighted
with the dreadfull voyce of Aſſes, as they fled, and could not
be enforced to abide.</p>
               <p>Our Poet, by theſe and ſuch like effects, being earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſollicited, very elegantly ſingeth in this maner.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Forced to flight by his commaunding crie,</l>
                  <l>A mightie Armie did the Aſſe diſmay:</l>
                  <l>By Scithians brought to warre, yet glad to flie.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Beholde then, whether wee haue good cauſe or no, to
holde the Aſſe in all eſtimation: yet in theſe vnthankfull
<pb facs="tcp:4685:16"/>
dayes of ours, we ſée him folde for a moſt baſe, or rather a
vile price: albeit in elder ages he was of dearer value then
euer was any other beaſt in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> rehearſeth, that in his time an Aſſe was
ſolde for ſeuentie <hi>Seſtertiaes:</hi> which according to <hi>Budeus</hi>
and other Computiſts, amounteth to the ſumme of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
and fiue hundred crownes. Moreouer he addeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that he ſawe foure Aſies rated at foure hundred <hi>Seſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plinie</hi> teſtifieth, that an Aſſe was ſold for a very great
number of Crownes, albeit the certaine ſumme I doo not
now readily remember, but any one may reade it truly ſet
downe, in the ſeuenth booke of his naturall hiſtorie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lampridius</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
when he would beſtow a magnificent gift on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Rome,</hi> vſed to giue them certaine Aſſes: meaning,
that a ſpeciall and rare eſtimation conſiſted therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
indéed it was the gift of an Emperour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus Polus,</hi> in the firſt booke of his voyage to the
great Cane of <hi>Cathaia,</hi> the eleuenth Chapter, where he
ſpeaketh of the Perſian kingdome, ſaith; In this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
are there likewiſe Aſſes, the very faireſt and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
that are in the world, which are wont to be ſooner ſold
then horſes. And the reaſon is, becauſe they eate leſſe, and
beare greater burthens: beſide, they diſpatch more myles
in a day, then the Horſes or Mules are able to do, nor can
they endure ſo much labour as the Aſſes will.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Merchants of thoſe parts going from
one Prouince to another, paſſe through great deſarts and
ſandie places, where growes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hearbes or graſſe at all:
and by reaſon of the great diſtance of wells and ſwéete wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
they make their dayes iourney the longer, wherefore
the more gladly they vſe theſe Aſſes, becauſe they are ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
runne better, and ſerues them with very ſmall expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They vſe Camells like wiſe, who beare great lading,
<pb facs="tcp:4685:16"/>
and are not chargeable: but yet they are not ſo ſwift as
their Aſſes.</p>
               <p>But let vs admit that the Aſſe had not theſe vertues,
nor that there were founde in him any of the quallities
whereon we haue diſcourſed: yet can we not deny, but he
hath one only gift, which in Nobilitie &amp; perfection, makes
him alone to ſurpaſſe any other kinde of beaſt whatſoeuer
(I meane thoſe vnreaſonable) that euer nature brought
foorth. For the neuer meant to produce the kindes of he or
ſhée Mules, whereas the Aſſe is the only cauſe they are
engendred, and maintains them in the world, to the great
commoditie of man, as daily experience ſufficiently teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.
Wherefore our Poet thus ſings thereof.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The Aſſe was reckoned by his great deſerts</l>
                  <l>Moſt honorable, and who him moleſted:</l>
                  <l>According to their faults were puniſhed.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But becauſe I would drawe to an ende, I conclude,
that of his honorable qualities, worthie all commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I haue not as yet declared the leaſt particuler: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
they are ſuch and ſo great, that whoſoeuer would col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them all togither, may as eaſily conuey all the water
of the ſea into a little glaſſe, or contend with a thing that
of it ſelfe is infinite.</p>
               <p>Yet will I not ſo giue ouer, but adioyne to the ende of
this firſt part, that which our Part firmely beléeued of the
Aſſe, when he ſaid,
<q>
                     <l>In learned Schooles, for wiſedome might he read,</l>
                     <l>But infinite I know therewith diſpence:</l>
                     <l>And do that office in his excellence.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In concluſion, for whatſoeuer either hath bene or may
be ſaid, the nature of the Aſſe is good, pleaſing, humble and
<pb facs="tcp:4685:17"/>
curteous: which foure rare quallities, are farre contrary
to the theft, pride, vnrulineſſe and villany of other beaſts.</p>

            <p>ALl the matters wherof we haue ſpoken in the former
part, to ſhewe the perfection and Nobleneſſe of the
Aſſe, I may ſafely affirme to be of little or no auaile at all,
or profitable in ought to humane kinde: conſidering what
benefit is to be receiued by his excrements, as alſo from
the members of his bodie, after he is dead.</p>
            <p>But to the end that all men (of what condition ſoeuer)
may perceiue I ſpeake nothing but the truth, I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in this ſecond part, to make choyſe of other matters
then is before. Beginning with his fleſh, which when the
Aſſe is yoong, is very ſauourie and delicate, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with all other ſorts of fleſh whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>And though it be not in vſe, as the fleſh of the Calfe,
Kidde, or ſuch like: queſtionleſſe the reaſon may be, that
nature, the moſt wiſe preſeruer of all kindes of beaſtes,
<pb facs="tcp:4685:17"/>
hath prouided that man ſhall not be drawen with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to eate thereof, but firſt hath rather choſen to put into
our mindes, that ſuch as heare the meaning of ſuch fleſh,
are wont to make a ſcornfull looke thereat. And this may
be to the end, that if perhaps men ſhould taſte therof, they
would become ſo coueting thereafter, as deſpiſing al other
kindes of fleſh, they would giue themſelues only to féede
on the Aſſe, whereby ſodeinly might enſue the deſtruction
of the Aſſes kinde: and ſo they ſhould become of ſuch deare
value, as they were in the times wherof alreadie we haue
ſpoken, as <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſawe them ſolde, and <hi>Plinie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth.</p>
            <p>Herehence doubtleſſe would ariſe this hurt, that poore
men, who maintaine themſelues and family by the helpe
of an Aſſe onely, ſhould not be able to buy any, not hauing
the meanes to laie out ſo great a ſumme of mony.</p>
            <p>That this kinde of fleſh in ſwéetneſſe excell all other,
the noble men in the kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> are ſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
for I haue heard of a Scottiſh Gentleman, who in
Sciences hath made ſo great profit, as the principall ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in all <hi>Italy</hi> haue not a little admired him, when he
heard that ſuch a miſerable ſlaughter of Aſſes was made
in <hi>Mantua.</hi> The aforeſaid Gentleman affirmed to me,
that no banquet in <hi>Scotland</hi> was reputed of any value,
where the fleſh of a young Aſſe was not to be had.</p>
            <p>In the good and memorable time of <hi>Pius Quartus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
they not to make a vſuall ſeruice therof, both in feaſts
and banquets of greateſt importance? And if the rounde
table of the mightie Lord of <hi>T.</hi> called <hi>Triclinium,</hi> could
ſpeake, hardly would be credited the quantitie of Aſſes
fleſh, which in thoſe times was eaten thereon.</p>
            <p>And did not <hi>Mecenates</hi> vſe Aſſes fleſh, as a foode moſt
delicate?</p>
            <p>We read at a certaine time, in the Citie of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4685:18"/>
an Aſſes head was ſold for foure ſcore pence. And they that
ſo bought them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed thereon with ſuch ſweetneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
as if they had eaten the very daintieſt meate, that
could be bought for a greater price.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarche</hi> rehearſeth, that in a certaine warre King
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> made, an Aſſes head was likewiſe ſold in his
Campe for ſeuentie Drachmaes.</p>
            <p>But leaue we the Aſſes head in ſo great eſtéeme to be
eaten, as alſo the fleſh wherein the bones thereof are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
and ſpeake we of the laſt and chiefe benefite, which
we receiue by the head of the Aſſe, when it is cut off, and
the fleſh parted from it.</p>
            <p>What merueilous properties and vertue is included
in the ſaid Aſſes head, the poore huſbandman wel knows,
and great proofe is made thereof in many places of <hi>Italy,</hi>
as alſo diuers other territories beyond the mountaines.</p>
            <p>Hence enſues it, that in the other partes of the lande
about <hi>Breſcia,</hi> we ſée in many places, the heades of Aſſes
fixed on the ridge of walls and buildings: which in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the vulgare was, becauſe Goblins and dancing Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that runne in courſes, haue bene ſéene to plaie vp and
downe vpon them.</p>
            <p>The Lapidaries ſay, that there is a ſtone in the Aſſes
necke, called the Aſſe ſtone, which by the opinion of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
hath no ſmall vertue: and perhaps it may be the
ſame ſtone, which <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> calleth the ſtone <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> writes, that the liuer of an Aſſe eaten fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
helpes them that are afflicted with the falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The ſelfeſame power and vertue (ſaith he) hath the
Aſſes hoofe beaten into powder, and drunk in white wine.</p>
            <p>The dung of an Aſſe, wrapped in a linnen cloth, and
layd on his head that hath much blood abounding in his
noſe, doth withdraw it, and makes it perfectly ſound, as al
Authors that haue written in Phiſicke do affirme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4685:18"/>
               <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, that the drinking of an Aſſes milke, is the
chiefeſt remedie to helpe them that haue receiued poyſon.
Hereto we may ioyne, that it is a preſent remedie for the
ſwelling of the ioynts, as alſo it cures the gout.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, he addeth, that the ſame milke mingled
with a quantitie of honie, is a moſt admirable helpe for
them troubled with the Diſſenteria, eſpecially if it bee
drunke faſting.</p>
            <p>Finally, the vniuerſall Academie of Phiſitians doe
herein agrée, that the drinking of an Aſſes milke, cureth
many and ſundry infirmities, whereof my ſkill ſerues me
not to make report.</p>
            <p>But well I know, and thereof am able to yéeld a moſt
certaine teſtimony, that to an eſpeciall friend of mine, who
not long ſince was greatly gréeued with the ſtone, report
was made of the vertue of this milke, wherof he drinking
as the very lateſt remedie of hope, not only receiued the
moſt ſingular benefit of recouerie from the point of death,
which he ſawe him vnlikely to eſcape; but likewiſe attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his former health and good diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> reports, that <hi>Poppea</hi> wife to
<hi>Nero,</hi> euery morning vſed to waſh all her bodie with Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
milke: only to cheriſh and maintaine health, beautie
and ſoftneſſe, as alſo to make the bodie amiable and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
For this purpoſe ſhe had fiue hundreth Aſſes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
kept, and ſuch eſpecially as very lately before had
foled their yoong: which vſe, from that time to this preſent
day, hath bene obſerued by many of our greateſt Matrons,
and among all the reſt, by <hi>Ione</hi> that was the Quéen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſpeak ſome what concerning the vertue of this
beaſts ſkinne, do we not reade, that if it be taken and vſed
as a mantle, to wrappe about a childe while he is in the
Cradle, that it cauſeth the vertue of courage and boldneſſe
in ſuch ſort, as when he comes to yeares, he ſhall neuer
<pb facs="tcp:4685:19"/>
know the man to be affraide of?</p>
            <p>See we not likewiſe by daily experience, that ſuch as
ſléepe vppon an Aſſes ſkinne, or vſe it vppon them as
a couering, ſhalbe frée from vermine or Lice about them?</p>
            <p>Hereof procéeds it, that maiſters, maiſters mates, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
captaines and ſuch like, as ſerue eiſher in ſhippes
or gallies, haue ordinarily theſe ſkinnes about them.</p>
            <p>The forenamed vertue, quallitie and gift, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by our Poet, altogither enforced him to ſing in this
maner.</p>
            <q>
               <l>I will not ſtand to tell the long diſcourſe.</l>
               <l>Of Dioſcorides, Plinie, and the reſt:</l>
               <l>Whoſe skill in phiſicke ſprang from ſoundeſt ſence,</l>
               <l>Vrgde them to write great matters of this beaſt,</l>
               <l>Concerning medicine all of ſoueraigne might,</l>
               <l>Which for good cauſe I ſpare here to recite.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Yet will I not forbeare to rehearſe, that if we haue
ſuch conſideration, as ought be vſed about matter of great
profit, we ſhall receiue ſome by this ſkinne, when it is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
and made wih holes in many places, that it may
ſerue as Siue or Searſe, wherewith commodiouſly we
take vp corne, or whatſoeuer kind of pulſe beſide, to clenſe
it from the duſt and other matter of annoyance: we ſhall
then be enforced to confeſſe, that without the benefite of
this ſkin, very hardly could we deale in ſuch buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Hereto let vs adioyne another commoditie, which we
receiue by this ſkinne in the ſharpe aſſaults of warre, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof is made the Drums and Tamburines, with
other ſuch like inſtruments fit for the vſe of warre: which
being to ſuch proportion as they ſhould be, and ſmitten on
(as men are inſtructed in the manner how) they deliuer
ſuch an apt ſound, as awakes and cheares the minde of a
<pb facs="tcp:4685:19"/>
man, although he were neuer ſo cowardly or timorous,
prouoking him to the battaile, making him withall, fierce
and couragious, bee the aſſault neuer ſo hotte and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous.</p>
            <p>What ſhall wee then ſay of the Aſſes bones? Is it
not a thing eſpecially to be noted, that the marrow being
taken foorth, ſuch a kinde of Flute is of them, as yéeldes a
very ſweete and pleaſing harmonie?</p>
            <p>This was the cauſe which moued the Ambaſſadour of
the great Duke of <hi>Moſcouia,</hi> that went to <hi>Rome</hi> the laſt
yeare, to demaund whereof thoſe inſtruments that wee
call Cornets, which in honour of him (among other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
inſtruments) were ſounded when he entred his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
which the noble Gouernour of <hi>Verona</hi> had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for him. And being anſwered that they were of wood,
couered with this beaſtes ſkinne, he meruailed greatly
thereat. And albeit he graunted, that they gaue a moſte
pleaſing melodie, yet hée ſaide, they were not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to them made of Aſſes bones in his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>Then may we ſafely (on the Aſſes behalfe) affirme with
our Poet.</p>
            <q>Aliue and dead, in fleſh and bone he ſoundes.</q>
            <p>I am reſolued then to reade no further in what I haue
ſpoken of, concerning the quallitie, vertue and properties
of the Aſſe, and of his bones: becauſe if I would, it were
conuenient for me (according to our Poets opinion) prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
to recount.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4685:20"/>
we muſt néeds except, what may not wel be ſhadowed with
ſilence, becauſe it is little leſſe then miraculous, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
by <hi>Apuleius,</hi> in his booke of Country matters. If
any man bitten by a Scorpion, doth ſodeinly mount vppon
an Aſſe, ſitting with his face toward the Aſſes taile, all the
venome of the Scorpion which the man hath receiued, ſhal
part from him, and enter into the Aſſes bodie whereupon
he rydes, and the Aſſe ſhal preſently be ſéene ſwolne, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and complaining, as if he had bene bitten by the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion:
ſo that the man ſhalbe ſoundly recouered from any
peril of the poyſon. The proofe heereof, the before named
Author affirmeth, that by himſelfe it hath very often and
many times bene ſéene. If men then receiue ſuch a benefit
by the Aſſe, he that ſhould conceale it from being knowne,
I leaue to the iudgement of the Aſſe-fauouring Reader.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe let him be ſo cenſured, that ſpares to ſpeake,
what <hi>Plinie</hi> rehearſeth in his ſecond booke and twentieth
Chapter, that of the corruption in the Aſſes carcaſſe, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered
the blacke Flie called a béetle: which Flie, as is
ſaid in the thirtieth booke and ſecond Chapter, the people
of <hi>Egypt</hi> worſhipped as a God, perſwading themſelues,
that it was the very image of the Sun. And this was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
all the Béetles (as <hi>Elianus</hi> writes, and <hi>Snydas</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
confirmeth) are male-kinde, and haue no female a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them: in this maner then is their engendring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <p>The ſéed of the Oxe, Horſe, or dung of the Aſſe, ſpilt or
ſpred on the ground, which afterward they turne togither
with their féete, making therof the faſhion of a bed, and ſo
lye thereon, and circle it for twentie eight dayes togither,
when it receiueth forcible heate at the time for them to
take life, and thus appeares new engendred Béetles ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which are like to the Sun, becauſe he likewiſe ſpreads
on the earth his vertue ſeminall. Thus by his continuall
courſe are they encreaſed, flying vp toward heauen and the
<pb facs="tcp:4685:20"/>
heate of his beames, and as the Mooue reneweth euerie
moneth, ſo doth this kinde of Béetle ſtil renew.</p>
            <p>Now let vs ſpeake a little of the vertue which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
appertaineth to the hoofe of the Aſſe, according to <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi>
when it is boyled in Aſſes milke, and applied to weak
ſighted eyes, it helpes them greatly, taking all offence
whatſoeuer from them, and cleares the ſight moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarche</hi> writeth, in the life of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,
that the poyſon giuen him to drinke, was an excéeding cold
water, gathered from a certaine Rocke in the Countrey
of <hi>Nouaria,</hi> which cannot be kept but in an Aſſes hoofe: for
all other things are not able to hold it, but wil breake by
reaſon of the extreame coldneſſe.</p>
            <p>Such then, and ſo many are the ſtupendious actions,
notable graces, and ſupernaturall gifts or quallities of the
Aſſe, which can neuer be ſufficiently commended: as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he deſerueth to haue the chiefe place, amongſt all bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
beaſts liuing on the earth. By iuſt equitie whereof,
our Poet being intirely moued, thus ſingeth.</p>

               <l>If I would ſing his due deſerued praiſe,</l>

               <l>And giues to him the palme of following daies.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Hence is it, that wee néede make no great meruaile,
why the auncient Aſtrologers, mooued by his ſo many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
perfections, Nobleneſſe and excellencie, doo honour
him in heauen with the name of two ſtarres, placed in the
ſigne of <hi>Cancer,</hi> called <hi>Aſinelle,</hi> and in an other place they
ſet downe thrée, named <hi>Praeſepe Aſinelli,</hi> the Aſſes maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Nor can I but declare (as ſuccéeding in this place) the
great and diligent regard, which euermore the auncient
<pb facs="tcp:4685:21"/>
magnificent Lords had, to make (as one would ſay) the

leaue ſuch a memorie to poſteritie, as ſhall make the Aſſes

            <p>Hauing ſo lately mentioned the Citie of <hi>Modeua,</hi> I
call to minde a memorie concerning the Aſſe, which the
ſaid Citie long time kept among other things, with good
regard. And it was a milking paile, wherin a citizens Aſſe
of <hi>Bologna</hi> had drunke: for it happened, that about matter
of the confines, warres enſued betwéene them of <hi>Bologna</hi>
and <hi>Modeua.</hi> They of this part, at one time among other,
made a tumultuous inuaſion on the territories of <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and finding ſome encounter which they looked not
for, by reaſon of their vnorderly proceeding: they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to returne, yet they ſought for ſome bootie in the
ſtable of <hi>Bolognian</hi> Cittizen, from whence the maiſter
thereof had but lately before taken foorth his Aſſe, and for
feare eſcaped away thereon. There found they the milking
paile, wherin the Aſſe before ſpoken on had drunke, which
they tooke away with them, and mounting it on the point
of a Launce, after the maner of carrying ſome great Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phée,
they returned there with to the Cittie, all the people
of <hi>Modeua</hi> running to gaze theron, as at a moſt rich ſpoyle
gotten by conqueſt of warre: which by them long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was kept as an eſpeciall example: as we reade in
the booke called the <hi>Annales</hi> of <hi>Lombardie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But nowe returne wee to the other memories of

an Aſſe lying along verie formally, euen as the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures

are certaine letters engrauen at the féete of the ſaid Aſſe:
but nothing can be made of any ſillable, by reaſon they are
ſo defaced by antiquitie.</p>
            <p>Here I confeſſe, and that for ſome reuerence, which
dutifully I beare to the Aſſe, not to haue founde any other
<pb facs="tcp:4685:23"/>

            <p>And this lawe (for this purpoſe) do I account ſufficient,

            <p>2 <hi>Nouius Marcellus</hi> recordeth, that the Romanes of

the huſbands children only ſhould be preſent, each one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brauing

thrée times they would circle the temple about. Afterward
they ſhould caſt lottes, and his Aſſe to whome the lot fell,
muſt haue his throte cut; with whoſe blood each filling a
little glaſſe viall, they would ſtriue to maiſter one another
by throwing the ſame in the face of ſtatue, which repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the God of the gardein.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Herodotus</hi> a moſt auncient writer reports, that

<hi>Scarralaſino,</hi> to wit, vnlead the Aſſe: whereat, by imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>1 <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> declareth, that at ſuch time as the
Iſle of <hi>Scicile</hi> was gouerned by tyrants, there was a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
that a woman offending in adultrie ſhould frée her
ſelfe, ſwearing ſhe had not committed adulterie, being
brought before the head of an Aſſe, which for this purpoſe
<pb facs="tcp:4685:24"/>
was kept in the temple dedicated to God <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 There was an vſe among the Gentiles, that they (in
ieſt) willing to giue an oath to children, they would faſten
a lampe at their garment, with a haubercher after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of a long triangle, and holding thereby, ſay, Sweare
here vpon this eare of the Aſſe.</p>
            <p>Here it remaines to ſpeake of them, that of olde haue
bene named by the Aſſe, and of families likewiſe, which
haue called themſelues of the Aſſe. But becauſe they are
infinit, and all the ſkinnes in the land of <hi>Madiam</hi> cannot
containe them: I intend only to name two, as hitherto of
the reſt I haue done, leauing the endleſſe number of the
other, to them that liſt imploy their paines about ſuch a
buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>But yet among ſo many, I muſt not forget that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
nauall victory, which the auncient Perſians brought
with them out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and <hi>Noacles</hi> a moſte excellent
Painter in thoſe dayes, deſirous to remember the ſame
by his Arte, painted an Aſſe, drinking at the Riuer <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
in deſpight of the Crocadile: which being ouercome
in power, and thus ſubiected, ſtoode patiently to ſee him
drinke, as <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth.</p>
            <p>1 Then not to let paſſe in ſilence, the names of men
called Aſſe, as their proper names, I may firſt alleadge the
name of <hi>Asinius Gallus,</hi> who was ſonne to <hi>Scipio Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who deſires to know an infinite number of men,
both Senators &amp; of other diſcents, which by proper name
were called <hi>Asini,</hi> let him reade <hi>Ciceros</hi> Epiſtles to <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi>
where he ſhall finde an endleſſe beadrole.</p>
            <p>2 Here may I wel inſert the name of a famous man,
a moderne Cittizen of <hi>Florence,</hi> of the auncient family of
the <hi>Asini:</hi> to wit, maiſter <hi>Asino,</hi> whome the Hiſtorie of
<hi>Florence</hi> faithfully reports, to reforme and correct the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb facs="tcp:4685:25"/>
of the merchaunts, for which his Aſſe-gloring name
will for euer be renowmed in that Citie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pindarus,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> in the fift booke of his <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles</hi>
affirmeth, that the famous Gréeke, which made
the Horſſe of wood, by meanes whereof the Grecians
got the Citie of <hi>Troy,</hi> was called <hi>Aſinon:</hi> whereas <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill</hi>
naming him <hi>Sinon,</hi> we may ſafely auouth, that the
good Poet, who fauoured the <hi>Troyan</hi> part, from whence
the Romanes had their originall, was procured to alter
the name of the aforeſaid <hi>Aſinon:</hi> euen no otherwiſe then
the Grecians did, when by publike decrée he was cenſured
with baniſhment, that ſhould ſpeake of his name, who
to get himſelfe fame, ſet on fire the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at
<hi>Epheſus.</hi> And ſo to conquere with obliuion ſuch a famous
<hi>Aſinon,</hi> whoſe praiſe well deſerues to liue for euer: they
haue taken away his names firſt letter, and in ſtéed of <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
call him <hi>Sinon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 We haue alreadie declared, that in <hi>Florence</hi> liues
the noble Familie of the <hi>Aſini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 In <hi>Piſa</hi> likewiſe is there another, and in <hi>Bologna</hi>
that of the <hi>Aſinelli,</hi> where alſo is ſtil celebrate the famous
Tower, which the noble <hi>Aſinelli</hi> in elder times erected.
But to what end trouble I my wittes in this maner, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by the light of an Aſſe-friending lanthorn, for names,
ſirnames, and families? ſéeing our Poet himſelfe thus ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth.</p>
            <q>
               <l>If I ſhould ſpeake more matter of import,</l>
               <l>By grounded reaſon I might ſafely ſay,</l>
               <l>The Aſſe in men that are of learnedſt ſort,</l>
               <l>Seemes to haue priuiledge and greateſt ſway.</l>
               <l>Tis too well knowen, wherefore I ſilent ſit,</l>
               <l>As hauing thereof neither ſpoke or writ.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4685:25"/>
Beſide all this, I doo not meruaile a little, ſéeing ſuch
an infinit company of fooles, who being honoured with the
excelling name of Aſſe, will yet runne he adiong to brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and quarrell, when ſetling to their weapons, they
will flaſh and cut they care not with whom. All which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth,
by reaſon it is no common vſe, to apply the name
of ſo Noble a beaſt to man: who notwithſtanding cares
not for the ignomie, to bee tearmed after other wicked
beaſtes more vnbeſéeming, as to be called Beare, Lyon,
Dogge, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>This was the cauſe, that our Poet mooued by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
reaſons, ſaith;
<q>
                  <l>Nor know I wherefore choller doth ſo daunt,</l>
                  <l>A man when he is tearmed by the Aſſes name:</l>
                  <l>Whereof (me thinkes) much rather he ſhould vaunt.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now procéed we to ſpeake of the Aſſes Prouerbes.</p>
            <p>1 When a man will not repeate his wordes againe,
he vſeth to ſay, <hi>It is May no more, or May is paſt:</hi> ſo things
are auoyded from twiſe ſpeaking. The meaning here of
may be this, becauſe the firſt moneth that Aſſes doo make
knowne to the worlde, their louing nature to each other,
they ſend foorth their goodly, ſwéet, and continual brayings,
whereof they forme a melodious and proportionable kinde
of muſicke. Nor thinke I that any of our immoderne Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
can deny, but that their ſong is full of exceeding
pleaſure to be heard: becauſe therein is to bee diſcerned,
both concord, diſcord, ſinging the meane, the beginning
to ſing in large compaſſe, then following on, to riſe and
fall, the halfe note, whole note, muſicke of fiue voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
firme ſinging by foure voyces, thrée togither,
<pb facs="tcp:4685:26"/>
or one voyce and a halfe. Then their variable contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
amongſt them, when one deliuers foorth a long tenor
or a ſhort, the pauſing for time, breathing in meaſure, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the minim, halfe minim, or verie leaſt moment of
time. Laſt of all, to heare muſicke of fiue or ſixe voyces,
chaunged to ſo many of Aſſes, is amongſt them to heare a
ſong of world without end.</p>
            <p>Hence is it, that a man being ſo attentiue to heare this
kinde of Aſſe muſicke, cannot liſten or lende his eare to
what elſe is ſaid to him, and therefore it is lawfull, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
priulledge of the ſaid May moneth, to repeate the
words to ſuch, as without offence would learne them by
heart: nor ſhall it be taken ſo vnmanerly done, as it were
in any of the other moneths.</p>
            <p>2 When <hi>Apuleius</hi> ſawe himſelfe tranſformed into an
Aſſe, he reſolued to ſhewe his maiſter, by the effects of all
his perſonage, the great loue he bare him. So after the
maner of the houſe Dogge, kéeping his hinder féete on the
ground, and riſing vp with his former, he ſo clambred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his maiſter, as but a while before he had ſéene the litle
Dogge doo. And albeit his kinde Aſſehith intent he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
to his maiſter, yet ſuch maner of ſalutation in him
was not taken in good part. Hereof then it comes, that
when a man ſuſpects or miſdéemes of an others familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
he vſeth to ſay, <hi>He plaies the Aſſes paſtime with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So was it went to be ſaid; <hi>What the Aſſe giues in,
ſuch he receiues.</hi> But becauſe this Prouerbe is euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of it ſelfe, as if it were <hi>Omne agens repatitur in agendo:</hi> I
will beſtow no more paines in declaring it, nor yet of this
which followes.</p>
            <q>
               <l>What Aſſe or Hart will be ſo bold,</l>
               <l>To leape a pit ere he it behold?</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4685:26"/>
Nor likewiſe of this, to wit.</p>
            <q>Who waſheth an Aſſe head, looſeth his ſope.</q>
            <p>Nor will I ſtand trifeling the time, to know whence
many words are deriued, which in regard of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
are breathed foorth but by a letter, or as we ſay in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</p>
            <q>Quaestio de vmbra Aſini.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſinus ad liram,</hi> and ſuch like. This I ſay were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
then as one meaning to walke hande in hande
with a Phiſitian, ſhould ſodeinly breake his head: inough
is well.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the aforeſaid qualities and memorie
of the Aſſe, it is no great meruaile, that the auncient wiſe
men ſhould make ſuch a great account of the Aſſe, which in
like manner hath often made me to admire, conſidering,
that with all they could procure, to make the ſaid beaſtes
name immortall, by ſo many denominations as we haue
ſéene: neuertheleſſe, there is not founde any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
any Emperour or Prince, that cared to beare this
ſigne of the Aſſe, not painting him in their Scutchions, as
their proper Armes, not vſing him as an impreſe. The
reaſon hereof may be, that in prouing his déeds, they haue
left him to vs, who being of the Chriſtian name, ſhould
likewiſe ſhewe the ſame by déedes to the worlde: bearing
him for our proper Armes, becauſe we know the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,
méekneſſe, and other pleaſing qualities, wherewith
we haue ſéene the Aſſe to be richly endued.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thoſe auncient Common-weales, thoſe
Emperours and other Princes barbarous or Gentiles,
<pb facs="tcp:4685:27"/>
which builded their gouernement vppon rapine, vye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
deceipt, fraude, and all other tyrannicall beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
would haue their iron cuſtomes diſcerned, by the
Armes and impreſes of terrible, bloodie, and moſt cruell
beaſts.</p>
            <p>Heereof grewe it, that the moſte proude people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> tooke the Eagle for their Enſign and Armes, which
is a bird moſt rauenous and deuouring. But in reaſon
they ſhould rather haue made choyſe of the Gooſe, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
they preſerued their Countrey, libertie, and proper
liues: when the ſouldiers awaked by their noyſe, by the
means of the Géeſe; defended the Capital from the French
mens aſſault.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, the Gooſe was reputed
a bird too ſimple for them &amp; too vigilant: euen like eſtéeme
would they haue made of the Aſſe, if by his braying they
had receiued the ſelfeſame benefit.</p>
            <p>The people of <hi>Phrigia</hi> had for their Armes, the wilde
Bore, a moſt pernicious beaſt.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Thrace</hi> had a fleſhleſſe carkaſſe, or the image
of death as wee may tearme it, for the extreameſt of all
things terrible.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gothes</hi> beare a Feare, a moſt irefull beaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alani</hi> that aſſaulted and ſacked <hi>Spaine,</hi> had the
<hi>Marten,</hi> a very fraudfull beaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> heare the Lyon, a moſt proud beaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lumbardes</hi> ſerued themſelues with the Enſigne
of the Toade, a thing which both aliue and dead is poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> that were ouercome by <hi>Caius Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
they tooke the Bull, a beaſt hardly tamed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4685:27"/>
The <hi>Saxons</hi> made choyſe of the Horſſe, a goodly
beaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> beare the Scorpion in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
that carries his poyſon hidden ſecretly in his
tayle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caithagenians</hi> had the Crocadile for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſe,
a fraudelent beaſt and moſt deceitfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Attila,</hi> who cauſed himſelfe to be ſirnamed, the ſcourge
of God, had in his banner the Hawke, a fowle that liues
by rapine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antigonus,</hi> King of <hi>Soria,</hi> gaue the Eagle, that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held in her tallents a fierce Dragon.</p>
            <p>And laſt of all, not Common-weales onely and great
Princes, ſerue themſelues with theſe beaſtes, fierce, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
and venemous, but likewiſe families, and houſes of
priuate Gentlemen, yea, of ſimple Citizens, place in their
Scutchione the ſelfeſame ſignalles. Whereas if they had
chaunged ſuch cuſtomes, and embraced the true Chriſtian
faith, I am perſwaded it would likewiſe will in them,
to chaunge ſuch Armes and impreſes: and in ſtéed of thoſe
moſt rauenous deuourers, to place in their Banners
ſimple and houſholde beaſtes, ſhewing thereby to the
world Chriſtian ſimplicitie, friendlineſſe and loue, as by
the Gooſe, the Lambe, the Turtle Dooue, and ſuch like
harmeleſſe things.</p>
            <p>But beyond theſe, they ſhould ſhewe themſelues poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of all good and honourable cuſtome, if they would
take the Aſſe for their propper Armes, as that Noble
ſocietie of the Cittie of <hi>Vicenza</hi> hath done, who euer
hath helde in eſtéeme, and vniuerſally vſed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
of the noble Aſſe, whiche was taken from the
<pb facs="tcp:4685:28"/>
               <hi>Paduans</hi> in a controuerſie, and had long time bene hanged
vpon the gallowes: becauſe the ſaid Communitie of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi>
knew not ſo ſoone, that the people of <hi>Padua</hi> had han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vp the Aſſe, which they had ſent to couenaunt with
them, to giue them diuerſe burthens of entrailes, which
cloathed ouer and filled with hogges fleſh cut into ſmall
pieces, we call a Saulſage, which by the Aſſes voyce was
oft times ſpecified in them. But when <hi>Vicenzians</hi> had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
executed the ſame, the Saulſage was imparted
to the people of <hi>Padua,</hi> and the Aſſe taken downe from the
gallowes immediately: from whence enſued this ſong of
children, which euen vntil this day the youth of <hi>Padua</hi> vſe
to ſing, on the hanging of the ſaid Aſſe, to wit:
<q>
                  <l>Hangd, and vnhangd,</l>
                  <l>All for the piece of Saulſage.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In a certaine part of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> the name whereof I doo
not well remember, is yearly preſerued a memorie of the
Aſſe, well worthie truly to be rehearſed in this my Aſſe-defending
diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Thus then it is, vppon one certaine determinate day,
an infinite number of the people runne on heapes to the
market place, where from the toppe of a very high Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
he or they that is appointed for the office, make an Aſſe
to deſcend downe ſo queintly vpon certaine ropes, two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
wingges being faſtened to his ſhoulders, that in
diſcent he ſéemeth to flie: and the multitude are wont to
ſay after they haue dyned; Come, let vs goe into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
place, and ſée the Aſſe flie. Nor will I ſpare to ſay, that
ſome who holde a reuerend memorie of the Aſſe, gladly
could affoord, that the foreſaid Countrey was <hi>Empole</hi> in
<hi>Tuſcane:</hi> then I thinke they would imagine the better of
<pb facs="tcp:4685:28"/>
mine Aſſe diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Here I purpoſed to end my booke concerning the Aſſe,
had I not ſodeinly called to memorie, a matter worthie of
great conſideration, and to be preſerued in minde euen
to the end, for the compleate Nobleneſſe, excellencie and
perfection of the Aſſe.</p>
            <p>In the time of the Gentiles, there was a man borne
blinde by nature, euen at the laſt ſteppe of his age, and the
very finall moment of his life time. Among certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
offered to him, he was demaunded, what eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
thing more then any other he would deſire to ſée, if
<hi>Ioue,</hi> to whoſe reuerence he ſubmitted himſelfe, woulde
graunt, that he ſhould ſée that one thing and no more. To
which demaund, without ſtaying for any other premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he anſwered, an Aſſe. Which reply vrged in them
all an excéeding laughter, whereat the blinde man mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing;
ſaid; Brethren, make not a ieſt of what I deſire,
becauſe I imagine, that if any of you were in my caſe, you
ſcant would haue the like deſire. For ſince I came into
this world (which now fulfilles a great number of yéeres)
ther neuer paſſed one day, but that many hundred of times
I haue heard and knowne that beaſt to bee named, and
they applied him to all things whatſoeuer, that paſſed in
ſpéech or could be named.</p>
            <p>Forbeare to ſay, <hi>Beware the Aſſe, Make roome for the
Aſſe;</hi> we may well let theſe paſſe, becauſe I haue likewiſe
heard ſaid, Beware the Horſſe, beware the Mule, beware
the Oxe, and ſuch like. But here reſts the point, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
hearing this beaſt to be compared, to the likeneſſe of
mans bodie, to the vertue and vices of his minde; beſide,
giuing him many and ſundry preheminences and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
well worthie of no light conſideration. And to ſpeak

thus compared to a man, in regarde of ſuch and ſo many
quallities, but that in the reſt is ſéene quite contrary. Nor
can they elſe remaine in one ſubiect, no more then in fire
can be both heate and colde: but for proofe that they are

            </p>
            <p>In theſe and many other things, the Aſſe claimeth a
generall kindred.</p>
            <p>Among ſchollers in the Schoole making their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I haue heard them ſay; <hi>Homo eſt Aſinus, Brunellus
eſt Aſinus, ergo tues Aſinus.</hi> With ſo many diuers preche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences,
prerogatiues, vertues, viced, contrarieties and
denominations of the Aſſe, haue I ſo often heard, that my
minde hath bene encited with moſt earneſt deſire, to ſée
<pb facs="tcp:4685:30"/>
(ere I had ſéene) what beaſt this renowmed and famous
Aſſe was.</p>
            <p>Now then ſéeming to haue ſpoken ſufficiently, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelfe, that any man but meanely enſtructed in
Sciences ſpeculatiue, may in concluſion giue the ſentence
in fauour of the Aſſe: declaring him for the nobleſt of all
kindes of beaſts whatſoeuer remaining on the earth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
the Dogge, Horſe, Ape, Lyon, or Elephant.</p>
            <p>And as a knitting vp of my Aſſe-defending Treatiſe,
I commend my ſelfe to their conſideration, whom daily I
ſée to vſe ſuch Aſſe-like behauiour, that in all their actions
(I thinke) they intend to imitate the Aſſe. I would haue
them reſolue vpon inſtituting a company, which might be
tearmed the ſocietie or fellowwip of the Aſſe: and each of
them ſhould weare a tablet about his necke, whereon the
image of the Aſſe ſhuld be engrauen, to the end they might
the more apparently be knowne thereby.</p>
            <p>So taking my leaue both of you and the Aſſe, with this
one moſt honoured memorie of all concerning him; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Sauiour of the world, that in all his life time
had but one dayes tryumph, when hee refuſing all other
beaſts beſide, made choyſe onely of the Aſſe, and rode ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in greateſt maieſtie to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> yet néedes will our
Poet with theſe verſes knit vp this Treatiſe.</p>
