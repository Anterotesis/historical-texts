            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>Vpon the second agreement (the first being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
through iealousie of a disproportion of
eminencie) betweene the <hi>Triumuiri Octaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Caesar, Marcus Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus:
Octauia</hi> the sister of <hi>Octauius Caesar,</hi> was
married to <hi>Antonius,</hi> as a linke to combine that which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
yet, the greatest strength of nature, or anie power of
nearest respect could long holde togither, who made but the
instrument of others ends, and deliuered vp as an Ostage to
serue the oportunitie of aduantages, met not with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
she brought: but as highlie preferred to affliction
encountered with all the greeuances that beate vppon the
miserie of greatnes, exposed tost and betwixt the diuers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nding
humours of vnquiet parties. For <hi>Antonie</hi> hauing
yet vpon him the letters of AEgypt, layde on by the power
of a most incomparable beautie, could admit no new lawes
into the state of his affection, or dispose of himselfe being not
himselfe, but as hauing his heart turned Eastwarde whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the point of his desires were directed, touchte with the
strongest allurements that ambition, and a licencious so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraintie
could draw a man vnto: could not trulie descend
to the priuate loue of a ciuill nurtred Matrone, whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
bounded with modestie and the nature of her <pb facs="tcp:9795:136"/>education, knew not to cloth her affections in any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
then the plain habit of truth: wherein she euer suted alher
actions, and vsed all her best ornaments of honestie, to
win the good liking of him that helde her but as a Curtaine
drawne betweene him and <hi>Octauius</hi> to shadow his other
purposes withall; which the sharpe sight of an equallie ie alous
ambition could soone pierce into, and as easily looke
thorow and ouer bloud and nature as he to abuse it: And
therefore to preuent his aspiring, he armes his forces either
to reduce <hi>Antonic</hi> to the ranke of his estate, or else to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sranke
him out of state and al. When <hi>Octauia</hi> by the imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Antonie</hi> (as being not yet ready to put his fortune
to her triall) throwes her selfe, great with child, and as big
with sorrowe, into the trauaile of a most labour some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:
taking her iourney from the farthest part of
<hi>Greece</hi> to find <hi>Octauius,</hi> with whom her care and teares
were so good agents that they effected their commission
beyond all expectation: and for that time quite disarmed
their wrath, which yet long could not hold so. For <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
falling into the relaps of his former disease, watching
his oportunity got ouer againe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
himselfe, that he quite put off his own nature, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ely
became a pray to his pleasures, as if hee had wound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
out of the respect of Country, bloud and alltance, which
gaue to <hi>Octauia</hi> the cause of much affliction, and to me the
Argument of this letter.</p>

                  <head>THE ARGVMENT.</head>
                  <p>AFter the death of <hi>Antonius, Cleopatra</hi> (li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
still in the Monument she had caused
to bee built,) coulde not by anie meanes bee
drawne foorth, although <hi>Octauius Caesar</hi>
verie earnestlie laboured it: and sent <hi>Proculcius</hi> to vse
all diligence to bring her vnto him: For that he thought
it woulde bee a great Ornament to his tryumphes, to get
her aliue to Rome. But neuer woulde shee put her selfe
into the handes of <hi>Proculeius,</hi> although on a time hee
founde the meanes, (by a window that was at the toppe
of the Monument,) to come downe vnto her: where hee
perswaded her (all hee might) to yeelde her selfe to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
mercie. Which shee, (to bee ridde of him,) cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
seemed to graunt vnto. After that, <hi>Octauius</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
went to visite her, to whome shee excused her offence, <pb facs="tcp:9795:150"/>laying all the fault vpon the greatnesse, and feare shee had
of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and withall, seemed verie tractable, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be disposed of by him.</p>
                  <p>VVhereupon <hi>Octauius,</hi> (thinking himselfe sure) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solu'd
presentlie to sende her away to Rome. Whereof, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labella</hi>
a fauourite of <hi>Caesars,</hi> (and one that was growne
into some good liking of her,) hauing certified her, shee
makes her humble petition to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that hee would suffer
her to sacrifice to the ghost of <hi>Antonius:</hi> which beeing
graunted her, shee was brought vnto his Sepulcher, where
after her rytes perfourmed, she returned to the Monument,
and there dined with great magnificence. And in dinner
time, came there one in the habite of a Countrey-man,
with a Basket of Figges vnto her who (vnsuspected) was
suffered to carrie them in. And in that Basket (among
the Figges) were conueyed the Aspicks wherewith she did
herselfe to death. Dinner beeing ended, shee dispatched
Letters to <hi>Caesar,</hi> contayning great lamentations: with
an earnest supplication, that she might bee intomb'd with
<hi>Antonius.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> knowing what shee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
sent presentlie with all speede, Messengers to haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
her death, which not withstanding, before they came
was dispatched.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesario</hi> her sonne, which she had by <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi>
(conuaied before vnto <hi>India,</hi> out of the daunger of the
warres,) was about the same time of her death, murthered <pb facs="tcp:9795:150"/>at <hi>Rhodes:</hi> trayned thither by the falshoode of his Tutor,
corrupted by <hi>Caesar.</hi> And so hereby, came the race of the
<hi>Ptolomies</hi> to bee wholie extinct, and the flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
rich kingdome of <hi>Egypt</hi> vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ouer-throwne and
subdued.</p>
