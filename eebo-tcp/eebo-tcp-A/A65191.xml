            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Sir Henry Vane his Speech.</head>
            <p>MY Lord Major, and worthy Aldermen, and
the rest of the Gentlemen of the Citie, In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the Commands of <hi>both Houses,</hi> we
that are lately come out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and have been
eye witnesses (from the first time of our going over
thither) of the affection of that Nation to this cause
and of the deep sence they have of the present state
of Affaires here in this Kingdome, are willing at this
time to make the same report, and give the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
to you of it, as hath been done to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that you may take a right measure of the
trueth of those things, and not be caried away with
misapprehensions, and misinformations from those
that disaffect the cause, and would willingly abuse
your thoughts, and beleife herein; and therefore as
shortly as I am able, I shall be willing to give you the
accompt of those things which I know, and which I
have seen there, and which this other Gentleman, a
<hi>rever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Minister,</hi> of your owne acquaintance, and of
<hi>knowne integritie,</hi> hath been privie to, that I doe not
doubt, what he likewise shall deliver in this businesse
you will very readily give credit too, it being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what will be found to be the trueth.</p>
            <p>For the affection of that Nation, we have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
experiences of it, and of their readie and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
compliance with the desires of this Kingdome, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
when they were in their greatest distresses and
calamities: When we first came over there, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
then of this Nation, were in a much lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
then now (by the blessing of God) we find
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53861:3"/>
them to be; yet notwithstanding though that Nation
had many invitations from those, who as they were
forward to promise, so were they able to have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
great matters vpon them, and though there were
many secret practises among themselves to make
them set loose from the cause of this Kingdome, yet
so sensible they were, of the danger of Religion here
of the near relation that they had to their breethren
of <hi>England,</hi> and of that common calamitie threatned
to overrun both Kingdomes, that they were readie
to breake through all difficulties, and to expose
themselves to all dangers, to take us by the hand,
and to joyne cordially with us in the maintaining of
this cause; they did not only expresse this in their
words, and outward professions, but we have seen
since from time to time, and by severall steps, how
they have put it into Action: As soone as ever the
the <hi>Covenant</hi> which was taken here, and solemnly
sworne by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> was come to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and sent over unto them, the <hi>Committee</hi> of
<hi>Estates</hi> there, and the <hi>Commissioners</hi> of the <hi>Genreall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi>
resolved presently for to take that <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
with an vnanimous and chearefull consent, as a
meanes which under God, they thought would vnite
both Nations, in this common cause, and make them
a bulwarke against the <hi>Common Enemie:</hi> They did not
only resolve to take it themselves, but enjoyned it
throughout the whole Kinghome, and by this time
we doe beleive, that it hath been vniversally taken
by the whole Nation. They did enjoyne it in such
a manner, as that the greatest and powerfullest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of it amongst them durst not shew their heads to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53861:3"/>
oppose it, that is, they enjoyned it upon the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that those that should not take it, or should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it, should be esteemed Enemies to Religion, to
his <hi>Majesties</hi> honour, and to the good of the two
Kingdomes, that they should have all their Rents
and profits confiscate, that they should brooke, nor
enjoy any Office, or benefit in that Kingdome, that
they should be cited to the next <hi>Parliament,</hi> to answer
the not taking of it, and to be proceeded with there
as enemies to the <hi>Estate,</hi> and to <hi>Relegion,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such further punishement, as by the King and
Parliament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>uld be put upon them, by which
meanes they have so vnited the affection of that
whole Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as one man they are readie
to come forth to defend the Religion, the Liberties
of both Nations, and to dye in this Common Cause.
They have not only proceeded thus farre, which is a
happy Foundation to so great an enterprize as is now
in hand, but they have formed their Armie, all their
Officers from first to last they have setled, they have
likewise prepared their Artillerie, and have it in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
at the Rendevouze at <hi>Leith:</hi> They likewise
have all the men that are to be of the Armie designed
out throughout the whole Shires, the persons are
knowne, and at 48. houres, they are ready for to
march, they are as sensible as your selves of the great
burthens and extremities that this Nation doth at
this time groan under: They know as well too, what
vast expenses you have been at to maintaine your
owne Armies, and yet they are not ashamed, that
you should know also that their Nation hath not
been without troubles, as you have been, and that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53861:4"/>
they are not yet without great wants and difficulties,
for this storme did begin with them: They have
not been without great charges and burthens that
hath layen vpon them and particularly even for the
advantage of the affaires of this Kingdome, of
late they have been at very vast expenses for the
maintenance of their <hi>Scotch</hi> Armie in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which
was set out by them for the service of this Kingdom
at the request and desire of the Parliament, by which
meanes they are very much disinabled to doe that,
which otherwise they would be very willing to doe
for our present assistance.</p>
            <p>They have made it apparent by severall particulars,
that before this Armie intended for the present ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
wilbe brought to the Rendevouze upon English
ground, one way or other, it will stand them in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neare a hundred thousand pound, which must be
at their owne charge and expence, over and above
what they desire from us: They likewise have let
us know, that they desire not to presse vs beyond
our strength in matter of monies, but only so much
as may render the service in them feasible which we
expect from them: They know very well if they
have not monies at the beginning, to encourage and
strenghen the hand of the Souldier, in the businesse
they undertake, it wil be very disadvantagious to our
affaires, therefore they expect we should send them
a considerable summe of monie, to make their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
march, which they have in readinesse for that
purpose, as soone as we shall send it to them, and
doubt not in a very short time to advance very farre
in those Northern parts even this winter, it is that
therefore which is expected from us, and that which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53861:4"/>
will (through Gods mercy) be a Foundation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife
and recoverie of this Kingdome, from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and tyranny with which it is ready to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed,
that we should apply our selves to send
them some considerable summe of mony, for a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
marching of this Armie.</p>
            <p>Upon our comming hither, we find there hath
beene a great deale of paines taken in it. And we
likewise discerne that much is to be atributed to the
cheerefull affections of this famous City, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God hath been the meanes that hath not only
supplied our affaires at home, but hath likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to those that are abroad; not-with-standing
that which hath hither-to come in, is not as yet so
much as will fully doe this worke; if we could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
some few daies be able but to Compasse one twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Thousand Pound more? we doe not doubt but we
should be able (with what we have already) to put the
affaires of <hi>Scotland</hi> in such a Posture, as you shall not
only quickly heare a very good account of them, but
see the fruit of them, to your greate Comfort and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>And therfore it is that, that now is recommended
to you, that you would be pleased from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that things are in this readinesse that they are,
and that <hi>Nation</hi> so willing in themselves to come to
our assistance (as this I might have added) that if any
thing lay in their power, either by the morgaging of
their owne private <hi>Estates,</hi> or if there were Money
sufficient in <hi>Scotland</hi> that they could render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of, they would be willng to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
any thing of their owne for the necessities of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53861:5"/>
this Kingdome, so much they are affected with this
cause: Therfore seeing they are so sensible them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of our Condition, it becomes us to be so too,
and to put to our helping hand that since so small a
summe as this (for the present) is that that will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(through Gods blessing) to carry on this worke,
that we may with cheerefulnes apply our selves to
the compassing of the same: Those that have been
willing hitherto, we are to acknowledg thankes to
them, and the Houses have thought of an Ordinacce
that the burthen shall not lie upon them, but those
that are unwilling and disaffected, are by that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
compell'd to that which others out of their
good affections are ready to doe; so as it is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to you, that since the Houses have thought
fit by an Ordinance to compell others to doe it, that
those that are willing would take an incouragement
from thence, and goe on readily in their contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to this worke, that if it were possible we might
be masters of this summe within few dayes; it is that
which upon this occasion is thought fit to be offered
to you: And because there is an other Gentleman
to speake, Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> who what ever I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
wilbe able to make vp, whose words I doubt not,
but will take farre deeper impression with you, and
all of greater weight then any thing I can say, and I
shall give place to him to impart unto you what he
shall thinke fit and esteeme worthy of your farther
knowledge.</p>

and ought to have done) how that they have laid
out a very great summe. I adde, they have made it
apparant to us, that they have expended in Meale,
Clothes, and other Necessaries, no lesse then foure
score Thousand pounds this last yeere, toward the
subsistance of that Army, which else had perish't
before this time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, that in that part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
where we were, about <hi>Lowthian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that there
was scarce any on Nobleman or Gentleman of any
considerable estate, but hee was this last yeere out
of Purse one full yeeres Revenue, as if hee were
worth 100, 200, or 300. <hi>pound, Sterl. per Annum,</hi> hee
hath disburst so much for the <hi>Irish</hi> Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53861:6"/>
And as to that which Sir <hi>Henry</hi> declared as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of their willingnesse to Assist us, that
they have already charged themselves to the value
of 100000. <hi>pound.</hi> I adde, they have beene so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
and cleere in it, that they have given us a
particular to bring with us, which is in the hand of
this Noble Gentleman: So that any Man who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to be satisfied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may see the particulars of the
charge which they are put to, but to bring their
Army upon <hi>English</hi> Ground; and indeed, they so
cleerely see the bleeding condition of Religion
and Libertie in both Kingdomes, and are so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of our great exhaustions, that I have heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their worthy Nobles and others, whom God
hath stirr'd up to bee Active and Excellent Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this time of Common danger and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
solemnly to protest; That were they able to
come in, and carry on the worke without putting
us to any charge at all, they would do it most glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
yea, I am able yet further to say, and have leave
to speake it freely, that if money can be found in
<hi>Christendome,</hi> to carry on this work, they are ready
not onely to engage the Publike Faith of their
Kingdome with ours, (as you have already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
But that if either the Bonds or the Mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Lands of any of the well-affected Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Gentry throughout that Kingdome, will bee
taken for security, they are ready to give it; yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet, so deepely are they affected, that they are
willing (I had allmost said) to Plunder their owne
Kingdome to save ours; being ready, if necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, to call throughout all the Kingdome, each
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53861:7"/>
Man to declare upon his Oath, what Money, or
Victuall he hath; that they may therby know what
proportion to set out for the maintenance of this
Cause. And lest any suspitions, or Malignant Men
should surmise, that all this forwardnesse is but to
get themselves into some strength in a Countrey,
better then their owne, I beseech you know, that
the Honourable <hi>Commissioners,</hi> my self, and others,
who have beene attending this Service with them,
have received that abundant satisfaction of their
integrity and Justice, that what Articles are, or
shall be agreed upon betweene them, and the two
Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> wee verily believe they will
not breake one Article of the Agreement, to gain
the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi> Their affections to this
Cause are as your hearts could wish: it is onely
necessity compels them to desire your assistance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the maintenance of their Army when they
are come in; For should they come in, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
faile them, so that for want of Provision (for
you will easily conceive that the Northerne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
may bee much wasted by the Enemie when
they are readie to come) they should be compelled
to disband, or turne to plunder the Countries for
want of subsistance, how scandalous, yea how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
it might prove to both the Kingdomes
you your selves are able to judge.</p>
            <p>They are ready and prepared to come, and I
hope it will not bee long before you heare that
they are advanced, willing to live and dye with
you in this cause of God, and will endevour (by
Gods assistance) speedily to settle our peace; and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53861:7"/>
as willingly (according to their agreement) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
home into their owne Scotland, knowing
well, that to enjoy peace with God in their owne
poore countrey, will be better, then under colour
of helping us to usurpe upon ours, though far the
richer.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> related further unto you, what
care they have taken, and how roundly they goe
to work in putting on the COVENANT, give
me leave to adde, that (beside what the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of the Convention of Estates have done, in
injoyning it under paine of being esteemed and
punished as enemies to Religion, his Majesties ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and peace of the Kingdomes, and to have
their Goods confiscate for the use of the publike,
&amp;c.) the Commissioners of the Generall Assembly,
according to the power given unto them by the
said Assembly, have ordained, That particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
shall be taken by the severall Presbyteries,
of all who shall refuse, or shift to sweare and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
and that they bee proceeded against with
the censures of the Church, as enemies to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
and propagation of Religion.</p>
            <p>Beside, what this noble Gentleman hath further
related concerning their temptations or allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to desist from this worke, and the other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
they are like to meet with in carrying it
on, I have nothing to adde, unlesse I should tell
you how deeply they are affected with the Cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Ireland, and the great danger threatned to
both Nations from it; and the utter ruine of the
remainder of our poore Brethren yet preserved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53861:8"/>
from slaughter in that miserable Kingdome: For
by this Cessation, they, and all others see, that these
bloody Rebells, who have shed so much innocent
blood, who boast that they have slaughtered
100000 Protestants, and that they will not leave
one Protestant alive in that and this, Kingdome,
and who have committed the most out ragious and
most barbarous cruelties that have ever beene
heard of in Christendome, are now (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all this) without any either repentance or
submission, acknowledged to be his Majesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and have leave to keepe and hold what they
have; to enjoy free passage, intercourse, commerce,
and trafficke, with all other his Majesties good
subjects by sea and land, and no interruption to be
made to any ships which shall furnish them with
Armes, Ammunition, or any thing whatsoever;
their prisoners released, and such as are indicted
for any capitall offence to be set at liberty upon
baile; they may send to his Majesty such Agents as
they please; yea they have authority to prosecute
all in that Kingdom who shall stand in opposition
to this agreement, and all this to last for a whole
yeare: in which time, our Brethren in Scotland
easily discerne how these inhumane and bloody
wretches, may from all other Popish Kingdomes
be furnisht, both to root out the remainder of our
distressed Brethren of that Nation, and enabled to
come over and exercise the like butcheries upon
our selves and them. In a word, they looke upon
it as the most cleare stating of the Question and
intention of these warres, to be betwixt Papists
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53861:8"/>
and Protestants: And againe, I say they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
extreme danger from this cessation to both
these Nations, unlesse some speedy supply be sent
over to enable the Scottish army there to give
checke to their proceedings, upon whom they
will be ready to fall as a Torrent; and when once
they have devoured them (which God forbid) we
may be sure they will endeavour the like against
our selves.</p>
            <p>In all these our troubles hitherto, our greatest
supplies have been drawne, or rather flowed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
from this Honourable City, and it troubles
mee to thinke that I should bee force to use any
Rhetorick (if I had it) to draw more disbursements
of money from you, who to the admiration of all
this part of the Christian world have (under God)
upheld this great cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (I know) are resolved
to live and dye with it: I onely beseech you to
consider, that if timely supplies may be found, this
crop that hath beene swept off from us, will grow
againe with greater abundance, and wee may yet
sit every one under our owne Vine, and under our
owne Fig-tree; and, which is much sweeter, enjoy
the fruit and benefit of the Gospel of Iesus Christ,
which now we contend for, and which these wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
instruments would deprive us of. But if God
for our sins should deliver us into the hands of
those that have thus desperately plotted our ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
I thinke none of you would desire to swim
when this cause should sinke; or be vvilling to have
either gold, silver, or plate, or any thing found in
your houses, vvhen they should come to be possest
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53861:9"/>
by these men, vvhose tender mercies would bee
more bitter then bloudy cruelties. I beseech you
therefore consider of these motions vvhich have
been made unto you, and accept of this unfained
Relation, which we are able to call God to vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is nothing but the truth. And for my owne
part, I did see more, and doe beleeve more, and
my heart hath much more satisfaction concerning
the integrity of that Nation, their fellow-feeling
of our miseries, and their willingnesse to helpe us,
then my tongue is able to utter. This is the sum
of vvhat I had to say, the Lord direct you in vvhat
you are to doe.</p>
