         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE deſign of publiſhing theſe <hi>Treatiſes,</hi> is to vindicate the Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of our Laws from the rude aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which have been lately caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by ſuch who are better ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Hollinſhead</hi> and Stow, than in the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Occaſions of thoſe Laws. This is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent method of dealing with our Church and Laws, when our Adverſaries have been quite tired with ſcolding, they betake themſelves to throw dirt in the face of them; and I am ſorry the weakneſs or imprudence of any late <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> among us ſhould furniſh them with dunghils for this purpoſe. But ſince we have to deal with ſuch who have no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but what the weakneſs and miſtakes of their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> give them, it were heartily to be wiſhed, that ſome effectual courſe were taken, that the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> might be delivered to Poſterity with greater care and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity than hath yet been uſed about it.</p>
            <p>It hath been thought the wiſdom of ſome of the
<pb facs="tcp:62848:3"/>
beſt governed Nations in the World, to take a great care of their <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> by whom and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they were written. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That none but the High-Prieſts and the Prophets were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write the Hiſtories of the Jewiſh Nation;</hi> the like others ſay of the <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> who all looked upon the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of their <hi>Country</hi> as a <hi>Sacred</hi> thing, and which none ought to preſume to meddle with, but ſuch as were appointed for it, and whoſe imployment was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to free them from the ſuſpicion of flattery or falſhood. But above all Nations, the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> as they were moſt remarkable for Political Wiſdom, were the moſt punctual in this matter; no man durſt attempt any thing of Hiſtory among them beſides him whoſe publick Office it was, which he was bound to perform with all fidelity, for his won time; but not to call in queſtion, or correct any thing before him; by which means, the Hiſtory of that mighty Empire, though written by multitudes of Authors, is one continued and entire Story without any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety or contradiction. It is very well known, that the old <hi>Romans</hi> ſuffered none but the <hi>Pontifex Maximus</hi> to make up the <hi>Annals</hi> of every Year; which himſelf was only intruſted with the keeping of, that the People might, upon reſort to his houſe, have full ſatisfaction in all their doubts; and theſe were called the <hi>Annales Maximi;</hi> and although ſome make this cuſtom as old as the foundation of that Government, yet <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> more probably makes it to be one of the wiſe Conſtitutions of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. Dion</hi> ſaith, <hi>That while the Roman Senate continued its Authory, the Actions of every year</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62848:3"/>
               <hi>were ſolemnly read out of the Publick Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to the Senate and People; and although particular perſons would write Hiſtories according to their own inclinations, yet the Truth might be diſcerned out of the Publick Records:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he very much laments the uncertainty of their Hiſtories afterwards, when the <hi>Emperours</hi> would not endure the Truth to be written; yet there were perſons who would write, though they died for it, which was the caſe of <hi>Cremutius Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> and <hi>Titus Labienus;</hi> which made <hi>Seneca</hi> ſay, <hi>Res nova &amp; inſueta, ſupplicia de ſtudiis ſumi:</hi> but it ſeems by what follows in him, the World may bear the loſs of ſuch Writings; for, rejoycing that this <hi>Perſecution</hi> of <hi>Wits</hi> began after <hi>Cicero's</hi> time, he ſaith, <hi>Dii melius, quòd eo ſeculo iſta ingenio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſupplicia coepèrunt, quo ingenia deſiêrunt.</hi> And it appears by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that the cuſtom of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Annals</hi> was preſerved to his time for the greater Affairs, and the <hi>Diurna Acta Urbis</hi> for leſſer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences: and <hi>Tertullian</hi> frequently appeals to the <hi>Archives</hi> and <hi>Publick Commentaries.</hi> Which cuſtom of preſerving publick <hi>Records</hi> of Hiſtory, did likewiſe obtain in moſt well-governed Cities; as <hi>Plutarch</hi> often quotes the <hi>Delphick</hi> and <hi>Laconick Commentaries.</hi> Theſe things I only mention, that it may not be thought below the wiſdom of a Nation to take care of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of it; and not to ſuffer it to be profaned or corrupted, by every mean, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, or indiſcreet Writer, that hath ſo little wit and judgment, as to think himſelf fit to write the Hiſtory, either of his own or former times. None are fit for ſuch a work but perſons of great judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:62848:4"/>
and capacity, and ſuch who have had the beſt portunities of underſtanding Affairs, and have the greateſt reputation for integrity to report them. And we want not ſome ſuch as theſe, who are ſo well known, that I need not name them, but they are but few in compariſon with others. It was complained of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans,</hi> that L. <hi>Octacilius</hi> being but a <hi>Libertine,</hi> though he were <hi>Pompey's</hi> Maſter, ſhould preſume to write a Hiſtory, that being a Work pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the wiſeſt Senators; and Learned men have long wiſhed for a perpetual <hi>Edict</hi> againſt ſcribbling Hiſtorians, as great debauchers of Truth, and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters of the Faith of Hiſtory. I wiſh it were as eaſie to remedy as to complain of theſe things; but thoſe of us who are concerned for the Honour of our Church and Nation, find the continual and growing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of this miſchief; when we ſee all the falſe or indiſcreet paſſages of the worſt Hiſtorians picked up, and upon all occaſions made uſe of as the beſt Weapons againſt our Church. But thanks be to God, things are not yet ſo bad with us, but we have ſufficient evidence left to clear our ſelves of theſe reproaches, without being put to defend the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of every triſling Hiſtorian. What if <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſhead,</hi> or <hi>Stow,</hi> or <hi>Speed,</hi> or any later men have let fall ſome paſſages, which the Enemies of our Church make uſe of to its diſadvantage? Muſt things preſently be concluded to be juſt as ſuch men have ſaid, without ſearching farther? Muſt we be judged by them, rather than by ſuch who were in the top of buſineſs, and knew all the firſt grounds and Reaſons of Things? rather than by thoſe, who were as much concerned to have found out all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
<pb facs="tcp:62848:4"/>
againſt our Penal Laws; and yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to have had ſuch Reaſons for them, that no Government in the World, but upon the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, would have done the ſame things? This is that particular part of our Hiſtory, which I have endeavoured to clear by theſe following Treatiſes, which have theſe advantages to recommend them to the Readers Conſideration,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the firſt of them was penned by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of one of the Greateſt Stateſmen of his Age, and one of the Wiſeſt Perſons this Nation hath ever bred, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lord Treaſurer Burleigh.</hi> For when the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and their Party had filled the <hi>Courts</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> with their noiſe and clamours of the dreadful Perſecutions in <hi>England,</hi> that Great man thought it not below him to write this <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> here, and to ſhew how reaſonable, juſt, and moderate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the State were, conſidering the height and inſolence of the provocations; and this was publiſhed in ſeveral Languages, and diſperſed in the Courts of Princes to undeceive them as to all the falſe reports of the Romiſh Emiſſaries, who have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon them that publick Character of the Popes Ambaſſadors to <hi>lye abroad</hi> for his and their own advantage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But after that by the means of <hi>Cardinal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and others, they had endeavoured to blaſt the reputation of that <hi>Apology;</hi> and after the death of that great <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Secular Prieſts</hi> did publiſh their <hi>Important Conſiderations,</hi> wherein they aſſert the Truth of what was ſaid in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, and vindicate the Honour and Juſtice of the
<pb facs="tcp:62848:5"/>
Penal Laws: which is the ſecond Treatiſe here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and printed according to their own Copy; and which hath been ſo much concealed, or bought up by thoſe of that Religion, that it hath been heard of by ſew, and ſeen by fewer Proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And leſt any ſhould ſay, that all thoſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Principles to Government are ſince his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties happy Reſtauration utterly diſowned by them, I have added a third Treatiſe, printed by one of their own Religion 1662. which charges the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Party ſo deep with thoſe Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices as to make them uncapable of any Favour.</p>
            <p>If other perſons will purſue the ſame method in retrieving ſuch conſiderable <hi>Treatiſes</hi> as theſe are, they may do more ſervice to our Church and Nation than by writing Hiſtories themſelves; and I ſhall deſire the late <hi>Apologiſt</hi> to ſet theſe <hi>Authors</hi> of his own <hi>Church,</hi> againſt the petty <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> he ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually quotes on all occaſions: And we have ſo much the more reaſon to conſider theſe things, ſince in a very late <hi>Treatiſe</hi> called the <hi>Bleeding Iphige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion</hi> is defended by one of the Titular Biſhops to be a juſt and holy War; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſtill think it lawful, what can we imagine then that they want, but another occaſion to do the ſame things?</p>

(which is to be noted) were ſuch, as had never by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, or by Confirmation, profeſſed, nor were ever taught or inſtructed, or ever had heard of any other kind of Religion, but only of that which by their blood and death in the fire they did as true Martyrs teſtifie. A matter of another ſort to be lamented with ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of words, and not with puffed Eloquence, than the execution in this time of a very few Traytors, who alſo in their time, if they exceeded thirty years of Age, had in their Baptiſm profeſſed, and in their youth had learned the ſame Religion, which they now ſo bitterly oppugned. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that, in their opinions they differ much from the Martyrs of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time: for though they continued in the profeſſion of the Religion wherein they were Chriſtened, yet they never at their death denied their lawful Queen, nor main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any of her open and Foreign Enemies, nor procured any Rebellion or Civil War, nor did ſow any Sedition in ſecret Corners, nor withdrew any Subjects from their Obedience, as theſe ſworn Servants of the <hi>Pope</hi> have continually done.</p>

As ſimple Prieſts as you eſteem us, yet this we tell you, that we are not ignorant of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavilian</hi> Rules, which your Rabbies practiſe: nor of their Wild-geeſe Races, wherein they have run themſelves out of all honeſt breath. But we know them, not to embrace them (we thank God) but to diſcloſe them, or rather to acknowledge them for wicked (being diſcloſed too apparently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to our hands:) that you in time might eſchew them, (if you will be adviſed by us) and all the World at the length may bear us witneſs, how much we deteſt them from our hearts, and abhor them. Whilſt we had any hope, that theſe Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Fathers (as they joy to be termed) would at the laſt have reclaimed themſelves, and grown more tractable and moderate in their deſignments againſt our <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>Native Country:</hi> we were ſilent in reſpect of the common Cauſe, and very well content to undergo many inconveniences and miſeries, which we might have avoided (as we are perſwaded) if we had ſooner opened our ſelves, and profeſſed our ſaid deteſtation of ſuch their, no way Prieſtly, but very irreligious courſes: whereby the <hi>State</hi> hath been moſt juſtly irritated and provoked againſt us. For when we conſider on the one ſide, what we know our ſelves, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Laws made of later years, with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them, and likewiſe as touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>State</hi> here, ſince the beginning of her Majeſties Reign, as well againſt us that are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62848:31"/>
Prieſts, as alſo againſt other Catholicks of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and do find on the other ſide, what practices, under the pretence of Religion, have been ſet on foot, for the utter ſubverſion both of the <hi>Queen</hi> and of her Kingdom: and therewith further call to mind, what ſundry Jeſuits and men (wholly for the time or altogether) addicted to Jeſuitiſm, have written and publiſhed to the World in ſundry Treatiſes, not only againſt the ſaid Laws and courſe of Juſtice, but in like ſort againſt her chief Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, (and which exceedeth all the reſt) againſt the Royal perſon of her Majeſty, her Honour, Crown, and moſt Princely Scepter: it may in our opinions be rather wondred, that ſo many Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of both ſorts, are left alive in the Realm to ſpeak of the Catholick Faith, than that the <hi>State</hi> hath proceeded with us from time to time, as it hath done. It may ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that theſe things ſhould proceed from us that are Prieſts: but divers of you can bear us witneſs, that they are no new conceits, bred in us, by reaſon of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have with the Jeſuits: and beſides, no ſmall number of Catholicks (as we are perſwaded) have long expected this duty at your hands: that thereby our Allegiance and Fidelity to our <hi>Queen</hi> and Country might be the better teſtified, the hard opinion of us mitigated, our actions and profeſſion of duty better credited: the cauſe we ſtand for, more regarded: and we our ſelves (for our plain dealing, and for the good of the Church) might be the better reputed of, and eſteemed, or at the leaſt in ſome ſort born with and tolerated, as men that do diſtinguiſh between Religion and Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62848:31"/>We wiſh with all our hearts, (and groan every day at the contrary) that her Majeſty had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her obedience to the <hi>See Apoſtolick,</hi> as Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her Siſter of famous memory, had left her a worthy Example: but ſeeing that God for our ſins would have it otherwiſe, we ought to have carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves in another manner of courſe towards her, our true and lawful <hi>Queen,</hi> and towards our Country, than hath been taken and purſued by many Catholicks, but eſpecially by the Jeſuits. And therefore (as well to diſcharge our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as to ſatisfie many of you of the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of Catholicks, according to the old ſaying, Better late than never) we have thought it our parts, (being her Highneſs natural born Subjects) to acknowledge the truth of the carriage of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt us, and the apparent cauſes of it: that the blame may indeed, from point to point, light and lie where it ought to do, and both ſides bear no other than their own burthens, as the Laws both of God and man do require. If hereby her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may in any ſort be appeaſed, and the <hi>State</hi> ſatisfied, our own former courſes bettered, and the Realm ſecured, that the like ſhall never hereafter be attempted or favoured by any of us, but be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, if we know them, and withſtood, if they be enterpriſed, with all our goods and our lives, even to our uttermoſt ability, be their pretences never ſo fair, for Religion, or what elſe can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed: we ſhall think our ſelves happy, and will not regard what all the malice and ſpite of the Jeſuits can work or effect againſt us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62848:32"/>It cannot be denied, but that for the firſt ten years of her Majeſties Reign, the ſtate of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in <hi>England</hi> was tolerable, and after a ſort in ſome good quietneſs. Such as for their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were impriſoned in the beginning of her coming to the Crown, were very kindly and mercifully uſed, the ſtate of things then conſidered. Some of them were appointed to remain with ſuch their friends, as they themſelves made choice of. Others were placed, ſome with Biſhops; ſome with Deans; and had their diet at their Tables, with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Lodgings and Walks for their recreation, as did well content them. They that were in the ordinary Priſons, had ſuch liberty and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, as the places would afford, not inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for men that were in their caſes. But that our Brethren of the more fiery and Jeſuitical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour may not ſnuff hereat: we have thought it meet to cool their heat, with ſome of Maſter <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and his Fellow Maſter <hi>Creſwels</hi> more gentle delays, (than are uſual with them:) who in one of their Books, do confeſs as much in effect, as here we have ſet down, if not more: thus theſe great Emperour-like Jeſuits do ſpeak to her Majeſty. <hi>In the beginning of thy Kingdom thou didſt deal ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more gently with Catholicks: none were then urged by thee, or preſſed either to thy Sect, or to the denial of their Faith. All things (indeed) did ſeem to proceed in a far milder courſe: no great complaints were heard of: there were ſeen no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary contentions or repugnancies: Some there were that to pleaſe and gratifie you, went to</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62848:32"/>
                     <hi>your Churches. But when afterwards thou didſt begin to wrong them, &amp;c.</hi> And when was that our great <hi>Monſeigneurs?</hi> Surely whenſoever it was: (to anſwer for you) we our ſelves (certain Catholicks of all ſorts) were the true cauſes of it. For whilſt her Majeſty and the <hi>State</hi> dealt with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, as you have heard, (which was full eleven years, no one Catholick being called in queſtion of his life, for his conſcience, all that time:) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with us, how ſome of our profeſſion proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them. Her Highneſs had ſcarcely felt the Crown warm upon her head, but it was challenged from her, by ſome of her Neighbours, as Maſter <hi>Saunders</hi> noteth. The <hi>French</hi> were ſent into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to do ſomewhat, you may be ſure: which concerned her Majeſty (the circumſtances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) to look unto. Afterwards certain matters were undertaken by her Majeſty in <hi>France:</hi> and the Affairs in <hi>Scotland</hi> did ſo proceed, as that the <hi>Queen</hi> there was compelled 1567. to flie into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where for a great time, ſhe was very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably entertained, her liberty only excepted. But with theſe matters, what had we to do, that were either Prieſts or private men? If either <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> had cauſe to repine or complain, ſome of thoſe Nations might have done, written, and ſpoken as it had pleaſed them. It little became either Maſter <hi>Saunders</hi> (otherwiſe an excellent man) or Maſter <hi>Parſons,</hi> or any other of our own Nation, to have intermedled with thoſe matters, or to write as they have very offenſively done in divers of their Books and Treatiſes; to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we know not: except it were to ſhew their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62848:33"/>
malice, to diſhonour their own Country, as much as lay in them, and to move a greater diſlike in the State of all that be Catholicks, than before they had. Kings ever have had, and will have their plots and practices for their own ſafeties: it being as inconvenient to their Policy, for one Prince by his Might to over-top another, as it is amongſt the principal members of our natural bodies, for one member to ſwell or grow too great above his due proportion. Happy had we Catholicks been at this day, if theſe men being Prieſts, had never troubled themſelves with State-matters, which they have managed, as <hi>Phaeton</hi> did his Fathers Chariot: very greatly to our prejudice. Let them pretend never ſo great skill in their diſpoſing of Kingdoms <hi>ordine ad Deum:</hi> they have certainly dealt with ours <hi>ordine ad Gehennam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not all which the <hi>State</hi> may juſtly challenge us for. In the time of our ſaid Peace, and upon the coming into <hi>England</hi> of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whilſt her Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> were buſied, as partly you have heard before: it pitieth our hearts, to ſee and read, what hath been printed and publiſhed out of <hi>Italy</hi> in the life of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> concerning his Holineſs endeavors, ſtirred up by falſe ſuggeſtions to joyn with the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> for the utter ruine and overthrow both of our Prince and Country. Would to God ſuch things had never been enterpriſed: and moſt of all, that they had never been printed. We that have ſome skill with our Pens, preſume too much a great deal, upon our own Wits. What good
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62848:33"/>
the mentioning of theſe points can bring to the Church, we ſee not: but ſure we are, it hath done much hurt, and given our common Enemies very great advantage againſt us. For now it is uſually objected unto us, by every one of any reach, when we complain of ſome hard dealings towards us: Yea, ſay they (very well good Maſters) were you not in quiet? Who then gave the cauſe that you were troubled? When her Majeſty uſed you kindly: how treacherouſly was ſhe dealt with by you? Did not <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> practiſe her Majeſties ſubverſion: ſhe (good Lady) never dreaming of any ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief? Was not one <hi>Robert Ridolphi,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Florence</hi> ſent hither by the <hi>Pope</hi> (under colour of Merchandize) to ſollicite a Rebellion? Did not <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> move the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to joyn in this Exploit, for the better ſecuring of his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in the Low Countries? Was not the <hi>Bull</hi> denounced againſt her Majeſty, that carrieth ſo fair a Preface of zeal, and paſtoral duty: deviſed purpoſely, to further the intended Rebellion, for the depriving of her Majeſty from her Kingdom? Had not the <hi>Pope</hi> and King of <hi>Spain</hi> aſſigned the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to be the Head of this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Did not the <hi>Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> give order to <hi>Ridolphi,</hi> to take 150000 Crowns to ſet forward this attempt? Was not ſome of that Money ſent for <hi>Scotland:</hi> and ſome delivered to the ſaid Duke? Did not King <hi>Philip</hi> at the <hi>Popes</hi> inſtance, determine to ſend the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> into <hi>England</hi> with all his Forces in the Low Countries, to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk?</hi> Are all theſe things true, and were they not then in hand, whilſt her Majeſty dealt ſo merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62848:34"/>
with you? How can you excuſe theſe deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo unchriſtian, ſo unprieſtly, ſo treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and therefore ſo un-prince-like? When we firſt heard theſe particulars, we did not believe them: but would have laid our lives they had been falſe: but when we ſaw the Book, and found them there, God is our witneſs, we were much amazed: and can ſay no more, but that his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was miſinformed, and indirectly drawn to theſe courſes.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed: it being unknown to the <hi>State</hi> what ſecret matters were in hand againſt them, both at home and beyond the Seas: the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks here continued in ſort, as before you have heard, till the ſaid Rebellion brake forth in the North, 1569. a little before <hi>Chriſtmas:</hi> and that it was known that the <hi>Pope</hi> had excommunicated the <hi>Queen,</hi> and thereby freed her Subjects (as the <hi>Bull</hi> importeth) from their ſubjection. And then there followed a great reſtraint of the ſaid Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: but none of them were put to death upon that occaſion: the Sword being then only drawn againſt ſuch Catholicks, as had riſen up actually into open Rebellion. Wherein we cannot ſee what her Majeſty did, that any Prince in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſuch a caſe, would not have done. And as touching the ſaid Bull, many both Prieſts and Lay Catholicks have greatly wiſhed, that it had never been decreed, denounced, publiſhed, or heard of. For we are perſwaded, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was drawn thereunto, by falſe ſuggeſtions of certain undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet turbulent perſons: who pretending to him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62848:34"/>
one thing, had another drift in their heads for their own advancement. And therefore we have ever accounted of it, as a ſentence procured by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reption: knowing it to be no unuſual thing with the <hi>Pope,</hi> through indirect means and factious heads, to be often deceived in matters of Fact: as we now find it, in the ſetting up of our new Arch-Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>Now upon all theſe occaſions, her Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved with great diſpleaſure, called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the thirteenth year of her Reign 1571. wherein a Law was made containing many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, againſt the bringing into this Land, after that time, of any Bulls from <hi>Rome,</hi> any <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Pardons: and againſt all manner of perſons, that ſhould procure them to be ſo brought hither, with many other particularities thereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. Which Law, although we hold it to be too rigorous, and that the pretended remedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the meaſure of the offence, either unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given, or in juſtice to have been taken: yet we cannot but confeſs, as reaſonable men, that the <hi>State</hi> had great cauſe to make ſome Laws againſt us, except they ſhould have ſhewed themſelves careleſs for the continuance of it. But be the Law, as any would have it never ſo extreme: yet ſurely it muſt be granted, that the occaſions of it were moſt outragious: and likewiſe, that the execution of it was not ſo tragical, as many ſince have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and reported of it. For whatſoever was done againſt us, either upon the pretence of that Law, or of any other, would never we think have been
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62848:35"/>
attempted, had not divers other prepoſterous oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions (beſides the cauſes of that Law) daily fallen out amongſt us: which procured matters to be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged more ſeverely againſt us.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1572. out cometh Maſter <hi>Saunders</hi> Book, <hi>de viſibili Monarchia;</hi> wherein he taketh upon him to ſet down, how the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſent one Maſter <hi>Morton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Web</hi> two Prieſts, before the ſaid Rebellion, to the Lords and Gentlemen in the North: to excite them with their Followers to take up Arms. And the rather to perſwade them thereunto, they ſignified unto them by the <hi>Popes</hi> commandment, that her Majeſty was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, her Subjects were releaſed from their obedience, and much more to that purpoſe. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſaid Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> doth juſtifie the ſaid commotion, and aſcribeth the evil ſucceſs it had, to the over-late publiſhing of the ſaid Bull (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not generally known of till the year after, when Maſter <hi>Felton</hi> had ſet it upon the Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> Gate:) affirming that if it had been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the year before, or when they were in Arms, the Catholicks would undoubtedly ſo have aſſiſted them (the ſaid Rebels) as that they muſt (no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it) have prevailed againſt the <hi>Queen,</hi> and had certainly executed the ſaid ſentence at that time, for her depoſition from the Crown. Beſides, whereas the <hi>State</hi> in the ſaid Parliament, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the attainder of the chief perſons by name, that were as heads in the ſaid Rebellion: and had been in the field againſt her Highneſs, Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> (building Caſtles in the Air amongſt his Books)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62848:35"/>
doth too much magnifie the ſaid Rebels, to the great diſcredit of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs actions in ſuch matters, they being men ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, condemned, and executed by the ancient Laws of our Country for high Treaſon. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable and very uncatholick courſe thus held by divers, to the great offence of many good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of the graver and diſcreeter ſort, and to the great hinderance of our common Cauſe; hath been ſince followed by Mr. <hi>Parſons,</hi> and ſome of his ſort, with no good diſcretion or foreſight (God he knoweth) brag theſe great States-men of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Wiſdom and Policy never ſo proudly.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, about the coming out of the ſaid Book of Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> the whole Plot before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> for the diſinheriting of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and other intended miſchiefs, fell out to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcloſed. Afterwards within ſome four or five years, it was alſo commonly known to the Realm, what attempts were in hand by Mr. <hi>Stukeley</hi> (aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> and other Catholicks both <hi>Engliſh, Iriſh,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi>) for an Enterpriſe by force in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under pretence to advance the Catholick Religion: which for that time (through ſome defects) ſucceeding not, the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf in the year 1579. (abuſed ſtill by falſe pretences) did ſet forward that courſe, and ſending thither certain Forces, Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> (too much Jeſuited) did thruſt himſelf in perſon into that action, as a chief Ring-leader, and to perſwade the Catholicks, when he ſhould come into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to joyn with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62848:36"/>
the <hi>Popes</hi> ſaid Forces, for the better aſſiſting of certain Rebels, then in Arms againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. Now whilſt theſe practices were in hand in <hi>Ireland, Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth reneweth the ſaid Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus:</hi> and denounceth her Majeſty to be excommunicated, with intimation of all other particulars in the former Bull mentioned, which was procured (we doubt not) by ſurrepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the falſe Jeſuits (our Country-men) daring to attempt any thing, by untrue ſuggeſtions, and any lewd ſurmiſes, that may ſerve their turns. This Stratagem accompliſhed, and ground laid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they imagined to work great matters: theſe good Fathers (as the Devil would have it) come into <hi>England,</hi> and intruded themſelves into our harveſt, being the men in our conſciences (we mean both them and others of that Society, with ſome of their adherents) who have been the chief Inſtruments of all the miſchiefs that have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt her Majeſty, ſince the beginning of her Reign, and of the miſeries, which we, or any other Catholicks, have upon theſe occaſions ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained. Their firſt repair hither was <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. when the Realm of <hi>Ireland</hi> was in great combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then they entred, (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Campion</hi> the Subject, and Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> the Provincial) like a tempeſt, with ſundry ſuch great brags and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, as divers of the graveſt Clergy then living in <hi>England</hi> (Doctor <hi>Watſon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and others) did greatly diſlike them, and plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that (as things then ſtood) their proceeding after that faſhion, would certainly urge the State, to make ſome ſharper Laws, which ſhould not only
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62848:36"/>
touch them, but likewiſe all others, both Prieſts and Catholicks. Upon their arrival, and after the ſaid brags, Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> preſently fell to his Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal courſes: and ſo belaboured both himſelf and others in matters of State, how he might ſet her Majeſties Crown upon another head (as appeareth by a Letter of his own to a certain Earl) that the Catholicks themſelves threatned to deliver him into the hands of the Civil Magiſtrate, except he deſiſted from ſuch kind of practices.</p>
                  <p>In theſe tumultuous and rebellious proceedings by ſundry Catholicks, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> it could not be expected but that the <hi>Queen</hi> and the State would be greatly incenſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt us. We had (ſome of us) great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved the ſaid Rebellion: highly extolled the Rebels, and pitifully bewailed their ruine and overthrow. Many of our affections were knit to the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> and for our obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> we all do profeſs it. The attempts both of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> failing in <hi>England,</hi> his Holineſs, as a temporal Prince, diſplayed his Banner in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Plot was to deprive her Highneſs firſt from that Kingdom (if they could:) and then by degrees to depoſe her from this. In all theſe Plots none were more forward, than many of us that were Prieſts. The Laity, if we had oppoſed our ſelves to theſe deſignments, would (out of doubt) have been over-ruled by us. How many men of our calling<note place="margin">Saunders, Morton, Web, &amp;c.</note> were addicted to theſe courſes, the <hi>State</hi> knew not. In which caſe (the premiſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly conſidered) there is no King, or Prince in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62848:37"/>
the World, diſguſting the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and having either force or metal in him, that would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured us, if poſſibly he could have been revenged, but rather (as we think) have utterly rooted us out of his Territories, as Traiters and Rebels both to him and his Country. And therefore we may rejoyce unfeignedly, that God hath bleſſed this Kingdom with ſo gracious and merciful a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, who hath not dealt in this ſort with us. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly if ſhe were a Catholick, ſhe might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Mirror of the World: but as ſhe is, both we and all other Catholicks her natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, deſerve no longer to live, than we hereafter ſhall honour her from our hearts, obey her in all things (ſo far as poſſibly we may) pray for her proſperous Reign and long life: and to our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers defend and protect both her and our Country againſt any whatſoever, that ſhall by force of Arms attempt to damnifie either of them. For in the ſaid Garboils, and very undutiful proceedings, how hath her Highneſs dealt with us? From the time of the ſaid Rebellion and Parliament, there were few above twelve, that in ten years had been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for their conſciences (as we hold, although our Adverſaries ſay for Treaſon:) and of thoſe twelve ſome perhaps can hardly be drawn within our account, having been tainted with matters of Rebellion. The moſt of the ſaid number were Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Prieſts, who if they had come over into <hi>England</hi> with the like intents, that ſome others have done, might very worthily have been uſed as they were. But in our conſciences, nay ſome of us do know it, that they were far from thoſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62848:37"/>
ſeditious humors: being men that intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſimply the good of our Country, and the converſion of Souls. Marry to ſay the truth, as we have confeſſed before, how could either her Majeſty or the State know ſo much? They had great cauſe, as Politick perſons, to ſuſpect the worſt.</p>
                  <p>Beſides to the further honour of her Majeſty we may not omit, that the States of the whole Realm aſſembled in Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1576. were pleaſed to paſs us over, and made no Laws at that time againſt us. The ancient Priſoners that had been reſtrained more narrowly in the year 1570. were (notwithſtanding the ſaid enterpriſes in <hi>Ireland</hi>) again reſtored to their former liberty, to continue with their friends as they had done before. Such as were not ſuſpected to have been dealers or abettors in the ſaid treaſonable actions, were uſed with that humanity, which could well be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But when the Jeſuits were come, and that the State had notice of the ſaid Excommunication, there was then within a while a great alteration. For ſuch were the Jeſuits proceedings, and with ſo great boldneſs, as though all had been theirs, and that the State ſhould preſently have been chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
                  <p>Her Majeſty had ſeen what followed in her Kingdom upon the firſt Excommunication: and was therefore in all worldly Policy to prevent the like by the ſecond. The jealouſie alſo of the State was much increaſed by Mr. <hi>Sherwins</hi> anſwers upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62848:38"/>
his examination, above eight months before the apprehenſion of Mr. <hi>Campion.</hi> For being asked, whether the <hi>Queen</hi> was his lawful Soveraign, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any ſentence of the Popes, he prayed that no ſuch queſtion might be demanded of him, and would not further thereunto anſwer. Two or three other queſtions much to the ſame effect, were likewiſe propounded unto him, which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo refuſed to anſwer. Matters now ſorting on this, faſhion, there was a greater reſtraint of Catholicks, than at any time before. Many both Prieſts and Gentlemen were ſent into the Iſle of <hi>Ely</hi> and other places, there to be more ſafely kept and looked unto. In <hi>January</hi> following 1581. (according to the general computation,) a Proclamation was made for the calling home of her Majeſties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects beyond the Seas: (ſuch eſpecially as were trained up in the Seminaries) pretending that they learned little there, but diſloyalty: and that none after that time ſhould harbor or relieve them, with ſundry other points of very hard intendment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. The ſame month alſo a Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, wherein a Law was made agreeable in effect to the ſaid Proclamation, but with a more ſevere puniſhment annexed. For it was a penalty of death, for any Jeſuit or Seminary Prieſt to repair into <hi>England,</hi> and for any to receive and entertain them, which fell out according to <hi>Biſhop Watſons</hi> former ſpeeches or prediction, what iniſchief the Jeſuits would bring upon us. We could here as well as ſome others have done, ſhew our diſlike with ſome bitterneſs of the ſaid Law and penalty. But to what purpoſe ſhould we do ſo? It had been
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62848:38"/>
a good point of wiſdom in two or three perſons, that have taken that courſe, to have been ſilent: and rather have ſought by gentleneſs and ſweet carriage of themſelves to have prevented the more ſharp execution of that Law, than by exclaiming againſt it when it was too late, to have provoked the <hi>State</hi> to a greater ſeverity againſt us. And to confeſs ſomething to our own diſadvantage, and to excuſe the ſaid Parliament: if all the Seminary Prieſts then in <hi>England,</hi> or which ſhould after that time have come hither, had been of Mr. <hi>Mortons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> mind before mentioned (when the firſt Excommunication came out,) or of Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> his ſecond reſolution, (being then in Arms againſt her Majeſty in <hi>Ireland:</hi>) or of Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> traiterous diſpoſition, both to our <hi>Queen</hi> and Country: the ſaid Law (no doubt) had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with it a far greater ſhew of Juſtice. But that was the error of the <hi>State:</hi> and yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (for ought they knew) improbable, thoſe times being ſo full of many dangerous deſignments and Jeſuitical practices.</p>
                  <p>In this year alſo, divers other things fell out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily towards us poor Prieſts, and other the graver ſort of Catholicks, who had all of us ſingle hearts, and diſliked (no men more) of all ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious enterpriſes. For notwithſtanding the ſaid Proclamation and Law, Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi> a Jeſuit came then into <hi>England,</hi> and took ſo much upon him, that Father <hi>Parſons</hi> fell out exceedingly with him: and great troubles grew amongſt Catholicks, by their brablings and quarrels. A Synod was held
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62848:39"/>
by him the ſaid Mr. <hi>Heywood,</hi> and ſundry ancient Cuſtoms were therein abrogated, to the offence of very many. Theſe courſes being underſtood (after a ſort) by the State: the Catholicks and Prieſts in <hi>Norfolk</hi> felt the ſmart of it. This Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer alſo in <hi>July,</hi> Mr. <hi>Campion</hi> and other Prieſts were apprehended: whoſe anſwers upon their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations, agreeing in effect with Mr. <hi>Sherwins</hi> before mentioned, did greatly incenſe the State. For amongſt other queſtions that were propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, this being one, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Pope do by his Bull or Sentence pronounce her Majeſty to be deprived, and no lawful <hi>Queen,</hi> and her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to be diſcharged of their allegiance and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto her; and after, the Pope or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his appointment and authority do invade this Realm: which part would you take, or which part ought a good Subject of <hi>England</hi> to take? ſome anſwered, that when the caſe ſhould happen, they would then take counſel, what were beſt for them to do: Another, that when that caſe ſhould happen he would anſwer, and not before: Another, that for the preſent, he was not reſolved what to do in ſuch a caſe: Another, that when the caſe happeneth, then he will anſwer: Another, that if ſuch deprivation and invaſion ſhould be made for any matter of his faith, he thinketh he were then bound to take part with the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Now, what King in the world, being in doubt to be invaded by his enemies, and fearing that ſome of his own Subjects were by indirect means drawn, rather to adhere unto them than to himſelf: would
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62848:39"/>
not make the beſt tryal of them he could for his better ſatisfaction, whom he might truſt to? In which tryal, if he found any, that either ſhould make doubtful anſwers, or peremptorily affirm, that (as the caſe ſtood betwixt him and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) they would leave him their Prince and take part with them: might he not juſtly repute them for Traitors, and deal with them accordingly? Sure we are, that no King or Prince in Chriſtendom, would like or tolerate any ſuch Subjects within their Dominions, if poſſibly they could be rid of them.</p>
                  <p>The duty we owe to our Soveraigns, doth not conſiſt in taciturnity or keeping cloſe within our ſelves ſuch Allegiance as we think ſufficient to afford them: but we are (eſpecially when we are required thereunto) to make open profeſſion of it, that we may appear unto them to be ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as we ought to be, and as they may rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if either their Kingdoms or ſafeties be in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard or danger. And we greatly marvel, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jeſuits ſhould be ſo hard laced (concerning the performance of their duties, towards the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Kings of thoſe Countries where they were born, and whoſe Vaſſals they are) conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto what obedience they tye themſelves toward their own general, provincial, and other Governors: unto whom they were no way tied, but by their own conſents, and for that it hath pleaſed them voluntarily to ſubmit themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. If a quarrel ſhould fall out, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, betwixt the Jeſuits and the Dominicans, it would ſeem a very ſtrange matter to the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62848:40"/>
or General of that Society, to be driven to be demanded of a Jeſuit, which part he would take. But therewith we have not to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: only we wiſh, that whilſt they look for ſo great ſubjection at thoſe mens hands that be under them, they do not forget their own Allegiance towards their Soveraigns: or at the leaſt ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves as we poor men (every way their equals, and as ſound Catholicks as themſelves, that we go no further) may not be brought into hatred with her Majeſty, unto whom we profeſs all duty and true allegiance: let other men quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame as they liſt.</p>
                  <p>About the time of the overthrow of the Popes Forces in <hi>Ireland:</hi> his Holineſs (by the falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigations of the Jeſuits) plotted with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the aſſiſtance of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to enterpriſe upon the ſudden, a very deſperate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment againſt her Majeſty: and for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and advancement to the Crown of the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> For the better effecting whereof, <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi> the Jeſuit and Ledger for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſet on work (a worthy Gentleman otherwiſe) one Mr. <hi>Francis Throckmorton</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others. And whilſt the ſame was in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (as afterwards Mr. <hi>Throckmorton</hi> himſelf confeſſed 1584.) the ſaid Jeſuitical humor had ſo poſſeſſed the hearts of ſundry Catholicks, as we do unfeignedly rue in our hearts the remembrance of it, and are greatly aſhamed that any perſon ſo intituled, ſhould ever have been ſo extremely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched. Two Gentlemen about that time alſo,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62848:40"/>
                     <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1583. Mr. <hi>Arden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Somervile</hi> were convicted by the Laws of the Realm, to have purpoſed and contrived how they might have laid violent hands upon her Majeſties ſacred perſon. Mr. <hi>Somerviles</hi> confeſſion therein, was ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as it may not be either qualified or denied. And Doctor <hi>Parry</hi> the very ſame year, was plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with Jeſuits beyond the Seas, how he might have effected the like villany. How the worthy Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> was about this time brought into the ſaid Plot of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> (then ſtill in hand) we will pretermit. Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> that was an Actor in it, could tell the ſtory very roundly at <hi>Rome:</hi> It wrought the noble Earls overthrow 1585. which may juſtly be aſcribed to the Jeſuitical practices of the Jeſuit <hi>Mendoza</hi> and others of that crew. Hereunto we might add the notable Treaſons of Mr. <hi>Anthony Babington</hi> and his Complices in the year 1586. which were ſo apparent, as we were greatly abaſhed at the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs boldneſs of a young Jeſuit, who to excuſe the ſaid Traiters, and qualifie their offences, preſumed in a kind of ſupplication to her Majeſty, to aſcribe the plotting of all that miſchief to Mr. Secretary <hi>Walſingham.</hi> The treachery alſo of Sir <hi>William Standley</hi> the year following 1587. in falſifying his faith to her Majeſty, and in betraying the truſt committed unto him by the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> who had given him the honourable Title of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: as it was greatly prejudicial to us, that were Catholicks, at home, ſo was the defence of that diſloyalty (made by a worthy man, but by the perſwaſions (as they think) of <hi>Parſons</hi>) greatly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62848:41"/>
diſliked of many both wiſe and learned. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially it was wondred at a while (until the drift thereof appeared more manifeſtly in the year 1588.) that the ſaid worthy perſon by the ſaid lewd Jeſuits, laid down this for a ground, in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the ſaid <hi>Standley:</hi> viz. <hi>That in all Wars, which may happen for Religion, every Catholick man is bound in conſcience to imploy his perſon and forces by the Popes direction:</hi> viz. <hi>How far, when, and where, either at home or abroad, he may and muſt break with his temporal Soveraign.</hi> Theſe things we would not have touched, had they not been known in effect to this part of the World: and that we thought it our duties to ſhew our own diſlike of them: and to clear her Majeſty (ſo far as we may) from ſuch imputations of more than barbarous cruelty towards us, as the Jeſuits in their writings, have caſt by heaps upon her: they themſelves (as we ſtill think in our conſciences and before God) having been from time to time the very cauſes of all the calamities, which any of us have endured in <hi>England</hi> ſince her Majeſties reign. Which we do not write, ſimply to excuſe her Highneſs, although we muſt confeſs, we can be contented to endure much, rather than to ſeek her diſhonour: but for that we think few Princes living, being perſwaded in Religion as her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is, and ſo provoked as ſhe hath been, would have dealt more mildly with ſuch their Subjects (all circumſtances conſidered) than ſhe hath done with us.</p>
                  <p>But now we are come to the year 1588. and to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62848:41"/>
that moſt bloody attempt, not only againſt her Majeſty and our common Enemies, but againſt our ſelves, all Catholicks: nay againſt this flouriſhing Kingdom and our own native Country. The memory of which attempt will be (as we truſt) an everlaſting Monument of Jeſuitical Treaſon and Cruelty. For it is apparent in a Treatiſe penned by the advice of Father <hi>Parſons</hi> altogether, (as we do verily think) that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was eſpecially moved and drawn to that intended miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief againſt us, by the long and daily ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Jeſuits, and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholicks beyond the Seas, affected and altogether given to Jeſuitiſm. And whereas it is well known, that the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> had given it out directly, that if once he might land in <hi>England, both Catholicks and Hereticks that came in his way ſhould be all one to him: his Sword could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, ſo he might make way for his Maſter, all was one to him:</hi> yet the ſaid Father <hi>Parſons</hi> (for ſo we will ever charge him, though another man by his crafty perſwaſion took upon him to be the Author of that Book) did labour with all the Rhetorick he had to have perſwaded us, upon the ſuppoſed arrival of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to have joyned with him to our own deſtructions: telling us many fair tales, and alluring us with ſundry great promiſes, all of them meer illuſions, falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, and moſt traiterous inſtigations and jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. He aſcribeth it to <hi>error of Conſcience, and want of courage,</hi> terming the ſame an <hi>effeminate dastardy: that we had then ſuffered her Majesty almaſt thirty years to reign over us.</hi> He threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62848:42"/>
us with <hi>Excommunication, and utter ruine both of our ſelves and all our Poſterity, if we did then any longer obey, abet, or aid, defend or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her Highneſs to be our Queen, or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: and did not forthwith joyn our ſelves with all our Forces to the Spaniards.</hi> The good Cardinal (by <hi>Parſons</hi> means) is drawn to ſay, <hi>That the Pope had made him Cardinal, intending to ſend him as his Legat, for the ſweeter managing of this (forſooth) godly and great Affair: and to affirm upon his honour and in the word of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, that in the fury of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>intended Conqueſt, there ſhould be as great care had of every Catholick and penitent perſon, as poſſibly could be.</hi> And to allure the Nobility of this Realm, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them <hi>to become an humble Suiter on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfs, that (ſo as they ſhew them ſelves valiant in aſſiſting the King of</hi> Spain'<hi>s Forces) they might continue their noble Names and Families.</hi> Surely they had been wiſe men, that ſhould have relyed much either upon his promiſe, or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> courteſie. This Jeſuit alſo telleth all Catholicks, the better to comfort them (but indeed to the great ſcandal for ever of all Prieſthood,) and to ſhew how juſt and holy the cauſe was they had in hand: that <hi>there were divers Prieſts in the Kings Army, ready to ſerve every mans ſpiritual neceſſity, by Confeſſion, Counſel, and all conſolation in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Alſo he ſo advanceth the Forces of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; extenuateth her Majeſties abilities to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, as he accounted the Victory obtained in effect before they were landed, telling us, <hi>That beſides the ſaid great Forces, we ſhould ſo be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62848:42"/>
                     <hi>by the bleſſed Patrons both of Heaven and Earth, with the guard of all Gods holy Angels, with our bleſſed Saviour himſelf in the ſoveraign Sacrament, and with the daily moſt holy oblation of Chriſts own dear body and blood, as it could not fall out otherwiſe, but that we muſt needs prevail.</hi> Which kind of perſwaſions, ſome of them being ridiculous, the moſt very traiterous, and theſe laſt moſt blaſphemous, as tending ſo greatly to the diſhonour of Religion, we deteſt and abhor. And in all theſe Jeſuitical and diſloyal practices, this is our comfort, that albeit we doubt not, but that the Pope as a temporal Prince did joyn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards this intended Invaſion: yet we find Father <hi>Parſons</hi> declaration of <hi>Xiſtus Quintus</hi> ſentence of depoſition of her Majeſty at that time, and of his admonition thereunto adjoyned, as in the Popes name, to have no warrant at all beſides his own bare affirmation, either of <hi>Breve</hi> or of any other publick Inſtrument, as in ſuch caſes had been moſt neceſſary, otherwiſe than that he told us, it was the Popes pleaſure that we ſhould take notice thereof by his Book which was then prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to have been ſcattered amongſt us. By warrant whereof (as we are perſwaded) it was not lawful for us to have killed a Gooſe, if her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had forbidden us ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe matters (to return ſtill to our former Apologies) we would have ſaid nothing, were they not objected unto us, and ſhewed us out of the Books themſelves, as notes and arguments of our traiterous hearts: our Adverſaries preſſing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62848:43"/>
the ſame upon us, as if they did belong unto us, and we were as guilty of them, as either they that plotted or publiſhed them. Which conceit, if it ſhould take root in thoſe that be in Authority, how could we hope for any favour, but were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to expect the greateſt extremity that might be? So as ſtill we may ſay, that the proceedings held againſt her Majeſty well weighed, theſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Jeſuitical practices, have been the cauſe of all our troubles.</p>
                  <p>When it had pleaſed God to deliver her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and this Kingdom from the ſaid intended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> whether aſhamed of the foil, (for the ſucceſs whereof he was ſo peremptory) or for that he thought matters would be better managed in <hi>Spain,</hi> if he were there to give his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, departed from <hi>Rome</hi> (as we take it) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Courtier to attend King <hi>Philip:</hi> where by <hi>Mendoza</hi> his fellow Jeſuit's means, he grew ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into ſo great eſtimation (not for any goodneſs in him towards this Realm, you may be ſure, but rather in reſpect of his deadly hatred againſt it) that he procured a Seminary to be erected at <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledolyd</hi> 1589. But we will leave his proceedings in <hi>Spain</hi> a while.</p>
                  <p>In theſe ten years laſt mentioned from 1580. till 1590. or but little before, we find her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to be excommunicated by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth: Mr. <hi>Sherwin</hi> and the reſt of our Brethren too much Jeſuited, refuſe to anſwer, whether they will take the Queens part or the Popes, if he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62848:43"/>
ſhould come by force of Arms to aſſail her in her own Kingdom: <hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Heywood</hi> are found to be Practitioners, but eſpecially <hi>Parſons.</hi> The intention of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> is entertained here and proſecuted: Her Majeſties life is ſought by treachery: <hi>Babington</hi> and his Companions ſhoot at the Crown: <hi>Stanley</hi> is a Treacherer, breaketh his faith, and is defended for ſo doing. Then followed the Invaſion: and laſtly, <hi>Parſons</hi> plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the erection of new Seminaries there. Now let us conſider, how we our ſelves all this while have been dealt with. Such of us as remained in Priſon at <hi>Wisbich</hi> (and were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thither 1580. and others not long after committed alſo thither, to the number of about thirty three or thirty four) continued ſtill in the ſeveral times of all the ſaid moſt wicked deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as we were before: and were never brought into any trouble for them, but lived there, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge-like, without any want, and in good reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with our Neighbours that were Catholicks about us. It is true that towards the number of fifty (as our memory ſerveth us) Prieſts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks of all ſorts, within the compaſs of the ſaid ten years were put to death: we ſay upon our knowledges (concerning the moſt of them) for their conſciences: but our Adverſaries (as they think) do ſtill affirm for Treaſon. Such Prieſts as in their examination were found any thing mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, were not ſo hardly proceeded with: inſomuch as fifty five (to our remembrance) that by the Laws (we acknowledge) might likewiſe have been put to death, were in one year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1585. (what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62848:44"/>
time great miſchiefs were in hand) ſpared from that extremity, and only baniſhed. Which fact, howſoever ſome have written of it, the parties themſelves accounted it for a great benefit, and ſo would they alſo have done (we doubt not of it) if they had been then of that number. Whereas therefore Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> (as we think) exclaimeth in a Pamphlet ſet out ſhortly after, ſaying, <hi>Where are now the old Tyrants of the World,</hi> Nero, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Diocleſian, Maxentius, <hi>and the reſt of the great perſecutors of the Chriſtians? Where is</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerick <hi>and</hi> Hunricus <hi>with their Arrian Hereticks?</hi> alluding to the <hi>State</hi> here: we think both him, and divers others that have written to the ſame effect, very greatly to blame. Sure we are, that the general cauſe of Religion, for the which both we and they contend (as oft we have ſaid) get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no good but hurt by it: and contrary to the old ſaying, (be he never ſo bad, yet let him have juſtice) though ſome hard courſes have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>State</hi> againſt us; yet hath it not by many degrees been ſo extreme, as the Jeſuits and that crew have falſely written and reported of it.</p>
                  <p>But to return to Father <hi>Parſons</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and to proceed in the courſe of things which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince 1590. The ſaid Father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſo managed the ſaid Seminary erected in <hi>Valledolyd,</hi> as within three years, <hi>viz.</hi> 1591. twelve or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Prieſts were ſent hither from thence. Alſo he procured ſome other Seminaries to be erected in <hi>Spain,</hi> and furniſhed them with ſuch Students as he thought fit, which (for our parts) we great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62848:44"/>
commend in him, if he took this pains, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his favour with the King to a good end: whereof we have ſome doubt, knowing the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits fetches: but the <hi>State</hi> here did utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him for it, finding that both he and ſome others were plotting and labouring by all the means they could for a new Invaſion. Whereupon a Proclamation was ſet out 1591. as well for an inquiry or ſearch for all ſuch Seminary Prieſts, as either were, or ſhould hereafter come from <hi>Spain,</hi> as alſo from any other Seminaries beyond the Seas, upon ſuſpicion, that they were ſent hither for no other end, but to prepare a way for the ſaid Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Whereas we are verily perſwaded in our conſciences, and do know it for many, that the Prieſts themſelves had no ſuch intention, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Jeſuits had that ſent them. Againſt the ſaid Proclamation, three or four have whet their Pens: but ſtill, whilſt they ſeek to diſgrace and gall the <hi>State,</hi> they have ever thereby wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beaten us, being themſelves in the mean time void of all danger. One of them, Mr. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> by name, (as we ſuppoſe) writing in his ſaid Pamphlet of the new intended Invaſion, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſaid Proclamation, telleth us, <hi>That the King hath juſt cauſe to attempt again that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>That the King is ſo intereſſed (together with the Pope) to ſeck</hi> (as he termeth it) <hi>her Majeſties reformation, that he the ſaid King is bound in. Juſtice to do it, and cannot without prejudice of his high eſtimation and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs refuſe at the ſoonest opportunity to attempt it.</hi> Marry withal to comfort us, he writeth, <hi>That the</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:62848:45"/>
                     <hi>King intendeth no rigorous dealing with our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the proſecution of his Invaſion, when he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hither.</hi> Which great favour of the King to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, we are to aſcribe to good Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> if we may believe his dutiful Subject Mr. <hi>Southwell</hi> the Jeſuit. For thus he telleth us, <hi>If ever,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the King ſhould prevail in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment (of his new Invaſion) Father</hi> Parſons <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with Cardinal</hi> Alanes <hi>Authority hath done that in our Countries behalf, for which his most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemies, and generally all her Majesties Subjects ſhall have cauſe to thank him for his ſerviceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, ſo far hath he inclined fury to clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and rage to compaſſion.</hi> Sure we are greatly beholding to this good Father, that hath had ſo kind a remembrance of us. But we wiſh that he had rather imployed himſelf as a religious man in the ſervice of God, and his private meditations, than thus to have buſied himſelf in ſetting forward and qualifying it, when he hath done ſo outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a deſignment: and do pray with all our hearts, that neither we nor this Kingdom do ever fall into the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whoſe unſpeakable cruelties in other Countries, a worthy Catholick Biſhop hath notably deſcribed to all poſterity. The ſame Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> alſo, together with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jeſuit Mr. <hi>Creſwell</hi> (as men that pretend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary love to their Country) have written a large Volume againſt the ſaid Proclamation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what malice and contempt can deviſe, that might provoke her Majeſty to indignation againſt us, is there ſet out very skilfully, they themſelves well knowing that no other fruit or benefit could
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62848:45"/>
come unto us by that diſcourſe, except it were ſtill to plague us.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the ſaid Invaſion was thus talked of, and in preparation in <hi>Spain,</hi> a ſhorter courſe was thought of, if it might have had ſucceſs. Mr. <hi>Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> was ſet on by the Jeſuits 1592. or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, with Father <hi>Parſons</hi> conſent or knowledge, to have ſtirred up the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> to rebellion againſt her Highneſs.</p>
                  <p>Not long after good Father <hi>Holt</hi> and others with him, perſwaded an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man one <hi>Patrick Collen</hi> (as he himſelf confeſſed) to attempt the laying of his violent and villanous hands upon her Majeſty. Shortly after in the year 1593. that notable Stratagem was plotted (the whole State knoweth by whom,) for Doctor <hi>Lopez</hi> the <hi>Queens</hi> Phyſician to have poyſoned her, for the which he was executed the year after. This wicked deſignment being thus prevented by Gods providence, the ſaid traiterous Jeſuit, <hi>Holt</hi> and others, did allure and animate one <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> to have accompliſhed that with their bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hands, that the other purpoſed to have done with his poyſon: we mean her Majeſties deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Hereunto we might add the late villanous attempt 1599. of <hi>Edward Squire,</hi> animated and drawn thereunto (as he confeſſed) by <hi>Walpole</hi> that pernicious Jeſuit. But we muſt turn again to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons,</hi> whoſe turnings and doublings are ſuch as would trouble a right good Hound to trace him. For in the mean time, that the ſaid
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62848:46"/>
Traiters one after another, were plotting and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying, how beſt they might compaſs her Majeſties death they cared not how, nor by what means, he the ſaid Father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſo prevailed with the King, as he attempted twice in two ſundry years, his new Invaſion, meaning to have proceeded therein, not with ſuch great preparation as he did at the firſt, but only to have begun the ſame, by taking ſome Port Weſtward, toward which he came ſo far onward as <hi>Silley</hi> with his Fleet. At both which times, God, who ſtill hath fought for her Majeſty and this Realm, did notably prevent him, by ſuch winds and tempeſts, as the moſt of his Ships and men periſhed in the Sea, as they were coming hitherward. Furthermore the ſaid good Father in the midſt of all the ſaid traiterous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes both at home and abroad (deviſed and ſet forward by him and his Companions) was plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding amongſt his Papers, and playing the Herald: how, if all his ſaid wicked deſignments failed, he might at the leaſt, intitle the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Daughter to the Crown and Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> To which purpoſe he framed, and afterwards publiſhed a Book, wherewith he acquainted the Students in thoſe Seminaries in <hi>Spain:</hi> and laboured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, <hi>than to have their ſubſcriptions to the ſaid</hi> Infantaes <hi>title, therein promiſing unto her their preſent Allegiance, as unto their lawful Soveraign: and that when they ſhould be ſent into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they ſhould perſwade the Catholicks there to do the like, without any further expectation of the Queen of</hi> England's <hi>death,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Charles Paget</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:62848:46"/>
affirmeth in his Book againſt <hi>Parſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſpake of the Seminaries in <hi>Spain</hi> before, ſomewhat ſuſpiciouſly: and now you ſee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that moved us ſo to do. Beſides we do not doubt, but that in the peruſing of this our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, you will be aſſaulted with many ſtrange cogitations, concerning our full intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein. Which although it cannot chuſe, but that it doth already in part appear unto you; yet now we come to a more clear and plain decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our purpoſe. You ſee into what hatred the wicked attempts of the Jeſuits againſt her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the State, hath brought not only all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in general, but more eſpecially us that are ſecular Prieſts, although we did ever diſlike and blame them, nay deteſt and hate them, no men more. For any of us to have been brought up in the Seminaries beyond the Seas, hath been, and ſtill is (as you know) a matter here very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to us full of danger. But by Father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> courſes with the Seminaries in <hi>Spain,</hi> and now that he is <hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seminary in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo taketh upon him by his favour there to direct and command all the reſt: what will the State here think of the Prieſts, that ſhall come from any of thoſe Seminaries hereafter, where they muſt be brought up, according to the Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal humor, and ſent hither with ſuch directions as ſhall be thereunto agreeable? The ſaid Book of Titles compiled by <hi>Parſons,</hi> is here very well known, almoſt to the whole Realm: and Mr. <hi>Charles Paget</hi> hath not been ſilent as touching the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and the bringing up of Students to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62848:47"/>
ſent hither, as Prieſts to promote her title. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſharp courſes have been taken already with us, and many Laws are made againſt us. But now, what may we expect, but all the cruelty that ever was deviſed againſt any man, if the State ſhould think both us, and all other Catholicks to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addicted, or any way inclined to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any foreign Title againſt her Majeſty, or her lawful Succeſſors.</p>
                  <p>And it cannot chuſe, but that we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be the rather ſuſpected, becauſe at this time it is well known, that the infection of Jeſuitiſm doth bear great ſway in <hi>England</hi> amongſt us, whilſt our Archprieſt (who taketh upon him to rule all) is himſelf over-ruled by <hi>Garnet</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, who as a moſt baſe Vaſſal, is in every thing at the beck and command of Father <hi>Parſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the avoiding therefore of all the further miſchiefs that may enſue, we firſt profeſs (as before we have often done) that we do utterly diſlike and condemn in our conſciences, all the ſaid ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Writings and Pamphlets, which have been publiſhed to the ſlander of her Majeſty and this Realm, proteſting that the Jeſuitical deſignments beyond the Seas, together with certain rebellious and traiterous attempts of ſome Catholicks at home, have been the cauſes of ſuch calamities and troubles, as have happened unto us: great (we confeſs) in themſelves, but far leſs (we think) than any Prince living in her Majeſties caſe, and ſo provoked would have inflicted upon us. Some of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62848:47"/>
us have ſaid many a time, when we have read and heard ſpeeches of her Majeſties ſuppoſed cruelty. Why my Maſters? what would you have her to do, being reſolved as ſhe is in matters of Religion, except ſhe ſhould willingly caſt off the care, not only of her State and Kingdom, but of her life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and Princely eſtimation? Yea, there have been amongſt us of our own calling, who have likewiſe ſaid, <hi>That they themſelves, knowing what they do know, how under pretence of Religion, the life of her Majeſty, and the ſubverſion of the Kingdom is aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at: if they had been of her Highneſſes Council, they would have given their conſent, for the making of very ſtrait and rigorous Laws to the better ſuppreſſing and preventing of all ſuch Jeſuitical and wicked deſignments.</hi> Secondly, we do all of us acknowledge, that by our Learning (ſecluding all <hi>Machiavilian Maxims</hi>) Eccleſiaſtical perſons by virtue of their calling are only to meddle with praying, preaching, and adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſuch other like ſpiritual Functions, and not to ſtudy how to murder Princes, nor to lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Kingdoms, nor to intrude themſelves into matters of State, Succeſſions, and Invaſions, as Fryer <hi>George</hi> did in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> to the utter ruine of that beautiful Realm. Thirdly; we profeſs our ſelves, with all godly courage and boldneſs, to be as ſound and true Catholick Prieſts, as any Jeſuits, or men living in the world, and that we do not deſire to draw breath any longer upon the earth, than that we ſhall ſo continue; but yet therewith we being born her Majeſties Subjects, do plainly affirm and reſolutely acknowledge it, without all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62848:48"/>
Jeſuitical equivocation, that if the Pope himſelf (as ſome of the Apoſtles did) do come into this Land; or if he do ſend hither ſome <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> as <hi>Eleutherus</hi> did, or ſome <hi>Auguſtine, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> or <hi>Juſtus,</hi> as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> did, we will to do them ſervice, go unto them, and lye down at their feet, and defend with them the Catholick faith by the ſacred Scriptures, and authority of the Church, though it coſt us our lives. But if he come or ſend hither an Army, under pretence to eſtabliſh the ſaid Catholick Religion, by force, and with the Sword, we will ever be moſt ready, as native born and true Subjects to her Highneſs, with the hazard of our lives, and with all our might, to withſtand and oppoſe our ſelves againſt him, and to ſpend the beſt blood in our bodies in defence of the <hi>Queen</hi> and our Country. For we are throughly perſwaded, that Prieſts of what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſoever, ought not by force of Arms, to plant or water the Catholick faith, but in <hi>ſpiritu leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis &amp; manſuetudinis</hi> to propagate and defend it. So it was planted in the Primitive Church, over all the World: <hi>&amp; creſcit &amp; fructificat ſicut &amp; in nobis eſt, ex quo die recepimus.</hi> The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent godly Chriſtians, though they had ſufficient forces, did not oppoſe themſelves in Arms againſt their Lords the Emperours, though of another Religion. But our purpoſe is not to diſpute this point.</p>
                  <p>And now laſtly, we commend unto you all (our very right dear and beloved Brethren) this our moſt humble Suit. Firſt, that you will interpret
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62848:48"/>
the whole premiſes no otherwiſe than we our ſelves have expounded our own meaning. Secondly, we intreat you to remember, how dear we have been unto you, and that we continue our unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affection towards you ſtill: aſſuring you, that howſoever you are changed, we do affect you ſtill, with a true and jealous love in Chriſt Jeſu.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we deſire you by the mercies of God, to take heed of Novelties and Jeſuitiſm: for it is nothing but treachery, diſſimulation, ambition, and a very vizard of moſt deep hypocriſie. When other Kingdoms begin to loath them, why ſhould you ſo far debaſe your ſelves, as to admire them? Give us not occaſion to ſay with the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: You fooliſh <hi>Galatians</hi> who hath bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, never give ear to any private Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perers, or Jeſuitical perſwaſions, that ſhall tend to allure you from your duties and allegiance unto her Majeſty, or your native Country. All argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that can be brought to corrupt you in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aſſure your ſelves, are falſe and unlearned ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtications. The Catholick faith, for her ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and continuance hath no need of any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery or rebellion. The promiſe made to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> is her ſure ground, and is more diſhonoured with treaſons, and wicked policies of carnal men, than any way furthered or advanced. The word of the ſpirit, and not the ſword of the fleſh, or any arm of man is that, which giveth life and beauty to the Catholick Church. We are fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62848:49"/>
in our conſciences, and as men beſides our Learning, who have ſome experience, that if the Catholicks had never ſought by indirect means to have vexed her Majeſty with their deſignments againſt her Crown: if the Pope and King of <hi>Spain</hi> had never plotted with the Duke of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> if the Rebels in the North had never been heard of: if the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> had never been known: if the ſaid Rebellion had never been juſtified: if neither <hi>Stukeley</hi> nor the Pope had attempted any thing againſt <hi>Ireland:</hi> if <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth had not renewed the ſaid Excommunication: if the Jeſuits had never come into <hi>England:</hi> if the Pope and King of <hi>Spain</hi> had not practiſed with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> for his attempt againſt her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: if <hi>Parſons</hi> and the reſt of the Jeſuits, with other our Country-men beyond the Seas, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Agents in thoſe traiterous and bloody deſignments of <hi>Throckmorton, Parry, Collen, York, Williams, Squire</hi> and ſuch like: If they had not by their Treatiſes and Writings endeavoured to defame their Soveraign, and their own Country, labouring to have many of their Books to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into divers languages, thereby to ſhew more their own diſloyalty: if Cardinal <hi>Alane</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> had not publiſhed the renovation of the ſaid Bull by <hi>Xiſtus Quintus:</hi> if thereunto they had not added their ſcurrilous and unmanly admonition, or rather moſt prophane Libel againſt her Majeſty: if they had not ſought by falſe perſwaſions, and ungodly arguments, to have allured the hearts of all Catholicks from their Allegiance: if the Pope had never been urged by them to have thruſt the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62848:49"/>
King of <hi>Spain</hi> into that barbarous action againſt the Realm: if they themſelves with all the reſt of that generation, had not laboured greatly with the ſaid King for the Conqueſt and Invaſion of this Land by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are known to be the cruelleſt Tyrants that live upon the earth: if in all their proceedings, they had not from time to time depraved, irritated, and provoked both her Majeſty and the State, with theſe and many other ſuch like their moſt ungodly and unchriſtian practices: but on the contrary, if the Popes from time to time had ſought her Majeſty, by kind offices and gentle perſwaſions, never ceaſing the proſecution of thoſe and ſuch like courſes of humanity and gentleneſs: if the Catholicks and Prieſts beyond the Seas had laboured continually the furtherance of thoſe moſt Prieſt-like and divine allurements, and had framed their own proceedings in all their works and writings accordingly: if we at home all of us, both Prieſts and people had poſſeſſed our ſouls in meekneſs and humility, honoured her Majeſty, born with the infirmities of the <hi>State,</hi> ſuffered all things, and dealt as true Catholick Prieſts: if all of us (we ſay) had thus done, moſt aſſuredly the State would have loved us, or at leaſt born with us: where there is one Catholick, there would have been ten: there had been no ſpeeches amongſt us of Racks and Tortures, nor any cauſe to have uſed them; for none were ever vexed that way ſimply, for that he was either Prieſt or Catholick, but becauſe they were ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have had their hands in ſome of the ſaid moſt traiterous deſignments: none of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62848:50"/>
enemies durſt ſo readily have attempted her State and Kingdom: we had been in better friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with thoſe that ſeek now moſt to oppoſe themſelves againſt us, and to all men (as we are perſwaded) <hi>bonus odor Chriſti, odor vitae ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam:</hi> whereas by following the ſaid new violent Spirits, <hi>quaſi turbae impellentes parietem,</hi> we are become <hi>odor mortis ad mortem, non ſolum iis qui pereunt, ſed etiam iis qui ſalvi fiunt.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us all turn over the leaf, and take another courſe, than hitherto we have done.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we do alſo further intreat and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, to conſider with your ſelves, the ſtate of the Seminaries beyond the Seas, as now they ſtand at the diſpoſition of the Jeſuits, and joyn together with us, that the ſaid Jeſuits may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the government and direction of them. It is too well known, how hotly they are addicted to the purſuing of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy: for the advancement whereof, (becauſe it tendeth to their own glory, being altogether Hiſpaniated and tranſported into thoſe humors, the better to reſemble and imitate their Founder and Father <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> a Spaniard) they will certainly never ceaſe to put in practice all the miſchief, they can either deviſe themſelves, or learn amongſt their company: which is, as they conſort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the very School of Machiavelliſm. In the which our joynt ſuit, if we cannot prevail, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth then, that you would be pleaſed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by us, not to ſend or ſuffer your children or friends to go beyond the Seas unto them, that ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62848:50"/>
they may be driven, if needs they will train up Youths to make them Traiters, to gather them up in other Countries, whereby they ſhall not be able ſo much to infect or endanger us. Beſides, we are fully perſwaded, that by this courſe, although at the firſt we be not heard, by reaſon of the might that the Jeſuitical faction are grown unto: yet his Holineſs, when he ſhall perceive it, and in the depth of his ſingular wiſdom conſider, what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience may come thereof, will eaſily be drawn to hearken unto us. Or howſoever (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt ſaith in another caſe) <hi>potens eſt Deus de lapidibus iſtis ſuſcitare filios Abrahae:</hi> though you never ſend your Sons or Friends beyond the Seas, to the ruinating both of your ſelves, and of your Country, if the Jeſuits ſhall ſtill have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of them: ſo ſay we that the Church lived before they were born, and needeth not for the advancement of her glory, any of their traiterous practices: but is able of her ſelf by the aſſiſtance of God, to raiſe up Prieſts out of our own Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and from among the Miniſters themſelves, remain they as yet never ſo ſtiff or hard againſt us. And thus commending both you and our cauſe to God, and our ſelves to your good favours, and charitable prayers, we take our leaves, and end this tedious diſcourſe, more profitable and pleaſing to God (we truſt) than acceptable or grateful to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which we can be but ſorry for.</p>

                  <head>REASONS why the Jeſuits hope that they ſhould partake of the favor ſhewed to other Prieſts, in taking away the Sanguinary Laws.</head>
                  <p>THE ſame Reaſons, which moved the Peers to take away the Sanguinary Laws from other Prieſts, may move them alſo, to take them away in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> for the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are free born Subjects as well as others; they have been as faithful to His Majesty as others; they are of tender Conſciences as well as others. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> all along have been furtherers of the King, and Actors alſo as far as their Function beareth; that is, they were in the Camp where ſome of them were killed, others impriſoned, most of them lost their neareſt Relations in the War, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all had their Friends undone for the King. All thoſe that depended on the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant for the King, even to death: amongst theſe were ſome ſignal perſons, as Sir <hi>Henry Gage,</hi> Sir <hi>John Smith,</hi> Sir <hi>John Digby,</hi> and others, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been formerly Scholars of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> were actually, when they dyed, Penitents of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:62848:53"/>
and Mr. <hi>Peter Wright</hi> who was executed at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> for a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> was particularly maligned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was Sir <hi>Henry Gage</hi> his Prieſt. As for Noble perſons who loſt great Eſtates, and endured much hardſhip for his Majeſty, the late Ducheſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the late Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Shrewſbury,</hi> were Penitents of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as other prime Nobility yet in being.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas two things are objected againſt the Jeſuits, they are both eaſily anſwered; Firſt, it is objected that the Jeſuits teach the Doctrine of the Pope depoſing Kings. It is anſwered, That no Community can be leſs accuſed of that Doctrine, than the Jeſuits. It's true, four or five Jeſuits did many years ago teach that Doctrine, as they had found it taught by others, ancienter than their Order. But ſince the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1616. the General of the Jeſuits forbade any of his to teach, preach, or diſpute for that Doctrine, or print any thing for it, to take away the aſperſion which the Writings of ſome few have brought upon the Society. And now actually all Jeſuits are obliged under pain of damnation, not to teach that Doctrine either in word, writing, or print, which none in the Church but they only are.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis objected that the Jeſuits do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly depend on the Pope. It is anſwered, That they are obliged by a particular Vow to be ready to go even to the utmoſt bounds of the Earth, to preach the Goſpel to Infidels, when the Pope ſhall think it fit to ſend them; and they have no other Vow, which doth particularly oblige them but this, which can prejudice no Kingdom. On the other
<pb facs="tcp:62848:53"/>
ſide, ſpeaking of their dependence (which may byaſs their affections) they have the leaſt dependence of the Pope, of any Church-men, for they are by ſpecial Vow excluded from all Benefices, and Dignities, by which the Pope may win the affection of other Church-men.</p>
                  <p>As for what is ſaid of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> baniſhing the Jeſuits, it is anſwered that both thoſe Eſtates have repealed their Acts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the Jeſuits being willing to ſubmit to whatſoever all other Catholick Prieſts ſhall agree to, and offering all the ſecurity which others offer, they hope they may be partakers of the ſame favours which ſhall be granted to others; that ſo, that mercy may extend to all, and the World may ſee that the Sanguinary Laws are truly taken away.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Expect Cenſures and Clamours as loud as can be againſt me, of uncharitable, uncatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, unchristian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſeeming to lay load upon the already oppreſſed, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to, and even provoke a perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Fellow Catholicks. I think I have ſaid my worſt againſt my ſelf: let me ſee how I can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie my action. Premiſing therefore that the caſe of you Jeſuits is apprehended by your ſelves, and your Abettors already deſperate, and your Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion remedileſs, and ſo cannot be ſaid to ſpring from this paper of mine; I addreſs to my Defence, and offer my Motives why I publiſh this little Treatiſe againſt you.</p>
                  <p>My firſt is, To wipe off the aſperſion laid upon Gods Church by ſome Tenets of yours; and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſtened on it by your haughty calling only your ſelves the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and all diſſenters from your <hi>Tenets,</hi> Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond, Becauſe I underſtand you are about to make the Common good ſtoop to the Particular one of your Order: as is your constant practice; contrary to the Law of Nature, and Principles of Chriſtianity. For I have been informed that you in a boaſting manner affirm, the Parliament will proceed no farther about taking away the Sanguinary Laws:
<pb facs="tcp:62848:54"/>
and that ſome friends of yours endeavour to make it believed that it is not for his Majeſties intereſt to make good his ſolemn promiſe from <hi>Breda,</hi> of having regard to tender Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>My third is, Your ſtomachful fruſtrating my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. For I was really glad when I heard you had publiſhed Apologetical Reaſons why you ſhould not be excepted; hoping you would ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the criminal Doctrines and Actions of your Predeceſſors, and free Religion from ſcandal. But finding no ſuch thing, <hi>per verba de praeſenti,</hi> but on the contrary, a comparing and preferring your ſelves before others: I thought my ſelf obliged to do right to the Common Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>My fourth, To oblige you to repentance, and a hearty retractation of your unlawful Tenets and Practices; that ſo you may deſerve and have as much favour as others; which is the worſt I wiſh you: and not to wrong your own Credits and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and fool others with diſſembling ſhews of loyalty, which every one may ſee to be mere hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
                  <p>My fifth, Becauſe I owe that duty to the Civil Magiſtrate, whoſe hearty Subject I am, to reſent a mockery put upon him (as this your paper will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be) under colour of offering ſatisfaction: Every true hearted Subject owing his beſt endeavour to his King and Country, that none lurk among them, unleſs their faltring Principles of Aequivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſloyalty be purged out.</p>
                  <p>My ſixth, To offer even your ſelves an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if your courage and cauſe will ſtretch to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it. For the following <hi>Doubts</hi> are, many of
<pb facs="tcp:62848:55"/>
them, ſuch as Proteſtants themſelves urge against your Reaſons: and are communicated here to you, partly on purpoſe that you may provide better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                  <p>My laſt (to ſatisfie even the paſſionate too) is, Becauſe your unchriſtian ſpirit of Calumny is ſtill as unquiet as ever; having, of late, moſt unjustly aſperſed Principal Perſons of almoſt every Body but your own; which comportment of yours makes it but fit, if Truth and the Common Good favour you not, neither ſhould I. To think and declare thus much ſatisfies me; if it do not others, I cannot help it. Only I wiſh your favourers to beware of doing any thing that may be interpreted an abetment of you, till you approve your ſelves heartily loyal; leſt they diſcover themſelves <hi>too deeply</hi> tainted with your Principles and temper.</p>

                  <head>The Jeſuits Reaſons Vnreaſonable. <hi>DO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BTS.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. TO begin then. My firſt Doubt ſhall be, Whether you <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have ground to hope the ſame favour with others. For, if you, by your unjuſt and wicked practices provoked the Magiſtrates to enact thoſe Laws: if the reſt of Prieſts and Catholicks were by you plunged in ſuch miſeries, upon diſcovery of your Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were imputed to the whole Body of them, how can you be thought to deſerve remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whoſe ſeditious Principles are too deeply guilty of the Blood of Prieſts and Catholicks ſhed in the Kingdom ever ſince you firſt came into it? Thoſe who know your practices in the Countries, where you, by the means, ordinarily, of deluded Wives, govern the Great Ones, know this to be your Maxime, to manage Religion, not by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, but by command and force. This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple did your chief Apoſtle of <hi>England, Robert Parſons,</hi> bring in with him. His firſt endeavours were to make a Liſt of Catholicks, which, under the conduct of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> ſhould have changed the ſtate of the Kingdom, uſing for it the pretence of the Title of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But, her Council at <hi>Paris,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood buſineſs better, were ſo ſenſible of his boldneſs, that they took from him the Queens Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher which he had purloyned, and commanded him never more to meddle in Her affairs. Poor <hi>Edmund Campian,</hi> who is generally accounted an
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62848:56"/>
innocent and learned man, and others ſuffered for ſuch practices of his.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Parſon</hi>'s endeavours being ſuppreſſed by this Queen, he turned himſelf to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and, with all his might, foſtered the <hi>Invaſion</hi> of <hi>Eighty eight,</hi> which is known to have been another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sanguinary Laws. He wrote, on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, his <hi>Dolman,</hi> to juſtifie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Title to <hi>England,</hi> degrading the Scottiſh ſucceſſion and Title of our Soveraign. He wrote alſo <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter's Common-wealth</hi> (at that time called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <hi>Blewcoat,</hi> becauſe it was ſent into <hi>England</hi> bound in blew paper) which extremely exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the State, and augmented its indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Catholicks. The ſame man, at Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> death, procured a <hi>Bull</hi> from the Pope to the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> againſt King <hi>James;</hi> to hinder his coming to the Crown, unleſs he would give liberty of Conſcience, and, as his friends gave out, had twenty thouſand men liſted for that effect, had not his Majeſty prevented the danger with ſweet words.</p>
                  <p>Next followed that deteſtable Machination of blowing up that Royal Race, and the whole No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, with the Houſe of Commons, which was the occaſion of the Oath of Allegiance, and all the Perſecution of Catholicks following upon it: King <hi>James</hi> profeſſing, not to perſecute for Religion, but for Treaſon. This you alledge not to be, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, your Invention; but, is it no guilt to follow another mans wickedneſs, when it leads to ſo horrid a crime? For, without doubt, both by prayers before-hand, and by publick teſtifications
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62848:56"/>
after the Fact was diſcovered, you were highly acceſſary to it: nay, many years after you did, and peradventure to this very day ſtill do perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly adhere to it. I could urge great and manifeſt inſtances of this, were it not to loſe time. That monſtrous <hi>Straw,</hi> of which all Chriſtendom rung ſo long, and the Pictures of <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne</hi> cannot be denied, nor want they evidence of your inward minds.</p>
                  <p>After theſe came out the ridiculous and ſatyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books againſt King <hi>James,</hi> the <hi>Corona Regia,</hi> and the <hi>Quaeries.</hi> And yet your ſo well affected ſpirits could not be at reſt, till your Patriarch <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> was ſhamefully turned out of <hi>Rome</hi> by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Bethunes,</hi> the French Ambaſſador, and order from the King of <hi>France;</hi> being diſcovered to plot a new Treaſon againſt his Country to introduce the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> Thus you followed King <hi>James</hi> to his death.</p>
                  <p>Direct Treaſon againſt King <hi>Charles,</hi> of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous memory, before the Wars, I cannot accuſe you of: but, how refractory you were to the Queens deſires and orders at <hi>Rome,</hi> for his late Majeſties aſſiſtance, is well known; and what you have done ſince the beginning of the Wars, and how you have behaved your ſelves, both in and out of <hi>England,</hi> is fitter for me to remit to his Majeſty, and the Courts Informations, than to e<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my pen in far fewer and weaker which I could produce. Only I ſhall add this word; If Colonel <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> were well examined and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he would perhaps diſcover <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ange ſecrets, about your treating with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> no doubt much
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62848:57"/>
to his Majeſties advantage. So that, leaving you this <hi>Doubt</hi> to ruminate upon, whether the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, who have guiltily provoked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Sanguinary Laws, be the ſame with theirs who have ſuffered for being miſtaken to be their Fellows; I proceed to</p>
                  <p n="2">2. My <hi>Second Doubt,</hi> about your firſt Reaſon. That <hi>the Jeſuits are free-born Subjects as well as others.</hi> In which, methinks, I find one of your uſual ſleights of <hi>Equivocation.</hi> For, a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> may ſignifie the man who is a <hi>Jeſuit;</hi> and may ſignifie, with the complexion of being a <hi>Jeſuit.</hi> In the former ſenſe there is no difference between any other Prieſt, Regular or Secular, and a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> as to free-born; but, in the ſecond, there's a wide one. For, the others have nothing againſt them, but ſuch Laws as had their beginning from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Religion: their degrees and communities having been accepted by the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; in virtue of which they are free-born Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and parts of the Common-wealth, as far as difference of Religion permits.</p>
                  <p>Now, it being the Law of <hi>England</hi> that no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Community may ſettle here, unleſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Civil Power, (as we ſee in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, practiſed in all Catholick Eſtates) and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> never having participated of this favour, all your practices of uſurping Juriſdiction, making Colledges and Provinces in or for <hi>England,</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing your ſelves of great ſums of monies for ſuch ends, and the like actions, have been hitherto all uſurpations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unlawful both in reſpect of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and Acceptors. 'Tis unlawful for any man
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62848:57"/>
(even according to the ſenſe and practice of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick times) by virtue of your priviledges, to live, or preach in <hi>England,</hi> or any of his Majeſties Dominions; and whoever entertains you in ſuch quality, is ſubject to the penalties ordained by the Ancient Laws. Neither, without ſome main Reaſon which might force the aforeſaid Statute, ought you to hope or attempt any further ſtay in <hi>England,</hi> in way of a Body, till firſt you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained particular grace from the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. My <hi>Third Doubt</hi> is, Whether <hi>you have been as faithful to His Majeſty as others;</hi> Which is your ſecond Reaſon. For which I muſt note a Maxim or Practice found among you <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all who look into your ways; which is, in quarrels of Princes and Great Men, to have ſome of your Fathers on one part, and others for the contrary. Which as I no ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be very politickly done, and to ſhew that you are <hi>Wiſer than the Children of light;</hi> ſo, on the other ſide, I affirm 'tis a manifeſt ſign you are faithful to neither. I ſpeak not this as to ſingle men, (if there be any among you who prefer your loyalty to your Prince before obedience to your Superiour) but as to the Community or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, who give this direction or connivence to their ſingle Subjects, to act on both ſides; by which they are convinced of acknowledging duty to neither, but to work for their own intereſts. Nor can the like be imputed to other Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whoſe obedience is more rational and free; without obligation to follow their Superiours
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62848:58"/>
Judgments further than to the obſervation of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Rules.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. My <hi>Fourth Doubt</hi> is, Whether you <hi>are</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>of tender Conſciences as well as others:</hi> (your third Reaſon) for which I remit him who deſires a further information, to <hi>The Mystery of Jeſuitiſm,</hi> tranſlated ſome years ſince out of <hi>French:</hi> The Author whereof is both learned in your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and an upright and ſcrupulous <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> as his Book manifeſts. Where every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader may ſee, as clear as noon-day, that your Conſcience is ſo tender as to ſtretch to all kind of Villanies, by the award of that Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Bawd, commonly called <hi>Probability,</hi> by which whatever three Divines hold (or, perhaps, one) is accounted <hi>Probable</hi> and lawful to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed: and whoever underſtands any whit of the world, knows your General can, with a whiſtle, raiſe whole Legions of Divines to ſpeak what he has a mind ſhould paſs for <hi>probable;</hi> nay, every Provincial can raiſe <hi>above three</hi> to make it <hi>de fide.</hi> The World has ſeen the experience, about <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Princes, Equivocations, mental Reſervations,</hi> and divers other juggles.</p>
                  <p>Although this ſeems enough for this point, yet it is not amiſs to add a Maxime of obedience which you have among you, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Subject ought blindly to obey his Superiour without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whenever it is probable there's no ſin in the action. Out of which perſwaſion, if three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at the moſt, ſay a thing may be done, which the Superiour will have done; 'tis not in a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects power, under pain of damnation, to refuſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62848:58"/>
to do it. Whereby 'tis plain, the tenderneſs of your Conſciences is only about doing or not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what your Superiour orders you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. My <hi>Fifth Doubt,</hi> concerning your Fourth Reaſon, is, whether all you ſay proves any hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his Majeſty. For, I queſtion not the truth of all this, but the <hi>Quaere</hi> remains, whether you <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were the firſt movers, or the Gentry which did the King ſervice, to whom you adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for not loſing your places, and intereſt you had in the parties. Had you pleaded that any of this Gentry which you name, was unwilling of himſelf, and his <hi>Jeſuit</hi> had <hi>induced</hi> him, or made him conſtant, when he would have relented, this reaſon had been ſomewhat ſtrong: now, 'tis one of the probable Arguments which are ſubject to be turned to what pleaſes the Orator.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak ſomewhat to particulars; 'Tis known <hi>Col. Gage</hi>'s relations were to others more than to you; and I could name by whoſe ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he took arms for the King, who was not of your Coat. As for Sir <hi>John Digby,</hi> there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live who know by whom he was armed, and ſent to the Kings Party, in whom you had not ſo great intereſt. Concerning the Noble Perſons you name, though you had the induſtry to make your ſelves their <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> yet were they not, for the moſt part, ſo addicted to you, that they had not great Relations to other Eccleſiaſtical Bodies. So that it may appear, their own inclinations, and not your perſwaſions (as far as is clear) were their motives to follow the Kings Party. I could ſay more, were it fitting to enter upon private mens
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62848:59"/>
particular actions. And ſo much to your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. My <hi>Sixth Doubt</hi> concerns the Anſwer to the firſt Objection, Whether <hi>Jeſuits</hi> teach <hi>the Doctrine of the Popes depoſing Kings.</hi> My Doubt is, what your Anſwer is, whether I or no? for I can find neither. Firſt, you compare your Body to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is no Anſwer to the Queſtion, but a ſpiteful and envious diverſion, to examine others actions, who are ſufficiently cleared, becauſe not queſtioned. Secondly, you tell us that ſome <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> did teach it; but that, <hi>ſince the firſt of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1616. <hi>your General has forbidden any of his, to teach, preach, or diſpute for that Doctrine;</hi> which anſwers not the Queſtion, and is a thing I am prone to believe. For I have been informed, that 'tis a known practice of your <hi>Society,</hi> that your Generals ſhould forbid ſome actions, which they are not unwilling their Subjects ſhould pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, to the end that they may reject weak men, by ſaying it cannot be true, becauſe they have a Rule againſt it; and to more underſtanding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they may excuſe the fault, by laying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect on Particulars, who will not obey their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>But, I muſt farther note a cunning in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. For true it is, the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the principal <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to get ſuch an order from their <hi>General,</hi> for <hi>France;</hi> upon which I ſuppoſe, you build your anſwer: not explicating whether it reaches to other Countries, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to <hi>England,</hi> which I never heard ſo much as pretended: and therefore it anſwers nothing to
<pb facs="tcp:62848:59"/>
the real Queſtion, unleſs you produce the extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the whole World; which you cannot do, ſince 'tis plain, <hi>Santarellus</hi>'s Book was printed in <hi>Rome</hi> about ten years after 1616. teaching the power of Depoſing in all latitude. Wherefore either <hi>Santarellus</hi>'s fact was a manifeſt diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the noſe of his General, or the anſwer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, an open Impoſture, making a ſpecial Decree for <hi>France</hi> a general one, and ſo your anſwer fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious and none. No more than your fair infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that all <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are bound <hi>under pain of Damnation,</hi> not to teach that Doctrine; which is a pure ſlur you uſe to put upon men unaccuſtomed to your ways: whereas 'tis a known poſition of yours, that none of your Rules bind under ſo much as a Venial ſin, much leſs under Damnation.</p>
                  <p>And it ſeems you think there's no Mortal ſin, but Diſobedience, or you eſteem the Doctrine good, though forbidden you, elſe you would not have added that Clauſe, that <hi>None in the Church but you, were bound under pain of Damnation, not to teach that Doctrine:</hi> whereas all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans think it damnable to teach any wicked Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſuch as this is declared to be by all <hi>France.</hi> I wiſh to God you would inſtance in what Sermons or ſerious Diſcourſes any of you have argued againſt this Doctrine; out of which it might be gathered, that in your hearts you diſlike it. I hear you and yours have much exclaimed againſt ſome even late Pamphlets that touch the Oath of <hi>Allegiance;</hi> though none of thoſe Books (as far as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) preſs the taking of the Oath it ſelf, in its preſent terms, but only oppoſe this King-dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62848:60"/>
Doctrine. Surely, unleſs you declare your ſelves farther, this muſt cauſe a main ſuſpicion, that you diſlike the Oath, not as Moderate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks do, for the ambiguity of the expreſſion, but becauſe the Doctrine of <hi>Depoſition</hi> pleaſes you.</p>
                  <p>And why ſhould the Peace of Kingdoms, and the quiet of all Chriſtendom depend upon your Generals Order, for that's all the ſecurity I can find your Paper gives us? who will aſſure us your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Order may not alter to morrow, and that which you call now a mortal ſin to do, becomes then as mortal a ſin not to do? and has not then the World reaſon to fear that, where and when the intereſt of your Body will either diſpenſe with your obedience to your General, or prevail ſo far with him as to revoke the Prohibition you ſpeak of, you will be ready again to maintain the ſame Depoſing Power with as much fierceneſs as thoſe few whom you now ſeem to diſowne?</p>
                  <p>For, who are thoſe few? <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> of whom one of your Society (though in Priſon when he ſpake it) ſaid, King <hi>James was no more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Bellarmine, than Balaams Aſs to Balaam: Suarez,</hi> whom you eſteem the Maſter of the World: <hi>Leſſius,</hi> under the name of <hi>Singleton: Fitzherbert</hi> the chief, in his time, of your Engliſh Writers: Patriarch <hi>Parſons, Mariana, Salmeron, Becanus, Vaſquez; Omnes Capita alta ferentes,</hi> and of whom you will renounce none for leſs than being frightned to loſe a Province; as when, in <hi>France,</hi> you were threatned to be put out, if you had not condemned <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Santarellus:</hi> With
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62848:60"/>
theſe deſerves to be ranked, for his Merits in the ſame kind, <hi>F. Symonds,</hi> of a far later date, who procured to be condemned at <hi>Rome</hi> thoſe three Propoſitions (expreſſed in the <hi>Chriſtian Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>) of which the firſt was expreſly made to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Popes power in abſolving Subjects from their Obedience to the Civil Government. Are all theſe but <hi>four or five?</hi> Nay, I could reckon above four or five beſides all theſe: ſo that, there is no farther ſecurity of your not preaching this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than until the Pope pleaſe to attempt again the Depoſition of ſome King of <hi>England:</hi> for then no doubt but your Generals Decree will be releaſed, and the Intereſt of your Order to preach this Doctrine again.</p>
                  <p>As to that perverſe and unſeaſonable inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Others, too, have defended the Popes depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power, as well as you:</hi> I anſwer, perhaps Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Errours may have prevailed ſo far with ſome others beſides <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> yet, with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the point we now treat: ſome perſons of other Communities have written for that exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant power in the Pope, and very many, and far more againſt it: not only the faculties of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> but ſeven or eight whole Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities in <hi>France,</hi> have unanimouſly and ſolemnly condemned it: All this while, what ſingle <hi>Jeſuit</hi> has ſpoken one unkind word againſt it? though both particularly ſuſpected, and highly concerned to clear themſelves. Cry you mercy! you there ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed alſo their Condemnation of it. But why find I not that alledged here, if there be not ſome juggle in't? Sure you would not have waved ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62848:61"/>
it among your beſt Reaſons, did not your hearts diſavow that forced compliance then, and ſo hate the <hi>Medium</hi> for the Concluſions ſake. Your Generals Prohibition (as your Reaſons ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it) is, <hi>Not to teach, &amp;c. that Doctrine;</hi> and then you are free, at leaſt to teach, &amp;c. the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; which who of you ever did ſo much as in a private Conference? Nor will it help you, if your Generals Prohibition be to ſpeak either <hi>for</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> that Opinion (which I believe is the truth, though your Reaſons craftily diſſemble it;) ſince then, you neither have hitherto given, nor can hereafter give the leaſt ſatisfaction to Princes, without diſobeying your General.</p>
                  <p>Let any one but caſt his eye upon <hi>F. Lloyd</hi> (or <hi>Fiſher</hi>) a famous man in his generation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he writes in his <hi>Anſwer to the Nine Points. That he omitted the diſcuſſion of the Ninth Point,</hi> about the Pope's Authority to depoſe Kings; <hi>for, being bound by the command of his General given to the whole Order, not to publiſh any thing,</hi> of that Argument, <hi>without ſending the ſame firſt to Rome, to be reviewed and approved; his Anſwer to that Point could not have been perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without very long expectation and delay.</hi> And ſo goes on; <hi>referring</hi> His Majeſty and the Reader in general, to the <hi>Treatiſes lately written on that Subject, to which,</hi> ſaid he, '<hi>Tis not needful any thing ſhould be added.</hi> And, I ask, firſt, is not this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits proceeding with his King extremely, both uncivil and diſloyal too? his Majeſty commands an Engliſh Jeſuit to write concerning <hi>the Opinion of depoſing Kings, and giving away their Kingdoms</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:62848:61"/>
                     <hi>by Papal power, whether directly or indirectly:</hi> What ſays the Jeſuit to this important queſtion, wherein all Princes, and particularly his Majeſty was ſo nearly concerned? He could not anſwer it without ſending it firſt to <hi>Rome</hi> to be approved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo excuſed himſelf, and made no anſwer at all; which now of theſe two will you gueſs was the Jeſuits ſupreme Soveraign, the King or his General? Nor ſhould I have ſtayed ſo long upon the example of one particular Jeſuit, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo eminent among them, but that by theſe their Reaſons, I ſee they all cleave to the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of not meddling with this point, whatever it coſts them, without leave of their General.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ask concerning thoſe late Treatiſes here mentioned by the Jeſuit; were they not thoſe very Books which <hi>Paris</hi> and ſo many whole Univerſities of <hi>France</hi> publickly condemned? I have this motive to think ſo; <hi>F. Fiſher</hi> wrote this Book 1626. theſe Treatiſes were that very year condemned, and ſome of them, as <hi>Santarellus,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but the year before. But, that <hi>F. Fiſher</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the affirmative of the Popes depoſing power, is clearly evident by his other excuſe, that <hi>commonly Kings are not willing to hear the proofs of coercive Authority over them, &amp;c.</hi> As alſo, when his Adverſary objected, that <hi>Suarez</hi>'s Book was burnt by the Hangman, he anſwers (far from diſliking his Brother <hi>Jeſuit</hi>) in theſe peremptory words; <hi>I likewiſe demand of you,</hi> ſays Fiſher, <hi>if Jeſuit Suarez his Book be prejudicial to Princely Authority, why is the ſame allowed in all other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Kingdoms, &amp;c?</hi> Does this ſound, as if the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62848:62"/>
                     <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had changed their inclination to that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; whilſt one of their eminenteſt Writers ſtrives thus to defend, nay, applaud, even <hi>Suarez,</hi> one of the moſt offenſive and extragavant, even, <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that ever medled with that Subject?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. My <hi>Seventh Doubt,</hi> is about <hi>your dependence on the Pope,</hi> which you gloriouſly explicate to conſiſt in this, that <hi>The Jeſuits are obliged by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Vow, to be ready to go even unto the utmoſt Bounds of the Earth, to preach the Goſpel to Infidels.</hi> I deſire to know, by what virtue you explicate your Vow in theſe words? the terms of your Vow are theſe, <hi>In ſuper promitto ſpecialem Obedientiam ſummo Pontifici circa miſſiones:</hi> which, by the tenour of the words, ſignifies to go whither he ſhall ſend you, and do what he ſhall command you in your Miſſions. Firſt, there's never a word of preaching the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor of <hi>Infidels;</hi> and your Miſſions may be as well to <hi>Catholicks</hi> as to <hi>Infidels;</hi> as we ſee the <hi>Peres de la Miſſion,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the moſt part, are imployed among Catholicks: and I would demand whether your Miſſion into <hi>England</hi> be not as well to Catholicks as to Proteſtants? Wherefore, by this Vow, you are bound to do whatever the Pope commands you: as for example, if the Pope ſhould excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate or depoſe the Prince, and command you to move the Catholicks to take Arms; you were bound by your Vow to do it. And, therefore, 'tis no wonder if you give the Pope a Catalogue of theſe men, and their qualities, (for they are, generally ſpeaking, thoſe who are eminenteſt in your Order) and brag to him how great an Army
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62848:62"/>
of Pens and Tongues you bring devoted to him, to further any attempt or deſign he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, is it not well known, that none of your Order go into Infidels Countries, but ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, whereof no ſmall part do it for diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they find in your Colledges? and that the Pope may as well ſend one of the Pillars of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> to preach to Infidels, as one of your profeſſed Fathers, if it be againſt your General's, and his own will? Therefore, this <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial obedience</hi> is but a flaſh of vanity above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; by which the Pope has a Chimerical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over you; ſuch as your ſubtilty in Divinity will call <hi>potentiaremota,</hi> which, without your own wills, ſhall never come into <hi>Act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet do I not think that His <hi>Majesty</hi> will quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with you for this Vow, as you explicate it: though, to tell you my ſence of it, I do not know how it ſtands with His Prerogative, that the Pope ſhall have power over his Subjects, which may be uſeful to him, to ſend them, without his leave, to <hi>Japan</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> But, this Authority you aſſume to your ſelves, and further: For, you do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige your Subjects to come in, or go out of the Kingdom, when you command them; but play the Judges of life and death, upon the Kings natural Subjects, without his leave, or any crime that, according to Civil Laws, deſerves puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You preſume by your power, to ſend them to <hi>Watten,</hi> or ſome ſuch place, wherein either your ſelves have high Juſtice, or the high Juſtice is at your Devotion, there frame Proceſs againſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62848:63"/>
them, and execute them, without making account to His Majeſty of the life of his Subject, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended crimes committed in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This (taking the whole ſtory together) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be no leſs than making your ſelves Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns over His Majeſties Subjects, that is, to be an Act of high Treaſon. Yet, all parts of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are evidently in your hands, in virtue of your obedience, and your having ſuch places of high Juſtice in your Command: ſo that your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have other Soveraigns than the <hi>King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> whom, by conſequence, they ought to fear more than him, ſince their power is more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, and preſſing and preſſed on their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. As for the practice, 'tis ſaid to have been uſed upon one <hi>Thomas Barton,</hi> an eminent Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar among you, who wrote a Book called <hi>The agreement of Faith and Reaſon.</hi> How true it is, I undertake not to juſtifie; but if you'l juſtifie your ſelves from High Treaſon, it behoves you to produce the man. And ſo you have my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth <hi>Doubt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. My <hi>Eighth Doubt</hi> is, that you equivocate with us in this word <hi>Dependence:</hi> for you turn it to be dependence by <hi>Vow,</hi> whereas more likely it means dependence of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and ſignifies, that 'tis your intereſt to ingage the Pope to you, by maintaining all height of Supreme Authority in him, though it be never ſo irrational and againſt Gods Law. For, by ſo doing, you alſo can uſe it all for your own Intereſt, in procuring for your ſelves and friends whatever lies either in the Popes Authority or Grace, as Exemptions, Priviledges,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62848:63"/>
Benefices, &amp;c. For, men look not on your Body as on others, whoſe Generals have no other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than according to their Rules, to look to their Diſcipline: But on you they look as on an Army managed by one man; whoſe Weapons are Pens and Tongues; and the Arts of Negotiation, and all plauſible means of commending your ſelves to the World. Which you exerciſe in ſuch a height, as to have had the boldneſs to threaten the Pope with a Schiſm; to tell the King of <hi>Spain</hi> your Tongues and Pens had gotten him more Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than his Armies; to attempt breaking the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of <hi>Venice;</hi> to be able to raiſe Seditions in moſt Countries; and to be dreadful to the very Kings and Princes. And all this, becauſe, as Chriſt propoſed to his Diſciples the love of one another, for the Badge of Chriſtianity; ſo, your Generals propoſe to you blind obedience for the Badge of a <hi>Jeſuit;</hi> that is, by cooperating with them, to make them powerful and great Lords and your ſelves invincible, and terrible to all that oppoſe you.</p>
                  <p>For this end you exalt the Popes <hi>Infallibility;</hi> that you may get your Opponents condemned in <hi>Rome,</hi> and then cry them down for <hi>Hereticks.</hi> For this reaſon you teach, the Pope to have <hi>all</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church, and other Biſhops to be but his Deputies, (ſo joyning with your Brother-Preſbyters in <hi>really</hi> deſtroying the Hierarchy) that, when you, by Grace or ſurreption, have purloyn'd a Command from that Court, you may treat all that reſiſt you, as Schiſmaticks and Rebels to the Church. Yet if we believe Mr. <hi>White</hi> (acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62848:64"/>
an able man) they are both damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and deſtructive of Faith and Church: and many others alſo of our moſt learned, diſlike them, though their courage, &amp;c. reaches not to brand them ſo ſeverely. In this complication of Intereſts, then, and not in your glorious Vow, conſiſts the dependence you have ſo ſpecially on the Pope, in a matter not of Religion, but of Temporal profit and greatneſs.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. My <hi>Ninth Doubt</hi> is, about the compariſon you make between your ſelves and others; telling us how you <hi>are by ſpecial Vow, excluded from all Benefices and Dignities, by which the Pope may win the affection of other Church-men.</hi> Concerning which I firſt inquire, whether this be roundly true? I doubt you'd be loth to reject all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys and Benefices annexed to your Colledges, to verifie this Vow, as you have ſet it down in your Paper: and therefore the effect of your Vow is only, that private men may not be alienated from your Order, with hope of quiet lives in ſuch Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices; and not the contempt of the Power, and Honour following it; as is ſufficiently teſtified by another Vow of yours; which is, that, if any of yours, for ſpecial reaſons, be made Biſhop, he ſhall be bound to be ſubject to the Provincial, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the place of his Reſidence, and to take their advice in the government of his Church; which you extend as far as to Cardinals, to a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of which <hi>Eminent Dignity,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>ſpecial Vow,</hi> your Diſpenſations eaſily reach. So that your Vow is no Religious one, of deſpiſing Honours; but a politick abuſe, mask'd
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62848:64"/>
under the veil of Religion, that the abler men of your Order may not be ſeparated from it, and ſo the Body may remain the ſtronger, and your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral more potent to reſiſt the Pope himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Neither does this any way diminiſh, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your dependence on the Pope; both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis by him your Houſes are furniſht with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, and thoſe never to return to the Popes Donation; as becauſe you oblige your Friends, by procuring others for them, you being at his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, to ſuggeſt this or that friend, on whom all his Benefices may be conferred: by which means you get the endearment due to the Pope from thoſe Friends, to the increaſe of your own power and riches; and your ſelves ſtill find out new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended neceſſities to beg more: So that this <hi>Holy Vow</hi> of yours no ways makes you leſs ſubject to the Pope, but to ſuck his paps the harder: as thoſe know, who have ſeen what paſſed in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> theſe late years; eſpecially under the <hi>Archduke Leopold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. Yet have I <hi>another Doubt</hi> concerning this <hi>Vow</hi> of yours, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it does not make you as refractory to Kings and Princes, as to the Pope? For to ſpeak truth, whatever the Right is in other Countries, in <hi>England,</hi> where the Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordates with the Pope have been out of uſe a hundred years, and by conſequence, have no force, even in your own Doctors opinions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore things are to be governed by Nature and Reaſon: at leaſt, in <hi>England,</hi> I ſay, all ſuch Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Collations belong more to the King than to the Pope. For, it being clear, that the Offices
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62848:65"/>
to which Benefices are annexed, are to be provided of able men; and who are able men none can tell that underſtand not the Office: 'tis plain, that Secular Clergy-men ought to be the chuſers of Officers of their kind, Regulars of Regular Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; and by conſequence, the Donors of ſuch Benefices.</p>
                  <p>But, the people firſt got an influence on the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Biſhops, becauſe 'twas rationally believed thoſe would be able to do moſt good, who were in the peoples good liking. But, when Biſhops grew to have great Revenues, and to be eſteemed men of ſo high Quality in the Common-wealth, the Emperors and Kings began to caſt an eye on their Election; and not without reaſon: for it concerns them that none be in eminent places, but ſuch as they are ſecured of will breed no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the Common-wealth. After this, if any Clergy-man had done the King ſervice, he found it the beſt way of recompence to cauſe him to be choſen into a place of Authority and Eminency. The Popes title to the giving of Benefices began by his Office of Patriach of the Weſt; which, ſince the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> he more narrowly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the government of; exhorting and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting by Letters ſuch Biſhops and Churches there, as did not their duties. And this held, till <hi>Pepin</hi> found how efficacious the reverence of the Pope was to make him obeyed, and accepted for <hi>King of France.</hi> Since which time, whether for Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for ſecurity ſake, men began to think no Act firm, unleſs it were ratified at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In times following, the Popes began to have
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62848:65"/>
need of Chriſtian Princes: and theſe found it the ſweeteſt way to help the Popes, by granting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon the Clergy. So came the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> to the Popes; and, to aſſure thoſe Incomes, the cuſtom of having <hi>Bulls</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to confirm the Elections of the Clergy, was likewiſe introduced. So that, this Authority of the Popes comes from the Princes Agreements with them, and not from any Superiority or Power of the Popes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, theſe Agreements being, by time and eſſential changes, annulled; all giving of Benefices belong to the Chuſers and the King.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the cloſe. If your renouncing of Benefices make you leſs ſubject to the Pope, as you pretend; it makes you in <hi>England</hi> leſs ſubject to the King. And, if it makes you more hardly rewardable, and more preſſing on the Pope, it will make you the like to Kings. As, in <hi>Leopold's</hi> time, you were ſo wholly the means for coming to <hi>Benefices,</hi> that hardly a command from <hi>Spain</hi> could take place for any that was not your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. My <hi>Eleventh Doubt</hi> is, how you anſwer your baniſhment out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> viz. that <hi>Both theſe States have repealed their Acts.</hi> Which anſwer makes nothing to this, that you either did not deſerve the ſentence, or deſerved to have it releaſed; one of which any judicious man would have expected at your hands. Now, to come to particulars; the <hi>Venetians</hi> were ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute againſt you, that they made it Treaſon for any of their State ſo much as to motion your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and refuſed divers Princes interceſſions for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62848:66"/>
you. Till their caſe reducing them to fear the ſlavery of the <hi>Turk,</hi> if they had not the Popes aſſiſtance, promiſed them largely if they would re-admit you: they rather choſe to ſtruggle with your Treaſons at home, than admit the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans conqueſt of their Dominions. Whether they have cauſe to repent, or not, I know not; But, the current news at this preſent is, that the Pope, who procured your admittance, has; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found you ſo unfaithful to him, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all his love to you, inſomuch that he's about queſtion you, by what means you are ſo ſuddenly raiſed to ſo great wealth: wherein, I fear, he'l not find obedience ſo ready as he found flattery, when he was to pleaſure you.</p>
                  <p>Your meaſure in <hi>France</hi> was, indeed, hard; the fault being not proved to be univerſal but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and ſo, in divers places, was never execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and eaſie to be repealed, having proceeded more out of preſumption than proof. But, your caſe in <hi>England</hi> is far different; your whole Engliſh Congregation following their Head, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and maintaining his Acts even ſince his Death.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. My <hi>Twelfth Doubt</hi> is, concerning your concluſion, Whether you intend to mend what, hitherto, you have done amiſs; or rather to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in your Equivocations and Diſſimulations. For, firſt, whereas you being the chiefly or only ſuſpected Body, are therefore bound to offer more ſatisfaction than others; you make your Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſubmit to whatever <hi>all other Catholick Prieſts ſhall agree to:</hi> which ſounds as much as, if
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62848:66"/>
any diſagree, you will adhere to them; or, in plain terms, that you'l agree to no more than by ſhame you ſhall be forced to, for not plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing the worſt of Prieſts and Enemies to the Catholick Cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. My <hi>Thirteenth Doubt</hi> is, why you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be the greateſt Divines among Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, remit your ſelves to the determinations of others, and not, as good Subjects ought, examine what ſatisfaction is neceſſary and fit to be given the State; and both offer it your ſelves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke others to do it, not ſtanding ſo ſcrupulouſly upon your Generals decree, which ſurely ſhould not be thought to bind in ſuch extreme caſes: even the Laws of the Church, and of general Councils we know oblige not, where our obedience would ruine us; and will you ſtill more preciſely obſerve your own By-Laws, than the ſacred Canons of the Univerſal Church? Methinks therefore, in due ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction concerning the pretences of the Pope againſt the King; whatever Catholick Doctors hold favourable to Princes, in theſe differences, ſhould by you be gathered together, and ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and promiſed to be maintained with all your power. As, firſt, the Doctrine, which denies that the Pope has any Authority in any caſe to depoſe, or temporally moleſt the King, or any of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Subjects. Likewiſe that he has no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to releaſe any lawfully made Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, or other promiſe to his Majeſty, or any of his Subjects. And, becauſe none of theſe, or the like aſſertions can be ſtrong and firm in the mouth of him that holds the Pope's <hi>Infallibility</hi> in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62848:67"/>
points of Faith; but, whenever the Pope ſhall determine the contrary, he muſt renounce what before he held for good: therefore you ſhould do the like in reſpect of the <hi>Pope's Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, becauſe, if the Pope, by his own, or any others Authority, may force his Majeſties Subjects to go into Countries where they cannot enjoy the protection of their Prince, the Subjects are not free to maintain theſe aſſertions: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this Poſition, alſo, that a <hi>Subject of England is bound to appear before any foreign Tribunal, without His Majeſties conſent,</hi> is alſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Nor is it leſs neceſſary you ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly renounce the Doctrines of <hi>Equivocation</hi> and <hi>Mental Reſervation;</hi> without which all the reſt afford very little ſecurity; And I could wiſh you would find ſome way how to aſſure us, that, when you ſolemnly make your diſclaim of theſe laſt Opinions, you do not practiſe them even while you renounce them. Unleſs ſuch Tenets be ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed out of the heads and tongues of your Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, there cannot be expected any hearty Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the <hi>Jeſuited Party,</hi> whoſe conſciences are governed by you; but ſuch a one as ſhall waver with every blaſt from <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither can any Prieſt exempt himſelf from ſubſcribing the condemnation of all theſe. For, Ignorance of neceſſary truths is not to be allowed in Teachers. And, ſuppoſing that every one knows the Propoſitions are not Articles of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, the manifeſt Inconveniences that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, will evidently convince they are to be

condemned. For, temporal ſubjection to Princes is the main ground of the peace and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common-wealth; and what is againſt that, is againſt the Law of God and Nature.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould think it, therefore, not ſo much your beſt, as your only way, to lay aſide your private Intereſts with the Pope, and declare your ſelves not the laſt, but the forwardeſt in your Allegiance to His Majeſty, that you may cancel your former proceedings, and blot out the ſetled Opinion of your Diſſimulation. You can do it, if you will; for you teach men to depoſe their own private conſciences on the Opinions of others. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but the contrary Opinions are aſſerted by Catholick Doctors; and therefore by your own Maximes, 'tis lawful for you to hold them, nor will I now diſpute thoſe Maximes. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you deeply; for, you muſt have a <hi>ſpecial</hi> favour from the Civil State: and not to pretend to ſuch, is to profeſs you break the Catholick Parliament's Statutes, and preſs the Popes exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Authority, and draws all your adherents into Treaſon before God and a <hi>Praemunire</hi> by the Laws. Think therefore ſoberly, and conclude ſtrongly what you have to do: and, let not your General's Intereſt overſway Truth and Juſtice, and your private Good.</p>
                  <p>Yet one reflection occurs to me worth your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, riſing from the Report I toucht at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, That you, ſeeing your ſelves ſhut out from the Favour Voted by the Houſe of Lords, to other Catholicks, are caſting about how to ſtop the progreſs of that Vote, and prevent its
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62848:68"/>
growing into an Act. Whereupon I raiſe this <hi>Quaere,</hi> why you, who are but a particular Body, ſhould not rather take up your roots and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant; than ſo to ſeek your private benefit, that you care not to hazard the whole? Do you not remember how and why you went from <hi>Venice?</hi> you voluntarily departed in pure Obedience to the Pope, upon a quarrel betwixt Him and that <hi>State;</hi> and were only kept out, not ſent away: And, were it not now as high a Charity, and as much for your reputation, to yield for a time, till your own deportments ſhall deſerve your reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to which nothing can more conduce, than your peaceable departure, eſpecially where the circumſtances are ſo different: When you left <hi>Venice,</hi> you were conceived to hope a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, by the Popes Arms and Triumph over your own Country; whereas, if you now go away, your departure will be abſolutely free from the blemiſh of that ſuſpicion, and remain to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity an Action of pure Heroick Vertue; while, in ſo tender a caſe, you prefer the publick before your own preſent private good. You who could leave a Country, where you were rich and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, meerly to comply with the Pope; can you not now depart from a Country, where your ſelves ſay, you are poor and afflicted, for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good of Religion? Elſe, will not this pitch of Reluctance ſavour too rankly of the rich glue which indeed faſtens your hearts here; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray at length to the inquiſitive, that your yearly Rents got by the Miſſion in <hi>England,</hi> are more than ten times as much as what belongs to all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62848:68"/>
Miſſions beſides, both Secular and Regular?</p>
                  <p>Only this word more: I ſhall deſire you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the Catholicks of <hi>England,</hi> nay of all the World, will be ſcandalized and provoked againſt <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> if they ſee you palpably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably drive on your own Intereſt alone, without caring what becomes of Religion, unleſs you may have your wills. This I propoſe, only upon ſuppoſition, that the Report is true. For, if you endeavour no more than to procure your ſelves may be included in the Act, without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering your Neighbours, I heartily wiſh you may prove it juſt: but, bethink your ſelves well of this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> If your ſolicitings ſtop the progreſs of the Act, how will you be hated, as guilty of the continuance of thoſe Sanguinary Laws? if your endeavours do not ſtop it, how will you be both hated for attempting it, and ſcorned for miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in't?</p>
