            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Case of <hi>Thomas Sherley</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of his Majesties Physitians in Ordinary.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Thomas Sherley</hi> the Elder, the Plantiffs great Grandfather was seized in Fee of the Mannor of <hi>Wiston,</hi> and divers other Mannors and Lands in the County of <hi>Sussex,</hi> to the yearly value of more then three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds. The said Sir <hi>Thomas Sherly</hi> half a year before his Death, did by Indenture bearing date the 29 <hi>Novemberis, nono Iacobi.</hi> Settle the said Mannors upon himself and Dame <hi>Anne</hi> his Wife during their lives, and after their Decease to Sir <hi>Thomas Sherley</hi> his Eldest Son the Plantiffs Grandfather for Life, and after his Decease to <hi>Henry Sherley</hi> the Plantiffs Uncle for Life, and after his Decease to the Sons of the said <hi>Henry</hi> successively in Tayl male; And for default of such issue to <hi>Thomas Sherley</hi> afterwards Sir <hi>Thomas Sherley</hi> the Plantiffs Father (and Brother to the said <hi>Henry</hi>) for Life, and after his Decease to the first, second, third, and fourth sons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the said <hi>Thomas</hi> in Tayl male; And the Plantiff as only son of the said <hi>Thomas,</hi> by vertue of the said Settlement is alone entitled to the said Estate.</p>
            <p>But divers Persons having got into Possession of the said Mannors are combined together to defraud the Plantiff and especially one Sir <hi>Iohn Fagg,</hi> who is got into possession of the chief Mannor, and a house that cost three and thirty thousand Pound building, as the Plantiff is informed, and several Lands and Tenements, to the value of Eight hundred Pound <hi>per annum</hi>: As the Plantiff verily believes And also for ten pounds in Money, and a Horse or Mare, worth six: Hath gotten into his Custody by the delivery of one <hi>Francis Whatker,</hi> the said Deed of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, without which the Plaintiff cannot recover his Estate from the said Sir <hi>Iohn Fagg,</hi> nor other Lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the said Settlement.</p>
            <p>The Plaintiff hath sued Sir <hi>Iohn Fagg</hi> by English Bill, in the High Court of Chancery for discovery of the said Deed, to which he put in a Plea to the said Bill before the then Lord Chancellor: the Substance whereof is only that he is a purchaser of the said House and Lands, for the Consideration of Six thousand Eight hundred pounds; which he calls a valuable Consideration, though in truth he derives no Title from any of the Plaintiff's Ancestors, nor denyes notice of the Plantiff's Title. And yet the said Plea being argued the Court allowed of the same, and dismissed the Plantiff's Bill out of Chancery, which dismission is signed and Inrolled, whereby the Plantiff is Ruined, and left without remedy either at Law or Equity, to recover his estate of three thousand pound <hi>Per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>; gotten from him as a foresaid, without any manner of Consideration either to him or any of his Ancestors under whom the Plantiff claims. And for want of the said Deed, the Plantiff hath no way to obtain relief, or compel the said Sir <hi>Iohn Fagg,</hi> to produce the said Settlement without his Address to the Right Honourable the house of Lords, the supream Court of Equity.</p>
            <p>Now the said Decree of Dismission of the Plantiffs Bill out of Chancery being very Erroneous, and the matter of Fact being mistated and there being many Errours in Fact in the said proceedings for which the said Decree and Order of Dismission ought to be reversed, and as the Case stands the Plantiff cannot maintain or assign any Bill of Reveiw for the same in the Court of Chancery according to the strict Rules of that Court the Plantiff hath therefore by Petition Appealed from the said Decree and Order of dismission to the Right Honourable the House of Lords where he hopeth the same will be examined and Revers'd</p>
            <p>The substance of the Plantiffs desires are, that their Lordships would be pleased to cause the said Deed of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement to be produced before them and restored to the Plantiff, and to do him what further Justice their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships in their great Wisdom shall think fit; to which the Plantiff submits both himself and cause.</p>
