            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

both storme and shot; such Merchandise being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkt therein, as may prouoke the whole Fleete of Spirituall and Ecclesiasticall Merchants (Pirates rather, floating euery where vpon the Catholicke, yea Narrow Seas, and not suffering any, bound for the <hi>Holy-land,</hi> to passe, but such as will Trucke and Trade with them) to surprise and prey vpon me. I know the <hi>Cause</hi> is good, though I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Actor</hi> weake. And although this be a kind of fruit, naturally sharpe and tarte (especially to aguish palates, and queasie stomackes) as also accidentally, for want of a good season to giue it a competent ripenesse; hauing, since first it began to bud, growne slowly by succisiue and intermissiue howers, borrowed from my Court-seruice, and my Church Cure; and, till now, lyen close couered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the late Frostie barren Winter, now reuiued, as the Plants with the vernall Sunne: it cannot chuse but receiue a great addition of ripenesse and rellish, if (besides the vniuersall influence of this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table season) it inioy but a speciall reflection of your <hi>HIGHNESSE</hi> gracious Countenance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.

            <p>And heere giue mee leaue, most Gracious <hi>PRINCE,</hi> to relate a pithie, and pious exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that learned and godly Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> to Queene <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> of blessed memorie, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like occasion. A speech, which because it doth immediately and primarily reflect vpon his <hi>MAIESTIE</hi> her happie Successor, I canot wish a worthier <hi>Iewell,</hi> then your <hi>HIGHNESSE,</hi> to recommend it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O that your Grace did behold the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable disorder of Gods Church, or that you might foresee the calamities, which will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low! It is a part of your Kingdome, and such a part, as is the principall proppe and stay of the rest. I will say to your Maiestie, as</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus <hi>sometimes said to the godly Emperors,</hi> Theodosius <hi>and</hi> Valentinian: Ab ea, quae erga Deum est, pietate, reipublicae vestrae status pendet. <hi>You are our Gouernour, you are the Nurse of Gods Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We must open this griefe
<pb facs="tcp:7450:4"/>
before you. God knoweth if it may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed, it is run so farre. But if it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed, there is no other besides your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that can redresse it. God hath indued your Grace with many graces and fauours: O turne and imploy these to the glorie of God, that God may confirme in your Grace the thing, which he hath begun. To this end hath God placed Kings and Princes in their State, as</hi> Dauid <hi>saith,</hi> That they serue the Lord, that they may see, and cause others to see to the furniture of the Church. <hi>The good Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> Iustinian <hi>cared for this, as much as for his life.</hi> Constantine, Theodosius, <hi>and</hi> Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>and other godly Princes, called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues</hi> Vasallos, <hi>the subiects and bond ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. They remembred that God furnished them in their houses, and were not vnmindfull to furnish his house.</hi> Thus and much more this good Bishop, to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And turning himselfe to the Assembly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also reproued Sacriledge and Symonie imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, he addeth those words: <hi>Haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, if any such bee here, as I well know there are, whom these things touch. Suffer me to speake the truth, it is Gods cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The liuings of such as are in the Ministerie, are
<pb facs="tcp:7450:4"/>
not in their hands, to whom they are due, All other Labourers and Artificers, haue their hire increased double as much as it was wont to be: onely the poore man that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and sweateth in the Vinyard of the Lord of Hostes, hath his hyre abridged and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I speake not of the Curates, but of the Parsonages and Vicaridges, that is, of the places which are the Castles and Towres of fence for the Lords Temple. They seldome passe now a dayes from the Patron, if he be no better then a Gentleman, but either for the Lease, or for present money. Such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are broken into the Church of God, a great deale more intollerable then were they, whom Christ whipped and chased out of the Temple. Thus they that should bee carefull for Gods Church, that should be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons to prouide for the Consciences of the People, and to place among them a learned Minister. who might be able to Preach the word vnto them, out of season and in season, and to fulfill his ministerie, seeke their owne, and not that which is Iesus Christs: They serue not Iesus Christ, but their belly. And this is done not in one place, nor in one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but throughout England. A Gentleman
<pb facs="tcp:7450:5"/>
cannot keepe his house, vnlesse he haue a Parsonage or two in Farme for his prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. O mercifull God! whereto will this grow at last? If the misery, which this plague worketh, would reach but to our age, it were the more tollerable; but it will be a plague to the posteritie, it will bee the decay and deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Gods Church, and it.</hi> So this good Bishop.</p>
            <p>It needes no application. Onely let mee craue leaue to Petition your <hi>HIGHNESSE,</hi> that you would be pleased to sollicite his sacred <hi>MAIES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE</hi> for two things. The first is: that a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent proportion may bee allotted out of euerie Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation (especially where the Vicaridge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed is incompetent or none at all) for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a sufficient Minister. The second is, that some remedie may be vsed, for the more exact pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of Simonie. These are two things well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming our great <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> His wisedom can best giue direction, and his authoritie life, to <hi>Acts</hi> of such difficultie. The great Ship of <hi>Good hope,</hi> hauing those two goodly Deckes, the <hi>Vpper</hi> and the <hi>Lower,</hi> so well Man'd, so well Rigg'd, hauing such a wise experienced Pilot, as his <hi>MAIESTIE,</hi> to command; such a Masters Mate as your <hi>HIGHNESSE,</hi> to perswade; such

vnanimous Mariners to obey the becke of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, what Fort of vice shall withstand her ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>terie? What force or fraude of foes shall dare to affront her, or be able to board her? What Port of friends will not open its <hi>amplissimum sinum,</hi> to intertaine free Trafficke with her? What Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriator will not freely come in, and returne a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall share into Gods Sanctuarie? What Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist shall dare to shew his head, much lesse his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hands, where once his <hi>MAIESTIE,</hi> and that Honourable Court of Parliament, haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the contrarie? Yea, what not? What so happie, that we may not hope? Or what so iust, which the grand Aduersarie, euen Satan himselfe may not feare? if these hopefull beginnings may but attaine to a faire conclusion. And Satans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice shall neuer be able to preuent it, if our sinnes doe not. The Lord blesse his <hi>MAIESTIE</hi> with many happie halcyon-dayes, &amp; blesse your <hi>HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES</hi> in a daily growth of Grace, and loue of the Truth, that the estate of this Church &amp; Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth may flourish vnder the King, and his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all off-spring in all peace and truth, vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Iesus Christ. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, as this small Treatise is generally intended for the good of Gods Church: so in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular there is no man of what degree or estate soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whom it may not in some sort or other neerely concerne, to entertaine it into his most serious consideration. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amongst men more common, then to to buy and sell. And lightly sinne is the Stickler or Broker betweene both. <hi>It is naught, saith the buyer</hi>; It îs pure good, saith the seller: when both the simulation of the one, and the dissimulation of the other, is the worst part of the commoditie. Yet I speake of such commodities, as are a lawfull Mart, and Market-able, as we say; I speake not of stollen goods, whereof the very actuall buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and selling is vniust; and proues euen
<pb facs="tcp:7450:6"/>
dangerous to the Parties, often Fellonious. If therefore euery man should bee carefull not onely (in regard of Gods law) how, but (also of mans Law) what he buy or sell in the open Markets or elsewhere, though it bee a thing of common prise: How much more then in such things, as are not of a common nature, and the very act of buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereof is questionable for the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, or rather out of question vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Of such things onely I would heere warne all buyers and sellers; no lesse then if a man proscribing his house to sale, should cause to be proclaimed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cic. Offic. lib.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>Domum pestilentem vendo,</hi> I would sell a house infected with the Plague. Yet such a house may come to bee purged again. But if a man should proclaime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I sell a House or Land, hauing a crackt Title, the sale whereof I cannot warrant to bee good (which too many can make sale of, without proclaiming any such thing) where would he finde a Chapman to giue him his prise, vnlesse such, whose braines were as crackt, as his Title is. Or if a man wittingly sell, and another ignorantly buy a crackt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it is but so much dammage to the one, but how great damnation to the other! But
<pb facs="tcp:7450:7"/>
loe I warne you here of a House, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and title whereof is worth the inquiring after, before wee goe about to buy it. This house is Gods house. Which, if it be infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Pestilence, consider; if the Title of it, and of the Demaines be crackt, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of sale, consult. It is a speciall case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; for resolution wherof, I intreate thy paines and patience in the perusing of this small Treatise. Reade it, as I haue writ it, for conscience, and not for curiositie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I take not vpon me to determine, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue impanelled a graund Iurie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and learned Doctors, whose ioynt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict is here deliuered. Nor haue I hookt in all the out branches, that the Learned haue obserued to grow from the same Tree of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; I haue gathered onely the maine, leauing the remaines for Gleanings.</p>

               <hi>Ob.</hi> But many one will say, what is this to me? This is a subiect out of the common Road-way of my Reading. I am no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, saith one: I am no Patron, saith another; &amp;c. and therefore what is Simonie to me?</p>
            <p>I answere (as I said before) I know no man of what condition soeuer, whether hee be high or low, rich, yea or yet poore, whom

this Treatise doth not either directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, or else indirectly and by way of necessarie consequence concerne. As for all Patrons, it concernes them directly: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes all Ministers directly, whither actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Ministers, or such as deuote their minds that way. It concernes all other persons, such as are neither Patrons, nor yet capable of the Ministerie, if any haue but children and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to bestow on them; that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with this little Booke, whither it be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, or no (as the too common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of the world is) to lay out his money for a Benefice for his Sonne. Yea, it may concerne all such Courtiers, or Noblemens Stewards, or great Officers Clerkes or Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, who though they be no Patrons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, yet perhaps haue some facultie to deale as Patrons. If any Reade, and reape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profit hereby, either by preuenting what may bee misdone, or by repenting of what is done, I haue my desire and reward. And for this <hi>Censure of Simonie,</hi> if it must needes procure the Simonists censure, let him turne the edge the right way, vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, not vpon me; except he had rather in malice cut me, then in mercie cure himselfe.</p>

               <p>Now if the former Definitions seeme too large; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to such, as would faine packe vp all <hi>Simony</hi> in the same fardell, with the gifts of the Holy Ghost, as Commodities of one and the same kinde: to gratifie these, we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce All to the same termes, and say, <hi>Simony is a Desire or Act of buying or selling the gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> So Master <hi>Caluin (in Act.</hi> 8.) approues this to be the most proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Simony. Onely the Question is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caluin. in Act.</hi> 8.</note> what kindes of gifts of the holy Ghost may bee here implied, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing and Chafering whereof, either is, or may well be called either <hi>Simony,</hi> or at least a branch of it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lyra. in Act.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Lyra (in Act.</hi> 8.) saith, <hi>Simon volebat emere potestatem dandi Spiritum Sanctum, intentione Lucri inde recipiendi: propter quod ab ipso nominatur vitium Simoniae, quo aliquis vendit aut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Aug. in Iob. Tract.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Quod venderet, emere volebat. He would buy that, which he purposed to sell againe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For which respect from him is named the sinne of <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>; when any man buyeth or selleth Spirituall things. Now wee may reduce all those gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Ministers (for these onely are pertinent to our purpose in hand) to these two heads: either those gifts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by imposition of hands in Ordination, whereby Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters receiue a ministeriall power to preach the Word, to administer the Sacraments, to remit and retaine sins, which is the dispensation of the Keyes: Or else those, whereby a Minister receiueth a particular Charge ouer this or that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7450:11"/>
flocke, which being done by canonicall and orderly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it is a <hi>gift</hi> no lesse ascribed to the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> then that other of Ordination. So the Apostle expresseth in his charge to the Clergie of Ephesus (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.) Take heed to your selues, and to the whole flocke of God, Whereof the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath made you <hi>Episcopos,</hi> or Ouerseers. See here, to be an Ouerseer, whether <hi>Episcopus,</hi> by a note of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, as the Superior Ouerseer, or Superintendent ouer all particular both flockes and Pastors in his peculiar Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: Or else euery inferiour and subordinate Minister in his seuerall Parish,<note place="margin">

                  </note> placed as an Ouerseer or Watch-man ouer his flocke, as <hi>Lyra</hi> also vnderstandeth. This is <hi>the gift of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Now then to buy this <hi>gift,</hi> to be made a Bishop ouer such a See, or a Pastor, or Rector of such a flocke, doth it not iumpe with this definition of <hi>Simony? For Simony is a trucking of the gifts of the holy Ghost: but such an Ouerseership is a gift of the Holy Ghost. Therefore to buy this gift, is Simony.</hi>

But as <hi>Sampson,</hi> after his lockes were shauen, neuer thought that his strength was gone, till by wofull proofe he found it: So our <hi>Simon</hi> here, thinkes all is well with him, so long as he strongly imagineth that his Tythes are but Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls; and so long, no Simonist, not <hi>as other men.</hi>

               <p>But now <hi>Sampson,</hi> the Philistins bee vpon thee; yea, stronger then the Philistins, A Troope of Truths doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set thee. What? Tythes temporall? In what Grammer haue you learned to ioyne this Substantiue and Adiectiue together? I am sure not in Gods Booke? There is no such incongruitie, no <hi>Solecisme,</hi> no false construction there. There he deserues the Feruia, the Rod, a <hi>vae,</hi> that incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously calls sower, Sweet: and Sweet, Sower; Good, Euill: and Euill, Good: And shall hee escape, that calls Sacred, Secular? Tythes, Temporalls? Or he, who saith, Giue vnto <hi>Caesar</hi> the things that are Gods? Let mee but a little shake <hi>Aarons Rod,</hi> and <hi>Christs many-corded Whip,</hi> at our indisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined <hi>Simon,</hi> to make him at least attentiue to what the Scripture saith. <hi>Tythes,</hi> I am sure, were once Sacred; and what God hath once <hi>Sacred,</hi> call not thou Common. But when Sacred? When? Why not, when <hi>Adam</hi> was first Created? When hee was endued with the ten Moralls of the Law? And is it not more then probable, that among the ten, the Lord allotted a Tythe, for the maintenance of his seruice: Seeing among the ten hee appointed a time for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7450:13"/>
his seruice, euen the Sabbath Day, the Sanctification whereof, Tythes were properly to attend vpon? Tythes then, no doubt, were sacred from the beginning of <hi>Adams</hi> creation. For else, when did <hi>Abraham</hi> learne to pay tythe of All to <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> the Priest of the most high God? Or what moued <hi>Iacob</hi> to vow the paying of Tythes? Was it onely from the Example of his grandfather? Or were his Tythes onely voluntary and arbitrary, till by vow made necessary? Why not then his other seruice, which he then vowed, which he was bound to performe, though hee had not vowed it at all? His vow was but a stronger Bond to hold and helpe him, to the better performance of that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which notwithstanding was due without a vow. As our solemne vow in Baptisme is but a stronger Bond to tye vs to that obedience to God, which wee ought most carefully to performe, no lesse, then if wee had not vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all.</p>
               <p>But if as yet you deny Tythes to bee Consecrate and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, by diuine instinct or institution, as wanting expresse precept: yet at least you your selfe cannot but confesse they began then to be sacred, when God said (<hi>Leuit.</hi> 27.30.) <hi>All the Tythe of the Land, both of the Seed of the ground, and the fruit of the Trees, is the Lords; it is holy to the Lord.</hi> Yea, so <hi>holy,</hi> so <hi>sacred,</hi> that (as in the next Verse) <hi>If any man shall redeeme any of his Tythe, he shall adde the fifth part thereto. And euery Tythe of Bullocke, and of Sheep, and of all that goeth vnder the Rod, The tenth shall be holy vnto the Lord, v.</hi> 32. Yea, so <hi>holy,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>He shall not looke if it be good or bad, neither shall he change it, else if he change it, both it, and that it was changed with all, shall be holy, and it shall not be redeemed.</hi> Loe then, how sacred Tythes bee ratified by a double Tense, They are holy, and, They shall bee holy to the Lord: As <hi>Iacob</hi> confirmed his sonnes blessing, I haue blessed him, and hee shall bee blessed.

                  <hi>that they which preach the Gospel, should liue of the Gospel.</hi> Who seeth not, that the Apostle there, doth paralell the Leuiticall maintenance, and the Lords Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the Altar, and the Gospel together. And doth not the Apostle there challenge to himselfe <hi>a power</hi> in such maintenance, as well as others? Marke; <hi>a power.</hi> And whence, but from the <hi>Lords Ordinance?</hi> And where appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the generall practise of this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> but in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall</hi> Maintenance? And where hath this Maintenance the first foundation and institution (besides the Creation) but in <hi>Christ,</hi> figured in <hi>Melchisedech, who receiued Tythes of Abraham,</hi> the father and figure of all the <hi>faithfull,</hi> the Church of God? And shall not Tythes then be for euer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred? And if sacred, is not hee a prophane Simonist, that offereth to <hi>buy</hi> them? Yea moreouer, are not the Ministers of the Gospel called the sonnes of <hi>Leui? Mal.</hi> 3.3. The text is pregnant, and plaine, and Interpreters subscribe to the truth of it. Christ was <hi>to fine the sonnes of Leui, that they might offer to the Lord in righteousnesse</hi>; that is, his Apostles and Disciples of the Gospel. These are called <hi>the sonnes of Leui,</hi> because they succeed <hi>Leui,</hi> in the <hi>Ministry.</hi> And if we be <hi>Leuies sonnes,</hi> who shall deny vs <hi>Leuies inheritance</hi>; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee are Leuites to the same Lord, the perpetuitie of whose Priesthood, the paiment of Tithes to his Leuites are a pregnant argument of. And if yee deny him <hi>Tithes,</hi> you must of necessity deny him the <hi>Priesthood</hi> too, &amp; so with the Iewes conspire to <hi>kill him, that the inheritance may be yours.</hi> Yea, we are <hi>Leuies sonnes, fined and purged</hi> from the <hi>refuse of Legal Types and Ceremonies:</hi> &amp; shal our <hi>Tythes</hi> be lesse <hi>sacred?</hi>

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some will say: Wee haue no expresse Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the Gospel for paying of Tythes. I answere, There are demonstrations enow, and those most strong. But what needs any expresse Precept? The Precept is expresse enough in the Law. He that is more seene in the Law, then in the Gospel, and stands more vpon Antiquities, then Verities; If the God of this world had not blinded his eyes, might acknowledge the antiquitie of this Precept in the Law to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7450:15"/>
be so plaine, as it needs no further explication or reestabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Gospel. The <hi>Tythe is the Lords,</hi> saith the <hi>Law.</hi> And doth not the <hi>Gospel</hi> ratifie the same, saying, <hi>Giue vnto God those things that are Gods?</hi> Is not this an expresse <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> Indeed Christ and his Apostles being busie in foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a new Church, suspended the practice of receiuing Tythes, vntill the decrepite Synogogue of the Leuiticall Ordinance expired, and the finall obsequies thereof were fully ended. But they left abundant euidence in their Gospels, to euict the right of Tithes to Christs Ministers, in the succeeding ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, That Tythes and all Church maintenance (call it what you will) <hi>benefit,</hi> or <hi>Benefice, profits,</hi> or <hi>corporall goods,</hi> they are <hi>holy,</hi> and of a spirituall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because they are consecrate to a holy vse: I doe not say, that <hi>Res decimarum,</hi> the things whereof Tythes consist, are in their owne nature spirituall: but <hi>quà Decima, as they are Tythes,</hi> consecrate to a <hi>holy</hi> end, and vse, they put on a spirituall nature. For euen as the bread in the Sacrament before it bee consecrate, and sanctified by the Word, it is common; but after the consecration, it becomes Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and spirituall bread (which is that change the ancient Fathers so vsually speake of, not that bastard substantiall change, which the Pontificians would falsly father vpon them) in which respect the Apostle calleth the <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>the water of the Rocke,</hi>

And what is the end and vse, of such consecrate things? Is it not for the maintenance of <hi>Christs Ministers?</hi> and are not they in their persons, in their profession, by calling spirituall? and of what nature then can their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance be, but Spirituall?

                  </gap>gion, is easily knowne by his name, what metall he is of: Hee that first steps in vpon the <hi>Angels motion,</hi> is the corrupt and diseased Simonist: This sicke and ill affected person taking a draught of this blacke <hi>Stygian</hi> water, the Oath of Simony passeth out at six <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> by sixe euasions by himselfe inuented, perfectly cured (as he conceiueth) of two most desperate diseases; <hi>Simonie,</hi> and <hi>Periurie,</hi> and all other Symptomes of the same. Now all these sixe Porches, tend to make a cleere passage for one word in the Oath Simoniacall, wherein consists the whole power of the Oath.</p>
               <p>First therefore, they plead <hi>Not-guiltie</hi> of <hi>Simonie,</hi> and so consequently, not of periury, because they buy onely the Temporalls. This, I touched before: But now I retort it vpon themselues. They buy the temporall Benefit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Simoniacall. For euen <hi>Simon</hi> had a respect that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7450:22"/>
way: <hi>Mercari vult, quod pluris reuendat,</hi> Hee would buy, to sell the dearer, saith <hi>Erasmus.</hi> So <hi>Augustine;</hi>

For to imitate <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in any such respect, is sufficient to proue the Act Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacall.</p>
               <p>Secondly not Simoniacall (say they) because they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine not with the Patron. Why? no more did <hi>Simon</hi>: for <hi>Peter</hi> was not the Patron of the Holy Ghost, but God;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> prayed, and God gaue. But this shift is all one, as if the Chap-man should deny hee bought such a Merchants wares, because hee dealt onely with his Factor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no lawfull bargaine. Thy Solicitor in thy name and stead procureth it of the Patron, thou payest thy money to thy Solicitor. And wilt thou sweare thy purchase had no relation to thy Patron? Though I could cut off all thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at one blow, with <hi>Phocion</hi> Axe, to wit, Directly, or Indirectly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, not Simoniacall (say they) because what they gaue, was but respectiuely to their Solicitors, for their paines imploied therein. But is not his paines valued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preferment, as it is more or lesse worth? as Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents fee their Lawyers, according to the value of their suit in hand? If so, is it not Simoniacal? But attendants must liue, either by their seruice, or by suits. So it hath beene the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> that Simonie should goe vnder the name of <hi>Subsidiary or El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And doth not such a gratuitie or almes, reflect vpon the Patron, as an implicite compact of Simonie, when the Patron respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasures his seruant, and thy Solicitor, with the Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7450:23"/>
of such a liuing, by meanes whereof he holds his seruant well appaid and recompensed for his seruice?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, not Simoniacall: for the preferment came not by purchase, but by <hi>wager,</hi> as it were casually, or by buying a <hi>horse,</hi> to pay for him so much at the day of marriage. But who seeth not this horse to interfer betweene Directly and Indirectly? who seeth not, that this Merchant laid, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to lose? But enough of such horse-play.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, not Simoniacall, sith he had the fauor to obtaine, vnder an implicite Faith, without explicite or expresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; to saue his Oath and honestie, <hi>Quippe qui non adeo sit plumbei tardique cerebri, vt foro vti nesciat,</hi> and as wee say, Doe reason. <hi>Verbum enim sapienti.</hi> O, for a <hi>Phocion,</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Alexanders Presents</hi> (though sent him, because he was an honest man) and saying, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: Let him suffer mee to be an honest man still. <hi>Pauper Fabricius quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam à Pyrrho regni partem sibi oblatam recusauit, ne fidem su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Romanam temeraret. Poore Fabricius refused the fourth part of Pyrrhus his Kingdome offered him, least hee should dishonour his Roman fidelitie.</hi> But this Roman fidelitie was, <hi>in diebus illis,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was heathen. And <hi>Damianus</hi> saith, <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaci sunt, non solum qui paciscuntur, sed etiam qui pecuniam non pactam postulant: more Gihezi. Simonists are they, not only that bargain, but also that require mony, not of compact: as Gihe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Eutrop.

               <p>Sixthly, not Simoniacall, because this was obtained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it fell, as it were in the nature of an Aduowson, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; which differeth from an Aduowson onely, as a word of mouth, from writing. And an Aduowson is no Simonie. For answere: first, promise and Aduowson in common estimate and practise, differ much; for promise is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7450:23"/>
excepted against in the Oath; otherwise, what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there be any Simonie, when as promise might preuent it? For Aduowsons, I referre to a more proper place, yet this I will say by way of anticipation, that if buying of an Aduowson (it passing vnder hand and seale) bee no Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: what reason is there, why a contract made onely by word of Mouth, should bee accounted Simoniacall? Thus haue wee hunted the Simonist out of his six Meshes: and if hee haue or find any more, we will set him for him Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Indirectly, which will be sure to catch this Foxe, and all his Cubs.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WEe haue seene what a Simonist is: Now let vs see who, &amp; of how many sorts they be. It was a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and impious decree of Pope <hi>Hildebrand, Gregory</hi> the seuenth, to draw all Kings and Princes, and Lay-persons into the ranke of Simonists, onely for presenting to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes and Benefices, although they did it most freely and honestly. But the maine drift of this grand founder of Antichristian vsurpation ouer Christian Princes, was both to inrich his Coffers, and to fortifie his Papall See, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieging the whole Prelacie, and Clergie to his Pontificall Chaire. But all Simonists are either buyers or sellers. The common fame indeed runnes onely vpon the buyers, as if they onely were the Simonists: but if the buyer be one, the seller must needs be another, by the Law of Relatiues. Of sellers, <hi>Esau</hi> is reckoned for the first, who sold his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and with it the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> For the birth-right had annexed vnto it Dominion; double portion, and the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. So that with his <hi>Birth-right</hi> selling the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> the most sacred Prerogatiue,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Some here may obiect, that reciprocally <hi>Iacob</hi> also in buying the <hi>Birthright,</hi> committed <hi>Simonie.</hi> But <hi>Lyra</hi> answereth well, Not so; for the <hi>Birthright</hi> belonging to <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> owne designement and donation (<hi>Gen.</hi> 25.23.) <hi>Esau</hi> therefore hauing lost his right to it, by selling it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Simonie:</hi> whereas <hi>Iacob,</hi> by buying that which by the best title was his owne alreadie, intended, <hi>Non emere rem Sacram, sed redimere vexationem suam, Onely to buy his owne peace.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> If <hi>Iacob</hi> in so buying committed no Simonie, because he bought but his owne: then why may not a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister buy, and yet commit no Simonie, sith Tithes doe as well appertaine to the Minister, as the Birthright did to <hi>Iacob,</hi> both, by Gods donation. But the case is not alike. For, although Tithes are by Gods owne intitling tied and intailed to his Ministrie: yet this or that Minister hath no title to this or that Tythe, till hee be lawfully possessed and inuested in them. And when hee is so, if hee meete with a craftie or cruell Patron, a prophane <hi>Esau,</hi> who either frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently vsurpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I thinke few will bee so forward so to redeeme, as to need the Bishops prohibition.

               <p>Now let vs see in a word, vpon what reason that which hath beene deliuered by the Canonists and Schoole-men, and learned Diuines concerning this point, is grounded:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7450:26"/>
                  <hi>The right of Patronage</hi> (say they) <hi>may not be sold.</hi> Why? Not onely in regard of the nature, and condition of such dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate things, which are spirituall; and therefore incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent matter of Sale: but also of the necessarie effects, and inconueniences which must needes follow vpon such Sale. For, grant a libertie that it be lawfull to sell a Patronage: then it followeth, that it will be as lawfull to sell a Presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and then an Aduowson: And then I would faine know, why it should not bee as lawfull to sell the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, when it is vacant? But because men make no great question about the lawfulnesse of selling, either in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancie, or much lesse before it; consider we the lawfulnesse or vnlawfulnesse of buying. To buy an Aduowson passeth currant for lawfull: and yet to buy the Vacancie, is iudged Simonie, both by our Statute Lawes, and Church Canons. Well, I thus infer, and so conclude: if it be Simoniacall to buy a Benefice, when it is vacant: why then should it not be equally Simoniacall to buy the Aduowson? and so of the Presentation? and so of the Patronage? Or if it bee lawfull to buy the Aduowson, why should it not bee as lawfull euerie whit to buy the Benefice? yea, of the two I should thinke it rather lawfull to buy in the Vacancie, then before. Because it may seeme an iniurious thing, as to take another mans <hi>Lease,</hi> so another mans <hi>Liuing</hi> ouer his head: And it is vnlawfull to contract for anothers mans wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her husband bee dead. But it is an infallible rule: <hi>Quod</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>est secundum se malum ex genere, nullo modo potest esse bonum &amp; licitum.</hi> It is <hi>Aquinas</hi> speech, which he applies to disproue the lawfulnesse of a lie for any respect. <hi>That which in its owne nature and kinde is euill, can by no meanes bee good and lawfull</hi>; or that which is substantially euill, cannot bee made good by any circumstance. To buy things of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nature, is naturally euill, as was said before: Any act is naturally euill, when it falleth vpon an vndue sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; if therefore it be euill to buy a Benefice in the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then it is euill to buy the same, either in the Aduowson, or in the Presentation, or in the Patronage. And if it bee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7450:27"/>
euill to buy: then by the Law of <hi>Correlation,</hi> it is euill to sell in all these respects. And if the buyer bee Simoniacall, the seller must be so too. Again, as it is vnlawfull so to buy and sell, in regard of the nature of such things, being spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: so also in regard of the common effects and fruits of such merchandize. For tell me: when yee buy an Aduow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or Patronage of an Ecclesiasticall Liuing; to what end is it? To bestow it freely and faithfully vpon some worthy able Minister, for the good of Gods Church, without any Temporall respect? It were to bee wished, this were your end. But doe you not intend to gaine by such a bargaine, either by placing some of your kin, or by selling it in the Vacancie to him that will be your best Chap-man? Is not this the generall practise? Nor doe I hereby condemne our Law, for allowing such things, as Aduowsons and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages to bee bought and sold: Seeing it also disalloweth Simoniacall, or by respects, which being taken away, either few or none would meddle with such merchandise, or else they should not so iustly incurre the Censure of Simonie, as so commonly they doe.</p>
               <p>Yet here I put a difference betweene the purchase of an Aduowson, and of the intire Patronage. And againe, I put a difference betweene the purchasing of a Patronage by a priuate man, and by a Colledge in the Vniuersitie. For the purchase of a single Aduowson doth too commonly aime at some temporall or carnall respect, or commoditie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as some may happily purchase the perpetuall Patronage, to leaue it as an honour to his House, or posteritie, while hee and his heires, according to his intention and will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the instruments of Gods glorie in the judicious and ingenuous bestowing the Benefice franke and free at euerie Vacancie. But this being verie rare, although I neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, nor enuie the right of Patronage to bee resident in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, so it bee rightly vsed: yet I confesse I could wish (for the auoiding of that generall corruption, and abuse in the collation of Benefices) that Colledges in each Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie were possessed of as many, Patronages in this Land, as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7450:27"/>
possibly they could procure, or purchase, redeeming them out of many hucksters hands, which would be an excellent meanes, to increase Learned Diuines, to represse Simonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Pedanticks, to refresh the Colledges by continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange of Students, to prouide for manie able men to be exercised in the Church, whose gifts, for want of such meanes, often lie buried in a Colledge life. Yet I denie not, but sometimes corruption may creepe in at the Colledge gates, but the strict Lawes of Colledges, well executed, may, as a carefull Porter, either whip, or keepe it out. This were (in my opinion) the likeliest way to preuent Simonie, and to prouide a good Ministrie. And some Colledges (I know) are carefull this way, both in <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> whose example I could wish all the rest would bee as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to follow. But so much of purchasing.</p>

And if this be Simonie, as the Ancients haue defined it to bee, it were to bee wished that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, at least were free from stipulation, and that the maine end of such permutations did ayme principally at the common good of the Church. Yea, I haue heard of a strange kind of Simonie in fashion beyond the Seas, which they call, <hi>Sacrum-aucupium,</hi> in English, <hi>Sermon-simoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now what should moue this Frier <hi>predicaent,</hi> thus to colour and gild ouer his Simonie with such a sacred gold, is hard to say, vnlesse some false Glosse vpon the Prouerbs hath made him beleeue, that such preaching to such ends, is to speake a word in season, which is, <hi>Like apples of gold in pictures of siluer,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith. But the Glosse is ill tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Glose. The Apostle forbids such merchandise of the Word for filthy lucre sake. [2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.]</p>

And so if that glosse bee true, that a Bishop must bee the huband of one wife, that is, of one Benefice (as the Romish Church expoundeth it, not for any zeale they beare to singularitie of Benefices, but for the hatred they haue against the vniuersalitie of Priests marriages) then also may it bee as true, that a man making such a match for a Benefice, should marrie two wiues at once.</p>
               <p>I haue also heard of another base kind of Simonie in practise: That the Patron admits not his Incumbent, but with a stong Obligation or Bond, to tye the Incumbent to quit the Benefice at three moneths warning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whensoeuer

               <p>AS euery sinne is in its owne nature vnreasonable, as being repugnant euen to the Dictate of naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: So <hi>Simonie,</hi> for this reason, may challenge a place and ranke among other sinnes.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Simonie</hi> is vnreasonable, because it is sacriledge, it robs God of his right. Will a man rob his gods,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> to vsurpe vpon Tithes, by buying and selling (for buying and selling Tithes is an vsurping vpon Tithes) is to robbe God. For to buy of the Patron, is to subscribe that the right of Tithes is interessed in him, and not in God, and so to ascribe the power and propertie of tithes to the Patron that sels them, not to God, who gaue them, still retayning the proprietie of them in himselfe. Whence wee may conclude, all those to bee either Simonists, or Fauourers of them, that denie Tithes to be due <hi>Iure Diuino.</hi> For why denie they this, but flattering themselues, that thus they may the more licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously buy and sell them, and so hold the poore Ministers nose to the grindstone; whereas although they had beene dedicate onely by Man, yet ought they not so to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Simonie</hi> is vnreasonable, because it debaseth and vilifieth that which is honorable, as is the gift of God. And Tithes are the gift of God; therefore honorably to be esteemed. <hi>Peter</hi> said to <hi>Simon, Thy money perish with thee, because thou thinkest the gift of God may bee obtayned with money.</hi> Hee vilified Gods gift, and therefore hee was set light by the Apostle. Wherefore, and what was <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzars</hi> punishment? Hee set <hi>light</hi> by the holy Vessels of Gods Temple, when prophanely hee presumed to drinke in them, He and his Concubines: and was he not well requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when while hee was drinking, hee saw that hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon the wall, <hi>Thou art weighed in the ballance and found
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7450:39"/>
too light? Dan.</hi> 5.27. He <hi>set light</hi> by Gods consecrate things, and God <hi>sets light</hi> by him, hee findes him <hi>too light.</hi> Let all spirituall merchants both Patrons and Parsons, bee strucke with terror of this example, as <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was with the hand-writing. And hee must needes bee culpable of this sinne, that setteth any terrene price vpon a spirituall thing.</p>
               <p>A third reason, why <hi>Simonie</hi> is vnreasonable, is because it makes the Simonist besides himselfe. For hee comes as a Minister to buy: but buying, hee professeth and prooueth himselfe to bee no Minister of God. For as God gaue the Tithes anciently to the Leuites, he gaue them freely, and a free gift ought not to bee bought: So hee hath giuen the same to his Ministers of the new Testament as freely; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Minister therefore shall offer to buy these Tithes, must either confesse that they are not the free gift of God, or that he himselfe hath no interest in them, as the Minister of God, and so no Minister of God. If therefore holy Tithes belong properly and of right to Ministers, why doe they buy them? And if they buy them, what right had they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is against reason to commit treason; but <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> is treason. For as <hi>Iudas</hi> conspiring with the Iewes by buying and selling, betraied the person of Christ: So Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monists conspiring together through buying and selling, betray the Church of Christ, yea betray the body of Christ, the members of Christ; as shall appeare more at large, when we come to shew the effects of Simonie.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Simonist</hi> obiecteth. I am faine to buy, because All, or Most are set a buying; So that if I buy not I am like to haue nothing. This is as good a reason, as if hee said, I must sinne, because it is the fashion of All, or Most, so to doe. This man will goe to the Deuill for companie. But let mee tell thee, if it were not for such as thou art, wee should shortly haue no Simonists at all. For thou buyest, because others buy; Well: Doe but thou, and all such as thou art, who thus sinne by others example, hold your hand a while, and in short time <hi>defluet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

rule, whither they goe forward, or backward in Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they doe not so much as heare one message; and for the poore of their flocke, they are altogether negligent and ignorant of them. Is this to be a Bishop? Is this to imitate the Disciples of Christ, and to obserue the Euangelicall precepts? Therefore a good Bishop shall labour, not to commit his flocke to anothers Cure, but to bee absent from the Fold as little space as may bee, vnlesse for some reason he be called away by the Pope for some speciall seruice, for the good of the Christian common-wealth. But let him not wish or desire this occasion to be giuen him, nor let him make suite for any such thing; but let him very hardly, and in a manner vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly vndertake this taske; which being dispatched, let him not procure another, but with all speede let him returne to his flocke: <hi>so he.

The Lord said to the twelue, Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a Deuill? Lord Iesus, seeing the election was in thine owne power, and thou hadst none to contradict, or controle thee, why didst thou chuse a Deuill? Why, good Iesus, didst thou not chuse a good, a iust, and a holy man, such as <hi>Peter</hi> was? Or if thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor doth the Lord God require a reward, but honor. For our God who hath vouchsafed to giue vs the whole, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vouchsafed to receiue of vs a Tenth, not for his owne profit, but without question for ours. But if it be a sinne to giue slowly, how much more grieuous a sinne is it not to giue at all, or not to giue all the Tithes of thy warfare, of thy trade, of thy craft. For when as thou mayest by paying thy Tithes obtaine both earthly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly rewards, why art thou defrauded of this double blessing through thy couetousnesse? For this is a most iust and common Law with God, that if thou bringest not thy Tenths, thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be brought to a Tenth; thou shalt giue to the impious Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7450:54"/>
that which thou wilt not giue to the Priest. God is alwayes readie to blesse, but hee is hindered by the malice of men. For Tithes are required of du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And looke how many poore soules in that Parish, where he dwelleth that payeth not his Tithes, shall perish for hunger, of so many murthers shall be stand guiltie, before the Tribunall of the eternall Iudge: because that which God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for the poore, he hath reserued to his owne vses. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who desireth either to purchase to himselfe a reward, or to procure the pardon of his sinnes, let him pay his Tithes: Also let him not be negligent to giue almes of the Nine parts to the poore.</hi> Thus this holy Father.</p>
               <p>Now for a Corollarie or Conclusion of this point touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Censures of sacrilegious Simonists, I will make a briefe relation of those obseruations which <hi>Rebuffus</hi> hath collected in his last question of his Tract of Tithes. I omit to set downe his Authors quoted by him, referring that to the Reader at his pleasure, or leasure. <hi>Hee that payeth not his Tithes, but either selleth them or detayneth any part of them, hee fighteth against God.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He shall be alwayes poore. In times past when foure kindes of Tithes were duely paid, men grew rich; Now when one is not well paid, men are brought to a Tenth, And the Lord doth not remoue their plagues.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>They are cursed of God with penurie, with pestilence, with sudden death, and with a perishing name.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>They shall want necessaries, that denie God their duties.</hi> Fiftly, <hi>They are the heires of eternall death.</hi> Sixtly, <hi>They shall bee subiect to bodily infirmities and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</hi> Seuenthly, <hi>They shall be associated with the Deuils, which (as some say) are the Tenth part of the Angels.</hi> Eightly, <hi>Hee that will not giue his due to God, shall giue that to the profane Souldier, which he will not giue to the Priest.</hi> Ninthly, <hi>Such is a Thiefe, and infamous person.</hi> Tenthly, <hi>Such shall be guiltie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods Tribunall, of murthering so many poore soules, as haue perished for want of not paying the Minister maintenance.</hi> Eleuenthly, <hi>Such are sacrilegious persons, &amp; consequently lyable to eternall damnation, and ought euery Lords day to be denounced by the Minister, excommunicate.</hi> Twelfthly, <hi>defrauders of Tithes

They are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and vngracious vngratefull persons, and shall bee eternally damned in hell. And as the Philistins were punished with Mico and Locusts, with Emrods and manifold miseries, so long as they detayned the Lords Arke: So shall the Defrauders of Tithes bee continually exercised with punishments, and wax old in miseries, vntill they make a full restitution. For such are well worthy to bee smitten with Diuine reuenge, to be punished with Gods own iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands, as either to be punished with wicked children, or to die a sudden death, or to bee slaine, or to haue their house and goods consumed with fire from heauen. Such is the reward of sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Simonie, or simoniacall Sacriledge. But he that shall vse no fraude or couen in his Tithes, shall be rewarded of God with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, which the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost vouchsafe to grant vnto vs. Amen.</hi> So hee. Whence wee may obserue how detestable the sinne of Sacriledge and Simonie is; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though otherwise, I doe not approue of euery particular passage cited by my Author, as some of them smelling of the Romish Caske. But let it suffice to make such sinnes the more odious to all louers of the Truth.</p>

                  <p>Of the miserable fruits and effects of Simonie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe effects and fruits of Simonie are no lesse miserable, then the Censures are grieuous, and the punishments thereof intollerable. For as <hi>Simon</hi> is the Father of all Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists: So <hi>Simonie</hi> is the Mother of all Mischiefes in the Church. For Simonie doth vsually poyson and corrupt two Well-heads, whence the streames of good life doe general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flow vnto all the people; that is, the Parson, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron. These be, as the two great Lights in the Firmament of the Church, from whom the sublunary and subordinate people receiue the direction and conduct of their life.</p>
               <p>Now for the Parson or Minister, hee is the Salt of the earth, the Light of the world, the Guide of the simple. But whom Simonie maketh vnsauoury, darkneth, blindeth: Wherefore as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>When the Candle is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, when the Pilot is drowned, when the</hi>

                  <hi>Captaine is captiued, what remaines for the remnant?</hi> Let no man despise thy youth, said the Apostle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> Why? Because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth more impeach and disaduantage a Ministers la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and frustrate all the fruit of his calling, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt iustly contracted vpon his person. And nothing makes him more contemptible, then <hi>Simonie.</hi> And what so captiuates their spirituall Captaines, what makes them so mute in Gods cause? what doth so euirate their mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line profession, that they dare not doe their dutie, when necessitie commands it? If not Simonie? For as Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> saith, <hi>A good Pastor, entring into the Fold,</hi>

to vertue, nor so readily obey his precepts, because his violent intrusion into the Sheepefold diminisheth much of his Reuerence and Dignitie, and causeth them lesse to loue him, and more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to set by him.</hi> So hee.

vpon it. One asked sometimes how it was, that in Athens, so goodly and great a Citie, there were no Physitians. To whom this answere was made, because there are no rewards appointed for them that practice physicke. The same answere may be made for our times; the cause why the Church of God is so forsaken, is the want of zeale to them, that should either for their courtesie, or for their habilitie, bee fosterers of learning, and increase the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, where occasion is, and giue hope and comfort to learned men. What said I? Increase? Nay the liuings and prouision, which heretofore were giuen to this vse, are taken away. Haue patience, if any such bee here (as I well know there are) whom these things touch. Suffer me to speake the truth, it is Gods cause. The liuings of such, as are in the Ministry, are not in their hands, to whom they are due. All other Laborers and Artificers haue their hyer increased double as much, as it was wont to bee: onely the poore man that laboureth and sweateth in the Vineyard of the Lord of hosts, hath his hire abridged and abated. I speake not of the Curates, but of the Parsonages and Vicarages, that is of the places, which are the Castles and Towers of fence for the Lords Temple. They seldome passe now adayes from the Patron, if hee bee no better then a Gentleman, but either for the Lease, or for present money. Such Merchants are broken into the Church of God, a great deale more intollerable, then were they, whom Christ whipped and chased out of the Temple. Thus they that should be carefull for Gods Church, that should be Patrons to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for the consciences of the people, and to place among them a learned Minister, who might bee able to preach the Word vnto them out of season, and in season, and to fulfill his Ministry, seeke their owne, and not that which is Iesus Christs. They serue not Iesus Christ, but their belly. And this is done not in one place, or in one Countrey, but throughout England. A Gentleman cannot keepe his house, vnlesse he haue a Parsonage or two in farme for his prouision.</hi>

Therefore they are wearie and discouraged, they change their studies, some become Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, some turne to Physicke, some to Law: all shun and flee the Ministerie. And besides the hinderance that thus groweth by wicked dealing of Patrons, by reason of the Impropriations, the Vicarages in many places, and in the properest Market townes, are so simple, that no man can liue vpon them, and therefore no man will take them.

I hope I speake tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which I speake without flatterie, that God hath indued your Grace with such measure of learning and knowledge, as no other Christian Prince. He hath giuen you peace, happinesse, the loue, and the hearts of your Subiects. Oh, turne and imploy these to the glorie of God: that God may confirme in your Grace the thing, which he hath begun. To this end hath God placed Kings and Princes in their state, as</hi> Dauid <hi>saith, that they serue the Lord, that they may see, and cause others to see to the furniture of the Church. The good Emperour</hi> Iustinian <hi>cared for this as much, as for his life.</hi> Constantine, Theodosius, <hi>and</hi> Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, <hi>and other godly Princes, called themselues Vassallos, the

                  <hi>by some Arguments which may perswade flesh and bloud. The world hath in all ages beene negligent therein, and therefore God in his Law, tooke such strict order for the maintenance of the Leuites: but especially now vnder the Gospell, this Calling is vnprouided for, when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues best of all to be rewarded; certainly (if Gods Law did not binde vs) it were a worthy Christian policy to propound good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments to this Calling, that thereby men of the worthiest gifts might be won vnto it, and the want thereof is the cause, why so many young men, of speciall parts, and greatest hope, turne to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vocations, and especially to the Lawes, wherein at this day the greatest part of the finest wits of our Kingdome are imployed; And why? But because they haue all the meanes to rise, wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For doubtlesse had not God himselfe in the Old Testament taken such strickt Orders for the liuings of the Leuites, they had beene put to no lesse extremities, then is the Ministerie of this age.

               <p>Now to all Patrons is my speech chiefly addressed. The Benefices in your Patronage, are but a gage committed to you of trust. And it is no small trust. The soules of Gods people are ingaged in it. Your first and chiefe care should be to make choice of a worthy Minister; next, to collate it on him freely, without either exacting, or expecting of him lesse or more.

How many such Merchants haue beene outed of all, if wee did but obserue the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?

When you bestow a Benefice at the earnest suit of any of yours, when you cannot bee ignorant of some base corruption, you giue your consent to the betraying of the lambes of Christ into the wolfes power. And where doth Simonie begin, but at this source? At this gate is let in some Alphabeticall homebred Pedant, the verie fry of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Such a one will bee content to change his Ferula, for a broken shortned Sheep-hook, and to accept, not what the Church may challenge, but what the Patron will leaue, and perhaps will cite authoritie out of the Grammer Schoole for it, if he haue so much Greeke, <gap reason="foreign">

In the meane while bee pleased to take into your consideration, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie there is (and consequently, what equitie) between your restraining Ministers from the lawfull purchase of your Farmes, and your vnlimitted purchasing of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Free-holds, the purchase whereof howsoeuer Humane Law makes it currant, yet Diuine Law hath proclaimed the contrarie. Besides, if Gods Law were silent, or of no force, yet herein humane and carnall reason might sway you. For consider, I pray you, &amp; consult but with flesh and bloud; in restraining Ministers from that libertie, what doe you, but bring an old house vpon your owne heads? For doe not Ministers come out of your loines? Doe you not make interchangeable &amp; reciprocal marriages with them? (except where any of the Lay-tribe (as too many there be) doe disdaine to match with a Priest, as they terme vs) Are not their children your grand-children, doe not their sons match with your daughters, and their daughters with your sonnes? We are not, as once the Leuites, a Tribe so select, and so separate from the rest of our brethren, but that in all naturall respects we communicate with you. We that are now Ministers, were once (if you remember) your sonnes. And your sonnes may be (if you consider) Ministers as we. To whom then doe you denie this libertie? Is it not to your owne sonnes and daughters, and grand children? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to your owne flesh and bloud? Say, a Minister, your sonne-in-law dieth poore, leauing a poore widow, and so many small helplesse orphanes behind him; is she not now your daughter still, and are not her babes your grand-children, flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone? Well; you that cannot bee content to giue Ministers libertie so much as to purchase a Farme, if they bee able in their life time (&amp; haply they were able; had money; but for want of such occasion to lay it out, spent it, now it is gone; and no signe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

yea and compassion in you, that you will not denie your daughter and grand-children, harbor and maintenance, in this their distressed calamitie. But now if you find a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in your bowels, vpon better reason to repeale this law, then haply whereon it was first grounded: yet for all that, you must not thinke to claime the like libertie in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing Gods owne patrimonie, which is holy. Your doing Gods Ministers right and reason, giues you no warrant or priuiledge to wrong God. Doe God right, and deny his Ministers, your owne bowells, no reason. But this by the way, to show that in no case sacred Tithes are to be bought and sold.</p>
               <p>No? In no case? Yes, in some case. There is a way of purchasing the sacred Tithes, which would be both accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, profitable to his Church, and comfortable to the soule and conscience of the purchaser himselfe. How is that? But alas! where shall wee find one Purchaser? Yet wee are not altogether hopelesse. There be verie many charitable and well disposed Christian men and women in this our Church, whom God hath inabled as well with a large hand, as a gracious heart, to leaue goodly Legacies to charitable vses, as Hospitalls, and the like: and no doubt more would bee, if they could find Executors or Feffees in trust, who could but liue to see the will of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queather duly executed. Now to all such well disposed Christians, that desire to <hi>make</hi> them <hi>friends of the vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mammon, and to lay vp in store for themselues a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the time to come, that they may inherit eternall life:</hi> to such let me addresse my speech. How many haue money to lay out vpon land, or so, and cannot light of a fit purchase?

But this commonly happeneth vnto such Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies, as extend no farther then to temporall ends, as to bodilie reliefe. Although I could wish men would see it done in their life time. But this, which concerneth mens soules, would bee done now while wee liue.

a certaine proportion (according to your graue iudgements) of all Impropriations within this Kingdome, to the better maintenance of a worthy Minister, especially where there are no Vicaridges at all indowed, or those that be, are very poore and incompetent to maintaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally the Lords labourers. So shall you bring a blessing vpon you and yours, yea vpon this whole Land and Church, extending euen to Posteritie, whose race shall (we trust) sing the memorable Acts of this euery way (as we pray) most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous and happy Parliament: and your humble Suppliant shall daily pray to God so to blesse this your happy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, as hereby Gods glory may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced, Religion propagated, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth established, Antichristian Heresie extirpated, and your selues blessed in your deed, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is in the naturall body: so in the politike. The fairest and best constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted body may haue some bad inbred Humours, or Impostumes, or Vlcers, which as they bee growne to greater height, require the bitterer Pills and Potions, the sharper Lancers, the hotter Cearers, and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Corr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now although the remedie bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied onely to the ill-affected part, or member: yet, such is the mutuall sympathie of all the parts, that they all ioyntly suffer, as one; all complaine alike of the bitternesse, sharpnesse, and smartnesse of the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, impatient of it, as if each part were the Patient. Which waighing with my selfe, I might iustly su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, least this <hi>Censure of Simonie</hi> (consisting of so many Ingredients, composed as it were into one plaister or pill, according to the iudgement and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of so many Doctors, proportionated to the qualitie and quantitie of the disease) being found to be so bitter and sharpe as it is, although it be applied onely vnto some ill affected members in this goodly

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rupt, and most noble parts, out of some tender sympathie, might complaine, as if without discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I applied it to the whole: but that I know, there is no one member of the body naturall, can better put a difference betweene its owne integritie, and its fellowes infirmitie, then those of the politick can. So that for me, as it were but the simple Apothecarie of so many Doctors, to goe about to protest, that this Censure is not generall, as applied to the whole: what were it else, but to argue, as if any impotency of sinister conceit (where there is no iust cause giuen) could take impression in such noble generous brests, the intire members of this beautifull body, or as if I could be guiltie of mine owne innocency. But herein must my protestation breake forth: nay, rather let it be turned into a ioyfull gratulation: How many are there, how many (I say) not a few, both of the truly generous Nobilitie, and of the truly noble Gentrie, euen all the truly vertuous of both, whose Patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are not tainted with the least touch of Simonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call corruption? Yea how many, and some of mine owne knowledge (whom I should not stick for their honour sake to name, but that the raritie of them in regard of mine owne knowledge, might seeme to breed enuie, and therefore I will reserue their names, till I can get a greater number, and shall haply haue occasion to touch vpon this argument againe) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I say, who in the vacancie of the Benefices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Presentation are not Patients, looking to be sought to, and sollicited (a thing which commonly
<pb facs="tcp:7450:74"/>
hath no good sauour) but themselues are Agents and Sollicitors, sending to the Vniuersities, and inquiring after the worthiest men for such a place and charge of Soules, on whom, thus carefully sought, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously found, they freely collate the Benefice, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the worthy Scholler (haply now pooring on his bookes in his priuate Cell, and dreaming on no such matter) the Presentation sealed vp in a Box: so farre are they from expecting, that any Schollers modestie should be made so much as to blush, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Suitor, much lesse his honestie be blamed, for presenting his suite sealed vp in a Bagge. Wherein, mee thinkes, I see a noble emulation betweene the Laitie, and the Clergie of <hi>England,</hi> and (let mee speake it in the Apostles sense) betweene the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and the fathers. You are the gracious Sonnes, the sacred persons Patrons, are your spirituall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who haue begot you by the Word of Truth. O blessed emulation, free from the least enuie, sauing that it may well bee the enuie of other Nations. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate still yee sacred Fathers of the Church, and you noble heauen-bred Sonnes of such Fathers, of such a Mother. Contend on Gods Name, who shall bee able to lift vp whitest and purest hands, freest from Simoniacall briberie, when you shall all stand together at the great Barre: that as you were carefull to call worthy persons to the Pastorall Cures within your Patronage, bidding them, <hi>Come,</hi> not abiding till they should come without a Calling: so it may bee said to you at that day, being of the number of Gods Elect, and called to the great assembly of the

               <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</hi> O blessed recompence! As you freely called the blessed Ministers of Christ, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to come to their Ecclesiasticall or Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call inheritance here in the Kingdome of Gods grace, prepared for them by Gods speciall appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vnder God by your speciall care, as Gods Feoffees in trust:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.21.</note> so then at that day, <hi>You that haue beene faithfull in a little, shall bee made Rulers ouer much,</hi> and <hi>enter into your Masters ioy.</hi> What shall I say more? Your vertues haue almost rapt mee with you into that third Heauen, where also I see other of your workes following you, and giuing full testimonie to what I haue said. And here I haue a new occasion to breake forth into a second Gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; where I must begin with you the worthy Knights and Gentlemen of the Lower House of Commons. For I heare that now of late you haue by one vnanimous Vote, for your parts, passed a Bill in your House, that Patrons also shall take the Oath of Simonie, in as large and ample manner as the Presentee doth. Here let mee also congratulate my owne happinesse, that my maine Petition and Desire is granted, before I could come to make it knowne vnto you. And blessed bee God, who hath put into your hearts this godly care. You haue begun it, and it is alreadie more then halfe done, nay, as good as altogether done. For you haue commended it to the Honorable Lords both Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb facs="tcp:7450:75"/>
and Temporall of the Vpper House. And is it not then as good as done? For comming to the Temporall Lords, their pure vn-simoned hands will easily subscribe: and doubt not then of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hands of the Lords Spirituall; whom, if the matter laboured of some difficultie, you should finde as the <hi>Triarij,</hi> to redintegrate all. And what is wanting then, but (which is neuer wanting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and to the Church of God) the Kings Royall assent, which shall crowne this noble Act. From the influence of whose Spirit (no doubt, next vnder God) as from a most carefull <hi>Nursing-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of Gods Church, this motion came first to bee inspired into you, as the will and affections receiue their prime direction from the Soueraigne Dictate of the intellectuall Power. And to make this good, mee thinkes, I see the very foot-steps of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Spirit and ingenie leading you along vpon the ground of reason, and equitie. For, with what reason and equitie, shall hee that purchaseth, both be punished in purse, and pinched in conscience, by taking the Oath; and he that selleth, shall inioy his Chapmans pecuniarie mulct, as a reward of his owne equall, if not superiour, sinne, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science called to no account for it. As if a Law were made to punish him that is robbed, and not the Thiefe; or to punish him that is oppressed by vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and not the Oppressor. If any Recusant, though hee professe to bee the Kings Liege Subiect, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to take the Oath of Allegeance, who will sweare for him, that hee is, and will bee a loyall Subiect?
<pb facs="tcp:7450:76"/>
so that Patron, that shall bee vnwilling, either that a Law shall bee made for him to take the Oath of Simonie, or being made, will be loth to take it, who will sweare for him, that he neither is, nor meanes to bee a Simonist?</p>
