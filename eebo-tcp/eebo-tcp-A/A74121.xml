         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">The Humble Petition, and deſires of many thouſand well-affected perſons, in, and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> in behalf of themſelves and the whole Kingdome.</head>
            <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioners being ſenſible what it is to offend the Almighty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his wrath upon our ſelves and our poſterity, (as alſo of the miſery of a late and laſting War) and how dangerous a thing it is to offend againſt the very light of Conſcience, and to dally with Oathes and Covenants, &amp;c. And having taken into our Conſideration the preſent ſtraits we are in, if under one hand we ſhall oppoſe or ſpeak againſt thoſe preſent viſible powers in being: Or on the other hand, ſhall violate the Oath of Allegeance, (which we were forced to take when we became Free-men, and Subjects to the King) the Proteſtation, and the late Solemne League and Covenant, all which we have, by many learned Divines, beene from time to time taught that they ought not to be violated, and that from the ſame we could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
            <p>But ſo it is, as we humbly conceive, if we ſhall comply with our Brethren in laying aſide of the King, the Parliament, the preſent Settled Lawes, and Conſtitutions of this Kingdome; and ſhall ſide with, and abbet in depoſing of the King, and His Poſterity, the diſmembring of Parliament, the defrauding of Fellow-members of their Freedome, for to Chuſe, or to be Choſen, in places of Office and Truſt in the Kingdome; we ſhall thereby violate our Oathes, give up our undoubted Rights to others, offend God, and ſinne againſt the light of our own Conſciences: Or if not, we ſhall expoſe our ſelves, and Eſtates, into the power of thoſe, who (by the known Lawes, and undoubted Rights, belonging and appertaining unto the Subjects of <hi>England</hi>) have no power over us, and to be tryed, and diſpoſed by unwritten, and uncertaine Dictates, Lawes and Rules, to which we never gave the leaſt conſent, nor had the leaſt knowledge of.</p>
            <p>Neither are we ignorant of what evill Conſequences to this Kingdome, the depoſing of former Kings hath been, witneſſe the Story of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and others: And how God from time to time, hath taken vengeance on Covenant-breakers, (though it was amongſt Heathens themſelves) who have made ſpecious pretences of good, untill they have gotten power into their owne hands, &amp;c. and of the ſad conſequences that have riſen from the change of Government in a State, witneſs that of <hi>Athens,</hi> &amp;c. All which, we beſeech you to take into your ſerious conſideration, (know you not yet that <hi>ENGLAND</hi> is deſtroyed) before our miſeries come inevitably upon us, and there be no remedy, nor hopes of Reſtauration to our hoped-for Peace and Tranquility; and that for the prevention of the fore-mentioned evills felt or feared,</p>
            <p>1. You will pleaſe to propound to the whole Kingdome, (and not a part only) that they, within a certaine time to be limited, convene together, to declare their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent Members, or to chuſe others inſtead of them: which Parliament ſo freely and ſatisfactorily choſen by the whole Kingdome, may (with the advice of our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi>) conſult, and adviſe for the ſpeedy Setling the Peace of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes upon ſure and laſting Baſes.</p>
            <p>2. That for matter of Religion and Church-Government, you will pleaſe to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of an Aſſembly of Miniſters, Convened out of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that ſo the better ſatisfaction may be given, as to your ſelves, ſo to the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>3. That you will declare unto us, what immunities you will pleaſe to grant, to thoſe that diſcent from, and cannot in Conſcience joyne with the now propounded Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Propoſitions drawn up and propounded by a few unto the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp;c. and that, though in ſome meane condition, we may live in peace amongſt our Brethren, who once declared it as moſt unreaſonable, for all Government to be in the hands of a Party, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore our humble deſire is, that your Honour; would be pleaſed to take the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes into your ſerious Conſideration: which granted,</hi>
