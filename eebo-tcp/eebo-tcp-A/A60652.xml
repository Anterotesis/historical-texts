         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some clear Truths particularly demonſtrated unto the King
and Council, and both Houſes of Parliament, with all
Judges, Juſtices, Merchants and Ship-Maſters, why the
Innocent and Peaceable People, called Quakers, ought not
to be Baniſhed out of their Native Land, or any other
way be expoſed to Sufferings.</head>
            <p>1. BEcauſe they are People that believe in the Name of the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, and are regenerated into the Nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
and their life anſwereth the ſame in all Godlineſs
and Honeſty.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe they worſhip the Living God <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> and
are of a tender Conſcience towards God and all men.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe their Principle and Practice was never proved erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
by ſound Doctrine, neither doth the late Act diſallow it in
the ground, for <hi>four</hi> may meet beſides the Family; and the number is
but a circumſtance, and not the matter: And it is not a Chriſtian
practice to Baniſh men for being in Error, that are really ſo, muchleſs
ſuch as cannot be proved erronious.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe Nature abhorreth ſuch unkindneſs, and is afflicted with
ſuch hard dealings; for Nature is outwardly friendly to her own ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe they have not at any time forfeited their Juſt Liberty
as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> by contriving any Plots or Inſurrections againſt the
preſent Government, as experience all along hath ſhewed.</p>
            <p>6. Becauſe they have a right in the Kings Word and Promiſes,
concerning Liberty unto tender Conſciences, for they have lived
peaceably, which was the only Exception to make his Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
void, and that they have kept and not broken.</p>
            <p>7. Becauſe they are an Harmleſs People, and give no juſt occaſion
of offence unto any, neither can any true proof be given againſt them
concerning any evil committed or done by them.</p>
            <p>8. Becauſe they are a Serviceable People in their places, ready to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58671:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do good upon all occaſions, and unto all perſons, and do not abuſe
the Creation in vanity and exceſs.</p>
            <p>9. Becauſe they are good Examples in Righteouſneſs, and a ſweet
Savour in their Generation, by following that which is good.</p>
            <p>10. Becauſe they do not tranſgreſs any Juſt Law, neither give
any Juſt occaſion for any Law to be made, or executed againſt them,
neither can any Law that is for the puniſhment of Evil-doers juſtly
take hold upon them.</p>
            <p>11. Becauſe they never acted nor intended any ſuch things, as
in the late Act is expreſſed, and againſt which it only provideth;
neither can any miſdemeanor be juſtly laid to their charge.</p>
            <p>12. Becauſe their outward dealings amongſt men are juſt, and
equal, and in all things free from variance and ſtrife.</p>
            <p>13. Becauſe they do not wrong any mans Perſon or Eſtate, and
are Free-born <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> which <hi>Magna Charta</hi> preſerveth in their
outward Liberty.</p>
            <p>14. Becauſe many Families will be left outwardly diſtreſſed, and
the Nation diſtracted and diſordered.</p>
            <p>15. And chiefly, Becauſe the Lord God of Heaven and Earth is
grieved and vexed with it, and the proſecution of it will kindle his
Wrath in a high degree.</p>
            <p>Now let theſe Truths be well conſidered, and the heat of Violence
ſtayed, for there is no juſt cauſe given by us why it ſhould be ſo done
unto us; and we are very clear in the ſight of God, that we have not
forfeited our Juſt Liberty in our Native Land, but have as good Right
to continue and abide therein as any People whatſoever, and there is
not any thing can be truly ſaid otherwiſe of us; but things are wreſted
that are proſecuted againſt us, and our Cauſe is preſented after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner than what it is in it ſelf: And divers things are charged
upon us from bare ſuppoſitions (and many of you know it) and
thereby we are expoſed to hard Sentences by men, when we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to God, with clear conſciences, in thoſe caſes wherein men
render us Offenders: For we are not a willful, ſtuborn People, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we any way ſeek the ſubverſion of the Government, or the
harm of any mans perſon upon the Earth; theſe are only ſuppoſitions
by our Judges and Accuſers; and no ſuppoſition is a good ground to
proceed againſt us in a matter of ſuch high concernment: for our
not ſubmitting to the Requirings of men in caſes of Conſcience, is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58671:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
onely in obedience to the Doctrine and Command or Chriſt Jeſus;
And our Teſtimony is in Meekneſs and Fear, and not in willfulneſs
and ſtubornneſs; and we are wronged when ſuch Reproaches are caſt
upon us, though ſuch as fit to be our Judges, have their liberty to
ſpeak, and to interrupt our anſwers: And what would you have from
us that you have not, to give you better aſſurance of our Allegiance to
the King? Can any thing more evidently demonſtrate it than our
peaceableneſs? A thouſand Oaths impoſed (if we could ſwear at all)
would not be ſo binding unto our Conſciences, as the Love of God
in which we live, and by which we are conſtrained to live peaceably;
for it bindeth our conſciences into peace, and maketh us ſubject unto
Chriſt as Supream, and unto the King in his Civil Government: for
what can more clearly manfeſt our Subjection to his Kingly Power,
than our willingneſs to render unto him our Tax and Tribute? and
having theſe things rendered by us, you may conclude, that it is
enough, and as much as you are reaſonably to expect from us, and it
doth ſufficiently clear us from all ſuppoſition concerning our ſeeking
to ſubvert the Government; and herein we manifeſt our ſubjection
to the King, in living <hi>peaceably,</hi> and giving him that which is his due:
But the Rule and Government of our Conſciences we cannot give
into his hand, nor into the hand of any man, for that is peculiar unto
Chriſt Jeſus, and he alone hath the preheminence in our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and no man ought to call his Power in queſtion, nor to puniſh
us for obeying his Doctrine and Commands; for by Faith in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Commands, we live, and we dare not make Shipwrack of
it, but in his Love are conſtrained to keep it, and his Reward is our
unſpeakable Joy. Very much of this nature, hath been publiſhed in
tenderneſs of heart for your good, and therefore I ſhall not at this
time be large, for I know, that Love, Patience, and Meekneſs muſt
prevail: And the Lord God hath abundantly furniſhed and adorned
his Children with the virtues of thoſe heavenly Graces, in which
they ſtand as ſo many <hi>Innocents,</hi> that think no ill; and their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and holy Converſation, may even overcome you, to be pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and merciful towards them, and alſo, to be in love with them;
which you would aſſuredly be, if you had a right knowledge of
them. Oh it is a Chriſtian, and a Manly-ſtate, to be in Love, for
therein was Man created: And though the Fall hath Separated, yet
by Chriſt Jeſus every true Believer is again reſtored, and therein are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58671:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we diſpoſed towards the whole Creation; And what ever may come
to paſs concerning us outwardly, yet in Love we ſhall remain inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in Love lye down in Peace, which no man hath power to
give us, nor to take away from us. And ſo it is deſired, that every
one of you concerned, may ſeriouſly conſider this ſhort <hi>Preſentation
of our Innocent Cauſe,</hi> and let the Juſt Witneſs of God in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
determine the matter, and then we ſhall not be deprived of
our Juſt Liberties and Birthrights, nor of the outward comfort of our
near Relations; then we ſhall not be forced from our tender Wives
and Children, and leave them mourning and weeping behind us; not
thereunto conſtrained for any evil done by us, but in the kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionated
nature of unfeigned Love, in which we are bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ought not by any man to be parted, or put aſunder; and it
lieth contrary to the nature of Love to part and ſeparate outward
Relations after ſuch a manner. And if you will but receive the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
of Gods Witneſs, that Principle which pleadeth in your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
on our behalf, it will determine the matter equally, and then
we ſhall not be found worthy to be deprived of our Right, Liberty,
and outward Comfort, but ſhall be found worthy to ſit in peace with
our Families, and follow our honeſt Callings, and ſo continue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in our Generation, within our Native Land. And that will
free your conſciences of much vexation and trouble which otherwiſe
will come upon you; for if you proceed to proſecute the matter unto
the end, the <hi>Cry of the Widows and Fatherleſs, will ſo</hi> eccho <hi>in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to be a continual Terror unto you; nay, thouſands will make a
doleful Lamentation on the behalf of their honeſt Neighbours and Friends.
[Oh let not ſuch a Lamentation be taken up in</hi> England, <hi>as to have a
poor deſtitute Wife, mourning and weeping for want of her Husband, and
poor young tender Children mourning and weeping for want of their Parents,
and one Neighbour and Friend mourning and weeping for want of another]</hi>
and you the cauſe of it; this will be a heavy burden upon you, and a
terror in your conſciences, if you do occaſion it: for there are many
tender hearts in <hi>England,</hi> though ſome be grown into hardneſs, and
in hardneſs ſit rejoycing, rather than pitying; but the Lord ſeeth and
knoweth the ſecrets of all hearts, and the hardeſt of hearts he will
break and fill with ſorrow. O do not cauſe theſe things to come to
paſs by any of your means, leſt you draw upon your ſelves a burden
too heavy to be born; but let Pitty and Mercy ſtop the violence of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58671:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fury and Cruelty, that inſtead of Mourning there may be Joy, and
inſtead of Heavineſs there may be Gladneſs, and that will give you
eaſe in your own conſciences, and peace in the latter end: Which is
deſired, that ye all may walk worthy to know fulfilled; for the Power
of the Lord God will break all that ſtands againſt it, and that is his
Living WORD.</p>

            <head>The LAW deſcribed in its Nature and End.</head>
            <p>THat which may be properly and truly called Law, is that which
ſtandeth in Mercy, Juſtice and Equity; and by its Power and
Force preſerveth People in ſafety, as to their Life, Liberty and Eſtate;
that where any Wrong or Injury is offered or done by one man unto
another, there Juſtice and Right may be done in Mercy and Equity,
for relief of the Grieved: For every thing that is inſtituted in its
proper place, hath alſo its proper Object unto which it pointeth, as
to the End for which it is inſtituted: and divers Caſes and Sentences
might be aſſerted out of the old Law, which anſwereth this very End,
which being Law in its ſelf, as being inſtituted for the preſervation
and well-being of all Free-born Engliſh-men, and its power yet ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and continuing in force, and alſo being counted the Foundation
upon which all enſuing Acts ought to ſtand, and ſo to be compleat and
perfect in one Body; if any thing be Enacted that cannot be ſettled
upon this Foundation, or united to this Body, which is counted the
<hi>Body of the Law,</hi> it cannot properly and truly be called Law, but
is rather holden for Error; ſo that the Foundation, or Body of the
Law, ſtandeth as a Rule unto all future and ſucceeding Ages, that they
may be directed in their Acts and Inſtitutions, wherein they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned:
For if it was not ſo, there could be no Error; but it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that there may be an Error, and ſo conſequently a Rule that is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from, when an Error is committed; and the Error muſt needs be
this, When any thing is enacted or executed that cannot be united to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58671:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Foundation, or Body of the Law: For if the Body of the Law
ſtand in Mercy, Juſtice and Equity, to the preſervation and ſafety
of Life, Liberty and Eſtate; and future Ages do enact againſt ſuch
as do not wrong any man in Life, Liberty, or Eſtate, ſuch an Act
cannot be united to the Foundation, or Body of the Law: And it
appeareth that the Body of the Law is ſo intirely compoſed in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Juſtice and Equity, that no future Age could yet find it defective,
but have allowed it to be good and right in its Inſtitution; ſo that it
ſtandeth and remaineth in its power and force, and is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the Rule to walk by, for the good Government of all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
And as it remaineth in force, ſo there is nothing to be enacted
and counted for Law, but that which will clearly unite to its Body,
in Mercy, Juſtice and Equity, whereby all People may have their
outward Rights and Priviledges preſerved unto them; and that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
agreeable to the Rational Part in Man, becauſe it anſwereth that
which would not be expoſed unto danger: for it is a thing generally
concluded, That Reaſon is the Mother of Law; foraſmuch as no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
Act or Deed ſhould be done by one man againſt another;
and ſo the Law is powerful to keep the unreaſonable part in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and when it is tranſgreſſed, to inflict equal Puniſhment upon
Offenders; and hereby it becomes <hi>a terrour to evil-doers, and a praiſe
to them that do well;</hi> becauſe it ſheweth Mercy, Juſtice and Equity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Wronged, by righting their Wrongs, and therein is the Terrour
unto the One, and the Praiſe unto the Other. Now if any Act be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
that doth not anſwer this End, then it is not reaſonable in the
ground, and conſequently no Law; for it is improper to call that Law
which is unreaſonable, being that Reaſon is generally accounted the
Mother of Law; and whatſoever Act doth erre from the Foundation
of Law, it doth not unite with the Body of the Law: And it is very
clear and plain, that if there be no Wrong-Doers, as the Object of
the Law, that then the Law in it ſelf is ſilent, as having nothing to
operate upon that offends it; and if there be no matter for the Law
to operate upon, then no puniſhment to be inflicted.</p>
            <p>Now as the Lord God of Heaven and Earth created all things in
good Order, and every individual ſtood in its place and ſervice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Offence in that day, but through the Fall is gone into Diſorder,
which remaineth unto this day; ſo the higheſt degree wherein men
are concerned in the Inſtitution of any Act, is but to reduce into that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58671:5"/>
comely outward Order again, that ſo no man may be grieved of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the wrong that another may do unto him, but that he may walk
ſafely in his Perſon, Liberty and Eſtate; and this is the furtheſt End
which the Law ſerveth unto, and that which is enacted in ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
uniteth with the Body of the Law, and is in it ſelf properly Law,
becauſe it operateth upon a proper Object, and reacheth with Power
and Force to ſuppreſs it; and by this Rule he that doth wrong ſuffers
for it, and he that is wrongnd comes to be righted; and ſo good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is kept amongſt men, by the Power and Force of the Law; and
that is a reaſonable thing, unto which the Law only ſerveth; and ſo
the Law is merciful, juſt and equitable in every point, foraſmuch as
the Inſtitution of it tendeth to the preſervation and well-being of
Men; for that which is ordained and inſtituted for the preſervation
of Man, is merciful towards him, it ſtandeth as an outward Defence
to his Life, Liberty and Eſtate: For the Law would not that any man
ſhould ſuffer wrong, and therefore it ſheweth Mercy to the grieved,
by doing Juſtice and Right, and that is properly the nature of Law;
foraſmuch as it is unreaſonable in ſuch as do the wrong, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to right ſuch as are wronged: And Reaſon being the Mother
of Law, it ſtrengtheneth the Law to operate upon all unreaſonable
things, as the proper object which it is to take notice of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the end of the Law is anſwered in Mercy, Juſtice and Equity,
which is agreeable to its nature. And the caſe may be put thus for
more clearneſs; What would there be to puniſh according to Law, if
all men lived peaceably, ſoberly, and righteouſly? if nothing (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there would not) then is there any other end in the Law, but
only to puniſh ſuch as live vainly, frowardly, and unrighteouſly? If
a man be a Freeborn <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and pay his Taxes and Tribute as a
Subject, and neither Plot, Contrive, nor Conſpire againſt the perſon
of the King, or ſubverſion of the Government, What Law is there
againſt him in that caſe? the Mother of the Law, ſaith, <hi>None at all,
foraſmuch as he hath done no wrong to the King any way, but is a peaceable
Subject.</hi> Again, If a man do not offer any violence to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or any way do him wrong, What Law is there againſt him in
that caſe? he is not an object which the Law takes notice of for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
foraſmuch as he hath not wronged his Neighbour, but is a
Sober man. Again, If a man be wholly diſpoſed in Righteouſneſs,
What Law is there againſt him in that caſe? Righteouſneſs is not an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58671:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
offence againſt the Law, for the Law is not deſtructive to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous;
and ſo in all other things, which are peaceable, ſober and
righteous, the power of the Law doth not operate upon ſuch for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
neither will any rational man affirm it, therefore the object
of the Law, muſt needs be the <hi>wrong doers;</hi> and the power and force
of it doth only extend to ſuppreſs them, becauſe they are injurious
to the well-being of peaceable, ſober, and righteous People; and the
Law in Mercy, Juſtice and Equity protecteth them from injuries,
and doth them Right when they are wronged, and this is properly
Law, and the end of its inſtitution. Now theſe things being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which indeed are ſo really true, as not to be diſputed or denied,
then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that when any Act is inſtituted, that
maketh peaceable, ſober, and righteous People the object of its power
and force, <hi>That</hi> cannot properly be called Law, foraſmuch as it
doth not unite with the Foundation and Body of the Law; for it is
not a reaſonable thing, that peaceable, ſober and righteous People
ſhould be diſinherited, or exiled, or any other way deſtroyed or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
there is neither Mercy, Juſtice, or Equity in it, which are
the only qualifications that the Law is ſetled upon: Therefore it is
fully concluded, that the peaceable, ſober, and righteous People, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Quakers,</hi> are under the protection of the Law in every point,
foraſmuch as they neither wrong nor injure any man, which draws
the Mercy, Juſtice and Equity of the Law over them; and ſo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Act is, or may be made againſt that People, or however it lieth
as to titles and terms for preventing and ſuppreſſing their Godly
Meetings, or any other matter or thing which pertains to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
yet it cannot make them Tranſgreſſors of the Law, though
they continue their Meetings or other Godly Exerciſes, contrary
unto ſuch an Act; becauſe their Meetings and Godly Exerciſes
are in tenderneſs of Conſcience towards God, and not to wrong
or injure any man; neither can any Experiences demonſtrate that
the practice of thoſe People have at any time, or in any place,
been any way hurtful to the Life, Liberty or Eſtate of any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
Therefore the Mercy, Juſtice and Equity of the Law is on
their ſide, and ſtandeth in it ſelf for their protection, and not for
their deſtruction; and whatſoever is enacted againſt them cannot
unite with the body of the Law, becauſe it doth evidently appear that
they anſwer the Law, when they meet together, as meeting peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58671:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſoberly and righteouſly, which wholly tendeth to the well-being
of all People; and therefore by the Law they are to be defended
from injury and wrong, and <hi>not to be diſinherited, exiled, deſtroyed, or
any other way puniſhed, by any Act whatſoever; for as they give no juſt
occaſion for any Act to be made againſt them, ſo none in Power is to make
any Act to puniſh them, but to extend the Mercy, Juſtice and Equity of
the Law towards them, who in all things anſwer the Law in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and peaceable life, wherein they walk in all Godlineſs and honeſty, as
becometh Chriſtianity.</hi> Thus in obedience to the Lord God of Heaven
and Earth, I have given forth my Teſtimony concerning theſe weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
matters, that none may endeavour to promote any thing againſt
thoſe dearly and welbeloved People of the Moſt High God, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully,
and ſcornefully, are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but in the Power
of God are truly <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with whom I am united in the <hi>Bond of
Peace,</hi> and therein reſt, a true Lover of all mankind.</p>

            <p>I Have much tenderneſs in my heart towards you, foraſmuch as I
believe, that many of you are of a grave and ſollid diſpoſition,
and deſire to perform your places of Truſt in honeſty and ſobriety as
becometh men; and you it is, that I deſire may well conſider the
whole matter, and chiefly theſe particulars following. (1.) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Priſoner ſtands upon his Tryal according to Law, that is,
whether it be properly and truly Law, that he is tryed by. (2.) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Law and the Witneſs agree together in every point, as to the
matter in queſtion. (3.) Whether the thing done, be really an
offence againſt the Law, and ſo a Fact puniſhable by the Law; for
there may be ſome Acts that will not unite with the Body of the Law,
as before is mentioned; and alſo there may be ſeveral interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Law, and the Judges may wreſt the Law by ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations;
as for inſtance, there is <hi>an Act to prevent and ſuppreſs
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58671:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Seditious Conventicles:</hi> Now according to theſe expreſs words, this
Act will unite with the Body of the Law, and in that ſence may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called, Law, becauſe it is to prevent and ſuppreſs ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and practices as tend to diſcord, ſtrife, and ill things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
tendeth to the preſervation of peaceable People. Now mark, If
any be tryed by this Act, becauſe they onely <hi>meet together to Worſhip
God in his Fear,</hi> and the Evidence can prove nothing farther, than
onely a <hi>Meeting,</hi> and the Judge tell you, <hi>that ſuch proof is ſufficient
to make ſuch guilty of an Offence, that are taken at a Meeting, though it
be not apparently Seditious;</hi> ſuch an interpretation makes the Law
to be no Law, becauſe it will not unite with the Body of the Law,
according to the ſence of the Judges interpretation; for the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
quite altereth the matter, and ſo maketh ſuch to be the objects
of their Interpretation, that are not proper objects of the Law; and
whoſoever are found guilty, as Offenders, from any ſuch interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
they are wronged and injured according to the Law: for
where the Inſtitutors of Laws do ſignify their minds in expreſs words,
if their minds and words will unite with the Body of the Law, then
no Interpretation is to wreſt their minds and words from their
proper ſence and ſignification, for ſo the Judges may interpret the
Law to anſwer the Witneſs, and thereby make an Innocent man
to appear guilty of an offence, when the Witneſs is to anſwer the
Law, by proving the Fact to be an offence againſt the Law it ſelf, or
otherwiſe the Law in it ſelf, doth not operate upon any man to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>Weigh and ballance theſe things in the juſt Principle of God, in which is
the pure Wiſdom that gives to diſcern the Precious from the Vile, and ſo put
a difference between thoſe that ſerve God, and thoſe that ſerve him not;
and let each condition be anſwered with a juſt meaſure, and therein you
will find your peace and happineſs both preſent and to come: And the Lord
give you Wiſdome and Underſtanding, that with boldneſs and courage you
may ſtand in Mercy, Juſtice and Equity over all the fear of men.</p>
