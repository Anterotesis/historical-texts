         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe following Letters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely for ſome particular
Chriſtians: but ſeeing that which
is contained in them is of general
concernment, I do here preſent it
to the view of all; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe the power of God doth appear in it
in reſpect of the weakneſſe and contemptibleneſſe
of the inſtrument whom he doth here employ; as
formerly it hath been his courſe in doing great
things by weakeſt means, and ſo by ſuch fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
he doth bring to nought the wiſdom of the
wiſe, that ſo no fleſh may glory in his preſence.
And as it hath been the manner of God's proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
heretofore, ſo likewiſe I finde the immediate
acting of the Spirit in giving in, and ſo accordingly
in carrying me forth to communicate it to others.
And ſeeing it is thus, I dare not conceal it in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,
but I muſt hold it forth to the view of the
whole world, not fearing any thing in way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
from the creature: for I fear not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
having ſuch enlargements in God: I fear not
reproach; for I can wear it as my Crown: I fear
<pb facs="tcp:98336:3"/>
not want, in that I do enjoy all in God: And though
I may be counted mad to the world, I ſhall ſpeak
the words of ſoberneſſe: and if I am mad, as the
Apoſtle ſaith, it is to God; and if I am in my
right mind, it is for the benefit of others. And I
deſire likewiſe that the Chriſtian Reader ſhould
know, though I queſtion not the truth of that
which I do here hold forth, yet I am reſolved not
to contend for it with carnal weapons, as by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
but rather I ſhall witneſſe the truth of it
with my Blood, if God ſhall call me to it: for I
have nothing to do, but to hold it forth, and ſo I
muſt leave it to God, who I know will witneſſe to
his own Truth, and reveal it unto all his in his good
time: in the mean while, ſo far as we have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
let us walk by the ſame rule, and minde the
ſame thing, and accordingly wait for further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</p>
            <p>And ſo I ſhall leave thee (good Reader) to the
manifeſtation of Chriſt in thy fleſh, which doth
begin to appear in ſome, and we do likewiſe expect
it in general unto all the Saints, when God ſhall
bring them out of darkneſſe into his marvellous
light; which is begun, and ſhall increaſe until it
be perfect day. And with this I ſhall cloſe up,
committing thee to God, and to the power of his
grace, ever remaining</p>

<hi>Babylon,</hi> as it is that vail of Darkneſſe which covers all fleſh,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 7. which God will ſhortly take away from all his

that Beaſt that did riſe out of the ſea did riſe firſt, and ſo did
act according to his power in the firſt place, yet ſure Babylon
falls firſt in this glorious State and Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
may well be underſtood to be the feet and toes of the great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
ſpoken of <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34. which are different from the legs,
which are altogether of Iron, which did ſhew the great
ſtrength of the Roman Monarchy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But here it may be objected, That</hi> this glorious Church
and State of England hath appeared to be a golden cup in the
Lords hand, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 7. in reſpect of the Spiritual excellencies
which have been ſeen in her; and therefore how can it be compared
to the feet and toes of the great Image, which is the meaneſt part of
the body?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, Though the feet and toes are the meaneſt
part of the body, yet it will appear that there are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
in them then the head of gold: for though the feet
and toes be thus mixt, part of Potters clay, and part of Iron,
which ſhews that the Kingdom is partly weak and partly
ſtrong; but though this part be not ſtrong by reaſon of the
mixture, yet I ſay there is more excellency in this mixture,
then in the head of Gold: for it is ſaid of this State, that they
did mix themſelves with the ſeed of men, which is a great
myſtery: And ſo though Babylon may be in all manner of
Profeſſions, and all States who govern in an arbitrary way,
yet I may boldly ſay, that Babylon, concerning whoſe deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the Prophets of old and <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeak,
that ſpiritual Babylon as it is a State and Church, and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
Babylon in our gathered Churches, and Antichriſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in a myſtery in the Saints; all which, out of queſtion,
is to be accompliſhed in this Iſland of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98336:6"/>
by the learned is made evidently to appear to be the tenth part
of the <hi>great City, which is ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt,
where alſo our Lord was crucified,</hi> Revel. 11. 13. that falls firſt.
Now if this can be proved, as very probably it can, that this
State and National Church of <hi>England</hi> be Babylon, then I
pray take notice of that which the Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 51. 49.
that <hi>as Babylon cauſed the ſlain of Iſrael to fall, ſo at Babylon
ſhall fall the ſlain of all the earth.</hi> Not that all the earth ſhall
be ſlain with a temporal ſword, but the earth is ſlain in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
ſenſe: for natural Babylon did not ſlay Iſrael in the fleſh;
for the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and other of the Saints had good
uſage in Babylon: And a ſlaughter to be ſlain in this ſenſe as
here it is ſpoken, it is to be ſlain by following their wicked
ways, in being led in Errour, and ſo ſlain by their ſin. And
ſure natural Babylon did never uſe ſuch cruelty on the Saints
as the Scripture ſpeaks of; onely on ſome which were not
Saints, but the enemies of God, which did go contrary to his
command in rebelling againſt the King of Babylon, unto
whom the Lord had given commandment by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the
Prophet, that they ſhould ſubject themſelves unto his yoke.
And ſo whereas it is ſaid that Babylon did cauſe the ſlain of
Iſrael to fall, it's Babylon in the Saints, that is, Confuſion and
Errour have ſlain the Saints in a ſpiritual ſenſe: as the Lord
ſays concerning his people, that they were ſlain by their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
as in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. it is ſaid, that <hi>the iniquity of Ephraim
is bound up, and his ſin is hid:</hi> but when it did appear, ſee what
follows, even the ſorrows of a travelling woman, and death
it ſelf. Now this is Babylons cauſing the ſlain of Iſrael to
fall. So Babylon cauſeth the ſlain of Iſrael to fall by her
falſe teachings, as in <hi>Iſai. 9. 13. Jerem.</hi> 51<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. and ſo forward;
again, <hi>verſ. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of the ſame Chapter; which ſhews how Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
did deſtroy the people of God by their falſe teachings.
Again, Babylon cauſeth the ſlain of Iſrael to fall, by her cruel
hatred, and moſt deceitful uſage, and by her vile reproaches,
by which ſhe ſlays the people of God with the ſword of the
heart, and with the ſword of the tongue, concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of which, is fully made forth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. So, as Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98336:6"/>
hath cauſed the ſlain of Iſrael to fall, ſo at Babylon ſhall
fall the ſlain of all the earth, which is fleſh in the Saints, when
the Lord hath judged with fire and the ſword all fleſh, as in
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. 5. and 66. 16. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 10. Now though ſinful fleſh
be ſlain in the Saints whilſt they are in Babylon, yet this is
not done till we are ſlain by Babylon, and ſo have attained
unto a reſurrection with Chriſt, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, 21. I
pray take notice of this Scripture; for it makes forth clearly
that ſtate of the Church which hath been or ſhall be ſlain by
Babylon, and riſen with Chriſt, being ſecured in that chamber
here ſpoken of in reſpect of the ſpiritual man, in that there
is no more ſin, nor hell, nor death; though hell and death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in the fleſh as yet, inſomuch that we have cauſe to cry
out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O wretched men that we are, who ſhall
deliver us from this body of death?</hi> But now the Lord is come
into his temple in many of the Saints, though we have a being
as yet in Babylon, amongſt the dens of lions, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the leopards: but though the Lord is come into his
temple, even the Meſſenger of the Covenant, in whom we
delight; yet it is ſaid, (<hi>Mal. 3. 1, 2, 3.) who can abide his
coming, and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth? what fleſh can
endure his preſence?</hi> Fleſh muſt die, when God appeareth in
it. So God ſits in his temple to deſtroy ſinful fleſh in his
Saints, which is done even here, whilſt we have our being in
this ſtrange land, amongſt our cruel enemies: But when the
Lord hath accompliſhed his work on <hi>mount Sion,</hi> which he
will effect by the cruelty of the inhabitants of Caldea, to the
mortifying of the fleſh in the Saints, then the Lord will viſit
the proud heart of the King of Babel, and gather all his from
among the Heathen, and ſo give reſt unto his people, and
diſquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſum up in brief the particulars of the fall of
Babylon, which is begun in ſome, and ſhall be accompliſhed
in all, even in this Iſland of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the firſt place,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Babylon is fallen in a very inconſiderable part of the Saints,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98336:7"/>
even in the leaſt number; but in a ſpritual ſenſe it is fallen in
the leaſt number: ſo when Babylon was thus fallen in them,
Light did appear, in that they had brought forth a man-childe
ſpoken of <hi>Rev. 12. 1, 2. Iſai.</hi> 9. and 66. which man-childe is
underſtood in the firſt place to be onely the glorious manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
of God in the fleſh of that number of Saints in whom
he doth appear. Now when God doth thus appear in any,
then that dragon which of late hath made <hi>war in heaven</hi> Rev.
12. who did not prevail becauſe <hi>Michael</hi> did withſtand him;
I ſay, when that dragon was caſt to the earth, even that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
State which is now come to confuſion, and ſo he ſaw his
power, he did preſently begin to perſecute that part of the
Church who did repreſent the woman which had brought
forth a man childe; but the woman had fled into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
where ſhe is kept, as is ſpoken of in the Scripture:
which wilderneſſe, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, is onely that place of
ſafety in which the ſpiritual man doth reſide, which is God
himſelf, who does manifeſt his preſence moſt unto his Saints
in their deſolate and diſconſolate condition; and the Saints
live more in God in the want of all help and comfort from
the creature, then in the enjoyment of all. But though that
part of the Church is ſecured in that place, which is God, in
reſpect of the ſpiritual man: yet as ſhe is in the fleſh, ſhe is
in Babylon, amongſt her hateful enemies, who have procured
the greateſt evil unto themſelves in perſecuting of the Saints.
In that the violences done unto us, unto our fleſh, be on Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
ſhall the inhabitants of Sion ſay, not onely in that which
God hath done already in the fall of this glorious State and
Church, which ſhall never be rebuilt again; but our blood be
on the inhabitants of Caldea, ſhall Jeruſalem ſay. Now
here we may ſee the fall of Babylon, whoſe fall is firſt in an
inconſiderable part of the Saints; and when it is in any, light
doth appear, and you know the Prince of darkneſſe hates the
light, ſo as they hate the light: they perſecute them in whom
God doth appear, and in perſecuting them, they daſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
againſt the rocks, and ſo are broken: and ſure the ſtone
that is cut out of the mountain without hands, ſhall fall on all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98336:7"/>
the enemies of God, and grinde them to powder, even as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
is fallen in ſome of the Saints, and fallen in the State
and National Church of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which out of doubt
is the great part of the tenth City ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. ſo Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
ſhall fall in all gathered Churches, and in all the Saints
ſhortly; and ſo not onely ſhall the ſtone break the feet of the
great Image, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when the feet are broken, then all falls with
it, the gold and ſilver, which is the truth it ſelf that is held
forth in Babylon; <hi>Howſoever truth ſhall return from the land
of the enemy,</hi> as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. and <hi>the fire ſhall try every man his
work:</hi> and we know that gold and ſilver ſhall abide the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and refining, and ſo truth ſhall be tried, and appear to be
truth; the Saints themſelves ſhall be tried, and appear to be
Saints: ſo in this fall and refining the Truth loſeth nothing
but its droſſe, and the Saints nothing but their corruption;
and when this is done, the whole body ſhall go out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

ſinging, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20, 21. When we ſhall truſt God in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe-condition
in reſpect of temporals, having ſo good
experience of his ſupplying us in ſpirituals; ſo aſſuredly, as
God hath already, and will gather all his out of Babylon ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
in reſpect of Errour; ſo likewiſe he will gather all
his from all places whither they have been led captive, as well
as out of this Land, which doth more evidently appear to be
ſpiritual Babylon then any other place: which gathering ſhall
be, out of doubt, a local ſeparation. The Scriptures to prove,
are as followeth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> the 8, 9, 13, 14, 25, 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27, 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35, 43, 52,
and 66 Chapters; <hi>Jerem.</hi> the 30, 31, 50, and 51 Chapters;
<hi>Ezek.</hi> the 37 and 39 Chapters; <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 5, 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 13 Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters;

                  </gap>h</hi> the 13. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. Compare theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
which ſhew the great tribulation which ſhall befal the
Church of God immediately before her deliverance out of
Babylon, in reſpect of Darkneſſe and Errour, and her deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
likewiſe temporally from the bondage of the creature,
the hateful enemies of God; and ſo the Church ſhall be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in that chamber ſpoken of in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26, and the wilderneſſe,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 12. as well in a temporal ſenſe as in a ſpiritual, which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98336:8"/>
is a place of ſafety, as we may underſtand it in the letter, which
God will provide as a reſting-place for the Saints; which I ſay
is an undoubted truth, in reſpect of the judgements of God
which are coming on the earth, an utter deſtruction of the
wicked by Sword, Peſtilence and Famine; which is one of
the main motives which God doth uſe, to perſwade his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to depart out of Babylon, <hi>Jerem.</hi> the 50 and the 51 Chap.
<hi>Rev.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto this it may be objected,</hi> If this were a truth that
you ſpeak concerning the gathering away of the Saints, ſurely
God would not hide it from his choſen ones: and certainly God
would not ſuffer them to act as they do, as to endeavour to build
up the State that is fallen; and ſhall the Saints build Babel? ſure
this is a very prepoſterous thing, and certainly this is not a truth
hold.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, <hi>That the Saints ſhall endeavour with all their
might to heal Babel, according to the appointment of God, as
in</hi> Jerem. 51. 8 9. <hi>where it is ſaid,</hi> Babylon is ſuddenly fallen;
howl for Babylon, take balm for her pain, if ſo be ſhe may be
healed. <hi>And when the Saints have endavoured what they can
to heal her, then they take up this ſad expreſſion,</hi> We would
have healed Babel, but ſhe is not healed; let us leave her, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
every one to his own Country: for her judgement reacheth
unto heaven, and is lifted up to the skies.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall give an Anſwer to ſome Queſtions, and ſome
Objections, and ſo cloſe up.</p>
            <div n="1" type="question">
               <head>The firſt Queſtion:</head>
               <p>How it can be ſaid that when the Saints depart out of the land
of their nativity, they go unto their own Country, if it be to be
underſtood of a local ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer, The Land of our nativity is not
their own Country to the Saints, if in ſuch a place they are
in bondage: for how was the land of Egypt the own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to the children of Iſrael, though it was the land of their
nativity, and ſo was Babylon to many of the people of God;
but the land of Canaan was the place of their reſt: and ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98336:8"/>
God hath prepared a wilderneſſe for the Saints to depart into,
when he ſhall gather them from the land of their Captivity:
not a wilderneſſe where there is want of all things, but where
there ſhall be abundance both of ſpiritual and temporal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
as can be proved by the Scriptures before quoted;
which is an undoubted truth, as well in a literal ſenſe as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
I ſay, it may appear to be a wilderneſſe for the preſent
to the carnal ſenſe, but it ſhall not be ſo long; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
doth prefix a time, <hi>Rev. 12. a time, and half a time;</hi> that
is, three yeers and a half: and then, when that time is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,
as in <hi>Iſai. 31. the ſolitary places and the wilderneſſe ſhall
rejoyce for them, and the deſarts ſhall bloſſome like a roſe.</hi>

            <div n="2" type="question">
               <head>The ſecond Queſtion:</head>
               <p>What is the reaſon, if God will gather his people out of their
land, he doth ſo hide it from the generality of the Saints: for there
is not one amongſt a thouſand of your judgement?</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer, that the Lord doth thus hide it from
his Saints, for divers Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe he will have them endeavour <hi>vi &amp; armis,
id eſt,</hi> by force and might, to heal Babel: which if it were
made known unto them that all their labour were in vain,
they would not trouble themſelves any further: but God
will have it ſo, becauſe he will render his Saints a righteous
people unto the whole world, and that they ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſhortly, when as they ſhall ſay in the words following,
<hi>The Lord hath brought forth our righteouſneſſe; let us declare in
Sion the works of the Lord our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon why it is thus hidden, Becauſe if it
were revealed, the people of God would be ſo impatient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
theſe ſufferings, that they would make too much haſte,
and be gone before that God have finiſhed his work on <hi>mount
Sion,</hi> which he hath appointed for Babylon to do, in the cruel
uſing of the Saints, unto the mortifying of the fleſh in them.
And the onely and true reaſon that God doth reveal it to ſo
few, is, becauſe there is no conſiderable part of the Church in
a capacity to apprehend ſuch a mercy as to have a deliverance
out of ſuch bondage as we are in to whom the Lord is pleaſed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98336:9"/>
to reveal theſe things, unto our great conſolation, in the time
of our greateſt dolour and extremity.</p>

            <div type="objections">
               <head>Now I ſhall anſwer to ſome Objections.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt of all it may be objected,</hi> How can it be made appear
that there is more excellency in the feet and toes of the great Image
then in the head of gold?</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer, that there is, in divers particulars, as
it is held forth in the letter.</p>
               <p>As firſt, There is more excellency in the feet and toes then
in the head of gold, becauſe the feet and toes, which were
partly of potters clay, and partly of iron, have mixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the ſeed of men, and ſo upon this account the ſeed
of men is more precious then the golden wedge of Ophir:
for none will deny but that the body of the meaneſt man in
the world is more worth then raiment, and ſo of gold, and
whatſoever we look on as excellent. Now this is clear in the
letter. In a ſpiritual ſenſe the feet and toes of the great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
is more excellent, becauſe they have mixed themſelves
with the ſeed of men. Now the ſeed of men in this nature, is
the Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unto this it may be objected,</hi> How can that be? for the
Saints are but men as others, as it is ſpoken of Elias, and Moſes,
and all the faithful, and ſo they have their infirmities, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer, It is true that the Saints are men, and
ſubject to infirmities, none will deny; but the Kings daughter
is all glorious within: the Saints do not appear to the world
as yet; but when the Witneſſes (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.) ſhall aſcend in a
cloud into heaven, then the enemies ſhall behold them; and
then the Saints ſhall appear as they are, unto the confuſion of
their enemies, which ſhall be very ſhortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now it may be objected,</hi> If it be ſo as you ſay, that the
ſeed of men which are mixed in the State, is the Saints, as you
call them; yet ſure they have done no good: And are they not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted,
and accounted as the worſt of men, becauſe they will not
joyn with the reſt of the body, inſomuch that they are the means to
bring all to confuſion; which if they had held together, it would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98336:9"/>
have been otherwiſe. It is true, that though the State have mixt
themſelves with the ſeed of men, thinking thereby to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Iron, which is the Monarchical power; yet it cannot
be ſo; for iron and clay will not hold together: inſomuch that the
ſtone that was cut out of the mountain hath but ſmote the Image
upon his feet, and hath broken them already. Now here may ariſe
a Queſtion, How it can be proved that there can be more in the
ſeed of men then in the head of gold: for if the ſeed of men be the
Saints in a ſpiritual ſenſe, then the head of gold muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
to be the Truth: and ſo I ſay, How can it be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that there is more excellency in the Saints, who are but men,
then in that whereby they are ſanctified? for Chriſt prays the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thot he would ſanctifie his by the Word; and the Word, ſays
he, is truth.</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer, There is more excellency in the Saints
then in the Truth: I will inſtance in ſome particulars.
Our Saviour in <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaking concerning the doctrine
of the Phariſees, who taught that if any did ſwear by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
it was nothing; but whoſoever ſware by the gold of the
Temple, offended: <hi>ye fools,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for whether is greater, the
gold, or the temple which ſanctifieth the gold?</hi> So by this we ſee
that the Saints are more excellent then the Truth: they are
the temples of the living God, the ſons and daughters of God
Almighty, who do partake of the ſame nature, union, love
and glory as Chriſt our Saviour, our Head and Elder Brother,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. from verſ. 21. unto the end. From the Scripture it
doth clearly appear that the Saints are more excellent then
the Truth it ſelf. But I would not be miſtaken: for I do not
ſpeak here of Truth as God is ſaid to be Truth; nor dare I
ſpeak of it as Chriſt is called the Word of God, as in <hi>Joh. 1.
1. Joh.</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> But I ſpeak of Truth as it is held forth by
the miniſtery of man in Babylon, which appeareth moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
unto to the carnal ſenſe, being held forth by men of
learning and parts, which ſhall fall in the fall of Babylon.</p>
               <p>So, my dear friend, I have followed God in making forth
that which he is pleaſed to convey by me as his inſtrument;
to whom I acknowledge all: for here is <hi>no fleſh to glory in his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98336:10"/>
preſence,</hi> for it is none of mine, the Lord knows: And with
this I ſhall cloſe up, deſiring the Lord will manifeſt himſelf
unto you, in diſcovering thoſe things which are hidden from
the world, who, when they think of peace and ſafety, the
day of the Lord comes upon them as a thief in the night. But
I may ſay of you, as the Apoſtle did of the <hi>Theſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

more then ever, in making his to know that now, which

that the feet and toes of the great Image is one State? How
can it be confined to that Parliament of England which is come to
confuſion? for it is evident the Scripture ſpeaks of divers Kings
which are the feet and toes: for it is ſaid in the laſt days of theſe
Kings, ſpeaking of the laſt powers, which is the feet and toes, that
the God of heaven ſhall ſet up a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer, that if we wreſt the Propheſies to
the Letter, the feet and toes appear to be divers Kings, even
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98336:10"/>
ten in number, anſwering to the ten horns that ſupport the
beaſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. Howſoever, we have no warrant
from the Scripture for any ſuch interpretation, the Scripture
being altogether ſilent: there is an interpretation given of the
reſt of the four Monarchs; but for the Monarchical power
which is in the mixture of the feet and toes, there is no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
given, but its own acts, which the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 11. Now in the Letter, the four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
ſpoken of <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. which was firſt the King of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
the head of gold, and ſo the other three Monarchies
ſucceſſively as the Scripture ſpeaketh it, needs no interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe it is clear in the letter: but howſoever, all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
muſt have a ſpiritual interpretation; for if it ſhould
be confined to the letter, there would follow great abſurdities;
becauſe when the feet of the great Image are broken, the iron
and clay, braſſe, ſilver &amp; gold, falls all together, and becomes as
the chaff of the ſummer-floor: whereas it is well known, that
the Babylonian Monarchy, and the other two following, are
fallen; the laſt is fallen in good part, before the feet and toes
are broken, which in the letter are ſaid to be broken in the firſt
place, by the ſtone which is cut out of the mountain. And ſo
it is clear that the great Image ſpoken of <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. is to be
underſtood otherwiſe then we have formerly: and certainly
it will appear to be that Image of Babel that the Lord will
viſit, <hi>Jerem. 51. 47, 52<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Now the Image or Images of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
are not to be underſtood in the letter, that is, ſuch things
as we count Images, for they are not capable of viſiting or
puniſhing; but is to be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and ſo
whatſoever is ſpoken here in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. concerning this great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
whoſe head was of gold, and his breſt and arms of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
is to be accompliſhed in myſtical Babylon; and ſo in the
firſt place, the head of this great Image, which is of gold,
doth concern the ſpiritual excellencies which do appear in
myſtical Babylon, in reſpect of the glorious truths which have
been held forth by the Saints, but in confuſion, which is Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 51. where it is ſaid that Babylon hath been as a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
cup in the Lords hand; the nations have drunken of her
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98336:11"/>
wine, therefore do the nations rage: and it is evident that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
in the Saints, which is the head of gold, is lifted up very
high, in reſpect of thoſe unſpeakable comforts that the Saints
have in the apprehenſion of the truth which is held forth by
Babylon, in that it is ſaid, <hi>How art thou fallen from heaven, O
Lucifer, ſon of the morning,</hi> Iſai. 14.</p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken of Babylon in the Saints, which is
the head of gold, now I ſhall ſpeak of Babylon in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which may be very fitly compared to the breſt and arms
of the great Image, which are of ſilver. I ſpeak of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
which are held forth in the pureſt manner, even
thoſe which are moſt agreeable to the letter of the Word, even
that element that melts with fervent heat, which is a degree
below Babylon in the Saints, which is the head of gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now it may be objected,</hi> How can the breſt and arms,
which are of ſilver, ſignifie the Ordinances, whereas the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in it ſelf is but a vail or ſhadow, and ſilver is a pure metal,
though not ſo eſteemed of as gold?</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer; Though the Ordinance in it ſelf is but
a ſhadow, and ſo Babylon, yet no queſtion but that there are
ſome glorious truths held forth, which may be compared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſilver; though the gold and ſilver it ſelf ſhall fall in the fall
of Babylon.</p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken of the head of gold, and the breſt
and arms, which are ſilver; next I ſhall ſpeak of the belly
and thiths, which are of braſſe, that may very well ſignifie
the counterfeit truths which were held forth in the National
Church of <hi>England,</hi> as touching Diſcipline. I may very well
ſay they are altogether counterfeit, becauſe they have no rule
from the Word for what they practiſe, neither for the calling
of the Miniſtery, nor the inſtitution of ſuch a Church.</p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken concerning what is to be underſtood
of the Image of Babel in reference to the Saints, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and that counterfeit Church which was amongſt
us, now I ſhall ſpeak concerning thoſe parts of the Image
that concern the ſtate in which Babylon hath begun to fall;
and in the firſt place I ſhall ſpeak of the Monarchical power,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98336:11"/>
of this mixture of the feet and toes, even that power which
rules in the tenth part of the great City, which is myſtical Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now ſome may object, That</hi> Babylon is everywhere,
and ſo not to be confined unto any State.</p>
               <p>Unto this I anſwer; It is true that Babylon cannot be
confined; yet the Scripture is clear, that whatſoever is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of that Babylon wherein the Witneſſes are ſlain, <hi>Rev. 11.
Jer.</hi> 50 and 51, or where the Saints are in bondage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now
this Babylon ſpoken in theſe Scriptures, is the tenth part of
the great City, which is <hi>ſpiritually called Sodom and Egypt,
where our Lord was crucified,</hi> as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. which doth evidently
appear to be this Iſland of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as I have formerly
written. Now as for the Monarchical power that hath been
acted in the tenth part of the great City immediately before
its fall, it is well known to be before quoted <hi>Dan. 2, 7, 8, 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Chap. The Scripture will ſpeak it forth, to be an arbitrary
power, which hath evidently appeared to be in this Iſland:
which arbitrary power hath not onely been in the Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

did in its ſpecial manner appear to be that glorious State ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. and not onely have ſpiritual excellencies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in her, but ſhe hath appeared to be Babylon in ſpecial
manner, and in particular, the violence done unto the Saints:
remember <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Anno. Dom. 1647<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the inhabitants of Caldea do go on to fill up the
meaſure of their ſin, in the perſecuting of the Saints, to the
haſtening of the dreadful indignation of that God, who is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but love in his own nature, but conſuming fire to his
enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another Objection may ariſe. Some may ſay,</hi> What is the
reaſon that you do give the ſpiritual meaning of the head of gold,
and the breſt of ſilver, and the belly of braſſe, and do onely give
a literal ſignification of the legs of iron, and the feet and toes of
iron and clay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for the three former, they have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
already in the letter, and the fourth almoſt, though
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98336:12"/>
there is ſome of it remains behinde, concerning which we
muſt give literal interpretation, before the ſpiritual meaning
ſhall be made known. Now as for the literal intepretation
of the legs, feet and toes of the great Image, and the ſpiritual
interpretation of the head, breſt and belly, all this is to be
accompliſhed in a ſpiritual and literal ſenſe together; and
the ſpiritual meaning of the legs, feet and toes, ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
in the Kingdom of the Saints. And with this I ſhall
end this diſcourſe.</p>

tribulation: for ſure I am moſt ſtrong in God, when I am
weakeſt in my ſelf; and more enabled to act by the Spirit,
when I am moſt ſtraightned in the fleſh; and <hi>having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
in viſible appearance, in the enjoyment of the Saints,
or any other ſpiritual or temporal comforts, <hi>yet I poſſeſſe all
things</hi> in my God, in whom I live, and he in me; and my
joy and conſolation is not in my ſelf, in that I live in God, in
mine own particular; but my joy is the joy of you all; for
ſure my ſoul is bound up with yours in the ſame bundle, as the
Apoſtle ſays: I am alive, if you ſtand faſt in theſe terrible
times, wherein <hi>the powers of heaven</hi> are <hi>ſhaken,</hi> and not onely
the powers of heaven ſhaken in the Saints, but heaven it ſelf
is <hi>paſſing away with a great noiſe, and the element melts with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
heat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here I ſhall, God aſſiſting, make forth that which I
have formerly written, which for the preſent I am deprived
of; howſoever, I do here depend upon his help, who I am ſure
will give it in again, ſo far as it is ſpiritual, enabling me to
communicate it for the benefit of others, ſo far as it ſhall ſtand
with his glory: which Writing did conſiſt of divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the ſtate of the Church of God in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
in reſpect of that wonderful tribulation before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98336:13"/>
out of Babylon, and her being gathered out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
and her being brought into the wilderneſſe after her
deliverance, and the glorious ſtate of the Church which
ſhall follow: concerning all which particulars, moſt of the
Saints will joyn with me; onely this wilderneſſe-condition
is lookt on as moſt diſconſolate, inſomuch that the Saints
themſelves may think as the children of Iſrael, that it is beſt
for them to continue ſtill in Babylon; eſpecially thoſe who
do not onely live under the Ordinances, but in them, in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ſenſible conſolation, which I am ſure is not ſpiritual,
inſomuch that it may well be compared to the fleſh-pots of
Egypt.</p>
            <p>Now as for the former Writing, ſo far as God ſhall enable
me, I ſhall here make it forth, and ſo ſhew how far the Saints
do joyn with me, and where we differ. Now all the people
of God will agree in this, that the Lord will gather his people
out of Babylon, in bringing them out of Darkneſſe and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
they do likewiſe expect a glorious ſtate of the Church;
but in contrariety of judgements one from another, which is
moſt in circumſtances, and not in ſubſtance. Now the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
judgements of the Saints are as followeth.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, and ſo in that they do moſt agree, which
is concerning this new heaven and earth that we do expect,
which is conceived ſhall not be till all theſe old things ſhall
paſſe away: And they do likewiſe expect an utter diſſolution
of this viſible heaven and earth, and ſo after that, the glorious
ſtate of the Church follows. Others likewiſe do conceive
that the Jews ſhall be converted to the Faith, before the end.
And ſo concerning the glorious ſtate of the Church, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it in a ſpiritual ſenſe; yet ſome do not deny but that
there ſhall be a temporal power which ſhall go forth from
the Saints, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 16, 17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. which is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Saints that is begun even here in Babylon, amongſt
their implacable enemies, as <hi>Mic.</hi> 4. from verſ. 8. unto the end,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 41. Now I ſhall not undertake to confute any of
theſe particulars by force of Argument, but I ſhall ſhew how
far I can joyn with them, and where I differ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98336:13"/>
Now in the firſt place, Whereas the Saints do expect a
diſſolution of all things at the laſt day, when <hi>the Son of man
ſhall come in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory,</hi> and
all the Saints with him in like manner, who ſhall be gathered
together by the ſound of a trumpet, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4 and 5 Chap. concerning which time, the Scriptures
are as follow, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2. towards the end; <hi>Iſa. 13. Iſa. 51. 6. Iſa.

                  </gap>.</hi> 20. all which
Scriptures, and many more, ſpeak of the day of Judgement:
and unto this I will aſſent, in that I do verily believe that the
glorious ſtate of the Church ſhall not be until all theſe things
be fulfilled which are ſpoken in theſe Scriptures; as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
ſaith, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but my word
ſhall not paſſe away;</hi> for that cannot be ſhaken, becauſe it is
the foundation of the new heaven and the new earth, as <hi>Iſa.</hi>
51. 16. which is not to be underſtood of the written Word;
for that ſhall paſſe away when all things are fulfilled. Now
that Word of God which continues for ever, is God himſelf,
as <hi>Joh. 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and that Word was God:</hi> ſo that as God was from all
eternity, ſo this Word of God continues to all eternity; and
ſure this Word begins to be manifeſted in the Saints, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.
though it hath been a long time hidden. Howſoever, though
I do joyn in this, that the glorious ſtate of the Church ſhall
not be till theſe viſible things are paſſed away; yet I differ
from them in the matter which ſhall paſſe away, and in the
manner how it ſhall paſſe away, and by what means it ſhall
paſſe away. Now that matter which ſhall paſſe away, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
conceived to be this viſible heaven and earth, at the laſt
day; and by what means, by fire, and in what manner, it is
made forth at large, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the day of
the Lord ſhall come as a thief in the night, wherein the heavens
ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, and the element ſhall melt with
fervent heat, and the earth with the works therein ſhall be burnt
up.</hi> Now I ſay I do differ in all theſe particulars in ſome ſenſe:
for I differ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, in the matter which ſhall paſſe away: for I do not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98336:14"/>
conceive that theſe viſible heavens ſhall be diſſolved, and ſo
conſequently of that which follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto this ſome may reply,</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle Peter
ſpeak plainly that the heavens and earth are reſerved to fire againſt
the day of judgement and perdition of wicked and ungodly men?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, If you do obſerve the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in
the words foregoing, you ſhall finde that he makes diſtinction
between the world that periſhed by water, and the heavens
and earth which now are, which are ſaid to be reſerved to fire:
whereas this viſible heaven and earth, as it is underſtood in the
letter to be the firmament, and the earth that we live in, as it
was diſtinguiſhed in the Creation, it is the ſame as it was from
the beginning, as the mockers ſay, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. Now whereas the
Apoſtle makes this diſtinction between the heaven and earth
which was before the flood, and the heaven and earth that
now is, whereas it is the ſame in the letter, none will deny; I
ſay, from this diſtinction of the Apoſtle in this Scripture, and
many other Scriptures which joyn in this, I do conclude
that theſe Scriptures, which we have formerly conceived to
concern the diſſolution of this viſible heaven and earth, do
onely concern the paſſing away of the Ordinances, which is
that heaven wherein God hath appeared gloriouſly, unto the
unſpeakable conſolation of the Saints: and this earth here
ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the beſt part of man, as his natural wiſdom, and
humane learning, and gifts, not onely common gifts, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
gifts, whereby they are enabled to ſpeak unto edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which may be comprehended under the ſame notion; for
the Apoſtle ſpeaks as if the wicked may have the common
gifts of the Spirit. Now thoſe gifts that the Saints have been
carried forth in of late, do evidently appear to be that element
which melts with ſervent heat. But here you may obſerve,
that though heaven in our ſenſe is thus on fire 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12. yet
it is but diſſolved, and the element is but melted onely: here
is a difference between heaven and the element; for heaven
onely ceaſeth to be in that manner as it was in groſſe, yet
there is no alteration in the nature of it: as when we ſay the
Parliament is diſſolved, the men continue the ſame, onely it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98336:14"/>
ceaſeth to be a body Politick; and likewiſe our precious Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
(as <hi>Bezer</hi>) are not effectual to our good, untill they be
diſſolved into ſome liquid matter: ſo God, who is our heaven
in the Ordinance; for there can be no heaven without him:
And ſo when God, which is our heaven, ſhall be thus diſſolved,
and ceaſe being covered with a vail, then this vail ſhall vaniſh
away like ſmoke, which vail is the Ordinance; and heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſſolved, the Saints are in a capacity to contain this heaven
in the fleſh; and ſurely God, who is our heaven, ſhall appear
in the fleſh of all his Saints ſhortly, in his glorious manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
for, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>We, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
look for a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteouſneſſe;</hi> which is not a heaven without us, as before, in
the Ordinances and the teachings of men, but it is a heaven
within us, even God manifeſted in the fleſh of his Saints, as
in the humanity of Chriſt. Now the Saints ſtand in the
ſame relation to God as our elder brother Chriſt, whilſt they
are in the ſtate of imperfection, as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are the
ſons of God, but it doth not appear what we ſhall be: but when
he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is,
and then are the ſons of God manifeſt.</hi> Now we ſee that we
are no loſers, though our heaven being on fire hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved:
for now we have our heaven within us, that cannot
be ſhaken; but our heaven without us hath been ſhaken, which
is the Ordinance, and hath likewiſe been taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for
when God withdraws, and doth not appear in it, then all is
gone. But howſoever, here is matter of unſpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to the Saints, even at this time wherein the powers of
heaven are ſhaken, and ſhall likewiſe vaniſh away; becauſe
that which remains cannot be ſhaken, though it be diſſolved,
ceaſing to appear in that manner as formerly, as covered with
a vail; but now we ſhall ſee face to face.</p>
            <p>Now having ſpoken at large concerning the heavens being
on fire, which is diſſolved to ſome, and ſhall be diſſolved to
all, when the Saints ſhall ſee God as he is, becauſe the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
which is that vail that hath hid the glory of God from
us whilſt we live ſo lowe in the earth, is taken away; becauſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98336:15"/>
we could not ſee God and live, except he had been ſo covered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but when this vail ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoke, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. and
<hi>be rolled together like a ſcroll,</hi> Revel. 6. 14. and every mountain
and hill ſhall be removed out of his place, and heaven ſhall be
ſhaken, and the earth ſhall be removed out of his place in the
wrath of the Lord, <hi>Iſa. 13. 13, 14. Heb.</hi> 12, God ſaith, that
<hi>once more I will not ſhake earth onely, but alſo heaven.</hi> Now this
<hi>once more</hi> ſignifies the removing of thoſe things which are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that the things which cannot be ſhaken may remain.
And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but
my word ſhall not paſſe away,</hi> which is God himſelf. Now that
which vaniſheth and paſſeth away, and is ſhaken and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
as in theſe Scriptures here quoted; heaven which is here
ſpoken of is the Ordinances, which ſhall paſſe away when
God appeareth in his glorious manifeſtations, when he comes
<hi>into his Temple,</hi> Mal. 3. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is ſaid, <hi>Who can abid
his coming, and who ſhall ſtand when he appeareth?</hi> Heaven
paſſeth away now with a great noiſe: there is great trouble
in the Saints when this ſhall be. Now heaven, which is the
Word of God, in diſtinction to that heaven which paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with a great noiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 10. though this heaven, which is the
word of God, ſhall be diſſolved, it remains the ſame in nature,
though not in ſuch a groſſe ſubſtance: Now when it is thus
diſſolved, there is more ſpiritual efficacy in it then before, in
that this Word ſhall become fleſh, as is ſpoken of Chriſt,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. And ſo, as the Word of God did become fleſh in
Chriſt our elder brother, ſo this Word ſhall become fleſh in
all the Saints, when God ſhall be manifeſted in their fleſh, and
they likewiſe ſhall be declared mightily to be the ſons of God,
by the Reſurrection from the dead; not the Reſurrection of
the body natural, which we do not expect in that manner as
formerly we conceived, but the reſurrection from the dead in a
ſpiritual ſenſe. Now concerning the reſurrection of the bodies
of the Saints which is expected after their natural death, it is
to me a myſtry as yet, and ſo I conceive it is to moſt of the
Saints. As for that reſurrection which is held forth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
in the Scripture, it is in part made known unto me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:98336:15"/>
to be dead with Chriſt, and ſo to be riſen with him. Now
to be dead with Chriſt, the Apoſtle ſaith is to be dead unto the
Ordinances, and all vails and ſhadows; and to be riſen with
him, is to live in God, in ſeeing eye to eye, when God ſhall
bring again Sion, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52. And ſo that reſurrection which
we do expect, is not the reſurrection after death, but a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in a ſpiritual ſenſe, whilſt we are in the fleſh, before
the ſtate of glory; and it is a reſurrection out of a ſpiritual
defection which we have been brought into, being ſlain by our
iniquity, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. where God ſaith, <hi>O Ephraim, thou haſt
deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> Onely here is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the cauſe of the death of Chriſt, and the cauſe of this
death in the Saints in a ſpiritual ſenſe. Now the cauſe of the
death of Chriſt, was the ſin of mankinde, as the Scripture
ſpeaketh: but the Saints are ſlain by their own ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now here will ariſe a Queſtion,</hi> How can it be ſaid that the
Saints are ſlain by their iniquities, ſeeing Chriſt hath ſatisfied for
the ſins of the whole world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, the ſatisfaction which was in Chriſt, it
was a ſufficient ranſome; for in that the whole Creation is
redeemed from the curſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aw: and if all did believe,
all ſhould have benefit by this redemption: for it is evident
that none are damned, but for the ſin of unbelief, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
declares in divers places. So howſoever, though there
be ſuch a ſufficient ranſome, yet none have benefit by it, but
thoſe who do believe, and unto them the guilt and maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſin is taken away: but though the guilt and maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſin be taken away by this redemption, and ſo the Saints
cannot be ſlain by their iniquity, in reſpect of the ſpiritual
man; yet they are ſlain in their own apprehenſion, when they
are bereft of all joy and comfort in the ſpirit, in that God hath
withdrawn himſelf from them: And here it may be ſaid they
are put to death with Chriſt, in that they are conformable to
his ſufferings, in reſpect of the ſpiritual deſertion that Chriſt
was in, <hi>who in the days of his fleſh did pour out ſtrong prayers
with crying and tears,</hi> as in the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> and ſo likewiſe the
Saints are to be conformable to Chriſt their Head, in being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98336:16"/>
ſlain by the cruel hatred of the wicked, in reſpect of reproach,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo the Saints may be ſaid to be ſlain with Chriſt,
when they are ſlain by their iniquities, as in the firſt Chapter
of <hi>Hoſea; When Ephraim ſaw his ſickneſſe, and Judah his wound,
then went Ephraim to the Aſſyrian, and ſent to king Jareb; yet
could be not heal nor cure him of his wound: for, ſaith God, I
will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the houſe of
Iſrael: I will tear and go away; I will take away, and none ſhall
reſcue.</hi> And then God returns to his place until they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their offences: in their afflictions they will ſeek
him early. And ſo the reſurrection of Chriſt follows in the
ſixth Chapter, where thoſe which are thus ſlain in a ſpiritual
ſenſe, take unto themſelves theſe words, and ſay, <hi>Come, let
us return unto the Lord: for he hath wounded, and he will heal;
after two days he will revive us, and the third day we ſhall live in
his ſight.</hi> So in <hi>Hoſ. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it is ſaid that <hi>Ephraim had deſtroyed
himſelf,</hi> as we may ſee in the words following, in that death
follows: for it is ſaid, that <hi>Ephraim was an unwiſe ſon: for
he ſhould not have ſtood ſtill in the breaking forth of children; but
he doth ſtand ſtill;</hi> and in ſtanding ſtill he dieth. But what
ſaith God? <hi>I will ranſome him from the power of the grave, I
will redeem him from death: O death, I will be thy plague;
O grave, I will be thy deſtruction: repentance ſhall be hid from
mine eyes.</hi> Howſoever, all his former fruitfulneſſe ſhall be
blown away, as in the words following in the next Chapter,
where thoſe which are thus ranſomed as before, take unto
themſelves theſe words, and ſay, <hi>They ſhall no more look unto
Idols, they ſhall no more ſeek unto Aſhur,</hi> nor any carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>but they ſhall wait on the Lord, and in him ſhall they truſt.</hi>
And thoſe who have attained unto a reſurrection with Chriſt,
if they go on to know the Lord, <hi>he ſhall return as the rain, and
as the later rain upon the earth.</hi> And thoſe that ſhall attain
unto this reſurrection as before ſpoken, <hi>ſhall grow up as calves
in the ſtall,</hi> as <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. And thoſe likewiſe which are thus ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
with Chriſt, ſhall be ſecured in the chamber ſpoken of in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. in reſpect of the ſpiritual man, whilſt the Lord comes
out of his place to deſtroy the works of the fleſh in us, which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98336:16"/>
are the inhabitants of the earth in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and the
chamber is God himſelf, wherein the ſpiritual man liveth in
ſecurity and peace, even that man-childe ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.
who is <hi>caught up to God, and to his throne;</hi> which man-childe
ſhall rule all nations with a rod of iron; even this ſpiritual
man ſhall be ſecured when the heavens are ſhaken, and the
earth is removed out of its place; yea, the ſpiritual man in
thoſe who are living at the coming of Chriſt, which never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in reſpect of the ſpiritual deſertions; even that part of the
Church which doth remain when two parts are cut off and
die, as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 18. from verſ. 8. to the end. I ſay, the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
man both in thoſe that are riſen at the coming of Chriſt,
with thoſe that are riſen from the dead, ſhall be caught up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. Now theſe clouds
are not the clouds of the air, but the clouds of heaven, which
are the Saints themſelves, which ſhall witneſſe that all this is
done: Chriſt's being taken up into the clouds of this viſible
firmament, did typifie the taking up of the Saints ſpiritually
unto God, concerning which we have a cloud of witneſſes in
the Saints; and accordingly do expect Chriſt coming in glory
ſpiritually, and all his Saints with him, as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>Now having ſpoken at large concerning the heavens being
diſſolved, which remains the ſame in nature, though it ceaſeth
to be in that manner as before; and having likewiſe ſpoken
of the Saints being dead and riſen with Chriſt ſpiritually:
Now in the next place I ſhall make forth, ſo far as God ſhall
reveal, that which followeth.</p>
            <p>And in the firſt place, concerning thoſe elements which
melt with fervent heat, which certainly is to be underſtood to
be the glorious truths which are held forth in Babylon, in
which there is great mixture of Errour, that may very well
be compared unto that head of gold, and the breſt and arms of
ſilver of the great Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. which ſhall be tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by the
fire of the Spirit: and though the truths cannot burn yet they
ſhall be melted, and the fire ſhall try every mans work, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be of God or no: and I am ſure, <hi>if any man build on the
foundation wood, hay or ſtubble, it ſhall be burnt</hi> up with this fire,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98336:17"/>
which tries and refines the Truths and the Saints; and ſo the
melting of theſe elements, which are the Truth, ſhall but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them as ſilver, and purifie them as gold; and ſo it loſeth
nothing but droſſe, which is the earth and the works thereof
that ſhall be burnt up, as follows in this Scripture; which
burning we have formerly conceived to be the utter conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this viſible earth in which we live; but now we
finde it otherwiſe, in that the books which were ſealed begin
now to be opened, even that which was hidden from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf as man, who ſpeaks
concerning the end of the world, that <hi>of that day and hour
knoweth no man, but the Father onely:</hi> but when God ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in his glorious manifeſtations in the Saints, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God ſhall behold the glory of the Saints, when the
Lord ſhall make bare his holy arm in the ſight of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and <hi>all the ends of the earth ſhall behold the ſalvation of the
Lord,</hi> Iſa. 52. but unto their horrour and amazement, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.
So you ſee that the earth before ſpoken of, which ſhall be
burnt up, is not the earth we live in, which is harmleſſe in it
ſelf; for ſure it can do no evil, but by the bleſſing of God it
doth much good, though not of it ſelf, yet according to the
providence of God, who maketh the ſun to ſhine and the rain
to fall, that the earth may bring forth fruit: and ſure every
creature of God is good in its kinde, and therefore the earth
cannot be ſaid to be evil, nor her works evil, and accordingly
it ſhall not be burnt up; for the curſe is taken from the earth,
in that redemption that was in Chriſt: and in that the earth is
not fruitful, but brings forth briars and thorns, and the like,
it is not becauſe the earth is evil, but onely a juſt judgement
of God, to make a fruitful Land barren for the ſins of them
that dwell in it: and ſo we cannot finde in Scripture that this
viſible heaven and earth are to have an end; for we finde to
the contrary, that they are to continue, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 25. and
35. 36. and likewiſe it is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> and in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi>
that the earth endureth for ever; and ſo where it is ſaid, that
<hi>the heavens and earth that now are, are kept by the ſame word in
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore, reſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgement and perdition
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98336:17"/>
of wicked and ungodly men,</hi> this ye ſee is to be underſtood o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
then hath been formerly.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall make forth in brief concerning thoſe things
which do remain, according as God ſhall reveal the meaning
of this Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now in the firſt place, where it is ſaid, that <hi>the heavens
and earth which now are,</hi> in diſtinction from that heaven and
earth which were before the flood; which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it in the letter, is the ſame as it was from the Creation;
and therefore, as I have before ſpoken, <hi>the heaven and earth
which now is,</hi> is to be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe, as, the
<hi>heavens</hi> to be the glorious Ordinance wherein God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and the <hi>earth</hi> to be wiſdom, and gifts, and the like;
theſe heavens and earth are to be <hi>reſerved to fire againſt the day
of judgement of wicked and ungodly men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto this ſome may object,</hi> How can this heaven and earth
you ſpeak of be reſerved to fire for the deſtruction of wicked men,
whereas the Saints ſuffer the judgements of God in this kinde, and
the wicked and ungodly are freed?</p>
            <p>Unto this I anſwer, <hi>Judgement begins at the houſe of God,</hi>
as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; <hi>and if it begin at the houſe of God, where ſhall
the wicked and ungodly appear? and if it be thus with the green
tree, what ſhall become of the dry?</hi> But howſoever though this
fire with which God doth judge fleſh in his Saints, as it is in
<hi>Iſa. 66. the Lord doth judge with fire and the ſword all fleſh,</hi> in
the firſt place: ſo I ſay this fire breaks forth in the houſe of God,
unto the deſtruction of the fleſh; and ſo you ſee the benefit that
comes by it. Now this deſtruction of the fleſh, it is not to
be underſtood in the letter, but fleſh in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and ſo
the works of the earth likewiſe. Now fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh in the Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s is
that earth which ſhall be burnt up in ſome, by the fire of the
Spirit, which hath diſſolved heaven, and hath melted
the elements, and burnt up the earth with the works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
even that which remains when the pure metal is refined
and ſeparated from it. Now this earth, as before I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
is the beſt part of man, as his Reaſon, Natural Wiſdom,
and Learning: Now as the fire of the Spirit diſſolves heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98336:18"/>
and melts the elements, and burns up the earth, which is the
fleſh in the Saints: ſo the fiery trials which are inflicted upon
the people of God whilſt they are in Babylon, do effect the
ſame work as the fire of the Spirit, though it doth not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to our apprehenſion. Now when this is done, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is the Word of God, is diſſolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ceaſing to appear
in a ſhadow, which is to ſee Chriſt in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh; now we do
enjoy heaven more ſpiritually, in that we have more ſpiritual
diſcerning; and Truth, which was our element, hath been
refined, and hath loſt nothing but its droſſe; and the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
burnt up in the Saints, when all this is accompliſhed in
the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> How can it be ſaid that the heavens and earth that
now are, which is the Ordinances, as before ſpoken, can be reſerved
to fire againſt the day of judgement and perdition of wicked and
ungodly men?</p>
            <p>Unto this I anſwer; It is, howſoever it may appear: for
now heaven is paſſing away with a great noiſe, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are melting with fervent heat, and the earth and the
works thereof are burning up, which is all accompliſhing in
the Saints; and at this time the Church of God is in a ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
for the ſorrows of a travelling woman are come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. nay, the
pangs of death are upon her; and ſure it is not an eaſie matter
for the ſoul to part from the body; and it is no otherwiſe
when we muſt part from all our former comforts; and ſo
when the Saints are under theſe fiery trials, the dolorous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of them cannot be expreſſed: at this time the hateful ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of God, the inhabitants of Caldea, do adde unto their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
and in doing ſo, they do procure damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<hi>whoſe judgement</hi> (as <hi>Judge</hi> ſaith) <hi>of a long time ſlumbreth
not;</hi> where he ſpeaks of <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> who
propheſied of theſe things, <hi>Behold the Lord cometh with ten
thouſand of his Saints, to execute judgement,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo you
ſee that theſe heavens and earth are reſerved to fire againſt the
day of judgement and the perdition of the wicked. And
ſurely the long-ſuffering of of God, in that the heavens and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98336:18"/>
earth have not paſſed away long ago, is, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>
ſaith, <hi>ſalvation to us-ward,</hi> in that God was not willing that
any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould be ſaved: that is, God
will offer ſalvation to all, and for this reaſon this heavens and
earth are continued, which is the Ordinances, and the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Saints, becauſe, God appearing in them, they are
the ordinary means of ſalvation: for, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>faith cometh by hearing</hi> the Word of God preached: and
certainly, though there have been much of earth made forth
by the miniſtery of men, yet there is ſomewhat of God, ſo
much as is neceſſary to ſalvation. And ſo when this heaven
and earth which is reſerved to fire in reference to the Saints,
ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, and the element ſhall melt
with fervent heat, according as before it is ſpoken, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
follows the perdition of wicked and ungodly men:
for when heaven is paſſed away, and vaniſht away, and taken
away, which is the Ordinance, then there remains no more
means of grace in an ordinary way, but howſoever no doubt
but God will work extraordinarily in bringing in thoſe who
are heirs of ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now another reaſon why the perdition of wicked and
ungodly men followeth immediately upon the paſſing away
of the Ordinances, is, Becauſe when God is refining his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in deſtroying the fleſh in them, he doth make uſe of the
wrath of men, who do fill up the meaſure of their ſin, by their
cruel uſage of the Saints: but ſure <hi>the wrath of man ſhall turn
to the praiſe of God,</hi> and the remainder of wrath will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain:
and when God hath finiſhed his work on mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whilſt they are in Babylon, and ſo ſhall have gathered his
people from all places whither they have been led captive in
reſpect of a local ſeparation from their hateful enemies, then
he will viſit the proud heart of the King of Babylon, and then
the violence which hath been done unto the Saints, ſhall be on
Babylon, ſhall the inhabitants of Sion ſay, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. and
our blood be on the inhabitants of Caldea, ſhall Jeruſalem
fay. And ſo when heaven and earth are paſſed away, and the
Saints gathered away, then follows the deſtruction of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98336:19"/>
wicked. The Scriptures to prove it are many; as in <hi>Iſa. 13.
14. &amp;c. Jer. 50, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 44. and 51. 45. <hi>Mic. 4. Rev.</hi> 18. This is
the day of judgement and perdition of wicked and ungodly
men.</p>
            <p>Now having ſpoken, ſo far as God hath carried me forth,
concerning the former particulars; I ſhall come to the next
as it lieth in order, which is concerning the glorious ſtate of
the Church that ſhall not be until the Jews are converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Faith. Unto this I do agree with thoſe of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
howſoever we differ concerning whom thoſe Jews
are which ſhall be converted. Now as God hath made known
to me, I conceive that thoſe Jews which are to be converted,
are not the natural Jews: for we know there are no natural
Jews, in that they are mixt among all Nations. But let it be
granted that there are; yet it can be proved that the ten Tribes
did never return out of Captivity, and ſo likewiſe they have
no Genealogie: howſoever I do not deny but that there are a
remnant of thoſe people according to the election of grace.
But the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpeaks moſt of the converſion of
the Jews, ſpeaks by the ſpirit of prophecie: and ſure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles, though they ſpake by the inſpiration of
the Spirit, yet they did ſee no further then the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Prophecies in the letter, in that the ſpiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was ſhut up until the end of time, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. You
ſhall finde that when the Apoſtle had ſpoken at large concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the calling of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. when he had ſpoken all
which God had revealed by the Spirit, he breaks forth in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
admiration; <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and
knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgements, and
his ways paſt finding out!</hi> And ſo when we read in Scripture
concerning the calling of the Jews, it muſt of neceſſity be
confined to the <hi>Iſrael of God;</hi> not <hi>Iſrael in the fleſh,</hi> but the
Iſrael according to election, who are the children of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the promiſe, which conſiſt both of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:
for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, that <hi>he is not a Jew which
is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion which is Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the fleſh: but Circumciſion is of the heart, not of the letter,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98336:19"/>
whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith
likewiſe, <hi>All are not Iſrael, which are of Iſrael; but in Iſaac
ſhall thy ſeed be called:</hi> So the children of the promiſe are
counted for the ſeed. And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. it is ſaid, that <hi>the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
have attained what they ſought for;</hi> but the election have
attained it, and <hi>the reſt were hardened.</hi> But and if you will
needs have it to be the Nation of the Jews which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
it cannot be the natural Jews, becauſe they are mixt
amongſt the Heathens. Why then it muſt needs be a Jew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to profeſſion: Why then if it be ſo, we ſee a good
part of the Jews by profeſſion converted to the Faith already;
and the Lord will make a ſhort work in the earth: For do you
not ſee many of the Iſrael of God which have been under the
bondage of the Law, in entering into Church-fellowſhip?
and do not we ſee that God does begin to diſcover unto them
their errour, in thinking that they were under the Goſpel, and
ſo poſſeſt of the ſubſtance? but now they finde, unto their
ſorrow, that it was but a ſhadow, in that it vaniſhed away.
But howſoever, the comfort is, the Lord does begin to <hi>pour
upon the houſe of David and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of prayer and ſupplication:</hi> and though they are in ſadneſſe in
the conſideration of what they have done, and ſo <hi>look upon him
whom they have pierced,</hi> and <hi>ſhall be in bitterneſſe for him, as one
that is in bitterneſſe for his onely ſon;</hi> and <hi>in that day there ſhall
be great mourning in Jeruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the valley of Megiddo, as in</hi> Zech. 12. from verſ. 10. to
the end; but though (I ſay) it be thus with the Saints at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
there is a joyful day at hand, when <hi>the Lord ſhall return
their Captivity as the rivers in the South.</hi> And ſo whatſoever
is ſpoken concerning the return of the children of Iſrael out
of Captivity, it is to be underſtood of Iſrael in the ſpirit. And
whereas the Scripture ſpeaks in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Tribes
which are to be ſealed, it is to be underſtood likewiſe in this
ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Now as for the judgement that is given unto the Saints, the
glorious ſtate of the Church, it conſiſts moſt of all in reſpect
of ſpirituals; though I do not deny but that there ſhall be a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98336:20"/>
temporal power, which is begun already: for the Kingdom
is begun even here in Babylon, among the implacable enemies
of God, as in <hi>Dan. 2. Mic.</hi> 4. Now I do joyn with the Saints
in this their judgement; though I muſt go further: for it will
appear, that though the Kingdom is begun in Babylon, yet it
ſhall not ſtand in Babylon, which is Confuſion; but it is clear
that God will gather his people out of Babylon, for divers
Reaſons.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, Becauſe they are to be diſtinguiſhed from other
people, in that God will appear in them in glory; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be here in Babylon, in that the Saints here are <hi>as black as
pots,</hi> they are <hi>the off-ſcowring of all things,</hi> they are vile in name,
and ſore in affliction, even as Chriſt when he was on earth;
but <hi>when he ſhall appear, we ſhall appear with him in glory;</hi> and
certainly <hi>the whole earth ſhall be full of the ſalvation of the Lord,</hi>
his holy arm in delivering his people, which cannot be until
he ſhall gather us from amongſt our enemies, and ſo go before
us himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now another Reaſon is, why God will gather his people
from all places whither they have been led captive; Becauſe
the Saints cannot ſing <hi>the Song of Moſes and the Lamb,</hi> until
the Lord hath given a full deliverance to his Church, and
brought them into the wilderneſſe ſpoken of in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 14.
And ſure the Lord hath denounced to bring utter deſtruction
on Babylon, which aſſuredly ſhall come to paſſe: and the
Lord can do nothing in this kinde, until he have gathered his
people out from amongſt them. Now the Scriptures to
prove the gathering away of the Saints out of Babylon, and
the utter deſtruction that follows, are, <hi>Iſai.</hi> the 13, 14, 50, 51,
and 52 Chap. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. Now the Scriptures which do
ſpeak of the wilderneſſe that the Lord will gather his people
into when they are delivered out of Babylon, are likewiſe
many: in which wilderneſſe, though there ſhall be nothing in
ſight in reſpect of ſpirituals and temporals, yet the glory of
Lebanon ſhall be brought into it, and the fruitfulneſſe of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.
Now this wilderneſſe which is propheſied of, that ſhall
be a receptable to the Saints, it was never yet accompliſhed in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98336:20"/>
the letter, and therefore we do verily expect to have it accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
both in the letter, and in a ſpiritual ſenſe. Now it is
not needful for me to ſpeak any thing concerning this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe:
for the Scripture it ſelf is ſo clear, that he that runs
may read it. The Scriptures to prove, are theſe: <hi>Iſai. 51. 1, 2.
Iſa.</hi> 43. from verſ. 4. to the 12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 35. thorowout; <hi>Iſa. 51. 3.
Iſa. 48. 20. Hoſ.</hi> 2. from verſ. 14. to the end; <hi>Rev. 12. Ezek.
34. Iſai.</hi> 34. from verſ. 20. to the end.</p>
            <p>Now I had thought to cloſe up this Diſcourſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the wilderneſſe-condition which we do expect God
will gather his Church into, when he ſhall ſeparate them from
Babylon, which is to be underſtood as well literally as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
But ſeeing it is ſo incredible a thing to the Saints, I
conceive they will have but little minde to compare the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
which ſpeak of ſuch a condition. And therefore, ſince
it is the will of God to call me forth to make it forth more
clearly, I do here gladly follow him.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, you may take notice of three particular
eſtates which ſhall befal the Saints in this life, which may very
well be rendered as a wilderneſſe-condition; two of which
are to be accompliſhed in ſpiritual Babylon, as Babylon may
be rendered a State and a National Church; both which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
concerning this wilderneſſe, are to be underſtood in a
ſpiritual ſenſe. Now the Scripture to prove, is <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 3.
where God doth denounce his judgements againſt his people,
in caſe they do not put away their adulteries from between
their breſt; and becauſe they do not, the judgement follows,
which is, to be ſtript naked, and ſit as in the day wherein ſhe
was born, in being made as a wilderneſſe, and ſet as a dry land,
and ſlain with Chriſt; and ſo it goes on to verſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>4. Now in
this Scripture the condition of the Church of God is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
ſet forth, in reſpect of us who have committed ſpiritual
adultery, as it is here ſpoken of at large. And ſo the firſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
condition is accompliſhed in the laſt and dreadful
deſertion of the Church, immediately before her great and
glorious deliverance out of myſtical Babylon, which deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is as well temporal as ſpiritual, even from the bondage
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98336:21"/>
of the creature, as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. 4. and 10. 27. and then follows
the wilderneſſe-condition, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. from verſ. 14. to the end.
We may ſee the like in <hi>Iſa. 32. Jer.</hi> 30 and 31 Chap. I pray
compare theſe Scriptures, which ſpeak of the wilderneſſe-condition
that doth befal the Saints in this ſpiritual deſertion,
when God hath bereft them of all.</p>
            <p>Now there is another wilderneſſe-condition in reference
to the Saints whilſt they are in Babylon, which is of another
nature, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12, where there is mention made of the
womans fleeing into the wilderneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: before ſhe hath wings gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her, as is ſpoken in verſ. 14. to flee into the wilderneſſe in
reſpect of a local ſeparation; which hath been the condition
of the Saints ever ſince the defection from the Faith, for the
ſpace of one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days: but
now it is accompliſhed in the condition of the Saints which
have brought forth a man-childe; which man-childe is caught
up to heaven, unto God and to his throne; which ſhews that
the ſpiritual man in thoſe who are enlightned with that light
of God, in whoſe light we ſee light; I ſay, the ſpiritual man
in ſuch a one lives in God, though as we are in the fleſh, we are
in Babylon, amongſt our hateful enemies: And ſo our being
in God in this ſenſe, may be underſtood to be that wilderneſſe
into which the woman flees immediately after ſhe hath
brought forth a man-childe, where ſhe is kept in reſpect of
her ſpiritual ſubſiſtence. And this we may likewiſe obſerve;
ſhe is fled into this wilderneſſe before ſhe is perſecuted by the
dragon, and ſo hath wings given her to flee away. And ſo I
ſee that this wilderneſſe in a ſpiritual ſenſe may be ſaid to be
God himſelf, as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33. when the Spirit ſhall be poured
down from on high, even that wilderneſſe ſpoken of in <hi>Hoſ.</hi>
2. which we were made in our ſpiritual deſertion, ſhall be a
fruitful field, and the fruitful field a foreſt.</p>
            <p>Now having ſpoken of the wilderneſſe in the ſpiritual
deſertion, and after the reſurrection into which the woman
flees; now the main buſineſſe is to prove that the Lord will
gather his people into a wilderneſſe, as a wilderneſſe is to be
underſtood in the letter, when the Lord ſhall gather away his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98336:21"/>
Saints in reſpect of a local ſeparation from Babylon. Now
the Scriptures to prove this, are as followeth: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout;
<hi>Iſa. 48. 20, 21. Iſa.</hi> 51. at the beginning; <hi>Jer. 31.
1, 2. Ezek.</hi> 34. 25. you may take notice of the whole Chapter;
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. from verſ. 14. to the end; <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 14. I pray
compare theſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And ſo with this I ſhall cloſe up, nothing doubting but
that the Lord will in his good time reveal unto his people
thoſe things which have been hidden from the beginning of
the world, whilſt that others ſhall promiſe to themſelves peace
and ſafety, when ſudden deſtruction ſhall come upon them, as
travel upon a woman with childe; but the Saints ſhall fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
the evil, and have an eſcape.</p>

Concerning the Reſurrection
of the dead.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is the will of God to call me forth to heark what he
ſhall ſay, and ſo accordingly to communicate it in the
ſame giving forth of the Spirit, in that here I muſt make
it known to you, before I can conceive it in my ſelf. Now
the main thing that God will ſpeak by me at preſent, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the condition of mankinde after natural death, and
ſo likewiſe of the Reſurrection of the body: and in this God
doth condeſcend unto my weakneſſe, in that ſome few hours
ſince I did retain ſad thoughts concerning the ſtate of the
Saints departed, with thoſe who ſhall, before the glorious
manifeſtation of Jeſus Chriſt in the fleſh, and ſo likewiſe of
the redemption of the body; which redemption ſhall be as
well temporal as ſpiritual. Now the faithful who are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this life already, with thoſe who ſhall before this glorious
manifeſtation, it doth not appear that they do partake of that
glory which they do who ſhall live unto that time, and if that
we do not expect the reſurrection of the body after the natural
death.</p>
            <p>Unto this I anſwer; Though we do not expect ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
as formerly, yet we do expect a reſurrection of the
body myſtical: for when ſome of the people of God (as in
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) might object, according to their conceiving, as the
Apoſtle ſpeaks in that place, <hi>Some may ſay, How are the dead
raiſed, and with what bodies come they forth? Thou fool</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98336:22"/>
he) <hi>that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die,</hi> as in verſ.
35. <hi>and that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not the body which
ſhall be, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or ſome other grain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
but God giveth a body as it pleaſeth him:</hi> and ſo he goes on to
verſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 42. <hi>ſo alſo is the reſurrection of the dead: it is ſown in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and it is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſown in diſhonour,
and raiſed in glory; it is ſown in weakneſſe, and raiſed in power;
it is ſown a natural body, and raiſed a ſpiritual body. There is a
natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body; as it is written, The
firſt man Adam was made a living ſoul, and the ſecond Adam
was made a quickning ſpirit.</hi> And ſo it follows unto verſ. 47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where it is ſaid, <hi>As we have born the image of the earthly, ſo
we ſhould bear the image of the heavenly:</hi> that is, as we now
bear the image of the earthly, that is, the image of Chriſt in
the fleſh; ſo we ſhall bear the image of the heavenly, Chriſt,
who is ſaid to be a quickning ſpirit: and here we are raiſed a
ſpiritual body; for the body is Chriſt; and ſo the ſpiritual
bodies of the Saints are not diſtinct one from another, but
they make up the fulneſſe of God, and ſo this full God ſhall be
manifeſted in the fleſh of thoſe Saints who ſhall live to the
ſtate of perfection: and ſo the reſurrection of this corporal
body, or <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> as well in a ſpiritual ſenſe as literal,
<hi>cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither can corruption inherit
incorruption:</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Behold, I ſhew you a
myſtery; we ſhall not all die, but we ſhall all be changed, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump:</hi> and in <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
it is called <hi>the great trump</hi> that ſhall ſound, and then the dead
in Chriſt riſe; concerning which I have ſpoken in another
place. So you ſee that theſe Scriptures do not concern the
reſurrection of the body after death, which death cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be ſaid to be death, in that the body is called a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
now a Tabernacle cannot be ſaid to die, onely it is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When this earthly tabernacle ſhall be
diſſolved, we have a houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the
heavens.</hi> And ſo natural death may be looked on as when a
man puts off his clothes when he goes to reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
could deſire not to be unclothed, that is, to put off this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98336:23"/>
body, but rather to live unto that time when the Saints
ſhall be clothed upon, and mortality ſwallowed up of life.
And ſo likewiſe the Scripture ſpeaking of Chriſt, calls his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh
a <hi>vail,</hi> ſaying, <hi>the vail, which was his fleſh:</hi> And ſo the natural
body is onely a vail; and when this vail, which is the fleſh, is
put off, then man may be ſaid to die, and then this vail, which
is the body, returns to the earth, <hi>and the ſpirit returns to God
that gave it.</hi> Now this ſhews that the reaſonable ſoul which
is in all mankinde, is God himſelf, who is in a wicked man as
well as in the Saints; as the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
comprehends them amongſt the off-ſpring of God, <hi>Acts</hi>
17. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29. when he ſaith, <hi>Foraſmuch then as we are the off-ſpring
of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto
gold or ſilver.</hi> Now though God may be ſaid to be in a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man, Chriſt is not in any but thoſe that are Chriſt's, thoſe
who are the ſons and daughters of God Almighty, in whom
God is manifeſted in the fleſh: however, the Saints ſtand in
the ſame relation to God their Father before the time of this
glorious manifeſtation, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are the ſons of
God, but it doth not appear what we ſhall be: but when he ſhall
appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> and
when <hi>to us a childe is born, to us a ſon is given, the government
ſhall be upon his ſhoulder:</hi> and in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. that manchilde
which is brought forth, as he is <hi>caught up to God and to his
throne;</hi> ſo likewiſe he is to <hi>rule all nations with a rod of iron.</hi>
Now this Son in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. and this Man-childe in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and
he that ſits on the white horſe in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 11. who is called
<hi>Faithful and True;</hi> I ſay, that which is ſpoken of in theſe
Scriptures concerning Chriſt, it is to be applied to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Saint, who are comprehended in the number of thoſe
that overcome, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 20. where it is ſaid, <hi>He that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power
over the nations, and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron; as the
veſſels of a potter ſhall they be broken to pieces, even as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of my Father; and I will give unto him the bright morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Star.</hi>
So likewiſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. which ſpeaks of that power
which is given to the Saints, which is confined unto thoſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98336:23"/>
which ſhall overcome, which ſhall ſit down with Chriſt in
his throne, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 21. where it is ſaid, <hi>To him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh,
will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo
overcame, and am ſet down with my Father on his throne.</hi> Now
when it is thus with the Saints, Chriſt ceaſeth to be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
in that the Saints are inveſted into the kingdom, and ſo
declared mightily to be the ſons of God, by the reſurrection
from the dead, and ſo have overcome hell and death, being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
with Chriſt, as in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 2, 3. and 13. 14. <hi>I will ranſome
them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death.
O death, I will be thy plague; O grave, I will be thy deſtruction.</hi>
Now this ranſome is an overcoming, in that it is ſaid in the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> that the Saints did overcome <hi>by the word of God
and the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> which is done in the glorious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation
of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo we are in a capacity to keep
the works of God unto the end. Now this may be underſtood
divers ways, concerning which I cannot ſpeak at preſent:
But when the Saints ſhall thus overcome, they ſhall ſit down
with Chriſt in his throne, even as he overcame, and ſate down
in his Fathers throne. Now this Kingdom of Chriſt is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the former, which was the Kingdom of Chriſt in
the fleſh, a Kingdom of Forms, a power over us; but this
Kingdom throws down all forms and power over us, and all
powers that were over us alſo in reſpect of the Ordinances,
which vaniſh away when this Kingdom doth begin: and ſo
likewiſe this Kingdom ſhall throw down all powers on earth,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 2, 44. ſpeaking there of the laſt powers, it is ſaid, <hi>In the
days of theſe Kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a Kingdom
which ſhall never be deſtroyed; and the Kingdom ſhall not be left
to another people, but it ſhall break in pieces and conſume all theſe
Kingdoms, and ſtand for ever. Dan.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27, it is ſaid, <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and dominion, and the greatneſſe of the kingdom under the
whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt
High, whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions
ſhall ſerve and obey him;</hi> which is the fulneſſe of God, which
comprehends all the Saints departed, which ſhall be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh, which is that reſurrection ſpoken of as before.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98336:24"/>
Now this Kingdom which I have formerly ſpoken of, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in Babylon.</p>
            <p>Now here I have made a digreſſion from the matter in
hand, in that I muſt follow God: but now I am returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and ſo accordingly I ſhall ſpeak further concerning theſe
particulars, according as God ſhall give in, which is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtate of the body after natural death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now we all know,</hi> as the tree falls, ſo it lieth, <hi>and never
riſeth again as to live: and that ſeed which is ſown, it dieth,
and ceaſeth to be as it was; that ſame body never appeareth.
And ſo when man dieth, his</hi> body returneth unto the earth, <hi>as in</hi>
Eccleſiaſtes, <hi>and</hi> Gen. 3. 19, <hi>where it is ſaid,</hi> In the ſweat of thy
brows theu ſhalt eat bread, until thou return to the earth; for out
of it waſt thou taken: for duſt thou art, and to duſt ſhalt thou
return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto this ſome may object,</hi> The creature is ranſomed from
eternal death, by the redemption that was in Chriſt, in reſpect of
the bodies remaining ever in the grave: for it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15,
that <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</hi>
So from this Scripture we do conclude there ſhall be a reſurrection
of the body.</p>
            <p>Unto this I anſwer, There can no ſuch thing be gathered
from this Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. for whereas it is ſaid, <hi>As
in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi> this death
and reſurrection is to be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and
not to be underſtood of the death and reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
for natural death cannot be ſaid ſimply to be death; and
ſo the reſurrection of the natural body cannot be ſaid to be
life; for if it were ſo, the bodies of the wicked may be ſaid
to riſe to life, as well as the Saints: But death eternal is death,
and life eternal is life: to be caſt into outer darkneſſe, where
there is <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> and to be caſt out of the
favour of God, this is death; and to live in God, who is love,
and nothing but love, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God in love,</hi> and he
that loves in live, liveth in God and God in him, this is life
eternal, to know this God, and his Son, whom he hath raiſed
from the dead; not onely to know that God hath raiſed Chriſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98336:24"/>
from the dead, but he hath raiſed me with Chriſt, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
death in me, which is the laſt enemy: in that we are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
with Chriſt, death and hell are deſtroyed in the ſpiritual
man, and caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, which is the
<hi>ſecond death:</hi> now this <hi>ſecond death</hi> belongs to none but the
wicked, the Saints being altogether freed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now it may be demanded</hi> what this lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
is, and ſo conſequently what is the ſecond death from which
the Saints are free.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unto this I anſwer; The</hi> ſecond death <hi>is onely that horrour
of Confuſion which ſhall be in wicked men in the day of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
concerning which the Saints have ſome experience in
the laſt and dreadful deſertion, as in</hi> Hoſ. 13. 13, 14. <hi>from
whence they are ranſomed; and ſo in</hi> Dan. 12. 1. Jer. 30. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at verſ.</hi> 5. For thus ſaith the Lord, We have heard a noiſe
of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. Ask ye now and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man doth travel with childe. Wherefore do I ſee every man
with his hands on his loins as a woman in travel, and all faces are
turned into paleneſſe. Alas, for the day is great, and there is none
like it: it is even the time of Jacobs trouble; but he ſhall be ſaved
out of it. <hi>And ſo it follows in verſ. 8. which ſheweth the
full redemption of the Saints, as well in bodies temporal as
ſpiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now death in a ſpiritual ſenſe, is death; as to be caſt out of
the favour of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this was the death that God did
denounce to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the day that he did eat the forbidden
fruit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Now this death is not the natural death of the
body; for that cannot be ſaid to be death, as before it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
but death in this ſenſe as here, from the which death man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
is ranſomed, in that redemption that was in Chriſt: for
now there is no hatred in God; for <hi>God is love;</hi> nay, he is
love to his enemies, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Love your enemies,
that ye may be like your heavenly Father:</hi> and God ſaith, <hi>Anger
is not in me,</hi> as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> for, ſhould God be angry, the creature
would be as ſtubble before conſuming fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then it may be objected,</hi> If God be love to all, why are
not all ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:98336:25"/>
               <hi>I anſwer, Becauſe God doth not manifeſt himſelf in his
own nature unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any but thoſe who are ordained to life, as in</hi>
Acts 2. As many as were ordained to life, believed. <hi>So</hi> Judas
<hi>ſaid,</hi> Why doſt thou manifeſt thy ſelf to us, aad not unto the world?
<hi>And our Saviour ſaid,</hi> To you it is given to know the myſteries
of the kingdom of heaven; but to them in parables, that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
might not ſee, and hearing might not conceive. <hi>And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith, that</hi> Iſrael hath not attained what he ſought for; but
the election hath attained it, and the reſt were hardened. <hi>And
ſo where God doth not manifeſt himſelf in the face of Jeſus
in the anointing, ſuch a one continues in unbelief, and ſo</hi> dead
in treſpaſſes and ſins: and ſuch were ſome of you, <hi>as the Apoſtle
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ith, until we were waſhed and made clean by this anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And ſo thoſe in whom this anointing, this Spirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
is, in whom Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, ſuch a one</hi>
need not that any ſhould teach him; <hi>for, as the Apoſtle ſaith, the
anointing teacheth him. And ſo as we are taught of God, ſo
are we like wiſe freed from the bondage of the Law, and all
Forms, nay Goſpel-forms, as in</hi> Iſai. 10. 27. <hi>where it is ſaid,</hi>
It ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that his burden ſhall be taken off
thy ſhoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck; and the yoke ſhall be
deſtroyed becauſe of the anointing. <hi>And</hi> Iſai. 9. <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> Thou
haſt broken the yoke of the burden, the ſtaff of the ſhoulder, and
the rod of the oppreſſour, as in the days of Midian: for every
battel of the warriour is of confuſed noiſe, and with tumbling gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in blood; but this ſhall be with burning, and with fuel of
fire: <hi>and the reaſon is given,</hi> For to us a Childe is born, to us
a Son is given; the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder, <hi>as verſ.
6, 17. and then we are freed from all ſervitude, as well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
as ſpiritual; for there ſhall be no</hi> grieving brier <hi>nor</hi>
pricking thorn; <hi>the whole creation ſhall be ſubject to the
Saints, and</hi> they ſhall rule over their oppreſſours: Iſai. 65. 15.
Behold, my ſervants ſhall ſing for joy of heart, but you ſhall howl
for vexation of ſpirit; and ye ſhall leave your Name for a curſe to
my choſen. <hi>And it follows, verſ.</hi> 7. Behold, I create new heavens
and a new earth; the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
minde: but be you glad and rejoyce for ever in that I create:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98336:25"/>
for behold, I create Jeruſalem a rejoycing, and her people a joy; and
the voice of weeping ſhall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of
crying. <hi>And ſo it follows to verſ. 23. where it is ſaid,</hi> They
ſhall not labour in vain, nor bring forth in trouble: <hi>and in verſ.</hi>
25. The wolf and the lamb ſhall feed together; <hi>which ſhews
the glory of the Saints in this life, and their freedom from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.
When it is thus, we are no more ſubject to any Law,
but the</hi> law of liberty; <hi>and ſo we are made</hi> kings and prieſts to
God, <hi>to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifice, when the Lord ſhall have
thus purified the</hi> ſons of Levi <hi>by this anointing, that they may
bring an offering to him in righteouſneſſe, as in</hi> Mal. 3. <hi>Here
I have made a digreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if God will put words into my mouth, I ſhall
ſpeak as concerning the reſurrection of the body, and the ſtate
of mankinde after natural death.</p>
            <p>Now in the firſt place, it is clear in Scripture that there is
no reſurrection of the natural body; but that reſurrection ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, is the reſurrection of the body myſtical, which is to
be underſtood in two particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a reſurrection in this life out of a ſpiritual deſertion,
as I have formerly ſpoken of at large.</p>
            <p>Now there is another reſurrection of the myſtical body, in
reſpect of the Saints departed, concerning which Chriſt ſpeaks
to <hi>Martha,</hi> when ſhe did anſwer to our Saviour according as
the people of God do now adays, as they do conceive of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
myſteries: But when our Saviour ſaid unto her, <hi>Thy
brother ſhall riſe again;</hi> ſhe replied, <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at the reſurrection at the laſt day.</hi> But here we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
though our Saviour doth not contradict <hi>Martha</hi> in
plain terms, yet he ſpeaks quite contrary to her conceivings:
for (ſaith he) <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life: whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and whoſoever
liveth and believeth in me, ſhall never die.</hi> So that from this it
is clear, that death natural is not death, and the reſurrection of
the natural body is not life, becauſe we know by experience
that the people of God that live, and believe in Jeſus, do die a
natural death. And ſo this reſurrection ſpoken of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98336:26"/>
is to be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe, as in the firſt
place a reſurrection out of a ſpiritual deſertion, which the
death and reſurrection of Chriſt did typifie, as now that
Chriſt ſuffered as our ſurety, and ſo as a ſinner: and though he
was put to death in the body, yet he did not die as other men,
but onely lay down his body: for it was ſaid of him, that God
would not leave his ſoul in grave, neither ſuffer his body to ſee
corruption: for, <hi>he laid down his life, to take it up again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as Chriſt was ſlain by our ſin, as our ſurety; ſo we
are ſlain by our iniquities in a ſpiritual ſenſe, as it was ſpoken
of <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 13. 1. to the 15.</p>
            <p>And not onely doth the reſurrection of Chriſt typifie the
reſurrection of the Saints out of ſpiritual deſertion, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi>
26. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. but the reſurrection of Chriſt did typifie the
reſurrection of the whole myſtical body after natural death,
as before ſpoken. And likewiſe it is ſaid, when Chriſt comes
in glory, <hi>all the Saints are gathered together from the four windes;</hi>
which ſhews a general reſurrection, as well of thoſe that are
depart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, as thoſe which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall be alive at that time. And in
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. it is ſaid, when the <hi>ancient of days</hi> did ſit, <hi>thouſands and
thouſands ſtood before him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand
did miniſter unto him.</hi> Now, as I have formerly ſaid, this is
not to be underſtood of the natural body, but the reſurrection
of the myſtical body compleat in one.</p>
            <p>Now having ſpoken of the reſurrection of the Saints after
their natural death; I ſhall now, God aſſiſting, ſpeak concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the ſtate of the wicked, according as God ſhall give it in
to me.</p>
            <p>As the glory and joy of the Saints in heaven is unſpeakable,
concerning which, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath
it at any time entered into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> which
now <hi>is revealed to us by the Spirit,</hi> though it cannot be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the carnal ſenſe, as we are fleſh: ſo on the contrary,
that horrour of conſcience and torment which ſhall be in the
wicked, is likewiſe unſpeakable: For when a wicked man
dies in reſpect of his natural death, that ſpirit of God which
is in a wicked man, returns to God again; and ſo God and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98336:26"/>
wicked man is ſeparated for ever and ever; and ſo God ceaſeth
to be Love as to them, and the creature is given up unto the
devil, to be tormented to all eternity; which torment begins
in the day of judgement and perdition of wicked and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men; and ſo it is clear in Scripture, the wicked are not to
be tormented until that time: for a ſpirit is not capable of
torment, but when it is in the body; and ſo the ſpirit of the
devil that is in a wicked man, ſhall remain unto all eternity.
And as in the <hi>day of judgement and perdition of wicked men,</hi>
there ſhall be a ſeparation between the ſheep and the goats, the
Saints and the Wicked; even ſo likewiſe ſhall Chriſt appear,
<hi>and all his Saints with him,</hi> which make but one incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
God, one Body, which is Chriſt: ſo this incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
God, this Chriſt, the manifeſtation of the Father,
ſhall appear in thoſe living Saints, who ſhall live ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſo this glorious manifeſtation ſhall come in more
and more, until the incomprehenſible God be comprehended
in the Saints. And then when it is thus, <hi>the body ſhall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
upon, and mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of light,</hi> and theſe
very bodies of fleſh ſhall be annihilated and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Now as this glorious manifeſtation of God ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the fleſh of the Saints, which is that reſurrection ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, in that we are raiſed a <hi>ſpiritual body:</hi> ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
all the infernal ſpirits which have acted in the ſpirits of
the children of diſobedience from the beginning of the world,
ſhall be comprehended in one body, which is a ſpiritual body
likewiſe, the ſpirit of the devils: and ſo all theſe infernal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
being comprehended in one, ſhall be manifeſted in the fleſh
of the wicked, when God ſhall ſay, <hi>Go ye curſed into utter
darkneſſe, where there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth
world without end:</hi> For, <hi>the worm ſhall never die, and the fire
ſhall never be quenched.</hi> And ſo it is clear from Scripture,
that all the infernal ſpirits ſhall be tormented in the bodies of
the wicked who ſhall live until the day of Judgement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as I have formerly ſaid, a ſpirit is not capable of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but a ſpirit is capable of joy, concerning which we
have a cloud of witneſſes in the Scriptures, in what God hath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98336:27"/>
revealed to his people. And now to this we ſhall finde that
the devil ſpeaks to Chriſt in thoſe who were poſſeſt, which
came out of the graves, very fierce, who cried out, <hi>What have
we to do with thee, O Jeſus the Son of God? art thou come to
torment us before the time?</hi> And from this Scripture, the
bodies of the wicked, whoſe time of torment ſhall be when
God hath deſtroyed death and hell in his Saints, which is all
darkneſſe, all fear and terrour, all vexation of ſpirit which the
Saints are ſubject to before the glorious manifeſtation: but
when God ſhall appear thus in his Saints, then hell and death
which remain yet in the fleſh after the beginning of this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation,
though the ſpiritual man be deſtroyed, ſhall be
caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond
death: and ſo the Saints may be ſaid to torment the wicked,
as the devil ſpake to Chriſt: which time of judgement is not
yet begun; but when the Lord ſhall give a deliverance unto
all his people, both from the ſpiritual bondage, and out of
the ſpiritual deſertion, then begins this hell to the devil and
his angels, which ſhall be in the bodies of the wicked, as in
<hi>Zech. 14. 12. Iſai.</hi> 66. laſt.</p>
            <p>With this I ſhall cloſe up this Diſcourſe, committing
both you and this unto that God who will bring to light thoſe
things which have been a long time hidden in darkneſſe; nay,
he will make known that which hath been kept ſecret from
the beginning of the world; not onely that which was made
known to the Prophets of old, and the Apoſtles, who ſaw no
further then the letter onely, that which God did reveal unto
them by the Spirit, which was to be accompliſhed in that age:
for they did onely ſee Chriſt in the fleſh, and ſo they did ſee
Chriſt as thorow a vail, and accordingly they did expect more
glorious manifeſtations which ſhould appear to them who
live unto the time of the glorious appearing of the ſecond
coming of Chriſt; which manifeſtation doth now begin to
ſome, in whom the day-S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
