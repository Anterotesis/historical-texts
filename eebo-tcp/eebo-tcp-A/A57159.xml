            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have chosen these words, to open the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the Gospel of Christ, and of the saving knowledge of him thereby, in <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi> whereof the Apostle esteemed all his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104770:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other dignities, priviledges, righteousness, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, upon which he had formerly built the hopes of his salvation, to be all but loss and dung.</p>
            <p>I begin with the former of these, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Evangelical Doctrine, called by the Apostle a <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.11</note> 
               <hi>glorious</hi> Gospel, <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 3 9.</note> a <hi>ministration</hi> of righteousness which exceeds in glory, <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 5.20.</note> a <hi>word of life,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 6.63.</note> a <hi>Gospel</hi> of salvation, <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> the <hi>riches</hi> of the world, <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 11.12.</note> a <hi>treasure</hi> accompanied with the excellency of Divine Power, <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 4.7 1 Tim. 3.16.</note> a great <hi>mystery</hi> of godliness; with other the like elogies, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth those unsearchable riches of Christ therein, as draw forth the wonder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration both of Men and Angels.</p>
            <p>We shall consider the excellency of the Gospel, 1. Comparatively: 2. Absolutely. For the former, I shall not put the <hi>whole world,</hi> nor all the Diadems, Honours, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and Revenues thereof into the balance with Christ; he having assured us that it will little <note n="h" place="margin">Matt. 16.2 Prov. 10.2.</note> profit a man to win them all, and to lose his soul: for though a man could win the whole world, yet within a few years he would lose it again; but the soul being once lost, is lost for ever, never to be recovered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104770:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>But I. we shall compare the Gospel with the <hi>state of Innocency</hi> in Paradise. It cannot be denyed, but that there were divers things in that state of <hi>primitive integrity,</hi> wherein <hi>Adam</hi> excelled any of his sinful off-spring.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Forgive us our trepasses, deliver us from evil.</hi> He had no <hi>war</hi> between the flesh and spirit, no inward <hi>combate</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the law of the members, and the law of the minde; no <hi>temptation of lust</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or draw him away from God: Whereas, the holiest men are now forced to complain, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 7.2.</note> 
               <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi>

               <hi>who shall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> He did <hi>not</hi> in that state stand in <hi>need</hi> of a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of reconciliation</hi> to restore him to the favour of God, wherein he stood right and intire, by the law of his creation. He had <hi>no guilt to</hi> fill him with shame or fear, or to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104770:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drive him away from the presence of the Lord. Yet in some respect the grace of the Gospel is more excellent then the state of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Herein is the manifestation of <hi>more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mercy</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi>: For it was most consonant to the goodness of God, to make reasonable creatures righteous at first; but when they <hi>wilfully fell</hi> from their <hi>created integrity,</hi> it was wonderful and <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3.24 5, 15-17. Eph. 1.6, 7, 2.5, 8.</note> free mercy to restore them again; wonderful and glorious wisdom to do it by so great a condescension and contrivance as the Incarnation and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theSon of God. There lay no bond upon God at all to shew <hi>mercy</hi> to a creature which had cast him off, and rebelled against him.

            <p n="2">2. The Law was exceeding <hi>Burdensome</hi> in many <hi>chargeable</hi> and <hi>painful</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, <hi>a yoke which they were not able to bear,</hi> Act. 15.10. Whereas the <hi>yoke of Christ</hi> is <hi>light and</hi>

unprofitable. And therefore <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> both dyed before the entring of <hi>Israel</hi> into <hi>Canaan</hi>; the Lord thereby signifying, as <note n="a" place="margin">Tertul. <hi>cont. Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> l. 3. c· 16.</note> 
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath observed, the <hi>mortality</hi> of the Law, and its <hi>impotency</hi> to bring men into the possession of the Promises; that it was to <hi>give way to Christ,</hi> who had an <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 7.24.</note> 
               <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Priesthood; and to his Gospel,</hi> which was an <hi>everlasting Gospel,</hi> Rev. 14.6. Thus we see the excellencie of the Gospel above the Law; for <hi>by it onely is ministred Grace</hi> to <hi>pardon</hi> the sins committed against, and to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> the duties required by the Moral Law, and by it is <hi>Christ exhibited to accomplish the Prefigurations</hi> of the ceremonial Law: For <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>To principalities and powers is made known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God,</hi> Eph. 3.10.

            <p>Again, the highest natural knowledge in the world is no way Beatifical. A man may, as to all such learning, be the greatest Scholar living, and yet perish. But the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ by the Gospel will <hi>justifie and save</hi> those that have it. <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justifie many,</hi> Isa 53.11.

But there is <hi>no other name</hi> under heaven, whereby salvation is to be had, but by the Name of Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12.

            <p>Again, let us here consider the <hi>sanctity</hi> of the Gospel, as a great Mystery of <hi>Godliness.</hi> The <hi>whole design</hi> and contrivance thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1. To set forth the <hi>glorious righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104770:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of an holy God,</hi> that neither his verity nor sanctity might be impaired by his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and mercy unto sinners. For though he <hi>spared</hi> them, that he might in them shew the <hi>riches of his Grace,</hi> yet he <hi>spared not his Son,</hi> but delivered him up for us all, that in him he might <hi>declare his righteousness,</hi> Rom. 3.25.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Again, here offereth it self to our view the <hi>admirable contexture of justice and mercy,</hi> the unspeakable contrivance of Redemption and salvation by the Gospel.

               <hi>Iustice and Truth</hi> resolved to punish sin, <hi>Moray and Grace</hi> resolved to save sinners. <hi>No created wisdom</hi> could have found out a way to effect this, <hi>so to sever</hi> the <hi>sin</hi> from the <hi>sinner,</hi> that <hi>Iustice</hi> might satisfie it self upon the one, and <hi>Mercy</hi> magnifie it self upon the other.

            <p n="4">4. Let us consider the <hi>necessity</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, by the Grace and Righteousness whereof alone we are saved through faith in Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>A thing may be <hi>necessary</hi> to an end, 1. By way of a <hi>Temporary mutable sanction.</hi> So <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

obedience</hi> was necessary unto life, by the <hi>first Covenant</hi> made with <hi>Adam, Do this and live,</hi> Rom. 10.5. by which since the fall no man can be saved. 2. By way of a <hi>final per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Decree</hi> never to be altered. Such is the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> in the Gospel, confirmed by an oath to shew the immutability thereof;<note place="margin">Heb. 6.18.</note> for Christ offered <hi>one sacrifice for sin for ever,</hi> upon rejection whereof there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin.<note place="margin">Heb. 10 12.26.</note> If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins, saith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.4.</p>
            <p>Again, one thing may be necessary to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother two ways. 1. <hi>Necessitate causae,</hi> as that which giveth it its being, and <hi>foundeth a right</hi> unto it. So the payment of a <hi>price</hi> is necessary to a <hi>purchase,</hi> and foundeth that right which the Purchaser hath thereunto. 2. <hi>Necessitate viae, without the which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to the possession</hi> of the thing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased. For though the <hi>price procure</hi> me the <hi>property,</hi> yet I must go the <hi>way</hi> which will bring me unto it, before I can be personally possessed of it.</p>
            <p>The only cause of salvation is the <hi>free Grace</hi> of God, and <hi>price</hi> of the bloud of Christ,<note place="margin">Act. 15.11. Eph. 2.5.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving

But we cannot come to the <hi>actual possession</hi> of that inheritance, without running that race of Evangelical holiness, which is the way thereunto.</p>
            <p>From these things thus distinguished, we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>this conclusion,</hi> that although the Gospel were not originally necessary unto blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the Law of Primitive Creation, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant having been made with <hi>Adam</hi> in order unto life; yet upon <hi>supposition</hi> of the <hi>fall</hi> of man, and of the <hi>unchangeable san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of God, whereby the Covenant of Grace is made perpetual, so the Gospel is indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sably necessary unto salvation, called in the Scripture the Gospel of <hi>Salvation,</hi>

               <hi>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory</hi>? Luk. 24.26. for Christ having a double right unto glory; a <hi>natural</hi> right, as the Son of God; and a <hi>purchased</hi> right, as the Saviour of the world; reserveth the former unto himself, and bestoweth the latter upon the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The gracious Acts of Divine Love in <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Adoption</hi> necessary unto the <hi>Ius ad rem,</hi> or deriving a title upon us.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith and Repentance,</hi> which two Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical graces Christ hath honoured in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness

of Salvation above others,<note place="margin">Dan. 9·7, 9. Job 42.6. Ezek. 20.43.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Evangelical obedience</hi> necessary to the <hi>Ius in Re,</hi> to the <hi>Actual possession</hi> of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as the <hi>onely way</hi> which leads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For <hi>without holiness no man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. It is a <hi>gradus</hi> and an inchoation of Glory. Thus we see the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity of the Gospel, wherein we finde Christ meritoriously purchasing, God graciously conveying, Repentance humbly disposing, Faith comfortably receiving, and sincere obedience gradually conducting us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternal salvation.</p>
            <p>In the next place let us observe the <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> of the grace of the Gospel unto the effecting of that blessedness whereunto it is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104770:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so necessary. <hi>In sickness Physick</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi>; but when Death comes, it is <hi>not sufficient</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it. But there is a <hi>Plenipotency</hi> in Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical grace to <hi>consummate</hi> our Salvation for us. <hi>Christ is able to save to the uttermost those that come to God by him,</hi> Heb 7.25. Every thing which he did <hi>corporally for us,</hi> he will do the same <hi>spiritually</hi> by his Grace <hi>in us.</hi> So that though we be yet <hi>imperfect in our selves,</hi> yet we are <hi>complete in him,</hi> Col. 2.10. And as there was a <hi>consummatum est</hi> pronounced upon his work on <hi>earth,</hi> whereby he wrought Redemption for us, <hi>It is finished,</hi> Joh. 19.30. So there will be a <hi>consummatum est</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon his work in <hi>Heaven,</hi> whereby he applyeth Redemption unto us, <hi>It is done,</hi> Rev. 21.6.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> He will <hi>perfect</hi> every good work which he <hi>begins,</hi> and be the <hi>finisher</hi> of what he is the <hi>Author</hi> unto us.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> And this is a further demonstration of the excellencie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, That as it is <hi>an onely,</hi> so it is <hi>an all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> means unto that blessedness which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in tendred unto us.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the excellency of the Gospel will appear, if we consider the infinite <hi>value and pretiousness</hi> of the things therein concerned.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I shall very briefly conclude with but three words of Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To my self and Brethren to whom the dispensation of this glorious Gospel is entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we would be ever mindful of our <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 28.21 Eph. 3.8.</note> Ambassadors must keep strictly to the Mandate of their Princes, and never deviate from their instructions. Our Commission is to teach men to observe all things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Christ hath commanded: <hi>to preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the unsearchable</hi> riches of Christ; to take them off from all presumptuous sins, from all vain delights, from all carnal confidence, from all self-opinion of their own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; to set forth Christ before them, as the <hi>desire of all nations</hi>;<note place="margin">Hag. 2.7.</note> to <hi>convince</hi> them of the All-sufficiency <hi>of his righteousness,</hi> and of the great duties of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> which they owe unto him as King of Saints:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>Not to preach our selves,</hi> our own <hi>fancies, passions,</hi> or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104770:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>interests,</hi> but so to preach Christ Jesus the Lord, as becomes the excellencie of his person and offices, as becomes the Majesty and awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the doctrines of Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To all in place of power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that since Christ to whom all power was given, did, and still doth put it forth for our salvation; they also would be exhorted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert their <hi>power</hi> for the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> of Christ and his Gospel. By the light of their gracious <hi>examples,</hi> to render the beauties of holiness amiable unto others: for the lives of great men are a kinde of law to those that are under them. By their <hi>zeal, courage and justice,</hi> to put to shame the <hi>insolencies</hi> of any who by <hi>profaness</hi> and <hi>atheism</hi> either of tongue, pen, or life, dare offer any scorn or indignity to the Lord, or to the Gospel of Glory. By their <hi>wisdom,</hi> and love to Christ, to use all means for promoting the Gospel of Salvation, and removing out of the way whatsoever doth obstruct the powerful progress and prevalencie thereof amongst men. And here I cannot but with grief of heart once more bewail those <hi>doleful divisions</hi> which <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the beauty, and <hi>shake</hi> the stability of this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104770:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
once flourishing Church. For as in the <hi>natural</hi> body <hi>solutio continui</hi> doth both <hi>pain</hi> &amp; <hi>deform</hi> it; so do <hi>breaches</hi> in the body of Christ <hi>abate</hi> both the <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>comeliness</hi> of it; &amp; while we thus by our <hi>divisions</hi> lessen and weaken one another, we comfort and advantage a common adversary.</p>
            <p>Do not all learned and sober Protestants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the vitals &amp; essentials of true Religion, in the great foundations of faith, worship, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Have they not all one Father, one Head, one Faith, one Hope, one heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> whither they profess to be all going? Why then should brethren fall out by the way? Why is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? I am no Prophet to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell future events. Yet since the <hi>Psalmist</hi> hath told me that where brethren dwell together in <hi>unity,</hi> there the Lord commandeth a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. Since he hath joyned the peace and prosperity of the Church together, <hi>Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces,</hi> Psal. 122. Since the Apostle hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured me, that if we be of one minde, and live in peace, the God of love and peace will be

with us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. I cannot but upon these grounds verily perswade my self, that if we would with a sincere eye, to the glory of God, the interest of the Gospel, and the peace of the Church, (which things ought to be most dear unto us) set our selves with a spirit of meekness and moderation to heal the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and reconcile the differences which are amongst us, that so (if possible) we might be like the Primitive Christians, of <hi>one heart and one soul,</hi> the Lord would say unto us as he did unto his people, when they laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Temple, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.19. <hi>From this day I will bless you.</hi> And if this would not effectually do it, that which I have last to say, I am sure would. Which is,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To perswade all who profess the Gospel to lead their lives agreeable thereunto, <hi>to hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience,</hi> and to express the lineaments ofChrist in their conversation. There is no precept more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcated in the writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles then this, therefore I shall give it you in their words, as having most of aw and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in them. <hi>How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?

let us not let go our <hi>Saviour</hi> to hold fast our <hi>sins,</hi> nor prefer the momentary, sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perishing contents of the world, before the joys of Salvation here, and the enjoyments of it for ever hereafter: let us with fear and trembling consider, that it will be at the last day more tolerable for <hi>Sodom,</hi> then for wicked Christians, whose judgement will be so much the heavier, by how much the more glorious mercies have been revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and despised by them.
