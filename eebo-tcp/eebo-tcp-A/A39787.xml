            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The firſt Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>NO Inclination is ſo honorable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor has any thing bin ſo much
eſteemed in all Nations, and
Ages, as the love of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Society in which every man is
born. And thoſe who have placed their
greateſt ſatisfaction in doing good, have
accounted themſelves happy, or unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
according to the ſucceſs of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to ſerve the intereſt of their
Country. For nothing can be more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
in the minds of men, than a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inclination and duty concurring in the
ſame diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Nature in moſt men prevails over Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
Reaſon in ſome prevails over Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but when theſe two are joined, and
a violent natural inclination finds it ſelf
owned by Reaſon, requir'd by Duty, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61705:4"/>
by the higheſt Praiſes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by the moſt illuſtrious Examples, ſure
that Force muſt be irreſiſtible. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by ſo great a Force, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of my Affairs not allowing me
to be otherwiſe ſerviceable to my Country,
I have in the following Diſcourſe given
my opinion concerning divers matters of
Importance; which probably may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
in the approaching Seſſion of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
I ſhall be very well ſatisfied, if
any thing I ſay do afford a hint that may
be improved by men of better judgment to
the publick Good. I hope I ſhall not be
blamed, for giving my opinion in matters
of publick concernment; ſince 'tis the
right and duty of every man to write or
ſpeak his mind freely in all things that
may come before any Parliament; to the
end that they who repreſent the Nation in
that Aſſembly, may be truly informed of
the ſentiments of thoſe they repreſent.
Beſides, we are now no more under thoſe
tyrannical Reigns in which it was a crime
to ſpeak of publick Affairs, or to ſay that
the King had received bad counſel in any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61705:4"/>
thing. If in this diſcourſe I argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſome things, which perhaps may
not be propoſed in the enſuing Seſſion of
Parliament; they are nevertheleſs ſuch,
as perſons in publick truſt have in their
converſation given juſt cauſe to think
they were deſigned.</p>
            <p>'Tis probable that the Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they proceed to any other buſineſs,
will take into conſideration a tranſaction,
which having paſſed ſince the laſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
may, if it be not aboliſhed, import
not leſs than the infringing the freedom
of this and all ſubſequent Parliaments;
I mean, the farming of the Cuſtoms to
the State of Burroughs.</p>
            <p>Corruption is ſo entirely diſowned by
all men, that I may be allowed to ſay,
when I name it, that I name the blackeſt
of Crimes; and when I name any guilty
of it, I name a very odious Criminal.
But Corruption is more or leſs dangerous
in proportion to the ſtations in which
corrupt men are placed. When a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man receives any advantage to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
a truſt, one, or a few perſons may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61705:5"/>
ſuffer; If a Judg be corrupted, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is extended to greater numbers:
But when Legiſlators are bribed, or
(which is all one) are under any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ingagement, that may influence them
in their Legiſlative capacity, much more
when an intire State of Parliament is
brought under thoſe circumſtances, then
it is that we muſt expect Injuſtice to be
eſtabliſhed by a Law, and all thoſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
which will inevitably follow the
ſubverſion of a Conſtitution, I mean,
ſtanding Armies, oppreſſive Taxes, Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
whilſt the outward form only of the
antient Government remains to give them
Authority. I confeſs I have been often
ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make an end of admiring the folly
and ſtupidity of men living under ſome
modern Governments, who will exclaim
againſt a Judg that takes bribes, and never
reſt till he be puniſhed, or at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;
and yet at the ſame time ſuffer
great numbers of thoſe who have the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
Authority, to receive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
bribes of places and penſions to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61705:5"/>
betray them. But we ſhall have leſs to
ſay for our ſelves, if we ſuffer the Votes
of the whole State of Burroughs to be at
once influenced by the farming of the
Cuſtoms. For in other places the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Bribery has gone no farther
than to attack ſingle perſons; but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
at once to bribe a whole State of
Parliament, is an attempt of which it
ſeems we only are capable.</p>
            <p>Yet to ſhow how far I am from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
any man of the leaſt bad deſign,
without a cauſe, I ſhall ſay, that as I
know this buſineſs of the Farm above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
was firſt moved without any
deſign to influence the Votes of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs
in Parliament; ſo I am willing to
believe that few of thoſe who have ſince
acted in this Affair had any ſuch deſign.
But if any man, after due conſideration
of the evil conſequences which muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and are inſeparable from ſuch a
Farm, ſhall ſtill perſist in endeavouring
to continue it, he cannot but be an Enemy
to the Liberties of his Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61705:6"/>
This is ſo bold an attempt, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
with the freedom of Parliament,
that till it be removed 'tis to be preſumed
they will not proceed to any other buſineſs:
but this obſtruction once taken away, we
may hope they will begin with that Affair
which preſſes moſt, and in which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ſo univerſally concerned, I mean
that of the African and Indian Company.</p>
            <p>I know ſome will exclaim againſt this
method, and propoſe that the buſineſs of
the Army may be firſt taken into conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
as of more general concernment to
the Nation whether it ſtand or be disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They will not fail to ſay, that before
all other things the King's buſineſs (as
their ſtile runs) ought to be done. To
this I anſwer, that he who makes a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
between the buſineſs of the King and
that of the Country, is a true friend to
neither. And if it be conſider'd, that
the Ships of the Company are ſailed; that
Scotland has now a greater venture at Sea
than at any time ſince we have bin a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that the accidents and misfortunes
to which an enterprize of this nature is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61705:6"/>
ſubject, are ſo many and ſo various, either
by the loſs of Ships from the ordinary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of the Sea, or Hurricanes; by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the men, who for the moſt part
are neither accuſtomed to ſuch long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
nor to Climats ſo different from
their own; by the death of one or more of
thoſe to whom the conduct of this Affair
is principally entruſted; by being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of freſh Proviſions when thoſe
they carry with them are ſpent; by being
attack'd at Sea or at Land, before they
have fortified a place for themſelves, or a
thouſand other accidents, (for all things
are extremely difficult to the firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers)
I ſay, if it be conſider'd, that
Proviſions, or the ſmalleſt things neceſſary,
falling ſhort but by a few days, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bin the ruin of the greateſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
and chiefly of thoſe of this kind;
there cannot be any more urgent affair than
that of providing inceſſantly a ſupply for
the neceſſities of ſo many men as are on board
thoſe Ships, who may be brought under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
ſufferings by a delay, whilſt
our ſtanding Forces are living at eaſe.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61705:7"/>
Eſpecially ſince the Nation has ſo great a
Concern in this Enterprize, that I may
well ſay all our hopes of ever being any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than a poor and inconſiderable People
are imbarked with them.</p>
            <p>The reputation and power of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was formerly very conſiderable as
long as Armies were compoſed of thoſe
numerous Militia's of the Barons. Our
Anceſtors have often ſeen 60, 80, or 100
thouſand men under their Enſigns, which
then might well bear the motto, That none
ſhould provoke them unpuniſhed. Since
that time, the face of things is quite chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
throughout all Europe; and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Militia's being altogether decay'd, and
no good ones any where eſtabliſhed, every
Country is obliged to defend it ſelf in time
of war, and maintain its reputation by
the force of Mony; that is, by mercenary
Troops, either of their own, or of other
Countries both by Sea and Land. But
ſuch a vaſt expence, the riches of no
Country is able to ſupport without a great
Trade. In this great alteration our caſe
has been ſingularly bad and unfortunate:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61705:7"/>
for partly through our own fault, and
partly by the removal of our Kings into
another Country, this Nation, of all thoſe
who poſſeſs good Ports, and lie conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
for Trade and Fiſhing, has bin the
only part of Europe which did not apply it
ſelf to Commerce; and poſſeſſing a barren
Country, in leſs than an age we are ſunk
to ſo low a Condition as to be deſpiſed by
all our Neighbours, and made uncapable to
repel an injury, if any ſhould be offered:
ſo that now our motto may be inverted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
all may not only provoke, but ſafely tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon us. To recover from ſuch a
condition, what would not any people do?
What toils would they refuſe? To what ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
would they not expoſe themſelves?
But if the means by which they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
are not only juſt and honorable,
but ſuch as with reſtoring honor and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the Nation, may give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that excellent, tho now ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and almoſt extinguiſhed ſpirit of our
People, and gratify every man in the eaſes
and pleaſures of Life: is it not ſtrange
that there ſhould be found men amongst
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61705:8"/>
us capable to oppoſe thoſe things; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
at a time, when, I may ſay, by no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of any man, but by an unforeſeen
and unexpected change of the genius of
this Nation, all their thoughts and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
as if united and directed by a
higher power, ſeem to be turned upon
Trade, and to conſpire together for its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
which is the only means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
us from our preſent miſerable and
deſpicable condition? For hitherto our
convenient Situation and good Harbours,
our rich Seas and Lakes have bin unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to us; no care has bin taken to ſet
the Poor at work; and multitudes of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
for want of employment by Trade
and Manufactures, go yearly out of the
Kingdom without any intention to return.
In ſuch a ſtate and condition of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it ſeems theſe men find their account
better, than if our Country were filled
with People and Riches, our Firths co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Ships, and they ſhould ſee
every where the marks of what good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Trade are able to produce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61705:8"/>
But I ſhall be told, that I go upon a
miſtake; and that no Scots man is an
Enemy to the African Company: That
thoſe who approach his Majeſty; know moſt
of his mind, and are moſt entruſted by
him in the Government of this Nation,
and ſuch as are influenced by them, would
only have the Parliament to conſider the
ſtreights and difficulties his Majeſty
would be put to, if he ſhould in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner encourage this Trade,
by reaſon, that being King of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
Stat-holder of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, our
intereſt in this point may come to interfere
with that of thoſe Nations. The people
of thoſe Countries ſolicit, each in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their own Companies: Will not
theſe men ſo much as adviſe the King to
diſtribute impartial juſtice, and to let
every one have the proportionable reward
of his induſtry? O but we have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
from Cuſtoms for many years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which neither the Engliſh nor Dutch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
I ſhall not ſay, that when the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Nation ſhall come to a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of their Intereſt, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61705:9"/>
that Riches in Scotland will be
beneficial to England, ſince the Seat of
the Monarchy is there. I need not ſay
that the Engliſh and Dutch are free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and may ſurely procure for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as great advantages as Scotland:
But that Scotland offered to both Nations
a ſhare in that advantage which they had
obtained for themſelves only; and to
England an equal ſhare. I know the
Parliament of England took the thing
warmly at firſt; but when upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
they found that we had not
given them the leaſt juſt ground of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but on the contrary, made them the
faireſt offer we could; it was then let fall,
and has not been mentioned in the laſt
Seſſion. So that what theſe Gentlemen
alledg of his Majeſty's difficulties to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
the Engliſh in this point is falſe,
unleſs by the Engliſh they mean thoſe who
having for many years oppreſſed the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Colonies in America, are afraid that
if any Settlement ſhould be made in that
part of the world by us, under a free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
the Engliſh Planters removing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61705:9"/>
to it, might occaſion a ſtrict inquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Crimes, and their Puniſhment
for them.</p>
            <p>I do not hear that the Dutch have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
any Memorial to his Majeſty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Company, and cannot imagine
in what terms any ſuch Addreſs, either
from them or the Engliſh, can run.
Should it be, that his Majeſty ought not
to protect us in our juſt Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges?
That he ſhould break the Laws,
and violate his Oath by our deſtruction?
Or undermine us as the Court did the
fiſhing Company in K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> C's time, and fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
this ſecond as well as that firſt great
attempt to make the Nation conſiderable?
That there have bin underhand dealings
(tho without his Majeſty's knowledg, as
we ought to believe) the Affair of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough
dos ſufficiently demonſtrate; and
likewiſe that his Majeſty's Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
paid by the Crown of England, are
no more to be looked upon as Miniſters for
the Crown of Scotland. Since we are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Kingdoms, and have ſeparate Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at home, we ought to have ſeparate
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61705:10"/>
Miniſters abroad; eſpecially in an Affair
wherein we may have a ſeparate Intereſt
from England, which muſt always be in
matters of Trade, tho never ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
Neither ought we to have ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Miniſters only upon the account of
Trade, but upon all occaſions, wherein the
Honor or Intereſt of the Nation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
That we have not had them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
ſince we were under one King with
England, was, I ſuppoſe, to ſave char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and becauſe we truſted to the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of ſuch as we judged to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the King of Great Britain:
But now we are undeceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſure the
Nation could never have beſtowed mony
better, than in having a Miniſter at the
late Treaty of Peace, who might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the reeſtabliſhment of the Nation
in the Privileges they had in France, which
was totally neglected: And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great and unproportionable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Sea and Land Soldiers that we
were obliged to furniſh for the ſupport of
the War, yet not one tittle of advantage
was procured to us by the Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61705:10"/>
Now theſe Gentlemen, at the ſame
time, would perſwade us to pay almoſt as
many Forces in time of Peace, as we did
in time of War; and like Pharaoh's Tax-maſters
would have us make Brick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
allowing us Straw. And all, that
theſe Forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Regiments, which
to the conſuming of our people, we recruit
in Holland, in caſe of any rupture abroad
upon the account of the Engliſh or Dutch
trade, may be employed in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>To obviate then part of ſo many ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, 'tis my opinion, That in place
of laying a Land Tax upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for maintaining Forces to defend the
Engliſh and Dutch Trade, we ſhould
raiſe one for the carrying on of our own:
And (ſince the Nation is ſo generally
concern'd in this Indian Trade, that the
ruin of it, which, God forbid, may very
probably draw along with it that of the
whole Trade of the Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
diſcouragement from ever attempting
any thing conſiderable hereafter) that a
twelve-months Ceſs ſhould be levied for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61705:11"/>
the ſupport of it; and that whatſoever
may be the product of that mony, by the
trade of the Company, ſhall go to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Nation from publick Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
whenever they ſhall make a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend
of clear profit. For 'tis but reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that, ſince the Company has bin
unjuſtly hinder'd of that ſupply of mony
which they expected, and might have had
from ſtrangers, they ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
for redreſs to the Parliament, who
if they ſhall think ſit to take ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
the Company will be able imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to procure an advance of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mony
upon the credit of the Ceſs.</p>
            <p>It will be alſo ſit, that the Company
petition the Parliament to addreſs his
Majeſty, that the three ſmall Frigats,
lately built at the expence of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may be appointed for a Convoy to the
next Ships they ſhall ſend out.</p>
            <p>The Parliament having provided for
this preſſing Affair, will (no doubt) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the buſineſs of the Forces, and to
conſider whether a Standing Army ſhall
be kept up in time of Peace, as in time
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61705:11"/>
of War; for the Arguments uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
them for a year, may be improved
to keep them up for ever; eſpecially ſince
we have at this time a ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them, than I hope ſhall ever
be alledged hereafter; I mean that of the
Nation's being exhauſted of Mony by a
three years ſcarcity next to a famine:
But how long this may continue God only
knows.</p>
            <p>A long and tedious War, which has
coſt this Nation much blood, is at length
ended in a Peace. Our expence of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
has bin inconſiderable by reaſon of
our poverty through want of Trade; yet
have we contributed our part, if the
ſmalneſs of our Stock be conſidered. But
in the loſs of our People, which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Blood and Riches too, we have
paid a treble proportion. Seven or eight
thouſand of our Seamen were on board
the Engliſh Fleet, and two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
in that of Holland: We had twenty
Battalions of Foot, and ſix Squadrons of
Dragoons here and in Flanders. Beſides,
I am credibly informed, that every fifth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61705:12"/>
man in the Engliſh Forces was either of
this Nation, or Scots-Iriſh, who are a
people of the ſame blood with us. All
theſe, by a modeſt computation, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to thirty thouſand men. This I
only mention to anſwer the Reproaches of
thoſe who vilify us as an inconſiderable
people, and ſet a mean value on the ſhare
we have born in this War. I am unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſpeak of the returns that have
bin made to us for our aſſistance, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to our Soldiers the Donative given
to thoſe who had ſerved no better than
they, and by preſſing our Seamen, contrary
to the Law of Nations. Now tho reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the laſt of theſe during the War,
would have mark'd us out for diſaffection
and Jacobitiſm; yet we ought to hope it
may be mentioned at this time without
offence. But ſome will ſay, that the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of Peace are ſo great, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Calamities of War, but even Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and Injuries from our Neighbours,
ought to be forgot and drowned in the
joys, which the hopes of Eaſe, Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Plenty muſt needs produce. And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61705:12"/>
indeed I ſhould be contented, that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments
were ſacrificed to ſuch charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hopes, if they had any real foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But we have a Peace, and yet muſt
not reap any benefit by it; a poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is to maintain almoſt as many Forces
as they did in time of War; a Nation
endeavouring to ſet up Manufactures,
and to advance Trade, muſt ſtill ſee their
people conſumed, by continuing on foot
Mercenary Forces.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſist upon the Arguments
that may be brought againſt Standing
Forces, nor go about to ſhow how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistent
they are with Liberty. I ſhall not
mention the Examples of almoſt all the
Nations of Europe, who by keeping up
ſuch Forces in time of Peace are become
Slaves. This has bin fully made out by
divers Treatiſes which have bin lately
publiſhed, and are in the hands of moſt
men. Perhaps alſo it will be ſaid, that I
am not to inſist upon the point of Right
in this Caſe, ſince there is no Article in
our Claim of Right to declare the keeping
up of a Standing Army in time of Peace,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61705:13"/>
without conſent of Parliament, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Law. Yet thoſe who are of that
opinion ſhould conſider, that the Eſtates
of this Kingdom have made the keeping
up of a Standing Army, in time of Peace,
without conſent of Parliament, an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in the Forfaulture of the late King
James. But it ſeems we muſt uſe more
modeſt Arguments than ſuch as naturally
ariſe from the hazard our Liberty may
run, by allowing Standing Forces, or from
any Right we have to pretend that 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Conſtitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to impoſe them upon us, and be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to bring all our reaſons from our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
and inability to maintain any. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
as this is the moſt modeſt, ſo ſurely
'tis the ſtrongeſt Argument; for ſuch
Forces are not to be maintained, without
increaſing the Poverty of this Country,
and reducing it at length to utter deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
'Tis hard if the Charges of a
Government ſhould be the ſame in time
of Peace, or even come near the expence
that was perhaps requiſite to be made in
time of War; ſuch a Nation can never
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61705:13"/>
hope to be in a flouriſhing ſtate. Now
as our condition will not permit us to keep
up theſe Forces, ſo I can ſee no reaſon
why we ſhould do it if we could. There
is no protence for them, except only to
keep a few wretched Highlanders in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
which might be eaſily done by a due
execution of our old Laws made for that
purpoſe, without the help of any Fort or
Gariſon. We are at a great diſtance
from any other Enemy, and cannot juſtly
fear an Invaſion from beyond ſo great a
Sea as muſt be paſſed to come at us. And
tho during the late War we were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
under the apprehenſions of ſuch an
Invaſion, yet the Enemy was not ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
to put it to the hazard.</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, that the late King
James has ſtill many Partizans in this
Nation, that we have always bin, and ſtill
are a divided People, and that there are
many ill men amongst us: They have alſo
the confidence ſtill to tell us of an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upon Scotland by the French King;
who to cover this probable deſign, has
delivered up ſuch vaſt Countries, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61705:14"/>
places of ſuch great importance. Why do
they not alſo ſay, that as a man every day
after he is born, is nearer to his end, ſo
are we every day after the Peace nearer to a
War? The party of the late King James
was always inſignificant, and is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a jeſt. If the Government will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
good men, they will need no
Standing Forces to ſecure themſelves from
the bad. For of what uſe can any Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
be ſuppoſed to be, that is not ſit to
preſerve the quiet of a Country remote
from enemies in time of Peace?</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the Presbyterian perſwaſion
ſhould, I think, be the laſt of all men to
eſtabliſh an Army; for whatever they may
promiſe to themſelves, 'tis certain that
either upon his Majeſty's death, or upon
alterations of meaſures, and changes of
diſpoſitions in the minds of the Members
of future Parliaments, it will be always
a ſure Rod for the backs of thoſe who have
ſo many enemies. But men are blind in
Proſperity, forgetting Adverſity and the
viciſſitudes of human Affairs. And it
were but reaſonable that thoſe of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61705:14"/>
who in the late King James's
reign made ſo falſe a ſtep as was like to
have proved fatal to our Liberties, ſhould
now think of making ſome amends, and
ſhowing that they have profited by their
error, and are not (as they expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
time-ſervers.</p>
            <p>But to diſcover the true reaſon why
Standing Forces are deſigned to be kept up
in this Nation in time of Peace, we need
only look back on the uſe that was made of
them during the late War. For after the
reduction of the Highlands they ſerved
only for a ſeminary to the forces of this
Nation that were with his Majeſty in
Flanders, the beſt of their men being
drawn out yearly for recruiting thoſe
Forces. This alſo proves that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
knew very well, that there was no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
from the Invaſions I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
For if there had bin any real danger
of that kind, he would not have weakned
the Forces in this Kingdom ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.
I am very far from diſapproving
his Majeſty's Conduct in that Affair; I
do on the contrary highly commend his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61705:15"/>
Wiſdom in it, and think it to have bin
the beſt uſe that could be made of Forces
in this Country, whilſt the War continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But muſt we in time of Peace be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beyond meaſure to maintain Forces,
which upon occaſion are to ſerve for the
defence of two of the richeſt Nations in
the world; Nations that have manifeſted
their unwillingneſs to let us into the leaſt
copartnerſhip with them in Trade, from
which all our Riches, if over we have any,
muſt ariſe? This is to load a poor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Taxes, and to oppreſs them with
Soldiers in order to procure Plenty and
Riches to other Countries, of which they
are not to have the leaſt ſhare. Rich
and opulent Nations are to enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of the Peace, and we are to ſuffer,
that they may enjoy them with ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Therefore I am of opinion, that ſince
we can expect no advantages from our
Neighbours or Allies, we do our ſelves
right, by refuſing to maintain any Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forces for their behoof, becauſe we
need none for our own defence, and that
our Militia may be ſufficient on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61705:15"/>
where force is neceſſary. Eighty four
thouſand pounds, which is the Sum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for the yearly maintenance of Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forces, is as much mony to us, as two
Millions five hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds is to England, ſince we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to above the thirtieth part of
their Wealth. And yet that Nation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
but three hundred and fifty thouſand
pounds for the forces they keep on foot;
of which ſum 12000 pounds is more
than the thirtieth part. If it be ſaid
that England allows more for their Fleet
than for their Land Forces; I anſwer,
it ought to be conſidered that England
with all its Riches maintains only five
Millions and half of People, and that
Scotland upon a thirtieth part maintains
a million and half. Eighty four thouſand
pounds laid out yearly in Husbandry, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures
and Trade, may do great things
in Scotland, and not only maintain (tho
in a different way of living) all thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Soldiers, of which theſe Forces
are deſigned to conſiſt, but alſo vaſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
this Nation; whereas great numbers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61705:16"/>
of Soldiers produce nothing but beggery
in any place. People employed in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
Husbandry and Trade, make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
as well as Soldiers, and their
labour and induſtry is an overplus of
Wealth to the Nation, whilſt Soldiers
conſume twice as much as they pay for, and
live idle.</p>
            <p>'Tis not the leaſt misfortune of this
Country, that the younger Sons of the
Nobility and Gentry, have in all times
had their inclinations debauched to an
idle, for the moſt part criminal, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
always unprofitable ſort of Life; I
mean that of a Soldier of Fortune. Their
Talents might have bin much better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in Trade and Husbandry to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of their Country, and increaſe
of their Patrimony. Let us begin to
come off from ſuch ruinous ways of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and if we deſign to carry on a great
Trade, let us employ men capable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it. From all theſe Conſiderations I
ſay, That the keeping up of any Standing
Forces in time of Peace is not only uſeleſs,
but deſtructive to the well being of this
Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61705:16"/>
If it be objected, that this would take
away even the ordinary Guards; I anſwer,
that whilſt we had a King reſiding in
Scotland, he had no other Guard than
forty Gentlemen; and now when we have
no King amongst us, we muſt have a
ſquadron of Horſe and two battalions of
Foot, with the title of Guards. But I
would know what Guards they are we muſt
keep up. Are they thoſe who yielded up the
rank of the Nation and dignity of a
Crown, if it have any preheminence above
a Commonwealth? I am far from plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for mutiny againſt a General, or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to a King; but when the meaneſt
Officer thinks himſelf injured in his Rank,
he demands his Paſs, and will ſerve no more;
neither is he blamed by any Prince for
ſo doing. If the Officers of that body
would have done as much for the honour
of their Country, ſure they would have
merited his Majeſty's eſteem, and deſerved
rewards from the Nation. But how they
can pretend to be kept up after an action
that our Anceſtors would have thought
to deſerve not only breaking, but a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61705:17"/>
to precede it, I cannot imagine.
I know there are many brave Gentlemen
among them who were much grieved at the
thing, but they had a bad example from
the then commanding Officer; and 'tis to
be feared that his advancement to the
place of the greateſt military Truſt and
Importance in the Kingdom, may by his
Majeſty's enemies be imputed to that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But after all we are told, that if we will
keep up Standing Forces we ſhall have an
act of Habeas Corpus. This would be a
wiſe bargain: here is a price for our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
ſure we may expect an immenſe
Sum, and a ſecurity without exception.
No, no, but you ſhall have an Act of
Parliament for the freedom of your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
tho there be never ſo many Standing
Forces in the Kingdom; that is, we ſhall
have the Law on our ſide, and another
ſhall have the force, and then let nature
work. If there be no danger that Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forces ſhould violate the Law, there
is no danger from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61705:17"/>
There is no pretence to ſpeak of a Ceſs
or Land-Tax for maintaining Forces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the buſineſs of the Army be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
conſideration; and one would think, if
the Army be disbanded, it ſhould not be
mentioned at all. Yet 'tis certain that
ſuch men as would recommend themſelves
by a pretended Loyalty, will not fail to
tell us, that we ought to be at the leaſt as
liberal to his preſent Majeſty, who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us from Popery and Slavery, as
we were to King James, who would have
brought us under both: and tho they now
pretend that a Ceſs for Life will not be ſo
much as mention'd in the approaching Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
we know very well their conduct in
that Affair will be regulated upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
they ſind in the Parliament to
grant or refuſe it; and that if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any hopes of obtaining ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Jewel to the Crown, they will be
ſure to bring in that Affair when leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>The giving his Majeſty a Land-Tax
during Life, and ſo great a one as that
granted to the late King James, with the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61705:18"/>
Revenue already ſettled on him for the
ſame term, makes it impoſſible for the
Subject to give more, and conſequently is
of all thoſe Affairs that can come before
any Parliament the greateſt, and of the
higheſt importance; ſince it tends to the
making Parliaments leſs neceſſary, and
conſequently to the aboliſhing them, with
the antient conſtitution of Government in
this Nation.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have the honour to adviſe
his preſent Majeſty, if they be true lovers
of the Monarchy, ought to have a care of
treading in the former footſteps, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all ſhun to adviſe him to deſire thoſe
things of the Parliament which King
James deſired and obtained. It were their
duty by all means, to endeavour a fair
underſtanding and a continual good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
between King and People,
which certainly is the only true ſupport of
Monarchy. Now there are no occaſions
of entertaining and increaſing that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and thoſe mutual good Offices that
ſhould, like regular Tides, ebb and flow
between King and People, greater than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61705:18"/>
thoſe of Parliaments. Endeavours to
take away the frequency of Parliaments,
are endeavours to take away thoſe frequent
good Offices between King and People.
The King ſtands in need of Mony, the
People of good Laws, which their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
and his great Council offer to
him, that they may have his ſanction,
and that he may provide for their due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
Mony may be given at once,
for a long time, or for ever; but good
Laws cannot be ſo enacted, the occaſion
and neceſſity of them diſcovering it ſelf
only from time to time: And if the one
go without the other, the mutual good
Offices, and conſequently the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
between King and People ceaſes.</p>
            <p>It may be farther conſidered, that the
King has the power of calling Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that by giving him for Life
all that we can give, we ſhall make Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
unneceſſary to him. If any man
ſuggeſt that it is a crime to ſuſpect that ſo
good and juſt a Prince as his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is, will not always do what is for the
good of his People; I anſwer, that I have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61705:19"/>
all the deference, reſpect and eſteem for his
Majeſty that any Subject ought to have;
but it were a fulſome piece of flattery for
any man to ſay, that he cannot be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
by bad Counſel, or that he is not
ſubject to thoſe frailties of miſtake and
prejudice, from which no mortal was ever
free, and Princes always moſt ſubject to
through the ſuggeſtions and bad Offices of
men about them.</p>
            <p>But let us ſuppoſe that his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will never make the leaſt bad uſe of
this Tax, who ſhall ſecure as his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
will not? If it be ſaid that 'tis only
for his preſent Majeſty this Tax is deſired,
and that it is in the power of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to refuſe it to the Succeſſor; I ſay,
with what probability will it, and with
what face can it be refuſed to him? Theſe
men deſire it for his preſent Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
King James had it, tho he made
bad uſe of it; the Succeſſor ſhall deſire
it becauſe his preſent Majeſty had it, and
made good uſe of it; I think his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſtronger. So that tho this be
ſaid to be only for the Life of his preſent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61705:19"/>
Majeſty, yet upon the matter it is for
ever. And then I need not tell you the
conſequence, our Parliaments ſhall be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
our Kings ſhall become Tyrants,
and we of Subjects, ſlaves.</p>
            <p>But if we look more nearly into this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
I doubt not it will appear very groſs.
During the late War, Land Taxes were
only demanded from year to year, and we
gave them chearfully, in hopes that a few
years would put an end to that charge.
When we had undoubted reaſons to believe
there would be a Peace, they were demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be given for two years; and now
God has bleſſed us with it, if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
during his Majeſty's Life, will
not this look as if we were to have a Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Army during the ſame time?</p>
            <p>A Land Tax during his Majeſty's
Life, is a French Taille for that time.
And we ought not to forget that we are
beginning, to the great advantage of the
Nation, to make ſome ſmall progreſs in
Trade; but if it be not incouraged, and
much more if it be nipt in the bud, there is
an end of all our hopes. One of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61705:20"/>
things in Trade, is to incourage Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation;
and 'tis known that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Commodity of this Kingdom is Corn:
if there be a Land Tax on thoſe whoſe
chief riches conſiſt in Corn, they cannot
ſell it ſo cheap to the Merchant, that he
can make any profit by exporting it.</p>
            <p>As for the Arguments of thoſe who
are for this Tax, I need anſwer none of
them; they are, To ſave the trouble and
expence of frequent Parliaments; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Nation did truſt King James
with this Tax, who made bad uſe of it,
(a modeſt and a ſenſible Argument!) Are
they not afraid it ſhould be ſaid, that
thoſe who adviſe the King to ask the ſame
truſt King James had, may adviſe him
likewiſe to the ſame things, for which
King James demanded it? Sure I am,
that many who plead for this now, are the
ſame Perſons who did the like for King
James: and as for the expence occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by frequent Parliaments, I believe
there is neither Shire nor Borough but
will find Perſons very willing to repreſent
them, without putting them to any charge.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61705:20"/>
I know 'tis commonly ſaid in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that Parliaments do more hurt than
good; but it is becauſe they are never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unleſs to impoſe mony: will it mend
the matter to lay on at once, and for Life,
as much as the Nation is able to pay?
We were getting ſome good Laws for our
Mony, but then we ſhall be excluded from
that benefit.</p>
            <p>In a word, our Forefathers had two
ſecurities for their Liberties and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
they had both the Sword and the
Purſe: The Sword antiently was in the
hand of the Subject, becauſe the Armies
then were compoſed of the Vaſſals who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on the Barons. That Security is
gone; ſhall we throw the other after it,
and thereby I may very well ſay, diſſolve
the Conſtitution, and the Monarchy?
For a Government is not only a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
when tyrannically exerciſed; but alſo
when there is no ſufficient caution in the
Conſtitution that it may not be exerciſed
tyrannically.</p>
            <p>When the Parliament has put an end
to the Affairs beforementioned, it were to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61705:21"/>
be wiſhed that this being the firſt Seſſion
ſince the concluſion of the Peace, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo long a War, they would paſs ſome
Act to eaſe the minds, and take away
the fears and apprehenſions of many men
who are ſtill obnoxious to the Law, of
whom the greater part are abroad; and
all of them both at home and abroad, for
want of an Act of Indemnity, made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate,
and only ſitted to involve others
in the ſame uneaſy and diſtracting Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
under which they themſelves
live. But Acts of Indemnity are the
worſt and moſt pernicious of all Laws to
the well being of any Government, unleſs
the moſt notorious offenders be firſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and in ſuch caſes only incouragements
to new Tranſgreſſions, deſtroying the real
ſecurity of all Government, and effect of
all Laws, by giving an intire impunity to
the attempts againſt both. So that there
ſeems to be an abſolute neceſſity, both of
making an example of the notorious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Liberties of this Country, and
giving a general Pardon to the reſt; if
we will either ſecure the Government for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61705:21"/>
the future from endeavours to introduce
Arbitrary Power, cut up the Party of the
late King James by the roots; or quiet
the minds of the people, and remove the
animoſities that may remain in a Nation
wherein two or more parties have bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
againſt each other, to the ruin of
the publick Liberty; and extinguiſh the
memory of thoſe Factions for ever.</p>
            <p>When 'tis confeſs'd and acknowledged,
that there have bin bold attempts and
treacherous practiſes to deſtroy the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
overturn the Conſtitution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and ſuppreſs the Liberty of a
Nation, and yet no example made of the
Adviſers, and thoſe who have bin emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
ſubſervient to ſuch deſigns; ſuch
a People has as much laid the Foundation
of their own ruin, as if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that thoſe who ſhall hereafter ingage
themſelves in the like attempts, need fear
no puniſhment. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon a Revolution fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a War, circumſtances of Affairs
may be ſuch, that till the War be at an
end, 'tis not ſit to puniſh great Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
But there was no reaſon, nor any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61705:22"/>
well-grounded political conſideration, why
immediatly upon the late Revolution, the
moſt notorious of thoſe Offenders ſhould
not have bin puniſhed; by which means
we ſhould have bin delivered from our
worſt men, who have ſince bin very bad
inſtruments in Affairs, and have terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the reſt by their example: We might
then have quieted the minds of the people
by an Indemnity; brought the Nation to
a ſettlement, and prevented the War
which enſued in this Country. Yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in matters of prudence men are of
different ſentiments) tho it ſhould be
granted, that during the War it was not
fit to make any examples, what pretence
can there be now of exempting from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
thoſe who have bin notoriouſly
criminal, both under the late Reigns, and
under this? Which when it is done, what
conjuncture of time can be ſo proper for
applying the healing Remedy of an Act of
Indemnity and Oblivion to the reſt, as
the preſent, by reaſon of the Peace?</p>
            <p>Before the Revolution, the Court had
bin in a formed Conſpiracy againſt the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61705:22"/>
Religion and Liberties of this Nation;
nor was there any art to introduce Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power, or ſubvert our Religion,
for which the late Reigns wanted willing
Inſtruments; and many endeavoured to
ſignalize themſelves in the ruin of their
Country. Yet no man has bin made an
Example, to deter others from the like
Crimes. It will I know be thought hard
to mention the puniſhing of Offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſo many years ago, when many of
the Offenders are dead; and ſome men
will judg it fitter to bury all in a general
Act of Oblivion. To this I anſwer, that
having bin highly to blame for neglecting
hitherto to puniſh the Enemies of our
Liberty, this ought to oblige us the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make an example of thoſe who are
ſtill living. And to convince us of this
neceſſity, we need only to conſider what
Crimes thoſe men would not have puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor the leaſt example made of any
that have bin guilty of them; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſuffering them to paſs unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
will not bring a guilt upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which may not eaſily be expiated.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61705:23"/>
Publick and private Injuries are of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
different nature; and tho we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to forgive the laſt, yet thoſe who
have Power and Right, are required, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the greateſt penalties, to puniſh the
other, eſpecially where the Crimes are enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
But if the Parliament ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the advice of thoſe men, they are not
to puniſh any violent Proceedings, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
and arbitrary Impriſonments, Fines,
Baniſhments, and Murders under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of Law, that were ſet on foot, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and committed by thoſe evil
Counſellors mentioned in his Majeſty's
Declaration, in order to alter the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Government of this Nation,
and in place of them to introduce Popery
and Slavery. They are not to puniſh
thoſe, who to recommend themſelves to the
late Kings, by their Intereſt, Power, and
Credit in the Parliament, got to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
moſt cruel and unchriſtian Laws,
for perſecuting a great part of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the account of their religious
Opinions, which they could not quit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
violating their Conſciences: They are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61705:23"/>
not to puniſh thoſe Privy Counſellors who
went further than thoſe very Laws would
allow them, in a thouſand arbitrary and
illegal proceedings, iſſuing out Orders to
invade ſuch as diſſented from them only
in religious matters, with an Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for the moſt part of barbarous
Highlanders, who hunted them from
Hill to Hill, to force them to take Arms,
that they might have a pretext to deſtroy
them utterly. They are not to puniſh
thoſe who gave Orders to impoſe illegal
and unwarrantable Oaths upon all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
even on ſilly women that might be
found travelling in the ordinary Road,
and to ſhoot them immediately dead, if
they ſhould refuſe the ſame. Nor are
they to puniſh thoſe who put them in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Do Presbyterians in particular
imagine, that if they neglect their duty
in puniſhing theſe men, they will avoid the
guilt of the innocent blood ſhed in thoſe
times? Are ſuch things to be pardoned
as private Injuries? The making our
Courts of Juſtice, particularly that of
the Seſſion, to be the Inſtruments of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61705:24"/>
all men to arbitrary Power, are
things to be paſſed over in ſilence, and no
account to be taken of them. Thoſe who
adviſed and drew a Proclamation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the late King James his abſolute
Power in expreſs terms, are not to be
queſtioned for it. If the Parliament
paſs over theſe things without making any
example of the Offenders, they make a
Precedent for aboliſhing the puniſhment
of all enormous Crimes for ever, ſince
there never can be greater than theſe.
Shall there be no examples made of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
for enormities of ſuch a general
influence and concernment, in a Nation
where a poor man for ſtealing a little food,
is for Examples ſake (let what I ſay be
conſidered) is for Examples ſake puniſhed
with death? If there can be no ſtop put to
the leaſt of Crimes, but by the puniſhment
of ſome of thoſe that are guilty; can there
be any remedy againſt the abettors of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power, if no example be made of
them? Can that Government be ſaid to be
ſecure, where there is no puniſhment, but
rewards for conſpiracies againſt its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution?
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61705:24"/>
'Tis true that it may be fit to
overlook ſome Crimes, wherein extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
numbers of men are concerned, but
not extraordinary Crimes, nor the moſt
guilty of the Criminals.</p>
            <p>It was thought ſit to forbear the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of the evil Counſellors men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in his Majeſty's Declaration for
ſome time: That forbearance has laſted
to this day; and we have ſo little hopes
of ſeeing any diſcouragement put upon
thoſe who ſhall promote Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in time to come, by an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
puniſhment of the moſt notorious
Offenders under the late Reigns, that
notwithſtanding many new provocations,
and reiterated treaſons under this, they
have not only hitherto eſcaped puniſhment,
but have bin alſo encouraged. For not
long after the Revolution, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
of them (I do not ſpeak of thoſe
who took Arms) entred into new Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
againſt their Country, to betray it
again to the late King James, and took
the Oaths to this King, that they might
have the better opportunity to bring back
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61705:25"/>
the other. Yet after all this his Majeſty
was adviſed to put ſome of them into the
moſt important places of truſt in the
Kingdom. What are we then to expect,
if we ſhall not now proceed to make ſome
examples, but that they, and men of the
like principles, will inſinuate themſelves
into all the places of truſt; and have
the power as well as the will to throw us
into priſons, and by their pernicious
Counſels to betray his preſent Majeſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame misfortunes that were brought
upon the late King? Is it not enough,
that the puniſhment of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to enſlave us under the late
Reigns, has bin delayed till now? Becauſe
they have renewed the ſame Practices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this, muſt it ſtill be delayed, to the
end that (as they have already done in the
Affair of Glenco) they may continue to
give his Majeſty the ſame bad Counſel
with which the late Kings were poiſoned?
Now, to pardon them we have this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
that having paſſed over
former Crimes, we embolden them to
commit new, and to give freſh wounds
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61705:25"/>
to that Country which has already ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bled under their hands.</p>
            <p>When the greateſt Offenders are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
an Act of Indemnity will be as
neceſſary to the well-being of this Nation
as Peace it ſelf, ſince there can be no eaſe
or quiet without it. But ſo little hopes
have we of this, that whilſt the evil
Counſellors, againſt whom his Majeſty
did ſo juſtly declare, live at eaſe; an Act
(as we are told) is to be brought into the
Parliament for baniſhing during plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
many thouſands of inconſiderable
people who cannot be charged with Crimes
any way comparable to theirs; and ſome
of them free of the leaſt appearance of
any. What conſtruction would the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of theſe things, have even thoſe who
are beſt affected to the Government put
upon them? One might reaſonably think
that ſuch things may be ſit to keep up the
Party of the late King James, and fright
the Nation into a belief of the neceſſity of
continuing a Standing Army, that they
may be ſit to lead men of Eſtates, or thoſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61705:26"/>
who have any thing to loſe, into ſnares
both at home and abroad (particularly in
France, where the late King James is
ſtill ſuffered) by pretending correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or converſation with ſuch as may
be obnoxious to the Law: But no man can
ſuſpect the worſt of Counſellors of ſuch
deſigns. And therefore I confeſs I am at
a ſtand; for ſuch vaſt numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were never yet baniſhed for crimes of
State: nor dos the multitude ever ſuffer
for them, except only in barbarous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
If it be ſaid that ill men may have
deſigns againſt his Majeſty's Life, and
therefore ought to be baniſhed; I anſwer,
Nothing is more likely to draw on ſuch a
miſchief, than extraordinary ſeverities
uſed againſt them. For nothing dos ſo
much ſit a man for ſuch an attempt, as
deſpair; againſt which no diſtance of place
can long protect.</p>
            <p>My opinion therefore is, that an Act
of Indemnity (exceping only Aſſaſſins and
other notorious Criminals, whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
at preſent reach) is more ſutable
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61705:26"/>
to our preſent condition, than an Act
of Baniſhment: and that to procure
the Nation ſo great a bleſſing, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhould proceed, without delay,
to the puniſhing of the greateſt Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
both of this and the laſt Reigns,
without which an Oblivion will be one
of the greateſt Injuries that can be done
to us.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, That there is
ground to believe ſome men will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to perſwade the Parliament to take
this Affair into conſideration before all
others; becauſe it was the firſt thing
done in the laſt Seſſion of the Engliſh
Parliament; and the Bill having paſt
there almoſt without debate, they will make
uſe of that as an Argument why it ſhould
do ſo here. What the conſiderations were
which moved that Parliament to do ſo, I
will not preſume to determine, neither is
it my buſineſs: Circumſtances of Affairs
may be different in different Nations:
Sure I am, that in this particular they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61705:27"/>
are different, that a greater number of
men, in proportion to the people in each
Nation, will fall under uneaſy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
by ſuch an Act in Scotland, than
has bin found to have done in England.</p>

Concerning the
AFFAIRS of SCOTLAND,
Written in the Year 1698.</head>
            <p>THE Affairs of which I have
ſpoken in the preceding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
are ſuch as the preſent
conjuncture makes a proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for the approaching Seſſion of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament:
but there are many other things
which require no leſs their care, if the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and preſſing diſtreſſes of the Nation
be conſider'd. I ſhall therefore with all
due reſpect to the Parliament offer my
opinion concerning two, which I preſume
to be of that nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61705:28"/>
The firſt thing which I humbly and
earneſtly propoſe to that Honourable Court
is, that they would take into their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
the condition of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of our People who are at this day dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for want of Bread. And to perſwade
them ſeriouſly to apply themſelves to ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible
a duty, they have all the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which thoſe moſt powerful emotions
of the Soul, Terror and Compaſſion, can
produce. Becauſe from unwholſom Food
diſeaſes are ſo multiplied among the poor
People, that if ſome courſe be not taken,
this Famine may very probably be followed
by a Plague; and then what man is there
even of thoſe who ſit in Parliament that
can be ſure he ſhall eſcape? And what
man is there in this Nation, if he have
any Compaſſion, who muſt not grudg him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
every nice bit and every delicate mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
he puts in his Mouth, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
that ſo many are already dead, and
ſo many at that minute ſtrugling with
death, not for want of Bread but of
Grains, which I am credibly informed
have bin eaten by ſome Families, even
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61705:28"/>
during the preceding years of Scarcity.
And muſt not every unneceſſary branch of
our expence, or the leaſt ſinery in our
Houſes, Clothes or Equipage, reproach us
with our barbarity, ſo long as People born
with natural Endowments, perhaps not
inferior to our own, and fellow Citizens,
periſh for want of things abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to life?</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt any more upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of ſo great a Calamity, which
if drawn in proper colours, and only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the preciſe truth of things, muſt
caſt the minds of all honeſt men into thoſe
convulſions which ought neceſſarily to be
compoſed before they can calmly conſider of
a remedy; and becauſe the particulars of
this great diſtreſs are ſufficiently known to
all, I ſhall proceed to ſay, that tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
upon the great want of Bread, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by the continued bad ſeaſons of this
and the three preceding years, the evil be
greater and more preſſing than at any time
in our days, yet there have always bin in
Scotland ſuch numbers of poor, as by no
regulations could ever be orderly provided
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61705:29"/>
for; and this Country has always ſwarm'd
with ſuch numbers of idle Vagabonds, as
no Laws could ever reſtrain. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
when I conſider'd the many excellent
Laws enacted by former Parliaments for
ſetting the Poor to work, particularly thoſe
in the time of King James the ſixth,
with the Clauſes for putting them in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
which to me ſeemed ſuch as could not
miſs of the end, and yet that nothing was
obtained by them, I was amazed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think upon the caſe of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in this particular, perſwaded that there
was ſome ſtrange hidden root of this evil
which could not be well diſcovered, unleſs
by obſerving the conduct of other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But upon reflection I found them
all ſubject to the ſame inconveniences,
and that in all the Countries of Europe
there were great numbers of Poor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in Holland, which I knew to proceed
from their having the greateſt ſhare in the
Trade of the World. But this not being
a remedy for every Country, ſince all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
pretend to ſo great a part in Trade, and
that two or three Nations are able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61705:29"/>
the whole Commerce of Europe; yet
there being a neceſſity that the Poor ſhould
every where be provided for, unleſs we will
acknowledg the deficiency of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in that particular, and finding no
remedy in the Laws or Cuſtoms of any of
the preſent Governments, I began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what might be the conduct of the wiſe
Antients in that affair. And my curioſity
was increaſed, when upon reflection I could
not call to mind that any antient Author
had ſo much as mentioned ſuch a thing,
as great numbers of poor in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>At length I found the original of that
multitude of Beggars which now oppreſs
the World, to have proceeded from Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who (never failing to confound things
Spiritual with Temporal, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all good Order and good Government,
either through miſtake or deſign) upon the
firſt publick eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian
Religion, recommended nothing more to
Maſters, in order to the Salvation of their
Souls, than the ſetting ſuch of their
Slaves at liberty as would embrace the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61705:30"/>
Chriſtian Faith, tho our Saviour and his
Apoſtles had bin ſo far from making uſe
of any Temporal advantages to perſwade
eternal truths, and ſo far from invading
any man's property, by promiſing him
Heaven for it, that the Apoſtle Paul
ſays expreſly, <q>In what ever condition of
Life every one is called to the Chriſtian
Faith, in that let him remain. Art
thou called being a ſlave? be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for thy condition; but even
tho thou mighteſt be free, chuſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in it. For he who is called whilſt
a ſlave, becomes the freeman of the
Lord; and likewiſe he that is called
whilſt a free-man, becomes the ſlave of
Chriſt, who has paid a price for you,
that you might not be the ſlaves of men.
Let every one therefore, Brethren, in
whatever condition he is called, in
that remain, in the fear of God.</q> That
the interpretation I put upon this paſſage,
different from our Tranſlation, is the
true meaning of the Apoſtle, not only the
authority of the Greek Fathers, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ſignification of the Greek Particles,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61705:30"/>
but the whole context, chiefly the firſt and
laſt words (which ſeem to be repeated to
inforce and determine ſuch a meaning)
clearly demonſtrate. And the reaſon why
he recommends to them rather to continue
ſlaves (if they have embraced the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith in that condition) ſeems to be
that it might appear they did not embrace
it for any worldly advantage, as well as to
deſtroy a Doctrine which even in his days
began to be preached, that ſlavery was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with the Chriſtian Religion; ſince
ſuch a Doctrine would have bin a great
ſtop to the progreſs of it. What the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
means by ſaying, we ought not to
be the ſlaves of men, I ſhall ſhow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>This diſorder of giving liberty to great
numbers of ſlaves upon their profeſſion of
Chriſtianity, grew to ſuch a height, even
in the time of Conſtantine the Great,
that the Cities of the Empire found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
burden'd with an infinite number of
men, who had no other eſtate but their
liberty, of whom the greateſt part would
not work, and the reſt had bin bred to no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61705:31"/>
profeſſion. This obliged Conſtantine to
make Edicts in favour of Beggars; and
from that time at the requeſt of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
Hoſpitals and Alms-houſes, not
formerly known in the world, began to be
eſtabliſhed. But upon the riſe of the
Mahometan Religion, which was chiefly
advanced by giving liberty to all their
ſlaves, the Chriſtians were ſo moleſted by
the continual Rebellion of theirs, that
they were at length forced to give liberty
to them all; which it ſeems the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
then looked upon as a thing neceſſary
to preſerve the Chriſtian Religion, ſince
in many of the Writings, by which Maſters
gave freedom to their Slaves, 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaid, they did ſo, to ſave their own
Souls.</p>
            <p>This is the riſe of that great miſchief,
under which, to the undoing of the Poor,
all the Nations of Europe have ever ſince
groan'd. Becauſe in antient times, ſo
long as a man was the riches and part of
the poſſeſſion of another, every man was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for in Meat, Clothes and Lodging;
and not only he, but (in order to increaſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61705:31"/>
that riches) his Wife and Children alſo:
Whereas Proviſions by Hoſpitals, Alms-houſes,
and the contributions of Churches
or Pariſhes, have by experience bin found
to increaſe the numbers of thoſe that live
by them. And the liberty every idle and
lazy Perſon has of burdening the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
in which he lives, with his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
has increaſed their numbers to
the weakning and impoveriſhing of it:
For he needs only to ſay, that he cannot
get work, and then he muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by Charity. And as I have ſhown
before, no Nation except one only (which
is in extraordinary Circumſtances) dos
provide by publick Work-houſes for their
Poor: the reaſon of which ſeems to be,
that publick Work-houſes for ſuch vaſt
numbers of People, are impracticable
except in thoſe places where (beſides a vaſt
Trade to vend the manufactur'd Goods)
there is an extraordinary Police: And
that tho the Hollanders by reaſon of the
ſteddineſs of their Temper, as well as
of their Government (being a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth)
may be conſtant to their methods
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61705:32"/>
of providing for the Poor; yet in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and under a Government like that of
France, tho vaſt publick Workhouſes may
be for a while kept in order, 'twill not
be long before they fall into confuſion
and ruin. And indeed (next to Plato's
Republick, which chiefly conſiſts in making
the whole Society live in common) there
is nothing more impracticable than to
provide for ſo great a part of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by publick Work-houſes. Whereas
when ſuch an Oeconomy comes under the
inſpection of every maſter of a Family,
and that he himſelf is to reap the profit
of the right management; the thing not
only turns to a far better account, but by
reaſon of his power to ſell thoſe Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to others who may have uſe for
them, when he himſelf has a mind to
alter his courſe of Life, the profit is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
to the Society; nor can ſuch an
Oeconomy, or any ſuch management ever
fall into confuſion.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, that what I have ſaid
will meet, not only with all the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
and obloquy, but all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61705:32"/>
fury and outcries, of which either
ignorant Magiſtrates, or proud, lazy
and miſerable people are capable. Would
I bring back Slavery into the world? Shall
men of immortal Souls, and by nature e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to any, be ſold as Beaſts? Shall they
and their poſterity be for ever ſubjected
to the moſt miſerable of all conditions;
the inhuman barbarity of Maſters, who
may beat, mutilate, torture, ſtarve or
kill ſo great a number of mankind at
pleaſure? Shall the far greater part of
the Commonwealth be Slaves, not that the
reſt may be free, but Tyrants over them?
With what face can we oppoſe the tyranny
of Princes, and recommend ſuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
as the higheſt Virtue, if we make
our ſelves Tyrants over the greateſt part
of mankind? Can any man, from whom
ſuch a thing has once eſcaped, ever offer
to ſpeak for Liberty? But they muſt
pardon me if I tell them, that I regard
not names, but things; and that the
miſapplication of names has confounded
every thing. We are told there is not a
Slave in France; that when a Slave ſets
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61705:33"/>
his foot upon French ground, he becomes
immediately free: and I ſay that there is
not a Free man in France, becauſe the
King takes away any part of any man's
Property at his pleaſure; and that, let
him do what he will to any man, there is
no remedy. The Turks tell us there are
no Slaves among them, except Jews,
Moors, or Chriſtians; and who is there
that knows not, they are all Slaves to the
Grand Signor, and have no remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his will? A Slave properly is one,
who is abſolutely ſubjected to the will of
another man without any remedy: and not
one that is only ſubjected under certain
limitations, and upon certain accounts
neceſſary for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
tho ſuch an one may go under
that name. And the confounding theſe
two conditions of men by a name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both, has in my opinion bin none
of the leaſt hardſhips put upon thoſe who
ought to be named Servants. We are all
ſubjected to the Laws; and the eaſier or
harder conditions impoſed by them upon
the ſeveral ranks of men in any Society,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61705:33"/>
make not the diſtinction that is between a
Freeman and a Slave.</p>
            <p>So that the condition of Slaves among
the Antients, will upon ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appear to be only a better proviſion
in their Governments than any we have,
that no man might want the neceſſities of
life, nor any perſon able to work be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom
to the Commonwealth. And they
wiſely judged of the Inconveniences that
befal the moſt part of poor people, when
they are all abandoned to their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
I know that theſe two conditions
of men were confounded under the ſame
name, as well by the Antients as they
are by us; but the reaſon was, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often taken in War the Subjects of
Abſolute Monarchs, they thought they
did them no wrong if they did not better
their condition: and as in ſome of their
Governments the condition of Slaves was
under a worſe regulation than in others,
ſo in ſome of them it differ'd very little,
if at all, from the condition of ſuch a
Slave as I have defined. But I do not
approve, and therefore will not go about
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61705:34"/>
to defend any of thoſe bad and cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations
about Slaves. And becauſe it
would be tedious and needleſs to purſue
the various conditions of them in ſeveral
Ages and Governments, it ſhall be enough
for me to explain under what conditions
they might be both good and uſeful, as
well as I think they are neceſſary in a well-regulated
Government.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, their Maſters ſhould not
have power over their lives, but the life
of the Maſter ſhould go for the life of
the Servant. The Maſter ſhould have
no power to mutilate or torture him;
That in ſuch caſes the Servant ſhould
not only have his freedom (which alone
would make him burdenſom to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick)
but a ſufficient yearly penſion ſo
long as he ſhould live from his ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.
That he, his Wife and Children,
ſhould be provided for in Clothes, Diet,
and Lodging. That they ſhould be taught
the principles of Morality and Religion;
to read, and be allowed the uſe of certain
Books: That they ſhould not work upon
Sundays, and be allowed to go to Church:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61705:34"/>
That in every thing, except their duty as
Servants, they ſhould not be under the
will of their Maſters, but the protection
of the Law: That when theſe Servants
grow old, and are no more uſeful to their
Maſters, (leſt upon that account they
ſhould be ill uſed) Hoſpitals ſhould be
provided for them by the Publick: That
if for their good and faithful ſervice,
any Maſter give them their freedom, he
ſhould be obliged to give them likewiſe
wherewithal to ſubſist, or put them in a
way of living without being troubleſome
to the Commonwealth: That they ſhould
wear no habit or mark to diſtinguiſh them
from hired Servants: That any man
ſhould be puniſhed who gives them the
opprobrious name of Slave. So, except
it were that they could poſſeſs nothing, and
might be ſold, which really would be but
an alienation of their Service without
their conſent, they would live in a much
more comfortable condition (wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
neceſſary for life) than thoſe who
having a power to poſſeſs all things, are
very often in want of every thing, to ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61705:35"/>
a degree, that many thouſands of them
come to ſtarve for hunger.</p>
            <p>It will be ſaid, that notwithſtanding
all theſe regulations, they may be moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly
uſed by their Maſters, either by
beating them outragiouſly, making them
work beyond meaſure, ſuffer cold or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or neglecting them in their ſickneſs.
I anſwer, That as long as the Servant is
of an age not unſit for work, all theſe
things are againſt the intereſt of the
Maſter: That the moſt brutal man will
not uſe his beaſt ill only out of a humor;
and that if ſuch Inconveniences do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
fall out, it proceeds, for the moſt
part, from the perverſeneſs of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant:
That all Inconveniences cannot be
obviated by any Government; that we
muſt chuſe the leaſt; and that to prevent
them in the beſt manner poſſible, a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Magiſtrate might be inſtituted for
that end.</p>
            <p>The condition of ſuch a Servant is to
be eſteemed free; becauſe in the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
things, he is only ſubject to the
Laws, and not to the will of his Maſter,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61705:35"/>
who can neither take away his life, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
torture, or reſtrain him from the
comforts of Wife and Children: But on
the other hand, for the ſervice he dos, is
obliged to eaſe him of the inconveniences
of marriage, by providing for him, his
wife, and children, clothes, food, and
lodging: and the condition of a Baſchaw,
or great Lord, under Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(who for the ſake, and from a
neceſſity of what they call Government,
has joined to the quality of a Slave the
office of a Tyrant, and imagins himſelf a
man of Quality, if not a little Prince,
by ſuch preeminence) is altogether ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh;
ſince he is under the protection of
no Law, no not ſo much as to his life,
or the honour of his wife and children;
and is ſubjected to ſtronger temptations
than any man, of being a ſlave to men in
St. Paul's ſenſe, which is a worſe ſort of
ſlavery than any I have yet mentioned.
That is, of being ſubſervient to, and an
inſtrument of the luſts of his maſter the
Tyrant: ſince if he refuſe ſlaviſhly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
he muſt loſe his office, and perhaps
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61705:36"/>
his life. And indeed men of all ranks
living under Arbitrary Government (ſo
much preached and recommended by the
far greater part of Churchmen) being
really under the protection of no Law,
(whatever may be pretended) are not only
Slaves, as I have deſined before, but by
having no other certain remedy in any
thing againſt the luſt and paſſions of their
Superiors, except ſuffering or comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
lie under the moſt violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of being Slaves in the worſt ſenſe,
and of the only ſort that is inconſistent
with the Chriſtian Religion. A condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(whatever men may imagine) ſo
much more miſerable than that of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
protected by the Laws in all things
neceſſary for the ſubſistence of them and
their Poſterity, that there is no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
the Antients received from
this ſort of Servants. By thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for their poor, and making every
man uſeful to the Commonwealth, they
were not only able to perform thoſe great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61705:36"/>
and ſtupendous publick works, High-ways,
Aqueducts, Common-ſhores, Walls of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Sea-ports, Bridges, Monuments for
the Dead, Temples, Amphitheatres, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters,
places for all manner of Exerciſes
and Education, Baths, Courts of Juſtice,
Market-places, publick Walks, and other
magnificent Works for the uſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of the Publick; with which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Aſia, Greece, Italy, and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were filled; and to adorn them with
ſtately Pillars and Obelisks, curious Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
moſt exquiſite Sculpture and Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
but every particular man might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
himſelf in any kind of finery and
magnificence; not only becauſe he had
Slaves to perform it according to his
fancy, but becauſe all the poor being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, there could be no crime in
making unneceſſary expences, which are
always contrary, not only to Chriſtian
Charity, but common Humanity, as long
as any poor man wants bread. For tho
we think that in making thoſe expences,
we employ the poor; and that in building
coſtly Houſes, and furniſhing them, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61705:37"/>
fine Gardens, rich Stuffs, Laces and
Embroideries for Apparel, the poor are
ſet to work; yet ſo long as all the poor
are not provided for, (tho a man cannot
reproach to himſelf in particular why it
is not done) and that there is any poor
family in a ſtarving condition, 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
common humanity (and no doubt
would have bin judged to be ſo by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients)
for any man to indulge himſelf in
things unneceſſary, when others want
what is abſolutely neceſſary for life, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſince the furniſhing of thoſe things
to them, does employ Workmen as well as
our unneceſſary expences. So that the
Antients, without giving the leaſt check
to a tender compaſſion for the neceſſities of
others (a virtue ſo natural to great
minds, ſo nicely to be preſerved and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed)
might not only adorn their publick
Buildings with all the reſinements of Art,
but likewiſe beautify their private Houſes,
Villa's and Gardens with the greateſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.
But we by perſiſting in the
like, and other unneceſſary expences, while
all the poor are not provided for (exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61705:37"/>
vanity, and the love of pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
predominant in us) have not only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
all the veſtiges of Chriſtian Charity,
but baniſhed natural compaſſion from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, that without remorſe we might
continue in them.</p>
            <p>This explains to us by what means ſo
much virtue and ſimplicity of manners
could ſubſist in the Cities of Greece, and
the leſſer Aſia, in the midſt of ſo great
curioſity and reſinement in the Arts of
Magnificence and Ornament. For in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
times great Riches, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bad Arts to acquire them, were not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for thoſe things; becauſe if a
man poſſeſſed a moderate number of
Slaves, he might chuſe to employ them in
any ſort of magnificence, either private
or publick, for uſe or ornament, as he
thought ſit, whilſt he himſelf lived in the
greateſt ſimplicity, having neither Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
nor Horſes to carry him, as in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
through the City; nor a family in
moſt things compoſed like that of a Prince,
and a multitude of idle Servants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
his Eſtate. Women were not then
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61705:38"/>
intolerably expenſive, but wholly imployed
in the care of domeſtick Affairs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the furniture of their houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to ſuch vaſt ſums as with us;
but was for the moſt part wrought by
their Slaves.</p>
            <p>Another advantage which the Antients
had by this ſort of Servants, was, That
they were not under that uneaſineſs, and
unſpeakable vexation which we ſuffer by
our hired Servants, who are never bred
to be good for any thing, tho moſt of
the Slaves amongst the Antients were.
And tho we beſtow the greateſt pains or
coſt to educate one of them from his youth,
upon the leaſt croſs word he leaves us. So
that 'tis more than probable this ſort of
Servants growing every day worſe, the
unſpeakable trouble ariſing from them,
without any other conſideration, will
force the world to return to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>Among the Antients, any Maſter who
had the leaſt judgment or diſcretion, was
ſerved with emulation by all his Slaves,
that thoſe who beſt performed their duty,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61705:38"/>
might obtain their liberty from him. A
Slave, tho furniſhed with every thing
neceſſary, yet poſſeſſing nothing, had no
temptation to cheat his Maſter; whereas
a hired Servant, whilſt he remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
will cheat his Maſter of what may
be a ſtock to him when married; and if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his marriage he continue to ſerve his
Maſter, he will be ſure to cheat him much
more. When the Antients gave free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to a Slave, they were obliged to give
him wherewithal to ſubſist, or to put him
into a way of living. And how well and
faithfully they were ſerved by thoſe they had
made free, (whom from a long experience
of their probity and capacity, they often
made Stewards of their Eſtates) all antient
Hiſtory dos teſtify. Now, we having no
regular way to enable a Servant to provide
ſufficient maintenance for his Family,
when he becomes independent on his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
his bare Wages (out of which he is
for the moſt part to provide himſelf with
many neceſſaries for daily uſe) not being
enough for that purpoſe, and no way left
but to cheat his Maſter, we ought not to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61705:39"/>
expect any probity or fidelity in our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
becauſe, for want of order in this
point, we ſubject them to ſuch ſtrong
temptations.</p>
            <p>I might inſist upon many other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
the Antients had in the way they
were ſerved, if to perſwade the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
I propoſe, I were not to make uſe of
ſtronger Arguments than ſuch as can be
drawn from any advantages; I mean thoſe
of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>There are at this day in Scotland (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a great many poor Families very
meanly provided for by the Church-boxes,
with others, who by living upon bad Food
fall into various diſeaſes) 200000 People
begging from door to door. Theſe are
not only no way advantageous, but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
grievous burden to ſo poor a Country.
And tho the number of them be perhaps
double to what it was formerly, by reaſon
of this preſent great diſtreſs, yet in all
times there have bin about 100000 of thoſe
Vagabonds, who have lived without any
regard or ſubjection either to the Laws of
the Land, or even thoſe of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61705:39"/>
Fathers inceſtuouſly accompanying
with their own Daughters, the Son with
the Mother, and the Brother with the
Siſter. No Magiſtrate could ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
or be informed which way one in a
hundred of theſe wretches died, or that
ever they were baptized. Many murders
have bin diſcovered among them; and
they are not only a moſt unſpeakable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
to poor Tenants, (who if they
give not Bread, or ſome kind of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to perhaps forty ſuch Villains in one
day, are ſure to be inſulted by them) but
they rob many poor People who live in
Houſes diſtant from any Neighbourhood.
In years of Plenty many thouſands of
them meet together in the Mountains,
where they feaſt and riot for many days;
and at country Weddings, Markets, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
and other the like publick occaſions,
they are to be ſeen both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
perpetually drunk, curſing, blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſighting together.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch outragious diſorders,
that it were better for the Nation they
were ſold to the Gallies or Weſt-Indies,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61705:40"/>
than that they ſhould continue any longer
to be a burden and curſe upon us. But
numbers of People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being great riches,
every Government is to blame that makes
not a right uſe of them. The wholſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our Air, and healthfulneſs of our
Climat, affords us great numbers of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which in ſo poor a Country can never
be all maintained by Manufactures, or
publick Work-houſes, or any other way,
but that which I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>And to ſhow that former Parliaments
ſtrugling with this, otherwiſe inſuperable,
difficulty, have by the nature of the thing
bin as it were forced upon remedies tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards what I have propoſed: By
an Act of Parliament in the year 1579.
any ſubject of ſufficient Eſtate is allowed
to take the Child of any Beggar, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
him for his Service, which Child is
obliged to ſerve ſuch a Maſter for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
term of years; and that term of
years extended by another Act made in the
year 1597, for Life. So that here is a
great advance towards my Propoſition;
but either from ſome miſtake about Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61705:40"/>
or Civil liberty, they did not proceed
to conſider the neceſſity of continuing that
ſervice in the Children of ſuch Servants,
and giving their Maſters a power of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating
that ſervice to whom they ſhould
think fit. The reaſon for the firſt of
theſe is, that being married in that ſort
of ſervice, their Maſters muſt of neceſſity
maintain their Wife and Children, and
ſo ought to have the ſame right to the
ſervice of the Children as of the Father.
And the reaſon for the power of Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, that no man is ſure of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always in one ſort of Employment;
and having educated a great many ſuch
Children when he was in an Employment
that required many Servants, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he ſhould be obliged to quit it for
one that required few or none, he could
not without great injuſtice be deprived of
the power of alienating their ſervice to
any other man, in order to reimburſe to
himſelf the mony he had beſtowed upon
them; eſpecially ſince the ſetting them at
liberty would only bring a great burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the publick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61705:41"/>
Now what I would propoſe upon the
whole matter is, that for ſome preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of ſo great a miſchief, every man of
a certain Eſtate in this Nation ſhould be
obliged to take a proportionable number
of thoſe Vagabonds, and either employ them
in hedging and ditching his Grounds, or
any other ſort of work in Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
or if they happen to be Children and
young, that he ſhould educate them in the
knowledg of ſome mechanical Art, that ſo
every man of Eſtate might have a little
Manufacture at home which might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thoſe Servants, and bring great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to the Maſter, as they did to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
whoſe revenue by the Manufactures
of ſuch Servants was much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
than that of their Lands. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals
and Alms-houſes ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for the ſick, lame and decrepit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by rectifying old foundations or inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
new. And for example and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
three or four hundred of the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
of thoſe Villains which we call
Jockys, might be preſented by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the State of Venice, to ſerve in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61705:41"/>
their Gallies againſt the common enemy of
Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>But theſe things, when once reſolved,
muſt be executed with great addreſs, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and ſeverity; for that ſort of
People is ſo deſperately wicked, ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of all Work and Labour, and, which
is yet more amazing, ſo proud, in eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own condition above that which
they will be ſure to call ſlavery; that unleſs
prevented by the utmoſt induſtry and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
upon the firſt publication of any
orders neceſſary for putting in execution
ſuch a deſign, they will rather die with
hunger in Caves and Dens, and murder
their young Children, than appear abroad to
have them and themſelves taken into ſuch a
kind of ſervice. And the Highlands are
ſuch a vaſt and unſearchable retreat for
them, that if ſtrict and ſevere order be
not taken to prevent it, upon ſuch an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
theſe Vagabonds will only rob as
much food as they can out of the Low-country,
and retire to live upon it in thoſe
Mountains, or run into England till they
think the ſtorm of our reſolutions is over,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61705:42"/>
which in all former times they have ſeen
to be vain.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed can there be a thorow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in this Affair, ſo long as the
one half of our Country, in extent of
ground, is poſſeſſed by a People who are,
all Gentlemen only becauſe they will not
work, and who in every thing are more
contemptible than the vileſt ſlaves, except
that they always carry Arms, becauſe for
the moſt part they live upon robbery. This
part of the Country being an inexhauſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſource of Beggers, has always broke all
our meaſures relating to them. And it
were to be wiſhed that the Government
would think ſit to tranſplant that hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of People, and their Maſters (who
have always diſturbed our peace) into the
Low-Country, and people the Highlands
from hence, rather than they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to be a perpetual occaſion of miſchief
to us. 'Tis in vain to ſay, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
People are planted in thoſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
they will quickly turn as ſavage,
and as great Beggers as the preſent Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants;
for the Mountains of the Alps
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61705:42"/>
are greater, more deſert, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to ſnows than thoſe of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
of Scotland, which are every where
out by Friths and Lakes, the richeſt in
Fiſhing of any in the world, aſſording
great conveniences for tranſportation of
Timber and any other Goods; and yet the
Alps which have no ſuch advantages are
inhabited every where by a civiliz'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious,
honeſt, and peaceable People:
but they had no Lords to hinder them
from being civilized, to diſcourage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
incourage thieving, and to keep
them Beggers that they might be the more
dependent; or when they had any that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
them, as in that part of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that belongs to the Swiſs, they knock'd
them on the head.</p>
            <p>Let us now compare the condition of
our preſent Vagabonds with that of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
under the conditions which I have
propoſed, and we ſhall ſee the one living
under no Law of God, Man or Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
polluted with all manner of abominations;
and tho in ſo little expectation of the
good things of another Life, yet in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61705:43"/>
worſt condition of this, and ſometimes
ſtarved to death in time of extraordinary
want. The other, tho ſometimes they
may fall under a ſevere Maſter (who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
may neither kill, mutilate, nor
torture them, and may be likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
from uſing them very ill by the
Magiſtrate I mention'd) are always ſure
to have Food, Clothes and Lodging; and
have this advantage above other men,
that without any care or pains taken by
them, theſe neceſſaries are likewiſe ſecured
to their Wives and Children. They are
provided for in ſickneſs, their Children
are educated, and all of them under all
the inducements, encouragements and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
poſſible to live quiet, innocent
and virtuous Lives. They may alſo hope,
if they ſhew an extraordinary affection,
care and ſidelity in the ſervice of their
Maſter, that not only they and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
ſhall have their intire freedom,
but a competency to live, and perhaps the
Eſtate of the Maſter intruſted to their
care. Now if we will conſider the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
to the Nation by the one, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61705:43"/>
the diſadvantages ariſing from the other
ſort of men, we ſhall evidently ſee, that
as the one is an exceſſive burden, curſe,
and reproach to us, ſo the other may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the Nation, and adorn this Country
with publick works beyond any in Europe,
which ſhall not take the like methods of
providing for their Poor.</p>
            <p>This Propoſal I hope may be a remedy,
not only to that intolerable plague of idle
Vagabonds who infeſt the Nation; but by
providing a more regular maintenance
for them, go a great way towards the
preſent relief of other poor People who
have bin oppreſſed by them. That which
follows is calculated to remove the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
and original cauſe of the Poverty
which all the Commons of this Nation
lie under, as well as thoſe ſtraitning dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
in which men of Eſtates are by
our preſent method of Husbandry inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
involved.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of the preſent poverty and
miſery in which the Commonalty of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
live, are many, yet they are all to be
imputed to our own bad conduct and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61705:44"/>
of our Affairs. 'Tis true,
Trade being of late years vaſtly increaſed
in Europe, the poverty of any Nation is
always imputed to their want of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
And tho our Soil be barren;
yet our Seas being the richeſt of any in the
world, it may be thought that the cauſe
of all our Poverty has bin the neglect of
Trade, and chiefly of our own Fiſhing:
Nevertheleſs were I to aſſign the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
and original ſource of our Poverty,
I ſhould place it in the letting of our
Lands at ſo exceſſive a rate as makes the
Tenant poorer even than his Servant
whoſe Wages he cannot pay; and involves
in the ſame miſery Day-labourers, Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the leſſer Merchants who live in
the Country Villages and Towns; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
influences no leſs the great Towns and
wholeſale Merchants, makes the Maſter
have a troubleſome and ill paid Rent, his
Lands not improved by incloſure or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
but for want of Horſes and Oxen
ſit for labour, every where run out and
abuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61705:44"/>
The condition of the leſſer Freeholders
or Heritors (as we call them) is not much
better than that of our Tenants: for
they have no Stocks to improve their
Lands, and living not as Husbandmen
but as Gentlemen, they are never able to
attain any: Beſides this, the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their wretched and half-ſtarved
Servants is ſuch, that their Lands are
no better cultivated than thoſe labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by beggerly Tenants. And tho a
Gentleman of Eſtate take a Farm into
his own hands, yet Servants are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
or lazy, and the Country People
ſuch enemies of all manner of incloſure,
that after having ſtrugled with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
difficulties, he at laſt finds it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him to alter the ordinary bad
methods, whilſt the reſt of the Country
continues in them.</p>
            <p>The places in this Country which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Sheep and black Cattel, have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for them in Winter during the
Snows, having neither Hay nor Straw,
nor any incloſure to ſhelter them or the
Graſs from the cold eaſterly Winds in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61705:45"/>
the Spring; ſo that the Beaſts are in a
dying condition, and the Graſs conſumed
by thoſe deſtructive Winds, till the warm
weather, about the middle of June, come
to the relief of both. To all this may be
added the letting of Farms in moſt part
of thoſe grazing Countries every year by
Roop or Auction. But our management
in the Countries cultivated by Tillage is
much worſe, becauſe the Tenant pays his
Rent in Grain, Wheat, Barly or Oats:
which is attended with many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and much greater diſadvantages than
a Rent paid in Mony.</p>
            <p>Mony Rent has a yearly balance in it;
for if the year be ſcarce, all ſorts of Grain
yield the greater price; and if the year be
plentiful, there is the greater quantity of
them to make Mony. Now a Rent paid
in Corn has neither a yearly, nor any ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
at all; for if a plentiful year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
a ſuperplus, the Tenant can make
but little of it; but if the year be ſcarce,
he falls ſhort in the payment of his Corn,
and by reaſon of the price it bears, can
never clear that Debt by the rates of a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61705:45"/>
plentiful year, by which means he breaks,
and contributes to ruin his Maſter. The
Rent being altogether in Corn, the
Grounds muſt be altogether in Tillage;
which has bin the ruin of all the beſt
Countries in Scotland. The carriage of
Corn paid for Rent, to which many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
are obliged, being often to remote
places, and at unſeaſonable times, deſtroys
their Horſes, and hinders their labour.
And the hazard of ſending the Corn by
Sea to the great Towns, endangers the
loſs of the whole. The Maſter runs a
double riſque for his Rent, from the
Merchant as well as the Tenant; and the
Merchant making a thouſand difficulties
at the delivering of the Corn if the price
be fallen, the bargain ſometimes ends in
a ſuit at Law. The ſelling of Corn is
become a thing ſo difficult, that beſides
the cheats uſed in that ſort of Commerce,
ſufficient to diſguſt any honeſt man, the
Brewers, Bakers, and ſometimes the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
who ſend it abroad, do ſo combine
together, that the Gentleman is obliged
to lay it up, of which the trouble as well
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61705:46"/>
as loſs is great. This cauſes him to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Mony for the ſupply of his preſent
occaſions, and is the beginning of moſt
mens Debts. We may add to this, that
by a Rent in Corn, a man comes to have
one year 1000 l. Rent, and the next per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
but 600, ſo that he never can make
any certain account for his expence or
way of living; that having one year
1000 l. to ſpend, he cannot eaſily reſtrain
himſelf to 600 the next; that he ſpends
the ſame quantity of Corn (and in ſome
places where ſuch things are delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Rent) Hay, Straw, Poultry,
Sheep and Oxen, in a dear, as in a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
year, which he would not do if he
was obliged to buy them. Now the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in a plentiful year waſts, and in a
ſcarce year ſtarves: ſo that no man of
any ſubſtance will take a Farm in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
but every Begger if he have got
half a dozen wretched Horſes, and as
many Oxen, and can borrow Corn to ſow,
pretends to be a Tenant in places where
they pay no other Rent than Corn.</p>
            <p>I know there are many objections made
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61705:46"/>
to what has bin ſaid concerning the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which a Rent paid in Mony has
above one paid in Corn; but certainly
they are all ſo frivolous, that every man
upon a little reſtections may anſwer them
to himſelf. For the chief of them are,
either that the Tenant will ſquander away
Mony when he gets it into his hands; or
that the Maſter can get a better price for
the Corn by ſelling it in groſs to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in the adjacent Towns, or elſe by
ſending it to be ſold at a great diſtance.
To the firſt I anſwer, that no ſubſtantial
man will ſquander away Mony becauſe he
has got it into his hands, tho ſuch Beggers
as we now have for Tenants might be apt
to do ſo. And to the ſecond, that the
hazard of ſending Corn from one place
of the Kingdom to another by Sea, and
the prejudice the Tenants ſuffer from long
carriages by Land, do in part balance the
ſuppoſed advantage; beſides, if thoſe
wholeſale bargains were not ſo frequently
made, nor the Corn ſo often carried to be
ſold at the great Towns, the Merchants
would be obliged to ſend to the Country
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61705:47"/>
Markets to buy, and the prices in them
would riſe. In ſhort, the changing of
Mony-rent into Corn, has bin the chief
cauſe of racking all the Rents to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
rate they are now advanced. And
upon reflection it will ſoon appear, that
the turning of Mony Rents into Rents of
Corn, has bin the invention of ſome cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
wretches, who have bin the occaſion
that all Maſters now live under the ſame
uneaſineſs, and conſtant care, which they
at firſt out of covetouſneſs created to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and all to get as much as was
poſſible from poor Tenants, who by
ſuch means are made miſerable, and are
ſo far from improving, that they only
run out and ſpoil the Ground, ruin their
Neighbours by borrowing, and at length
break for conſiderable Sums, tho at firſt
they were no better than Beggers.</p>
            <p>The method of moſt other Countries is;
That all Rents are payed in Mony; That
Maſters receiving a Fine, grant long
Leaſes of their Grounds at eaſy Rents:
but this ſuppoſes the Tenant a man of
conſiderable ſubſtance, who cannot only
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61705:47"/>
give a Fine, but has wherewithal to ſtock,
and alſo to improve his Farm. But in
Scotland no ſuch men are willing to take
Farms; nor in truth are the Maſters wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to let them, as they do in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
And tho the Maſters may pretend,
that if they could find ſubſtantial Tenants,
they would let their Grounds as they do in
other places; and men of ſubſtance, that
if they could have Farms upon ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
they would turn Tenants; yet we
ſee evident marks of the little probability
there is that any ſuch thing can be brought
about without a general regulation. For
in the Weſt and North Countries where
they let Land in Few (or Fee) the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
are ſo hard, that beſides the yearly
few-duty, they make the Fewer pay at his
firſt entrance the whole intrinſick value
of the Land: and the people, tho ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
men, are fools and ſlaves enough
to make ſuch Bargains. And in the
ſame Countries, when they let a ſmall
parcel of Land to a Tradeſman, they let
it not for what the Land is worth, but
what both the Land and his Trade is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61705:48"/>
worth. And indeed 'tis next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
to alter a general bad cuſtom
in any Nation, without a general regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe of inveterate bad diſpoſitions
and diſcouragements, with which the firſt
beginnings of Reformations are always
attended. Beſides, alterations that are not
countenanced by the publick Authority,
proceed ſlowly; and if they chance to
meet with any check, men ſoon return to
their former bad methods.</p>
            <p>The condition then of this Nation,
chiefly by this abuſe of racking the Lands,
is brought to ſuch extremity, as makes all
the Commonalty miſerable, and the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords,
if poſſible, the greater Slaves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can get their Rents and reduce
them into Mony. And becauſe this evil
is arriv'd to a greater height with us, than
I believe was ever known in any other
place; and that, as I have ſaid, we are
in no diſpoſition to practiſe the methods of
moſt other Countries, I think we ought
to find out ſome new one which may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
all difficulties, ſince in things of
this nature divers methods may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61705:48"/>
very practicable, and much better
than any that hitherto have bin in uſe.</p>
            <p>I know that if to a Law prohibiting all
Intereſt for Mony, another were joined,
that no man ſhould poſſeſs more Land
than ſo much as he ſhould cultivate by
Servants, the whole Mony, as well as
People of this Nation, would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
employed, either in cultivating
Lands, or in Trade and Manufactures;
That the Country would be quickly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to the greateſt height of which
the ſoil is capable, ſince it would be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by all the rich men of the Nation;
and that there would ſtill be vaſt ſtocks
remaining to be employed in Trade and
Manufactures. But to oblige a man of a
great Eſtate in Land to ſell all, except
perhaps 200 pounds Sterling a year (which
he might cultivate by his Servants) and
to employ the whole Mony produced by the
ſale of the reſt, in a thing ſo uncertain as
he would judg Trade to be, and for which
'tis like he might have no diſpoſition or
genius, being a thing impracticable: and
alſo to employ the ſmall ſtocks of Minors,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61705:49"/>
Widows, and other Women unmarried, in
Trade or Husbandry, a thing of too
great hazard for them; I would propoſe
a method for our relief, by joining to the
Law prohibiting all Intereſt of Mony,
and to the other, that no man ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
more Land than ſo much as he cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivates
by his Servants, a third Law, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
all men that poſſeſs Lands under
the value of 200 pounds Sterling clear
profits yearly, to cultivate them by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and pay yearly the half of the
clear profits to ſuch Perſons as cultivating
Land worth 200 pounds Sterling a year,
or above, ſhall buy ſuch Rents of them
at twenty years purchaſe. The Project
in its full extent may be comprehended in
theſe following Articles.</p>
            <p>All Intereſt of Mony to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
            <p>No man to poſſeſs more Land than he
cultivates by Servants.</p>
            <p>Every man cultivating Land under the
value of 200 pounds Sterling clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
a year, to pay yearly the half of the
clear profits to ſome other man who ſhall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61705:49"/>
buy that Rent at twenty years purchaſe;
and for his ſecurity ſhall be preferred to
all other Creditors.</p>
            <p>No man to buy or poſſeſs thoſe Rents,
unleſs he cultivate Land to the value at
leaſt of 200 pounds Sterling clear profits
yearly.</p>
            <p>Minors, Women unmarried, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
abſent upon a publick account, may
buy or poſſeſs ſuch Rents, tho they cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
no Lands.</p>
            <p>By the firſt Article, diſcharging all
Intereſt of Mony, moſt men who have
ſmall ſums at Intereſt, will be obliged to
employ it in Trade, or the improvement of
Land.</p>
            <p>By the ſecond, That no man is to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
more Land, than ſo much as he culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
by his Servants, the whole Land
of the Kingdom will come into the hands
of the richeſt men; at leaſt there will be
no Land cultivated by any man who is not
the poſſeſſor of it. And if he have a
greater Eſtate than what he cultivates, he
may lay out Mony upon Improvements; or
if he have bought a ſmall poſſeſſion, tho
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61705:50"/>
he may have no more Mony left, he may,
by ſelling one half of the Rent, procure
a ſum conſiderable enough, both to ſtock
and improve it. So that in a few years
the Country will be every where incloſed
and improved to the greateſt height, the
Plow being every where in the hand of the
poſſeſſor. Then Servants, Day-labourers,
Tradeſmen, and all ſorts of Merchants,
will be well paid, and the whole Commons
live plentifully, becauſe they will all be
employed by men of ſubſtance: The
Ground by incloſure, and other improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
will produce the double of what
it now dos; and the race of Horſes and
black Cattel will be much mended.</p>
            <p>By the other Articles; That no man
cultivating Land under the value of 200
pounds Sterling clear profits yearly, can
purchaſe Rents upon Land from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man; but is obliged to pay yearly
the half of the clear profits, to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as ſhall buy them at twenty years
purchaſe; and that only thoſe who culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Land worth at leaſt 200 pounds
Sterling a year, can buy ſuch Rents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61705:50"/>
The men of great Land Eſtates hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſold all their Lands, except ſo much
as may yield 200 pounds Sterling year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or ſo much above that value as they
ſhall think ſit to cultivate, may ſecure,
if they pleaſe, the whole Mony they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
for their Lands, upon thoſe Rents
which the leſſer poſſeſſors are obliged to
ſell. And ſo thoſe who had formerly
their Eſtates in Lands ill cultivated,
and Corn-rents ill paid, as well as the
other three ſorts of perſons excepted from
the general rule, and mentioned in the
laſt Article, will have a clear rent in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
coming in without trouble, for pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of which they are to be ſecured in
the Lands of the ſaid leſſer poſſeſſors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Creditors. The reaſon of except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the three ſorts of perſons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
from the general rule, is evident;
becauſe (as has bin ſaid) it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to oblige Minors, or women un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
to venture their ſmal ſtocks in
Trade or Husbandry: and much more
that thoſe who are abſent upon a publick
account, ſhould be obliged to have any ſtock
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61705:51"/>
imploy'd that way, ſince they cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
either.</p>
            <p>The ſmall poſſeſſors by this Project
are not wrong'd in any thing; for if they
are obliged to pay a Rent to others, they
receive the value of it. And this Rent
will put them in mind, not to live after
the manner of men of great Eſtates, but
as Husbandmen, which will be no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory
to their Quality, however anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
their Family may be.</p>
            <p>The method to put this Project in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
is, firſt to enact; That Intereſt for
Mony ſhould fall next year from ſix per
Cent. to five, and ſo on, falling every
year one per Cent. till it ceaſe: And to
make a Law, that all thoſe who at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
poſſeſs Lands under the value of 200
pounds Sterling clear profits yearly, ſhould
cultivate them by Servants, and ſell the
half of the clear profits at twenty years
purchaſe to the firſt Minor, woman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
or perſon abſent upon a publick
account, who ſhould offer Mony for them;
and in default of ſuch perſons preſenting
themſelves to buy, they ſhould be obliged
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61705:51"/>
to ſell ſuch Rents to any other perſons
qualified as above: and likewiſe to make
another Law, that whoever poſſeſſes Lands
at preſent to the value of 200 l. Sterling
clear profits yearly, or more, ſhould at leaſt
take ſo much of them as may amount to
that value, into their own hands. This
being done, the yearly falling of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of Mony would force ſome of thoſe
who might have Mony at Intereſt, to take
Land for it: Others calling for their
Mony, would buy eſtates of the landed
men, who are to ſell all except ſo much as
they cultivate themſelves: and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of Intereſt producing many ſmall
poſſeſſors, would afford abundance of
Rents upon Land to be bought by rich
men; of which many might probably be
paid out of thoſe very Lands they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
formerly poſſeſſed. So that all
ſorts of men would in a little time fall
into that eaſy method for their Affairs,
which is propoſed by the Project.</p>
            <p>What the half of the yearly clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of any ſmall Poſſeſſors may be, the
uſual valuation of Lands, in order to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61705:52"/>
Taxes, which becauſe of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
muſt be frequently made, will aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>But it will be ſaid, that before any ſuch
thing can every where take place in this
Nation, all Teinds (or Tithes) and all
ſorts of Superiorities, muſt be tranſacted
for, and ſold; that the Tenures of all
Lands muſt be made allodial, to the end
that every man may be upon an equal foot
with another; that this Project, in order
to its execution, dos ſuppoſe things, which
tho perhaps they would be great bleſſings to
the Nation upon many accounts, and in
particular by taking away the Seeds of
moſt Law-ſuits, and the obſtructions to all
ſorts of Improvements; yet are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as great and conſiderable as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Indeed I muſt acknowledg, that any thing
calculated for a good end is (ſince we muſt
expreſs it ſo) almoſt always clogged with
things of the ſame nature: For as all bad,
ſo all good things are chained together, and
do ſupport one another. But that there is
any difficulty, to a Legiſlative Power (that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61705:52"/>
is willing to do good) of putting either this
Project, or the things laſt named in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
I believe no man can ſhow. Sure
I am, that it never was nor can be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of any Prince or Commonwealth,
that any ſubject ſhould in any manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon another ſubject: And that it is
the Intereſt of all good Governments at
leaſt to encourage a good ſort of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</p>
            <p>I know theſe Propoſals, by ſome men who
aim at nothing but private Intereſt, will be
looked upon as viſionary: it is enough for
me, that in themſelves, and with regard to
the nature of the things, they are practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but if on account of the indiſpoſition
of ſuch men to receive them, they be
thought impracticable, it is not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
ſtrange; ſince if that indiſpoſition
ought only to be conſidered, every thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to a good end is ſuch.</p>
            <p>Many other Propoſals might be made
to the Parliament for the good of this
Nation, where every thing is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
and the publick Good ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
Amongst other things, to remove
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61705:53"/>
the preſent Seat of the Government, might
deſerve their conſideration: For as the
happy ſituation of London has bin the
principal cauſe of the Glory and Riches of
England, ſo the bad ſituation of Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh
has bin one great occaſion of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
and uncleanlineſs in which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of the people of Scotland live.</p>
            <p>A Propoſal likewiſe for the better edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of our Youth would be very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:
and I muſt confeſs I know no part of
the world where education is upon any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
foot. But perhaps I have preſumed
too much in offering my opinion upon ſuch
conſiderable matters as thoſe which I have
treated.</p>
            <p>Since I finiſhed the preceding Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
I am informed, that if the preſent
Parliament will not comply with the deſign
of continuing the Army, they ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be diſſolved, and a new one called.
At leaſt thoſe of the Presbyterian perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
who expect no good from a new Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
are to be frighted with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of the preſent (which has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61705:53"/>
their Church-government) and by
that means induced to uſe their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
with the Members for keeping up
the Army, and promoting the deſigns of
ill men: But I hope no Presbyterian will
ever be for evil things that good may come
of them; ſince thereby they may draw a
curſe upon themſelves inſtead of a bleſſing.
They will certainly conſider, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
which they ought to embrace, as well
upon the account of prudence, as of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and duty, is that of their Country;
and will not hearken to the inſinuations of
ill men who may abuſe them, and when
they have obtained the continuation of the
Army, endeavour to perſwade his Majeſty
and the Parliament, to alter the preſent
Government of the Church, by telling
them, that Presbyterian Government is
in its nature oppoſite to Monarchy, that
they maintain a rebellious principle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
Arms, and that a Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more ſutable and ſubſervient to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
ought to be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Now if at this time the Presbyterians
be true to the Intereſt of their Country,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61705:54"/>
all thoſe who love their Country, tho they
be not of that perſwaſion, will ſtand by
them in future Parliaments, when they
ſhall ſee that they oppoſe all things tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Arbitrary Power: But if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
and betray their Country, they will
fall unpitied. They muſt not tell me, that
their Church can never fall, ſince it is
the true Church of God. If it be the
true Church of God, it needs no crooked
Arts to ſupport it. But I hope they will
not deny that it may fall under perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which they will deſerve, if they go
along with the leaſt ill thing to maintain
it.</p>
