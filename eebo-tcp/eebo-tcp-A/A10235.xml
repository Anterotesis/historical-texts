            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The first which is called Celestiall, is defined to be a true and exact consideration, with an humble &amp; dutifull acknowledgement of God. Naturall Iustice is that which is borne with us, and every man hath in himselfe by nature; that which we call Civill, consisteth either of what our owne best condition stirrs and prompts us to doe, or what the suffrage of the people, the the consultation of the Senate; the will and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Princes, or the Authority of grave and wise men, inioynes us to kÃ©epe and observe. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall is that which propperly belongeth to the Bench, &amp; is grounded upon Statutes &amp; Lawes; instituted and made for the benefit and profit of the Common-weale, to the depression of vice, and incouragement of vertue.</p>

                     <p>I Come now to speake of those two parties proposed for my second discourse, (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many since their dayes, notorious for pyracy as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Danseter, and of our owns Nation <hi>Bishop</hi> &amp; <hi>Ward,</hi> who turned renegade, &amp; after lived amongst the Turkes, with others:) namely <hi>Purser,</hi> so commonly cald because he had bÃ©ene Purser of one of her Maiesties Ships Royall, whose name was <hi>Thomas Walton,</hi> and <hi>Clinton,</hi> who was an <unclear>apprentise</unclear> in the upper part of new <hi>Fish-street Hill,</hi> who utterly abandoning his former Trade, gave his minde onely to Sea, turned Navigator, and in severall Merchants ships, had made sundry Commodious and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous voyages, in which hÃ©e so applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the <hi>Compasse,</hi> that he was able to guid or conduct any Shippe to all the
<pb facs="tcp:20961:8"/>
parts of Christendome or further, and bring her backe againe.</p>
                     <p>These two bÃ©eing growne into familiar acquaintance, and both of them of haughty and ambitious spirits, having divers mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, they at length began to discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themselves, that in regard of their experience and skill in Navigation, what basenesse it was in them to bÃ©e no better than servants, who had both the Iudgement, and ability to command, and to bÃ©e onely Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to benefit and inrich others, whilst they in the Interim wanted themselves: They further reasoned that service was no heritage, and that in regard they had eyther of them bÃ©ene more than a prentiship to learne their Art, it was now high time to be freemen of the Sea, and set up for theteselves: This was soone concluded on, but how might bee as easily compassed, there lay the difficulty.</p>
                     <p>To take <unclear>oft</unclear> which, they often consulted together, but still when any likely proiect offered it selfe unto them, the way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it did more and more perplexe them: Insomuch that since likelihoods faild them, they would determine upon impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and rather then not to bÃ©e seen in the eye of the world resolute, they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb facs="tcp:20961:8"/>
desperate: the one alleadging that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage begun with a deliberate constancy, and continued without change, doth seldome or never faile. The other seconding it thus, that <unclear>valour</unclear> Conquers the enemy before the field be fought; and moreover, the courage of a man is seene in the resolution of his death, concluding, that thunder terrifieth Children, and threatnings feare fooles; but nothing can affright or dismay such as are of courage and resolution: to whom the former replide, that they were confident in their purpose, that the dye was already cast, and it was a meane folly for a man to feare that which hee cannot shun; and who so feareth every storme or tempest, is neither fit for to bee a Traveller or a Souldier.</p>
                     <p>Thus having one heartned and incouraged the other, as first to win gold and after to weare gold (according to the Proverbe) they made a voyage to <hi>Plimmonth,</hi> where they sounded many discontented saylers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with their purpose, drew them with much facility into their faction: And promising to themselves golden moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, who had before grazed upon barraine mole hils, they had got a gathering together of some fifty tall fellowes, every one provided with a good Musket, and aiming at a small
<pb facs="tcp:20961:9"/>
Barke, which lay then well victualed, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provided in the roade, they surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her in the night, weighed Anchor, and away they went to Sea to try a <unclear>desperate</unclear> fortune; which for the present so smiled <unclear>upon</unclear> them, that within few dayes they met with a <hi>Spanish</hi> Merchant, well laden, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently provided of Ordnance, with other sea munition, who making no shew of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and the other not minding them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the smalnesse of their Barke, they came up so close by them, that finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by reason of their lownesse of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and the talenesse of the other, to bee out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> danger of her Ordnance, they suddenly, ere the other were well aware, clapt close to her side, and every one of them having his Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ready charged, they boorded her without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great resistance; a sudden feare in the one, and a predicated resolution in the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly to their advantage.</p>
                     <p>When having siezed upon the Merchant, and the chiefest officers in the Ship, it was easie for them to command the rest at their pleasure: the first they locked close in a Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, the other they disarmed, and then <hi>Purser</hi> and <hi>Clinton</hi> went downe into the hole, to take full view of their fraight and lading, and finding it every way to answer their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:20961:9"/>
and that the shippe it selfe was very tight and serviceable to their purpose, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved amongst them selves to make her their owne, and in her to try a second fortune. Briefly, they cald for the Master and the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<figure/>
and putting them into their small barke, gave them some bisket and wine of their owne store, so much as they thought would serve to passe them into their owne Country without starving, and so hoysed sayle and left them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:20961:10"/>And now being so well accommodated with a vessell, victuall, and Ordnance; they thought themselves to be halfe Lords at the sea, for there was scarsly any sayle they met with, which (trusting to their courage and fortune) they did not thinke themselves able to incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with: and where those two meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire together, what is unpossible, not onely to be attempted, but almost compassed. The second they met with was a <hi>Turkish</hi> man of Warre, and though of no extraordinary great burthen, yet well man'd, and furnisht with all munition, necessary for a Pirate and sea-robber; the one haled the other, both were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like resolute, and neither of them willing to strike sayle, and now here was thiefe robbe thiefe; a cruell fight was begun, and the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncertaine to whom it would fall, some were slaine on both sides: but at length a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate shot from the <hi>English,</hi> split the maine sayle of the <hi>Turkish</hi> vessell, by which they were made unable to sayle, and being suddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd were ready to stand at the others mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: This put spirit in the one, and feare in the other; for fly they could not, no stand out they were not able, and to yeeld they were loath; in this detraction and demurre, came another shot from the <hi>English,</hi> and strooke the <hi>Turke</hi> betweene wind and water, which made
<pb facs="tcp:20961:10"/>
all their hearts to sinke as low as their heeles, and theirs of the adverse party, to mount as hye as from their breast unto their braines, crying aloud Saint <hi>George,</hi> and a maine for the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> and withall grapled with her, and made a bold attempt to board her soone, but small opposition was made in the entry; for their ship being by reason of the former leake redy to founder, they thought it more safe to stand to the mercy of men, than to trust to the unplacable fury of the sea: But they found small comfort in either, for the <hi>English</hi> being now Uictors, they hanged up the Captaine and prime officers of the maine yard, in regard they found them to be <hi>Infidels,</hi> with some other; the rest they kept as slaves to helpe to man both vessels, dispersing some in the one, and some into the other, because by that meanes they might have the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them: and having stopped the leake, and pumped the ship dry, they repaired their Mast, and now they were Masters and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of two sufficient and able vessels.</p>
                     <p>If they before were bold, the successe of this second victory made them insolent; and now no single shippe whom they thought they were able to over-master, could escape them unrifled and unrob'd, still changing their ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels when they could meet with any more
<pb facs="tcp:20961:11"/>
commodious for their use, and taking out of them such Marriners as they thought most able to manne them, swearing them to their owne faction; till at length they had si vs lusty and tall ships at their command, &amp; all bravely accommodated, insomuch that they had their Admirall, Uice-admirall, and reare-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, &amp;c. Some times they kept along the Coast of <hi>Spaine,</hi> sometimes they watched in the mouth of the <hi>Straights,</hi> not sparing <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Fleming, French-man, Scot, Biskaine,</hi> nay, their owne Countrimen; and still what Merchandise and commodities they robbed upon one Coast, they vended on another, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that within two or three yeares they were infinitely rich, not a Saylor amongst them of what low degree soever, but could show his <hi>Barbary</hi> Cheekens, <hi>Flemish</hi> Angels, <hi>English</hi> Rose Nobles, <hi>French</hi> Cardecues, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian</hi> Duckets, <hi>Spanish</hi> Pistolets, and peices of Eight in plenty, for the Pillage which they had got and sold.</p>

                        <p>The Pursevant hearing him speake so out of order began to grow angry, and said, I bad thee say, and still keep out: who replide againe,
<hi>And they will not come in.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And why (said the Pursevant) not as well keepe out? Is it not all one (answered the fellow)
<hi>For all the while they keepe out, you see they doe not offer to run in.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Pursevant said, How am I troubled with his Cocks-combe:
Hee ecchoed to him againe,
<hi>How am I troubled with this Cocks-combe:</hi>
But I see there is no remedy.

                     <p>Some other discourse past betwixt them, which no doubt was much more pleasing to the auditors in the action, than I can make plausible to the Readers in the relation: howsoever, this fellow was a Sayler, and thought to bee a favourite of that piraticall faction.

                     <p>I Have shewed you their lives, I come now to make a briefe expression of the manner of their surprisall and their deaths:
<pb facs="tcp:20961:19"/>
Her Maiesty being still more and more troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the complaints of their insolencies and outrages, gave a large Commission to one <hi>Captaine Borrowes,</hi> who was a Noble
<figure/>
Sea man, and at that time Reare Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of her Navy Royall, to finde out these Arch-rebels, and to bring them in at what rate soever, who being of an active braine,
<pb facs="tcp:20961:19"/>
and an ingenious disposition, knew that Pirats were sooner to bee undermined by policy than by force, and by stratagem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than strength; and knowing withall, that they were at that time inbarkt in a shippe which (for the swiftnesse of sayle) they called the <hi>Swallow,</hi> for shee was able to winde and turne any shippe, to goe on, and come off at her pleasure: Hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore provided himselfe of an Hulke, or hoy of slow sayle but great burthen, and stuffe it with able Souldiers well accomodated for that designe, with few or no Ordnance to bee seene, and so went upon his discovery; and having intelligence upon what Coast they then commonly haunted, he made thither, which happened at such a time when the Fleet was disperst upon sundry adventures; and the <hi>Swallow</hi> in which <hi>Purser</hi> and <hi>Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> were then both aboard was onely visible.</p>
                     <p>The Pirats had no sooner discovered her from a farre, but towards her they make with all spÃ©ede possible, in hope of some great purchase; and the nearer they approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched her, the more they were incouraged by reason of her great burthen, and her drone-like sayle; and comming neare unto her, they hayled her, and bid <hi>Amaine for
<pb facs="tcp:20961:20"/>
the Sea;</hi> (a phrase onely used by Pirats:) shee one the other side side seemed to make from them with what hast shee could, and made no resistance at all, but suffered the
<figure/>
Pirats to lay grapples upon her, which the Captaine (I meane <hi>Burrowes</hi>) percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, caused double grapples to bee laid upon them, and having fastned both shippes
<pb facs="tcp:20961:20"/>
so together that they could not bee sundred, he suddainely discovered an hundred men well armed, who violently entred the <hi>Swallow,</hi> (they being scarse halfe that number) and so surprised them, and brought both their ship and men to <hi>London,</hi> where they were presently sent to the <hi>Marshalsees,</hi> and there lay for some wÃ©ekes in prison.</p>
                     <figure/>
                     <p>They were Arraigned at Saint <hi>Margerets</hi> in <hi>South-warke,</hi> convicted, and condemned; and two dayes after brought by the Officers
<pb facs="tcp:20961:21"/>
out of the Marshalsees, (with a silver Oare borne before them) and conducted through <hi>South-warke</hi> over the Bridge, through <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and so to <hi>Wapping,</hi> and to the place of execution there, where they appeared as brave in habite, as bold in spirit: some of their garments they then wore, they distributed amongst their private friends who came to see them dye, that they might remember them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their deaths. Many questions were asked them concerning their Piracies, which they punctually resolved: desiring first, pardon of all men whom they had wronged, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their sinnes from God, whom they had most heinously offended: when imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one the other in their armes, it seemed they no more ioyfully lived together than they were willing to dye together: and so being at once turned off from the Ladder, it appeared to all the multitude that were then present, that they could not live more irregularly, than they dyed resolutely: and so there they hanging till from that ebbe two Tydes had overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their bodies, which were after taken downe, and committed to Christian buriall. And thus you have heard, the true relation of of the lives and deaths of the two most famous <hi>English</hi> Pirats of that age, <hi>Purser</hi> and <hi>Clinton.</hi>

                        <pb facs="tcp:20961:21"/>The chiefest and most remarkable passage in all this time, was <hi>William,</hi> Lord <hi>Somerset,</hi> Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> who sent Embassadour into <hi>France,</hi> was likewise to stand instead of her Maiesty, for baptising of the Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there; her Maiesty sent with him a Font of pure gold for that same purpose, weighing three hundred and twenty sixe ounces. At the Christning he gave the child to name <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth;</hi> and returned into <hi>England</hi> atter he and his traine had bin royally entertained. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, at his passage by sea into <hi>England,</hi> he had notice of divers sea Pirats which kept the narrow seas, did much harme and outrage, by robberies; they were so bold that they attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the robbing of the same ship the Earle of <hi>Worcester</hi> was in; where hee lost divers goods of great valew. Complaint was made by him to her Maiesty, and forthwith was there three good ships, whereof one was her Maiesties, called the <hi>Swallow,</hi> which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the Admirall, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>William Holstocke</hi> Esquire, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouller of her Maiesties ships: where hee did such good service, that he scoured the narrow Seas; and tooke and fired twenty ships, and Barkes of sundry Nations, which were all Pirats: as <hi>English, French,</hi> and <hi>Flemish;</hi> he apprehended in those vessels the number of 900
<pb facs="tcp:20961:22"/>
men of severall Nations, and sent them bound to wards <hi>Sand witch, Dover,</hi> Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> and <hi>Portsmouth;</hi> whereof three of them that were in this company, robbed the Earle of <hi>Worcester:</hi> who were all shortly after execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Ile of <hi>Wight;</hi> and some of them in other places. Also at the same time, the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>William Holstocke,</hi> did rescue and take from the abovesaid Pirats fleet, other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Ships, which were well fraughted with divers commodities, that they had newly taken, and were their prises; all which he set free both with their goods and vessels; and for the space of three yeares all was in a quiet and peaceable manner, none plundred or robbed, but a free passage was too and fro in all parts and places of the Coasts of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>One more strange accident I will relate, which our Histories and Chronicles doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for truth, which is of a terrible earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake which hapned in <hi>London,</hi> and almost generally throughout <hi>England,</hi> that caused such amazement of the people, as was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull for the time, and caused them to make their earnest prayers unto Almighty God, for their safe deliverance in such tempestuous stormes: The great Clocke bell in the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at <hi>Westminster,</hi> strucke of it selfe against the hammer with the violence of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
<pb facs="tcp:20961:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as divers clockes and bels in the City else where did the like: The Gentlemen of the Temple being at supper, ran from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and out of their Hall in a great maze; there did fall a peece of the Temple Church at that time, and divers stones from the Church of St. <hi>Pauls London:</hi> And at <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in the Sermon time, a stone fell from the roofe of the Church, and killed an Apprentise, and hurt another, so that they both dyed in the space of foure houres: Divers others were sore hurt, and much wounded with running out of the Church. Likewise in this earthquake, many Chimnies in the City were falne downe, and many houses much shaken and rent by the violence of this storme. This earthquake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in or about <hi>London</hi> not above one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an houre, and was no more felt or heard: But East-ward in <hi>Kent,</hi> and on the Sea coast, it was felt three times as long. Moreover, it is credibly told of many honest men, that five miles from <hi>Blonsdon</hi> in <hi>Wilt-shiere,</hi> a cry of hounds were heard in the aire, the selfe same day that the earthquake was; and the noyse was so great that was made, that they seemed to be three or foure score couple of hounds: whereat divers Gentlemen tooke their Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, thinking that some had bin hunting in the Chase, yet some of them that went out of
<pb facs="tcp:20961:23"/>
their houses, seeing nothing below abroad, cast up their eyes towards the skies, and there they espied in the aire five or sixe hounds perfectly; all which in a more ample and large discourse, thou maist finde in <hi>Howes</hi> Chronicle.</p>
                     <p>Divers other earthquakes hath hapned in former yeares, which for brevity sake I will omit, because I feare they will prove distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but let us all thinke of them, and be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Gods iudgements, for they are not to be slighted or cast behind us; but let us know that they bee warnings sent from God, to cause us to repent; and forsake our evill wayes.</p>
