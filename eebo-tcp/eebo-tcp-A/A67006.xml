         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the <hi>Choice</hi> of these Things, <hi>neglect not any,</hi> tho' the most <note place="margin">What things to choose, and how many of each.</note> 
                  <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>trivial;</hi> the <hi>Commonest</hi> Peble or Flint, Cockle or Oyster-shell, Grass, Moss, Fern, or Thistle, will be as <hi>useful,</hi> and as <hi>proper to be gathered</hi> and sent, as any the rarest production of the Country. Only take care to choose of each the <hi>fairest of its kind,</hi> and such as are <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>whole.</hi> As to the <hi>Number,</hi> six or eight of each sort is enough; But where so many of the same sort are not to be easily got, send one, two, or more as they can be procured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>time</hi> of making <hi>Observations</hi> none can ever be amiss; <note place="margin">All Places and Seasons afford somewhat worth the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and Collecting.</note> there being no <hi>season,</hi> nor indeed hardly any <hi>place</hi> wherein some Natural Thing or other does not present it self worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark: yea there are some things that require Observation <hi>all the Year round,</hi> as Springs, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor is there any <hi>Season</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss for the <hi>gathering</hi> Natural Things.

other presenting themselves at <hi>all times,</hi> and in Winter as well as Summer; only for Amber, Onyxes, and other Stones that lye <hi>in the Sea Cliffs:</hi> as also for the Glossopetrae, Teeth, and Shells that are <hi>there,</hi> search may be made to best purpose <hi>after Storms,</hi> because they are then chiefly beaten and <hi>washed out</hi> of those Cliffs. So likewise for the <hi>Gold Grains, Stones</hi> of all sorts, and <hi>Shells</hi> that are found upon <hi>Mountains,</hi> search ought to be made especially <hi>after Rains,</hi> because <hi>these</hi> wash of the Soil, and so discover them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It were very well that there were <hi>sent over</hi> hither some <note place="margin">Minerals: and Fossil-Shells, of all sorts, to be sent.</note> Specimens of <hi>all Natural Bodies whatever:</hi> To begin with <hi>Fossils;</hi> Let there be sent Samples of all the several <hi>Varieties</hi> of <hi>Marble, Ores of Metals, Native Minerals of all kinds,</hi> e. g. of <hi>Antimony, Sulphur, Nitre, Alum, Talck, Sparr,</hi> &amp;c. of the Metallick, Sparry, Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Nitrous, Aluminous, and other <hi>Iceycles</hi> that are found hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down in <hi>Grottoes,</hi> and the <hi>Fissures</hi> of Rocks: the <hi>Crystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi> Sparrs, Salts and Ores: <hi>common Pebles, Flints, Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi> &amp;c.

As to those <hi>Stones that resemble Cockles,</hi> or other <hi>Shells,</hi> be sure to send six or eight of each wherein there is any the least difference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells, Teeth</hi> and <hi>Bones,</hi> that are found <hi>at Land, on Hills,</hi> &amp;c. and those which are digged up out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>lye loose</hi> in Gravel, Chalk, Marle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> six or eight of each sort will be sufficient; but for those which are found lodged in <hi>Marble</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> and are not easily got out <hi>single,</hi> send <hi>pieces</hi> of the said <hi>Marble</hi> and <hi>Stone, of all sorts,</hi> with the <hi>Shells</hi> so lodged in them; choosing only to break off (for these Samples) <hi>such parts</hi> of the Stone that contain the <hi>fairest</hi> and most <hi>entire Shells,</hi> and such wherein they lye <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</hi> The same likewise for the <hi>Fern,</hi> and <hi>other Plants found in Cole, Slate,</hi> &amp;c. It were also not amiss that there were <hi>Samples</hi> sent over of the <hi>Nitre, Sal Ammoniac, Flores Sulphuris, Cinders,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101528:9"/>
and other Bodies, that are flung forth of the <hi>Vulcanoes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In order to the sending over these Stones, Minerals, Ores, Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil-Shells, <note place="margin">How to be packed up.</note> Teeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> each ought to be put up carefully in a <hi>piece of Paper</hi> (the <hi>Place</hi> where 'twas <hi>found</hi> being first noted thereon) <hi>by it self,</hi> to prevent <hi>rubbing, fretting,</hi> or <hi>breaking</hi> in <hi>Carriage:</hi> and then <hi>all put together</hi> into some <hi>Box,</hi> Trunk, or old Barrel, placing the <hi>heaviest</hi> and <hi>hardest</hi> at the <hi>Bottom.</hi> Those Minerals which are <hi>tender</hi> and easie to be broken, as also the <hi>tenderer</hi> kinds of <hi>Fossil-shells,</hi> ought to be put up carefully together in a <hi>Box</hi> that is <hi>not large,</hi> and (besides the <hi>Papers) Coton, Chaff,</hi> or <hi>Bran,</hi> put up with them, the better to secure them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As to <hi>Plants</hi> (as well those that grow at Sea, in Rivers, and <note place="margin">Plants of all sorts to be sent over: and how to gather them.</note> Lakes, as those which grow at Land) <hi>four Samples</hi> of <hi>each kind</hi> (wherever there is any difference in Colour, or Figure, of the Leaf or Flower) will be sufficient. Where the Plant is large, as in <hi>Trees, Shrubs,</hi> and the like, a <hi>fair sprig,</hi> about a <hi>foot</hi> in length, with the <hi>Flower</hi> on, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> if that be to be had, may suffice: but of the <hi>lesser Plants,</hi> such as <hi>Sea-Weeds, Grasses, Mosses, Ferns,</hi> &amp;c. take up the <hi>whole Plant,</hi> root and all. Chuse all these Samples of Plants <hi>when they are in prime,</hi> I mean in <hi>Flower, Head,</hi> or <hi>Seed,</hi> if possible; And if the <hi>lower</hi> or <hi>ground Leaves</hi> of any Plant be <hi>different</hi> from the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per leaves,</hi> take two or three of them, and put them up along with the Sample.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To <hi>preserve</hi> these Samples of Plants, put them each <hi>separately,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plants how to be dried, and preserved.</note> betwixt the leaves of some large <hi>Book,</hi> or into a Quire of brown <hi>Paper,</hi> displaying and spreading them <hi>smooth</hi> and even.

               <p n="7">7. Be pleased likewise to send Samples of <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>all kinds</hi> of Plants, even the most <hi>Wild</hi> and <hi>Common.</hi> But <hi>gather</hi> them not <note place="margin">Seeds, and Fruits, of all sorts, to be sent.</note> till they are <hi>Ripe,</hi> and then put <hi>each sort by it self</hi> in a piece of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and, along with it (if to be had) a <hi>leafe</hi> and <hi>flower</hi> of the <hi>Plant</hi> off which 'twas gathered, writing on the said Paper <hi>the Names</hi>

(if any) by which the <hi>Country people</hi> call the Plants to which they belong'd, and the <hi>Medicinal,</hi> or other <hi>uses, they</hi> make of them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Samples of such <hi>Nuts, Pods, Berries,</hi> or other <hi>Fruits,</hi> that will <hi>keep.</hi> But both these and the Seeds ought to be <hi>well dryed</hi> before they are put up, and to be afterwards <hi>kept dry.</hi> I had like to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to desire that Patterns might be sent over of all such <hi>Woods, Barks, Roots, Gumms, Rosins,</hi> Nat.

               <p n="8">8. In like manner <hi>Roots of Plants</hi> would be very acceptable. <note place="margin">Roots of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Plants may be so ordered as to grow when brought over into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> And there are many Sorts of them that, with very little trouble, might be so ordered that they would <hi>grow</hi> again when brought over, and <hi>set</hi> here, tho after a long Voyage. Particularly those which are <hi>Bulbous, Tuberous,</hi> and <hi>Fleshy;</hi> Such as the <hi>Roots of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips, of Lillies, Crocus's, Onions, Garlicks, Squills, Anaemonies, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes, Yaums,</hi> &amp;c. These, I say, and all like Roots, may be sent as easily and safely as Seeds, if taken up out of the Ground, and <hi>laid to dry</hi> till the Ships come away, and then only put in <hi>very dry</hi> Moss, Coton, or Sand.</p>
               <p>Then for all kinds of <hi>Ferns,</hi> or <hi>Brakes, Maiden-Hairs, Polypodyes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Particularly of the Fern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note> 
                  <hi>Harts-tongues</hi> &amp;c. which are indeed a very Beautiful Family of Plants, their <hi>Roots</hi> may be <hi>taken up,</hi> (to be in readiness) and laid again into the <hi>Ground,</hi> and covered there, in some shady place, till the Ships are ready to Sail; when each root need only be enclosed or wrapt up in a lump of <hi>Clay or Loame,</hi> and then put up into a Box with Moss, and so sent over. In the same manner may <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Gingers, Turmericks, Flower-de-luces,</hi> and the like be sent. As also of all sorts of <hi>Arums,</hi> or <hi>Cuckopints, Herb-Dragons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Yea the very <hi>intire Plants</hi> themselves will, several of them, <note place="margin">Some whole Plants will grow when sent over hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> keep so long that they may be securely sent over hither; and will, if Set, grow afterwards, and thrive well enough. Such as all the kinds of <hi>Aloes, Semporvives House-leeks, Prickley-Pears, Turks-Caps, Euphorbiums, Torch-thistles,</hi> or indeed any others that are of a very <hi>juicey, crass,</hi> or <hi>thick substance.</hi> These need only be <hi>hanged up in the Air,</hi> at the top of some <hi>Cabbin,</hi> to keep them from <hi>rotting,</hi> and they will come safe without any further trouble.</p>

10. For all <hi>larger Creatures,</hi> whether <hi>Beasts, Fish,</hi> or <hi>Fowl,</hi>

But for the <hi>lesser Creatures,</hi> such as <hi>small Birds,</hi> and <hi>Fishes, Lizards, Camelions, Salamanders, Serpents,</hi> and such like, they may be most of them well enough <hi>preserved by drying,</hi> especially if their Guts and <hi>Entrails</hi> be taken out. Unless you rather think fit to put some of the more <hi>rare, curious,</hi> and <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> into small <hi>Jarrs,</hi> filled with <hi>Rum, Brandy,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which will keep them extremely well; and you may safely put <hi>as many</hi> of them into the same Vessel as it will well hold without crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, filling it up afterwards with Rum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>closeing</hi> it up. Of each of these three or four will be enough.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

               </p>
               <p>The several sorts of <hi>Starr-fishes,</hi> and of those round Shells (beset with Spikes or Prickles) which are called <hi>Sea-eggs,</hi> or <hi>Sea-urchins,</hi> are <note place="margin">Star-Fishes, and Sea-urch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins.</note> all very beautiful, and deserve well to be preserved. The <hi>Starr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishes</hi> may be very easily <hi>dried,</hi> or put up into Brandy, and so sent. But the <hi>Sea-urchins</hi> are <hi>very tender and brittle,</hi> so that 'tis not so easie to preserve <hi>them,</hi> especially <hi>with their Spikes on,</hi> which 'tis greatly desirable might be done; and of all, those that are beset with the <hi>largest Spikes,</hi> are the most <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>curious,</hi> so that too <hi>great Care</hi> and Exactness cannot be bestowed in Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them. If they will not dry well, they ought to be put up, each by themselves in <hi>Vessels</hi> of <hi>Brandy, e. g. Gallypots</hi> just big enough to contain them, so that they may not <hi>shake,</hi> and be thereby dispoiled of their Prickles. But if any of them are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being dried, they may be put up <hi>(with their Spikes on)</hi> carefully with Coton in <hi>Pill-boxes</hi> that just fit them.</p>
