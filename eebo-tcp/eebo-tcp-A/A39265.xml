            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>No Necessity for a <hi>Protestant</hi> to turn <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> for Salvation.</head>
            <p>WE are all I hope thus far argeed, That <hi>sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> is the sure <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi> That to be <hi>saved,</hi> we must have the <hi>Hearts,</hi> and not content our selves with the bare <hi>Name</hi> and naked <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi> That the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> and no <hi>worldly</hi> or <hi>carnal</hi> Concern must sway and govern our whole <hi>Conversation.</hi> If we be not religious in good <hi>earnest,</hi> resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and endeavouring to honour God in <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Holy <hi>Gospel</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> it's no matter to us what <hi>Religion</hi> we profess, or to what <hi>Church</hi> we join our selves. <hi>Wickedness</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisy,</hi> through what <hi>Church</hi> soever our Way lieth, lead assuredly to <hi>Hell.</hi> A wicked <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> and a wicked <hi>Papist</hi> will in <hi>Hell</hi> be of the same <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True <hi>Christianity</hi> is none other but that which was taught at first by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and all they who <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>live</hi> according to their <hi>Doctrine</hi> shall be <hi>saved.</hi> Herein again we are all I suppose agreed. And if so, I think it very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable we should agree as well in that which I now add. It is not material to enquire whether a Man be of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to find whether or no he may be saved; but he that would satisfy himself of the possibility of <hi>Salvation</hi> in the <hi>Way</hi> wherein he now is, ought to enquire whether he <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>live</hi> according to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> taught by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> seeing they who do this are good <hi>Christians,</hi> what other <hi>Names</hi> soever Men may bestow upon them, and all that are <hi>such</hi> shall be <hi>saved.</hi> If
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54867:3"/>
therefore I may be able to satisfy my self that I <hi>believe,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> deliver'd by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> I have no reason to doubt of the <hi>Possibility</hi> of my <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the <hi>Way</hi> wherein I <hi>now</hi> am, tho it were so, that I had never heard to this day of any such Thing as a <hi>Church</hi> headed by a <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> And I am yet somewhat confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that a Man may <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>live</hi> according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and never hear of a <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> because once Men certainly did so, and yet were <hi>saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>next</hi> thing therefore that I have to do, is to enquire by what <hi>Means</hi> I may certainly know, what was the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> for by the same <hi>Means</hi> whereby this may be known, I may also know the certain <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi> If there be no such <hi>Means</hi> left us, we are all Fools in profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a <hi>Religion,</hi> the certain <hi>Doctrine</hi> whereof can by no means be known. If such <hi>Means</hi> there be, there must be some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Records</hi> safely convey'd down from <hi>their</hi> Time to <hi>ours;</hi> for by what other <hi>Means</hi> we at this distance of so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years should be certainly inform'd what they taught, is by me unconceivable. These <hi>Records</hi> then are to be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly searched into, and impartially examined, and whosoever is found to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in those <hi>Records</hi> contained, may be concluded to be in the <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such certain <hi>Records</hi> we have, even the <hi>Books</hi> of the holy <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> which (together with the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament)</hi> we call the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> In this we are all again unamimous, both <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in these <hi>Books</hi> contained is the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Divine Truth.</hi> Whence it certainly follows, that whatsoever <hi>Doctrine</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in these <hi>Books,</hi> whether it it be taught by <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Protestants,</hi> is to be <hi>rejected</hi> as none of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> It ought not therefore to satisfy me, that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Doctrine is taught
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54867:3"/>
by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or by the <hi>Church of England;</hi> for by which of them soever it be taught, if it be found contrary to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> it is by the Consent of both <hi>Churches</hi> to be <hi>rejected.</hi> Now seeing we <hi>Protestants</hi> take this <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> and it <hi>only,</hi> for the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> it is certain, that holding to this <hi>Rule,</hi> we do not <hi>err</hi> either in <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Practice:</hi> while on the other side we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sure, thot they do not <hi>err</hi> in <hi>both,</hi> who receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rule;</hi> till it appear that the other <hi>Rule</hi> which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is as <hi>true</hi> and <hi>certain as ours</hi> is acknowledged to be. <hi>Our part</hi> of the <hi>Rule,</hi> and that which indeed we take to be the <hi>whole,</hi> being granted us; all the <hi>Question</hi> is about <hi>their part</hi> of it. <hi>Ours</hi> is on all hands granted to be most <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certain, theirs</hi> alone remains disputable; and therefore I cannot yet see any reason, why I should think <hi>their</hi> Way <hi>safer</hi> than <hi>our own,</hi> except it can be <hi>safer</hi> to follow an <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> than a <hi>certain Rule,</hi> which I think no body will be so hardy as to affirm.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rule</hi> which they of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> advance against <hi>ours,</hi> is that of <hi>Tradition.</hi> I am therefore next to to consider, <hi>First,</hi> what they understand by it: And, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> what greater <hi>reason</hi> I can find to perswade me, that it is <hi>safer</hi> to trust to it, whether <hi>singly,</hi> or in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with <hi>our own,</hi> than <hi>to our own alone,</hi> which is the holy <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Tradition</hi> consists of such Doctines of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> as are supposed to have been taught either by <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or being dictated by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> were delivered by them to the <hi>Church,</hi> not in <hi>Writing,</hi> but in <hi>Word</hi> only, and so have successively been handed down from <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>Son,</hi> unto the present <hi>Age.</hi> And these are <hi>all</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> to be received with <hi>equal affection of</hi> Piety <hi>and</hi> Reverence, <hi>as the holy Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I confess, if it may appear as <hi>evidently</hi> to me that <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> left such <hi>Doctrines</hi> to the Custody of the <hi>Church,</hi> of equal <hi>necessity</hi> to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Christians, with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54867:4"/>
those that are <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>Scpipture,</hi> as it doth that they left us these which are <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and if I may be well assured, that <hi>these</hi> very <hi>Doctrines</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> now holds, and pretends to an <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>imposing</hi> upon all <hi>Christendome,</hi> are indeed the very <hi>same</hi> which were at first (as abovesaid) deliver'd to the <hi>Church,</hi> I can see no reason why I should not be bound to <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>one</hi> as firmly as the <hi>other.</hi> For seeing it is the <hi>Authority</hi> of the first <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of it, and not barely the <hi>Writings</hi> of it, that bind me to <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>Doctrine;</hi> if I can be equally assured, that as well what is <hi>unwritten</hi> as what is <hi>written,</hi> was preach'd by them, as <hi>necessary</hi> to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Mankind, I must needs also own an <hi>equal Obligation</hi> upon me to believe them <hi>all</hi> alike.</p>
            <p>But <hi>neither</hi> of these could I ever see clear'd, nor can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any hope that I shall hereafter. And seeing the <hi>proof</hi> of both lies wholly upon <hi>them,</hi> who <hi>affirm</hi> both; I cannot be obliged to <hi>believe</hi> them, till by such <hi>proof</hi> they have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced</hi> me. In the mean time, it seems enough to me, that <hi>God himself</hi> was pleas'd to signifie to the World his <hi>Will</hi> in <hi>writing,</hi> which I cannot imagine why <hi>He</hi> should do, had he not intended we should learn his <hi>Will</hi> from what is <hi>written,</hi> and not from any <hi>unwritten Tradition.</hi> And I am the more confirm'd in this Opinion by this, that he did not use <hi>this</hi> way of revealing his Mind unto Men at the <hi>first,</hi> nor till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the World had had a very long time to discern by <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> the Unfaithfulness of <hi>unwritten Tradition.</hi> So that <hi>this</hi> and some <hi>other Considerations</hi> whereupon the <hi>Papists</hi> use to ground their <hi>Arguments</hi> against both the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> seem to me very fully to evince both the one and the other; and so to leave no room at all for their <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> as any <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, seeing they, who are always preaching this <hi>Doctrine</hi> to us, That <hi>there is no</hi> Salvation <hi>for them that are not of their Communion,</hi> preach it not as a <hi>private Opinion</hi> of their own,

or of some few others in that <hi>Communion;</hi> but as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> which pretends to be no less than <hi>Infallible;</hi> it concerns me so much the more to use all possible diligence, to find out what <hi>Truth</hi> there may be in this <hi>Assertion.</hi> And that, not only because I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by discern the necessity of changing my <hi>Religion</hi> to make sure of my own <hi>future Happiness;</hi> but also, because the <hi>Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of this one <hi>Point</hi> will at once put an end (as it seems to me) to all the <hi>Disputes</hi> that are now between the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Us.</hi> If I can find it <hi>true, that no Man can be saved out of that Communion,</hi> I shall be a Fool to trouble my self with the Study of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and seeking out for my self in <hi>them</hi> a <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Heaven;</hi> when I may be sure, by stepping over the Threshold out of the <hi>one Church</hi> into the <hi>other,</hi> to meet with an <hi>Infallible Iudg,</hi> whom if I do but follow, I cannot go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss. And to dispute any longer with my self, whether I should do so or not, would but shew me fitter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than for any <hi>Church;</hi> seeing none but the <hi>maddest</hi> Man alive would <hi>dispute</hi> for <hi>Damnation.</hi> On the other side, if I shall find it <hi>false, that a Man cannot be saved out of that Communion,</hi> I must needs be convinced that the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which hath determined it for a certain <hi>Truth,</hi> hath already err'd both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and that having <hi>erred,</hi> she is not <hi>Infallible:</hi> and being not <hi>Infallible,</hi> by her own <hi>Confession</hi> cannot be that <hi>One, Holy, Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick Church,</hi> out of which there is no <hi>Salvation.</hi> So that as this <hi>Assertion</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> shall be found to be, <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false;</hi> even so will the <hi>Popish Religion</hi> appear also to be.</p>
            <p>But here I meet with a very great <hi>Difficulty</hi> in my way, as I am going to seek out the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> of this <hi>Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that however I may be able to satisfy <hi>my self,</hi> yet I shall never (for ought I can see) be able to satisfy <hi>them</hi> who are the <hi>Authors</hi> of it, any other way, than by a total <hi>Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of my own <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> too to their <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> and a <hi>blind</hi> Obedience to their <hi>Will.</hi> The <hi>Dispute</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54867:5"/>
(as is evident) is between two <hi>Churches,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> whereof challengeth to it self the big-swoln <hi>Prerogative</hi> of being the <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> of all <hi>Churches;</hi> a <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> of <hi>prescribing</hi> to the <hi>Faith</hi> of all Christians; the <hi>Right</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable <hi>Priviledg</hi> of being the <hi>Sole</hi> and <hi>Infallible Iudg</hi> of all <hi>Controversies</hi> in Religion; finally, an unquestionable <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>defining</hi> and <hi>declaring</hi> to all the World the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only Terms</hi> of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now, that this <hi>Roman-Mother</hi> and <hi>Mistress-Church,</hi> sole <hi>Commandress</hi> and <hi>Infallible Iudg,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already in the <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> determin'd it, and by her <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> imposed an <hi>Oath</hi> upon her <hi>Subjects</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, <hi>That none out of her Communion can be saved,</hi> should after all this, in pure <hi>Condescension</hi> to Men declared <hi>Hereticks,</hi> divest her self of her <hi>Authority,</hi> lay aside her <hi>Infallible Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,</hi> come down from the <hi>Tribunal</hi> and the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> and stand at the <hi>Bar</hi> submitting <hi>her self</hi> and the whole <hi>Cause</hi> to an indifferent and equal <hi>Trial,</hi> is a thing as little to be hoped for, as it is yet unagreed upon by what <hi>Law, Iury</hi> or <hi>Iudg</hi> the <hi>Controversy</hi> should be decided. And truly on the other side, it seems to me altogether as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable in her to accept, That <hi>we Protestants of the Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> tho we pretend to nothing of this <hi>Exorbitant Power</hi> over <hi>Her</hi> or other <hi>Churches,</hi> or of determining <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes</hi> for all the World, should yet, upon a naked <hi>Summons</hi> from <hi>Her,</hi> whose <hi>Authority</hi> we question, and see no reason to acknowledg, forthwith <hi>subscribe</hi> to the <hi>Sentence</hi> of our own <hi>Condemnation,</hi> without any fair and legal <hi>Process,</hi> or indeed so much as yield to a <hi>Trial,</hi> where our professed <hi>Adversaries</hi> must be at once the <hi>Law-makers, Accusers, Witnesses;</hi> and yet this is most notoriously our <hi>Case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What course now in this <hi>Case</hi> can be taken by us? The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> tells us expresly and peremptorily, <hi>We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saved out of her Communion.</hi> Must we believe her without any more ado? That's indeed the way to make a short end of all our <hi>Differences,</hi> for then we must yield to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54867:5"/>
               <hi>Her's,</hi> or else run headlong to <hi>Damnation:</hi> But if we believe her not (as for my part I know not how we can do, till we see some <hi>reason</hi> why we should do so) the <hi>Dispute</hi> (for ought I can see) is like to be <hi>endless.</hi> For no such <hi>reasons</hi> can, or ought she to give us, if she will be constant to <hi>her self,</hi> and stand to her own <hi>Principles,</hi> (as will plainly appear anon) and if she desert her own <hi>Principles,</hi> she must yield her self to be <hi>fallible,</hi> and not the <hi>true Church;</hi> and then in vain is all talk of <hi>Reasons,</hi> why they that are not of her <hi>Communion</hi> should be <hi>damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, suppose it be pretended (as indeed it is) that we have had sufficient <hi>Reasons</hi> given us, why we ought to believe her in this Point. This then is the present <hi>Question</hi> between us, Whether she hath given us <hi>sufficient reason</hi> for this, or no. <hi>She</hi> confidently <hi>affirms</hi> it, <hi>We</hi> as confidently <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> it. <hi>She</hi> calls us <hi>obstinate Hereticks</hi> for denying it, and lays many a heavy <hi>Curse</hi> upon us: We for this think her a very <hi>unreasonable</hi> and <hi>imperious Mistress,</hi> usurping an <hi>Authority</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, which <hi>God</hi> never gave her. Who I wonder shall now be thought fit to decide this <hi>Dispute? She</hi> will be <hi>tried</hi> and <hi>judg'd</hi> by no other but <hi>her self;</hi> for <hi>She</hi> is resolv'd to be <hi>Sole</hi> and <hi>Infallible Iudg</hi> in all <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> That is in plain terms, She will <hi>accuse</hi> us, and she will leave us no room for our own <hi>Defence;</hi> She will <hi>condemn</hi> us, and she will not permit us to question the <hi>Iustice</hi> of her <hi>Sentence.</hi> She tells us, we are bound to <hi>believe</hi> her, and <hi>obey</hi> her, or else we must die eternally for it. We desire some <hi>reason</hi> may be brought to <hi>convince</hi> us of this Duty: and she tells us again, she is our <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Infallible Mistress,</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Iudg;</hi> and so the <hi>Conclusion</hi> is, We must believe she hath this <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> because she is <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>Infallible;</hi> which we can yet see no reason to believe, and therefore cannot believe; and because we cannot believe it, we are declared to be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and in a State of <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

Seeing then, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> will by no means recede from her <hi>Claim</hi> to this <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Infallibility;</hi> it seems plain to me, that there is no possibility of satisfying <hi>her</hi> any way whatsoever but by <hi>yielding</hi> my self up intirely to her without any farther <hi>dispute.</hi> But because I cannot do this, without violence to my <hi>Conscience,</hi> and incurring that very <hi>Damnation,</hi> which she would persuade me thereby to prevent; I must of necessity leave her a while to satisfy her self about the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as she can; whilst I for my own private <hi>Satisfaction</hi> take into a very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Consideration</hi> these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>

               <p>The <hi>first</hi> thing I am to inquire into, is, <hi>What good ground of hope I can discern that I may be</hi> saved <hi>as I am a</hi> Protestant.

               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54867:6"/>
By a <hi>Protestant</hi> I understand no other but a <hi>Christian,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering firmly both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> to the <hi>written Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>protesting</hi> against both the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and all others whatsoever, so far only, as they are either <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> in any thing, or <hi>ungrounded</hi> on the same in things pretended by them <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Such <hi>Protestants</hi> do we of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> profess our selves to be, as is apparent unto all, from the 6<hi>th</hi> of our XXXIX <hi>Articles,</hi> affirming, <hi>That the</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>contain all things necessary to</hi> Salvation; <hi>so that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not</hi> read <hi>therein, nor may be</hi> proved <hi>thereby, is not to be required of any Man, that it should be believed as an</hi> Article <hi>of</hi> Faith, <hi>or be thought requisite or necessary to</hi> Salvation.</p>
               <p>This is our very <hi>first Principle,</hi> as we are called <hi>Protestants,</hi> and such an one I do heartily profess my self; neither see I yet the least cause to doubt of my <hi>Salvation,</hi> whilst by the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> I live answerably to this <hi>Profession.</hi> For that the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> built upon this <hi>Principle</hi> is a <hi>safe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> is I think altogether as plain, as that <hi>Christianity</hi> it self, <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unmix'd,</hi> is the <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Salvation;</hi> because 'tis plain, that this <hi>Religion</hi> we profess, holding to this <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> can be nothing else but <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unmix'd Christianity,</hi> being that, and no other, which is contained in the Holy <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is then the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> the <hi>Word of God</hi> or not?

when diligently consulted, will be best able to inform us.

               </p>
               <p>I find in the <hi>first</hi> place, that <hi>God himself</hi> writ the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> the compleat <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> with <hi>his own Finger,</hi> Exod. 31. 1, 18.

And that the <hi>King</hi> was to have by him a <hi>Copy</hi> of it for his Direction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18. I find many <hi>Curses</hi> denounced against the Breakers of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 58. and <hi>Blessings</hi> promised to them that keep it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 10. I find it was expresly forbidden to <hi>add unto it,</hi> or <hi>to aiminish from it,</hi> Deut. 4. 2, 12, 32. <hi>To turn from it to the right-hand or to the left,</hi> Josh. 1. 7. And that the good <hi>Kings</hi> were careful to order all things according to it, and to <hi>reform</hi> what had been amiss by it, 1 <hi>Chron. 16. 40. 2 Kings</hi> 22. 13. And therefore I do not wonder to hear the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> saying, <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul,</hi> Psal. 19. 7. nor to find <hi>Isaiah</hi> sending Men <hi>to the Law, and to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> saying, <hi>If any speak not according to this Word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no Light in them,</hi> Isa. 8. 20.</p>
               <p>Again, I find our <hi>Blessed Saviour himself,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> after him, very frequently <hi>appealing</hi> and <hi>referring</hi> their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to that which had been <hi>written</hi> in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and in the <hi>Prophets.

the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed,</hi> Luk. 1. 4. <hi>The things which are most surely believed among us,</hi> v. 1. <hi>all things of which himself had perfect understanding from the very first,</hi> v. 3.

And finally I find St. <hi>Paul</hi> asserting the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> as <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi> as any Man can speak, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. saying, That <hi>the Holy Scripture is able to make a Man wise unto Salvation through Faith which is in Christ Iesus.</hi> That <hi>all Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for Instruction in Righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good Works.</hi> Now what more can we desire, than <hi>to be made wise unto Salvation?</hi> And we are here plainly told, that <hi>the holy Scripture is able</hi> to make us so. What more can be needful to direct us in the Way to <hi>Salvation,</hi> than what we may learn from the <hi>Scriptare?</hi> It is <hi>profitable</hi> for our <hi>Information</hi> and <hi>Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi> for the <hi>Confutation</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Heresy,</hi> for the <hi>Correction</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Wickedness,</hi> for our <hi>Instruction</hi> in <hi>Righteousness.</hi> It is so <hi>profitable</hi> for all these purposes, that thereby <hi>the Man of God,</hi> the <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Teacher</hi> may be made <hi>compleat,</hi> and well <hi>furnish'd</hi> for all the branches of his <hi>Office,</hi> all the <hi>works</hi> of his <hi>holy Calling.</hi> In short, it is <hi>able</hi> to bring us to <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ Iesus;</hi> And <hi>whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting Life;</hi> Joh. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Furthermore; from the same <hi>Scripture</hi> I also learn, that <hi>Unwritten</hi> or <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> hath ever been found too <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> a thing to be <hi>relied</hi> on for so great a matter as <hi>Salvation.</hi> I find that before the <hi>Flood,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>long Lives</hi> of Men, the <hi>few Principles</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> and the <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi> of <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>remembring</hi> things so agreeable to <hi>humane</hi>

Nature, yet <hi>all Flesh</hi> had soon <hi>corrupted his Way upon the Earth,</hi> Gen. 6. 12. and <hi>every Imagination of the Thoughts of Man's Heart was only evil continually,</hi> v. 5. And after the <hi>Flood,</hi> the whole World was quickly over-run with <hi>Idolatry:</hi> So ill was the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which had been preach'd by <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Sons,</hi> preserved by <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> Nay, I find, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>God</hi> was pleas'd to give the <hi>Iews</hi> his <hi>Will</hi> in <hi>Writing,</hi> their <hi>Teachers</hi> had so corrupted the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>God</hi> with their <hi>Traditions,</hi> that it was a great part of our <hi>blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's</hi> business, to rescue it from those <hi>Traditional</hi> Corruptions.

And St. <hi>Paul</hi> warns the <hi>Colossians</hi> to <hi>beware of being deceived through Philosophy and vain Deceit, after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after Christ,</hi> Col. 2. 6. And the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>writing</hi> most of the <hi>Epistles,</hi> yea and the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels</hi> too, seems to be the <hi>Danger</hi> that Christians were in of being <hi>seduced</hi> by <hi>false Teachers,</hi> from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> under the pretence of <hi>Tradition.</hi> Such were the <hi>Wolves in Sheeps cloathing,</hi> Mat. 7. 15 <hi>False Apostles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Workers, transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 13.

               <p>From what I find in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> I must needs conclude, till I be better inform'd, that it is a <hi>sufficient Rule</hi> for us to go by; and that, so long as we hold us to <hi>it alone,</hi> in our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> there can be no necessity of resorting to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome, for that unto which</hi> our <hi>Bibles</hi> at home can direct us.

us wise unto Salvation,</hi> saith the <hi>this Infallible Scripture;</hi> and we take no other but this <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Infallible Scripture</hi> for the <hi>Rule</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religious Practice,</hi> say we <hi>Protestants.</hi> What now should hinder me to infer from hence, that if the <hi>Scripture</hi> be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> we <hi>Protestants</hi> are very well as we are; for we have the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Infallible God,</hi> and if it may stand us in any stead, the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Infallible Church</hi> (as she will needs be accounted) to assure us, that adhering to the holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> we are in the <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>sure way</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farther yet, as I am a <hi>Protestant</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I do declare in the words of our VIIIth Article, <hi>That the three Creeds,</hi> Nice <hi>Creed,</hi> Athanasius <hi>Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles Creed, ought throughly to be received and believ'd; for they may be proved by most certain Warrants of Holy Scripture.</hi> Seeing then, we receive and throughly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the same <hi>Creeds,</hi> and no other, which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> her self professeth to believe; and which were thought by the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> for above 400 Years after the first planting of <hi>Christianity,</hi> to contain all <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> necessary for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Christians;</hi> I think I have hence gather'd this farther Confirmation of my <hi>Assurance,</hi> that we <hi>Protestants</hi> are in the direct <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>Salvation;</hi> that we are of the very same <hi>Religion,</hi> and no other, in all the <hi>necessary</hi> Points of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> whereof the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently was in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> Ages of it. In the <hi>four first General Councils</hi> no other <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> were held needful to be believed by Christians, but those of these <hi>Creeds,</hi> which we entirely own and believe. Either then it is true, That these <hi>three Creeds</hi> contain all <hi>necessary</hi> Points of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> or it is not. If it be <hi>true,</hi> we are <hi>safe</hi> enough, and can with no colour of <hi>Reason</hi> be said to <hi>err</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> or to deserve the Name of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> If it be not <hi>true,</hi> then were all those <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> as much <hi>Hereticks</hi> as <hi>we</hi> are, and knew no more, than we do, what belong'd to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54867:9"/>
Christians. And strangely <hi>partial</hi> is the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in approving the <hi>Faith</hi> of those <hi>Councils,</hi> which one of their most famous <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> is said to have reverenced as the <hi>four Gospels,</hi> and yet to condemn ours, tho in all Points the very same. Especially when the <hi>Third</hi> of those <hi>Councils,</hi> held at <hi>Ephesus</hi> in the Time of Pope <hi>Celestine,</hi> did expresly decree, <hi>That it should not be lawful to utter, write, or compose any other Faith, besides that which had been defined by the Holy Fathers congregated in the Holy Ghost in the City of</hi> Nice. Ordering, that all they should be <hi>punish'd, who tender'd any other to such as had a desire to be converted to the Knowledg of the Truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were</hi> Gentiles, Jews, <hi>or of any other</hi> Heresy. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by 'tis plain, that the <hi>Fathers</hi> in this <hi>third Council</hi> did conclude that <hi>Creed</hi> to comprehend the <hi>entire Faith</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> And indeed a Man would think that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> had in the Beginning of it been altogether of the same mind, when of the same <hi>Creed</hi> it thus declared it self; <hi>That it is that Principle wherein all that profess the Faith of Christ do necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree, and the Firm and Onely Foundation against which the Gates of Hell shall not prevail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may, I think, upon these <hi>Considerations,</hi> without more ado, be very well satisfied of the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> themselves must grant, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>practise,</hi> as of necessity to <hi>Salvation,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is so; and therefore, that we do not <hi>err</hi> either in our <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> whilst we live according to our own <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> For if we <hi>err</hi> in <hi>either,</hi> so far do <hi>they err</hi> also; and not <hi>they</hi> only, but <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Christian World.</hi> And here we may press them with their own <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Arguing,</hi> and to much more purpose, than they are wont to use it against us. When they would convince us that their <hi>Religion</hi> is the <hi>safer,</hi> they are wont thus to argue; <hi>That Religion is the</hi> safer, <hi>wherein, by the Confession of both Sides, a Man may be saved: but both Sides confess, that a Man may be saved in the Popish Religion, and both Sides do not confess that a Man may be saved in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54867:9"/>
Protestant Religion: therefore the Popish Religion is the safer.</hi> Supposing now this way of arguing for the <hi>Safety</hi> of their <hi>Religion</hi> from the <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>both Parties</hi> be of any strength, as they must suppose it to be, who so often and confidently use it; then must the like <hi>Argument</hi> from the same <hi>Medium,</hi> be altogether as strong for us. I would only beg of them to grant me <hi>this,</hi> (and I hope they will not say my Request is unreasonable) That <hi>that Religion is the safest, all the Doctrines whereof are the truest.</hi> If they will not grant me this, they must grant it <hi>safer</hi> to hold <hi>some false Doctrines</hi> than <hi>all true.</hi> But if they think this absurd, then must they give me leave thus to argue; <hi>That Religion is the safest, wherein all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines held or taught, as necessary to Salvation, are, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of both Sides, certainly true. Now both Sides confess, that all Doctrines, held or taught in the Protestant Religion, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true; and both Sides do not confess, that all Doctrines held and taught in the Popish Religion are certainly true: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Protestant Religion is the safer.</hi> The same <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> the same <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> the same <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>religious Worship,</hi> the same <hi>holy Sacraments,</hi> the same <hi>holy Orders</hi> of <hi>Ministers,</hi> which <hi>we</hi> have; the very same have <hi>they</hi> also. But <hi>they</hi> have many things of all these sorts, which <hi>we</hi> have not; no nor any other <hi>Christians,</hi> but those of their own <hi>Communion.</hi> And therefore to strengthen my <hi>Argument,</hi> yet more I say, <hi>If that</hi> Doctrine <hi>and</hi> Practice <hi>be the</hi> safest, <hi>wherein all good</hi> Christians <hi>agree; we are sure that ours is the</hi> safest, <hi>because all good</hi> Christians <hi>do agree in them; and that theirs is not safe, because all good</hi> Christians <hi>do not agree in them.</hi> Nay let me add this more: Our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is either <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> in all things pretended by us <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Salvation;</hi> or there is no such thing as a <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>true Christian Religion</hi> in the World <hi>visibly professed;</hi> and if so, it will follow, that <hi>Christ</hi> hath no true <hi>visible Church</hi> upon Earth, which I am confident no <hi>Papist</hi> will say. The Consequence is plain, because all <hi>Christians</hi> all the World
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54867:10"/>
over, that make any <hi>Figure</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> hold the same both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> with us, in what we account <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> it self not excluded.</p>
               <p>Tho it be very certain, that we <hi>positively</hi> and <hi>affirmatively</hi> hold nothing in <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> as necessary to <hi>Salvation,</hi> but what is held by the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> her self, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Christian Churches;</hi> yet will not the Men of that <hi>Church</hi> allow us any <hi>possibility</hi> of being <hi>saved,</hi> whilst we are <hi>Protestants.</hi> And he, who of late hath been at some Pains to <hi>represent</hi> the <hi>Papist</hi> to us in his <hi>fairest Dress,</hi> hath labour'd as hard in this <hi>Point,</hi> as in any other, to shew that his <hi>Church</hi> is not <hi>uncharitable</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> She delivers concerning our <hi>desperate Estate.</hi> Now although I am not enquiring, whether <hi>this Doctrine</hi> be <hi>charitable</hi> or <hi>uncharitable,</hi> but only whether it be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false;</hi> yet, for my better Satisfaction, I will examine all that he saith to this purpose.</p>
               <p>He tells us, His <hi>Church doth nothing herein but what she hath learn'd of</hi> Christ <hi>and his</hi> Apostles. And if he can shew me this, I must needs be fully satisfied, being verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded they never taught any thing <hi>uncharitable</hi> or <hi>untrue.</hi> To shew this, he tells us, how Christ, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. hath said, <hi>He that believeth and is baptised, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned. And this is all his Church delivers in this Point.</hi> If this be <hi>all</hi> She delivers, we cannot call her <hi>uncharitable</hi> for it, for we our selves willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to this Sentence of our <hi>Blessed Saviour.</hi> Only we think, he did not here <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>authorise</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to say, That all who are not of her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> shall be <hi>damn'd;</hi> tho she knows they believe all that <hi>Christ</hi> sent his <hi>Apostles</hi> to teach them. I do not find in the <hi>Roman Ritual,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Baptising</hi> either of <hi>Infants</hi> or <hi>adult</hi> Persons, uses or requires any other <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> but that only of the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> which is the same we use; and if to <hi>beleive</hi> and be <hi>baptised</hi> in this <hi>Faith,</hi> be enough for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Papists,</hi> why is it not enough
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54867:10"/>
also for <hi>Protestants?</hi> And if the <hi>Additional Articles</hi> of the <hi>Trentine Faith,</hi> and P. <hi>Pius</hi> his <hi>Creed</hi> be <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> why is there no mention made of them in the <hi>Roman</hi> Order of <hi>Baptism?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He adds that of St. <hi>Paul, (1 Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.) where <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of some who in later times would come and preach a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from Meats, which God hath created to be received; he brands them with the infamous Title, of Men that depart from the Faith; giving heed to seducing Spirits, and Doctrines of Devils.</hi> And several other Places of <hi>Scripture</hi> he then produceth, to shew that <hi>Hereticks,</hi> such as they <hi>that affirmed the</hi> Resurrection <hi>to be past already, or denied that</hi> Jesus <hi>is the</hi> Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in a State of <hi>Condemnation.</hi> Other Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> he brings, wherein <hi>Christians</hi> are charged to be <hi>unanimous,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for causing <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> warn'd to maintain <hi>Unity,</hi> and not to hearken to <hi>false Teachers</hi> and <hi>Seducers, &amp;c.</hi> But I find not by all this, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> or any of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> taught the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which both <hi>forbids to marry,</hi> and commands to <hi>abstain from Meats allow'd of God;</hi> which teacheth divers <hi>Doctrines,</hi> whereof we find not any thing in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to condemn those for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that adhere wholly to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> or for <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> who hold <hi>Communion</hi> with all <hi>Christians,</hi> so far as they keep to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi> from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> no farther, than in those Points only wherein they cannot hold her <hi>Communion</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> too. I do not see, but after the same rate, as he here defends the <hi>Charity</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> he might also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her <hi>Iustice,</hi> if She should pretend, that because <hi>Christ</hi> commanded his <hi>Disciples</hi> to fetch him another Man's <hi>Ass</hi> and her <hi>Colt;</hi> She did but what he taught, in taking away other Mens Goods, and giving no other reason for it but this, that she hath <hi>need</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:54867:11"/>
What the <hi>Papists</hi> say more, to shew that we can have no <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> is one of these <hi>two</hi> things. Either, <hi>first,</hi> That it is not an <hi>entire Faith,</hi> there being (as they say) many <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Articles</hi> which we believe not: Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is no <hi>right-grounded Faith,</hi> seeing it is not built upon suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Authority,</hi> that is to say, on the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>first Objection</hi> to the <hi>Protestant Faith</hi> is this, That it is no <hi>entire Faith.</hi> And here I am told by the <hi>Representer, There is no more hopes for one that denies obstinately any one Point of Catholick Faith, tho he believes all the rest; than there is for one that keeps Nine of the Commandments, with the Breach of the Tenth.</hi> Now this seems to me no great Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to change the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for that of <hi>Rome,</hi> if an <hi>entire Faith</hi> and an <hi>entire Obedience</hi> be but <hi>equally necessary.</hi> I wish with all my Heart I could be as sure, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not break the <hi>first Commandment,</hi> by her <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Host;</hi> and the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> in her <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> and the <hi>Cross;</hi> as I am sure, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> neither <hi>obstinately denies</hi> any <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Faith;</hi> nor <hi>countenanceth</hi> the Breach of any <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> as that Church seems too much to do, whilst she takes no little Care, that the <hi>People</hi> may not know them <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We stedfastly believe the whole <hi>Scripture,</hi> so far as we are able to understand it <hi>explicitly;</hi> and when we do not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly,</hi> we receive the <hi>three Creeds,</hi> which have ever been thought to contain the <hi>entire Faith</hi> of a Christian: wherein then is our <hi>Faith partial</hi> or <hi>defective?</hi> I must consider that anon: at present, seeing <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> according to our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</hi> is a necessary ingredient of an <hi>Heretick;</hi> I can easily assure <hi>my self,</hi> tho I do not see how 'tis possible for me to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy <hi>them,</hi> that I am no <hi>Heretick;</hi> for I certainly know, that I am very desirous to be throughly inform'd, and to be brought to a right understanding of all necessary <hi>Truths;</hi> and am still
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54867:11"/>
in a readiness, and full preparation of Mind, to believe any <hi>one</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of their <hi>Articles,</hi> whensoever they shall please to prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of them, either by <hi>Scripture,</hi> or by unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable <hi>Apostolical Tradition.</hi> I am sure therefore, I deny not <hi>obstinately</hi> any one Point of <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> But till they vouchsafe me the proof I desire, I must content my self with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is <hi>able to make wise unto Salvation through Faith which is in Christ Iesus,</hi> and not in the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet I find, that it is for <hi>this</hi> especially, that we are call'd <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that we <hi>adhere only</hi> to the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and that they often explain their meaning, in bestowing that <hi>Title</hi> on us, by calling us <hi>Scripturists</hi> and <hi>Gospellers;</hi> and ridicule us for talking of <hi>only Scripture.</hi> But when I consider, that this is the <hi>Fundamental Heresy</hi> wherewith we are charged, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but a little wonder at it; and find less cause than ever, to think we can be <hi>Hereticks</hi> indeed, or that they can call us so any otherwise than in jest. Can they grant the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> to be <hi>the Power of</hi> God <hi>unto Salvation;</hi> and yet in <hi>earnest</hi> call us <hi>Hereticks</hi> for being <hi>Scripturists</hi> and <hi>Gospellers?</hi> If, submitting our <hi>Faith</hi> in all things to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we can be <hi>Hereticks;</hi> then must the <hi>Scripture</hi> teach <hi>Heresy,</hi> and cannot be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> What a <hi>Contradiction</hi> is this in <hi>Papists,</hi> to call us <hi>Scripturists</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> which is in effect to say, That we adhere on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Infallible Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and yet are guilty of <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Error</hi> in the <hi>Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is it then wherein our Faith is defective? It is in this, that we do not believe <hi>all</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to be believed. This indeed would make us <hi>Papists,</hi> but whether it would make us better <hi>Christians</hi> than we are already, is not so certain. <hi>A</hi> Papist (saith the <hi>Representer) is one that lives and believes what is prescribed in the Council of</hi> Trent. But this <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Papists Faith</hi> came into the World (as we think) too late, almost by <hi>fifteen hundred</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:54867:12"/>
Years, to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> and therefore he could not have <hi>represented</hi> his <hi>Religion</hi> to us with greater disadvantage than here he doth. We cannot conceive how so small a handful of <hi>Prelats,</hi> most of them <hi>Italians,</hi> sworn <hi>Vassals</hi> to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> assembled together at <hi>Trent fifteen hundred</hi> Years after <hi>Christ</hi>'s preaching, and wholly <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> in all their proceedings by the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> whose <hi>Authority</hi> was the <hi>principal</hi> thing in <hi>question,</hi> and submitting all at last to <hi>Him alone,</hi> should come by that immense <hi>Authority,</hi> to command the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Christian World,</hi> or what <hi>Commission</hi> they could shew from <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Supream Lawgiver,</hi> to prescribe <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> to all <hi>Christendom.</hi> And we can as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how this pretended <hi>Council,</hi> could at once <hi>confirm</hi> all the <hi>General Councils,</hi> and among the rest, that of <hi>Ephesus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd; yea, and declare the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> to be the <hi>firm and only Foundation,</hi> and yet contrary to the <hi>Decree</hi> of that <hi>Ephesine Council,</hi> and not very consistently to it's own <hi>Declaration,</hi> decree so many more <hi>Points,</hi> than that <hi>Creed</hi> contains, as <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed. Moreover, if this be the great <hi>Oracle</hi> we must consult, as our surest <hi>Guide</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; where must we meet with him, that can give us the certain <hi>Sense</hi> of its <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Ambiguous Responses?</hi> The learnedst of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> are not yet well agreed about it; and if the <hi>English Representer,</hi> or <hi>French Expounder</hi> have had the luck to hit it, I am sure, that many heretofore, who thought themselves as <hi>wise</hi> as <hi>either</hi> of them, have strangely miss'd it: Or else that <hi>Council,</hi> and the <hi>Religion</hi> call'd <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> hath several <hi>Faces</hi> for several <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Countries,</hi> and in one <hi>place</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> shall look like <hi>it self,</hi> and in another shall be made to look as like the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> as the <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Painter</hi> dares make it. But that which here put us to a stand in this, That as the <hi>Pope</hi> at first taught that <hi>Council</hi> to speak; so hath he reserved the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of its <hi>Decrees</hi> to the <hi>See Apostolick,</hi> or himself only; and <hi>He</hi> is not always
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54867:12"/>
pleas'd in plain terms to let us know his Mind; and if he should, for once, speak out plainly, it will be a little hard for him to assure us, that none of his <hi>Successors</hi> shall hereafter <hi>contradict</hi> him; unless he can satisfy us, that he has as well the Gift of <hi>Prophesying,</hi> as that of <hi>defining</hi> and <hi>interpreting.</hi>

               <p>However, it is for <hi>not believing</hi> the <hi>new Articles</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> that we are accounted <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and out of the <hi>way</hi> to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And the <hi>reason</hi> is, because these <hi>Articles</hi> are supposed to be as firmly grounded on the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as any of those <hi>old ones</hi> which we believe: For the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (saith the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent)</hi> is <hi>partly</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>partly</hi> in <hi>Traditions unwritten; these are to be received with the same affection of Piety and Reverence;</hi> and therefore he that disbelieves any <hi>Article</hi> grounded upon <hi>unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is no less a <hi>Heretick,</hi> than he that disbelieves what is <hi>written</hi> in the Books of <hi>Scripture.</hi> If I knew how to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied concerning the <hi>Authority</hi> of this <hi>Council,</hi> I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily tell what <hi>Credit</hi> I should give to this, which it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirms. But so long as I cannot discern the <hi>reason</hi> of it's pretended <hi>Authority,</hi> I am a little apt to suspect, that it was not the <hi>clearness</hi> of this <hi>Principle</hi> that moved it to make so many either <hi>unscriptural</hi> or <hi>antiscriptural Decrees;</hi> but rather the desire it had of vindicating its <hi>unscriptural Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> that made it necessary to espouse such a <hi>Principle.</hi> And indeed when I well consider it, I am not a little comforted by it; that this <hi>equalling unwritten Tradition</hi> with <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is the very <hi>Basis</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Religion,</hi> is one of the most <hi>incredible</hi> things in the World of <hi>it self,</hi> and as <hi>destitute</hi> of any tolerable <hi>Evidence,</hi> whence it may gain any <hi>Credit</hi> to it self. It must needs seem very strange to any considering Man, That the <hi>wise God</hi> should leave us a <hi>Rule</hi> in <hi>writing,</hi> on purpose to direct us how to <hi>honour Him,</hi> and attain to <hi>Salvation;</hi> and give it this <hi>Commendation,</hi> that <hi>it is able to make wise unto Salvation;</hi> and yet omit a great many things altogether as <hi>necessary</hi> to

those ends, as those that are <hi>written;</hi> and without the Belief and Practice whereof, those that are <hi>written</hi> can no whit avail us; and yet never so much as once tell us in all that <hi>Writing,</hi> whither we should go to seek and learn them: Nay, that he should omit therein the <hi>principal Point</hi> of all, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all that is either <hi>written</hi> or <hi>unwritten</hi> can signify nothing, that is, to tell us, That the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is the <hi>only true Church,</hi> the <hi>only sure</hi> and <hi>Infallible Interpreter</hi> of all that is <hi>written;</hi> and the <hi>only faithful Keeper</hi> of all that is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written;</hi> from the <hi>Mouth</hi> whereof we must receive all <hi>saving Truth.</hi> This I think is a thing that must needs be very hard for any one to believe, that believes the <hi>Infinite Wisdom, Goodness</hi> and <hi>Veracity</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And how it can ever be made <hi>evident,</hi> that there are such <hi>necessary unwritten Traditions,</hi> or that <hi>these,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> holds, are <hi>they;</hi> I think no Man living can imagine. I am sure if the <hi>Papists</hi> way of reasoning be good, it's <hi>safer</hi> not to believe this. For all Sides consent, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> which we have is the certain <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> but all Sides are not agreed, that <hi>unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> are the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> therefore it is <hi>safer</hi> to believe the <hi>Scripture</hi> only to be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and not <hi>Traditions.</hi> We hold us to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> grant that to be the <hi>safest Rule;</hi> their greatest strength lies in <hi>unwritten,</hi> or (as they are wont to speak) <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Traditions;</hi> which in plain <hi>English,</hi> is no more but <hi>Report</hi> and <hi>Custom;</hi> and whether there can reasonably be thought any <hi>certainty</hi> in these, equal to <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>written Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> given by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspiration,</hi> can be no hard matter for a very weak Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to determine.</p>
               <p>That which makes these <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> of the less Credit with me, is the assurance I have, that a <hi>pretence</hi> to them, and a vain <hi>confidence</hi> in them, hath produced much <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Division</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> 'Tis well known, how <hi>far,</hi> and how <hi>long</hi> the <hi>Errors</hi> of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to <hi>Infants</hi> (to mention no more) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd

                  <hi>Truth could not be found out by them who understood not Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because it was not deliver'd by Writing, but by living Voice; for which cause also St.</hi> Paul <hi>said, we speak Wisdom among them that are perfect.</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 97th <hi>Tract</hi> upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> saith, <hi>that all the most foolish Hereticks, who desire to be accounted Christians, used to colour their audacious Fictions with a pretence from that Sentence of the Gospel,</hi> Joh. 16. 10. <hi>I have many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.</hi> Thus did the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of old both plead <hi>Tradition,</hi> and sought to strengthen their Plea by such places of <hi>Scripture</hi> as these; which are the very same, that the <hi>Papists</hi> produce to the same purpose, as may be seen in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>But I find that the <hi>Orthodox Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were of another Mind. <hi>The things which we find not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (saith St. <hi>Ambrose) how can we use them?</hi> Ambr.

                  <hi>where we may hang on what we will, and how we will, at our own pleasure; saying, this is heavy, and this is light; but let us bring the Divine Ballance of the Holy Scriptures, and in that let us weigh what is heavier; nay, let us not weigh, but let us own the things already weighed by the Lord.</hi> And elsewhere, <hi>The Holy Scripture</hi> (saith he) <hi>fixeth the Rule of our Doctrine.</hi> And indeed the excellent sayings of the <hi>Antients</hi> to this purpose are so well known, that I should be very vain to cite any more here.</p>
               <p>If now, after all this, I should suppose, what I can by no means yet grant, that God having order'd the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>written,</hi> and said so much in the <hi>Commendation</hi> thereof; they do not yet contain all things necessary to <hi>Salvation,</hi> but that some part of those <hi>necessary</hi> things (as both some <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> of old, and <hi>Papists</hi> now would have it believed) was only <hi>whisper'd</hi> privately into the <hi>Ears</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> unfit at that time to be communicated to <hi>vulgar Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi> and that the <hi>Apostles</hi> (tho they were commanded by <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>preach upon the House-tops that which he had told them privately in the Ear,</hi> Mar. 10. 27.) did not yet think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obliged to obey this Command in <hi>writing</hi> all that was <hi>necessary;</hi> but rather to conceal for a time, a considerable part of that <hi>mysterious</hi> Doctrine. Yea, suppose that this was one principal use of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Keys,</hi> to lock up all these <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> in the <hi>Cabinet</hi> of the Churches <hi>Breast</hi> (let the Church signify what it can) to be communicated to the World, in after-Ages by piece-meal, so as she should find Men prepar'd by a blind <hi>credulity</hi> to receive them. Yet after all, I must needs think, that we are too hardly dealt with to be called <hi>Hereticks</hi> for not believing these things, till something be produced, whereby we may be assur'd, either that these things which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54867:14"/>
they commend to us come indeed from <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apostles,</hi> or that we are obliged to take the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s word for a good <hi>Assurance.</hi> It seems to me a very unreasonable thing, that we should be condemn'd as <hi>obstinate,</hi> for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving things never sufficiently <hi>proved,</hi> whilst we know and declare our selves prepared in Mind to yield upon the first rational <hi>Conviction.</hi> Why should not that <hi>Church</hi> have the <hi>charity</hi> to forbear her <hi>Censures,</hi> till she have tried the strength of her <hi>Arguments?</hi> Why was the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Custom of other Councils, so liberal of her <hi>Curses,</hi> and so sparing of her <hi>Reasons?</hi> One good <hi>Reason</hi> would do more to make us of her Communion than a thousand <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's.</hi> Would not a Man suspect that they have no good <hi>Reasons</hi> to shew, who keep them so <hi>close?</hi> The plain <hi>Truth</hi> is, there have been such vain <hi>Pretences</hi> to <hi>Tradition</hi> in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, one contradicting another, that it seems impossible in this Age to discern between <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false.</hi> Did not <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> call it an <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> that Christ preach'd but one Year? And did not <hi>Irenaeus</hi> pretend a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, descending from St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> that Christ was about <hi>fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Years old when he was crucified? And do the <hi>Papists</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cout either of these to be <hi>true?</hi> Many things might be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which for some time have been received as <hi>Apostolical Traditions,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not now own to be so. And those which she owns, she can no more prove to be so, than those she hath <hi>rejected.</hi> It were easy to shew this, even from abundance of their own <hi>Writers,</hi> who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and complain of the <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> this pretence to <hi>Tradition</hi> hath done; and who confess, they cannot be proved to come from the <hi>Apostles.</hi> But I shall now content my self with the ingenuous Confession of the <hi>Bishops</hi> assembled at <hi>Bononia,</hi> in their Counsel given to P. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the 3<hi>d. We plainly confess</hi> (say they) <hi>among our selves, that we cannot prove that which we hold and teach concerning</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, <hi>but we have some conjectures only.</hi> And again; <hi>In
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54867:15"/>
truth whosoever shall diligently consider the Scripture, and then all the things that are usually done in our</hi> Churches, <hi>will find there is great difference betwixt them; and that this Doctrine of ours is very unlike, and in many things quite repugnant to it.</hi> What said <hi>Erasmus</hi> long since on the 2<hi>d Psalm: They call the People off</hi> (saith he) <hi>from the</hi> Scriptures <hi>unto little humane</hi> Traditions, <hi>which they have honestly invented for their own Profit.</hi> And <hi>Peter Suter,</hi> a bitter Adversary of his, hath these words; <hi>Since many things are delivered to be observed, which are not expresly found in Holy</hi> Scripture, <hi>will not unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Persons, taking notice of these things, easily murmur; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that so great Burdens should be laid upon them, whereby the Liberty of the Gospel is so greatly impaired? Will they not also easily be drawn away from the observance of Ecclesiastical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, when they shall find that they are not contained in the Law of Christ?</hi> And must we be <hi>Hereticks</hi> for not believing these so <hi>uncertain Traditions?</hi> Must our <hi>Faith</hi> be accounted <hi>defective</hi> and not <hi>entire,</hi> meerly because we do not believe what no Man can make us understand to co come from <hi>God?</hi> This seems very hard.</p>
               <p>It is now time for me to consider the <hi>second Objection</hi> made against our <hi>Faith,</hi> which is, That it is not <hi>rightly grounded,</hi> it is not built on the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed so much weight I find laid upon this <hi>one Point,</hi> that I have some reason to think, that they, who have been very forward at all times to give such liberal allowances of <hi>implicit Faith</hi> to their Friends at home, would be contented with a very small measure of <hi>explicit Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> in us, if we would once be taught to ground our <hi>Faith</hi> aright, on the <hi>sole Authority</hi> of that Church. It seems to me, that for the talk about it, they are no such rigid Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of an <hi>entire explicit Faith</hi> in order to <hi>Salvation,</hi> but that if we will explicitly <hi>believe</hi> this one <hi>fundamental Point,</hi> the <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> over all <hi>Christians,</hi> they will deal very favourably with us in most others; and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54867:15"/>
excuse our <hi>Ignorance</hi> easilier, than they can perswade us to be content to be <hi>ignorant.</hi> I think I have very good reason to believe this, because I know they can have no reason to reject them that believe but this one Point; for when once this great <hi>Gobbet</hi> is swallow'd down, the Passage will be so well open'd, that all other Points of <hi>Faith</hi> either go down with it, or will slip after it without the least <hi>straining</hi> or <hi>grutching.</hi> The <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself, speaking in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> will be of no farther <hi>consideration</hi> to us; for that we must suppose to be included in the <hi>Authority</hi> of our <hi>Mother</hi> the <hi>Church.</hi> And whatsoever we shall thence-forward perceive to be the <hi>Will</hi> of our <hi>Mother,</hi> we must without all scruple, conclude it to be also the Will of our <hi>Father.</hi> The <hi>Representer</hi> hath lately told us, that tho the <hi>Scripture</hi> (which is the <hi>Word</hi> of our <hi>Heavenly</hi> Father) may be the <hi>Law;</hi> yet the <hi>Mother,</hi> the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is the <hi>Iudg. Having learn'd from her the</hi> sense <hi>of the</hi> Scripture, <hi>we are obliged to submit to this, and never presume on our own private Sentiments, however seemingly grounded on</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>and</hi> Scripture, <hi>to believe or preach any new Doctrine opposite to the Belief of the</hi> Church. And there's reason for this, if it be true which he elsewhere tells us, <hi>That a Man may very</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54867:16"/>
                  <hi>Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and heed no more what either of these tell me; only I must have my Ear open to the <hi>Voice</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and be wholly at her <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>command,</hi> and I shall be <hi>safe</hi> enough.</p>
               <p>Upon the most serious consideration of the <hi>Character</hi> which the <hi>Papist</hi> is pleas'd to give us of himself, I cannot find what it is, for which they of that <hi>Church</hi> are so severely bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us <hi>Protestants;</hi> save only, that we will not, like tame <hi>Animals,</hi> without any <hi>understanding</hi> of our own, learn to <hi>come</hi> and go at a <hi>whistle;</hi> or <hi>trot</hi> on the Road as we are driven, and <hi>stoop</hi> to take on our Backs whatever Load it shall please the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to lay upon us, confessing her to have <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>uncontroulable Authority</hi> over our <hi>Faith. The standing out against the Catholick Church makes Men</hi> Hereticks, <hi>and without erring against this, no Man is guilty of</hi> Heresy, said the <hi>Iesuit Fisher,</hi> in his <hi>Answer</hi> to certain <hi>Questions</hi> propounded to him by King <hi>Iames</hi> I. This then is the only <hi>Heresy</hi> to disown the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> (for that he calls the <hi>Catholick.) Church. Again,</hi> saith he, <hi>One fundamental Error of the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, <hi>is their denying the</hi> Primacy <hi>of St.</hi> Peter <hi>and his</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, <hi>the Foundation which Christ laid of his</hi> Church, <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the perpetual Government thereof.</hi> And again, <hi>He that forsakes the</hi> Church, <hi>puts himself into a dead and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State, and may have all things besides Salvation and Eternal Life. Bellarmine</hi> speaks out, and tells us very plainly, <hi>No Man can, tho he would, be subject to Christ, and communicate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bel. de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. l. 3. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>with the</hi> Celestial Church, <hi>that is not subject to the Pope.</hi> If then we believe this <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all; and if we believe not <hi>this,</hi> we believe nothing at all, in the Papists account; or to any better purpose, than to our own Damnation. So that without this <hi>Belief</hi> our Faith shall never pass for an <hi>entire</hi> Faith; and when we once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, it shall never be any more question'd, whether it be <hi>entire</hi> or no.</p>

Now it seems a very hard matter to believe this great Point of <hi>Faith,</hi> till very good <hi>Reasons</hi> be given us for it; and yet (it should seem) the want of such Reasons will not excuse us from being <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and in a State of <hi>Damnation,</hi> no not tho we be never so ready to believe it, when we shall have <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> given us for it. <hi>For he is an</hi> Heretick (we are told) <hi>who thinks any thing against the</hi> Definition <hi>of the</hi> Church; <hi>yet</hi>

Now, seeing I have already found, that the great <hi>Reason,</hi> why we are held uncapable of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as now we are, is this; That we have no <hi>entire Faith;</hi> and the <hi>Defect</hi> in our <hi>Faith</hi> is this, That we believe not <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Roman Faith;</hi> and that which makes it <hi>necessary</hi> for us to believe <hi>all</hi> those <hi>Articles,</hi> is the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is, as they interpret, the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>define</hi> what things are <hi>necessary</hi> to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Christians; I perceive I have no more to do for my full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54867:17"/>
in the present Inquiry, but to consider, what <hi>Reason</hi> I can have for the <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>submitting</hi> to this <hi>Authority.</hi> And to discern this, I think this <hi>Method</hi> fittest to be taken: I will inquire into three things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>I.</hi> What things are implied in that <hi>Submission</hi> to this <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> which is required of me.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>II.</hi> What the Grounds and Reasons are whereon this <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is founded, and which should perswade me to <hi>submit.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>III.</hi> Where this <hi>Authority</hi> may be found, and to whom I must <hi>submit.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And this is all, I think, that I need to do; for I can never think fit to submit my <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> and to trust my <hi>Salvation</hi> to an <hi>Authority,</hi> which either requires of me such things as are unreasonable, or can produce no <hi>Reason</hi> for it self, or is so lodged in <hi>Obscurity</hi> as it cannot be <hi>found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. I cannot leave the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and enter into that of <hi>Rome,</hi> in obedience to an <hi>Authority</hi> which commands me to do things <hi>unreasonable,</hi> agreeing neither with the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> nor with the undoubted <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of Religion. If therefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> require such things of me, I must be a <hi>Protestant</hi> still, and <hi>protest</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that <hi>Authority,</hi> which <hi>She</hi> pretends to. And for ought I can yet see, I cannot submit to her <hi>Authority,</hi> but upon the hardest and most <hi>unreasonable</hi> Terms in the World. I must renounce my <hi>Reason</hi> and my <hi>Iudgment,</hi> I must no longer trust my <hi>Senses,</hi> I must either <hi>lay aside,</hi> or learn to speak <hi>dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> of <hi>God's Word;</hi> I must not believe a Word that <hi>God</hi> hath spoken, without that <hi>Church's Leave;</hi> I must embrace a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> for which, according to that <hi>Church's Principles,</hi> no <hi>Reason</hi> can be given to <hi>convince</hi> me; and when I have thus learn'd to do all things without <hi>Reason,</hi> I must do, what with <hi>Reason</hi> I can never do, believe all Men whatsoever, and how <hi>piously</hi> soever they otherwise live, if they be not of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

Communion, to be in a State of <hi>Damnation.</hi> If I be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in any thing of all this, I shall be very glad to know it; and I have only this to say for my self, that they were <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> who should know their own <hi>Religion</hi> best, that have deceived me; and if I may be deceiv'd by hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>them,</hi> whom that <hi>Church</hi> sends abroad to make us <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> I shall be the less encouraged hereafter, to embrace her <hi>Communion</hi> upon their <hi>Perswasions.</hi> Whether all, who are already of her <hi>Communion,</hi> either <hi>own</hi> or <hi>know</hi> all this, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not me to enquire; but I think it a Debt of <hi>Charity,</hi> that I owe them, to think, (till they tell me the contrary) that they do not; and that, if they did, they would not long continue where they are. However, till they, who taught me these things, shall either confess their <hi>own Error,</hi> or shew me <hi>my Mistake,</hi> I must needs think them all true; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also account it much <hi>safer</hi> for me to continue a <hi>Protestant,</hi> than to turn <hi>Papist,</hi> whatever it may <hi>seem,</hi> or <hi>be</hi> to <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I think nothing can be plainer, than that it is more <hi>safe</hi> to act like <hi>understanding,</hi> and <hi>discreet, considering</hi> Men, than <hi>otherwise;</hi> or, that the <hi>Religion,</hi> which alloweth Men so to do, is <hi>safer</hi> than that which doth not allow it. Now the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> alloweth Men to make use of their <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> to discern between <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood, Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> which the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> (as it seems to me) will not allow; and therefore it must needs be the <hi>safer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> certainly came not into the World to <hi>save Sinners</hi> by <hi>destroying,</hi> but rather by <hi>restoring</hi> and <hi>perfecting</hi> Human Nature. His business was not to <hi>deprive</hi> us of the use of the most noble Faculty which God had given us; but to <hi>rectify that,</hi> and all the <hi>rest,</hi> after they had been depraved by Sin. His <hi>Gospel</hi> was not preached to <hi>close up</hi> the Eye of the Soul, the Understanding, and so to lead Men <hi>blindfold</hi> to Heaven; but <hi>to open Mens Eyes, and to furn them from Darkness to Light,</hi> Act. 26. 18. The Apostles preach'd, to teach us how
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54867:18"/>
to offer unto God a <hi>Reasonable Service:</hi> Rom. 12. 1. And <hi>Christ</hi> expects, that <hi>his Sheep should be able to discern the voice of him</hi> their <hi>Shepherd,</hi> from the <hi>voice</hi> of <hi>Strangers;</hi> and, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding them,</hi> to <hi>follow him</hi> only; <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 4, 5. St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts Men, to be <hi>always ready to give a Reason of the Hope that is in them;</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 15. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids Men <hi>prove all things, and hold fast that which is good;</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 21. And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> exhorts, <hi>not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits whether they be of God;</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1. How any Man shall be able to do all this, and much more, which as a <hi>Christian</hi> he is obliged to do, and not be allow'd the free use of his <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>judging Faculty,</hi> I am sure, no Man can tell me; neither indeed how he can be of any <hi>Religion</hi> at all; for before he can really be of any <hi>Religion,</hi> he must <hi>choose</hi> it; and <hi>choose</hi> it he cannot, till he have rationally <hi>consider'd</hi> and <hi>judg'd</hi> of it, and of the <hi>Reasons</hi> which must move him to the <hi>choice</hi> of it. And in Truth, to deny a Man the free <hi>use</hi> of his <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Iudgment</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> is to turn him into a <hi>Beast,</hi> where he should be most a <hi>Man;</hi> and either to make it impossible for him to be of any <hi>Religion</hi> at all, and to serve <hi>God</hi> like a <hi>Man;</hi> or else to say in effect, That <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is altogether a most <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing, and proper only to <hi>unreasonable Creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Writing Men</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> tell us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more frequently, than that no <hi>private</hi> Man ought to be allow'd to <hi>judg</hi> for himself in matters of <hi>Faith;</hi> that to allow this, is to set the <hi>Gate</hi> wide open to all <hi>Heresies;</hi> that every Man is bound to <hi>sumbit</hi> and <hi>captivate</hi> his <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Iudgment</hi> to the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, to all the <hi>Definitions</hi> of (as they call it) the <hi>Roman-Catholick Church.</hi> Whatsoever this <hi>Church</hi> affirms, we must believe to be <hi>true;</hi> and whatsoever <hi>She</hi> commands, we must chearfully <hi>obey,</hi> seem the thing to our own <hi>private Reason</hi> never so <hi>false,</hi> or never so wicked. We must not dare to examine the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of her <hi>Decrees</hi> or <hi>Determinations,</hi> tho <hi>Reason</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:54867:18"/>
and <hi>Scripture</hi> too, seem to us to be against them, as we have been lately taught by the <hi>Representer;</hi> for as we receive from <hi>Her</hi> the <hi>Books,</hi> so from <hi>Her only</hi> we are to receive the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Hence it is, that they define a <hi>Heretick,</hi> to be one that <hi>obstinately</hi> opposeth the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Fathers (Bellarmine</hi> some-where tells us) may be examined by <hi>Reason,</hi> because they teach but as <hi>private Doctors;</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> teaches as a <hi>Iudg,</hi> with all <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and therefore no Man may <hi>dispute</hi> the soundness of her <hi>Doctrine.</hi> This then is the <hi>first</hi> step I must take, if I will go over to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> I must resolve to <hi>see</hi> no longer for <hi>my self</hi> with my own Eyes, but give my self up to be led by the <hi>Church,</hi> never questioning the <hi>Way</hi> I am to go in, so long as <hi>she</hi> leads me. And truly so far as I am yet able to discern with my <hi>Protestant Eyes,</hi> it is but needful to close the Eye of <hi>Reason</hi> before-hand, when I am about to go, where I must otherwise see such things as no <hi>Reason</hi> can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. It was therefore very <hi>ingenuously</hi> spoken (as I have heard) of Mr. <hi>Cressy,</hi> when he said, <hi>that the</hi> Wit <hi>and</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of</hi> Catholicks, <hi>is to</hi> renounce <hi>their own</hi> Judgment, <hi>and</hi> depose <hi>their own</hi> Wit. Yet if this be true, I must beg his Pardon, if I dare not yet imitate his <hi>Example,</hi> or follow him thither, where (according to him) I can have nothing to do, but to run headlong upon any thing without <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Fear. Reason</hi> he is pleased to call a <hi>hoodwink'd Guide;</hi> and following it, all we can hope for, is, that we may possibly stumble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Church.</hi> Possibly (it should seem) a Man may stumble upon it with his <hi>Eyes</hi> in his <hi>Head;</hi> and truly, I dare not <hi>pull</hi> them <hi>out,</hi> lest I should stumble on a <hi>blind Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and we should both fall into the <hi>Ditch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> Whensoever I resolve to enter into the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> I fear I must also bid farewell to my <hi>Senses;</hi> or resolve never any more to trust them, no, not about those things, which are the <hi>proper Objects</hi> of <hi>Sense;</hi> to discern which, <hi>God</hi> gave me my <hi>Senses;</hi> and of which it will be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54867:19"/>
impossible for me to have any <hi>distinct knowledg</hi> without them.</p>
               <p>How <hi>unreasonable</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> a thing this is, I must needs be very <hi>sensible,</hi> if I be not resolved already to hearken no more to my <hi>Reason.</hi> If I must no longer credit my <hi>Eyes</hi> about <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Colour,</hi> nor my <hi>Ears</hi> about <hi>Sounds</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> nor my <hi>Nose</hi> about <hi>Smells,</hi> nor my <hi>Palate</hi> concerning <hi>Tasts,</hi> nor my <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feeling</hi> about <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Cold, Hard</hi> and <hi>Soft;</hi> I shall not know how to believe, that <hi>God</hi> gave me all these <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> to any purpose at all; I am sure, I cannot think my self in a <hi>comfortable</hi> and <hi>safe</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I know not to what end our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> should bid St. <hi>Thomas, Handle</hi> and <hi>see him;</hi> or how his <hi>Faith</hi> could be thereby <hi>confirmed,</hi> if such <hi>Senses</hi> are not to be trusted: nor why the <hi>Apostle</hi> should hope to have the more Credit given to their <hi>Narratives,</hi> by telling us they were <hi>Eye-witnesses</hi> of the things they relate; 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 16. Luke</hi> 1. 2. Nor why St. <hi>Iohn (1 Ioh.</hi> 1. 1.) should talk so much of <hi>hearing, seeing</hi> and <hi>handling,</hi> as things qualifying them for bearing <hi>witness.</hi> What a Christian am I like to be, if I can have no Assurance of what I <hi>see</hi> or <hi>hear;</hi> if I may not trust my <hi>Eyes</hi> when I read the Scripture, nor my <hi>Ears</hi> when I hear the Instructions of my Teachers? How could the first Christians be sure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or assure us, that <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Christ,</hi> if in hearing his <hi>Words,</hi> and seeing his <hi>Miracles,</hi> and reading the <hi>Prophets,</hi> they might not safely trust their <hi>Senses?</hi> If <hi>Sense</hi> be not to be trusted, all <hi>Teaching</hi> must be by immediate Inspiration; and <hi>Faith</hi> comes not by <hi>hearing,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms it doth; and the <hi>Infallible Church</hi> can teach no more than we, except she can teach without <hi>Speaking</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> or any thing that is to be understood by <hi>Hearing</hi> or <hi>Seeing;</hi> and so <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Tradition</hi> can be of no more use to us, than to the <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>Deaf.</hi> On this Supposition, I may easily mistake a <hi>Harlot</hi> for my <hi>Mother,</hi> and stumble into <hi>Babylon</hi> instead of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> hearken to the Voice of the <hi>Wolf</hi> instead of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54867:19"/>
                  <hi>Shepherd,</hi> eat and drink <hi>Poison</hi> instead of <hi>wholsome Food,</hi> and feel no <hi>Pain</hi> nor <hi>Loss</hi> when my <hi>Eyes</hi> are pluck'd out.</p>
               <p>Now if the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> do not command us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all <hi>Credit</hi> to our <hi>Senses,</hi> she cannot command us to give any <hi>Credit</hi> to her Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> And I fear, without our believing this <hi>Point,</hi> she will not admit us to her <hi>Communion.</hi> We believe already a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of that which we <hi>see not,</hi> yet will not this serve, unless we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve also a <hi>Real Absence</hi> of that which we both <hi>see, handle, taste</hi> and <hi>smell.</hi> In the holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> I am commanded to believe that there is not any <hi>Bread,</hi> but <hi>Flesh;</hi> nor <hi>Wine,</hi> but <hi>Blood;</hi> and yet there I <hi>see, smell, taste</hi> and <hi>feel</hi> both <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> and nothing else. I <hi>hear</hi> it read, that our <hi>Blessed Saviour took, blessed, brake</hi> and <hi>gave Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> and of the <hi>same</hi> he said, <hi>Take, eat</hi> and <hi>drink.</hi> I hear St. <hi>Paul</hi> again and again (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26, 27, 28.) speak of <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup.</hi> And yet I must not trust any of these <hi>five Senses,</hi> but against the clearest <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> of them all, I must believe (if I can) that there is neither <hi>Bread</hi> nor <hi>Wine,</hi> but that, which neither my <hi>Senses</hi> can discern, nor my <hi>Reason</hi> conceive, nor doth the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> any where say, the very <hi>Natural Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> under the <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Taste</hi> and <hi>Smell,</hi> and all other proper <hi>Qualities</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Colour,</hi> nor <hi>Form,</hi> nor <hi>Taste,</hi> nor <hi>Smell,</hi> nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Accident,</hi> which my <hi>Senses</hi> there perceive, are in the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> tho there is nothing else there for them to be in. That tho I <hi>break</hi> and <hi>chew</hi> with my Teeth what I <hi>take</hi> and <hi>eat;</hi> yet I <hi>break</hi> not, nor <hi>chew</hi> with my Teeth the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> and yet I <hi>take</hi> and <hi>eat</hi> nothing else. If I cannot believe this, I am told that I have not <hi>Faith</hi> enough, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because I have yet <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sense</hi> too much, to be of that <hi>Communion.</hi> This is another step that I must take in going over to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And when I am got thus far, I may think it seasonable enough to lay aside the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54867:20"/>
                  <hi>Scripture</hi> too: For what good <hi>Use</hi> I can make of it, without the free use of my <hi>Reason,</hi> and trusting my <hi>Senses,</hi> I do not understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If I be a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> and not of so good credit with the <hi>Curate</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> as to obtain a <hi>License;</hi> that is, if I will not promise to adhere only to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and take all that I read in that <hi>sense only,</hi> which she is pleas'd to give it; I must not be suffer'd to read the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> at all, but must give away my <hi>Bible,</hi> upon pain of being denied the <hi>Remission</hi> of my <hi>Sins.</hi> And truly if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to read it upon no other <hi>terms,</hi> than of being thus tied up, to learn nothing by it, but what I am before-hand taught without it; I shall think a <hi>License</hi> too dear, even at a very <hi>low</hi> rate; if yet it may be obtain'd, as I find it question'd, whether it may or no, any where else, but in such places as a <hi>License</hi> to read some of their <hi>own,</hi> may prevent their itch of looking into <hi>our Translations.</hi> However, whether I be of the <hi>Lay</hi> or <hi>Clergy,</hi> if I will learn of them who are most bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy in endeavouring my <hi>Conversion;</hi> I am sure I must be taught to speak very <hi>dishonourably</hi> of the <hi>Word of God;</hi> and this seems to be no more than the <hi>Religion</hi> commended to me requireth.</p>
               <p>I must needs here say, That nothing in the World <hi>doth</hi> (and I think I may say, <hi>ought)</hi> more to prejudice me against any <hi>Religion,</hi> than to find it constrain'd in its own <hi>Defence,</hi> to say <hi>undecent</hi> things of that which it grants to be the <hi>Word of God.</hi> And if I might be thought worthy to advise the <hi>Missionaries,</hi> they should not harp too much on this <hi>ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> String, if they would draw any after them that have the least <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God's Honour.</hi> I am verily oerswaded, that the <hi>good Language</hi> they bestow upon the <hi>Scripture,</hi> hath kept more out of their <hi>Church,</hi> than ever their <hi>Arguments</hi> yet won. I will not now take notice of those too well known <hi>Encomiums</hi> bestow'd upon it, by some of their <hi>Communion,</hi> calling it a <hi>Nose of Wax,</hi> a <hi>Leaden Rule,</hi> a <hi>dead Letter, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens'd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54867:20"/>
Characters,</hi> and I am ashamed to say what more. I shall only observe what is ordinarily taught us and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd with much <hi>Art</hi> to be prov'd by their <hi>best,</hi> most <hi>modest,</hi> and generally <hi>approved Authors:</hi> as, That the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not <hi>Necessary;</hi> that it hath no <hi>Authority</hi> as to us, but from the <hi>Church;</hi> that it is an <hi>imperfect,</hi> an <hi>insufficient Rule;</hi> that it is an <hi>obscure Book,</hi> and finally, a very <hi>dangerous</hi> one to be read by the <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know very well, That the <hi>Representer,</hi> and others of them tell us, <hi>That the</hi> Papist <hi>believes it damnable in any one, to think, speak, or to do any thing irreverently towards the</hi> Scripture, <hi>and that he holds it in the highest Veneration of all Men living.</hi> I know also, that most of them, even whilst they are industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously proving all that I but now said, do yet labour to <hi>mollify</hi> and <hi>sweeten</hi> their own <hi>harsh Expressions,</hi> which they know must needs grate the <hi>Ears</hi> of all <hi>pious</hi> Persons. I am also ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perswaded, that many <hi>Papists</hi> have a very <hi>venerable esteem</hi> for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and are not a little <hi>troubled</hi> to hear it <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully</hi> used. And yet I cannot see that <hi>highest Veneration</hi> for it, or that they speak not very <hi>irreverently</hi> of it, who speak no worse of it, than the <hi>Representer</hi> himself hath taught them, <hi>viz. That it is not fit to be read generally of all without License;</hi> tho he gives this very good reason for it, <hi>Lest they should no longer acknowledg the Authority of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church;</hi> or in his own words, <hi>No Authority left by Christ, to which they are to submit.</hi> As tho Men might be taught by the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be disobedient to any <hi>Authority</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> hath set up in his <hi>Church.</hi> I cannot see any great <hi>Veneration</hi> he hath to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> in saying, <hi>They allow a restraint upon the reading of the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>for the preventing of a blind ignorant Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the casting of the Holy to Dogs, or Pearls to Swine,</hi> (such too is his respect for <hi>Christians) That he hath no other assurance that they are the Word of God, but by the Authority
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54867:21"/>
and Canon of the Church. That almost every Text of the</hi> Bible <hi>and even those that concern the most essential and fundamental Points of the Christian Religion may be interpreted several ways, and made to signify things contrary to one another. That it is altogether silent, without discovering which of all those Senses is that intended by the Holy Ghost, and leading to Truth; and which are erroneous and Antichristian. That a Man may frame as many</hi> Creeds <hi>as he pleases, and make Christ and his Apostles speak what shall be most agreeable to his Humour, and suit best with his Interest, and find plain Proofs for all. That it alone can be no Rule of</hi> Faith <hi>to any private or particular Person.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they who talk of the <hi>Scripture</hi> at this rate, have not the <hi>highest Veneration</hi> for it, of all Men living.</p>
               <p>They that say, and labour to <hi>prove,</hi> that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not <hi>necessary,</hi> may well be supposed to think, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> might do well enough without it. And, tho to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the <hi>Odiousness</hi> of this <hi>Assertion,</hi> they are forced to confess it is a <hi>Lie,</hi> without the help of some such <hi>mental Reservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as this, <hi>So that God could not, if he pleas'd, preserve his Truth among Men, some other way than by writing it;</hi> yet doth not this speak in them the <hi>like Veneration</hi> for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Protestants</hi> have, who down-rightly affirm it to be <hi>necessary.</hi> And it must needs sound ill to say, That the <hi>All-wise God</hi> hath been very careful to leave and preserve in his <hi>Church</hi> an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary thing.</hi> Yea, 'tis altogether as absurd to say, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not <hi>necessary, because</hi> God <hi>could, if it had seem'd good to him, have preserv'd his</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Faith <hi>without it:</hi> As it would be to say, that <hi>Plowing</hi> and <hi>Sowing,</hi> or <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> are not <hi>necessary,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> could, if he pleas'd, make the Ground bring forth without the <hi>one,</hi> and preserve Man's Life without the <hi>other.</hi> Nor can it be imagin'd that any Man upon this account only, would venture to say, and attempt to prove the <hi>Scripture</hi> not to be <hi>necessary</hi> in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54867:21"/>
a sense, wherein no Man ever <hi>affirm'd</hi> it; if he were not so <hi>zealously</hi> bent upon <hi>lessening</hi> the <hi>Esteem</hi> which we have for it, that he will chuse rather to say <hi>nothing</hi> to the <hi>purpose,</hi> and <hi>dispute</hi> against no Body, than to be <hi>silent,</hi> and say <hi>nothing</hi> that <hi>sounds ill</hi> of it; and that he thinks it needful for the <hi>ends</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> so to do.</p>
               <p>In like manner, when they contend that the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> is from the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the thing whereof at every turn they are forward enough to mind us; they are forced again to make some <hi>Abatements</hi> to make it seem a <hi>Truth.</hi> 'Tis true, they say, that consider'd in <hi>it self alone,</hi> it hath its <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>God;</hi> whereby they can mean no more, but that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of it; but in relation to <hi>us,</hi> it hath its <hi>Authority</hi> from the <hi>Church.</hi> Now I would fain know, what any Man can understand properly by the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but its relation to <hi>us,</hi> or the <hi>Power</hi> it hath to <hi>command</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> in it, and <hi>Obedience</hi> to it, as the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And if it have all <hi>this Power</hi> from the <hi>Church,</hi> as is confidently affirm'd, then tho <hi>it self</hi> be of <hi>God,</hi> yet <hi>all</hi> its Authority is from the Church; and it must needs be true, which was said by one of them, <hi>That it is of no more Authority than</hi> Livy <hi>or</hi> Aesop'<hi>s</hi> Fables <hi>without the</hi> Churches Declaration. Thus is the Authority of <hi>God's Word</hi> made to depend upon the Authority of <hi>Men,</hi> and all our Faith is no more but <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Faith resting upon humane <hi>Testimony.</hi> And if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which it hath to oblige <hi>us,</hi> be from the <hi>Church,</hi> I would know by what Authority it doth oblige the <hi>Church;</hi> it is not sure, by any Authority from <hi>Her,</hi> for then I see no reason why the <hi>Church</hi> may not <hi>chuse</hi> whether she will <hi>receive</hi> it or no; whilst yet I think, that it is only by the Authority of the <hi>Scripture</hi> that she can pretend to be a <hi>Church,</hi> and to have any Authority at all. However this I am sure of, that they who say the <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be receiv'd for the Churches
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54867:22"/>
                  <hi>Sake,</hi> have not so <hi>high a Veneration,</hi> either for <hi>it,</hi> or the <hi>Author</hi> of it, as they who say it is to be receiv'd for <hi>God's Sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the <hi>next</hi> place, whether <hi>we,</hi> who say the <hi>Scripture</hi> is a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>sufficient Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>Salvation;</hi> or <hi>they,</hi> who say, 'tis but a <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>imperfect Rule: We,</hi> who say; 'tis <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>easy</hi> to be understood in all things <hi>necessary;</hi> or <hi>They,</hi> who say 'tis <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>obscure,</hi> unable to <hi>inform</hi> and <hi>resolve Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Doubters,</hi> and <hi>Inquirers,</hi> and that even in <hi>Essentials</hi> and <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> Finally, Whether <hi>We,</hi> who say, it ought to be <hi>read</hi> and <hi>studied</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Men; Or <hi>They,</hi> who say, it is not <hi>needful,</hi> yea, <hi>dangerous</hi> to be read of <hi>all,</hi> have the <hi>higher Veneration</hi> for the Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to determine; if to <hi>commend</hi> a thing, may be said to be more <hi>Honour</hi> to it, than to <hi>disparage</hi> it. And tho here again, they use some <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Colour</hi> to set off such <hi>ill-favour'd</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as well as they can; yet serves this to no other end in my Mind, but to make them more <hi>Ugly</hi> and <hi>Odious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They deny not (for all this, they say) the <hi>Perfection, Sufficiency,</hi> or <hi>Plainness</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor that it may be <hi>read</hi> by the <hi>People.</hi> What then is it they say? They affirm, that it contains all <hi>necessary Truths,</hi> either <hi>Explicitly,</hi> or at least <hi>Virtually;</hi> for some <hi>Truths</hi> it declares <hi>expresly,</hi> and yet so, as the <hi>Church alone</hi> must give the <hi>Sense;</hi> and for all the rest, it <hi>plainly</hi> (if the same <hi>Church</hi> may here also give the <hi>Sense)</hi> sends us to the <hi>Church</hi> to learn them. Now I cannot (for my Heart) imagine what all this can signify, but only a desire to <hi>lessen</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi>'s <hi>Authority,</hi> as <hi>plausibly</hi> as they can. To me it seems very plain, that they make the <hi>Scripture</hi> just <hi>nothing,</hi> and the <hi>Church all</hi> in <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54867:22"/>
I think it here again, well deserves my <hi>Consideration,</hi> That the SCRIPTURE is very <hi>copious</hi> in <hi>declaring,</hi> and <hi>repeating</hi> too, over and over again, many <hi>necessary</hi> Points of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Duty;</hi> and not only <hi>necessary</hi> things, but many other things also it largely teacheth, which are by all granted to be of less <hi>moment</hi> and <hi>necessity</hi> to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of Men; and all this it doth in as <hi>plain Words</hi> and <hi>Phrases,</hi> as can be used. And hence I find it very hard for me to believe, that the HOLY GHOST, by whose <hi>Inspiration</hi> it was <hi>Written,</hi> should do all this for our <hi>Instruction,</hi> and that in a <hi>Book</hi> written on <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> to make us <hi>wise</hi> unto <hi>Salvation,</hi> and by <hi>himself</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>able</hi> so to do, and yet omit many things of <hi>greatest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> to that end; never so much as once, no not in any <hi>obscure</hi> manner, pointing out to us that <hi>Church,</hi> to whose <hi>Authority</hi> we must <hi>resort</hi> and <hi>submit.</hi> This were to leave us a <hi>Treasure</hi> closely <hi>lock'd</hi> up, and not to tell us where we may find the <hi>Key,</hi> that can let us in to it, and so we are neither the <hi>Wiser,</hi> nor the <hi>Richer</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever the PAPISTS are pleas'd to alledg for their speaking thus of the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Blessed God,</hi> I confess I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think any better of their <hi>Religion</hi> for it. Let us say what we will in <hi>Commendation</hi> of holy SCRIPTURE, they will be sure to find something to say against it; lest, I suppose, it should be thought, we can at any time speak <hi>Truth.</hi> And when we charge them for speaking <hi>dishonourably</hi> of the SCRIPTURE, they so interpret their Words, as they seem to say the same that we did, and which they blamed us for. What can be their <hi>meaning</hi> in this, but either to make the World believe that we are in an <hi>Error;</hi> tho, when they come to <hi>Apologize</hi> for themselves, they are forced to <hi>confess</hi> it a <hi>Truth;</hi> or that their <hi>Religion</hi> necessarily requires it of them in its <hi>Vindication,</hi> to <hi>vilify</hi> the SCRIPTURE; tho by saying such things of it, as they acknowledge cannot be <hi>true,</hi> unless interpreted so, as to speak <hi>our Sense?</hi> They must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this, deal either very <hi>disingenuously</hi> with <hi>us,</hi> or very
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54867:23"/>
                  <hi>injuriously</hi> with the holy SCRIPTURE. For my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, that Men professing the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and owning the SCRIPTURE to be the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, could ever be persuaded to speak so, as but <hi>seemingly</hi> to <hi>vilify</hi> or <hi>disparage</hi> it, if their <hi>Doctrines</hi> could be any other way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Their <hi>Religion,</hi> I say, must need it, or <hi>they</hi> too little consult the <hi>Honour</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> in needlesly utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring such Speeches, as stand in need of a very great measure of <hi>Charity,</hi> to think them less than <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If any PROTESTANT dares venture thus far, towards the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME; the <hi>next</hi> thing he has to do, is to resolve, not to believe one <hi>Word</hi> that GOD speaks, without that <hi>Church's leave.</hi> I am confident, that there are not many of our <hi>Lay-</hi>PAPISTS, that think themselves to be under this <hi>Obligation;</hi> and that if they were sensible of it, they would make haste to break loose from it. But for my own part, I see not how I can enter into their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> but I must draw it upon my self. And this I think, would be to advance the ROMAN <hi>Church</hi> to as great a <hi>height</hi> in my esteem, as <hi>they</hi> in her, who are most zealous for her Infallibility, can desire. What more would they have, than that GOD <hi>himself,</hi> where they confess <hi>he speaks,</hi> should stand to their <hi>Church's Courtesy,</hi> whether or no he should be <hi>believed?</hi> I know it will be said, They never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow'd any man to <hi>believe</hi> GOD. But because all men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>understand</hi> GOD speaking in the SCRIPTURE, the <hi>Church</hi> is appointed by <hi>Him</hi> to be his <hi>Interpreter.</hi> This I hear, and to me it sounds not well, That GOD should speak to Men things <hi>necessary</hi> for <hi>all</hi> to know, and which he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all</hi> to <hi>learn</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> upon pain of eternal <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and yet not speak so <hi>intelligibly,</hi> as they may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Him. Certainly, he that made the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and gave man <hi>Understanding,</hi> can speak (if he please) as <hi>Intelligibly</hi> as the <hi>Church,</hi> which cannot <hi>Speak</hi> or <hi>Understand</hi> at all,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54867:23"/>
without his <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Teaching.</hi> And considering his <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodness</hi> and <hi>Impartiality;</hi> till he shall tell me so <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> I know not how to <hi>believe</hi> that he hath so much more <hi>respect</hi> to the <hi>Honour</hi> of the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> than to the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that he would so deliver things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Salvation,</hi> that no Man can be able to <hi>understand,</hi> and be the <hi>better</hi> for them, but he that resorts to that <hi>Church</hi> as God's sole <hi>Interpreter.</hi> And if indeed she be so, it must follow, that we cannot believe one <hi>Word</hi> that God <hi>speaks</hi> without <hi>her leave.</hi> For, therefore is she made <hi>God's Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,</hi> because otherwise we cannot <hi>understand</hi> his <hi>Word;</hi> and I am sure, what we cannot <hi>understand,</hi> we cannot <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Sense,</hi> they say, and not the <hi>Letter,</hi> is <hi>God's Word;</hi> and this <hi>Sense</hi> is in the <hi>Church's Breast,</hi> and of <hi>Her alone</hi> we must learn it; and therefore, till She give us <hi>leave,</hi> we cannot <hi>believe</hi> it, no not so much as, that JESUS is the CHRIST; altho, till we believe <hi>this,</hi> we cannot believe that he hath a <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore cannot believe She is <hi>His Interpreter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not now inquire into the Reasons, Why this <hi>Church,</hi> which is <hi>God's sole Interpreter,</hi> takes so excellent a Course to make her <hi>Children</hi> understand <hi>God's Word.</hi> Why <hi>first,</hi> She keeps it in the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> only, whereof the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of them understand not one Syllable. Why <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> She doth not give them some <hi>Infallible Translation, Interpretation,</hi> or <hi>Comment</hi> of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> a thing very easie for an <hi>Infallible Interpreter</hi> to do; and therefore, in my Opinion, must argue a great <hi>defect</hi> in her <hi>Charity,</hi> and much <hi>unfaithfulness</hi> in the discharge of her <hi>Trust,</hi> if she do it not. I am loath to ask such <hi>Questions</hi> as these, because I find it goes so much against the Hair to answer them. Indeed I think she doth not the <hi>latter</hi> for a very good Reason, because <hi>she cannot;</hi> and 'tis only her vain <hi>pretence</hi> to such a <hi>Power,</hi> that makes her <hi>inexcusable</hi> if she do it not. And the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> she is concern'd to do, that they, who have the <hi>Word
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54867:24"/>
of God</hi> only in a <hi>Language</hi> which they cannot <hi>understand,</hi> may be constrain'd of necessity to <hi>depend</hi> upon her <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and never to question her <hi>Authority,</hi> nor discern her <hi>Errors.</hi> Whilst they have nothing of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but from her mouth, they can have no more of it, than what she gives them <hi>leave</hi> to have; and therefore, can neither believe a <hi>Word</hi> of what GOD <hi>speaks,</hi> nor indeed that he hath <hi>spoken</hi> any thing but by her <hi>leave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> speaks very <hi>plainly,</hi> and <hi>intelligibly</hi> enough in the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> forbidding the <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> as plainly, as he forbids to <hi>commit Adultery,</hi> or to <hi>Steal.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> spake very <hi>plainly,</hi> and as <hi>intelligibly,</hi> saying, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve,</hi> Matt. 4. 10. And again, when he said of the <hi>Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Cup, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> Matt. 26. 27. as when he said, <hi>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy Neighbour as thy self.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> very <hi>plainly</hi> ordereth, that the <hi>publick Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> be perform'd in a <hi>known Tongue,</hi> and sheweth the great <hi>absurdity</hi> of using an <hi>unknown Tongue</hi> in <hi>God's Worship,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. And he speaks <hi>intelligibly</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when he saith, <hi>Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. To say no more, we think it <hi>plainly</hi> enough said, of them that <hi>die in the Lord, that they rest from their labours,</hi> Rev. 14. 13. In all these things we hear <hi>God speak,</hi> and would fain <hi>believe him.</hi> But here the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME comes in with her <hi>Authority,</hi> and tells us, That, tho GOD have said, <hi>He only is to be worshipped,</hi> we must <hi>believe,</hi> that <hi>not he only,</hi> but also the <hi>Cross, Images, Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> are to have a share in our <hi>Religious Worship.</hi> And say CHRIST and his <hi>Apostles</hi> what they please to the contrary, we must believe, that not <hi>all,</hi> but the <hi>sacrificing Priest</hi> ought to <hi>drink of the Cup;</hi> that <hi>God's publick Worship</hi> is well perform'd in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Tongue;</hi> that we neither <hi>eat Bread,</hi> nor <hi>drink Wine</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> that <hi>all who died in the Lord, do not rest from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54867:24"/>
their labours;</hi> but that the most of them go into most <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful torments.</hi> At this rate, for ought I can see, must I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Word of God,</hi> when I have once submitted to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It seems very hard for me to conceive how I should be bound under penalty of <hi>Eternal Damnation,</hi> to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse a <hi>Religion,</hi> and submit to an <hi>Authority,</hi> for which no <hi>convincing Reason</hi> can be given me by them that invite me to it. What is it in any <hi>Religion,</hi> which can <hi>commend</hi> it before others to a man's <hi>Choice,</hi> but its <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness?</hi> And how should the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of any <hi>Religion</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to my <hi>Choice,</hi> till they be <hi>discover'd</hi> unto me, and I be <hi>rationally convinced</hi> that it hath them? Whatever <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodnoss</hi> there may really be in the <hi>Religion</hi> called PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERY, I am sure they can be no <hi>motives</hi> to me to embrace it, till they be clearly laid open to my <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> that I may plainly discern them; and therefore, if any PAPIST will take an <hi>effectual</hi> course to <hi>Convert</hi> me to it, he must by <hi>rational</hi> means <hi>convince</hi> me first, that <hi>his</hi> is the <hi>true Church,</hi> and her <hi>Doctrines sound</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How he can do this upon his own <hi>Principles,</hi> I see not yet; but rather think it a very gross <hi>absurdity</hi> in <hi>him</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. He tells me often, that no <hi>private</hi> Person, such as I am, ought to <hi>judg</hi> for <hi>himself</hi> in Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> or therein to follow his own <hi>private Iudgment,</hi> tho to him grounded both on <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Scripture.</hi> He must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in disputing with me, (according to his own <hi>Doctrine)</hi> bring either <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Scripture</hi> to <hi>convince</hi> me, for I must not trust my own <hi>private Iudgment,</hi> (and I know no other that I have) tho (as it seems to me) grounded both on <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Scripture.</hi> I must not <hi>judg</hi> for <hi>my self</hi> by <hi>either</hi> of them, whether what he commends to me by them, be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> and then I cannot imagine to what end he useth them in any dispute with me. He must resolve therefore, (for ought
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54867:25"/>
I can see) whenever he would <hi>convert</hi> me, to <hi>judg</hi> for me too, as well as <hi>dispute</hi> with me; and then, if I cannot make a right <hi>Choice</hi> for <hi>my self,</hi> he may do it for me; tho after all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>his private Iudgment</hi> be any more to be trusted in such a case, than <hi>my own,</hi> I may possibly doubt.</p>
               <p>Either it is a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> That the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME is the <hi>only true Church,</hi> and that <hi>She</hi> hath this <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>determining</hi> for all <hi>Christians,</hi> which is the <hi>saving Faith</hi> of CHRIST, or it is not. If it be <hi>not,</hi> I may be safe enough, tho I <hi>believe</hi> it not; and 'tis ill done of PAPISTS to terrify me with these <hi>big Words,</hi> which are as <hi>false</hi> as <hi>terrible,</hi> That I cannot be <hi>saved</hi> without <hi>believing this.</hi> If it be a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> then must I either be allow'd to <hi>judg</hi> for my self by my <hi>own private judgment</hi> in a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> or all the PAPISTS endeavours to <hi>persuade</hi> me to believe it, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>vain,</hi> unless it be <hi>reasonable</hi> for me to believe a thing against my <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Iudgment.</hi> When he useth <hi>Arguments,</hi> I should think he meant thereby to <hi>convince</hi> me in my <hi>private Iudgment;</hi> but it seems, 'tis only to drive me <hi>out</hi> of it; and that, if I may <hi>use</hi> it at all, it is only to this <hi>end,</hi> that I may conclude I have <hi>no use</hi> of it. All the <hi>Arguments</hi> in the World cannot <hi>convince</hi> me, till I <hi>judg</hi> of them; and therefore no PAPIST can offer me a <hi>Reason</hi> why I should embrace PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERY, but he must <hi>contradict himself,</hi> and give me as strong a <hi>Reason,</hi> why I should not embrace it, because its <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>false.</hi> It will be all one, as if he should say, I <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>convinced</hi> by <hi>Reason,</hi> and yet I neither <hi>ought</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> by it. In urging his <hi>Reasons</hi> upon me, he intends they should <hi>convince</hi> me; in <hi>denying</hi> me the <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>judging</hi> for my self by <hi>Reason,</hi> he denies that any <hi>Reasons</hi> can <hi>convince</hi> me; because 'tis plain, they cannot <hi>convince</hi> me before I have <hi>judged</hi> of them, and this I must do by my <hi>private Iudgment,</hi> or by nothing, for I have no other.</p>
               <p>But here I am told, We are allow'd to make use of our <hi>Reason</hi> to find out the <hi>true Church,</hi> which may <hi>Infallibly</hi> guide
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54867:25"/>
us into all <hi>saving Truth.</hi> All that is required of us, is this, that when we have once found this <hi>true Church,</hi> we presume no longer to <hi>judg</hi> for our selves, but <hi>captivate</hi> our <hi>Reason</hi> to the <hi>Infallible Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> This is something, and yet it seems but extorted from them, to make a little more <hi>plausible,</hi> what to me seems one of the greatest pieces of <hi>Folly</hi> in the World; I mean, the attempt of <hi>convincing</hi> men by <hi>Reason,</hi> who must not be allow'd to <hi>judg</hi> of the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> whereby they must be <hi>convinced.</hi> I find <hi>Reason,</hi> by a <hi>Traditionary Papist,</hi> compared to a <hi>dim-sighted Man, who used his Reason to find a trusty Friend to lead him in the Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and then reli'd on his Guidance rationally, without using his own Reason at all about the way it self.</hi> Thus are we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Reason</hi> to find out the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME, our <hi>sure Friend</hi> to <hi>guide</hi> us, and on whose <hi>Guidance</hi> we must <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Rely,</hi> after we have captivated our <hi>Reason</hi> to her, and for her sake have resolved to use it no more. But now, if this <hi>Reason,</hi> which is to direct us to our <hi>Guide,</hi> be such a <hi>dimsighted</hi> thing, and as we heard before, <hi>Hoodwink'd</hi> too, so that whilst we follow it, we can have no more hope, than only that we may <hi>possibly stumble</hi> into the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> who will secure us, that we shall not in this <hi>Twilight</hi> mistake a <hi>treacherous Enemy</hi> for a <hi>trusty Friend;</hi> and then, what shall we gain by our <hi>rational Reliance</hi> on him? A <hi>dimsighted</hi> Man in the <hi>Twilight,</hi> may easily <hi>mistake</hi> one thing for another, else should he not much need a <hi>trusty Guide;</hi> and why he may not <hi>mistake</hi> his <hi>Guide,</hi> as well as his <hi>Way,</hi> I do not yet know.</p>
               <p>But that I may be satisfied, how much I gain by this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral <hi>Concession,</hi> to use my <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>private Iudgment</hi> in inquiring after the <hi>true Church;</hi> I will a little consider, how the PAPIST is wont to talk with me, when he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade me to take his <hi>Church</hi> for my only sure <hi>Guide. First,</hi> he tells me, <hi>There is but one true Faith;</hi> and then, <hi>that this Faith must be held entirely;</hi> next, <hi>that this entire Faith is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54867:26"/>
to be found, but in the true Church.</hi> After this he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins again, and tells me, <hi>Christ hath a Church upon Earth;</hi> That <hi>there is but one true Church;</hi> That <hi>out of it there is no Salvation;</hi> and lastly, <hi>That the</hi> ROMAN <hi>Church, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is that one true Church out of which there is no Salvation.</hi> And till we have found that it is so, he will give us leave to <hi>judg</hi> for <hi>our selves.</hi> And I would thank him for this <hi>kindness,</hi> if he would allow me to enjoy the <hi>benefit</hi> of it, and to make any <hi>use</hi> of it; otherwise it will look but like a <hi>Mockery.</hi> I desire therefore some clear <hi>convincing Evidence,</hi> That the ROMAN <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>only true Church.</hi> He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not to this purpose, produce the <hi>Consent</hi> of all <hi>Christians,</hi> for <hi>two</hi> parts in <hi>three</hi> deny it. Therefore he gives me a great many <hi>Marks</hi> or <hi>Signs,</hi> sometimes <hi>more,</hi> sometimes <hi>fewer,</hi> whereby the <hi>only true Church</hi> must be known from others, and spends a great many words in shewing me how they agree to the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> and no other. That wherein I would next have same Satisfaction, is, supposing that all his <hi>Marks</hi> agree to the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> and no other; how I may know, that these are indeed the <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable Marks</hi> and <hi>Proprieties</hi> of the <hi>only true Church?</hi> To prove this, he betakes himself to the HOLY SCRIPTURE, and brings me thence some <hi>Texts,</hi> whereby he says, they are clearly proved to be so. I now, with a very hearty and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere desire to learn the <hi>Truth,</hi> and with all diligent use of such helps, as I can come by, <hi>read</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> all these <hi>Texts,</hi> and cannot discern in them any <hi>Evidenee</hi> at all of the thing which they are brought to <hi>prove;</hi> and therefore think it reasonable yet to call for some <hi>clearer proof.</hi> But now, when 'tis come to this, I presently find, that his <hi>liberal Concession</hi> to make <hi>use</hi> of my <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>private Iudgment</hi> to find out the <hi>true Church,</hi> amounts to no more than I at first suspected, that is just <hi>nothing:</hi> For here he retires to his <hi>Principle</hi> of PORERY, That I being a <hi>private Person,</hi> ought not to <hi>judg for my self,</hi> what is the <hi>Sense</hi> of those <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:54867:26"/>
but must submit my <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> to the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> (yea, even before I have <hi>found</hi> the <hi>Church)</hi> and without any <hi>dispute,</hi> receive the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> from her alone Thus he recals at once all that he had allow'd; and undoes again, whatsoever he had been adoing, to <hi>persuade</hi> me to his <hi>Communion.</hi> He was giving me <hi>Reasons,</hi> which might <hi>convince</hi> me in my <hi>Iudgment;</hi> and these at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve all into the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and yet, of this <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> I must not <hi>Iudg;</hi> and therefore by it I cannot be <hi>convinced</hi> of any thing, but this, that the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME is resolved to be <hi>Mistress</hi> of all <hi>Christians;</hi> and thinks it enough to <hi>convince</hi> us that she is so, if whilst she sets some of her <hi>Sons</hi> to hold us up in empty talk of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> to no purpose, she step out from behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, saying, <hi>Believe it, I am she.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I cannot possibly see, whatever others may do, (for I keep yet to my <hi>Protestant Principles</hi> of Judging for <hi>no man</hi> but <hi>my self)</hi> how I can embrace POPERY upon any <hi>convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> from PAPISTS; and I fear I must either take it <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Reason</hi> for it, or not at all. If I cannot know the RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN <hi>Church</hi> to be the only <hi>true Church,</hi> but by the <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of the SCRIPTURE; and if I cannot understand the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> of the SCRIPTURE, till I receive the true <hi>Sense</hi> of it from the ROMAN Church; and if I cannot take that for the true <hi>Sense</hi> of it, upon <hi>Her Declaration</hi> of it so to be, unless moved by her <hi>Authority,</hi> I must be persuaded to do the most <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing in the World, to my thinking; to believe a <hi>Church</hi> to be the <hi>only true Church,</hi> for her own <hi>Authority,</hi> which I yet know no more, than I do her to be the <hi>true Church;</hi> which, it is all along supposed, I do not know at all; This I think not only <hi>unreasonable,</hi> but <hi>impossible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must needs confess my self very hard to be persuaded of the tender goodness of that <hi>Mother,</hi> who, lest her Children should get hurt by the <hi>dimness</hi> of their <hi>sight,</hi> will needs pull out their <hi>Eyes,</hi> and keep them in her Pocket, till she has
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54867:27"/>
taught them to use them better. I am very loath to part with my <hi>Reason,</hi> how <hi>dimsighted</hi> soever, because I know not how to <hi>serve God</hi> without it. Yet if I should dare to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thus far, may I now have leave to take my <hi>rest</hi> here? If my <hi>dimsighted Reason</hi> help me to <hi>stumble</hi> into my <hi>Mother</hi>'s lap, may I yet think my self <hi>safe</hi> there? Not till I have learn'd her <hi>Charity</hi> too as well as her <hi>Faith,</hi> which the REPRESEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER tells us, <hi>She learn'd of Christ and his Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>Lastly,</hi> I must believe, that all other <hi>Christians</hi> but PAPISTS, are in a state of <hi>Damnation.</hi> The Decree of P. <hi>BONIFACE</hi> the VIIIth, as now it stands in the <hi>common Extravagants,</hi> is well known to be this, <hi>We declare, say, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, and pronounce, That it is altogether of necessity to</hi> SALVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, <hi>that every Creature be subject to the</hi> POPE of ROME. P. <hi>PIUS</hi> the II. in his <hi>Bull of Retractation,</hi> (tho he was not altogether of the same mind (as it seems) before, whilst he was <hi>Aeneas Sylvius)</hi> saith, <hi>He cannot be saved that doth not hold the Unity of the</hi> ROMAN <hi>Church.</hi> If so lusly a <hi>Decree,</hi> and so preremptory a <hi>Declaration</hi> of two POPES be too little, there is abundance more to this purpose to be met with, by him that has a mind to search for it: I only take notice at this time, that P. <hi>LEO</hi> the X<hi>th,</hi> in his <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> and his <hi>Bull</hi> therein read and pass'd, saith, <hi>We do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and approve that same Constitution (viz.</hi> of P. <hi>BONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FACE,</hi> but now mentioned), <hi>the present Sacred Council also approving it.</hi> And <hi>Lastly,</hi> P. <hi>PIUS</hi> the IV<hi>th,</hi> in his <hi>Bull,</hi> wherein he confirms the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>TRENT,</hi> imposeth an <hi>Oath</hi> upon <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Persons, wherein they swear, <hi>That the</hi> HOLY CATHOLICK <hi>and</hi> APOSTOLICK ROMAN <hi>Church, is the</hi> MOTHER <hi>and</hi> MISTRESS <hi>of all Churches; and that this is the true</hi> CATHOLICK FAITH, <hi>without which no man can be</hi> SAVED. Here's enough in all Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for us PROTESTANTS to <hi>hear,</hi> and too much a great deal (as I think) for any man to <hi>believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54867:27"/>
I think my self bound in <hi>Charity,</hi> to have the best Opinion I can of all men; and therefore I dare not think, that all they who are called ROMAN CATHOLICKS, have throughly learn'd this <hi>Doctrine.</hi> There seems to me to be so much of <hi>Ill-nature</hi> in it, that I should think my self the worst natur'd man in the World, if I could believe that any considerable numbers of them, besides the <hi>Priests,</hi> are guilty of it. Many <hi>piously</hi> disposed Souls, are not so happy, as to have always the <hi>clearest Understandings,</hi> or the <hi>sincerest Teachers,</hi> but have better <hi>Hearts</hi> than either <hi>Heads</hi> or <hi>Guides.</hi> Their <hi>Zeal</hi> is too great for both their <hi>opportunities</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> to <hi>consider;</hi> their <hi>earnestness</hi> of SALVATION, a thing very <hi>laudable</hi> in them, puts them into too much <hi>haste</hi> to <hi>deliberate</hi> long, and gives an advantage to some, who watch for it, to abuse them. Either a <hi>cunning</hi> JESUIT, or a <hi>canting</hi> FANA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICK, will hope to make an easy Prey of such Persons; for it matters not greatly of which sort the <hi>Tempter</hi> be, whilst the <hi>Temptation</hi> is the same: The <hi>Fish</hi> minds not the <hi>Fisher,</hi> but the <hi>Bait:</hi> Every <hi>Argument</hi> from either, is edged with a mighty <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Importunity,</hi> and sharpned with the <hi>sinest</hi> and most <hi>penetrating</hi> Expressions of a most tender <hi>Compassion</hi> for <hi>perishing Souls.</hi> SALVATION is as <hi>confidently</hi> promised, as <hi>earnestly</hi> desired; and whether it be to be had in the ROMANISTS <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> or in the SEPARATISTS <hi>purg'd</hi> and <hi>unmix'd Congregation,</hi> all's a case, when once the man is made to think it cannot be had in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND.</hi> If they who are so easily <hi>Proselyted</hi> either way, would take time to <hi>look</hi> before they <hi>leap,</hi> and could but see into the <hi>consequents</hi> of those very <hi>Arguments</hi> which most prevail with them, and are made the <hi>Traps</hi> to catch them in, they would <hi>stand off</hi> a little, and ask a few <hi>Questions</hi> more, for their better Satisfaction; before they could endure to think of entring into a <hi>Communion,</hi> which would oblige them, as ever they hope to be <hi>saved</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to believe that CHRIST hath no faithful <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:54867:28"/>
upon Earth, but a few <hi>Subjects</hi> of the POPE of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can easily perceive, by divers <hi>Books</hi> written by them who call themselves <hi>Converts,</hi> that the main <hi>Motive</hi> of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over to the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> was this, That they could not hope to be <hi>saved</hi> in any other: And I find that most <hi>Arguments</hi> of late used, to persuade us to that <hi>Religion,</hi> look the very same way; And it is this <hi>Doctrine</hi> alone, that hath put me upon this <hi>Enquiry</hi> for my <hi>own Satisfaction:</hi> For I must needs confess, that this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which some acount so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a <hi>Persuasive</hi> to <hi>Popery,</hi> has always with me had the quite <hi>contrary effect</hi> to what I find it hath in them; and has been, and is at this present to me, as strong a <hi>Dissuasive</hi> from it. If I can never be a PAPIST, till I can <hi>believe</hi> it, I am very confident, I shall never be one. I would leave the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> the next Minute, should she require of me to <hi>believe, that all out of her Communion were in a state of Damnation;</hi> and truly I think that most PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS are of my mind.</p>
               <p>When therefore I found the REPRESENTER in good earnest to vindicate his <hi>Church</hi> in this one Point, I presently concluded, that he had writ his <hi>whole Book</hi> to no purpose; for let him spend all his <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Colours</hi> in painting POPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY to the best advantage, so long as this one <hi>Spot</hi> appears in her <hi>Face,</hi> she may possibly seem in her new Dress <hi>less ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,</hi> but not one jot <hi>more lovely.</hi> Having told us, <hi>That no one can arrive to the true knowledg of the Catholick Faith, but by receiving it as proposed and believed by the Church of</hi> CHRIST; <hi>and that the</hi> ROMAN CATHOLICK <hi>is the only true Church; that whosoever denies any Article of her Faith, denies so much of</hi> CHRIST's <hi>Doctrine; That whosoever hears Her, hears</hi> CHRIST; <hi>and whosoever obstinately and wilfully is separated from Her, is in the same distance separated from</hi> CHRIST <hi>himself;</hi> and finally, <hi>That God addeth to this Church daily, such as shall be saved:</hi> He hath told us enough to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54867:28"/>
persuade us, that no PROTESTANT in the World could have done that <hi>Church</hi> a greater <hi>diskindness,</hi> than he hath done; nor by any <hi>Misrepresentation</hi> of her, have worse <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented</hi> her.</p>
               <p>When the PAPISTS are pleas'd to ask us that <hi>unanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Question,</hi> as they account it, <hi>Where was your Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> LUTHER? They wish us withal, to take into our <hi>Serious Consideration,</hi> the <hi>state</hi> of our <hi>Forefathers,</hi> who lived and died in the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ROME;</hi> asking us, if we dare think, that they were all <hi>damn'd:</hi> We need not trouble our heads with shaping an <hi>Answer</hi> to so <hi>frivolous</hi> a <hi>Question,</hi> because we durst never yet be so hardy as to affirm, that all are <hi>damn'd,</hi> who live and die in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ROME;</hi> but do openly declare to the World, that tho we think our own <hi>Religion</hi> the safest, yet many of that <hi>Communion</hi> have been heretofore, and many also are at this day, under such <hi>Circumstances,</hi> as encourage us to hope very well of them as to their <hi>future state.</hi> However if it so well deserve our Consideration, what's become of our <hi>Forefathers?</hi> doth it not as well deserve the Consideration of the ROMANISTS, what is become of many of <hi>theirs?</hi> Yea, What will become of the greatest part of the <hi>Christian World,</hi> who live and die out of their <hi>Communion?</hi> And if they would have us think the <hi>worse</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> left by thinking well of it, we should be wanting in <hi>Charity</hi> to our <hi>Fathers,</hi> which yet we are by it no way obliged to be; should it not move them to think the <hi>worse</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains them to think <hi>so uncharitably,</hi> not only of their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> but of all the <hi>World</hi> but themselves only?</p>
               <p>How many most Eminent and Worthy <hi>Persons,</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great and famous <hi>Churches,</hi> must I be obliged, by embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>ROMAN Faith,</hi> to believe excluded from SALVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION? Upon these terms, I cannot see how 'tis possible for me to be <hi>Reconciled</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ROME,</hi> without profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my self an <hi>irreconcileable Enemy</hi> to all the <hi>Christian

World</hi> besides. I must turn <hi>Hector,</hi> and call all other <hi>Christians, damn'd Hereticks.</hi> I must needs say, this appears not to me, like that <hi>Meek</hi> and <hi>Lamb like Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Blessed</hi> JESUS, which is given by him to his <hi>Dove-like Spouse,</hi> that thus <hi>Rants</hi> it in his pretended <hi>Vicars,</hi> and their Adherents.

               <p>I must make nothing of condemning all PROTESTANTS and PROTESTANT <hi>Churches,</hi> of what other <hi>Denomination</hi> soever; and these alone are no inconsiderable part of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: These Hereticks</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmin) possess many and ample Provinces, ENGLAND, SCOTLAND,</hi> (and why not <hi>IRELAND?)

               <p>Farther yet, I find that the <hi>African Council,</hi> but now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, did alledg for it self the <hi>Sixth Canon</hi> of the <hi>First Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council</hi> held at NICE, which is this, <hi>Let the old Custom be kept through</hi> Aegypt, Lybia <hi>and</hi> Pentapolis, <hi>so that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> ALEXANDRIA <hi>have power over all these, because the Bishop of</hi> ROME <hi>hath also the like Custom.</hi> By this <hi>Canon</hi> these <hi>two Bishops</hi> seem to be made equal in <hi>Power.</hi> In the <hi>Fourth General Council</hi> held at <hi>Calcedon,</hi> and <hi>Ninth Canon,</hi> it is orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That if any</hi> Bishop <hi>or</hi> Clerk <hi>have a Controversie with the</hi> Metropolitan <hi>of that Province, they have recourse to the</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>of the</hi> Diocese, <hi>or certainly to the See of the Royal City

This I am apt to think a very daring matter, and not rashly to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.

And truly they seem to me, whatever men of more <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> may think, little less than <hi>Insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> And yet after all this, if I may be convinced that the <hi>Authority</hi> of the ROMAN <hi>Church</hi> hath sufficient grounds of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> to support it, I must confess no <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> in my way ought to dishearten me from breaking through it. But then again, if I must believe that there is such an <hi>uncontrollable Power</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> in some <hi>One Church,</hi> in the ROMAN <hi>Church</hi> by name, yea, in the <hi>Bishop</hi> of that <hi>Church;</hi> and if I must so believe this, that I must not leave in my Soul any room at all for the least <hi>Charitable thought</hi> of any man's <hi>Salvation,</hi> who believes it not: I think it no less than needful, that I have the <hi>Clearest</hi> and most <hi>undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the World for what I believe, lest the Sentence of <hi>Condemnation</hi> should <hi>recoil</hi> upon my self for my <hi>Temerity</hi> and <hi>Uncharitableness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed if this <hi>Church</hi> may be allow'd to bear <hi>witness</hi> to its own <hi>Authority,</hi> and such a <hi>Testimony</hi> be <hi>sufficient,</hi> I cannot want it. The <hi>Council</hi> of TRENT hath more than once call'd her, the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Mistriss</hi> of all <hi>Churches.</hi> So <hi>Infallible</hi> in her <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Directions,</hi> so <hi>Absolute</hi> in her <hi>Dominion</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54867:31"/>
and <hi>Command</hi> she must be, that Her <hi>sole Authority</hi> must be warrant enough, and nothing else any warrant without it, for all things that belong to <hi>Christian Religion. Whosoever</hi> (saith <hi>Becanus</hi> in his <hi>Compendium) in matters of Faith and Religion followeth the true Church of Christ</hi> (which he there proveth to be the <hi>Roman Church</hi> only) <hi>cannot err about Faith and Religion, seeing the true Church of Christ is Infallible.</hi> And this we are told continually, as this <hi>Iesuit</hi> doth say, <hi>that this is the shortest Compendium of all Controversies.</hi> This then being to support the whole <hi>Fabrick</hi> of POPERY, had need to stand on <hi>firm</hi> ground.</p>
               <p>This <hi>ground</hi> I would now fain discover. Why then must we believe that the ROMAN <hi>Church</hi> hath this <hi>Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> in <hi>Religion?</hi> I must confess my self one of those stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that cannot believe without <hi>Reason.</hi> When I hear that <hi>Church</hi> telling me, she is <hi>Infallible,</hi> and hath all <hi>Power</hi> over all other <hi>Churches;</hi> I cannot believe it till I have some better <hi>reason</hi> for it than this, That She must be all that, which She is pleased to say of her self; and therefore must be <hi>Infallible</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent too,</hi> if She say it. And I am a little troubled to say, that this is all I can get out of her for my satisfaction, lest even PROTESTANTS should think I say <hi>incredible</hi> things of her, and that I have no other design, but to make all the <hi>Learned</hi> Men of her <hi>Communion</hi> seem <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,</hi> in talking to us as to <hi>Children,</hi> always <hi>childishly.</hi> But it is not in my <hi>power,</hi> to make their <hi>Arguments</hi> better than they are; nor <hi>Civil</hi> in me to teach them what to say; and I am sure my <hi>Temporal Interest</hi> cannot at this time tempt me to oversee the <hi>strength</hi> of their <hi>Reasons.</hi> The very best <hi>Reasons</hi> I have yet met with, with how much <hi>Artifice</hi> and <hi>Sophistry</hi> soever they are dress'd up, amount to no <hi>more,</hi> nor <hi>better,</hi> in my opinion, than her own <hi>honest Word,</hi> that is, her own <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> for proof of her <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility;</hi> and therefore I must either believe them <hi>both,</hi> before I can believe them, even whilst I am <hi>enquiring</hi> for a <hi>reason</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:54867:32"/>
why I should <hi>believe</hi> them, or I must not believe them at all, nor with her consent be saved.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Missionaries</hi> tell us, they are willing to undergo any <hi>Pains</hi> or <hi>Difficulty</hi> to rescue us from damning <hi>Error;</hi> and whilst they proceed in this <hi>Method,</hi> I have cause to believe them; for I am confident, to prove their <hi>Church</hi> hath this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> they contend for, is as great a <hi>Difficulty</hi> as they can meet with. If they should here offer us (what is so much talk'd of by them) the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> there is nothing more plain, than that they do but <hi>Mock</hi> us. For this can be nothing else but the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME's <hi>Testimony</hi> for her own <hi>Authority.</hi> It cannot, I say, be any thing else, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the thing they are proving is, <hi>That She alone is the</hi> One, Holy, Catholick <hi>and</hi> Apostolick <hi>Church:</hi> And were it any thing else, they would never discover it to us, because they would thereby give us an <hi>unanswerable Argument</hi> against what they would prove her to be; for if they will shew us any other <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> by the <hi>Testimony</hi> whereof Her <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> may be proved, we are thereby enabled to prove <hi>She</hi> is not the <hi>Only true Church out of which there is no Salvation.</hi> What then can this <hi>Testimony</hi> be? Is it that of the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> Ages of the <hi>Church</hi> before POPERY was brought forth? Not so to be sure, for POPERY was (they say) from the <hi>beginning,</hi> and glorieth of her <hi>Antiquity</hi> above all things. Is it the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>all others</hi> in the World that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess <hi>Christianity?</hi> It cannot be, for all these, if not of her <hi>Communion,</hi> are <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and in a state of <hi>Damnation</hi> for denying her <hi>Authority;</hi> and were it possible for them to <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> that to be which they <hi>deny</hi> to be, yet is their <hi>Testimony invalid,</hi> because they confess themselves <hi>Fallible,</hi> and this point of <hi>Faith</hi> cannot stand upon a <hi>fallible Testimony.</hi> By this 'tis very clear to me, that the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> if it be produced for the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME, can be nothing else but the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME's own <hi>Word;</hi> and I never doubted, but she hath a <hi>good word</hi> for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54867:32"/>
her self, any more than I doubt lest it should be thought a <hi>good proof</hi> of her <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have heard again much talk of <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ROMAM CATHOLICKS; but if they alledg this for their <hi>Church's Authority,</hi> they give us only the same thing again in other Words. <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> can be nothing else but the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Universal Church,</hi> and that must be the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME; and so we are not advanced one step farther than we were before. The Credit we are to give unto <hi>Universal Tradition,</hi> depends on the <hi>Authority</hi> of the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> which we have not yet <hi>sound,</hi> but are <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring</hi> after.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> be brought in to <hi>Witness</hi> this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> all the noise they make will prove but the <hi>Voice</hi> of the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> crying her self up for the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the World, and thundring <hi>Anathema</hi> to all that will not fall down and worship her. Will she abide by the <hi>Testimony</hi> of either <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> if they speak not what she has taught them, or against what she holds? Or shall they be allow'd to over rule the <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Tradition</hi> of the <hi>present Church of</hi> ROME? Are <hi>Councils</hi> of any <hi>Credit</hi> more than the POPE's <hi>Confirmation</hi> gives them? And are single <hi>Fathers</hi> of more <hi>Credit</hi> than they? If not, we have yet no more but her <hi>own Word</hi> for her <hi>own Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they bring us SCRIPTURE to prove this <hi>Authority,</hi> I must say, that as we reverence <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> so we <hi>adore</hi> (with <hi>Tertullian) the fulness of the</hi> SCRIPTURE, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we desire any better <hi>Proof,</hi> than its <hi>Testimony.</hi> Yet when I consider how these men use the SCRIPTURE; I am at a stand to think, how they can in good earnest produce it as a <hi>Witness</hi> in this matter; for after they have said almost all the <hi>ill</hi> they can of it, calling it <hi>imperfect, insufficient, obscure, unsens'd;</hi> they seem to <hi>ridicule</hi> both <hi>it</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> when they bring it forth, thus <hi>disabled,</hi> for a <hi>Witness.</hi> Do not they tell us again and again, that both the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Sense</hi> of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54867:33"/>
SCRIPTURE, depend, as to us, on the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of their <hi>Church?</hi> And can its <hi>Testimony</hi> then possibly amount to any more than that <hi>Church's bare Word?</hi> Do not they deny us a <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>Discretion,</hi> whereby we should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for ourselves, whether it speak <hi>fÃ³r</hi> or <hi>against</hi> their <hi>Church's Authority?</hi> And will they yet produce it to convince us of the <hi>Authority</hi> by which alone we are both to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> it? It cannot be produced to <hi>convince</hi> us in our <hi>Iudgment,</hi> for we are not allow'd any use of our <hi>Iudgment</hi> in the Case. It must be only to <hi>convince themselves</hi> that we are <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and I dare say, that may be done without the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as well as with it, whilst their <hi>Church</hi> must give the <hi>Sense</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>But because they know we magnify it, they will <hi>produce</hi> it, tho I cannot see to what other end, than to persuade us to take heed of <hi>trusting</hi> too <hi>much</hi> to it, or thinking it worth any thing, after it hath shew'd us the <hi>true Church.</hi> It must be believ'd no longer than it is <hi>authorized</hi> to speak by that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> which is to be <hi>proved</hi> by it; so that by shewing us that <hi>Authority,</hi> it loseth all its own <hi>Authority</hi> for ever. <hi>For this</hi> (saith <hi>Stapleton) that God hath commanded us to believe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Stapleton <hi>Tripl. c.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>the Church, we do not hang our Faith on the Authority of the Church, as upon the proper and sole cause of this Belief, but partly on manifest Scriptures, by which we are remitted to the teaching of the Church; partly on the Creed,</hi> &amp;c. This then is the end of <hi>producing</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that we may be <hi>convinced</hi> by it, that we are no longer to <hi>learn</hi> of it, after we are once brought by it to the knowledg of the <hi>Church's Authority,</hi> but thenceforward are to depend wholly upon the <hi>teaching</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> unto which it <hi>remits</hi> us. All the <hi>use</hi> then that we have of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> is to be <hi>guided</hi> by it to the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME (tho it cannot do so much for us neither, but as that <hi>Church guides it);</hi> and having thank'd it for its kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we are then to bid it good Night.</p>
               <p>Now seeing <hi>manifest Scriptures</hi> are promised us, to guide us to the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> I think it reasonable to expect,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54867:33"/>
that they produce such <hi>Scriptures</hi> as are more <hi>manifest</hi> to us, than their <hi>Church's Authority,</hi> which is to be proved by them; seeing it is by their <hi>Evidence</hi> I am to be <hi>convinced</hi> of that, which as yet is <hi>unevident</hi> to me. Neither ought the <hi>Sense</hi> of these <hi>manifest Scriptures</hi> depend upon the <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> whereof they are brought to <hi>prove,</hi> as a thing to me not yet <hi>evident;</hi> for so, I shall be still but where I was before; and instead of <hi>manifest Scriptures,</hi> be shuffled off with the <hi>Church's bare Word;</hi> I mean, with such <hi>Interpretations</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as I have no reason to receive, but by that <hi>Authority</hi> whereof I am yet, at least, in doubt.</p>
               <p>Now, that there are indeed no such <hi>manifest Scriptures,</hi> I am reasonably well assured before-hand. I have read the <hi>Scripture</hi> over and over, and find not the least mention therein made of this <hi>Authority</hi> of the ROMAN <hi>Church.</hi> The POPE of ROME, or his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> is never once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the beginning of the <hi>Bible</hi> to the end; nor can I meet with one <hi>Syllable</hi> touching either the <hi>Infallibility</hi> or <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> or his <hi>Councils,</hi> or of any kind of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> due to <hi>either,</hi> from all <hi>Christians.</hi> I cannot so much as find there, that ever there was any <hi>Bishop</hi> of ROME, or that there <hi>should</hi> be any there <hi>afterwards,</hi> much less that all <hi>Christians</hi> are to own that <hi>Bishop</hi> for their <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Christ's Vicar.</hi> And finding nothing of all this, I must needs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how <hi>manifest Scriptures</hi> should be produced, to prove this <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> over all Churches. And yet, if there be such an <hi>Authority,</hi> and if it be so <hi>necessary</hi> for all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> it, and <hi>submit</hi> unto it; I cannot but think that it ought to have been as <hi>manifestly</hi> declared in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as any other point whatsoever. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in whom this <hi>Authority</hi> is said to have been first setled, saith not a word of it in his <hi>Epistles.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> who should in all reason have been best acquainted with it, says nothing at all of it. To the <hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54867:34"/>
which the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME makes to be much <hi>inferior</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Authority,</hi> they both teach us our Duty; and strange it is, if they knew of any such thing, that they should not as plainly instruct us in our Duty to the POPE or <hi>Church</hi> of ROME wherein our <hi>Salvation,</hi> the main thing they were to take care for, is so deeply concern'd.</p>
               <p>But what are these <hi>manifest Scriptures</hi> at length? I find our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> saying to St. <hi>Peter</hi> (Matt. 16. 18.) <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. but I find not that all this, whatever it may signify, was <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly</hi> said to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of ROME. <hi>The plain and obvious Sense</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmin) of these words is, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De Rom. Pont. l. 1. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>the Primary of the whole Church to be promised to Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>under two Metaphors.</hi> And yet, by all the <hi>Light</hi> that he is able to afford me, I cannot discern in these words, whatever was promised to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> much less the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of ROME over all <hi>Churches.</hi> And it is no wonder if a <hi>Protestant Heretick</hi> be so blind, when such eminent Persons as <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Austin,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary, Ambrose, Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Cyril,</hi> could no more see it than I, as the learned <hi>Cardinal</hi> himself there confesseth. Nay, here's not a word to assure us, that this <hi>Rock</hi> must needs be a <hi>Monarch</hi> invested with a <hi>Supremacy</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> over the whole <hi>Church,</hi> or that this <hi>Monarch</hi> must needs be the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of ROME, or that the <hi>Gates of Hell shall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against the</hi> ROMAN <hi>Church;</hi> for all this, we must be beholden to that <hi>Church's own Word,</hi> or we shall never find it in this place.</p>
               <p>I find again, that <hi>Christ</hi> commanded St. <hi>Peter</hi> (Joh. 21. 16.) to <hi>feed his Sheep,</hi> and <hi>his Lambs;</hi> as indeed it is the Duty of all <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to do; and both St. <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Pet</hi> 5. 2.) and St. <hi>Paul (Acts</hi> 20. 28.) tell us as much; and so much the apter am I to doubt, whether the POPE be so
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54867:34"/>
much as a <hi>good Pastor</hi> of <hi>Christ's Sheep</hi> or no, seeing he takes so little care to <hi>Feed,</hi> and so much to <hi>Fleece</hi> them. I am sure I read of no more but one <hi>chief Shepherd,</hi> and <hi>Bishop of Souls,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, is <hi>Christ</hi> JESUS himself, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 25. The <hi>Apostles</hi> were all <hi>Shepherds</hi> under <hi>Him;</hi> but where is this <hi>manifest Scripture</hi> to shew that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was made <hi>Head-Shepherd,</hi> with Commission to <hi>Feed</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> too, not only the <hi>Sheep,</hi> but the <hi>Shepherds</hi> also? But especially, where is the <hi>Commission</hi> given to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of ROME successively for ever, to <hi>govern</hi> the whole <hi>Flock</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> with <hi>Soveraign Authority? Feed</hi> the <hi>whole,</hi> I am sure he neither doth, nor can.</p>
               <p>Many <hi>great</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> things (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us) are said of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> and very <hi>deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> for he was a very <hi>great</hi> and <hi>eminent Apostle.</hi> But the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> never saith, That he was a great <hi>Monarch,</hi> nor that he was <hi>Bishop</hi> of ROME, nor that he had a <hi>Throne,</hi> or but a <hi>Chair</hi> there; and least of all, that this <hi>Imaginary Monarchy</hi> was to descend unto the next <hi>Bishop</hi> of ROME, and to his <hi>Successors</hi> for ever; and that St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who long out-lived St. <hi>Peter,</hi> became thereby <hi>subject</hi> to some of those <hi>Bishops,</hi> which did not well suit with the <hi>Dignity</hi> of an <hi>Apostle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I read those words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 21. <hi>The head can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say to the feet, I have no need of you.</hi> But that the POPE is the <hi>Head,</hi> and all <hi>Christians, Kings,</hi> as well as others, the <hi>Feet;</hi> I may possibly read in some such <hi>Iesuit</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> but I am sure I shall never read it in the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many more such parcels of <hi>Scripture</hi> as these, they give us; but after the most serious perusal of them all, I profess I cannot find any thing like <hi>manifest Scripture</hi> for the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the ROMAN <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore it seems yet as plain to me, as that <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>Three</hi> make <hi>Five,</hi> that the <hi>bare Word</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> without any kind of solid <hi>Proof,</hi> is all that she hath to shew for her <hi>Authority.</hi> She says great things of <hi>her self,</hi> and talks sometimes of <hi>Scripture,</hi> but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54867:35"/>
much more of <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Universal Tradition,</hi> and indeed every thing that's <hi>Venerable;</hi> but when all is <hi>spell'd</hi> and <hi>put together,</hi> 'tis but the <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the <hi>present Church,</hi> that is, her own very <hi>confident Asseveration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we have a little <hi>Scripture</hi> for Fashion's sake, we must take it as she hath taught it to speak in her own <hi>Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> which the <hi>Council</hi> of TRENT was even then pleas'd to make the only <hi>Authentick Translation,</hi> when it was confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly very <hi>faulty,</hi> and hath been since that divers times cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. And then we must take it in her own <hi>Sense</hi> too, tho we know not well where we may be sure to find it. Her <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Doctors</hi> she will not allow us to trust for it, nor indeed do we find them any better agreed about it, than others are, only they have for the most part either the <hi>Modesty</hi> or <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to refer all to the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>Mother Church,</hi> could they but tell us where to find it; for she is loath, once for all, in some <hi>publick Comment,</hi> or <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to tell us what it is. If we may be allow'd to hear the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> she must stand at their <hi>Elbows,</hi> and <hi>prompt</hi> them what to say; we must have them in her own approved <hi>Editions;</hi> and if they have been at <hi>School</hi> long enough in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> or some <hi>Religious House,</hi> 'tis probable they were reasonably well instructed in her own <hi>Language,</hi> before they were allow'd to go abroad again. However, ere they pass the <hi>Press,</hi> an <hi>Expurgatory Index</hi> can teach them either to <hi>Speak,</hi> or to be <hi>Silent,</hi> as she thinks most <hi>seasonable. Councils</hi> may be heard, but only such as have his <hi>Holiness's stamp</hi> upon them; and how we can understand them any better than the <hi>Scripture,</hi> till he <hi>Interprets</hi> for us, is hard to say. So that all returns to this still, That we have her <hi>honest Word</hi> for her <hi>Authority;</hi> and this is the <hi>sole Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that I can discover of this <hi>prodigious Faith,</hi> which we must all <hi>have,</hi> or else <hi>perish</hi> eternally.</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:54867:35"/>
III. And now, in the <hi>last</hi> place, seeing it is come to this, for ought I see, that I must rest upon her <hi>own Word,</hi> or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for the <hi>Truth</hi> of her <hi>Sovereign Authority,</hi> and must upon peril of my own <hi>Damnation,</hi> take upon me this <hi>invidious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> to believe all men <hi>damn'd</hi> but PAPISTS, that I may enjoy the <hi>Blessing</hi> of my <hi>Mother;</hi> I should be glad to know, that <hi>She her-self</hi> (as <hi>Infallible</hi> as she is) could but <hi>probably</hi> assure me, where this <hi>Word</hi> of her's may certainly be <hi>found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The REPRESENTER indeed (in his <hi>confident</hi> way) hath told me, <hi>That all the Members of his Religion (however spread through the World) agree like one man in every Article of their Faith.</hi> And if we would know for our learning, by what happy <hi>means</hi> this wonderful <hi>Agreement</hi> is effected, he tells us, <hi>It is by an equal Submission to the Determinations of their Church;</hi> that is, as I understand it, by taking her <hi>bare Word</hi> for every thing. <hi>No one of them</hi> (saith he) <hi>tho the most learned and wise, ever following any other Rule in their Faith besides this, of unanimously believing as the Church of God</hi> (or ROMAN <hi>Church) believes.</hi> And if this be so, I wonder to what purpose their <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> can serve them, any more than their <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Wit,</hi> which they have <hi>renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> and <hi>deposed.</hi> However, if this be true <hi>Representing,</hi> I shall not, I hope, find it difficult to find out the <hi>Church's Word</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> on which my <hi>Faith</hi> must stand. Every <hi>Member</hi> of it, tho he have no more than the <hi>old Collier's Faith,</hi> can help me to it in any part of the World, for all <hi>agree</hi> like <hi>one Man</hi> in <hi>every Article,</hi> and therefore sure in this most <hi>fundamental</hi> one. But what now shall I think af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, if it should so fall out, that hardly <hi>one</hi> in a <hi>hundred</hi> of these <hi>Members</hi> know either <hi>where</hi> this <hi>Church</hi> of theirs is to be <hi>found,</hi> or what those <hi>Determinations</hi> of hers are, unto which they so <hi>unanimously</hi> submit? Nay, what if their <hi>Church</hi> it self cannot tell them this? When <hi>She</hi> hath said all She can, to inform both <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> suppose it be still <hi>two</hi> to <hi>one,</hi> that we shall be <hi>mistaken</hi> in it, whatever we take to be
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54867:36"/>
the ROMAN <hi>Church,</hi> or her <hi>infallible Word?</hi> This is it, that I am now, for a <hi>Close,</hi> to <hi>inquire</hi> into.</p>
               <p>It must needs seem more than a little absurd, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, to tye a man under pain of <hi>Damnation,</hi> to believe he knows not what, and what no body can certainly shew him; I mean, a <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ROME,</hi> which all men deny, but they of her <hi>Communion;</hi> and about which, even they who are of her <hi>Communion,</hi> are so <hi>divided</hi> among themselves, that I do not see how ever they can <hi>agree</hi> about it. Is there no <hi>Dispute</hi> in that <hi>Church</hi> about this <hi>Power?</hi> Have they not been even at Daggers drawing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about it? Is the <hi>Controversie</hi> yet decided? Or can any one promise me that it ever shall? <hi>There is a great Diversity among the Schoolmen</hi> (saith our REPRESENTER) <hi>in their Divinity-Points, and Opinions of such matters as are no Articles of Faith, and have no relation to it, but as some Circumstance or Manner, which being never defined by the Church, may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd severally, either this way, or that way, without any breach of Faith, or injury to their Religion.</hi> I will not stay here to ask him, what greater <hi>diversity</hi> he can find amongst the <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> than he here grants to be amongst PAPISTS; nor why our <hi>Divisions</hi> being no greater than <hi>theirs,</hi> nor more nearly related to any <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> should be less consistent with the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> (as is commonly objected against us) than <hi>theirs</hi> are: But I ask, whether the <hi>Supreme Authority</hi> of the <hi>ROMAN Church,</hi> be an <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>ROMAN Faith,</hi> or no? And again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> be as one <hi>man</hi> unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously agreed about it, or no? He will say, it may be, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Article</hi> they are, as to the <hi>Substance</hi> of it, tho not as to all <hi>Circumstances:</hi> But now if it appear, that these <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the <hi>Power</hi> about which they <hi>differ,</hi> are such as the thing it self will be as good as nothing without them; or if they be not as <hi>certainly known</hi> and <hi>believ'd,</hi> as the <hi>Power</hi> it self, I think it will follow, that all their <hi>agreement</hi> about
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54867:36"/>
the <hi>Thing,</hi> is as good as nothing too, till these <hi>Circumstances</hi> be also <hi>agreed</hi> upon.</p>
               <p>Thus it is then; I must for my <hi>Salvation</hi> believe that, there is such a thing as a <hi>Supreme Power</hi> over <hi>all Churches,</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ROME;</hi> and in this all PAPISTS as <hi>one man</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously <hi>agree;</hi> but about the Circumstances of this Power, there is a great <hi>diversity</hi> of <hi>Opinions</hi> among them; yet is this no injury to their <hi>Religion.</hi> Tho without a better <hi>agreement</hi> about these Circumstances, no man (in my opinion) can be able to satisfie me, what their <hi>Religion</hi> is; for these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances about which they differ, are no more but such <hi>inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable</hi> things as these, <hi>Whence</hi> this <hi>Power</hi> is; whether it be of <hi>God,</hi> or of <hi>Men;</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Human Right</hi> only; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it extends over all the <hi>World,</hi> or over all <hi>Christians</hi> only; to <hi>Spiritual</hi> concerns only, or to <hi>Temporals</hi> also; <hi>where</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides and is lodg'd; in the <hi>Church-Diffusive,</hi> or all <hi>Christians,</hi> especially the <hi>Pastors;</hi> or in the <hi>Church-Representative,</hi> or <hi>General Councils;</hi> or in the <hi>Church Virtual,</hi> or the POPE of <hi>ROME.</hi> These <hi>petty</hi> Circumstances they <hi>differ</hi> about, and the Church it self knows not how to <hi>agree</hi> them; but what's all this to the <hi>Article</hi> it self, most firmly believ'd by all, that is, a <hi>Supreme Power in the</hi> Church? All their <hi>Religion</hi> rests on the <hi>Determinations</hi> of their Church; all the <hi>force</hi> of these <hi>Determinations</hi> to oblige the <hi>Faith</hi> of men, depend on this <hi>Supreme Power;</hi> May not a man, however, well enough be assured of his <hi>Religion,</hi> tho no man can tell him, <hi>Whence</hi> this <hi>Power</hi> is, Over <hi>what</hi> it is, or <hi>Where</hi> it is? Indeed, what other men can do, I know not; but for my own part, I must needs think it a very hard matter to believe this <hi>Power,</hi> and to have any <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> founded on this <hi>Power,</hi> without some better Information about these Circumstances of it; and therefore before I can yield to be of that <hi>Religion,</hi> I must beseech that Church, which will not allow us to be <hi>saved,</hi> without an <hi>absolute Submission</hi> and <hi>Resignation</hi> of our selves to her <hi>Authority,</hi> to tell us, if not <hi>Whence</hi> (which is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54867:37"/>
yet the most material Circumstance of all the rest) yet, at least, <hi>What</hi> and <hi>Where</hi> it is.</p>
               <p>There is challeng'd by this Church, a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>over-ruling</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> by her <hi>Infallible Iudgment,</hi> and a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding our Obedience</hi> by her <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> It will therefore concern me to ask, How I may be rightly inform'd in both these great branches of her <hi>Power,</hi> unto which my <hi>subjection</hi> is required upon pain of <hi>Damnation.</hi>
               </p>

She claims a <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Interpreting</hi> or giving the certain <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> of <hi>Iudging</hi> and finally <hi>Deciding</hi> all <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies</hi> of Religion, of <hi>peremptorily Defining</hi> and <hi>Determining</hi> in all matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religious Practice;</hi> so that all are bound, without any further <hi>dispute</hi> or search, to <hi>submit</hi> to all her <hi>Determinations</hi> and <hi>Decrees.</hi> INFALLIBLE then, we must believe this <hi>Church</hi> to be, and that she cannot <hi>Err</hi> in her <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners:</hi> And yet where this INFALLIBILITY is to be <hi>found,</hi> is a <hi>Question</hi> she is not to this day able to <hi>resolve:</hi> In short, I find that this <hi>Infallible</hi> Church, which tells us that she cannot <hi>Err,</hi> when she is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to make this apparent to the World, can tell us certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both <hi>How,</hi> and in <hi>What</hi> she <hi>can Err;</hi> and in this I doubt not, but she is <hi>Infallible</hi> enough; but <hi>who</hi> they are in all her Communion, or in <hi>what things</hi> it is, that they <hi>cannot err,</hi> this she could never tell us <hi>certainly,</hi> and yet it is <hi>this alone</hi> that can make her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> (if she have it) to be of any use to us.</p>
               <p>The REPRESENTER saith, <hi>That the</hi> PAPIST <hi>believes that the Pastors and Prelates of his Church, are Fallible; that there is none of them</hi> (and yet the POPE is one of them, and COUNCILS are made up of them) <hi>but may fall into Errors, Heresy and Schism, and consequently are subject to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.</hi> And further he tells us, <hi>That tho some allow the</hi> POPE <hi>the assistance of a Divine Infallibility, without being in a General Council; yet he is satisfied 'tis only their Opinion, and not their Faith, there being no obligation from the Church, of assenting to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54867:37"/>
any such Doctrine.</hi> And tho he maintain the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> of General Councils <hi>lawfully Assembled,</hi> yet is it not so plain, whether he count them <hi>infallible</hi> or no, by what he says in that Chapter of Councils. This we are told, <hi>That if any thing contrary to what Christ taught, and his Apostles, should be defined and commanded to be believed, even by ten thousand Councils, he believes it damnable in any one to receive it.</hi> But in the following Chapter, he speaks out, and says, That <hi>by the Assistance of the Holy Ghost, they are specially protected from all Error, in all Definitions and Declarations in matters of Faith:</hi> And this is true, tho he grants it possible, that the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> there <hi>assembled,</hi> may be <hi>proud, ignorant, covetous, enormous sinners, and infamous for other vices, and at other times may prevaricate, make Innovations in Faith, and teach erroneous Doctrines.</hi> Now a man would think, That if all the <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> of the <hi>Flock</hi> (not <hi>one</hi> excepted) may <hi>err,</hi> then the <hi>Sheep,</hi> which are bound to follow their <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi> may <hi>err</hi> also; and if the <hi>Fallible</hi> lead the <hi>Fallible,</hi> 'tis not <hi>impossible</hi> for both to <hi>err;</hi> and who it is that is <hi>infallible,</hi> is hard to see. And again, seeing he tells us, <hi>That Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the care of his Flock to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>and that the</hi> POPE <hi>or Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>is in this charge, St.</hi> Peter'<hi>s Successor, and that God assists those who have this charge, with a particular helping Grace, such as has a special respect to the Office and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that such as was given to the Prophets, and to</hi> Moses, <hi>when he was made a God to</hi> Pharoah. I cannot see, but it must be as consequent to all this, that the POPE should be <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as that a <hi>General Council</hi> is so, especially when it is his <hi>Approbation</hi> that gives <hi>force</hi> to its <hi>Decrees.</hi> Moreover, it is not easy to believe that <hi>God</hi> hath made a promise of <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Assistance</hi> to any number of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> who are no better <hi>qualified,</hi> than he supposes they may most of them be, with <hi>Pride, Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Vice, Turbulence</hi> and <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and assembled, it may be, under an <hi>Heretical Pope,</hi> (for such, 'tis granted he may be) and as <hi>vicious</hi> too, and

However, there are <hi>two</hi> things which make it very hard to find out this <hi>Infalliblility,</hi> where he sends us to seek it, in a <hi>General Council:</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> they must be <hi>lawfully assembled;</hi> and <hi>next,</hi> they must <hi>determine nothing contrary to what Christ and his Apostles taught,</hi> otherwise <hi>'tis damnable to receive their Determinations.</hi> Now it will be hard for me to find out how <hi>lawfully</hi> they were <hi>assembled,</hi> and therefore as hard to <hi>believe</hi> all their <hi>Decrees</hi> as <hi>Infallible;</hi> and, I fear, I must not be allow'd to <hi>examine</hi> their <hi>Definitions,</hi> whether they be according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> or no, lest I thereby seem to follow my own <hi>private Iudgment</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> rather than the <hi>Infallible Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Church Representative.</hi> This is all then that I can learn from his Discourse; I must take it for a <hi>Truth,</hi> that this <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is lodg'd in a <hi>General Council,</hi> and that it can <hi>determine</hi> nothing <hi>contrary</hi> to the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> and then I need not <hi>inquire</hi> whether it have done so, or no; tho if it have done so, 'tis <hi>damnable</hi> for me to receive its <hi>Determinations.</hi> But I will hear what others tell me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith, <hi>That all Catholicks are thus far agreed, That the</hi> POPE, <hi>as he is</hi> POPE, <hi>in the midst of his Councellors, or together with a General</hi> COUNCIL, <hi>may Err, or Iudg amiss in matters of Fact.</hi> And if this be true, he may even so <hi>err</hi> in the <hi>whole Faith,</hi> as far as I can yet see; for he may thus <hi>err</hi> in determining that there were such <hi>Men</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> that any of them <hi>Preached,</hi> planted <hi>Churches,</hi> writ <hi>Books;</hi> that <hi>these</hi> are their <hi>Books,</hi> or that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>ROME,</hi> and was <hi>Bishop</hi> there; left the <hi>Bishops</hi> of that <hi>See</hi> his <hi>Successors</hi> in all his <hi>Power;</hi> that there hath been an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> in that <hi>Church;</hi> that any <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> concerning <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> were left to the Custody of the <hi>Church;</hi> and many more such things, which were matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> and on which the <hi>Faith</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> depends. Again he saith, <hi>That the</hi> POPE, <hi>as a private Doctor, may Err, even through Ignorance, in matters both of Faith and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54867:38"/>
Manners.</hi> And thus the <hi>Church,</hi> whether <hi>Virtual</hi> or <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,</hi> may <hi>err.</hi> But I would fain hear, wherein she cannot <hi>Err,</hi> and whether all <hi>Catholicks</hi> are agreed as well in that.</p>
               <p>The famous <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Paris, Gerson, Almain, Alphonsus a Castro,</hi> the <hi>Parisian Doctors,</hi> yea, and no less man than P. <hi>ADRIAN</hi> the VI<hi>th</hi> (saith the same <hi>Author)</hi> have taught, <hi>That the</hi> POPE, <hi>as he is</hi> POPE, <hi>may be a Heretick, and teach Heresy, when he desineth any thing without a General</hi> COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIL. And truly, If <hi>as a Man</hi> he may be a <hi>Heretick,</hi> I see no reason why he may not be so <hi>as a</hi> POPE, for I take the <hi>Man</hi> and the POPE to be here <hi>both one.</hi> But further, these last named will have this <hi>Infallibility</hi> or <hi>Iudgment</hi> to be in the <hi>Council,</hi> and not in the POPE. And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> tells us, <hi>That this Opinion is not properly Heretical,</hi> and for this good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (which if it should not hold, they would lose a great part of their <hi>Church) because they that hold it, are tollerated in the Church; yet it seems erroneous, and next a kin to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi> It should seem by this, that an <hi>Error tollerated</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> of ROME, is no <hi>Heresie;</hi> but if <hi>not tollerated,</hi> it is. Indeed I know not well how ever she can <hi>Err Heretically</hi> at this rate, unless she will grow so <hi>unkind</hi> to <hi>her self,</hi> as not to <hi>tollerate</hi> her own <hi>Errors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same <hi>Iesuit</hi> tells us again, That it was the <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>Albertus Pighius,</hi> (and whether he was singular in it, or no, I shall not now ask) <hi>That the</hi> POPE <hi>can by no means be a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, or teach Heresie publickly, altho himself alone define any thing without a Council.</hi> And this <hi>Opinion</hi> he acknowledges to be <hi>probable,</hi> yet not <hi>certain.</hi> But I think 'tis very <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> that POPES have been <hi>Hereticks,</hi> either as <hi>condemned</hi> by, or <hi>condemning</hi> one another for <hi>Heresie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly</hi> (he saith) <hi>the most common Opinion, and that</hi> for which he brings a multitute of <hi>Authors,</hi> is this, <hi>That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the</hi> POPE <hi>can be a Heretick or no, yet he cannot any way define any Heretical thing to be believ'd by the whole Church.</hi> This he calls the <hi>most sure Opinion,</hi> tho they who are of it,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54867:39"/>
seem not very well <hi>agreed</hi> among themselves about it: For some of them say simply, <hi>The</hi> POPE <hi>cannot err:</hi> Others speak it with this limitation, <hi>Proceeding maturely with the advice of his Council.</hi> But now, suppose he should be too <hi>hasty,</hi> and define something <hi>rashly</hi> of his own head; Oh! That <hi>cannot be,</hi> (saith <hi>Bellarmin) for God will not suffer it.</hi> And yet I wish he could tell us, Why <hi>God</hi> may not as well suffer an <hi>Heretical</hi> POPE to define <hi>rashly,</hi> or indeed rather <hi>deliberately,</hi> according to his own <hi>Heretical Iudgment,</hi> as suffer him, to whom he hath committed the <hi>Charge</hi> of the <hi>whole Flock,</hi> to fall into <hi>Heresie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, considering this <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>Opinions</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning this <hi>Infallible Iudg,</hi> to which all must be <hi>subject</hi> in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> I begin to think with my self, with what <hi>satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> I shall be able to live in that <hi>Communion.</hi> I must obey the <hi>Infallible Iudg,</hi> or else be <hi>damn'd:</hi> And who is this <hi>Infallible Iudg</hi> whom I must obey? It is the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ROME;</hi> this all can tell me with one <hi>consent;</hi> but tho this were true, yet am I no <hi>wiser</hi> for it; that <hi>whole Church</hi> never yet met to <hi>Iudg</hi> or <hi>Determine</hi> of any thing. Who is it then in this <hi>Church,</hi> to whose <hi>Iudgment</hi> I must submit? It is the POPE <hi>alone,</hi> say some; and yet these <hi>some</hi> are not agreed, whether he may not define some things <hi>rashly,</hi> without due <hi>advice,</hi> at least, when he is a <hi>Heretick,</hi> as some <hi>Popes</hi> have been, if <hi>Popes</hi> themselves may be <hi>believed;</hi> and it seems not impossible, that an <hi>Heretick, obstinate</hi> in <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> may define something rashly and unadvisedly. It is not the POPE, but a <hi>General</hi> COUNCIL, say others; and why these deserve not as much <hi>credit</hi> as the <hi>former,</hi> I know not; for they are tolerated by the <hi>Church,</hi> and surely the <hi>Infallible Church</hi> will not for shame tolerate any <hi>dangerous Error.</hi> 'Tis neither the <hi>One</hi> nor the <hi>Other,</hi> saith a <hi>Third Party,</hi> but a POPE in COUNCIL, or a COUNCIL confirm'd by a POPE; and yet whether the <hi>Determinations</hi> of such a <hi>Church-Representative</hi> be of full virtue, till they have been universally receiv'd, is made a <hi>Question</hi> by a <hi>Fourth Party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54867:39"/>
Where are we now, after all this, to seek our <hi>Infallible Iudg?</hi> Suppose a COUNCIL should define it as a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>the</hi> POPE <hi>himself is subject to a</hi> COUNCIL; and again, <hi>that a</hi> POPE, yea a POPE in COUNCIL de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the contrary, <hi>that the</hi> COUNCIL <hi>is subject to the</hi> POPE. This is no idle <hi>Supposition</hi> of an impossible or unlikely thing; for whosoever knows what was done in the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANCE</hi> and <hi>BASIL,</hi> consisting of as many <hi>Patriarchs, Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> as most of the Councils ever did; and again, what afterwards pass'd in the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>FLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENCE,</hi> and the <hi>LATERAN,</hi> under P. <hi>LEO</hi> the X<hi>th,</hi> must know that such a thing, at least, once came to pass. Suppose then this which once was, and if the POPE could endure to think of a <hi>Free Council,</hi> might be again; what should I have to ground any <hi>certain Faith</hi> upon? I must still under Pain of <hi>Damnation,</hi> submit my <hi>Faith</hi> to the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> It is not, neither I believe ever will or can be agreed upon, which is the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that of the COUNCIL, or <hi>this</hi> of the POPE, or the <hi>other</hi> of POPE and COUNCIL. The <hi>Contest</hi> is between those that will admit of no <hi>Iudg,</hi> and therefore of no <hi>Decision.</hi> Their <hi>Determinations</hi> already extant, are directly contrary one to another, yet both pretended to be of <hi>Faith.</hi> That <hi>both</hi> cannot be so, is plain; and it may be <hi>neither</hi> is so. And whether the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>neither</hi> be so, if I would determine for my self, I make my self the <hi>Iudg</hi> of the <hi>Church's Definitions,</hi> even of those to which I must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my <hi>Iudgment,</hi> or be <hi>damn'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Branch of <hi>Power</hi> claim'd by this <hi>Church,</hi> is that of giving <hi>Laws</hi> to all <hi>Christians,</hi> unto which all that will be <hi>saved,</hi> must yield <hi>Obedience.</hi> About this I find no better <hi>Agreement</hi> among them, than about the <hi>former. There is so great a dispute among the Doctors</hi> (saith one of them) <note place="margin">Almain. de Auth. Eccles. c. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>about the fulness of Ecclesiastical Power, and unto what things it extends it self, that in this matter few things are secure.</hi> Yet that such a <hi>Power</hi> there is, we must <hi>believe,</hi> or <hi>perish,</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54867:40"/>
tho none can certainly tell us what kind of <hi>Power</hi> it is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purely <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Temporal</hi> also. And an <hi>Universal Power</hi> it must be, tho we cannot learn how far it reacheth, whether to <hi>all,</hi> or but <hi>some,</hi> either <hi>things</hi> or <hi>persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is held by many</hi> (saith <hi>Bell.) that the</hi> POPE <hi>hath by Divine Right, a most full Power over the whole World, in Matters both Ecclesiastical and Civil.</hi> And for this Opinion, he names <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus Triumphus, Alvarus, Pelagius, Panormitan,</hi> and others; with whom their <hi>Angelical Doctor, Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> seems to consent; <hi>In the</hi> POPE (saith he) <hi>is the Top-height of both Powers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others say, <hi>That the</hi> POPE, <hi>as</hi> POPE, <hi>hath no Temporal Power at at all, neither can any way command Secular Princes, or deprive them of their Kingdoms and Principalities, tho other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they deserve to be deprived of them.</hi> For this Opinion, he names not so much as <hi>one</hi> of their own <hi>Communion;</hi> why, I know not, unless it were, because he knew it to be an Opinion very unwelcome at <hi>ROME;</hi> or because he thought there were but a <hi>few inconsiderable</hi> PAPISTS that held it. And therefore he fathers it upon the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> whose <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> to their <hi>Princes</hi> will better bear it.</p>
               <p>The REPRESENTER here tells us, <hi>He knows that the Deposing and King-killing Power has been maintained by some Canonists and Divines of his Church, and that it is in their Opinion lawful, and annex'd to the Papal Chair. And that some Popes have endeavour'd to act according to this Power.</hi> Yet is he not willing that <hi>Hereticks</hi> of any sort, should carry away the <hi>Honour,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> bestow'd upon them, of a <hi>Loyal Religion;</hi> but saith, <hi>That there are of his Communion three times the number, that publickly disown all such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that some Universities and Provincial Councils, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd it; and that Popish Princes sit as safe on their Thrones, as others.</hi> Yea, and <hi>he will engage, that all Catholick Nations in the World, shall subscribe to the Condemnation of all such Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Principles and Doctrines, and shall join with all good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants for the extinguishing them, with all that profess and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54867:40"/>
practice them, and utter rooting them out of his Majesties three Kingdoms, and the whole Universe.</hi> I must do him right, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this; for he hath not said, That the <hi>whole Church</hi> of ROME, or any <hi>General Council</hi> hath condemn'd this <hi>Doctrine;</hi> or that it is by <hi>publick Authority,</hi> for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence it gives, rased out of the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> nor the LATE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN <hi>Council;</hi> nor that <hi>Protestant Princes</hi> can sit as safely in <hi>Popish Countries,</hi> as <hi>Popish Princes</hi> may in <hi>Protestant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> And when he tells us, <hi>That the Sentence of the Supreme Pastor is to be obey'd, whether he be Infallible or no;</hi> altho I have a great Opinion of the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of many PAPISTS, I durst hardly <hi>engage</hi> for <hi>his,</hi> if there should chance to be such a POPE again, as himself confesseth some have been.</p>
               <p>But what saith <hi>Bellarmin? A third sort there is, that takes a middle way;</hi> and he names not a few of them, himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the number. <hi>These hold, that the</hi> POPE, <hi>as</hi> POPE, <hi>hath indeed no Temporal Power directly and immediately, but Spiritually only.</hi> And such as he makes it, there needs no more; for it will serve his <hi>Holiness</hi> as <hi>well,</hi> and the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> as <hi>ill,</hi> to all intents and purposes, yea even to the <hi>depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> as the greatest <hi>Temporal Power</hi> in the World. For (saith he) <hi>by reason of this Spiritual, he hath also, at least indirectly, a Temporal Power, and that no less than the highest. And even as the Spirit or Soul hath Power over the Flesh, to Chastise, and even to deliver it up to Death, in order to the Spiritual ends of the Soul: So also may the</hi> POPE, <hi>tho not as an ordinary Iudg, yet as an extraordinary, in order to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ends, change Kingdoms, taking them from one, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to another, abrogate the Civil Laws of Princes, and determine of their Rights.</hi> This I am sure is more than ever St. <hi>Peter</hi> had by Virtue, either of the <hi>Rock,</hi> or <hi>Keys,</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal Staff;</hi> and I am confident, he never thought of half this, when he charged all Men to <hi>submit to the King as</hi> SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Nor when, <hi>v.</hi> 17. bidding us <hi>Honour all Men, love the Brotherhood, fear God, honour the King;</hi> he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54867:41"/>
omitted to mind us of the <hi>great Duty</hi> of all, the <hi>Subjection</hi> we must yield to his <hi>Successors,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> of ROME; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when he might well suppose we should have been much apter to have learn'd it of <hi>himself,</hi> than of any of his <hi>Successors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis time for me now, I think, to consider, into what a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> I must run my self, by going over to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>ROME;</hi> and how I can <hi>behave</hi> my self, when I come there. I am going into a <hi>Church,</hi> out of which, I am told, there is no <hi>Salvation;</hi> yet I cannot foresee, that this <hi>Church</hi> her self can tell me surely, how I may be saved in it. Of this <hi>Church,</hi> I am told, I cannot be a Member to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if I be not in all things <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> to the <hi>Supreme Head</hi> of it, the POPE. And subject to him I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, if I <hi>actively</hi> obey not his <hi>Commands;</hi> for <hi>passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> is now become the <hi>despised Badg</hi> of a <hi>Heretick.</hi> But what the POPE's <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>command</hi> is, I can meet with no Body that can certainly inform me. It is an <hi>absolute Power over all the World,</hi> say some. <hi>No,</hi> (say others) but only <hi>over Christians,</hi> and in things <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Well, (says the <hi>third Party)</hi> tho it be <hi>directly and immediately only Spiritual,</hi> yet it is no less for that; but in order to <hi>Spirituals,</hi> it reacheth over all, both <hi>Temporal Persons, Laws and Iudgments.</hi> All this <hi>Power</hi> is in me only, saith the POPE. You are too hasty, Sir, say some <hi>Councils,</hi> and the <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> for the <hi>chief Power</hi> is by <hi>Christ</hi> himself given to the <hi>Council,</hi> and even to <hi>put down</hi> and <hi>set up</hi> POPES, as <hi>they</hi> would deal with <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors.</hi> Which of these now must I believe and obey?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prince,</hi> under whose Government I live, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me one thing; and the POPE, my <hi>Spiritual Father,</hi> may command the <hi>contrary.</hi> How must I now do to bear my self evenly betwixt two such <hi>Masters?</hi> I consult my <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides,</hi> and take the best <hi>Advice</hi> I can get; some say one thing, and some another; and which to believe, I stand
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54867:41"/>
in need of another <hi>Guide</hi> to direct me; nay, the <hi>Church</hi> it self, knew I where to find her, (so <hi>visible</hi> is She) could not tell me which is in the right. If I believe those, who tell me the POPE has no <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Temporal</hi> matters; then is my <hi>Prince</hi> in all such Matters to be obey'd, say the POPE what he will to the contrary. If I hearken to them, that tell me the POPE has a <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> in all, both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> matters; I must obey my <hi>Prince</hi> in nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the POPE's <hi>leave.</hi> If I listen to them, who say, The POPE's <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>Temporal</hi> matters, is indeed the highest Power; yet <hi>indirectly</hi> only, and in order to <hi>Spiritual ends,</hi> then am I so far to obey it, and no farther. And here I am at as great a loss as ever; for who shall judg for me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Commands</hi> be needful for <hi>Spiritual</hi> ends or no? It is very unlikely, that my <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> should agree in the <hi>Determination</hi> of this Point; and the difference being between them <hi>two,</hi> and their <hi>Commands,</hi> to whose award will they stand? I must here necessarily be left to the <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of my own, or some other <hi>private Iudgment,</hi> and which side soever I take, it is an even Wager whether I can be <hi>saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been considering all this while for my self alone, and the satisfaction of my own <hi>Conscience.</hi> I presume not to judg <hi>for,</hi> nor <hi>of others.</hi> They who have more <hi>Light,</hi> and better <hi>Eyes,</hi> may go on more <hi>confidently;</hi> 'tis all my care, to go safely for <hi>my self;</hi> and as <hi>inoffensively</hi> as I can to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I see many <hi>Wise</hi> men among ROMAN-CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICKS, and I dare not say the contrary, but that they are of another <hi>Religion</hi> than I, because they are <hi>Wiser,</hi> and better able to <hi>chuse</hi> than I. If I chuse as <hi>wisely</hi> as I can for my self, I cannot do any better for my self, and I doubt not of being saved whilst I do so well. And if it should prove so, that I chuse the <hi>worse,</hi> he hath no reason to be <hi>angry</hi> with me, to whom I leave, and do not grudg the <hi>better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot yet think it necessary to <hi>Salvation,</hi> to believe that
