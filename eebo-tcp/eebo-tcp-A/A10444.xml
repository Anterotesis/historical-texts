            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

will bring you no other thing, but that
which is Auncient. I wil bring you back
to the Institution of Christ himself. You
shal haue al things ministred vnto you,
as they were in the time of the Apostles.
You shal heare God himself speake vnto
you. The Priestes shall robbe you no
more of halfe the Sacrament. You shall
knowe, what you heare readden in the
Church. Ye shal haue no Supremacie of
Pope, no Real Presence of Christs body
in the Sacrament. Ye shal be brought to
<hi>Old Customes,</hi> which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Councel of Nice

               <p>In the Opinion and Imagination, of

appeareth (I graunt) to be of more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
If Christ, in his owne person
speaketh, than if S. Paule his Apostle, by

And, no doubt, they haue a good Zeale

they haue not alwaies good knowledge
and Understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. The Maries brought
tidinges vnto the Apostles, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection

Wise and blessed women, And their

his Passion, so that they might well, and
should haue bene credited: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
<pb facs="tcp:27904:16"/>
their wordes seemed vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

to see perchaunce whether he coulde

And as faithfully it was to haue bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued,

Now, in these foresaid Persons and
Examples, the inward and harty deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
did somewhat extenuate the Carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the Affection. Mary in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

Yet, the Trueth and wisedome of

               <p>When our Sauiour vpon a time, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

If, I say, the Scriptures themselues are

without loking backe if any folow, Or

not be brought from it? If therefore
these fortie yeres last past (or what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

And further I say, that if

               <p>And therefore, notwithstanding you
iudge truly of vs herein and better of vs

doe not refuse the Authoritie of later Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Here it is plaine that you bring in this

in suche steede, that without him, you

               <p>You depende not therefore vppon

for your owne Opinion vse him,
that without him, you leaue your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
vnproued. But let vs see an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Example.</p>
               <p>It is required of M. Iewell, that
forasmuche as the Catholikes coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
yet finde, that the Publike Seruice
in the Primitiue Churche, was in any
other than Greeke or Latine, and hee
yet is sure of the Contrarye, that it was

Uulgare People: he shew therefore his
Profes and Authorities, suche by all

sayth.</p>
               <p>And,<note place="margin">Iew. 175.</note> to auoyde multitude of woordes,

               <p>Nycolas Lyra, and Thomas de Aquine,

               <p>And in the next leafe folowing, he alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

doth he alleage them? Will he saye, he
condescended herein to D. Hardinges
Infirmitie? And, that he vseth his owne
Doctours for the better contentation of
his mind? No verely he must not say so.
For he was required to bring his owne
groundes and witnesses, and not such,
as are alowed only <hi>per accidens,</hi> that is,
because it so happeneth, that <hi>an other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Good Christian Reader,</hi> (sayeth he,) for
<hi>the better Contentation of thy mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the cause then be <hi>good and pregna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi>
why vse you so ill and baren Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
as all theirs are (if your accompt
be true) which come furth, after the first
six hundred yeres? And, if you seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Contentation</hi> of your Readers
mind, you signifie thereby, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
which you alleage, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and alowable. Not, because Doctor
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:27904:43"/>
Harding will make no Exception, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce,
against them, but because your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
like them and esteeme them.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, what <hi>Contentation of the
Readers mind,</hi> call you this, to Reason
vpon their Authorities, whom yourself
would haue to be contemned? Or, to
establish any opinion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such groundes
vpon which you can build nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
vnto him, which holdeth them for

you make not (I trust) euery your <hi>good
Christian Reader</hi> to be. Especially, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, by your oft Appealing to the
first six hundred yeres, being occasioned,
to set litle by anye Testimonie of lower
time and degree.</p>
               <p>Thus we see againe, that M. Iewel
hath vsed the late wryters Testimonie
Eckius, Durand, Thomas Aquinas,
and Iohn Billet, not, because of D.
Hardinges opinion or regard of them
(which how greate or litle it is, he dothe
not know) but, because of his owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them.</p>
               <p>Neither doth he peeke (as it were) an
<pb facs="tcp:27904:44"/>
occasion to vse them, out of his Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
estimation of them, but whether
D. Harding aloweth them or no, M.
Iewell flatly vseth them, nor is asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the latenes of them. A thing,
at other times so materiall with hym,
that on paine of forfaiting all a mans la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
none must be brought in for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
but suche as are, within little, a
thowsand yeare olde.</p>
               <p>See one place more and with that, we
shall ende this Chapiter. It is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
betweene the Catholikes and the
Heretikes, Whether the woordes of
Christe, in the sixt of S. Iohn, are to
be vnderstanded, onely of the spirituall
eating of his body, Or of the Spirituall
and Sacramentall bothe. The firste
is the newe Maisters, the seconde is the
Olde Fathers. To proue the firste,
that the wordes of our Sauiour in that
Chapiter, are taken and meant of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
eating onely, Thus sayth Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Iewell.</p>
               <p>For to leaue S. Augustine,<note place="margin">Iew. 104</note> Origine, and
others of that age: Nicolas Lyra, a man of
later yeres saith, The said words of Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:27904:44"/>
must needes be taken Spiritually, and none
otherwise.</p>
               <p>Lykewise, one Michael Vaehe, one of
late yeares, a man of M. Hardings owne
syde, touching the same matter, wryteth
thus (<hi>against Luther.</hi>) This saith he, is
a weake reason, for, the woordes, that
be spoken of Spirituall eating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Sacramentall eating. Here may
M. Harding see, besydes S. Augustine,
Origine, and other olde Catholike Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whose Woordes I haue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged,
what men he hathe called Newe
Maisters. Nicolas Lyra, was an Englisshe
man, and liued two hundred yeares before
Luther. Michaell Vaehe, was of late
yeares, and wrote namelye against Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Heere I trowe,<note place="margin">Ra.</note> it is perceaued that
M. Iewell vseth late writers Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
in defence of his syde. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, whether the sixt of S. Iohn,
be vnderstanded of Spirituall eatinge
onely or no. If it be, let vs set your
Authorities (M. Iewell) and reasons.</p>
               <p>The new masters (as D. Hard. tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
them) expound it so. <hi>Thei are not all
new masters</hi> (say you) <hi>that haue so take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not, that it is to be vnderstanded onely
of Spirituall eating, but of Spirituall

Uerely, this is biside all reason, to tel me
that <hi>bysides S. Augustine &amp;c.</hi> I may <hi>See
what Nycolas Lyra testifieth,</hi> wher no one
Sentence or Halfe sentence of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines

                  <hi>I haue not alleged their wordes,</hi>
sayeth M. Iewel. And why did you not,
I pray you, Sir? Were you in such hast to
come to <hi>Nycolas Lyra and Michael Vaehe,</hi>
that you could not cary with <hi>S. Augustin,
Origene, and other old Catholike Fathers?</hi>
Is it your maner of writing, to spare the
Alleging of old Fathers? Or, was their
word, not worth the hearing? Or, must
we needes beleue your Assertion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further euidence? The Truthe is,
neither Saint Augustine, nor Origen,
<pb facs="tcp:27904:47"/>
nor any other old Catholike Fathers did
precisely say, that the sixth of S. Ihon,
must be vnderstanded only of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
eating of Christes fleshe. And you,
although you could not haue their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet you were so bold as to vse their
Names: And pretending, as thoughe it
were easie to see, that they did testifie for
you, so, you leaue them quite and cleane,
and bring in, <hi>Nycolas Lyra an Englishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and Michael Uaehe of late yeres,
to speake somewhat for you.</p>
               <p>Consider now (Indifferent Reader)
whether M. Iewel vseth the later Wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as Necessary Witnesses in his owne
cause, or no? And whether he bringeth
them in, as Men whom D. Harding is
well content withall, Or as Persons,
without whom, his sayinges, could haue
no Probalitie at all? For, if he had alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
first S. Augustine, Origen, and other
old Catholike Fathers, and afterwardes,
had rehersed the Opinions and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of later writers: he might haue
ben thought to haue done it for A Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plussage,
and to haue sought thereby, to
perswade rather his Aduersarie, than to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:27904:47"/>
Confirme his owne Assertion. But on
the other side now, to <hi>leaue S. Augustine,
Origen and other Fathers,</hi> and to stay on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon Lyra and Uaehe, what other
thing is it, than to Protest that by their
Testimonies his cause is Sufficientlye
proued? And, to take vantage of their
sayinges, which liued out of the six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
next after Christ? And, this is that
which deserueth iust Indignation, that
any man, bearing the Person and Face,
of one that had discretion or Conscience,
should bind an other to a certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of Time and Yeres, which, in no
case, he should passe, in Debating of any
controuersie: And yet, would in the
meane Time himselfe, Argue, Reason,
and Conclude, out of any Time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to haue it stand, for profe good and
sufficient, of his owne Assertions: And to
vse that kind of Libertie or Prerogatiue,
not only when he speaketh <hi>ad hominem,</hi>
that is, to the Meaning, Sense, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or Fancie of the man, with whom he
hath to doe, but also, <hi>ad rem,</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne Meaning &amp; Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which, he taketh the testimonies
<pb facs="tcp:27904:48"/>
by himselfe alleaged, to perteine, Direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in deede, to Confirmation of the

Testimonies, not for any stay of his own
Opinions (the contrary whereof I haue
shewed) but to stop only D. Hardinges
mouthe, and to set one Papist against an
other, Let him so saie, and let vs so take
it: yet, is this no indifferent dealing.
For, if he wil bind vs to the first six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeres, and himselfe yet, will presse
vs with Authorities of later age, either
he mindeth that we shall Answer him in
them, or holde our peace and be still.</p>
               <p>If we shall answer: why apointed he
the Lymites of six hundred yeres to be
kept of vs? For, when he prouoketh vs,
with mater collected out of the cumpasse
of them, we must needes come also out of
them, and ioyne with him, therevpon.</p>
               <p>And, if he minded that we should not
at all Answer him, and that himselfe yet,
would Obiect suche Testimonies vnto

we shall Iudge of him, that he is so
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:27904:48"/>
Folishe, as to apoint it, or so Proude and
Stately, as to conceiue it, that it maye be
lawfull for him, in fighting against his
Aduersarie, to haue certaine Places open
vnto his Desperate Foynes, and that no
Warding of the Daunger, and no Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
should be vsed. And therefore,</p>
               <p>It is not to be graunted vnto you M.
Iewel, to Bind vs to the first six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeres, And to be Loose yourselfe,
concerning any witnesse or Authoritie, of
the nine hundred folowinge: To set vs
within a Circle, and yourselfe to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
out of Order and Cumpasse: To
forbid vs, the Alleaging of S. Bernard,
and yet to charge vs with the Opinion
of Michael Uehe, or any such other. No
Sir: to the first six hundred you haue
Appealed, to the first six hundred only,
you shall stand.</p>
               <p>If you wil Replie, they be our owne
Doctoures, and therefore we maye not
Refuse them: We Answer shortly vnto
you, that whereas in your Singulare
Iudgement they be no Doctoures at

alleage them and recite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as our own:
we therefore in this Case and State of
Reasoning with you, doe not take them
for our owne. Yea, they must be so comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon and so set aside, as if they wer
no mens witnesses at all, Because you, in
Drawing the mater to the first six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeres only, doe Import and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thereby, that, of al later Times and
Writers, you would haue A sad Silence
to be agreed vpon, and kept.</p>
               <p>But, where will M. Iewels Glorie
be then? And, if he himselfe shall vse no
Testimonie vnder the first vj.C. yeres:
how litle wil his Replie be? How vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
must his Answers be? How greate
Blindnes and Silence must he come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
Take away from M. Iewel, and his
felowes the last nine hundred yeres, and
you take away from them the Flowers
of their Diuinitie.<note place="margin">The flow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers of the new Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> Out of those yeres,
they Rake all the euill that is spoken, of
Popes, Cardinals, Priestes. &amp;c. that by

may commend their owne bare Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties.
Out of those, come many Canons
of Councels, Constitutions of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:27904:49"/>
Uarieties of Historiographers,
Conclusions and Distinctions of Schole
men, in the number of which, it is easy to
find somewhat, alwaies, that shall sound
against the Catholikes. Either, because
all thinges, are not to be taken as they
lie, but neede an Interpretation: either
because, when many write of one Fact,
Or intreate of one mater, they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
so throughly agree, in euery point
of the Historie or Question, but that he,
whome it Pleaseth to striue therevpon
with an other, may sone find A doubt Or
Argument to serue his humor of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
Out of those, many Gloses
are peeked, so Obscure or Trifling, that
were it not, for the Diligence of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
which haue brought them furth in
to light, They would as litle haue ben
sought for of the Catholikes, As they are
now litle estemed of them, when they are
Found out and shewed to them by the

               <p>Take therefore, the wrytinges of the

And, in all these so greate pointes, the

out of the Ecclesiastical Historie, for
A token and argument of Communion
vnder one kind: The Storie is, of A
noble woman and Heretike, which, being
driuen thereto, by feare of leesing her
husband, promised him to Receiue with
him. And, at the time of the Misteries,
hauyng the Sacrament deliuered into
her handes, she Receiued it not, but toke
of her Maied that stode by, A peece of
Breade, that she had caused to be brought
for the purpose, from her owne house.
Which, as she would haue biten, it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
in to a Stone. Hereof D. Harding
gathereth, that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27904:56"/>
If both kindes had then ben mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred,
<note place="margin">Harding. Fol. 45</note> she would haue practised
some other shift, for the auoiding of
the Cup, which, had not ben so easie.
<hi>what sayeth M. Iewel herevnto?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I maie not disgrace the credite of this
Storie,<note place="margin">Iew. 136. Flatering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> albeit, in Sozomenus and Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,

               <p>You signifie then,<note place="margin">Ra.</note> that you might doe
more, than you will. And, were it not
for A certaine quiet Affection, that is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly

because Sozonemus and Nicephorus
haue sundrie thinges, <hi>that may wel be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
Undoubtedly, this Storye should
be one of them, If it were, at this present
your Pleasure. But, because you feare no
Inconuenience, If you should graunt it,
therfore you make no Exception against
it. And yet, least by this letting of the
Storie to passe so quietly, you shoulde
seeme to geaue Occasion to some hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of taking vantage against you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

by: you geaue your Reader a watche
worde, that you doe not alowe the
Storye absolutely, but that you doe not
Disgrace it, And that this selfesame not
Disgracing of it, cummeth rather of
your free will and Humanitie, than of
any bounden Dutie. For, <hi>In Sozome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
and Nicephorus bothe, Sundrye thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
(you saye) <hi>may well be Filed.</hi> But
perchaunce ye neede not in this Storye,
to shew how finely you can file it. For
it foloweth.</p>
               <p>But I see no cause yet,<note place="margin">Iew.</note> wherfore M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
should blow the Triumph.</p>
               <p>As who should saie:<note place="margin">Ra.</note> If there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
losse cumming vnto you, by this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
then loe, you would File it. But
there is no Feare of any. And why so?
For,</p>
               <p>Why might she not take the Cup,<note place="margin">Iew.</note> and
faine that she dranke: and yet, Drinke
nothing.</p>
               <p>Shee might haue done so in deede by
the nature of Absolute Possibilitie,<note place="margin">Ra.</note> but
we speake nowe, what is likely to haue
been done, by the course of the Storie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27904:57"/>
And whereas in bowing downe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shee had taken the Sacramente into
her handes, and making resemblaunce to
Praye, shee might haue so handled the
matter, that shee should haue seemed to
haue put somwhat in her mouth. &amp;c. And
yet did not so, but prouided betweene
her selfe and her maide, to bring Breade
from her owne house and to eate that in
steede of the Sacrament: And yet prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
no shift to auoide the Cuppe, It is
very Likelye and Probable, that there
was no receauing of the Cuppe, at that
Present: for which, because there is (as
you wil not deny) a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leight in a womans
witte, she shoulde haue rather proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as beinge more harde to bringe to
passe.</p>
               <p>For in deede, to put the Cuppe vnto
her mouth, and faine that shee dranke, It
was an Easy matter: And more easy it
was, when shee bowed downe her selfe,
(after the taking of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sacrament into her
hands), like one that would praie, to put
her hand only vnto her mouth, And, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faine that she Receiued, or conueigh
the mater so closely, that it should not be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27904:57"/>
Perceaued: But, the Circumstance of
the Storie geaneth it, that she coulde not
escape so: (For then vndoubtedly she
had ben a very Naturall, to trouble her
Maied and her selfe, with care, to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh
the household breade vnto her, and
care to receiue it. &amp;c.) Ergo, neither
by putting the Cuppe only to her mouth,
(if any then had ben vsed) she could haue
satisfied her husband Or the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the lookers on, or her owne
feare.</p>
               <p>Now, whereas no Cuppe was at that
present receiued, she was deliuered of the
care, to find A shift to auoide it, And the
Precise and Singular prouiding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
householde breade, vnder colour of
the Sacrament, proueth, that she was
not trobled with any Feare of receiuing
the Cuppe, or care of auoiding it. And
this Reason or Argument, is problablye
gathered out of the Storie it selfe. But
let vs heare M. Iewels Deuise and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Imagine with hymselfe: If this Woman

But, wil ye know why not? I will tell

               <p>Such a Fauorer you be of Antiquitie,
and promising at the beginning of your

by A Figure of <hi>listing</hi> and <hi>Imagining,</hi> and

A plaine fact and confessed. Who maye

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:27904:59"/>
which is an Euident and Short historie,
doe so boldly argue against it? No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

which haue the Grace and Feate, to
let an Historie stand for true: and yet so
rightly to Gheasse at it, that, If the gesse
be True, the historie must be False.</p>
               <p>The Historie saith, the Gentelwoman
toke the Breade at her maides hand: M.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now whether D. Hardinges Gheasse,</hi>
(as M. Iewel termeth it,) concerning
the Receauing in this place vnder one

M. Iewel hath here rekened vp for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than the <hi>Sleight</hi> of a womans wit did
atteine vnto, let the Indifferent Reader
conferre and iudge. My proper intent
and purpose was, to shew by this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
how M. Iewel, can speake, so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorablie,
<pb facs="tcp:27904:60"/>
of the Auncient Histories of the
first vj.C. yeres, as though he would not
Discredite them: And yet how in deede,
he practiseth with suche Libertie or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse
rather against them, as
thoughe what him listeth to Imagine,
might be better alowed and liked, than
the fact it selfe, which the Historye wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth.</p>
               <p>But let vs trie M. Iewels fidelity, in
an other Example. What say you, to the
Liturgie of S. Iames? I trust you will
not make exception against it, that <hi>it was
found very lately in the Ile of Can die, Or,
sought out, and found, and set abroade of
very late yeres, Or, that it is a very little
boke of smal price lateli set abrode in print
about vij. yeres past:</hi> (which are so greate
maters in your Iudgment, that for these
causes, you will repell an Authoritye,) I
trust, that you haue no such thing, to laye
against S. Iames Masse. For, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonye
of an auncient Councel, we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that S. Iames wrote a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
or forme of a Masse. What saye you
then vnto it? <hi>It may be doubted of,</hi> you
say. And why so? For,</p>
               <p>S. Iames Liturgie hathe a speciall praier
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:27904:60"/>
for them that liue in Monasteries. And yet
it was very rathe to haue Monasteries built
in al S. Iames time.</p>
               <p>You meane, I thinke, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> there were no

serued of men and women accordingly, &amp;
the religious hauing all things prouided
vnto their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, might serue him quietli.</p>
               <p>But, what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? The forme &amp; accidentes
of an house, do not make a Monastery, no
more then y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maner of aparel doth make a

it was known &amp; estemed in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world:
yet (without all doubt) the Ordres and

thus much at the least: that, wheras euery
man, without further Examining of the
mater, wil reasonably gather, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty
and Paucitye, of the Christians in
the Primitiue Church, could not well
stretch to the Building of any such rich &amp;
great houses for the seruice of god, as are
now called, by the name of Monasteries:
<pb facs="tcp:27904:63"/>
it should therfore be suspected, that there
could be no Monkes at al in those daies.
For although wise and Lerned men, may
easely consider it, that the thing it selfe
must go before the name, and the Monke
before the Monastery, and the Substance
before the Accidentes, yet, through the
Desperatenesse of Heretikes, which care
not what they speake or faine against the
Catholike Faithe, the Simple or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sort is made to beleue, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
doe put so greate A Religion and
Excellencie in externall thinges, that it
must folow, there were no Monkes in
the Apostles time, if it be graunted there
were no Monasteries. And Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
they can not conceiue, what they
were, or will not beleue that any were,
except we should proue, that they were
of like making with these which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
to haue stoode very faire once,
in England, or yet to stand and remaine
beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p>It was therefore nothing els, but A
very Craftinesse of M. Iewels, to argue
against the Religious, for whome Saint
Iames praieth, because there was no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:27904:63"/>
building of Monasteries, in S. Iames
time. Or, if it was not Craftines, it was
plaine vnsensiblenes.</p>
               <p>For what can he answer? <hi>S. Iames Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi>
(sayeth he) <hi>hath an expresse praier
for them that liue in Monasteries.</hi> Be it so.
But what call you them in one worde?
for A name, I am sure they haue. Surely
what so euer name you geaue them, your
Argument must be this: <hi>there were no
Monasteries built in S. Iames time, Ergo,
there were no</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>:
that is to saie, there were no Religious
men, <hi>so rathe</hi> in the world, neither liuing
alone in solitarines, neither in felowship
with al thinges Common emong the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;c.
As though S. Ihon the Baptist, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, Helizeus, and Helias, could not
in their life time be Commended vnto
God, in a Speciall Prayer for Monkes,
Heremites, or Religious persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was <hi>very rathe</hi> to haue Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
or Religious houses built, so long
before the Gospel of Christ.</p>
               <p>Not to espie therefore, the rudenes of
this Argument, it was very grosse and
vnsensible, and vnlike, perchaunse, to be
<pb facs="tcp:27904:64"/>
found in M. Iewel: But, to remoue the
Intention of the Reader, from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to their houses: and to draw the que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stion
vnto this Common place, not, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Monkes or Religious Persons were

Grammatically, he should be easely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed,

vnder the Ambiguitie of the worde, goe
from one Sense to an other, and make A

in some sense his wordes be true.)
This in deede procedeth of M. Iewels

                  <hi>Eugenius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> answered to

<pb facs="tcp:27904:77"/>
in Aphrica, wherein, The Arrians might

               <p>Here now, of this Story and Text,
I gather, that the Bishop of Rome, is
<hi>HEAD</hi> of all Bishops, &amp; so much ought
the Aduersarye to graunt vnto me, if he
loued not, by force of consequence, to be
driuen vnto the confession of Truth, but,
of his owne accord, to yeld vnto reason.
For, when Eugenius the Bishop answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that he would write, that the <hi>Church
of Rome</hi> (most chiefly,) should come to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, what meant he thereby? Dyd he

                  </gap>es,
walles of Stone, or any such vnsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
thing, perteining to the Materiall
Church of Rome? Truly, then, for hys
wit, who so euer should thinke so, might
be President of that Councell, where
Postes and Pillers should meete togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:27904:77"/>
and heare the cause of our Religion
debated.</p>
               <p>But did he meane by the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> al the Christians of Rome? Who
then should keepe the Citie whiles they
were from home? Or how was al Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,
able to receiue them? Or what
hath the Laitie to do in Councels? Yf
then, neither the walles &amp;c. of Rome,
neither al the Christen people of it, be
rightly vnderstanded by the <hi>Churche of
Rome,</hi> which B. Eugenius would haue
to come to the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel at Carthage, what
other thing may be meant thereby?</p>
               <p>You wil say, perhaps, the Clergie
thereof. Whether al, or some? Yf al,
do you thinke Eugenius to be so simple
as to require, that al Priestes, Deaco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might come to the Councel?</p>
               <p>Yf some: what should they be? Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
from the Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Pope, Or subiect vnto him?
Yf Exempted: who should they be in al
Rome, with whom the B. of Rome,
should haue nothing to do? If subiect:
<pb facs="tcp:27904:78"/>
how could they come without his leaue
and licence? Or how should not he that
sendeth them, be much more higher and
worthier, then those which must aske
leaue to goe?</p>
               <p>What so euer you Answere, If the
<hi>Church of Rome be heade of al Churches,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of some parte of the Clergie therof:
must it not much more <hi>be heade of al Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
because of the Bishop there, which
is head ouer that Clergie?</p>
               <p>For, if the lesser thing, be in Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Authoritie, much more the
greater in the same kinde must be in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.
As, if an Angel naturally doth

                  </gap> vse so many wordes,
in opening this Argument, if we had to
do with Quiet and Reasonable men: but
M. Iewel wil needes be Ignorant, or
Contentious. For (saith he) Uictor
which reporteth the forsaid Aunswere of
Eugenius the Bishope,<note place="margin">Iew. 310.</note> 
                  <hi>Doth not cal the

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:27904:78"/>
Church, only he saith, Rome is the Chiefe,
or Head Church of al other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, he saith not <hi>Rome,</hi> but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Churche
of Rome.</hi> And if you wil defend your self,
that by <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is meant
in common speache, I pray you Syr, can
you not also remember, that in naming
the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> the <hi>Bishop of Rome</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstanded
to be spoken of? And, if in
other places it might be somtimes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
yet in this testimonie of Uictor, it
can not but be meant of the Bishoppe of
Rome especially.</p>
               <p>For consider, I pray thee (Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader) the Circumstancies of the
Storie.</p>
               <p>Obadus the Capitaine required a
Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel to be kept in Aphrica. In which,
it is for Bishoppes, not onely to sitte,
when it is called, but first to determine
whether it shalbe called or no.</p>
               <p>He required it also, of the Bishope
Eugenius. For although Huneryke his
Maister, King of the Uandales was in
those partes a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queror, yet there were
not at that time such Flatterers or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spellers
as might tel his Grace, that him
<pb facs="tcp:27904:79"/>
selfe was Supreame head of the Church,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d that he needed not to care, what the
Popishe Bishopes would thinke in any
mater.</p>
               <p>Thirdly Eugenius answered, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
would write to his Bretherne, that his
felowbishopes might come. By which it
is cleare, that he wisshed, not, either
for the material Church of beyonde the
seas, or al the Ministers and officers of
those Churches, but only for Bishopes.</p>
               <p>Fynally and Chiefly, he would write
(he answered) that the <hi>Church of Rome the
head Church of al Churches,</hi> might come.
And howe can this otherwyse be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed,
but according to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature of the
Mater, and Persons which he spake of
before? For, whereas A Councel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
Bishopes to be present, And
hymselfe expressly declareth it, that he
would haue his Felowbishopes come:
In saying, immediatly after, that aboue
all other he would the Churche of Rome
to come, he must so take these wordes, <hi>the
Churche of Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as they maie serue for A
Councel, and for the meeting together of
Catholike Bishoppes. But to suche A
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:27904:79"/>
purpose, it was neither possible, to
bring the externall Churche of Tymber
and Stone, neither was it conuenient,
profitable, or customable, to haue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole
Clergie of euery countrie, to be present
at Councels: Ergo he meant it of the
Bishoppe of Rome, hymselfe.</p>
               <p>Then whereas he would, the Church
of Rome most Chiefely to come, <hi>because
it is heade of all Churches,</hi> he signifieth
thereby, that his mynde and desire was,
to haue other Churches to come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
For els he would haue saied, I
beseech the Churche of Rome, only to
come, and not <hi>Chiefely.</hi> Because the word
<hi>(Chiefely)</hi> hath A Relation to other
that should come also, though not so
principally and agreablie to his intent
and purpose.</p>
               <p>Nowe in expressing this his mynde,
that he would haue other Churches, of
beyonde the Seas, to come, what words
vseth he? Doth he not cal straitewaies
for his Felowbyshopes? And in respecte
of them, doth he not require, that
<hi>most Chiefely the Church of Rome should come?</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27904:80"/>
And what other sense can that haue, by
any reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that the Bishop of Rome
should come? For, if he had said thus,
<hi>I vvil vyrite to my Brethren, that the Churches
of beyond the Seas may come, and most chiefly
to the Church of Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> then had the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence
gone forwarde in like termes. And in
this case, who but Rude and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
would deny, that by <hi>Churches</hi> he
meaneth the Bishops them selues, Or
by theyr appointment some to represent
or fil their place? But he changed the
Termes, and in one parte speaking of
<hi>Bishops,</hi> in the other he nameth not the
Bishope, but the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet what of this? Shal this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Termes alter his meaning?</p>
               <p>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d wishing in the former parte of his
sentence, that Bishoppes should come,
but especially the <hi>Churche of Rome,</hi> what
can he rightly meane by the <hi>church of Rome</hi>
but the Bishoppe of Rome, yf one part
of the sentence hangeth with the other?
For this were al together out of reason,
that, naming first Bishops, and then a
thing more requisite in the same kinde of
purpose, then Bishops: he should meane
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:27904:80"/>
by that thing which he preferreth, a lesse
in effect and Authoritie, then they were
whom he had lesse compted vpon.</p>
               <p>This place then making so plainly,
for the Authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Bishop or Church
of Rome (for al is in effect one, to them
that vnderstand the common phrases of
Speach) what wil M. Iewel do? Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe

I can not tel verely, there is so litle po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
or none rather at al, in any thinge
that they can doe. Yet (for example
sake) if it were put in his minde to make
a Crosse vpon the breast of the deade bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or to put a Relique of some holy man
vpon it, Or the Gospel of S. Iohn, Or
a peece of holy breade, Or (if these things
would not like him) if he should venter
to put vpon it a leafe of Caluines Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
Or of the Communion bookes,
Or a peece of Latimers staffe, Or Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

other thing that he estemeth: If that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any of these thinges were put on the

it were cast or buried: were it a likely

haue applied that to the deade Bodie, of
which a merueilouse and comfortable

               </p>
               <p>But al this hitherto, is nothing to
the disprouing of the foresaid Decree, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that it is not Soters, either that it
is not to be credited, if as <hi>others say,</hi> it
were Anacletus. He busieth him selfe
in general and Indefinite propositions,
to no purpose, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, but to breed
Suspitions and Doubtes. Much like
as if in reasoning against some heretike,
I would not, nor could not proue that
he were a Diuel, but yet would tel a
long tale and proue it very substantially,
that the Diuel hath oftentimes gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
and ben conuersant with men, and
spoken very manerly of Religion, so like
an honest and true man, as any may seme
to be in al the worlde.</p>
               <p>Fifthly then, after all Preludes or
Preambles ended, he toucheth specially
the decree it selfe, vpon which the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of D. Hardings was grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. And
his reasons against it, are shortly these.
S. Austin, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Item, <hi>this word, Sole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

neither of people, but the Apointed and

the Mysteries.</p>
               <p>Item, <hi>It maie wel be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But let vs go forward.</p>
               <p>After all these foresaid Inuentions
to moue an Altercation and busynes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the decree of Soter, he would make
the Catholikes afraied, as if he should
say: If you wil hold with Soters decree,
I will dryue you to an Inconuenience,
and therefore you were beste to let goe

Mary saieth he, in that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
requireth, that the two (of whom he

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaketh) make answer vnto the Prieste,
<hi>there in is included both nearnesse of place,
for the people to stand in, and to heare, and
also a Common knowen tongue. Which
both are Contrarie to M. Hardinges Masse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he standeth nigh inough, I

he answereth in a Common knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
that answereth in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Latine tongue.
And both these thinges are done, by the
simple Parisshe Clerke, or litle boie that
serueth the Priest at Masse. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the decree of Soter hyndereth the
Catholikes, nothing at al. And if you
haue no more to obiect against it, than
these foresaid trifles, you maie either hold
your peace, or bring some other fressher
Argumentes.</p>
               <p>But other Argumentes you haue
none: Only you take it for a good sporte,
to note the questions whiche are moued
by the Canonistes about this Decree.
As, whether <hi>the two whose presence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
ought to be two Clerkes or two
laie men,<note place="margin">Iew. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:27904:103"/>
one man and one woman.</hi> The Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof is, <hi>that they muste be two

                  </hi> Yet you declare out of <hi>Summa
Angelica, that in Priuate Masse one is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</hi>
And to this you alleage Gersons

though but one be present, because he

               <p>The last quarel that M. Iewel hath

That question is moued by the Canonistes

And this appealing of the Donatists vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Emperour, and his hearing of the

very oft alleged by M. Iew. it is worth
while to be wel remembred, that which
I haue already said, &amp; that which by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
hereof may be further gathered,
and wel be noted.</p>
               <p>See then first, what busie Heretikes
these Donatistes were, and how ful they
were of Shiftes and Quarels making:
From the Emperour to Rome: From
Rome they go to the Emperour againe:
From him then by appointement and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
they goe to Arls and the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
there: And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Arls, they returne,

againe. At last, the Emperour himself

of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world accursed, which were not
of the syde of Donatus.</p>
               <p>Such is the nature and practise of
Heretikes, they pretend conscience, they
commend holy and Auncient Fathers,
They appeale to the Primitiue Church:

the Emperour dyd not see so much:
Yet fearing the busie nature of Schys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matykes,
and hoping by faire demeanes
to bring the Donatistes to a peace with
al Christendome, he yelded as much vnto
them as he could, and (as ye haue heard)
he receiued theyr prouoking to hym, not
because he thought that hym selfe was
the chiefest Iudge in all the world, euen
in maters Ecclesiastical, but because he
hoped, in yelding vnto the Donatistes
in al their requestes aboute apointynge
or changing of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Iudges, to bring them
at length vnto suche a remembrance of
themselues, that they should cease, for

               <p>Now, if at those daies, either the wyse

point of the law, &amp; to accompte vpon as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng

                     <desc>•</desc>

in conscience thinke himself to base to sit
and Iudge after Bishopes, whereas
enforced thereunto by the importunitie
of the Donatistes, and trusting, by that
his yelding, to pacifie the commotion
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> was reysed in the catholike Church, yet
was not sure of his doeinges herein, but
determined to aske forgeauenes of the
holy Bishopes?</p>
               <p>As if he should saie: The Donatistes
here, trouble the Church, They appeale
vnto me, as though I were chiefe. If
I wil not heare their cause, there is no
man shal Rule them: And if I take open
me to heare it, the Bishops, which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
decided it, wil be offended. Wel, I
wil venter yet, And if the Donatistes
wil stand to my iudgement, and be quiet
for euer after, that is so greate a benefite,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:27904:127"/>
that to cumpasse it, I maie stretche my
conscience. And if, for al that pretense, my
fact shal be misliked, I wil aske pardon
of the holy Bishopes, which haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
iudged of the mater, This is the very
trueth of the Emperours receiuing of
the Donatistes Appeale. He dyd it vpon
occasion, and if it were not wel done, he
was readie to take a pardon for it. In
all thinges he sought the beste waie to
helpe the Church, and shewed his moste
due, and humble, and Obedient affection
towardes Bishopes.</p>

You reason muche like, as if one
should saie against the Obedience due
vnto the priuye Councel of a Realme:
The Sonnes of King Dauid, the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes
of the hostes, Abiathar also the high
Priest, consented and agreed, saieing:
<hi>Viuat Rex Adonias, God saue Adonias
the King,</hi> and yet Adonias was not king,
ergo the Proclamations or Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of lawful Authoritie maie be litle
estemed. For this Councel of Antioche,
was a Schismatical assemble, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they deposed hym, ouer whom they
had no Authoritie, there is no absurditie
at al, nor fault to be laied vnto any mans
charge, that wil not obey, or lyke their
procedings &amp; doings therein. But when
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lawful &amp; head Bishope of the worlde,
doth define and subscribe in a Generall
Councel, though there folow no execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in acte, yet there is one to be done
by right. And it can be no sufficient excuse
before God, when the conscience shal be
examined, to allege, that because Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes
decrees haue not ben executed,
therfore the Obedience which is due to
the Sentence of Catholikes, maie be

that the Bishop of Rome sent for the

Neither Aunswered they any

               <p>A third maner of Abusing Councels,
is, to allege them truely in dede as they
say, but yet to allege them to no purpose.
As in example. The fourth Councel of
Carthage decreed, that in certaine cases,
the Sacrament should be powred into
the sicke mans mouth. of which worde

that are fluent and liquide, D. Harding

and not of bread. Herevpon M. Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
commeth against him, and he calleth
it a <hi>Gheasse, that the bread can not be
powred into a sicke mans mouth.</hi> But

               <p>Your Argument then is this:<note place="margin">Ra.</note> One
(y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is so foolish or superstitious) may put
the Sacrament into a dead mans mouth,
<pb facs="tcp:27904:139"/>

that bread can not be powred into a sicke
mans mouth. But al thinges are here
vnlike, both Persons, and Actes, and
Termes.</p>
               <p>First of al, dead men are distincted
from Sicke men, and the dead you may
order violentlie, but the sicke wil be vsed
Reasonablie, except none but Enemies
be about them.</p>
               <p>Then, in the one side, the Act is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauful
(to put the Sacrament in a dead
mans mouth) On the other, it is lauful
(to power it into a sicke mans mouth).</p>
               <p>Beside this, <hi>Putting</hi> is one thing,
and <hi>Pouring</hi> is an other, and whether it
be bread or wine, you may be suffered to
say, that they are put into the mouth, but
how bread should be poured into ones
mouth, except in al haste you minded to
choke him or fil him, I can not tel.</p>
               <p>Last of al, the terme <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which
is forbidden to be put in the dead mans
mouth, may signifie any of the two kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
That is, either of Bread or wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but in naming the Bread, you are bound
to that one kinde only of the Sacrament,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:27904:139"/>
and must not meane thereby, wine. So
that there is neither Rime nor Reason in
it, to tel vs ful solemlie, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was put in dead mens mouthes,
the Propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which you therby would
disproue, being onely this, that Bread
can not be poured into sicke mens mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes.
And therefore to speake the least,
and best of it, this is a very vain and idle
Abusing of the Authorities of Councels.</p>
               <p>But of al other it passeth, when M.
Iewel taketh,<note place="margin">Marke this trick.</note> as much as pleaseth him,
of any Canon of Councel, and maketh a
ful point before he come to the end of the
Sentence: Mainteining his Heresie,
by that Peece which he pulleth away,
And dissembling that which remaineth,
by which his Obiection should be strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
refelled. For otherwise, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herse
no more of a Canon, than serueth
our purpose, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and tolerable.
But when that point which an Heretike
leaueth out, pertaineth to the qualifying
of that other Peece, which he would haue
to be vnderstand absolutely, that is such
a point of an Heretike, as may wel cause
any reasonable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>BEVVARE</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:27904:140"/>
But is it possible, that M. Iewel
maie be taken in this fault? If he be not,
then wil I graunt, that he hath not, in
as Ample and Shamfull maner abused
Councels, as any of the most Desperate,
of all that euer wrote. And if he be, I
aske nomore, but that he may goe for
such as he is. The Example shal make
this plaine.</p>

               <p>The Interpretation therfore of M.

               <p>Concerning therefore the first &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

only because the Reuenewes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church

the Archebishop of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople about
this mater, &amp; no doubt but with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent, appointed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> order which

               <p>To the third point then I answer,

               <p>Let me be answered then in one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
You said,<note place="margin">Ra.</note> not twenty lines before,

sit one in an others lap? Or, shal one of
them stand whiles the othersitteth? Or
shal the prerogatiue of the B. of Rome be
interpreted, to signifie some other thing

               <p>For, if the prerogatiue, of the Pope be

               <p>But let vs consider the place it selfe.
<hi>The Church</hi> (you saie) <hi>of Constantinople
enioyeth the priuilege of the Elder Rome.</hi>
But what priuilege is that? To Rule the

To Confirme them? To disproue them?
To increase the Iurisdiction of Bishops

or Iustiniana, taking their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues
from Rome, can endue others
with like Priuileges, without consent of
the Bishop of Rome.</p>
               <p>Therefore, although the Bisshop of
Constantinople hath the Prerogatiue of
the Litie of Rome, it foloweth not, that
the Bisshop of Rome is nothing superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the Bishop of Constantinople.
And if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord President in Wales should
haue geauen vnto him all the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines

foloweth not, that the King and he are
Hayle felowes wel mette for euer after.
And Christ our Sauiour although he said
vnto his Apostles <hi>As my father sent me so
I send yow,</hi> geauing thereby vnto them
as greate Prerogatiue as himselfe had,
yet he meant not, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apostles should
think themselues as good as their head,
euen in those thinges which they should
doe as wel as Christ.</p>
               <p>M. Iewel therefore doth very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teasonably

that folow in order and row after

S. Peter. Now <hi>Order</hi> requireth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

of his Flocke and Charge. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this, hitherto proueth rather that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Pope of Rome, is the Chief after Christ,
and that al other what so euer they be, go
not cheeke by cheeke by him, &amp; as worthy
or Supreme as he, but euery man in his
order and degree after him. But this that
foloweth, is perchaunce altogeather for
M. Iewel. what is that? Marie</p>
               <p>A token vvhereof is this, that al Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
dooe equally both binde and loose as vvel
as he.</p>
               <p>True it is M. Iewel,<note place="margin">Ra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> the most sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in al the world doth binde and loose,
like as the Pope him selfe. But this
is true, in such thinges, as are permitted
vnto his Iurisdiction. For in some kind
of Faultes, the partie must be referred
vnto the Iudgement of the Bishoppe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And in cases of Heresie, Breaking of
Uowes, and Robbing of Churches, the
<pb facs="tcp:27904:189"/>
Bishop hath not in his hands to absolue
the offender, but the whole must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
vnto the Pope. And therefore,
although in such faultes as euery Prior
or Priest may forgeue or retaine, the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
which he excerciseth, be as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
as if S. Peter himself had absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
or bound the Parties: yet this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against the special Priuilegies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
al others which are graunted vnto
the See of Rome. As in example of
fiue hundred Capitaines in a Field, Or
fiue hundred Lordes in a Countrie, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one commaundeth the Souldier of his
band, or Tenant of his land, and yet this
is not preindicial vnto the worthines &amp;
excellencie of the General Capitaines and
chiefe Lordes.<note place="margin">Al that do one thing equally, are not of like Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> The Angels doe al of
them waite and attende vpon God, and
at the later Day, al the Electe shal haue
euery one his penie and reward: yet the
Cherubins are of higher Authoritie than
the inferiour Angels, and the Apostles
shal be in greater Glorie, than Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours.
What shal we say of Christ him
selfe?<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>As my Father</hi> (saith he) <hi>sent me, so

vpon them, and saith vnto them: Take ye the
holy Ghost. VVhose sinnes you shal forgeaue them,
they are forgeuen them, and vvhose sinnes, ye do
reteine, they be reteined.</hi> Here loe, you may
see that he hath made the Apostles equal
with hym. How then? wil you conclude
that Christ is not supreme in his Church,
and that he hath not the authoritie of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and loosing in a more high degree
than any of his Apostles? Such yet is
your diuinitie (M. Iewel) that because al
Pastours do equally bind &amp; loose, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pope hath no special Priuilege
aboue other. But you lacked the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
that al do equally bind &amp; loose
in such cases and Persons, as are subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
vnto them, And that, because euery
Bishop can not exercise the power of his
Orders when and where it pleaseth him,
therefore it is euident, that all are not
equal, but that the Superiours may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
the Iurisdiction of the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
which is inough to proue a Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</p>
               <p>Thus hath M. Iewel brought foure
seueral Auncient Fathers, al in a cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
togeather, to proue that, <hi>the B. of

Rome hath no speciall Priuilege aboue
others of binding and loosing.</hi> and there is
not one of them al, which proueth that
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion. For S. Cyprian, is plaine for
<hi>one head,</hi> notwithstanding the equalitie
of the Apostles in honour and power.
Origen, and S. Cyril, speake not literally
but mystically, And S. Basile last of all
telleth such a Trueth as euery Catholike
wil confesse, and is nothing contrarie to
the doctrine of the Supremacie, excepte
there be so vnsensible an heretike, that
wil think the lowest Minister in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
to be as high in Authoritie as
the greatest Superintendent or general,
because he preacheth and baptiseth, and
ministreth the Lordes Supper, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
(if neede be) in his opinion, in lyke
sorte as the Chiefest Superintendentes
themselues doe.</p>
               <p>And this vanitie and falsehood of M.
Iewels, when he allegeth Auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wordes without their Sense, is so
common, that I wil be bounde to make a

any diuersity of maner &amp; fashion, because it vvas,
much for him to shevv in an epistle, al that order
of Celebrating and Ministring the Communion,
vvhich the vvhole Church through out all the
vvorld doth obserue.</p>
               <p>As who should say: If it had not ben,
that the Apostle had not place inough, in
his Epistle to the Corinthians, to declare
his mind at ful: In what order, and with
what Ceremonies and Circumstancies,
he would haue the celebrating of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:27904:191"/>
plaine writing, how al thinges should
be don: but because that was to much for
an epistle, to receaue, And because the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which he would haue obserued, was
not so quickly appointed, as to Reade A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Chapiter or two of the Bible, and to tell
the storie of Christs entring into his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and that done, to receiue bread and
wine in remembrance thereof, and to be
thankeful: therefore he promised to come
hymselfe, and set thinges in order: and
therefore such orders and maners, as the
whole Church hath and doth throughly
vse, about the celebration of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
are to be thought to haue come from
the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Of these words then also (<hi>As for the rest
vvhen I come my selfe, I vvil dispose</hi>) it maie,
with good reason, be gathered, that the
Apostle did prescribe orders and rules to

and Place, with other Circumstances,
And that the Institution of Christ, stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
no further than to Consecration,
Oblation and Participation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
bodie: And that one alone or manie
togeather to receaue, was not, by Christ,

any such question intreated, as M. Iewel
reporteth, although I haue many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the contrarie, yet wil I say he
is an honest and true man.</p>
               <p>In the fifthe chapiter of that epistle,
these questions are mentioned, whether
vpon good friday, Oblation and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
should be done twise, in the morning
first, and then after supper, Item, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the people should, first keepe their
faste, then eate that daies meale, and last
of all haue the Oblation and Sacrifice
made. Or, first keepe their faste, and then
haue the Sacrifice made, and last of al go
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:27904:192"/>
to their meales meat. To which questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
his answer is, that euery man should, in
these points, do, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of the church is,
vnto which he cummeth. Because ther is
nothing in them, against either Faith or
good maners.</p>
               <p>In the next chapiter folowing, out
of which D. Harding toke his testimony,
the question &amp; doubt is, not, whether one
might Offer or Receaue in the morning,
or at euening (which perteineth to tyme)
but, whether he that had eaten the same
daie before, might afterwardes either
Offer, or Receaue the bodie of Christe,
whiche is A Question concerninge the
state of the Persons only, And not the
qualitie of <hi>Tyme.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> Unto which, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, that it hath pleased y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> holy Ghost,
that for the honour of so great a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the bodie of our Lord should first
enter into the mouth of a Christian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
external and carnal meates.</p>
               <p>Now because the heretike might say
(as some in these daies vphold) where is
it in al the Scripture, that a man should
come fasting to the communion? And whi
might not one (if he would) receiue after
<pb facs="tcp:27904:193"/>
Supper, as the Apostles dyd, or in the
Supper tyme, as the Corinthians dyd:
S. Augustine meeteth with this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
alleging that sentence which M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to like effect vsed, and saying: That
<hi>in vvhat order the Sacrament should be receiued,
Christ gaue no precept thereof, but left that office
to his Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let M. Iewel now, defend hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
if he can, and proue, that he hath not
falsly reported of S. Augustine, in the
place of the Epistle <hi>ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anuarium,</hi> saying
of hym, that he <hi>speaketh not one word of
the number</hi> (of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municantes) <hi>but only
of the tyme of Receauing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he speaketh <hi>only</hi> of the time of
Receauing, it is false. For these be his
wordes:</hi> Saluator non praecepit quo deinceps or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine
sumeretur, vt Apostolis, per quos dispositurus
erat, ecclesiam, seruaret hunc locum. Our Sauiour
gaue no commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in vvhat order it should
be Receaued, to the intent he might leaue that
mater to his Apostles, by vvhom he vvould dispose
his Church.</p>
               <p>Hereof I gather this Argument.
The apointing of Order, how thinges
should be don, doth extend itself to more,

               <p>Remember then,<note place="margin">Ra.</note> what the mater is.
You must proue out of S. Cyprian, that

should be so. The fact we graunt, but of
the necessitie of it, whether vpon paine of

               <p>And how then doth this geare hang
togeather, that, in deliuering it vnto the

the people? Or, that S. Cyprian should

reproue any man for not keeping of our

which it is most euident, that the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               <p>And this much might be said with good
reason, if S. Cyprians meaning were
not to be found expressed in open words,
within ten lines of these, which M. Iew.
hath rehersed. But it is so euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euen

what the cause of his writing is,
and what the fault is, which he woulde

thereof hath this sense.</p>
               <p>Albeit I knovv (most deere brother) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bishops do keepe the Order and Rules of our

I thought it good and necessary to vvrite letters
<pb facs="tcp:27904:198"/>
therof vnto you, that if any man be deceiued, he
may returne, vnto the Original of our Lordes

               <p>This is the first sentence, in which
there is Generally signified a thing to be

M. Iew. peeketh an absolute Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it is Christes Institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
the people should haue the Cup deliuered
vnto them, because he loueth not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> truth

of the next sentence is,</p>

And in this point, they are so much

sometymes not perfitly knowen of the

there is no doubt: Because in praieng to
God, deuotion and not eloquntion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
and because he might haue a good
grace, of preaching in his natural tongue
vnto the people, which yet had very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               <p>How then (you wil saie) is Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in a Bishope to be suffered? I say
not so, neither on the other side, I thinke
that al is marred, except euery man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

is to be suffered in the Church of God,

but that, which is the common and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen

there is a difference betwene wincking

iudgement to be vsed in this mater of

Augustine aloweth it not, that a Bishope
should not vnderstand the Latin tounge
in which he praieth, neither yet doth he
crie out against that lacke of theirs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
that al Publike Seruice should

Now if S. Augustine had ben of the

               <p>But, as it appeereth by this place,

               <p>And because the opening of so much,
would haue ben a great disauantage to

those ioly felowes, which would be ready
to mocke at Priests, because of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouse

the publike Seruice was then in Latine,

he may not Receaue the Sacrament at

               <p>Then, neither he saith as M. Iewel

               <p>Of the offering vp of Turtles and
