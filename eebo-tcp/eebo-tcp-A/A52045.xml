            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONORABLE
House of Commons assembled
in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>mercies</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath shewed to
these two <hi>Nations</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
giving us such great cause and
matter of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> causing our
sheafe to arise and stand upright, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
us with <hi>Saul</hi> higher by the shoulders then all
our brethren; these <hi>mercies</hi> (I say) deserve <hi>so</hi> to be
recorded, that posterity should be <hi>compelled</hi> to read
and admire them: but <hi>who is sufficient for this thing?</hi>
It was said of <hi>Claudian,</hi> that he wanted matter suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the excellency of his wit: but where is the
head or heart suitable to this matter?<note place="margin">Psal. 106. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Who can utter
these mighty works of the Lord, who can shew forth all his
praise?</hi> For my own part had I put my self upon this
work to utter these <hi>mean conceptions</hi> upon this <hi>great
subject</hi> before so <hi>great and honorable Audience,</hi> I
might justly have been condemned for abusing both
the <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>other.</hi> But you were pleased to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
my service in preaching on the day of your
publique and solemne <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> it may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I was then neer at hand, and after your <hi>Reverent
attention</hi> had testified that you received them as the
counsell of <hi>God,</hi> you were further pleased expresly
to desire me forthwith to print and publish what in
my weaknesse I then delivered, I suppose for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>memoriall</hi> of these <hi>great deliverances;</hi> I could
<pb facs="tcp:94564:3"/>
have pleaded much, why these poore notes should
not be exposed to <hi>publike view; Treatises</hi> to be read
by all, should be long meditated, often reviewed:
Excellent pictures should be <hi>engraven</hi> in <hi>brasse,</hi> and
not <hi>cast</hi> in <hi>clay:</hi> the setting forth these <hi>mercies,</hi> and
quickning up <hi>answerable Thankfulnesse</hi> are above the
<hi>Abilities of any man,</hi> much more beyond the capacity
<hi>of my self,</hi> the weakest and unworthiest of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands;
But your <hi>Order</hi> left me not at <hi>liberty</hi> to do
what I desired, you have thus made them your own,
the more facile I shall hope to finde you, and all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Readers towards my weaknesses, which not
presumption but my obedience hath made thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.
This further encouragement I have, <hi>little
things</hi> have been accepted with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
of <hi>Thankfulnesse;</hi> a <hi>female,</hi> a <hi>Turtle,</hi> a <hi>handfull
of wheat-floure</hi> by <hi>God</hi> himself; a <hi>handfull of water,</hi> a
<hi>bunch of grapes,</hi> &amp;c. by great <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours.</hi>
And even under this Notion <hi>also</hi> I humbly present
you with this ensuing discourse.</p>
            <p>I have no more to say for my <hi>self,</hi> but much I have
to beg of <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>you</hi> (Noble Senatours) and the
<hi>Right Honorable Lords,</hi> who joyned with you in this
<hi>peace-offering,</hi> may wholly <hi>consecrate</hi> your selves to
advance his glory who hath done these great things
for us all, that your <hi>faithfull endeavours</hi> to do what
is <hi>behind,</hi> joyning with your <hi>Thankfulnesse</hi> for what
is <hi>past,</hi> the event may be answerable to your desires,
even the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>good and safety both of
Church, and Common-wealth,</hi> which is the daily

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable and beloved, It
was a priviledge and mercie
which the Lord promised by the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 66. 10</note> That <hi>they
should reioyce with Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem

vouchsafed to my self this day: the same good
hand that cast it to be my lot (though most unfit and
unworthie) to help this Honorable Assemblie in the
day of their humiliation,<note place="margin">Psal. 84. 6.</note> 
               <hi>to dig pits in the valley
of Bachah,</hi> hath now designed me to sing with
them in <hi>the valley of Berochah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 26.</note> That after I had
helped <hi>to carry out their precious seed with
teares,</hi> I <hi>should come with ioy and help to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their sheaves,</hi> that after our <hi>Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
we should together sing <hi>Canticles</hi> and <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluiahs</hi>
unto our God. Thus the Lord in mercie

suitable to all his administrations!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94564:4"/>
The duty of this day,<note place="margin">Preface.</note> is to <hi>reioyce,</hi> and to <hi>give
praises</hi> unto God, a service <hi>easier</hi> to the <hi>flesh,</hi> then
that of <hi>fasting</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi> but <hi>harder</hi> to the
<hi>spirituall part.</hi> In a day of humiliation even wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men have affections stirring in them, conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of evill, guiltinesse of minde, sense of wrath,
astonishing and oppressing feares arising from the
apprehension of neare and unavoidable danger, are
naturall meanes to make even <hi>Pharaohs, Ahabs,</hi>
and <hi>Ninevites</hi> mourne and humble themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: But in keeping a day of spirituall reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
unto God, little or no help is to be expected
from the flesh, and that is one reason, why common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dayes of <hi>thanksgiving</hi> are translated with
much lesse affection, life, and savour then dayes of
<hi>humiliation.</hi> You should therefore have chosen
<hi>Asaphs, Ieduthuns,</hi> and <hi>Hemans</hi> who might
<hi>skilfully have helped you to lift up the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of God:</hi> but its now no time to complaine of
your choice, neither will it be needfull, if the Lord
please to be present,<note place="margin">Isa. 35. 6.</note> who can <hi>make the tongue of
the dumbe to sing,</hi> and can <hi>ordain his praise
out of the mouthes of babes and sucklings:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 2.</note>
trusting therefore his assistance, I beseech you attend
to his holy Word, as you shall finde it written.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Title.</note> a title pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to fifteen short Psalmes set downe together,
whether they bee so called because they were to bee
sung with an exalted voice, or because they were to
be sung upon the staires of the Temple where the
Singers were to stand, or whether for the superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
of the matter contained in them, (they being
so full of short, grave, and pithy sentences, all tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to exalt the praises of God) I know not: In this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94564:5"/>
all Interpreters agree, that for this third and last rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they all deserve to be called Songs of degrees:
and therefore any sentence of them will deserve and
call for the highest degree of our reverend attention
to the unfolding of it. This Psalme (and three or
foure other of these Songs of degrees) was unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably
penned by King <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Author.</note> who therefore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself <hi>the man raised up on high,</hi> because he was
the <hi>anointed of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and the sweet singer of Israel,</hi>
esteeming it a greater mercie <hi>that the Spirit of God
spake by him,</hi> then that the Nations were subdued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him: But upon what occasion he penned it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>historically,</hi> speaking of what was alreadie done,
or <hi>prophetically,</hi> foretelling deliverances to come,
(either that out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or that from <hi>Antiochus
Epiphanes)</hi> Interpreters agree not, but we need not
trouble our selves about it, because (when ever the
particular storie fell out) without question the Spirit
of God intended it to <hi>suite</hi> the like condition of the
Church in all ages: so that even we enjoying the
same mercie, and called to performe the same duty,
may say for <hi>our sakes</hi> no doubt this Psalme was
written.</p>
            <p>The matter whereof,<note place="margin">Scope.</note> is that, which <hi>David</hi> usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cals a <hi>new song,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 40.</note> 
               <hi>even praise to our God,</hi> yea <hi>the most
pleasant and comely praise,</hi> recording his dealing to
his peculiar people, to his own inheritance in such
mercies which he dispences not <hi>to other Nations;</hi> and
may all be reduced to these two heads.</p>

               <note place="margin">More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly opening the text.</note> And it contains 2. branches. 1. <hi>Therefore his
people praise him,</hi> because he is on his peoples side,
ver. 6. 7. 2. <hi>Therefore his people will trust in this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

vers. 8.</p>
            <p>The first branch or the use of <hi>thanksgiving,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In 3. bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> I have
chosen to speak of this <hi>day,</hi> wherein (for the more
quickning of their souls to praise God) the Prophet
first <hi>repeates and illustrates</hi> the <hi>danger</hi> they were in
before <hi>deliverance</hi> came; and secondly, the <hi>author,
time, manner, and way</hi> of their <hi>deliverance:</hi> and then
thirdly, <hi>celebrates</hi> this mercie in his return of praises,
<hi>Blessed be the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>danger</hi> they were in, is in
this verse, and elsewhere in the Psalme set out by 3.
<hi>sorts of comparisons,</hi> all expressing the strength, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and rage of their enemies, and their own near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to be ruined and destroyed by them. First, they
are compared to <hi>men,</hi> strong men, proud men, wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men, whose rage was kindled, cunning men, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
men, unweariable men, like men that go about
to set nets and snares to catch birds, entangling them
before they are aware. Secondly, they are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>wilde beasts,</hi> that go roving and roaring about
to catch their prey, whom there is no pacifying,
<hi>they had almost swallowed us up quicke, A prey to their
teeth.</hi> Thirdly, they are compared to the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterfull
and mercilesse creatures of <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water;</hi> their
wrath was <hi>kindled</hi> against us, the <hi>proud waters</hi> had
almost swallowed us. So that look what potent,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94564:6"/>
cruell, cunning men can do; look what ravenous
wilde beasts, Lions, Tigers, Beares, Dragons, &amp;c.
are able to do; look what fire and water, <hi>raging</hi> fire,
and <hi>proud</hi> water, look what all these are able to do,
and then you may judge what the Churches <hi>Danger</hi>
was before <hi>Deliverance</hi> came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, The</hi> deliverance, <hi>the</hi> author, time, <hi>and</hi>
manner <hi>of it, we have expressed in these words,</hi> God
hath not given us a prey to their teeth, our soul is escaped
as a bird out of the snare; the snare is broken, and we are
delivered. <hi>The lastly follows the</hi> return <hi>of their</hi>
praises <hi>for Gods needfull helpe in the time of
trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2. first branches, their <hi>danger</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi>
I shall but briefly touch, taking them in, onely as a
<hi>foundation</hi> or <hi>groundsill,</hi> whereupon the <hi>building</hi> of
thanksgiving (which we are this day to reare up)
may the more firmly and conspicuously stand.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>danger</hi> from these enemies thus described,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>First Branch.</hi> Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Churches enemies.</note>
teaches us <hi>among what neighbours Gods people live in
this world,</hi> and <hi>what they are to expect from them.</hi> What
ever the Lions paw or Foxes skin, open force and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
cunning is able to bring to passe, they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
look to be put in practise against them, thus
it ever hath been, thus it ever shall be till Christ have
subdued all their enemies under their feet.</p>
            <p>The Jews when they dwelt in their own land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> were thus compassed; on the <hi>East</hi> they had
the <hi>Moabites, Ammonites, Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Caldeans,</hi> on
the <hi>West</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> on
the <hi>South</hi> the <hi>Arabians and Aegyptians,</hi> and these
were all alike maliciously bent against them, and
when ever God let any of them loose, they presently
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94564:6"/>
executed all that their wrath,<note place="margin">Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Churches enemies.</note> strength, and policie
could bring to passe against them. And just so hath
it been with the Church of Christ ever since, they
dwell <hi>among men that are set on fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 57. 4.</note> 
               <hi>even the sonnes of
men, whose teeth are speares and arrows, and their tongue
a sharp sword.</hi> They are <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>persecuted</hi> of all
men,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 23</note> so that what <hi>Paul</hi> said of his own case,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 11, 12.</note> the

that shall betide me,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And would you know the cause of it,<note place="margin">The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses why they are so.</note> It comes
partly from the <hi>condition</hi> and <hi>qualitie</hi> of Gods people
in this world, their lives and conversations are <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
to other men,<note place="margin">1 Pet 44.</note> they <hi>dare not runne with them to the
same excesse of sin,</hi> this their neighbours <hi>think strange
of,</hi> and this their holy life gives checke to others, and
armes their consciences against them, and therefore
they hate them. This you shall see in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 10.
to be the cause why all the inhabitants of the earth
were so <hi>mad</hi> against the <hi>two witnesses,</hi> (that is) the
small number of them that bore witnesse to Christs
truth, in the time of Antichrists apostasie, because
these two witnesses <hi>tormented them that dwelt upon
the earth,</hi> and partly the outward condition of Gods
people is most what <hi>meane</hi> and <hi>contemptible;</hi> they
have indeed glorious things, but these are hidden
from the eyes of the world, their out-side appeares
as their Saviours did when he conversed here upon

every hawke dare flie at pigeon, any wilde beast run
at a silly lambe.</p>
            <p>2. And partly it comes from that <hi>inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and enmity</hi> which God hath put <hi>betwixt the seed
of the serpent and the seed of the woman,</hi> from which
enmitie it comes to passe, that the wicked can no

Sea can cease from casting up mire and dirt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>And partly from the</hi> devill, <hi>who as he</hi> reignes
in all the children of disobedience, <hi>so where ever he is,
he makes it his great work to</hi> make warre with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

<hi>and</hi> nursing Mothers, <hi>but Satan never turnes
Christian.</hi> Non semper saeviunt Nerones, sed nunquam
cessat diabolus. The devill ever goes about like a roaring
Lion seeking to devoure them.</p>
            <p>4. Yea <hi>God</hi> himself hath ordered it to be so for
his own <hi>glory,</hi> because he delights to <hi>rule amongst his
enemies,</hi> and to make the <hi>wrath of man to turn to his
praise,</hi> that he may shew his wisedome, power, and
love in preserving his <hi>Lillie among the thornes,</hi> and to
keep his <hi>bush</hi> (though burning) <hi>from consuming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the uses which this lesson might teach
us,<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> I shall onely name these two as most agreeable
to our present businesse.<note place="margin">1. Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> First, to admire, adore, and

God in the protection and preservation of his
Church and people in the midst of so many and
mighty malicious and impetuous adversaries. We
are prone to wonder why Gods people walking so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94564:8"/>
               <hi>innocently</hi> and <hi>inoffensively</hi> should meet with so much
hard usage, but alas could we read what is in the
heart and purpose of all our ill neighbours, we
should rather wonder that <hi>there is one godly man left</hi>
in the world:<note place="margin">1 Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>if we have escaped one</hi> danger, <hi>if we be come

<hi>God hath lately done great things for these</hi> two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

will see there is no cause of <hi>distrustfull fear</hi> by that
time I have briefly opened the <hi>next branch</hi> which is
the <hi>author, manner, and way of their deliverance. God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94564:9"/>
hath not not given us a prey to their teeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Where
among many considerable things) I shall onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to you these 2. <hi>observations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> First, That they were not made a prey, because God
would not give them as a prey to their teeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In it.</note> when they were as <hi>birds</hi> caught in the
<hi>net</hi> and <hi>snared, God</hi> chose that for his <hi>time</hi> to break
their <hi>snares asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first affords us this comfortable lesson.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Doct.</hi> No spoile of the Church, till God give her to be a spoil.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi>
how potent soever, how cunning or malicious soever, the
enemies of Gods Church are, how great, imminent, or
unavoidable the dangers of Gods people are, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
can be made a prey, unlesse God will give them for a
prey. <hi>All things seeme to meet that might make
them a</hi> prey, <hi>yet because</hi> God <hi>would not</hi> give <hi>them to
be a</hi> prey, <hi>therefore they were not</hi> made a prey.</p>
            <p>This is abundantly proved out of the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
when ever <hi>God</hi> told his people they <hi>should be spoiled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Proved by Scripture.</note>
it was added, <hi>he</hi> would deliver them up: When at
any time they <hi>were spoiled, God</hi> is said to spoil them.
<hi>God</hi> sold his people into the hand of <hi>Jabin</hi> King of
Canaan.<note place="margin">Iudg. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord delivered</hi> them into the hand of
<hi>Midian.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 1.</note> 
               <hi>God sold</hi> his people for nought,<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 8.</note> 
               <hi>he</hi> made
them a reproach, a scorn, and derision, <hi>he</hi> made them
turn their backs from their enemie. So likewise
when they <hi>desired deliverance</hi> from their enemies,
they used to beg in these termes, that <hi>God would not
deliver the soul of his turtle unto the multitude of their
enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 74. 19.</note> accounting all to depend upon <hi>Gods act,</hi> if
<hi>God</hi> refused to <hi>deliver</hi> up his turtle, they feared <hi>none
others</hi> catching or shooting his turtle.</p>
            <p>Most remarkable is that place in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 30.
The Lord did there in that song tell the people what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94564:9"/>
would betide them for their rebellion afterward,
they should be <hi>scattered into corners,</hi> and be made a
<hi>spoile to all their enemies round about them,</hi> insomuch
that <hi>two or three of their enemies should chase a thousand
of them, and a handfull of their enemies should put ten
thousand of them to flight.</hi> Now whereas they might
object and say, Is this according to thy <hi>promise,</hi> that
thou madest in the 26.<note place="margin">Levit. 26. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Levit. That thy people should
chase their enemies, that five of them should chase an
hundred, and an hundred of them should put ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
to flight,</hi> how comes it then, that <hi>one</hi> should
chase <hi>a thousand of thy people?</hi> Mark what answer <hi>God</hi>
makes them in that 30. <hi>verse.</hi> This could never have
been, <hi>unlesse their Rock had sold them, and the Lord
had shut them up.</hi> If God say to <hi>one,</hi> Spoile them, shut
them up, it is done presently. If <hi>God</hi> will not do it, <hi>all
the world</hi> cannot do it.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>ground</hi> of it is plain,<note place="margin">And Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> because God not
onely is a <hi>wall of fire</hi> about them,<note place="margin">1 Their interest in God.</note> keeps a <hi>watchfull
eye</hi> upon them, <hi>carries them under his wings, and in his
bosome,</hi> but even all <hi>creatures,</hi> all things which <hi>might</hi>
hurt them,<note place="margin">2. Their enemies depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> all their enemies who <hi>would</hi> hurt them,
have such a dependance upon God, that (not onely
<hi>in him they live, and move, and have their being,</hi> but)
all <hi>their motions</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> are but as Tools in
Gods hands. That although they seem to work from
principles of their <hi>own,</hi> yet the truth is, they are but
meerly as the <hi>ax</hi> and the <hi>sawe</hi> in the <hi>hand of God</hi> who
useth them. This the Scripture speaks an hundred
times.<note place="margin">Isa. 10. 5.</note> The great <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Assyria</hi> was but the <hi>rod of
Gods anger,</hi> though his heart thought not so. And
when he thought to do more against Gods people
then God intended,<note place="margin">Vers. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>1. We wrong the <hi>creature,</hi> which is but <hi>Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,</hi>
in over-fearing it, or over-grieving it, as if
our weale or wo did come from it; and so make an
<hi>Idoll</hi> of it, attributing somewhat to the creature
which is peculiar to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we wrong <hi>our selves,</hi> for (beside a great
deale of lost care, and griefe, and pains which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
our sinne, and sorrow in fretting at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
and gnawing the chain which tyes us, in
knocking at a wrong doore, seeking help where it
cannot be had) we lose the <hi>good which God intends;</hi>
God never sends a crosse, but it is upon some <hi>arrand</hi>
for our good;<note place="margin">Mica. 6. 9.</note> Gods rod alwayes hath a voice; <hi>Hear
the Rod and who hath appointed it.</hi> Now would we
hear God speaking by his <hi>rod,</hi> lie down at his foot,
and say with <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 10. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Shew me why thou contendest with
me,</hi> we should then finde, that Gods <hi>correction</hi> would
<hi>seal our instruction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 33. 16</note> to <hi>try us,</hi> to <hi>withdraw us from</hi>
some sinfull way, and to <hi>keep back our soul from the
pit,</hi> which, by not looking at Gods hand, we deprive
our selves of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we wrong <hi>God</hi> most of all, when with
our sinfull communicating to the creature a great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94564:11"/>
part of that griefe, care, feare, desire, &amp;c. which
should be onely bestowed upon him, we do also
hereby deny his <hi>providence,</hi> as if there could be <hi>any
evill in the City,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 3. 6</note> 
               <hi>which the Lord hath not done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Keep in with God and all is safe.</note> since we never can be a <hi>prey</hi> till <hi>God</hi> will
give us to be a <hi>prey, Keep in with God,</hi> and you are
safe enough; none shall arrest you, till <hi>Gods</hi> hand be
to the warrant. We observe, since the beginning of
the <hi>Parliament,</hi> many walk confidently abroad in the
very face of Creditours, Bayliffes, and Sergeants,
when they have got a lawfull <hi>Parliament-Protection,</hi>
who before durst not shew their heads; they know
they cannot be arrested till their <hi>master</hi> puts them
out of his <hi>protection.</hi> O how much more boldly may
they walk who abide under the <hi>protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,</hi>
who being called to great services for God,
and endeavouring to walke faithfully in their work,
may conclude that no <hi>Writ</hi> can be served on them
on <hi>earth,</hi> till their <hi>masters hand</hi> have signed it in <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
See how our blessed Saviour encouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his disciples by this argument in the 11. <hi>Joh.
ver. 7. Christ</hi> told his disciples they must go again
into <hi>Judea,</hi> why Master, say his disciples, the <hi>Jews
of late sought to stone thee there, and goest thou thither
again?</hi> Now mark Christs answer, <hi>v. 9. Are there
not twelve houres in the day, if a man walk in the day he
stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world.</hi> The
meaning is this; That as they who travell by day, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
in safetie, so they that walk in the light of Gods
<hi>call</hi> in any businesse, walk safe from danger: go about
a businesse without a call, and we walk as at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.
Men that have letters of publike faith, letters
of safe conduct, dare go any where through troops
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94564:11"/>
of enemies, from one end of an enemies countrey to
another: Go on therefore boldly, (ye Worthies of
the Lord) do his work faithfully, there shall <hi>no evill
befall you, nor any plague come nigh your dwelling, a
thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your
right hand, but</hi> till <hi>God</hi> put your Name in, till God
say to <hi>plague,</hi> or <hi>pox,</hi> or <hi>feaver,</hi> or <hi>Traitors,</hi> or <hi>death,</hi>
ceize upon such a <hi>Nobleman,</hi> take such a <hi>Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
they never can touch you. And I should expect
Gods delivering you in displeasure to any evill any
where <hi>sooner,</hi> then when your hearts and hands are
employed in his service.</p>
            <p>The second observation is from the <hi>manner</hi> and
<hi>time</hi> of their <hi>deliverance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Doct.</hi> Gods help comes in, in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> God let them alone, <hi>untill</hi>
they were almost in the teeth of the wilde beast, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the bird was even caught in the Fowlers snare,
and then he comes and snatches them as a prey from
their teeth, then he breaks the Fowlers snare, and the
bird escapes; And that affords us this lesson.</p>
            <p>When Gods people are come to the greatest extremitie
of danger, that is the time which God chuses for their
deliverance.</p>
            <p>There are 2. <hi>branches</hi> in this lesson.<note place="margin">Herein 2, Branches, 1. God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> lets evils come to extremity, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</note> 
               <hi>First,</hi> God
uses to let evils go on against the Church, <hi>till they
come to extremities.</hi> Secondly, <hi>when the extremitie is
come, then Gods help comes in.</hi> First, God lets evils
run on till they come to <hi>extremity.</hi> I do not say <hi>God</hi>
lets them <hi>alwayes</hi> come to extremitie, for then the
Church should ever be in extremitie, her enemies
are alwayes devising mischiefe against her: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>God crushes their intentions while they are in the
shell:</hi> Thus <hi>Jeroboams</hi> hand withered, when he said
against the Prophet,<note place="margin">1 King. 13. 4.</note> Lay hold of him. Thus the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94564:12"/>
Emperour <hi>Valens</hi> could not write when he should
confirm <hi>Basils</hi> banishment. Sometimes <hi>God meets
them in the midst of their enterprise,</hi> and thus he put
his <hi>bridle in the jaws,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kin. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and his hook in the nostrils of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi>
when he was coming against <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> oftentimes <hi>he lets his people come into</hi> great
extremitie, Josephs feet are hurt in the stocks, the iron
enters into his soul. <hi>The</hi> Israelites tale of brick shall be
doubled. David shall be hunted like a Patridge in the
mountains. <hi>The</hi> 3. Children shall be thrown into the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
furnace. Daniel cast into the Lions den. The Decree
for rooting out of the Jews established by the Law of the
Medes and Persians, <hi>before any</hi> hope <hi>of deliverance
comes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then <hi>when extremity is come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Branch. In extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity God alwayes helps his people.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord never
fails to be a help in the needfull time of trouble.</hi> All the
former examples prove it; Abundance of promises
assure us of it. Our own experience can abundantly
testifie it: Yea, I think, were all the examples in the
world lost of Gods helping his people at a <hi>pinch,</hi>
they might be all revived in the experience of Gods
dealing with this <hi>unworthy Nation,</hi> especially in these
<hi>two</hi> Instances which I shall give you.</p>
            <p>The first is, that of the <hi>Powder treason,</hi> when the
neck of the whole State, the glory both of the
Church and the flourishing Common-wealth lay
upon the block, and the Instruments of death lifted
up, and a few houres had done that which all the
world could not have repaired: and our case so much
the more helplesse, because all was done in the dark,
we could suspect no danger. In that <hi>extremity</hi> our
God sends his Angel, and delivers us from <hi>all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of his enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94564:12"/>
2. The <hi>other</hi> which is as remarkable, is this <hi>great
mercie</hi> which we have now received, and this day
come to celebrate: I speak to wise men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my words may be few, you all know our <hi>estates,</hi>
our <hi>Liberties,</hi> our <hi>Religion,</hi> and what ever we may
cal ours, were in a manner irrecoverably lost through
the malice and practise of wicked Instruments, and
a dreadfull cloud hath these two or three yeers been
gathering, and hanging over our heads, continually
readie to dissolve into showers of blood, the <hi>two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
readie to imbrue their hands in each others
blood, the most observing people in the Kingdome
expecting nothing but certain ruine, and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
round about us did conclude that we should
soon be made the most desolate people in the world,
help we could see none, our <hi>Prophets were growne
fools,</hi> and our <hi>spirituall men mad;</hi> The <hi>Judges</hi> and
<hi>Rulers</hi> who should have been our help, had many of
them their hands in the means of our destruction:
We were <hi>tantum non:</hi> swallowed up in confusion:
And when the foundations were thus dissolved,
what could the righteous do,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.</note> onely with <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>
mourne before God, and acknowledge, <hi>Lord we have
no help, we know not what to do, but our eyes are towards
thee:</hi> and now lo, our <hi>God</hi> hath brought all about,
and wrought a great deliverance as we see this
day.</p>
            <p>And would you know the <hi>grounds why</hi> it should be
so,<note place="margin">Reason why God is a help to his people in time of trouble.</note> I could give you reasons enough, why God should
help his people, they are <hi>his people, in covenant</hi> with
him, he hath <hi>redeemed</hi> them by the blood of his
Sonne, he hath <hi>promised</hi> to help them, their cause
is his <hi>own,</hi> they <hi>betake</hi> themselves onely and wholly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94564:13"/>
to <hi>his help.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</note> But why he should <hi>put off</hi> his help till a
time of extremitie, why he should suffer his people
to come to so lowe an ebbe, this is a thing which
many wonder at.</p>
            <p>To satisfie you in this,<note place="margin">And why he so oft defers his help till extremity.</note> I can never give a better
reason then our Lord himself gives in the 11. <hi>Joh.</hi>
There you shall finde when <hi>Lazarus</hi> was very sicke,
sicke almost unto death, his two sisters sent a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to Christ to tell him,<note place="margin">Ver. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Lord he whom thou lovest is
sick,</hi> they thought <hi>he whom thou lovest is sick</hi> was argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to fetch Christ <hi>presently,</hi> but though
Christ loved <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he tarried <hi>two or three dayes,</hi>
and sent this answer, <hi>This sicknesse is not unto death,
but for the glory of God, that the Sonne of God might be
glorified thereby,</hi> as if he should say, The true cause of
this great sicknesse, and my delaying to come <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,</hi>
is not because <hi>Lazarus</hi> should be tormented
or killed, but because <hi>Christ</hi> should be <hi>glorified.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Not to grieve his people, or please his enemies.</note> So
the very cause of <hi>Gods putting off</hi> and delaying to
help, and letting things come to an extremitie, is not
because he would have his people afflicted, and his
enemies to triumph and be exalted, but it is to gain
<hi>the more honour and glory to his own Name,</hi> to manifest
his wisedome, power, love and goodnesse in creating
deliverances for them. Such mercies as come in an
ordinarie way are commonly interpreted to come
from an ordinarie love, but mercies and deliverances
coming in an <hi>unexpected time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But for their great good, and for his own glory</note> in an <hi>extraordinary way</hi>
and manner, in them <hi>Gods</hi> love and goodnesse is most
apparantly seen and acknowledged. God loved <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>
as well at other times, as when he sent <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
to kill nine score thousand of his enemies at one time,
in one night,</hi> and when at another time, he made the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94564:13"/>
Sunne <hi>go back ten degrees in the diall of Ahaz,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one day as long as two, in token of his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
God loved the <hi>three Children</hi> as well at other
times, as when he <hi>preserved</hi> them in the <hi>fiery furnace,</hi>
so as the smell of fire should not be upon them. And
<hi>Daniel</hi> was as deare to God at other times, as when
he shut up the <hi>Lyons mouthes,</hi> that they could not
hurt him. But his <hi>power</hi> over them, his <hi>mercie</hi> and
<hi>goodnesse</hi> to them, his <hi>justice</hi> against their enemies,
never was so exalted, as in deferring so long, &amp; so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
helping them in their greatest extremity.
Themselves not onely finde it, but their enemies are
then constrained to acknowledge it. All <hi>Moses Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and threatnings</hi> could not make the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>
so much acknowledge Gods being on his peoples
side, as when they having promised themselves to
<hi>overtake them to divide the spoile of them, to have their
lust satisfied upon them, to have their hands destroy
them, when they were entangled in the land, when the
Wildernesse and the Sea had shut them in,</hi> God then
came in and made the Sea a <hi>path for his people,</hi> and <hi>the
waters a wall to them,</hi> but <hi>took off the Aegyptians Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
wheels,</hi> and <hi>turned the waters upon them:</hi> Then
they are constrained to cry out, <hi>Let us flee from the
face of Israel, for the Lord fighteth for them against the
Aegyptians.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see this truth cleared,<note place="margin">1. Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> that God never
fails his people in a time of need, let us briefly make
these two or three Vses of it.<note place="margin">Therefore all plots against the Church must prove successe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, for our <hi>Instruction</hi> we hence learne, that <hi>all
plots against the Church and people of God must prove
successelesse in the event,</hi> how wise, how cunning, how
strong soever they are, who manage an ill cause
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94564:14"/>
against the Lord,<note place="margin">Churches deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> and against his Church, though
for a time with that <hi>little horn</hi> in the 7. of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
they may be <hi>very stout, and speak very great things,
and make warre with the Saints, and prosper:</hi> though
they may carry the ball long at their foot, they can
never winne the goale, God will come in an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
against them,<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 65.</note> he will <hi>awake as one out of sleep, like
a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine, and put them
to a perpetuall reproach.</hi> Search all the Scriptures, and
you shall finde,<note place="margin">Isa. 54. 17.</note> that <hi>this is the heritage of the servants
of the Lord, that no weapon that is formed against them
shall prosper;</hi> either their <hi>plot fails,</hi> or <hi>the thing</hi> which
they <hi>intended is turned another way:</hi> Their <hi>plot failed
not</hi> in the 6. <hi>of Daniel,</hi> they aymed to get <hi>Daniel</hi> into
the <hi>Lions den,</hi> and in they got him, but they little
thought that the event should be <hi>Daniels preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and exaltation,</hi> and their own <hi>destruction.</hi> So the
<hi>devill</hi> and his <hi>Instruments</hi> failed not in their plot in
getting <hi>Christ upon the Crosse,</hi> but they little thought
that <hi>this bruising of our Saviours heel</hi> should prove <hi>the
breaking of the Serpents head, The redemption of the
Church, and the leading of all the power of darknesse cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
captive.</hi> Mark this all ye <hi>wisemen</hi> and <hi>great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians</hi>
of the world, that dare drive designes against
the cause of God and his Church, write it down, and
say your unworthy Minister taught you this day
from God,<note place="margin">Isa. 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Though ye take counsell together it shall
come to nought, though ye speak the word it shal not stand,
for God is with us. Hamans wife</hi> long ago could tell
her husband, if <hi>Mordecai was of the seed of the Jews,
he should never prevail against him, but should surely
fall before him.</hi> Weigh therefore all your designes in
the <hi>ballance</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> lay aside all carnall and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94564:14"/>
sinfull projects, put your selves and all your reason
under Christs footstool, take <hi>Gamaliels counsell, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
from opposing those men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 5. 3 8.</note> who advance Gods
work, <hi>you cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found
even to fight against God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging to expect help in deepest trials.</note> this may be a mighty and <hi>wonderfull
refreshing</hi> to all the servants of God in their <hi>deepest</hi>
and <hi>heaviest pressures and afflictions,</hi> though <hi>one deep
call to another,</hi> though thou seem to be cast beyond
the Antarctick pole, though all humane hope and
help fail, though thy <hi>heart fail,</hi> and <hi>thy flesh fail, thy
God will never fail;</hi> though thou art at thy <hi>wits end,</hi>
thou hast no cause to be at thy <hi>faiths</hi> end; take Gods
book in thy hand, finde out the promises, how <hi>God</hi>
hath engaged himself to help at a <hi>pinch,</hi> and when
thou hast got a promise of deliverance, then beleeve
that heaven and earth shall be jumbled together, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then one jot or title of Gods promise shall not
come to passe in due time: Nay though he <hi>seeme to
break his promise</hi> beleeve it not; for so he seemed to
do to <hi>Mary and Martha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And to stay our selves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and his Word.</note> he sent them word <hi>Lazarus
sicknesse was not to death,</hi> and he seemed to fail, for <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
died, but they should have beleeved any thing,
rather then that that sicknesse should have been unto
death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But what if I can finde no promise that
God will deliver me out of this strait. I answer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art in covenant with God, or not, if thou
be not in covenant, if thou be an <hi>unbeleever,</hi> an <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
person,</hi> I assure thee there is no <hi>promise</hi> in all
this book of God that speaks one word of comfort
to thee: All <hi>Gods promises are yea, and Amen</hi> to them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94564:15"/>
who are in <hi>Christ Jesus:</hi> I should wrong <hi>God,</hi> and his
<hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>thy soul,</hi> in speaking one word of comfort
to thee. But if in truth thou reliest upon Christ, the
bent of thy heart be turned to God, and so thou be
brought under the line of his covenant, then I say to
thee, if there be <hi>no promise</hi> for thy strait, thy strait is
not <hi>greatly</hi> to be regarded. God hath made promises
to deliver thee from every evill work, from what
ever might <hi>hurt thee,</hi> and thou needst not feare that
which <hi>cannot hurt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly,<note place="margin">3. Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to all Gods servants especially when em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</note> 
               <hi>Right Honorable and beloved,</hi>
how should this <hi>steel your spirits, and raise up your
hearts, and make you with Jehoshaphat lifted up in the
wayes of God:</hi> you have <hi>great works</hi> to do, the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a new heaven and a new earth amongst us, and
great works have <hi>great enemies,</hi> they are attended
with <hi>great dangers,</hi> and oftentimes <hi>great fears</hi> ceize
upon the spirits of <hi>Moses himself,</hi>
               <note place="margin">To feare nothing.</note> when he looks upon
the work which he knows too great for him. But
could you remember that you walk not onely under
<hi>Gods protection,</hi> but under a <hi>promise</hi> that he will come
in when ever you need him, how boldly might you
place your help in <hi>the Name of this God who hath
made heaven and earth:</hi> Set you <hi>your hearts</hi> to Gods
work, <hi>God</hi> hath set <hi>his heart</hi> upon you to deliver you,
and he can do it. <hi>Darius set his heart on Daniel to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him, and laboured it,</hi> but could not do it: But it
is but for your God to <hi>command deliverance</hi> and it
comes. I may say the lesse, because of all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
you have had of Gods fulfilling this <hi>since your
meeting together:</hi> how often have you been at your
wits end? how often have you ebb'd and flowed, and
yet in all your extremities God hath come in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94564:15"/>
your expectation. Trust still in this God, seek
him in his own way, and say thus with your selves,
<hi>He is our rock, our fortresse, he will deliver us, his truth
shall be our shield and buckler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet remember that I do not teach you, that ye
can never be left to suffer in a good cause, that were
to preach contrary to the Gospel, all Christs disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>must take up their crosse and follow him:</hi> you shall
read in the 11. <hi>of Daniel, ver. 33. That they that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
among the people, and instruct many, shall fall by
the sword, and by flame, by captivitie, and by spoil many
dayes, and when they fall, they shall be holpen with little
or no help,</hi> but yet mark what follows, their fall shall
onely be as the <hi>silver fals into the furnace:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note> There are
three ends why the Refiner of silver puts it into the
fire. First, to <hi>try</hi> it, whether it be pure or reprobate
silver. Secondly, to <hi>better it,</hi> to purge out the drosse:
Thirdly, to <hi>burnish</hi> it, to make it more beautifull. So
these <hi>shall fall to try them,</hi> and to <hi>purge</hi> and <hi>make them
white,</hi> neither shall it be so long as their enemies
please, but even <hi>to the time of the end, to the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God.</hi> Resolve therefore upon it, that if ye
do suffer, if evill do betide you in a <hi>good way,</hi> and for

which is our <hi>maine duty, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the praising of God is the service which Gods
people are to performe, when ever God delivers them.
<hi>This is a Doctrine which needs</hi> much explication <hi>and</hi>
application,<note place="margin">This duty 1 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</note> 
               <hi>but</hi> little proofe. <hi>No one lesson more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
in the whole Scriptures,</hi> frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
Call upon me in the time of trouble,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 15.</note> and I will
hear thee,<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 22.</note> and thou shalt praise me. All that seek the Lord
shall praise him. Oh that men would praise the Lord for
for his goodnesse,<note place="margin">Psal. 107.</note> 
               <hi>foure times repeated in</hi> one <hi>Psalme.
At least an</hi> hundred times <hi>in one expression or other it
is enjoyned in this book of the Psalmes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord, pressed</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated</hi>
almost in every verse of diverse Psalmes; as if
the Prophet knew not what other duty to call for.</p>
            <p>2. This duty was likewise <hi>typified</hi> in the old Law;<note place="margin">2 Typified.</note>
They had two sorts of sacrifices, shadowing out
morall duties, some <hi>petitionary,</hi> whereby they sought
God for the mercies which they needed: Others
were <hi>Eucharisticall, peace-offerings,</hi> wherein their
praises were rendred unto God, and these was to be
as constant as their <hi>Supplicatory</hi> or <hi>Expiatory</hi> sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <p>3. The duty hath alwayes been <hi>practised</hi> by all
Gods servants:<note place="margin">3 Practised</note> the time would fail me to tell of
<hi>Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses,</hi> all the <hi>good Judges,
Kings, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> whose <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> were
as constant as their <hi>Hosannaes.</hi> When ever they had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94564:16"/>
               <hi>sought</hi> God and found him,<note place="margin">The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fulnesse.</note> their next work was to
<hi>magnifie</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> him. And for the rule and practise
of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> I shall passe by many exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and examples,<note place="margin">Both in the old and new Testament</note> and satisfie you abundantly
with one place which is the <hi>fourth of the Revelation.</hi>
That Chapter is a description of Christs presence in
the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> and of all their service and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
towards him; there ye have the <hi>Lambe</hi> sitting
upon the throne in the midst of his people, there ye
have also, all the multitude of his <hi>Saints</hi> in all the
foure quarters of the world,<note place="margin">Mead. comment. in Apoc. p. 4.</note> shadowed out by the
<hi>foure beasts,</hi> there ye have the multitude of <hi>Christs
Ministers,</hi> shadowed out by the <hi>foure and twenty El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
sitting upon their seats: Now mark what all the
service is which these <hi>foure beasts,</hi> and <hi>foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Elders</hi> perform to him that sits upon the throne,
it is expressed, vers. 9. to be nothing else, but to <hi>give
glory, honour, and thanks to him that lives for ever and
ever:</hi> So that all Christian worship, publique, and
solitary, whatever the <hi>corps</hi> of it be, the <hi>soul</hi> of it is
nothing but <hi>honour, and glory, and praise to our God
through Jesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons of this duty.</note> Many reasons might be given,
why praise and thanksgiving should be rendred unto
God: <hi>All excellency and honour</hi> is his <hi>originall</hi> due: All
good things are <hi>received</hi> from his hand <hi>freely:</hi> Now
common honesty requires, that undeserved favours
should be received with thankfulnesse. A benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and a Return of praise are inseparable among
all Civill Nations.<note place="margin">The main reason. It is most deare to God being all which he requires</note> But I shall insist onely upon this
one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This service of praise is the onely Quit-rent or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
which God hath reserved to himself for all the
mercies which he bestows upon his Church.</hi> Vnderstand
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94564:17"/>
it, I beseech you, I say what ever the Lord doth for
his Church and people, he hath reserved not a <hi>shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latchet,</hi>
save <hi>onely</hi> his praise and glory. Which to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
know that there are <hi>three things</hi> meet in
every mercy. First, the <hi>thing it self</hi> which is given,
suppose food, rayment, health, life, peace, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or what ever we enjoy. Secondly, there is the
<hi>sweetnesse</hi> of it, the comfort which may be drawn out
in the use of it. Thirdly, there is the <hi>glory</hi> of it, or
the <hi>commendation</hi> that may arise from it, the <hi>honour</hi> or
<hi>praise</hi> which <hi>exults</hi> out of it. The <hi>two first</hi> God freely
gives away, he hath made nothing but he freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows,
he gives <hi>heaven</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> he
gives the <hi>earth</hi> to the <hi>sonnes of men,</hi> he gives all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
living upon earth for their use; And allows
them to take all the <hi>sweetnesse</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> which can
possibly be drawn out of his free gifts, lets them
drink and be filled with the juyce and marrow of
every mercie: <hi>onely</hi> his <hi>glory</hi> he will never part with,
his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> he will give to none. They say
<hi>Quit rents</hi> and <hi>Royalties</hi> are so prized by Lords of
Mannors, that they will not sell them under <hi>thirtie
or fourty yeers purchase:</hi> But the Lords <hi>Royalty</hi> and
<hi>Homage of praise</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving</hi> is more precious
unto him then <hi>heaven and earth:</hi> In somuch that it is
all one in his account,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>not to be acknowledged God, and
not to be praised.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est end of all his works.</note> Yea so deare is his praise and glory,
that it was the <hi>utmost</hi> and <hi>highest end</hi> he propounded
to himself in <hi>creating, upholding</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> this
goodly frame of heaven and earth, even that his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>excellency might shine forth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro 16. 4.</note> that as <hi>of him, and
by him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> so <hi>all things might be for him.</hi> And as all things
were made for his praise, so the creature <hi>man</hi> was in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94564:17"/>
               <hi>speciall manner</hi> made to be a fit <hi>bayliffe</hi> or <hi>gatherer in</hi>
of Gods Quit-rent of praises from all the rest of the
creatures, and to pay it unto himself. And this <hi>David</hi>
acknowledges in the 8. Psalme,<note place="margin">Man being in speciall manner created for it.</note> and magnifies as an
infinite advancement of man above all the rest of the
creatures, that <hi>Gods glory which is above the heavens</hi>
should be <hi>ordained to proceed out of the mouth</hi> of such
a poore worme as man is.</p>
            <p>Nay if we look yet <hi>further</hi> into it,<note place="margin">And the Church redeemed for this very and and work.</note> we shall finde
that when all mankinde had sinned, and sell short of
the <hi>glory</hi> of God, <hi>would not praise</hi> him, and <hi>could not
praise</hi> him, the Lord therefore bought a peculiar fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
to himself by the blood of his Sonne, that he
might have a people of his own to <hi>praise him;</hi> who
might while they are here upon earth, collect, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in, and offer up the praises due unto his Name.
And therefore he cals his redeemed ones his sonnes
and daughters,<note place="margin">Isa. 43. 7.</note> 
               <hi>which he hath created for his glory.</hi> This
is plainly taught in the 22. Psalme, in the latter end
whereof, ye have a description of the Church or
kingdome of Christ, which (as there is said) shall
be gathered out of all <hi>Nations,</hi> and all <hi>sorts</hi> of people,
some that are <hi>fat</hi> and mighty upon earth, some of
the <hi>poore</hi> that lie in the dust, who want bread to keep
themselves alive, all these shall be counted to the
Lord for <hi>a generation, a seed who shall serve him;</hi> and
what shall this service be? even to <hi>declare</hi> and set
forth <hi>his righteous works</hi> from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
here is all this <hi>holy seed</hi> hath to do; first to <hi>seek
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> then to <hi>praise him,</hi> to enioy him, and to glorifie
him. So that what <hi>Solomon</hi> said of <hi>fearing God,</hi> and
<hi>keeping his Commandments,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 13.</note> 
               <hi>this is the whole duty of
man.</hi> The same I may say of <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> praise
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94564:18"/>
God and glorifie him, for this is the whole duty of
the Church in <hi>this</hi> world; And not onely in <hi>this</hi>
momentany pilgrimage, but even to <hi>all eternitie:</hi> if
you would know what the triumphant Church
doth, how the glorious Saints and Angels are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
this one word <hi>Hallelujah</hi> expresseth it fully,
<hi>praise ye the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this time, I hope you see good reason
why our <hi>praises</hi> should succeed our <hi>prayers,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
our <hi>deliverances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But will some say,<note place="margin">Many mistaken in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this duty.</note> all this labour might have been
spared, is there any man who will not praise God?
Doth the man live who is not willing and ready to
give God the praises due unto his Name? I answer.
Indeed if to praise God were no more then most
people think, it were the most <hi>universall, common,
easie, cheap,</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> duty in the world, such who
never kept a holy fast in all their life time, such who
neither pray to God in their family, nor in their
chamber, do yet (if their carnall minds may be the
iudge) praise God an hundred times. Every day, their
ordinary phrase is, <hi>I thank God, I praise God.</hi> Ask but
of their welfare, well <hi>I thank God,</hi> they say: Enquire
of their families, all well, <hi>I praise God:</hi> Every mouth
is filled with the praises of God, <hi>blessing</hi> proceeds
out of the same mouth which is full of <hi>cursing: young
men and maids, old men and children can all praise God.</hi>
But alas, most men are infinitely mistaken in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
a thankfull man who can finde? there is not in all
the world a duty more <hi>rare</hi> to be found, a duty more
<hi>spirituall,</hi> more <hi>difficult,</hi> more <hi>costly,</hi> then the duty
of praise.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore (that we may not mistake when
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94564:18"/>
we come to application) give you briefly the <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi>
of a thankfull man according to the word, and
I will bring it all to these two heads.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">The Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a thankfull man.</note> the <hi>qualification</hi> of the <hi>person</hi> of a thankfull
man, who and what he is: Secondly, the <hi>Ingredients</hi>
into the duty, or what <hi>makes it up:</hi> Who the man is,
And what his work is.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">None but a godly man can do it.</note> who is the man that may praise God? Answ.
<hi>Onely the godly man;</hi> True it is, all men even the worst
are <hi>bound</hi> to do it, it lies upon them as a <hi>duty,</hi> but it
belongs not to them as a <hi>priviledge:</hi> it is the <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
onely</hi> of the righteous,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 1</note> they may do it. <hi>Rejoyce
in the Lord ye righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 149.</note> 
               <hi>it becomes well the just to be
thankfull. Let the high praises of God be in their mouthes.</hi>
Their praises <hi>please the Lord better then a bullock that
hath horns and hoofs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Though all are bound to it.</note> Not so the <hi>wicked,</hi> they have a
woolfe by the eares in this work; if they do it not<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
God will have his glory out of them. <hi>Pharaoh, Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,
Herod,</hi> such as proudly seek to rob him of his
glory, shall yeeld him his glory in their righteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
they would not do it with <hi>singing,</hi> they
shall do it with <hi>howling.</hi> On the other-side,<note place="margin">Mal. 2. 3.</note> if they
bring their <hi>peace-offerings,</hi> God <hi>spreads the dung of
their sacrifices upon their faces:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Es 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>They are an abomination
to him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 15. 8</note> See this notably expressed in the 50<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Psalme,
vers. 7. and so forward, the Lord sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>wed how little
pleasure he took in the sacrifice of <hi>beasts,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the sacrifice of <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving. Offer
unto God thanksgiving,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> 
               <hi>and pay thy vows to the most
high. Call upon me in the time of trouble, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> This God takes
pleasure in. Mark now what follows, <hi>But unto the
wicked, saith God, what hast thou to do to take my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94564:19"/>
into thy mouth?</hi> who required these things at
thy hands? so that you see whether wicked men
praise God, or praise him not, they are abhorred by
him. Just as some great Lord of a Mannour, who
having an enemy holding lands of him, will <hi>compell</hi>
him to do suit and service, and yet <hi>abhorres him in</hi> his
suit and service. But <hi>Israel may rejoyce in God, let them
praise him in the dance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 149. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>let them sing praises to him with
timbrell and harpe, for the Lord takes pleasure in his
people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>quare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The duty is made up.</note> what <hi>makes up</hi> the duty. Now
you have found the man, wherein stands his work<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Answ. When God appointed the sacrifice of peace-offerings,
<note place="margin">Levit. 3. 1.</note> he made it an indifferent thing whether it
were a <hi>male</hi> or <hi>female,</hi> so it were the <hi>best</hi> they had,
the <hi>best</hi> it must be:<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Cursed be that deceiver who hath a
male, and sacrificeth a corrupt thing unto God.</hi> Were a
<hi>female</hi> the <hi>best,</hi> it was accepted, provided it were a
<hi>whole one:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note> To bring a limbe of a torne beast, <hi>should
I accept this at your hands, saith the Lord?</hi> He will have
all,<note place="margin">Of 3. things. 1. Heart 2. Tongue 3. Life.</note> or none: A <hi>whole</hi> one then it must be: Now this
whole peace-offering is made up of these 3. things.
The first is the <hi>soul</hi> which is the <hi>fat and inwards of it.</hi>
Secondly, the <hi>tongue</hi> which is the <hi>glory</hi> of it. Thirdly
the <hi>life</hi> which indeed is the <hi>life</hi> of thankfulnesse.</p>
            <p>1. First the soule, the heart, and spirit, this must
chiefly be looked to, having to do with the <hi>Father of
spirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 138. 1</note> with <hi>God</hi> the <hi>searcher of the heart: I will praise
God</hi> (saith <hi>David) with my whole heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 133. 1.</note> 
               <hi>My soule praise
the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 108.</note> 
               <hi>and all that is within me praise his holy Name.
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed, I will sing
and give praise<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> Now to this soul-praising of God
are required principally these <hi>three</hi> things.<note place="margin">The heart to which required</note> First, <hi>A
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94564:19"/>
A minde observing the wayes and mercies of God,</hi> a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
inquisitive into Gods wayes, not out of <hi>Athenian
curiosity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. A mind observing Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> but (as Bees flie from flower to flower to
gather honey) to digest them into matter of praise
and thanksgiving. God makes it an argument of an
unthankfull heart, not to <hi>consider his wayes, nor the
operations of his hands.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 28. 5.</note> And on the other side, it is an
argument of a thankfull heart,<note place="margin">Psal. 111. 2.</note> to <hi>take pleasure in sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
out the works of God.</hi> See how <hi>David</hi> sets this
down in the 68. Psalme ver. 14. <hi>They have seen thy
goings, O God, the goings of my God my King in the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary:
then follows, The singers went before: the players
on Instruments followed after: Blesse ye God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi>
First they observe Gods <hi>footsteps,</hi> then
<hi>blesse</hi> him in the Congregation. And in the 107. Psal.
after the Prophet had set down the variety of Gods
administrations for which he should be praised, he
thus concludes the Psalme,<note place="margin">Ver. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Who so is wise and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
these things, even they shall understand the loving
kindnesse of the Lord.</hi> And ye may further observe,
that the thankfull men recorded in the Scriptures
have not let slip from their observation the <hi>very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>
of Gods dealings towards them,<note place="margin">Thus did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</note> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>substance</hi> of the mercie,<note place="margin">Ezek. 38. 9. &amp;c.</note> in a grosse summe, but
<hi>all circumstances</hi> which have accompanied it, as <hi>time,
place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for all his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</note> 
               <hi>manner, meanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this <hi>soul thankfulnesse</hi> must have <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
suitable</hi> to the mercies bestowed, when our heart
is affected according to Gods dealing,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 22. 2.</note> this is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.
<note place="margin">Sutable affections.</note> And these affections are chiefly <hi>love</hi> and
<hi>joy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa 116. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I love the Lord because he hath heard the voice of
my prayer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 33. 1.</note> And then they must rejoyce in his mercy.
<hi>Rejoyce in the Lord ye righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 92. 4.</note> 
               <hi>it becomes the just to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94564:20"/>
be thankfull. Thou Lord hast made me glad through thy
work, therefore will I triumph in the works of thy hands.</hi>
Mercies are not mercies, deliverances are not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
to men who are not glad of them. God gave
<hi>David</hi> a great deliverance from his rebellious sonne
<hi>Absolon,</hi> he upon the news weeps and cries out, <hi>O
Absolon, my sonne, my sonne.</hi> Was this thankfulnesse?
God hath wrought a great deliverance for us, can
those men whose fingers itcht for blood; and are
grieved at our peace, be thankfull for this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> the last thing which makes up this <hi>soul-thankfulnesse,</hi>
is the laying up and registring these
mercies of God in <hi>our memorie,</hi> to lay them up in our
treasurie, not as some do their bundles of old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in their counting-house, never looking on them
in seven yeers: but in a memory which may <hi>suggest</hi>
to them upon every occasion what great things God
hath done for them. A memory which will lay Gods
mercies before them, as the <hi>Chronicles</hi> which <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus
read when he could not sleep in the night.</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it should be so. <hi>The righteous Lord hath so done
his marvellous works that they ought to be had in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
remembrance.</hi> This thankfull memory feeds the
heart with continuall matter of praise, fils the
thoughts with <hi>admiration</hi> of Gods dealing towards
them, shews them how Gods mercies passe their
understandings in the manner of them, in the measure
of them, making the soul stand <hi>amazed:</hi> thankfull
hearts have found so much good in remembring of
Gods mercies, that they have been carefull to keep
<hi>Registers,</hi> and set up <hi>Monuments</hi> to help their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

Names of their deliverances upon <hi>their children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 14.</note> that
the sight of them might quicken their memories and
thoughts.<note place="margin">2. Chron. 20 20.</note> Yea God himself used to take new Names
to himself as he gave new mercies,<note place="margin">Esther 9.</note> sometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
himself,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 20.</note> 
               <hi>The God that brought Abraham from Vr

            <p>2. This is the <hi>Inside</hi> of a thankfull man, but if
praise be in the <hi>heart</hi> it will not <hi>be kept in,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 2. The tongue.</note> but it will
be like oyle in the right hand, like the word in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
heart, <hi>like a burning fire in his bones which he
could not contain within.</hi> The <hi>tongue</hi> will be set on
work, and beares a great part in this <hi>Musick</hi> of <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 66, 16.</note> 
               <hi>confessing</hi> to <hi>God, publishing</hi> to <hi>others, I will
tell you what God hath done for my soul. My tongue shall
ever be talking of thy wondrous works, and of thy praise
all the day long.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 108.</note> Our tongue is therefore called our
<hi>glory,</hi> because with it <hi>we glorifie God.</hi> As <hi>praise</hi> is <hi>Gods
glory,</hi> so our <hi>tongue</hi> in exalting him is our <hi>glory.</hi> Now
this <hi>tongue-praise</hi> is not confined to saying of a <hi>grace,</hi>
singing of a <hi>Psalme,</hi> uttering a <hi>Benedictus,</hi> or <hi>Te Deum
laudamus,</hi> but in <hi>all</hi> speech which tends to <hi>exalt God,</hi>
and sets forth his excellency.<note place="margin">Miserecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabo.</note> 
               <hi>Iunius</hi> told the mercies
of <hi>God,</hi> when he <hi>wrote</hi> his owne life. And <hi>Davids</hi>
tongue was <hi>ever</hi> talking of Gods <hi>praise,</hi> because his
speech <hi>one way or other</hi> rended to exalt God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, true thankfulnesse is expressed in the <hi>life,</hi>
as one truly saith, the <hi>life of thankfulnesse consists in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94564:21"/>
the life of the thankfull.</hi> The praising of God, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
our conversation aright, are not onely insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but exegeticall interpretations one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Psal. 50. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Now this life Thankfulnesse stands in these <hi>two</hi>
things.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">3. The life in 2 things.</note> in using Gods mercies to the <hi>right end,</hi> this
is to praise him indeed, without this all other thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
is but <hi>complement, formalitie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. In using mercies to the right end.</note> and <hi>hypocrisie:</hi>
Set this down for an everlasting truth, that its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
God should be praised with an <hi>abused</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Did Israel and Judah praise God for their <hi>faire
jemels of gold and silver which God had given them,</hi>
when they made to themselves <hi>Images of men, and
committed whoredome with them?</hi> Did they praise him
for <hi>their broidered garments, their fine floure, oyle, and
honey, wherewith God clothed and fed them?</hi> Did they
praise him for their <hi>sonnes and daughters when they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
them unto devils?</hi> Read the sixteenth of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
and you will finde the contrary. I shall give you
one example which will cleare it beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and that is of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 38.</note> God gave him a most
miraculous recovery, he was sick to death, and it is
thought he was sick of the <hi>plague,</hi> God not onely
healed him, but made the Sun go back for six houres
at least, and by this miracle told all the world, that
the <hi>God</hi> who <hi>loved Hezekiah,</hi> had recovered him
from death to life; Now mark <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as soon as he got up, he makes a Psalme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he confesses his unworthinesse, his bitter affliction,
Gods gracious restoring of him, goes to the Temple
and sings it, resolves to sing it all the dayes of his life,
who would not think but this man had been thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94564:21"/>
But <hi>Hezekiah abused this mercie,</hi> his heart grew
proud, he began to think himself the most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man in the world, discovers this vanity of his
heart to the Ambassadours of the king of Babylon:
See now what <hi>God</hi> judged of his thankfulnesse:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah
was sick to death, and God spake to him and gave
him a signe, but Hezekiah rendred not again according
to the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up.</hi>
Never doth a man <hi>render according to the mercie,</hi> who
abuseth the mercie.</p>
            <p>The second thing in <hi>life thanksgiving</hi> is the <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
back again to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again to God.</note> what God requires by way
of <hi>homage</hi> or <hi>Lords-rent. Quid retribuam? What shall
I render to the Lord,</hi> is every thankfull mans Psalme.
Now although no man can give unto God any thing
worthy of him, yet there are <hi>foure things</hi> which God
requires and accepts from all his thankfull people by
way of homage.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">1. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart.</note> an <hi>humble broken contrite heart,</hi> a self-renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
a self-abhorring spirit, for our vilenesse against
so gracious a God is infinitely pleasing to him. Oh
saith <hi>David</hi> (when God had pardoned his great sin,
and healed his broken bones) <hi>I would give thee sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and burnt offerings if thou delightedst in them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 51. 16. 17.</note> But
these God cared not for; but <hi>David lights</hi> upon that
which he cared for: <hi>The sacrifices of God are a broken
spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not
despise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and souls to his service.</note> 
               <hi>the giving up of our selves, bodies, and
souls,</hi> to have and to hold, and to use them at the will
of the Lord, to consecrate them unto him, to do him
faithfull service. This is notably expressed by <hi>David</hi>
in the 40. Psalme, when he studied what to render
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94564:22"/>
to God, and found that sacrifice and offerings God
did not desire, but this pleased him, <hi>My eare thou hast
bored:</hi> What is that boring his eare? why he alludes
to the practise in Israel, that when a servant did chuse
to dwell with his master for ever, his master <hi>should
bore his eare through with an awle.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 5. 6.</note> So saith <hi>David, I
will be thy servant for ever, I delight to do thy will, O
God, thy law is written in my heart.</hi> This is a little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
expressed, Hebr. 10. 5. In stead of reading it
my ear thou hast opened. The Apostle following the
Septuagint reads it <hi>a body hast thou prepared me,</hi> but
full to the same sence, as if he should have said, Lord
thou hast fitted me, moulded my body and soul to be
thy servant. This same thing the Apostle cals for, <hi>I
beseech you brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1</note> 
               <hi>by all the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
unto God, which is your reasonable service:</hi> this is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
peace-offering.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. A reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon his ordinances</note> when God had put an end to all Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
sacrifices, both <hi>Propitiatory</hi> and <hi>Eucharisticall,</hi>
in stead of them he hath instituted <hi>the attending upon
his holy ordinances, praying, preaching, hearing, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
to be in the Christian Church acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our <hi>homage, spirituall sacrifices acceptable
unto him through Jesus Christ.</hi> This the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
in the 13. to the Hebrews, vers. 15. Having
before shewed that all other sacrifices were abolisht,
he tels them, that the <hi>calves of our lips, the sacrifice of
praise</hi> were now to be offered up to God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly,<note place="margin">4. Doing works of mercie.</note> the <hi>works of mercie the poore,</hi>
visiting the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the
naked, ministring to the necessities of the Saints, are
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94564:22"/>
               <hi>an adour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing
unto God. To do good and to communicate</hi> (saith
<hi>Paul) forget not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>for with such sacrifices God is wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
Provided that because they are sacrifices they
must not be offered to the Idol of our own credit,<note place="margin">Heb. 13 16.</note> or
esteeme, or private ends, but unto God alone, even
in obedience unto him, and for his glory.</p>
            <p>Thus have I as briefly as I could possibly given
you the true Institution of a thankfull man, his <hi>person</hi>
must be <hi>holy,</hi> his <hi>sacrifice</hi> must be <hi>whole,</hi> made up of
<hi>heart</hi> and <hi>tongue</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> an observing minde, suitable
and enlarged affections, a readie memorie, a tongue
to tell Gods praises, a life using Gods mercies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
abusing none of them, abhorring himself
before God, devoting himself unto God, humbly
waiting upon his ordinances, and according to his
ability, endeavouring to be an Instrument of help
and comfort to him that needeth.</p>
            <p>Now give me leave (Right Honorable and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
to endeavour to set all this home to your hearts
in a double use. First for <hi>Humiliation.</hi> Secondly, for
<hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First for <hi>humiliation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> It may be some will think it
<hi>unseasonable</hi> in a day of rejoycing to put you upon
<hi>sorrow</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. For hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</note> but certainly could I but help
you to be rightly humbled for, and to slay this beast
of Ingratitude, it would be the best <hi>peace-offering</hi>
which ever God received from many of your hands,
neither will you ever be able to give him the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of an <hi>humble contrite heart,</hi> till your spirits be laid
low in the sence of this great sin. Let me speak plain
and in earnest, I remember I speak to a <hi>great assembly,</hi>
to an <hi>assembly of Gods,</hi> but I speak in the name of <hi>a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94564:23"/>
great God,</hi> before whom you are but as so many <hi>gras-hoppers,</hi>
his <hi>potsheards,</hi> his <hi>poore sinfull creatures:</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me (ye great Lords and Gentlemen) if I passe
over all your eminencie, and discharge my dutie; Are
we not a most unthankfull people? Do we render to
God according to his infinite mercies vouchsafed to
us? I could easily set before you great lists and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues
of mercies,<note place="margin">In general our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for all Gods mercies.</note> which you have received; Many
in <hi>common</hi> with the rest of the <hi>world,</hi> Many in <hi>common</hi>
with this <hi>Nation,</hi> to which God hath been mercifull
above all Nations upon earth: Many in <hi>common</hi> with
the <hi>places where you live:</hi> Many <hi>peculiar</hi> to your own
<hi>persons,</hi> to your own <hi>souls</hi> and <hi>bodies,</hi> to your <hi>estates,
families, relations,</hi> privative mercies, positive mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
ye eat mercies, drink mercies, weare mercies,
compassed about and covered with mercies, as much
as ever the earth was with water in the time of <hi>Noahs</hi>
flood. But beloved, where is your thankfulnesse for
all these mercies to be found? I can tell you where
the houses are that are full of mercies, but who can
tell me where true thankfulnesse may be found? May
not God say of you, that for all his goodnesse and
mercies which he hath multiplied and bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, the return is nothing but abominable Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:
let me help you in a few things.</p>
            <p>1. Are there not abundance to be found, who
<hi>take no notice of Gods gracious dealing to them?</hi> either
through the <hi>pride</hi> of their heart, esteeming nothing
worthy of their observation, or having their souls
so <hi>crooked to the earth,</hi> that they cannot look up to
heaven: or through the <hi>peevishnesse</hi> of their spirit
burying ten thousand mercies under one clod of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content:
and so can finde nothing for which they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94564:23"/>
should either rejoyce in God, or love him, or admire
his goodnesse to them?</p>
            <p>2. Are there not abundance whose <hi>tongues</hi> (in stead
of being their <hi>glory,</hi> to exalt God and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
are as it were set on <hi>fire of hell,</hi> depressing his
majestie, reproaching and blaspheming his Name,
and works, his ordinances, and servants, seldome
naming him for his praise,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 11</note> unlesse (when with the
Pharisee) <hi>pretending</hi> to thank God, they <hi>intend</hi> to
commend themselves?</p>
            <p>3. Are there not abundance (even great ones,
Lords, Ladies, Gentlemen) whom God hath singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
and eminently loaden with his mercies, who
with all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>se do nothing but <hi>beare armes to fight
against God</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> against <hi>Goliah)</hi> with his own
sword. <hi>Waters of a full cup are wrang out into them,</hi>
they <hi>prosper in the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> 
               <hi>encrease in riches, they have
all their hearts can desire, therefore pride compasseth
them about as a chain, therefore they are corrupt and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;</hi>
therefore they may swear and drink, dice and
drab. Oh beloved, God hath a tallie of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which you enjoy, a Catalogue of all the favours
which he hath bestowed upon you, and if you be
found to be the people, who thus requite him, who
are thus advanced and work all these abominations,
God will ere long say of you, as <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Nabal,
Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and
he hath requited me evill for good, I will not leave any
thing that pertains to him,</hi> in vain have I done all
which I have done for these men, they have requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me evill for good, <hi>I will strip them naked,</hi> I will
deprive them of all my abused mercies, <hi>I will spend
my arrows, and heap mischiefs</hi> (in stead of mercies) <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94564:24"/>
4. Are there not abundance to whom (this thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
rendring of a <hi>contrite heart,</hi> of <hi>bodies and souls</hi>
consecrated to Gods service, <hi>reverent waiting</hi> upon
him in his ordinances, and <hi>doing good</hi> to others,
thereby to praise God) to whom (I say) these things
are the darkest riddles in the world: who think God
never doth enough for them, and think any thing too
much for them to do to God?</p>
            <p>But to leave this generall complaint,<note place="margin">In speciall our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for these late deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> I beseech
you (Right Honorable and beloved) to see what
great cause we have to be abased concerning our
great Ingratitude, for the admirable mercies which
God hath bestowed us <hi>this very last yeer;</hi> This one
yeer, this wonderfull yeer, wherein God hath done
more for us in some kinds, then in fourescore yeers
before, breaking so many yokes, giving such hopes
and beginnings of a very Jubilee and Resurrection
both of Church and State: <hi>This yeer</hi> wherein we
looked to have been a <hi>wonder</hi> to all the world in our
<hi>desolations,</hi> and God hath made us a <hi>wonder</hi> to the
world in our <hi>preservation:</hi> giving us in one yeer a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the prayers of fourty and fourty yeers. Now
look abroad into the kingdome, enquire (as <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus</hi>
did of <hi>Mordecai) what honour and dignity is done</hi>
to the Lord for all this; my heart would bleed, were
it rightly affected in the expressing of it: We scarce
make any shew of thankfulnesse, but manifest the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power of Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Alas,<note place="margin">For which some are grieved.</note> there are many whose hearts are grieved at
the great things which God hath done for us, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Jubilee</hi> into <hi>Lamentations:</hi> I know not better
how to expresse the spirit of these men, then by that
in the 8. of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 14.</note> Among all the abominations
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94564:24"/>
which the Lord shewed the Prophet,<note place="margin">Churches thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> whereby he
was provoked to go far off from his sanctuary, one
was a company of women <hi>sate weeping for Tammuz,</hi>
they wept because they they had lost their Idoll: so
these grieve because they fear to loose their toyes
and fooleries, which provoke God against us.</p>
            <p>Others bring up an ill report of Gods goodnesse
and his worthy Instruments,<note place="margin">Others sleight.</note> who can see no wood
for trees, ever enquiring in discontent, <hi>what is done all
this yeer,</hi> the Parliament hath sate long, abundance
of money given, but <hi>what have they done for us?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
lesse is done, then might have been, had we
been truly thankfull, but much more is done, then
ever thou or I had cause to hope our eyes should see:
when it is Gods mercie we are not all as Sodome,
art not thou a wretched man, to say what is done by
way of sleighting what thy eyes see this day?</p>
            <p>Others deny not but God hath done great things
this last yeer,<note place="margin">Most abuse.</note> and all their enquirie is, What is to
be done next, who (as swine under the pear-tree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure
all that fals, and whine for more, never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the hand that shakes down to them) in <hi>the
meane time return nothing to God,</hi> abate not an ace of
any of their former courses, whereby God was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
as proud, vain, wanton, worldly, prophane,
this yeer as the last, yea a greater torrent of sin (for
ought I can hear) rusheth in, and fearfully prevails
and domineers in most places. God is free in his
goodnesse, and will be mercifull to whom he will be
mercifull, and the wickednesse of a Nation can set no
bounds or limits to his goodnesse, else we should
certainly conclude, that this <hi>drie winde from the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,</hi>
this ingratitude of ours, would even sweep
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94564:25"/>
and drive away all Gods mercies from us.</p>
            <p>Yea, may I not, must I not (Right Honorable and
Noble Senators) humble you, <hi>even you,</hi> before the
Lord this day, even in <hi>this day</hi> of <hi>your rejoycing,</hi> to
make you begin this your Passeover with eating
some bitter hearbs:<note place="margin">Even the honorable Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for this sin.</note> have you rendred to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the mercies of this yeer? I think <hi>you</hi> may
say of Gods dealing towards <hi>you,</hi> as never Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
could say, God hath carried <hi>you</hi> in his bosome,
prevented and discovered great designes against <hi>you,</hi>
queld great adversaries before <hi>you,</hi> restored great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
unto <hi>you,</hi> appeared as your Councellour in
all <hi>your</hi> darknesses, opened a doore, an out-gate in all
<hi>your</hi> straits: all rubs and stumbling blocks before <hi>you,</hi>
God hath made them but as vantage ground to raise
<hi>you</hi> higher: What should I say? <hi>you</hi> have found your
gracious Soveraigne granting (I think) all your suits
hitherto; <hi>your</hi> Rights and Liberties are establisht,
and <hi>your</hi> houses built, if it were possible <hi>you</hi> should
surpasse the very Angels in thanksgiving. Now let
your servant be bold with <hi>you, what glory and honour
do you return to God?</hi> How have you observed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of your God and King amongst you? With
what admiring thoughts are your hearts filled? what
Reformation appears in your hearts and lives? what
cost are you at for this God? how strongly have
you engaged and consecrated your selves and all
which you have for his service and glory? <hi>Lay your
hand upon your heart,</hi> and think in this your day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
whether your continuance in your old sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wayes, your unbeliefe, your ebbing and flowing
in your spirits, according as humane hopes and helps
have come and gone; your not zealously laying to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94564:25"/>
heart the cause of Christ, his worship and servants,
may not make the Lord say of you (as of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah)</hi>
the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons of England prayed unto
God, and the Lord heard them, and gave them a signe,
but they rendred not again according to the benefits done
unto them:</hi> If it be so, the good Lord humble you
under it, and turn away the guilt of this great sinne
from <hi>you</hi> and from <hi>us all</hi> for Christ Jesus sake, and so
much for the use of <hi>Humiliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> one more for exhortation and I have
done. Oh that I were able to speak something to
raise up your hearts to the practise of this excellent
service, I shall confine my self to these <hi>two heads
First,</hi> a few <hi>Motives</hi> to quicken you to the duty. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
a few <hi>Directions</hi> to guide you in it.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Motives to this duty.</note> the man lives not who owes not this homage
or quit-rent unto God,<note place="margin">1. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it, all owe it unto God.</note> yea even for every thing
which he hath, finde out the man who lies under one
evill so great as he hath deserved, or enjoyes one
mercie which he hath not freely received, and that
man shall go scot-free from the dutie of thankfulnes:
Now even common honesty will call for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of this ingenuous, equall, and easie rent of
Thanksgiving to men who are but <hi>Instruments</hi> of
mercie, how much more to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>welspring and
fountain</hi> of them all.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The excellency of it.</note> consider the excellency of the duty,
what a <hi>high</hi> and <hi>honourable service</hi> it is, so high that
though God be most worthy to be praised, yet no
creature is found worthy to praise him. In our praises
we are said to <hi>blesse, honour, exalt, magnifie,</hi> and <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
God; can any creature be thought worthy or able
to do this? to <hi>lift up God,</hi> to <hi>make him a great God;</hi> to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94564:26"/>
put <hi>glory upon God,</hi> yet God so interprets it, <hi>he that
praiseth me honoureth me.</hi> Yea so excellent is this duty,
that it is the onely imployment of all the glorious
host of heaven.<note place="margin">Psal. 50. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> It is said in the Psalme, that <hi>man did
eat Angels food;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 25.</note> sure I am, this is to do <hi>Angels work,</hi>
heavens work, to bring heaven down to earth, and to
raise up poore dust to heaven, to be enabled to praise
the Lord; what should I say more? this praising of
God is by Interpretation, the doing of all that God
requires. <hi>Tully</hi> said that Gratitude to man is <hi>Maxima
&amp; mater omnium reliquarum virtutum.</hi> But what ever
Gratitude to man be, the Scriptures teach us, that
gratitude to God is the comprehension of all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly,<note place="margin">The fruit of it.</note> it is the <hi>comfortablest duty</hi> that ever
we can perform, partly, because it is the <hi>sweetest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
of our sincere love and faithfull dependance
upon God: we may pray for base self-love, when we
love not God, but his gifts, but a cordiall praising
of him, is a reall expression of our love to him; and
partly, because God <hi>graciously accepts</hi> what ever
comes under the notion of praise, a female, or turtle,
a handfull of wheat floure, a pepper corn, a cup of
cold water, a sigh or teare, is most kindly accepted
when presented as a peace-offering: I will praise God
with a <hi>song,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 69. 30</note> this shall please the Lord better then an
<hi>ox</hi> or a <hi>bullock</hi> that hath horns and hoofs. Who that
loves God, would stick at any thing in this duty so
acceptable unto him: It is pitifull to observe what
pains and cost many poore seduced <hi>Papists</hi> are at out
of a false conceit of <hi>meriting</hi> for themselves and
theirs, should not <hi>love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God and our
Lord Jesus, (who hath merited all for us) be more
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94564:26"/>
prevalent with us, then <hi>self-love</hi> and <hi>blinde superstition</hi>
in them.</p>
            <p>4 Fourthly, I have one Motive more especially
to presse upon you according to the duty of the day,<note place="margin">The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this yeer in speciall manner call for it.</note>
the consideration of the <hi>wonders,</hi> (I had almost said
the <hi>miracles)</hi> of this last yeer: Could I lively draw
them before your eyes, that you might see what this
yeer God hath done <hi>for you,</hi> and wrought <hi>by you,</hi> such
whose affections are <hi>lame</hi> among you <hi>would leap as
an Hart, and the tongue of the dumbe would sing.</hi> This
yeer we have seen the <hi>three Nations of England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and Ireland</hi> in a posture of warre <hi>without blood.
shed,</hi> Oh wonderfull! This yeer we have seen our
neighbour <hi>Nation</hi> come into England in a <hi>hostile shew</hi>
with <hi>peaceable hearts,</hi> oh wonderfull! This yeer we
have seen the same Nation (after all <hi>mistakes</hi> cleared)
received into the bosome of their Soveraignes <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
their <hi>loyalty</hi> and <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> acknowledged,
and with a <hi>friendly aid</hi> honorably and peaceably sent
to their own homes, and the two Nations faster <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi>
together in a league of love then ever hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
oh wonderfull! Nay yet more, this yeer have
we seen broken <hi>the yokes</hi> which lay upon our estates,
Liberties, Religion, and Conscience; the intolerable
yokes of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and <hi>terrible High-commission</hi>
and their <hi>Appendances;</hi> unsufferable pressures to many
thousands, all eased, removed, broken and swept
away. This yeer have we seen the two houses of
Parliament (and many ten thousands in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
following their example) enter into a <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
promise and vow for defence of Gods true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
against all <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Popish Innovations and
superstition.</hi> This yeer the Complaints of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94564:27"/>
outcast, persecuted, and afflicted</hi> we have seen
and heard, tenderly received into the high and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Court of Parliament, and the <hi>faces</hi> of many
<hi>proud enemies</hi> covered with shame. This yeer for
preventing future grievances, the Lord hath put it
into the heart of our <hi>gracious Soveraigne,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi>
and <hi>Commons</hi> all to agree upon a <hi>Trienniall Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and this present Parliament to continue <hi>till</hi> all
things be rightly established both in <hi>Church and
Common-wealth,</hi> that the foundations of the Land
may be no more out of joynt, that Liberty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
henceforth receive no dammage, unlesse the
State (like the foolish woman in the proverbe)
plucks it down with their own hands. <hi>Quadragesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
primus mirabilis annus.</hi> Oh wonderfull yeer! and
so much the <hi>more wonderfull</hi> that all these things are
done for us, <hi>when</hi> our <hi>neighbour Nations</hi> round about
us see no such dayes, when <hi>Germany</hi> remains a field
of blood, when their Cities and Towns are desolate,
their wives ravished, their children kill'd, when many
of them eat their dead carcasses, and die for want of
food, yea when Gods sword rides in circuit round
about us, these great things are done for us, and
hopes of greater: And which is <hi>most wonderfull,</hi> all
this done for the most unworthy and unthankfull
Nation in all the world, our God hath thus broke in
over all the walls of separation which our sins have
built up against us, and called for vengeance upon
us.</p>
            <p>Me thinks (Right Honourable and beloved) eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of your <hi>hearts</hi> should say to <hi>God,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>thou hast been carefull for us
with all this care, what is to be done for thee?</hi> Lord what
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94564:27"/>
wouldst thou have us do to testifie that we are sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of thy goodnesse? Oh praise the Lord.</p>
            <p>5. And the rather, because else God knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all these mercies may not be removed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and miserie yet break in upon us. When
<hi>Tamar</hi> was to be delivered, and twins in her wombe,
<hi>Zarah</hi> first put forth his hand, and they tyed a scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
threed about it, and said this came out first, but
his hand was plucked in again, and his brother broke
out before him. So mercie and judgement, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and ruine, have seem'd to be long strugling in
the wombe which should first break out upon us:
Deliverance hath now put forth the hand, and we
have tyed our scarlet threed about it, and say this
came out first: Oh that <hi>Ingratitude</hi> cause not this
hand to be plucked back again, and destruction yet
to break in upon us. Ingratitude that, <hi>Obex Inferna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
as Divines call it, that <hi>hellish stop</hi> may interrupt
the course of all Gods mercies. According to what
God hath threatned:<note place="margin">Jer. 18. 9, 10.</note> that though <hi>he speak concerning
a Nation to build and plant it, if that Nation do evill in
his sight, he will repent of the good wherewith he said he
would benefit them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Directions for the practise of it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What then is to be done? or wherewith
shall we be thankfull? <hi>Answ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Chrysostome</hi> once desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he had a voice to speak to all the <hi>world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. To the honorable house of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I
could wish that my voice could speak to all the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
that I might tell them what God expects from
all their hands.<note place="margin">To shew thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition &amp; office.</note> But though that cannot be, I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this day to speak to you, (Right Honorable and
beloved) who are the <hi>Representative Body of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
and whose thankfulnesse will be interpreted
by God and man to be the thankfulnesse of the whole
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94564:28"/>
kingdome; you must think of some such way of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God, as becomes your high places and callings,
and the whole kingdome which you represent: if
single persons praise God upon a <hi>ten stringed</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you must do it upon a <hi>ten thousand stringed</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument:
some thing worthy of a <hi>Parliament of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
such a Parliament,</hi> for whom God hath done
such great things. When <hi>King Solomon</hi> offers a
peace-offering he brings <hi>two and twenty thousand fat
beeves, and an hundred and twenty thousand fat sheep,</hi>
there is thankfulnesse fit for a King to shew.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 22. 14.</note> And
when <hi>David</hi> would shew his Gratitude to God in
preparing to build him an house, he offered <hi>a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
thousand talents of silver, and an hundred thousand
talents of gold,</hi> which comes to above three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thousand cart-load of silver, allowing two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
weight or six thousand pound sterling to every
load; and of gold seventy millions of French crowns,
<hi>besides brasse and iron without weight:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 29. 12.</note> And when he
and his people had added much more unto it, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
Gods goodnesse <hi>to give them a heart to offer so
willingly,</hi> and excuses the smalnesse of his own gift as
<hi>being prepared in a time of trouble.</hi> Let not therefore
your Thankfulnesse be in <hi>trifles, lowprizd,</hi> serve not
God <hi>with that which costs you nothing.</hi> And if indeed
you would do something heroicall, worthy of your
selves, take <hi>him</hi> for your pattern, who for his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
was called <hi>the man after Gods own heart,</hi> and
that is <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Following the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
               </note> who (when God had delivered him
from all his enemies, and established him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome)
expresses in the hundred and first Psalme,
wherein his thankfulnesse should appeare, weigh the
Psalme seriously, it comprehends the sum of what I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94564:28"/>
have to say to you. <hi>I will sing</hi> (saith he) <hi>of mercie and
judgement,</hi> that is, I will celebrate thankfully all Gods
mercifull administrations unto my soul: how would
he do this? Answ. In binding himself in his rule of
walking towards <hi>three sorts</hi> of persons with whom he
had to do. First, <hi>himself.</hi> Secondly, <hi>his family.</hi> And
thirdly, <hi>his kingdome.</hi> For his own person he would
be <hi>holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> he would walk uprightly in the midst of his
house. For his family he would have <hi>no wicked person
about him,</hi> no slanderers, liars, proud, or deceitfull
persons, he would root them out as <hi>pests</hi> to his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
And he would search throughout the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to have his family stored with good servants.
Thirdly, for his kingdome, he would <hi>root out wicked
men</hi> without exception of persons, and that early,
that so his whole kingdome might be a City of the
Lord, a people with whom God might delight to
dwell. Here is an example fit for a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to follow, oh that God would encline your
hearts this day to resolve to begin first with your
<hi>own persons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> else you will never be sincere for the
rest:<note place="margin">1. Their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> Now God hath called you and separated you
for his work, be not the vassals of Satan, factors or
pensioners for his enemy, who hath thus far be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you. Secondly, look to <hi>your families,</hi> do as <hi>Jacob</hi>
did at <hi>Bethel,</hi> when he payed his vow of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
unto God, he made all his family bury their
Idols under an oke; that so when hereafter any of you
shall be mentioned,<note place="margin">Gen. 35.</note> it may truly be said, such a <hi>Noble-man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Their families.</note> such a <hi>Parliament man, and the Church in his
house,</hi> that your families may be little Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Saints, with whom God may delight to dwel:
Not like Taverns and Alehouses, houses of lewd and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94564:29"/>
debaucht persons, where <hi>Zim,</hi> and <hi>Jim</hi> dwels, dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

much feared many of them are untill this day.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. The Church and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> then look to <hi>sweep the Church and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi>
blessed be God you have begun well, you have
been happie Instruments to ease many pressures; But
beloved, there is yet much work to be done, yet the
root of our evils is not taken away, yet the Ministery
is not purged, yet the great Cities and Towns, and
many thousand other places in the kingdome want
bread for their souls,<note place="margin">Nehem. 12. 10.</note> and the portions of the Levites,
honorable maintenance for them who should do the
work of the Lord in many places are not yet provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
yet there remains much rubbish to be carried
away, as yet the honour of the Lords day is not fully
vindicated, as yet the Lords Temple is not builded,
nor the Scepter of Christ throughly set up. These
are services fit for a thankfull <hi>Parliament,</hi> if you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
these, and cause a cessation in building the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and let it lie unfinished, as it was in <hi>Cyrus</hi> his
dayes, if there be a <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rez-Vzizah,</hi> a breach in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Ark of God unto us: Now you have built
your own house, and procured Civill Liberties,
should you let Gods house lie waste, should you be
(as many fear you are) lesse zealous in Gods cause,
then in your own, I solemnly professe unto you, the
God of heaven will require it at your hands, and the
hands of your posteritie: he will <hi>curse all your bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,

But the people of God in whose hearts and prayers
you daily are, expect and hope for these great things
from you: This do in the fear of the Lord, and ye

2. This (Right Honorable) is that I had to say to

how you shall testifie your thankfulnesse.<note place="margin">To all others to expresse their thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> I answer, if

I think you shall do well.<note place="margin">In rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</note> But this I beseech you do,
go home and pray God to encline the hearts of the

write down a Catalogue of all the great things
which God hath this yeer done for us, and let your

them,<note place="margin">In remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances.</note> that the present and future generation may be
blessed with a true <hi>Narration</hi> of these wonderfull

<hi>Then had the Churches rest</hi> and peace; and what use
