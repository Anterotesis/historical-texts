            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Will you ſyt ſir, and I wilbee next you? <hi>Or thus:</hi>

               <p>And if it be one that be of great eſtimation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for office, or ancientie, and will yet of too mutch curioſitie refuſe the place, then it ſhalbee beſt to ſyt downe firſt, but to take a lower place either on the other ſide, or on the ſame ſide. But here (by the way) it is to be conſidered that this curteſy is not ſo preciſely to bee vſed, either at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon tables, where eche man payeth equally for his meale, nor yet at ordenary tables in the court: for in either of theſe two places, except di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie

Howbeit, if the owner ſhall call or place one (eyther not knowinge who ought or not caringe who doe) that is inferiour euery way, ſauing for wealth, in ſutch a caſe, the younge Gentleman ſhall doe well not to tarry till other bee ſet, not abydinge the placinge of the owner: but takinge his nexte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion to ſet himſelf downe firſt, rather two or three lower, then hee ſhould bee the next to his inferiour: wherby the owner ſhalbee (in ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) taught to conſyder better an other time.

But if there bee mutch adoe made, and that hee finde the owner to finde his owne errour: then it wilbee curteſy to couller the fact with good wordes pleaſaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>As thus:</hi>

               <p>Beware freinds, pride will haue a fale: ſpeake not ſo lowde your betters bee in place. And to conclude, to make as mutch mirth and paſtime as may be all the meale. But if a man bee in a noblemans houſe, or a knight of great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, then hee muſt bee contented for that time, as pleaſeth them. But hee may the nexte time, take as good a place as hee can with modeſtie get, and when hee is from the bourd, not looſe

any place that reaſon or courage can aduaunce him to. For as no man is diſgraced by giuing (of his curteſy) place to whom hee liſt, ſo to haue it taken from him by others being his right, is an abaſement not to bee ſuffred, it a man can take it either by ſlight or courage.</p>
               <p>Now that this young Gentleman, may know in what ſorte hee may accompany himſelf with all ſortes, and to all eſtates: hee ſhal know, that the eldeſt ſonne of a knight while his father li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, may count himſelfe equall with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of. cc. li. land rent of aſſiſe (for ſo the ſtatute limiteth) and may offer himſelfe a companion with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt ſquire, if his wit w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> a modeſt auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie wil ſerue him ther to, but not without ſome reuerent reſpectes in his ſpeeche: ſpecially if the ſayd ſquier bee of grauity, and ſo of reputacyon, either for his wiſdome or office, as if he wil aſke a queſtion, <hi>thus:</hi>

               <p>With a good will, if it pleaſe you, &amp;c. As the matter ſhall fall out. Howbeit theſe ſpeeches, if it bee to no better then to the beſt ſquier, or an

And though theſe kynde of reuerent ſpeeches neede not to bee ſo curiouſly vſed, by the inferiour, to one mutche his better, when they bee once very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milier: yet they become the ſpeaker ſo well, as if they bee vſed with a good audacitie and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier countenance, a man may vſe them to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, without any abacement or diſgrace at all to himſelf, and ſpecially to Ladies and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle women of credit.</p>
               <p>Then hee hath to conſider that among yonge Gentlemen, or younge Noblemen, there needes no great curioſity, but before a Barron, and ſo vpward, he may not bee couered while he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in his viewe, except the nobleman bid him: vnles that Nobleman vſe ſutch an ordinarye kinde of good fellowſhip with all men (as hee ſeeth) as meane as himſelfe vſe him with ſmal curteſy: and yet hee muſt way withall whither that goodfellowſhip bee withall men indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, or only to ſutch as bee his familliers: for ſutch as be noble may make their companions whom they liſt, and the reſt though they ſhalbe better to ſutch companions, not to vſe euer the leſſe honour to him. And let this ſtand for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11140:9"/>
rule, that whatſoeuer familiarity a noble man ſhal ſhow to any his inferiour, yea though he profeſſe to make him his equall freind: let y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> inferiour ſtill beware of vſinge himſelfe rudely, ſawcely or careleſly, eſpecially in the preſence of others. For though many to aſſure their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of their goodwil, ſeeme to baniſh all curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity: yet ſutch an one ſhalbe beſt eſteemed, and longeſt hold freindſhip with his better, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in all their greateſt familiarity can make it appeare to others that hee doth not forget, that he play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or ieſteth with his ſuperiour. Which a man may very well doe and yet holde company in all manner of ſportes, ieſtes, and paſtimes: then mutch more hee that is a ſtraunger muſt haue the more regarde. And as it is good manner for a man in his owne houſe, or his freindes, if hee bee the beſt in the company, to offer intertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any nobleman: ſo in a ſtraunge place in the houſe of his better, though there bee no better then himſelfe in the place, hee may not preſume to beginne intertainment: but it is his part to bee ready, and nexte the Nobleman in ſight, agaynſt it pleaſeth him to vſe him, till hee ſeeth him accompanied with ſome others, or call ſome other to him: and if it bee but open talke deuiſed to paſſe awaye the time, then to helpe lengthen the ſame at his diſcretion: other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyſe to finde ſome talke with others, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtande or ſit, with a ſteddy and aſſured countenaunce, as though hee were ſtudiynge ſome matter of waight, or harkening to others
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11140:10"/>
talke if it bee not ſecret: then to accompany him ſelfe with ſutch as bee vnwoorthy of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: and ſutch count I ſeruing men, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh doltiſh perſons though they be his betters, But when a man ſhall ſit ſtill and ſay nothing, hee muſt bee ſure to haue an aſſured counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, not gnawing any thinge in his mouth, or playing with his legges, toes or fingers, and to haue alwaies an eare and an eye about him, to here what is ſayde, and to bee reddy if anye part of an others talke, eyther by word or looke bee addreſſed to him, that hee may receyue the occaſion, and winne in the talke: and though no ſuch cauſe bee offred, yet it is a better grace to harken other folkes communication, then to be talkyng with a perſon of vayne credit: and if a man ſhall get him out of the way for lacke of countenance, when noble perſons or others of reputacion be in place: then will his inferiour lye in a wayte for occaſion, and ſtep in, to bee of familiaritie before him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if talke be offred to this yonge Gentilman by his better, hee hath to conſyder whether the ſame proceede of a deſire to paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time, and for want of other companie: or els (as ſome do) bicauſe they wilbe thought curteous, they will ſay ſome thyng to euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but for feare of too mutch familiaritie, will not ſtay longe with their inferiour. To this laſt it ſhalbee good only to anſwer to the queſtion, addyng ſome reaſon to verefie the ſame, but not to enter any new matter, nor to dilate any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in the olde, then hee ſhall perceiue him by his countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and attentiuenes to heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prouocation. But if the inferiour perceiue, that the talke is miniſtred vpon the firſt reſpect, that is to make entertaynment: hee muſt not only anſwere all his demaunds, but enlarge the ſame to the vttermoſt: And when hee ſeeth his better pawſe, ſo that hee turne not awaywarde (as though hee would begon from him) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ſome matter of himſelf, to lengthen talke: And that hee may the better do ſo, hee muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hande haue enquired (of ſutche as come in<note place="margin">In any wiſe let a man ſhun as much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, that when they tell a tale of an other mans mouth, hee forbeare to tell the name of his aucthor eſpecially, if hee bee his freind, for if it ſhall ſeeme vnlikely though it bee true, he ſhal bryng his freindes credit in ſuſpect. The thyrd kinde is, that hee neuer take vpon him in open preſence, to make any report of the ſayinges or dooynges of his betters, except they bee ſutch as the company knoweth him to bee familliarly acquainted with, for otherwiſe, hee ſhall make himſelfe compared to them that talke of Robyn Hoode and neuer ſhot in his bowe. Laſtly let him neuer make vp his entertaynments with the diſprayſe, or mockyng of any, either preſent, or abſent, though hee heare other doo the like, (except only in the companie of his very aſſured freinds) and that for this reſpect. A yonge man muſt euer thinke that it is vnpoſſible for him to bee ſo compleat in all perfections of beehauour, but that ſome thynge remaynes in him worthy the laughyng at, if men ſhould not forbeare him in reſpect of time, which brynges experience to the wiſeſt, and peraduenture too, euen ſome of

For anſwer hereunto, let this bee remembred, that where as I haue ſayd, that men muſt take

heede in their open talke, how they bee to buſy in bryngyng in the ſayinges and doinges of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons, leaſt the hearers ſhould thinke that hee arrogateth to himſelf greater acquaintance with ſutche, then in deede hee hath: or els, leaſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng to theyr eares, they ſhould miſlike that their inferiours ſhould make them their talking ſtockes. Yet if hee that ſhall ſo introduce (by way of confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, enſample, or ſimilitude) the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of his betters, bee ſure that it ſhew his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prayſe, or at the leaſt, ſome pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe without any harme or diſgrace to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee may well vſe it in his talke: Prouided that hee ſpeake it as by hereſay, except he haue it in deede by his owne knowledge. Alſo wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and deformed perſons, may bee pleaſanted and ieſted with, if their wit bee ſutche as they delight in the like, and can in good ſporte enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge in the ſame manner.

               <p>Alſo, all men in ſickenes, priſonment, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, bee not miſerable, for they bee only ſutch that haue an afflicted minde: for ſome can ieſt and ſcoffe at their owne diſgraces, thinkynge thereby to make them ſeeme the leſſe in other mens eyes, while they appeare no heuier, then ſutche as themſelues can pleaſantly beare: And ſutche had rather bee ieſted with, then pittied.</p>
               <p>The fault therfore that can bee committed in theſe perſons, is the mockynge them beehinde their backes, or deſpiſyng them, which no man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11140:13"/>
ought to ſhew to any, except it bee to them that be knowen to bee impudent and ſhameleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or els ſutche as bee knowen to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenyng fooles in theyr owne conceyte, and bee ſutche as doo the like by others. Of theſe a man may talke his pleaſure, as well of them, as with them, without any diſgrace to himſelf: Prouided that if any quarell riſe thereby, hee be as readie of courage to mayntayne it with his hand, as of ſpeeche to vtter it with his tongue.</p>
               <p>Alſo a man may ieſt with his very famillier freinde, if hee finde him of diſpoſicion willynge to beare it, and of wit ſufficient to anſwer it. And it ſkilles not what hee lay to his charge, though it bee diſhoneſtie: prouided that it bee not true that is imputed to him, or if it bee true that the other bee ſo braſon faced as hee wil not bee aſhamed of it.</p>
               <p>I would not aduiſe any man to ieſt mutche with his inferiours, vnleſſe they bee ſutch as he knoweth, both can and will vſe a reſtraint of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer malepartnes. For if a gentilman ſhould bee ſaucely vſed by ieſt, by his inferiour, hee cannot eſcape diſgrace, whether hee beare with it, or quarell for it: but bearyng it is beſt, and to ſhut it vp rather with a pleaſant nip, then any way to ſeeme angry, if the myrth bee of his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng.</p>
               <p>And thus mutch for a taſte how a man may paſſe his talke amonge his betters and equals, in a ſtraunge place, and in ſtraunge company.</p>
               <p>Yet this admonition more I muſt adde, that

And as though he were the plaineſt honeſt man in the company, hee will offer to quarrell with them in his behalfe: and all will bee donne with ſutch oathes and ſad lookes as for all a man is warned (hee ſhall doubt) whither there bee any that meane good fayth or not.

euery wiſe man will ſuſpecte any man that too mutch praiſeth him (except it be his famillier and aſſured freinde) but for the more ſuerty it ſhalbe wel to anſwer in this manner: not ſeriouſly, but ſomewhat ſmyling and famillierly. Mee thinks it very good that you and I were neuer better acquainted: for by that meanes you may bee kept in that good opinion which now yee ſeeme to conceiue of mee, either by hereſay, or by your owne gueſſe, leaſt by too much conuerſation you be made to chainge your minde: but in the mean time I thanke you, both of your good lykinge, and of the good aduice you profer mee: for I ſhall euer haue neede of good counſell: and if there be any other thinge (becauſe I am vnfurniſhed to requite you in the ſame) wherin I may pleaſure you as mutch, you ſhall finde mee as ready. And ſo to ſhift him of and fall into ſome other talke, enquiring of this or that, him or her, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte of the eye or minde ſhall lead.</p>
               <p>Now for the wonder tellers, I finde three or foure ſortes of them: the one ſort only vpon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to paſſe away the time, not lookinge to bee beleeued of any, but to be iolled within the lyke: With theſe the beſt way is meerely to take vpon you to know it to bee true, and to ad to it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge that may make it ſeeme more vnlikely. And though it ſhould ſo fall out that the tale ſhould bee true, that to another ſeemeth either vnlike or vnpoſſible: yet is there no harme done, in not ſeeming to beleeue it, while I knowe no reaſon to lead mee therto: mary, if after the ſame

with ſad aſſeueracion and others bee iuſtified to bee true: a man muſt of curteſie ſeeme to credit their others, but neuer the more to confeſſe it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, except they can ſhew ſo by reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thother ſorte for that they would bee taken for dooers or knowers of great thinges, will for their owne glorye tell maruels, either of ſutche thinges as they haue done, or ſutch thinges as they haue ſeene in ſtraunge Countries. And will thinke in deede, what by his ſolemne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, what by ſwearing and lyinge, eyther to bee credited, or at leaſt that no man ſhall ſeeme to diſcredit them: and if any go aboute it to quarrell with them. In this caſe I would either ſay nothynge, or if hee ſhould direct his tale to mee, whereby I muſt bee drouen to ſay ſomethynge: I ſhould bee in ſurche ſorte as I would ſeeme to ſoothe him in woordes, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſutch as I thought my freindes, ſhould perceiue by my countenance I rather thought it pittie to put him out of his vayne, then was of the minde to beleeue all hee ſayd. Yet that muſt bee done ſo conningly too, that if the teller or the hearers ſhould, to picke a thanke, chalenge mee for the ſame: I would be able (if I lyſt) without denyinge any thinge I ſayde or did, or make the blame light on them that would goe about to diſtayne my meaning, <hi>as thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can I not looke on ſutch a one, or ſpeake ſo, but that I muſt meane as ye would: it is you (me thinkes) that go aboute to brynge in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that which no man els thought on, if I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11140:16"/>
were as hee, I would thanke you for that &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The thirde, and the worſt of theſe wonder tellers, is hee that in very deede maketh it his art, of purpoſe to catche Woodcockes (as they terme it) and they will vſe it either ſo connyngly or ſo impudently, as they will make him, whom they hunt after to be a wole in that poynte, or ſeeme a foole: for they wil ſo mingle thinges like to bee true, or at the leaſt not impoſſible with thinges merely, faulſe and vnpoſſible: as if the hearer ſhall either receiue all indifferently, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect all indifferently, he ſhall ſeeme either too ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or too light of beeleif. And if hee ſhall by iudgement ſcan and ſeuer the other from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſo condemne any parte, though not the whole: then ſwearyng, flowtyng and quare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge, wilbee offred to iuſtifie the matter: and this it is (will they ſay) to tell a tale to him that hath neuer gon further then his mother and nurſery, to call for his pappe in a mornyng. &amp;c. And then muſt the laſt man that I firſt ſpake of and is the fourth in this tragedie, ſteppe foorthe and tell his felow hee offreth the yonge Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man too mutche wronge, and hee ſhall not take it at his handes, and himſelf will take his part, and go into the field, either with him or for him.</p>
               <p>To ſhift bothe theſe of, the beſt way (if any will rid it) is firſt to let the other to tell all his lies, &amp; to let him paſſe with a ſmile in the ſleelie, (as they will call it) rather then to vſe either admiration, affirmation, or negation: but if hee bee vrged to ſay his opinion, as hee ſhall (if it be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11140:16"/>
a verſe of courſe) then ſhortly to anſwer, <hi>thus: or the like:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay no more, but it may bee true for me: for there bee many thinges that ſeeme vnpoſſible, and yet proue true. Matters of faith may not be reaſoned on, <hi>Or thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mee thinkes it is a very good tale, I meane not to ſcan any further on the matter. And theſe or the like woords may bee vttered with ſutche a grace, as the countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may ſhew the minde, and yet the ſpeeche keepe them from quarell. But if they will needes proſecute it to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: then hee that ſhall ſeeme to ſet the yonge Gentleman a gog, and offer to bee his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, hee muſt of curteſie ſeeme to thanke him, but not bee ſo vnwiſe as accept him. For no wiſe man will accept into his companie, at ſutche a bargen, a ſtraunger if he haue any of his freinds to make accompt of, though hee ſuſpect no prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe at all, but yet hee muſt bee put of with good woordes, <hi>as thus:</hi>

               <p>I thanke you, you ſhal not neede to take the payne, for I haue promiſed a freend of myne, in theſe caſes (if I take any body with mee) it<note place="margin">* There is a difference betweene ruffa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly phra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes and ſuch reprocheful woords as expreſſe the fowleneſſe of the fact or the ilneſſe of the perſon.</note> muſt bee hee: I will quarell with no body, but if any body haue any quarell to mee, I haue bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe into ſutche a place, ſutche a day, at ſutche an hower: I wil haue but my ſelfe and my man, or but my ſelfe and my freinde, there hee may finde mee if hee dare: and ſo aſmutch as may bee to forbeare ruffainly words. But if any man bee called by any reprochefull names they muſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11140:17"/>
needes bee requited both in termes and deedes but after ſundrie manners accordynge to the perſon, the cauſe and the place.</p>
               <p>For if a mans better, beyng a noble perſon<note place="margin">If the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man bee not of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> (not beeyng of the counſell) ſhall in ſcornefull woords chalenge his inferiour for any thing of offence towarde him, the inferiour ought by all meanes (not abaceing himſelf too mutch) to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the matter. Or if it bee a fault (ſutche as he can yeelde no reaſon for the committynge of it) to yeelde with requeſt of pardon.

               </p>

For I confeſſe you bee able to ouermatche mee: your traine is longer then mine: if I had thought you would haue vſed mee thus, your Lordſhip ſhould haue pardoned mee for comming to you at that time.</p>
               <p>Now it is to bee conſidered that woordes al this while as they breake no boanes (ſo from one mutche a mans better) they bee no greate diſgraces: and a man may bee compted the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to forbeare, where hee knoweth hee ſhall by

               <p>Now if between equals, reprochefull words doo riſe, it muſt bee diſtinguiſhed <hi>thus:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I giue one occaſion of offence that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth but his profit, and hee giue mee reproche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full names for it, as the Lie, or knaue: I muſt for my credit ſake, not only requite thoſe words with like woordes, but counte the wrong mine:<note place="margin">The beſt way to this is to lende him a blow.</note> and either offer the firſt blowe (if the place ſerue for it) or els chalenge him into the feild: vnleſſe I can (for pollicie ſake) driue him to chalenge me to ſaue my ſelfe from the daunger of the lawe. For fighting quarels neuer are made for profit, but for honour: and therfore whatſoeuer hurt bee doone, not touching credit, the quarel muſt bee his that receiueth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſt reprocheful words: ſo touching the cauſe, the right conſyderation is this: If I offer the firſt reproche, diſdaine, or diſpite, the quarell is the others: his parte it is to chalenge, and I neede not to my equall to make the chalenge. But if the other giue mee the firſt lie, or like diſgrace, it is not inough to ſay hee lieth againe: but I muſt needs offer a blow, or chalenge the feeild.</p>
               <p>If an inferiour offer his better ill ſpeeche, though the better began with him: yet he muſt not doo with him as with his equall: that is, to tarie till hee make the chalenge: but hee muſte

               <p>But if his inferiour be no Gentleman, he may chuſe without any imputation of cowardiſe, whether hee wil either chalenge him, or receaue any chalenge at his handes: but turne one of his men to him, except that inferiour bee ſo well eſteemed for his valiancie, as the Gentleman may be thought, if hee haue not otherwiſe tried himſelfe to make refuſall for feare.

               <p>Firſt I will diſcriue ſome ſundrie manner of ieſtyng.

               <p>¶ An other kynde of ieſtynge with a mans friende is, when they charge him to haue ſayde or donne ſomething of a thirde perſon, that only himſelfe and his freinde knoweth to bee fayned: but yet it may bee tould with ſutche a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of truthe, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearers may doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee true or no.

               <p>I like you well, for I ſee you loue to make the beſt of any thinge, euer, when you wote not how to make the woorſt, <hi>Or thus:</hi>

               <p>I pray you beleeue him in this, and you ſhal ſee hee will take ſutch a pride in it, that hee will quoyne you newe ſtaffe euerie day. <hi>Or to a mans better:</hi> Uery well, you may ſay that and more too, if it pleaſe you, <hi>Or thus:</hi>

               <p>You muſt looke with a ſadder countenance when you wilbee beleeued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:11140:21"/>An other kynde is when they will touche one with ſomethyng which is true: and though it be no great infamie, yet it may bee ſomewhat that a man would bee loathe to confeſſe, and yet as loathe to bee taken for a denier of that which is knowen to bee true. In this caſe a man may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere <hi>thus:</hi>

               <p>O nay, but if you had had the handlyng of it it would haue been exquiſitiuely doone. <hi>Or to a mans better thus:</hi>

               <p>Wel, if a man chaunce to ſhew all the wit he hath in dooing of a thinge, were it reaſon there ſhould bee any more required? <hi>Or thus:</hi>

               <p>I may tell to you, I did it withall the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of wit I had at that tune in ſtore, <hi>Or thus:</hi>

               <p>Another kinde of ieſtyng is to prayſe a man to his face of thinges that bee true in deede: as for his perſonage, his wit, his qualities, his good nature, or his learninge: and whether this hee ſpoken in ſporte, or in earneſt, it is all one: for a man muſt euer take vpon him as though all praiſes were ſpoken in ieſt: by which meanes he may in ſport arrogate them all to himſelfe, with leſſe glorie, then it with taking it in earneſt hee ſhould endeuour to put them from him.
