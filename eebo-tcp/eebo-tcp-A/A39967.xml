            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Doe firſt preſent my moſt humble thanks to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Aſſembly, for this favour vouchſaſed mee in granting me admittance to their preſence, and do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech them to believe it is no deſire to preſerve my ſelfe, or my fortune, but to deſerve the good opinion of thoſe that have drawne me hither. I doe profeſſe, in the preſence of him that knoweth all hearts, I had rather goe from dore to dore, and crave <hi>Daobulum Bellizario,</hi> with the good will of this aſſembly, then enjoy all the Honours and Fortunes I am capable of.</p>
            <p>I doe not come hither with an intention to juſtifie my words, my actions or opinions, but to make a plaine and cleare narration of my ſelfe, and there humbly to ſubmit to the wiſedome and Juſtice of this Houſe, my ſelfe and all that concernes me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96306:3"/>
But this Houſe will not take words, but with cleare and Ingenious dealing.</p>
            <p>And therfore <hi>I</hi> ſhall beſeerh them to think that I come not hither with a ſet or ſtudied ſpeech. <hi>I</hi> come to ſpeake my heart, and to ſpeake it clearely, and plainly, and then to leave it to your clemency and juſtice, and I hope if any thing ſhall ſlippe from me (to work contrary to my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Intention diſorderly or ill placed) you will bee pleaſed to make a favourable Conſtruction, and leave mee the liberty of explanation (if there ſhall be any) but I hope there ſhall be no cauſe for it.</p>
            <p>I hope for my affection in Religion, no man doubteth me: What my education was, and under whom I lived for many yeares, as well known eI lived neere thirty years in the Society of <hi>Grayes-Inne;</hi> and if one (that was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Preacher there in my time, <hi>Doctor Sibs)</hi> were now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, he were able to give Teſtimony to this Houſe, that when a party ill affected in Religion ſought to tyre and weary him out, he had his chiefeſt encouragement, and help from me. I have M. Speaker bin now 15 yeares of the Kings Councell; from the firſt houre to this minute, no man is able to ſay, that ever I was either Author, deviſer, or conſenter to any project.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed the King, my gracious Maſter, after I had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him divers yeares, to preferre me to two places; firſt to be chiefe Juſtice of the Common Pleas; and then Lord Keeper of his Great Seale: I ſay it in the preſence of God, I was ſo farre from the thought of the one, and the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other, that if my Maſter the King, his Grace and goodneſſe had not beene, I had never enjoyed thoſe Honours.</p>
            <p>In all that time, I may ſpeake it with a Confidence, theſe hands never touched bribe nor reward, theſe eyes were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver blinded with guiſt, I took heed to theſe affections, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96306:3"/>
to man, which are apteſt to miſlead a Judge, <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and hatred, neither in the owne, nor the other have I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that know me, know me farre from a vindicative nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> cannot know, M. Speaker, what particulars there are by which you have an ill opinion of mee, and therefore <hi>I</hi> ſhall come very weakely armed: Yet theſe, that either in my owne knowledge or ſuch knowledge as is given me, and not from any of this houſe, <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpeake ſomewhat that <hi>I</hi> hope, being truth and accompanied with cleareneſſe and ingenuity, will at the laſt proceed ſome allay in that ill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which may perhaps be conceived of me.</p>
            <p>M. Speaker, <hi>I</hi> had once the honour to ſit in that place, from the firſt time <hi>I</hi> came hither, to the unfortunate houre <hi>I</hi> went out, <hi>I</hi> doe appeale to all that were then; if <hi>I</hi> ſerved not you with candor.</p>
            <p>Ill office <hi>I</hi> never did to either of the Houſes, but did ever wiſh the good of both.</p>
            <p>For that laſt unhappy day, <hi>I</hi> had my ſhare of griefe in it, and <hi>I</hi> hope there are ſome doe remember, no man within the wals of this Houſe did expreſſe more Symptomes of Sorrow then <hi>I</hi> did.</p>
            <p>After an adjournment for two or three dayes, it pleaſed his Majeſty to ſend for me, to let me know, hee could not ſo reſolve of things as he deſired, and therefore was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous there might be an adjournement for ſome few dayes more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> proteſt, <hi>I</hi> did not then diſcerne in his Majeſty, and <hi>I</hi> believe it was not in his thought, to think of the diſſolving of the Parliament, but was pleaſed to command me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his pleaſure to the Houſe for an adjournment for ſome few dayes, and forthwith upon the delivery of the meſuage, to come and wait upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96306:4"/>
He likewiſe commanded me, if queſtions were offered to be out, upon my Allegiance I ſhould dare to doe it.</p>
            <p>How much then did I in all humbleneſſe reaſon with his Majeſtie, is not for me here to ſpeake; only thus much let me ſay.</p>
            <p>I was no Authour of any councell in it, I was onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in receiving Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this, as any thing I now produce, or doe invente, or take up for mine owne excuſe, but what is knowne to divers, and ſome Honorable perſons in this Houſe to be moſt true.</p>
            <p>All that I will ſay for that, is humbly to beſeech you all to conſider, that if it had beene any mans cauſe as it was mine, betweene the diſpleaſure of a gracious King, and the ill opinion of an Honorable Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you lay altogether; lay my firſt actions and behaviour with the laſt, I ſhall ſubmit with your honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and favourable conſtructions.</p>
            <p>For the ſhipping buſineſſe, my opinion in that cauſe hath layne heavy upon me; and I ſhall cleerely and truely preſent unto you what every thing is, with this proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (that if in reckoning up mine owne opinion, what I was of, or what I delivered, any thing of it he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, or contrary to the opinion of this Houſe) that I am farre from juſtifying of it, but ſubmit that and all other my actions to your wiſedome and goodneſſe: <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> the firſt Writs that were ſent out about ſhipping buſineſſe, I had no more knowledge of it, and was as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as any one member of this Houſe, or any man in the Kingdome, I was never the Authour or deviſer of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will bouldly ſay, from the firſt houre, I did never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe or councell the ſetting forth of any ſhip Writs in my life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96306:4"/>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> it is true, that I was made chiefe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the common Pleas ſome foure dayes before the Ship-writs went out to the Ports and Maritine places (as I doe remember) the 13 of <hi>October,</hi> 1634, they doe beare teſt: And I was ſworne chiefe Juſtice the 16 of <hi>October,</hi> ſo as they went out in that time, but without my knowledge or privity, the God of Heaven knowes this to be true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Master Speaker,</hi> afterwards his Majeſty was pleaſed to command my Lord chiefe Juſtice of the Kings Bench, that then was (Sir <hi>Thomas Richardſon)</hi> and chiefe Baron of the Exchequer that now is, and my ſelfe, then chiefe of the Common Pleas, to take into conſideration the preſident then brought unto us, which we did, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returned to his Majeſty what we had found out of theſe Preſidents.</p>
            <p>It is true, that afterwards his Majeſty did take into conſideration, that if the whole Kingdome were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that it was not reaſon to lay the whole burthen upon the Cinque Ports and Maritine Townes.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, upon what ground his Majeſty tooke that into his conſideration, I do confeſſe I do know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty did command my Lord chiefe Juſtice that now is, my Lord chiefe Baron, and my ſelfe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne our opinions; whether, when the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is in danger, and the Kingdome ingenerall is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, it be not according to Law and reaſon, that the whole Kingdome, and his Majeſty and all intereſſed therein, ſhould joyne in defending and preſerving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>This was in time, about one 1634.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96306:5"/>
In Michaelmas Terme following, his Majeſty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to goe to all the Judges, and require their opinions in particular.</p>
            <p>He commanded me to doe it to every one, and to charge them upon their duty and allegiance, to keepe it ſecret.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> it was never intended by his Majeſty (ſo profeſſed by him) at that time, and ſo declared to all the Judges, that it was not required by him, to be ſuch a binding opinion to the Subject, as to hinder him from calling it in queſtion, nor to be binding to themſelves, but that upon better reaſon, and adviſe they may alter it; but deſired their opinions, for his owne private reaſon.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that extrajudiciall opinion of Judges ought not to be binding.</p>
            <p>But I did think, and ſpeake my heart and conſcience freely; my ſelfe, and the reſt of the Judges being ſworn and by our oaths tyed to Counſell the King when he ſhould require adviſe of us, that we were bound by our oaths and duties to returne our opinions.</p>
            <p>I did obey his Majeſties command, and doe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of heaven avow it.</p>
            <p>I did never uſe the leaſt promiſe of preferment or reward to any, nor did uſe the leaſt menacy; I did leave it freely to their owne conſciences and liberty; for I was left the liberty of my owne by his Majeſty, and had reaſon to leave them the liberty of their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech you be pleaſed to have ſome belief, that I would not ſay this, but that I know the God of heaven will make it appeare, and I beſeech you that extravagant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96306:5"/>
ſpeeches may not move againſt that which is a poſitive and cleere truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> in the diſcourſe of this (as is between Judges, ſome ſmall diſcourſes ſometimes) yet never any cauſe wherein any Judges conferred, that were ſo little conference as betweene me and them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> againſt a Negative, I can ſay nothing, but I ſhall affirme nothing unto you, but by the grace of God, as I affirme it to be true, ſo I make no doubt of making it appeare to be ſo.</p>
            <p>This opinion was ſubſcribed without Solicitation, there was not any man of us did make any doubt of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing our opinion, but two, Maſter Juſtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Maſter Juſtice <hi>Crooke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Maſter Juſtice <hi>Crooke</hi> made not a ſcruple of the thing, but of the introduction, for it was thus:</p>
            <p>That whereas the Ports and the Maritine Townes were concerned; there according to the Preſidents in former times, the charge lay on them.</p>
            <p>So when the Kingdome was in danger, of which his Majeſty was the ſole Judge; whether it was not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Law and reaſon, the whole Kingdome to beare the charge;</p>
            <p>I left this caſe with Judge <hi>Crooke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Terme I ſpake with him, he could give me no reſolution, becauſe he had not ſeene the writs in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, but did give his opinion, that when the whole Kingdome was in danger, they of the defence ought to be borne by all.</p>
            <p>So of that opinion of his, there was no need of a Solicitation.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake no more here, than I did openly in my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

in the Chequer Chamber.</p>
            <p>This is the naked truth: for Maſter Juſtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> he did never ſubſcribe at all.</p>
            <p>I will onely ſay this, that I was ſo far from preſſing him to give his opinion, becauſe he did aske time to conſider of it, that I will boldly ſay, and make it good; that when his Majeſty would have had him ſometimes ſent for, to give his opinion, I beſeeched his Majeſty to leave him to himſelfe and his conſcience; and that was the ill office I did.</p>
            <p>The Judges did ſubſcribe in <hi>November</hi> or <hi>December,</hi> 1635.</p>
            <p>I had no conference (nor truly I thinke) by accident any diſcourſe with any of the Judges touching their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; for till <hi>February</hi> 1636, there was no ſpeech of it, for when they had delivered their opinions, I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne (according to my duty) to my Maſter the King, and delivered them to him: in whoſe cuſtody they bee in.</p>
            <p>In <hi>February</hi> 1636, upon a command that came from his Majeſty, by one of the then Secretaries of State; the Judges all aſſembled in Grayes-Inne, we did then fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a debate of the caſe then ſent unto us, and we did then returne our opinion unto his Majeſty; there was then much diſcourſe and great debate about it.</p>
            <p>Mine opinion and conſcience at that time was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that opinion I then delivered.</p>
            <p>I did uſe the beſt arguments I could, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of my opinion; and that was all I did.</p>
            <p>It is true that then at that time, Maſter Juſtice <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and Maſter Juſtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> did not differ in the meane point, which was this;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:96306:6"/>
When the Kingdome was in danger, the chargd ought to be borne by the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But this point, whether the King was the ſole Judge of the danger? they differed.</p>
            <p>So as there was betweene the firſt ſubſcription, and this debate, and conſultation, ſome 15. monthes diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance?</p>
            <p>It is true, that all of them did then ſubſcribe, both Juſtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> which was returned to his Majeſty, and after publiſhed by my Lord Keeper (my predeceſſor) in the Stat-chamber.</p>
            <p>For the manner of publiſhing it I will ſay nothing, but leave it to thoſe, whoſe memories will call to mind what was then done.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the ſubſcription of Juſtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> (though they differed in opinion) grew from this that was told them from the reſt of the Judges.</p>
            <p>That where the greater number did agree in their vote, the reſt were involved and included.</p>
            <p>And now I have faithfully delivered, what I did in that buſineſſe, till I came (which was afterwards) to my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the Exchequer Chamber, for the queſtion was, <hi>Aſcire facias</hi> iſſued out of the Exchequer, in that caſe of Maſter <hi>Hampdens;</hi> of which I can ſay nothing, for it was there begun, and afterwards rejourned, to have advice of all the Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> among the reſt (according to my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) I argued the caſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you, to tell you what my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, I preſume their are Copies enough of it; only I will tell you there are foure things, very briefly,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96306:7"/>
what I then declared.</p>
            <p>Firſt concerning the matter of danger, and neceſſary of the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>I profeſſe that there was never a Judge in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did deliver an opinion, but that it muſt be in a caſe of apparant danger.</p>
            <p>When we came to an argument of the caſe, it was not upon a matter or iſſue, but it was upon a demurrer.</p>
            <p>Whether the danger was ſufficiently admitted in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and therefore was not the thing that was in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that was the firſt degree and ſtep that led unto it.</p>
            <p>I did deliver my ſelfe as free and as cleare as any man did, that the King ought to governe by the poſitive Lawes of the Kingdome, that he could not alter nor change, nor innovate in matters of Law, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent in Parliament.</p>
            <p>I did ſurther deliver, that if this were uſed to make a further revenue or benefit to the King, or in any other way but in caſe of neceſſity, and for the preſervation of the Kingdome, The judgement did warrant no ſuch thing:</p>
            <p>My opinion in this buſines, I did in my concluſion of my argument ſubmit to the judgement of this Houſe.</p>
            <p>I never delivered my opinion that mony ought to be raiſed, but Ships provided for the defence of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and in that the writ was performed.</p>
            <p>And that the charge ought not to be in any caſe, but where the whole Kingdome was in danger.</p>
            <p>And Maſter Juſtice <hi>Hutton,</hi> and Maſter Juſtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> were of the ſame opinion with me.</p>
            <p>I doe humbly ſubmit, having related unto you my whole carriage in this buſineſſe, humbly ſubmitting my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96306:7"/>
to your grave and favourable conſures, beſeeching you not to thinke that I delivered theſe things with the leaſt intention to ſubvert or ſubject the common Law of the Kingdome, or to bring in or to introduce any new way of government, it hath beene farre from my thoughts, as any thing under the heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> I have heard too that there hath bin ſome ill opinion conceived of me about Forreſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which was a thing far out of the way of my ſtudy, as any thing I know towards the Law.</p>
            <p>But it pleaſed his Majeſty, in the ſickneſſe of Maſter <hi>Noye,</hi> to give ſome ſhort warning to prepare my ſelfe for that imployment.</p>
            <p>When I came there, I did both the King and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth acceptable ſervice, for I did and dare be bold to ſay, with extreame danger to my ſelfe and fortune, (ſome doe underſtand my meaning here in) ran through that buſineſſe, and left the Forre<gap reason="illegible: smudged" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> as much as was there.</p>
            <p>A thing in my judgment conſiderable for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Common-wealth, as could be undertaken.</p>
            <p>When I went downe about that imployment, I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied my ſulfe about the matter of perambulation.</p>
            <p>There were great difficulty of opinions, what peram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation was.</p>
            <p>I did arme my ſulfe as well as I could, before I did any thing in it.</p>
            <p>I did acquaint thoſe that were then Judges, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the noble Lords, with ſuch objections as I thought it my duty to offer unto them.</p>
            <p>If they thought they were not objections of ſuch waight, as were not fit to ſtirre them, I would not doe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96306:8"/>
the King that diſſervice.</p>
            <p>They thought the objections had ſuch anſwers as might well induce the like upon a conference with the whole Country, admitting me to come and conferre to with them; the Country did unanimouſly ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>It fell out afterwards, that the King commanded me, and all this before <hi>I</hi> was chiefe Juſtice, togo into <hi>Eſsex,</hi> and did, then tell me he had beene enformed, that the bounds of the Forreſt were narrer, then in truth ought they to be; and <hi>I</hi> did according to his command.</p>
            <p>I will here profeſſe that which is knowne to many, I had no thought or intention of enlarging the bounds of the Forreſt, further then that part about it, which there was a perambulation about 26 <hi>Edward</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>I deſired the Country to confer with me about it, if they were pleaſed to doe it; and then according to my duty, I did produce theſe Records which I thought fit for his Majeſties ſervice, knowing them to diſcharge themſelves as by Law and Juſtice they might doe.</p>
            <p>I did never in the leaſt kind, goe about to overthrow the charter of the Foreſt.</p>
            <p>And did publiſh and maintaine <hi>Charta de Foreſt<gap reason="illegible: smudged" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> as a ſacred thing and no man to violate it, and ought to be preſerved for the King and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>I doe in this humbly ſubmit, and what I have done, to the goodneſſe and Juſtice of this Houſe.</p>
