            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Preface rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the life of
St. Dunſtan, the
Author.</head>
            <p>HOw reverent an
eſteem Antiquity
hath had of this holy man
wil appear, in that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
famous Authors have
written concerning him,
to wit the Author of the
<hi>Brittiſh</hi> Antiquities; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Great Brittain;
Malmsbury,</hi> and <hi>Mat.
<pb facs="tcp:46947:3"/>
Weſtminſter.</hi> He lived
about the year of our Lord
946. having been at firſt
a Monk, after that Abbot
of <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> then
Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
next of <hi>London,</hi> and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury:</hi>
As to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
part of his life, it
was ſo exemplary, that
after ages even to this
time have eſteemed it mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous:
He flouriſhed in
the Reigns of <hi>Edred</hi> or
<hi>Eldred, Edwin</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
three Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46947:3"/>
In <hi>Edwins</hi> Reign
he was Baniſhed, during
which time the King by
the Rebellion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
was deprived both
of his life and Kingdom,
whom <hi>Edgar</hi> ſucceeding,
highly favoured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted.
He Crown'd <hi>Edw.</hi>
King at Kingſton, this
<hi>Edward</hi> was ſurnamed
the Martyr, being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Queen <hi>Elfrida.</hi>
After whoſe death <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
was Crowned King
by <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> with whom
<pb facs="tcp:46947:4"/>
alſo he was ſo much in
favour that he preferred
him before all his Nobles
and laid up all his richeſt
royal Houſholdſtuff, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Records with all
his Wealth and Treaſure
in his Monaſtery, ſo that
all things were in his
power, the King without
his advice doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
either in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or in his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
negotiations: And
as he ſtood thus in his
Royal Maſters favour,
<pb facs="tcp:46947:4"/>
with all fidelity to that
great eſteem he employed
his endeavours to enrich
religious places either by
the <hi>Danes</hi> waſted; or by
bimſelf founded: in this
manner did our Author by
the favour of his Prince
attain the higheſt honors,
and ſurely not without
great merit, his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
acquired parts
and learning, deſerving
greater Eulogyes then
this narrow ſcantling of
Paper can allow room for.
At laſt full of honour and
<pb facs="tcp:46947:5"/>
dayes and replete with
the grace and affection of
his Prince, be received
his <hi>Quietus eſt</hi> from the
cares of this world to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

better, leaving behind
him the pattern of his
Religion, vertue and
learning for the world to
imitate, a taſt whereof

an ingenious peice of curious
Art which may well be entituled
<hi>An exact Piece of Philoſophy,</hi>
for its ſubject is of ſuch a nature as

and that hath made
ſome even pretenders to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cry out, That the Philoſophers
Stone is indeed an invaluable
Gemme, but ſuch as deſerves only
to paſs among nominal, not real
Jewels, but it would be a toylſom
work, and to as little purpoſe as
<hi>certare de lana caprina,</hi> to give
an anſwer to ſuch Anomalus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichio's.</p>
            <p>The following tract (there is
no doubt) will yeild great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to all ſuch as knowingly
<pb facs="tcp:46947:6"/>
purſue this kind of Philoſophy,
eſpecially when they ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

for it bears in front the Reverend
Character of Learned <hi>Dunſtan,</hi>
of whom the preſent world, at

know, that he was as exact as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent,
and ſo diligent, that none
before, nor hardly any ſince did
ever arrive herein to equal perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with him.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould we waſte time

               <head>Touching the Stone of
Phyloſophers.</head>
               <p>IT is chiefly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Phyloſophers did
often endeavour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in a moſt ſhort time
above the Earth, thoſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46947:7"/>
things, which by Nature,
in many years, were perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the Earth; <hi>viz.</hi>
To make moſt perfect and
moſt pretious <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune;</hi>
wherein they imitated the
foreſteps of Nature, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to themſelves moſt pure
Earths, white and Red,
which they named their <hi>Sol</hi>
and <hi>Lune;</hi> joyning them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as Nature doth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repugnance, untill at
length they were brought
to a fixation and ſubtilty:
This thing alſo is needfull
for you to perform, if you
deſire to obtain the deſired
end in this Science.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but <hi>Red</hi> and
<hi>White</hi> Earth, to which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46947:7"/>
hath perfectly joyned
<hi>Argent vive,</hi> pure, ſubtile,
white, and Red, and ſo of
them hath produced <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore needfull
for thee, ſeeking this <hi>Science,</hi>
That firſt thou get theſe
Earths, White and Red,
ſubtile, pure and fixed, and
in theſe two Earths to fix
two <hi>Mercuries,</hi> white in the
white, and red in the red,
without diviſion, and by
their leaſt parts, ſo as they
may endure the greateſt
<hi>examen</hi> of the fire, and may
have ſuch fuſion, that as we
ſee a great quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
coloured with a little
Saffron, ſo they may in the
leaſt quantity abundantly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46947:8"/>
tinge every mettall, and all
metalline ſpirits whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
ſo as they be of the
ſame Kind and Nature, and
may altogether and fully
bring them to their own
quality.</p>
               <p>And moreover, that in
themſelves they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
multiplied, and able
to free the body of Man
from the worſt and moſt
deadly Diſeaſes; which
Properties truly are not
found in common <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune,</hi> without great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
(and yet but onely in
part) becauſe that the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative
power, the Mother
of all increaſe, for the moſt
part, is long ſince extinct in
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:46947:8"/>
If thou know how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this, and to imitate the
condition of the inferiour
nature in making Mettals,
thou mayſt worthily rejoyce
in the name of a Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
as being not meanly
expert in natural things.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, That the
more Antient Phyloſophers
uſed not common <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune</hi> in this Work, and
therefore they ſaid, That
their work needed not great
Coſt and Charges, but that
it might be as well perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Poor, as the Rich:
Which were altogether
different from the truth, if
it could not be performed
without Common <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune:</hi> For they are very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46947:9"/>
pretious and rare, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be gotten of poor men
without great labour. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
many have brought
great quantities of <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune</hi> to nothing by this Art,
and have unprofitably ſpent
and waſted their Time and
Labour, to the deſtruction
both of their Bodies and
Souls, which is much to be
lamented.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in theſe our
Times, we know no man
who doth diligently and
truly find out the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Tinctures, but moſt of
them labour abſurdly and
vainly in vulgar <hi>Mercury,</hi> and
in common <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune;</hi>
therefore few of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:46947:9"/>
Let us take heed; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi> may be
ſubtilated and mixed with
tinctures, and ſo reduced
into leſſer tinctures and
Elixers with mean profit;
yet the true way according
to the Doctrine of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
is not in them: for
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi> are two tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
Principal, red and
white, buried in one and the
ſame body, which by nature
were never brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
compliment, yet they
are ſeparable from their dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and earthy accidentall
droſs, and afterward accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their proper qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
are made moſt fit fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for pure earth, white
and red, ſo as in no ſort
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46947:10"/>
they are ſaid to need any
other thing.</p>
               <p>For the whole Work is
one, and the thing it ſelf is
one, and all the whole is
derived from an Image. For
our Anceſtors knew, that
the parts of this our Stone
are celeſtiall and concrete;
which were altogether ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
if common <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune</hi> were needfull to the
compoſition thereof.</p>
               <p>For it is ſaid, Take a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
wherein is <hi>Argent vive,</hi>
pure, clean, unſpotted, and
incompleat of Nature: ſuch
a body after its compleat
and perfect cleanſing, is
much better then the Bodies
of Mineral <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this ſelf-ſame body,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46947:10"/>
which is the matter of the
Stone, three things are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid; namely, that it is
a green Lyon, a ſtinking
Gumme, and a white Fume.</p>
               <p>But this is ſpoken of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,
purpoſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Folks, and to bring
them into doubts, by the
many and different names.</p>
               <p>But underſtand thou ſhalt,
one thing alwaies is really
ſignified, though acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
and by names it is ſaid
to be three: for the <hi>green
Lyon, ſtinking Liquor,</hi> and
<hi>white Fume,</hi> are ſpoken of
one and the ſame ſubject,
wherein they altogether lie
hid, untill by Art they are
made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:46947:11"/>
By the <hi>green Lion,</hi> all
Philoſophers mean <hi>green Sol</hi>
multipliable and ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
which is as yet incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
by Nature, having
power to reduce Bodies to
the firſt matter, and to make
fixed things ſpirituall and
flying, and ſo it is fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Lion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as every Beaſt is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Lion, ſo every
Metalline body is confirmed
and ſtrengthened by the
power of this Liony and
green <hi>Sol;</hi> namely, of our
<hi>Mercury,</hi> when it is Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophically
prepared.</p>
               <p>This is bred and born
with a certain water, which
we call <hi>Argent vive</hi> of the
Philoſophers, and white
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46947:11"/>
                  <hi>Mercury:</hi> Therefore their
water White and Red, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
unto us two tinctures,
white and red, proceeding
from one body and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
Theſe are alwaies
named our <hi>Mercuries;</hi> and
after due conjunction, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
and digeſtion, we
call our White and Red
Stones.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>ſtinking gumme,</hi>
we mean a certain ſtinking
ſmell, proceeding from the
unclean Body in the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation,
which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like unto ſtinking <hi>Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faetida,</hi>
that with a certain
ſweetneſs, whereof it is ſaid
before its preparation, its
ſmell is grievous; which is
moſt certain: but after that,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46947:12"/>
in a due manner it ſhall be
prepared and circulated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any quinteſſence.</p>
               <p>This dignified matter of
Philoſophers abounds with
unſpeakable ſweetneſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
power to cure the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,
and other grievous
Diſeaſes; and without this
our living <hi>Sol,</hi> it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make <hi>aurum potabile,</hi>
to cure with; which of
Philoſophers is called the
<hi>Elixer</hi> of Life, and of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
               <p>Yet I deny not, but that
Philoſophers may very well
and with good ſucceſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
Mineral <hi>Lune</hi> and <hi>Sol</hi>
with radical things of their
own kind, and as yet not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by Nature, and ſo may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46947:12"/>
attain to the higheſt myſterie
of this Art.</p>
               <p>But certainly it is not for
every mean Wit; it is for
<hi>Princes</hi> who do moſt abound
with <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune:</hi> but this
way is univerſally open and
lawfull unto all men, yet
chiefly for poor men, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more brief, and of leſſe
Coſt.</p>
               <p>It is called a <hi>white Fume,</hi>
becauſe that in the firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation,
before the red
tincture doth aſcend, there
riſeth a fume truly white,
whereby the receiver is
clouded with a frequent
milkiſh ſhadow and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
for which cauſe it is
called the Virgins Milk.
Wherefore, whereſoever
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46947:13"/>
thou ſhalt find a ſubſtance
endued with theſe three
qualities, know that it is the
true matter of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Stone.</p>
               <p>There ariſeth a Queſtion
very difficult, which much
troubleth fantaſtick Heads,
<hi>viz.</hi> our Stone ſheweth it
ſelf in a foul ſhape, becauſe
it is in every thing, and in
every place; whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men reading this, make
choice of ſeveral and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things, which with great
labour they diſtil, calcine, &amp;
joyn together. But let ſuch
hear what the Philoſophers
ſay, <hi>Who ſo ſeeks the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
Secrets in Turds looſeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his
Labour, and in the end
finds nothing but deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46947:13"/>
Yet there is alſo another
thing which troubleth theſe
mens Brains, <hi>viz.</hi> our
Stone is bred between two
Mountains, it is caſt out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Dunghill, and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
under mens feet, it is
counted a moſt vile and
contemptible thing, it is
generated between Male
and Female, and lieth hide
in Thee, in Me, and in ſuch
like things. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is ſaid, Our Stone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be in things differing
from its kind, namely, from
the Nature of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune;</hi>
for nothing can give that
which it hath not. A Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
cannot produce a Roſe,
nor a Woman a Dog; How
then ſhall we reſolve ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46947:14"/>
many doubts riſing from
Contrarieties?</p>
               <p>Truly, it is eaſily done;
for it is plain, That nothing
in this World, whether it
be Animal, Vegetable, or
Mineral, can be generated
without a natural and a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
appetite.</p>
               <p>Therefore according to
the Doctrine of Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
which informs us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by obſcure Examples;
We muſt underſtand that
the Stone may be by Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in every thing, and in all
places, chiefly, becauſe it is
nothing elſe but a ſpecifical
vertue and quality joyned
with natural heat, whereby
every compounded thing is
brought to his perfecteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:46947:14"/>
Things generally ſpoken
are alwaies generally to be
underſtood, for what earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing can be in every
thing, and in all places, but
only a ſpecifical Appetite,
and a natural Heat; for
theſe are the immediate and
near cauſes without which
the Stone cannot be.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever therefore
deſireth to underſtand the
Stone, let him not depart
from his ſpecifical quality
and Original.</p>
               <p>Of a Man cometh a Man,
of a Roſe a Roſe; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
from a matter which is
potentially Gold, having
things neceſſary, and Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
purged, ariſeth <hi>Sol</hi> by
an inward Appetite; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46947:15"/>
from a Mettal ariſeth a
multitude of metalline tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
and perfection: The
Stone is made of a mettal,
living, hot and moiſt, when
natural heat is joyned with
it, whereby it is made apt
to generate its like. For
our Stone is moſt pure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>viz.</hi> the nature of <hi>Sol,</hi>
containing in it ſelf a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
heat, whereby it hath
power and vertue alwaies to
multiply in its own ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and natural form; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called the ſecret
Fire of nature, ſtirring up
the compound, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
it in our Glaſſe into a
Stone, in like manner as ſeed,
by reaſon of its own proper
naturall heat, and radicall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46947:15"/>
moiſture, if its mother
Earth doth putrifie to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Generation and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever therefore
keeps not this our heat, our
fire, our balnium, our invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
and moſt temperate
flame, and of one regiment,
and continually burning in
one quality and meaſure
within our Glaſſe; I ſay,
whoſoever underſtands not
this Dunghill, horſebelly,
and moiſt fire, ſhall labour
in vain, and ſhall never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this Science.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt therefore that
the radical humidity, which
is that firſt vegetable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
is the cauſe of multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of every thing in its
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46947:16"/>
kind. Therefore of the
Compoſition of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune</hi>
take our burning water, that
<hi>Aqua vite,</hi> which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
do think, but falſly, to
be extracted from Wine,
Oyl, and ſuch like Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
               <p>I ſay, ſuch green <hi>Sol</hi> and
<hi>Lune,</hi> in which the vegetable
vertue is not extinguiſhed,
but is living, hot and moiſt,
and hath power to reduce all
Bodies to their vegetability;
for by this, with Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
bodies extinct, and
not multipliable, may more
eaſily get the habit and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to germinate, which of
Phyloſophers is called the
beginning and tearm from
whence the Stone is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46947:16"/>
                  <hi>Marie</hi> the Propheteſſe in
an Epiſtle to <hi>Aron,</hi> writeth,
<hi>That the Body taken from
little Mountains, is a Body
white and clear, not ſuffering
putrefaction nor motion, and
it is that which is generated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Male and Female;</hi> By
thoſe little Mountains is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> which
are naturally ſeparated from
us by a great diſtance, by
whoſe influence Gold and
Silver are generated, both
which are in our Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>By Male and Female, we
underſtand Agent and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
Active and Paſſive, both
which are alſo in our active
Mercury, and in our Paſſive
Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:46947:17"/>
Whereby, without
doubt, is inferred, that a
mineral Earth and Water
are the Active and Paſſive
matter, as the Philoſophers
Stone. And here hence
appears that community be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Poor and Rich;
ſeeing that the Stone may be
made of one thing, without
viſible <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here by the way, I
advertiſe thee, that betwixt
the Elixer and the Stone
there is this difference; for
the Stone rejoyceth in unity
and ſimplicity, but the Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in plurality.</p>
               <p>The Stone therefore is
one thing, our <hi>Mercury, Sol,
Lune,</hi> our Lincture white
and red, which may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46947:17"/>
joyned with its own
proper Earth, or with the
Earth taken from the little
Mountains, and may eaſily
be obtained by mortal men.
But the Elixer is the ſame
vegetable <hi>Mercury,</hi> which
yet by reaſon of its fixation,
is ſaid not to be common,
but conſiſting of many
things, for it is abſolutely
fix'd in the Earth of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune:</hi> And
therefore it alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
of many things, <hi>viz.</hi>
of <hi>Mercury</hi> vegetable, and
of a different Earth, which
is neither Common nor fit
for poor men. But of this
Earth, it is not much to be
reſpected of what ſubſtance
it is, ſo it be fix'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:46947:18"/>
                  <hi>Alphidius</hi> is of the ſame
Opinion, ſaying, <hi>The Faeces,
from whence this Earth is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
ſeeing it is of no value,
is altogether to be rejected,
and the</hi> Mercury <hi>to be planted
in another ſubtil Earth:</hi> For
its own Earth is ſeldom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
in the compoſition of
the Elixer.</p>
               <p>Yet, my Friend, I will
name it to thee by its own
Name, whereby the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People name it; and it
is the end of the Egg, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Mettals, <hi>viz. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
rightly mix'd by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with its own ſulphur,
of its own accord inclined by
pntrefaction and growing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:46947:18"/>
From this Egg, three
things muſt be conſidered;
namely, The Yolk, the
White, and the Shell; and
this laſt is only and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſary for Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
which is called the
end of the Egg; that is, the
laſt part, rejoycing in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
having the likeneſs
of a little Mountain, and
alſo generated between
Male and Female; which
when it is perfectly calcined
it exceeds all Earths what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
in whiteneſs and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
enduring the greateſt
fire, embracing Tincture,
and deſiring a metal in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
of Workers in the
Art, unleſs they being
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46947:19"/>
overcome by experience the
Miſtreſs of things, that they
be compelled to confeſs and
admire it. But another
Earth, wherein there is
any Mercurial humidity,
will not drink up our <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
with ſo much greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and therefore it is
not ſo commodious; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, becauſe it aboundeth
with its proper and natural
humidity, but this hath non
ſuch, for its humidity was
naturally transferred to the
generation and union of the
White and the Yolk.</p>
               <p>Yet we deny not, that this
vertue is neceſſary, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the preſervation
of man's Body, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the outward
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46947:19"/>
parts to the inward, yet ſo
as it be mixed with the Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of life; this Earth is
wholly contemned, when
the matter included is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and is caſt out on
the Dunghill, and every
where troden under foot,
and accounted unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I deſiring to
try whether it would joyn
with our unctious humidity:
I put it thereto, which it
drunk up with ſo great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
as that it ſeemed
ſpongious, &amp; a moſt fat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealation,
rather then an
Earth naturally naked;
from which when I had
gently evoparated <hi>Mercury,</hi>
it remained very Citron.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:46947:20"/>

between the Body and

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46947:23"/>
then the Body ſhall dye of

and putting on many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
after the third Day,

and when his Journey is

And thus thou may'ſt wait
again patiently the Harveſt,
and thou ſhould be fill'd

now we will ſpeak of Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Take an ounce of this
Calx hidden before in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46947:24"/>
Philoſophers eg, and thereon
put of the red tincture to
cover it two fingers; then
ſeal it, and ſet it to putrifie
eight daies in a moſt cold
place; which being ended,
it will drink up the humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
again pour on as much
of the tincture, and let it
ſtand as before for other
eight daies, continuing again
the ſaid imbibitions and
times: let it ſtand till it ceaſe
to drink any more tincture;
remove it not from its place,
untill it be blacker then any
pitch; which being ſeen,
ſet it into a natural balmy,
that the moiſture with the
black Earth may be digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and fixed into a white
Mineral: then divide it into
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46947:24"/>
two equal parts, and work
the one for the white, and
the other for the red ſtone:
which thou ſhalt thus eaſily
perform; Ferment the one
part with the oyl of <hi>Lune,</hi>
that is, with white water,
and the other part with the
oyl of <hi>Sol,</hi> that is, with the
red water; and ſo by greater
heat and digeſtion, it ſhall
be converted into a moſt red
powder, like Dragons blood.</p>
               <p>This powder being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a part of our <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and circulated, is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> Elixer
of life and of Mettalls, which
tranſmuteth <hi>Mercury</hi> and all
imperfect mettals into moſt
perfect <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:46947:25"/>
But here learn a general
Rule; If thou ordain the
Elixer only for the white,
then keep one part of the
red work, diſtill the other
part with a gentle fire, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the white water, which
we call our white tincture,
our Eagle, our white <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
and Virgins milk, and
having theſe two <hi>Mercuries,</hi>
thou mayſt practiſe with
them, either upon their own
Earths, or upon the calxes of
Mettals prepared.</p>
               <p>For it is ſaid, The Earth
is not much to be reſpected,
ſo that it be fix'd. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take which thou wilt,
being firſt altered into
whiteneſs; and for the white
work, you may ferment thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:46947:25"/>
Take the Calx of <hi>Lune</hi>
and Earth altered, equall
parts, grind them together,
and temper them with white
<hi>Mercury,</hi> named Virgins
milk, which keep ſafe; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
the reſt not fixed, and
that which ariſeth to the
ſides of the glaſs, like <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
ſublimed, reiterate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his proper calxes, grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and tempering with our
Virgins milk, diſtilling and
ſubliming as before, untill no
fire will raiſe it.</p>
               <p>This our <hi>Mercury</hi> ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and fixed, made of the
white Earth of bodies alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ariſing at firſt admirably
by the vertue and help of
water.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:46947:26"/>
This is that <hi>Mercury,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of which the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
take the compounded of
common <hi>Mercury, Vitriol,</hi> and
<hi>Sol</hi> ſublimed; wherein they
are deceived: when this is
thus fixed into white earth,
it is afterward calcined,
whereof is made an Elixer
or ſtone as followeth; Put
it into a circulatorie, and
pour thereon Virgins milk
to cover it, then circulate
it to the thickneſs of oyl, by
drying and calcining it, as
often as thou wilt, for by
this means it may be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
infinitely.</p>
               <p>But before thou make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
congeal it into an
oily powder, one part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
converts thouſand, nay
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46947:26"/>
ten thouſand parts of <hi>Argent
vive,</hi> and the other Mettals
into pure <hi>Lune,</hi> enduring all
trialls.</p>
               <p>In like manner thou ſhalt
work with the Red Water
upon the calx of Metals, by
fermenting and ſubliming
upon the calx of <hi>Sol</hi> alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And note, That thou canſt
have no perfect ferment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it be altered with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
from their firſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
into a new whiteneſſe
and redneſſe by means of
Putrifaction and alteration,
which before it wanted.</p>
               <p>But when after putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
it ſhall be reduced
into Whiteneſs, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſpiritual, and is more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46947:27"/>
apt to joyn better with our
<hi>Mercurie</hi> ſublimed natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by the leaſt parts,
and alſo to be fixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſeparably; which
would not be ſo naturall, if
one part were fixed, and the
other part to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Moreover, when ſpirits
have not vertue to penetrate
bodies, nor bodies appetite
to imbrace ſpirits, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
that they ſhould be
joyned by their leaſt parts.</p>
               <p>But contrarily, when fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are made ſpirituall,
then ſpirits will joyn with
ſpirits, and the body which
was moſt perfectly fix'd, is
naturally diſpoſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to return to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

            <p>GOD is wonderfull in

Vertue, teaching the

            <p>Take in this name the

            <p>By the ſame way of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifaction,
all Mineralls may
be altered, and ſo of every
fixed thing (a due matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Elixer,</hi> for our <hi>Mercury</hi> white
and red muſt be joyned with
fixed things which want
<hi>Mercury;</hi> and this way the
Metalline Bodies may be
brought into a metalline
form, namely a Vitrified
Powder, as alſo Egg-ſhells,
which when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
calcined, will endure
fire more than <hi>Sol;</hi> and
thereof being well and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
ting'd, Philoſaphers
have made <hi>Sol</hi> in the ſpace
of one day, which Nature
cannot do under-ground in a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46947:38"/>
thouſand years: A thing
hard and incredible to the
unlearned; yet true and
moſt certain, and confirmed
by the Teſtimony of many
men.</p>
            <p>Be thou therefore not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
or curious in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thine Earth, ſo that it be
of a Metalline Nature, and
induring the Fire.</p>
            <p>Hereby Glaſs is made
malleable, and by meanes of
this Tincture, is converted
into tranſparent and fixed
Mettal, whereby it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that this Science is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>For there is no Earth
which doth more eaſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Spirituality of our
<hi>Mercury,</hi> than that which is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46947:38"/>
moſt deprived of <hi>Mercury,</hi>
and moiſture; which Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thou ſhalt not find in
Bodies of another Nature,
although yet they be very
much calcined.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it appeareth
manifeſtly, that ſeeing <hi>Sol</hi>
and <hi>Lune,</hi> are nothing elſe
but Earth, Red and White,
wherein a moſt pure <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
is fixed and joyned by
the leaſt parts, that <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
(having the ſame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
may artificially imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Nature in her Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
under the Earth, to
produce the ſame effect: for
it is certain, that Earth may
be fermented to Water, ſo
as it be fixed; and Water
fermented to Earth, if it be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46947:39"/>
perfect and cleanſed; and
this without the help of any
common <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Lune:</hi> And
therefore <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in their
Writings have taught, that
the Stone is equally common
both to the Poor and Rich.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered,
thou ſhalt underſtand, that
our Stone lyeth hidden, and
fecretly lurketh, often in
places leaſt ſuſpected, and
nothing eſteemed, whoſe
matter and nearneſs, if it
ſhould be known, would
produce moſt great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>It is to be noted, that the
<hi>Philoſophers</hi> have found out
divers wayes of handling
this one thing: But I anſwer
for them all, and briefly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46947:39"/>
conclude, That our Earth
doth drink up and fix our
<hi>Mercury;</hi> and that this <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
doth waſh and ting our
Earth, and ſo doth perfect it
into the Stone, without any
further ferment.</p>
            <p>For the white <hi>Mercury</hi>
giveth a moſt perfect Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of <hi>Lune,</hi> and the Red
<hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Sol:</hi> Therefore,
when they are fixed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Earths, they make
<hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> without the
help of common Gold and
Silver. Behold thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt
this Tincture,
which we draw out from a
vile thing of no price: yet
note, that he that hath Salt
in his Breaſt, may ferment
this Tincture with common
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46947:40"/>
Gold, whereby he may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
incomparable Riches,
yet with Wiſdom, with
moſt great Coſt, and not
without danger.</p>
            <p>For from <hi>Sol</hi> alone, by
means of this Tincture,
which is our burning Wine,
is made a moſt pretious and
a moſt perfect Elixer, white
and red; for it rejoyceth in
fulneſs of white and red Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
whereby may be made
moſt perfect Silver.</p>
            <p>Of this Work, I have
written more fully in my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Book; wherein I
Treat of the manifold plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Gold, and of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Elixer of Life: But here
alſo I will briefly touch it.
Underſtand therefore, that it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46947:40"/>
behoveth thee to alter the
Calx of Gold (with the
foreſaid Stone, equally mix'd
with the Water of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
ſublimed and perfectly
fixed) into moſt white and
fixed Sulpher.</p>
            <p>Then calcine it well, that
the ſtrength and poyſon of
the Fire againſt Nature put
to it, do haſten to Putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and alteration, may be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Then imbibe it with the
foreſaid ſimple Milk, untill
the Calx it ſelf have drunk
up a reaſonable quantity
thereof, and that it be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Diſſolve it again with the
ſame Milk, and make it vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile;
afterwards fix and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46947:41"/>
and then bring it into
Oyl, with a little part of that
Virgins Milk by circulation,
and ſo it ſhall be a perfect
Elixer, converting <hi>Mercury,</hi>
and each imperfect Mettal,
into moſt perfect <hi>Lune:</hi> and
by the ſame way, thou mayſt
rubifie the other part with
our Red <hi>Mercury,</hi> by fixing
and calcining, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſſolving it with the
ſame Red Menſtruum; and
at laſt by circulating it into
a thick Oyl, which we call
potable Gold, a curing and
preſerving Exixer of Life,
and of Metals.</p>
            <p>Know alſo, That if our
Red <hi>Mercury</hi> equally with
<hi>Mercury</hi> ſublimed and fixed,
be circulated with Lutrie,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46947:41"/>
Vitriol, or Iron, before and
after Rubification, be digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Oyl, it will convert
thine Lamins, of <hi>Lune</hi> neal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and injected into pure
<hi>Sol,</hi> which if thou afterward
taketh out, it will ſerve for
all need to live withall.</p>
            <p>It is a general Rule, That
if thou wilt be a Maſter of
this Art, it is needful to
make all Medicines gumous
and fuſible, melting like wax
of their own accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Fume, upon a Plate
nealed.</p>
            <p>For by this means, each
part will follow the other in
Projection and will joyntly
dilate themſelves through
the Pores of the Metal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any disjunction: but if
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46947:42"/>
any part be ponderous, it
will ſeparate the parts of
the Metal, &amp; make it brittle.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Medicine
muſt be often ſubtilated, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that it is perfectly fixed,
that at leaſt it may be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combuſtible
Oyl, and rather
may be called a <hi>Species,</hi> then a
<hi>Genus,</hi> becauſe it is nothing
elſe but a fixed Tincture of
Colour.</p>
            <p>If (this thing obſerved)
thou canſt prepare thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
thus, thou ſhalt make
fair Metals, and malleable,
or elſe not.</p>
            <p>Alſo here underſtand, two
Bodies to be diſſolved with
the Natural Menſtruum, is
always the ſecond Calx, not
the firſt; and therefore it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46947:42"/>
behoveth thee to diſſolve
Calx of Mettals with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<hi>Mercury,</hi> as before is
taught, that they may ſooner
putrifie, and be altered into
the ſecond Calx (which we
call <hi>Sulpher of Nature,</hi> and
<hi>Foliated Earth</hi>) which we
then diſſolve and circulate
into Oyl, with a Simple
Menſtruum; namely, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
