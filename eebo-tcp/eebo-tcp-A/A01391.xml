            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Make no question, but that true and wel written Discourse of the <hi>Anatomie of the English Nunnery at</hi> Lisbone <hi>in</hi> Portugall, hath not onely had a gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with you, but vvrought vpon your iudgements and vnderstanding, as farre as the abhorring their impieties, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the seduction of silly Ignorants, vvho, I dare affirme, being brought out into the sunnie splendour of Truth and Discouerie, would either vvonder, where and how they haue been so long detained in darknesse, or make sport at such ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb facs="tcp:17747:5"/>
absurdities, as they haue beene befooled withall.</p>
            <p>But because there remaines much more to be spoken out of other Relations, and vndeniable Verity, to make the pride of <hi>Babel</hi> loathsome to true <hi>Christian</hi> soules, and the impieties of that Man of sinne abhorred of all iudicious and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding men: I haue heere vnder-taken fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther searches for the good of all true-hearted Protestants indeed. And although I haue no such portion allotted, as with the Prophets Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and Candle to search the vnswept corners of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> or with Christs rodde of cords to whip the buyers and sellers out of the Temple: yet I hope I shall haue strength enough to wrastle downe the Strumpet, and lay her flat on her back to the hissing of the passengers.</p>
            <p>For all the painting of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and adorning of her head to seeme more maiesticall to <hi>Iehu:</hi> she was yet at the last thrown out of the window, and dashed against the ground: so shall <hi>Babylon</hi> that great Citie beserued, in the end shee shall be set on fire, and the Merchants of the earth shall howle at her desolation, amazed afarre off at her falling to rubbish, and beholding her smoake to ascend, like the smoake of a furnace: vvherein that you may see the reason of Gods indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whereby you may intertaine certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues for your owne conuersion, or establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I haue heere taken vpon me to discouer, how the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergie left and forsooke the
<pb facs="tcp:17747:5"/>
pure waters of <hi>Siloa,</hi> to drinke the puddled streames of Traditions and filthinesse, scorned to quench their thirst, and buy milke and food without money, but would needs vvith <hi>Simon Magus</hi> pay deare for spirituall gifts: and in a word, denied to come to wisedomes Feast, because they would runne a whoring after their owne inuentions, and feed their sensuall carkases with the banquet and acates of their owne desires, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising.</p>
            <p>At first I determined no method, or diuision, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that the spredding of instances &amp; examples would haue afforded sufficient contentment to the Reader for the subiect in hand, which is the detection of sundry foule abuses in Popery, or if you will, in the liues of Priests and Friers: but finding the streame to come downe with a maine current, and that the stopping or damming it vp too close, would ouer-flow the fields, and spoile much good ground. I thought it better to cut out certaine riuolets, and passages, wherein the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer might runne betweene bounded Bankes, and so the lookers on receiue both pleasure and profit in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some keeping their channels. For which purpose if you runne about the streame, you shall finde out certaine deceitfull Nookes, Holes, Creekes, and dangerous Flats or Shelues. First, of lying Miracles: Secondly, coozening Deuices. Thirdly, Whoredome. Fourthly, Epicurisme. Fiftly, Thefts and Robberies. Sixtly, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Seuenthly, Blasphemies. Eighthly, grosse Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Ninthly, Beastlines. Tenthly, Fooleries &amp; Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. Eleuenthly, Impieties: and 12. Simony. Of all which in order, or as orderly as I can, not that I place

them in their seates of precedencie, or tye them to any coherence of depending one vpon another; but to shew you with what palpable grosenesse they proceeded to ouerthrow True Religion, and iustified themselues in the world, to countenance their wickednesse, though they were neuer so foule delinquents.</p>
            <p>I leaue to dispute of their Doctrines, Schoole-que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, fundamentall Controuersies, Church-Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacie, and many other tedious disceptations, which haue clogged vs with heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and filled Libraries with thousands of Volumes, and onely at this time with <hi>Elias</hi> gather vp my cloathes for a cursorie iourney, and take my staffe in my hand, to goe the more speedier forward, and as I confesse, I must passe ouer much ground vnseene, and vnmarked: So I beseech you (gentle Reader) censure mee in the same manner, and excuse my not fully satisfying of you, by reason of the hastinesse of my iourney, and the small time I allot my selfe for the dispatch of my businesse: onely herein I dare be confident, there is not a step I make, but I haue warrant for my footing; nor Story I relate, but is extracted out of the bookes of their owne <hi>Magazines,</hi> and Authoritie of their former Writers.

            <p>These are the lying Miracles of Popish Prelates, which I haue recited, because they are not common, nor, as I take it, incerted in their <hi>Legend,</hi> but alledged by substantiall Authors, to countenance the Religion:
<pb facs="tcp:17747:8"/>
but for these, and the whole <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the rest in their notorious fables, you shall finde, that one of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances of <hi>Germany,</hi> when the Emperour condiscended to the reformation of Religion, was, that the Friers se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them with lyes, and wrought vpon the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of ignorant men, and superstitious women.</p>
            <p>Concerning coozening deuices; Are not yet men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, <note place="margin">Coozening deuices.</note> that can remember the knauerie of Priests to make the Roodes and Images of the Churches in <hi>England</hi> in the dayes of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> to goggle with their eyes, and shake their hands: yea, with Wiers to bend the whole body, and many times to speake as they doe in Puppet playes, and all to get money, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ignorant people?</p>
            <p>Was not a Priest punished in the latter end of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. for pricking his finger, and be-bleeding the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poras,</hi> making the people beleeue the Host had done it, &amp; that there was a very child seen in the singing cake?</p>
            <p>Were not all our tales of <hi>Fairies, Goblins, Robingood-fellow, walking Spirits,</hi> the knaueries of <hi>Priers</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> who for belly-cheere, and wanton Wenches, came to houses by night, and swept the roomes, yea, gossiped with the crafty lasciuious houswiues?</p>
            <p>Is not the tale of Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> worth the reciting, that comming into a Church to performe his deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, perceiued how knauishly the Priests had dealt with the Image of our <hi>Lady,</hi> to bid him good morrow, <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard?</hi> whereupon to exprobrate their folly, and craftie conueyance, hee answered the Image in this sporting manner; Peace, <hi>Madam,</hi> it is not lawfull for women to speake in the Church.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:17747:8"/>
At <hi>Strasborough</hi> a certaine superstitious old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man resorted much to our <hi>Lady</hi> with sufficient offerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: which when the Priests perceiued, to countenance her Deuotion, they caused the child to speake &amp; thanke her in our <hi>Ladies</hi> armes, which made the woman looke strangely, and speake some-what angerly.

            <p>A Taylor of <hi>Florence,</hi> worshipping Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Church of Saint <hi>Michael Barteldi,</hi> kneeling downe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne in this manner, O glorious and blessed Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> tell me, I pray thee, whether my Wife haue played false, and what shall become of my sonne. Which the Priests and Clarke hearing, lying in wait for such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, either to make sport, or to raise a further profit, made Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> thus reply: My deare sonne, goe in peace, and to morrow thou shalt receiue an answere. The Taylor, I hope, mist not his houre, nor forgot his offertorie: So he made his Petition, &amp; the Image answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Thy Wife hath made thee Cuckold, and thy son shall be hang'd. At which the fellow was so amazed, that he went home enraged, and wanted little of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately making away himselfe through the villany of the Priests. This tale did <hi>Piero de Cosmo de medici,</hi> relate himselfe to diuers of his guests.</p>
            <p>A Priest of <hi>Louaine,</hi> called <hi>Anthony,</hi> hauing solemnly inuited some merry companions to dinner, knew not yet which way to intertaine them: For he had neither meat nor money: at last stepping into a neighbours house, where he was very frequent, and finding the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
<pb facs="tcp:17747:9"/>
absent, he took the pot from the fire, and carried it home vnder his gowne. Thus he not only supplyed his wants, but powring out the meat into some other dish, sent the pot handsomely made cleane, as a pawne to the owner, and borrowed money of it, hauing a Bill of sale for the receit. The good man in the meane while chasing and fretting for the losse of his dinner, and theft of his pot, knew not what to say, till the Maid assured him, there was none there but Sir <hi>Anthony:</hi> hee againe loth to accuse so reuerent a man, and indeed affraid of the danger, was more vexed then before, till the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant looking on the pawne, told him, it was his owne pot: then out of all patience he accused the Priest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Magistrate; but when Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> shewed the Bill of sale, it was turnd to a merriment, and so the theft was shuffled ouer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iacobinas</hi> of <hi>Berne,</hi> and <hi>Franciscans</hi> of <hi>Orleance</hi> got most of their wealth by walking Spirits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting by night to houses, as if <hi>Robin good-fellow</hi> had done the drudgerie to ease the seruants of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>Frier <hi>Reynald</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> louing a mans Wife, and so resorting to the house, was ouer-taken on a sudden with the vnlookt for comming home of her Husband, and had scarce time to leape out of the bed, and carry his cloathes in his hand; the man knocking still, and the Wife making no great haste, some hurly-burly arose: where-vpon, the woman layes the child in the Friers place, and lets in her Husband, who angerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, why she tarried so long? Oh, replyed shee, speaking so lowd, the Frier might heare her, our sonne
<pb facs="tcp:17747:9"/>
had like to haue perished through a fit of the Collicke, so that I was fayne to send for Frier <hi>Reynald</hi> to pray for him, who bade me keepe him warme in the bed, and is himselfe with his Sexton at his deuotion in the Loft. With that, the Frier and his Companion came downe with a booke in his hand; and after solemne courtsey made, told the good man, the child had certain Worms in his Maw, and therefore hee must make a <hi>Statuae</hi> of Wax of his bignesse, and present it to Saint <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Curat of <hi>Ouziane,</hi> neere to <hi>Amboise,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing long had the pleasure of his Hostesse, and bred a great deale of iealousie in her Husband, thought by a crafty tricke to remoue that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, pretending to be gelt: wherevpon hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with one <hi>Peier de Serpens,</hi> borne at <hi>Villan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troies</hi> in <hi>Berry,</hi> for foure crownes to sport with him, and conceale the matter. Which when the Host vnderstood, hee promiseth him twice as much to performe the thing indeed. The Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taking pitie of the man, and despighted at the Friers knauerie, bound him hand and foote, and while he looked the company should make Intercession for him, and so leaue him to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer libertie, the other whipt off his Stones: tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him plainely, his profession was no dallying profession: and so the Host seemed quieted, as being thus reuenged.</p>
            <p>A woman in <hi>Orleans</hi> being in loue with a yong Scholler, who yet was not acquainted with her,
<pb facs="tcp:17747:10"/>
knew no better way to discouer her affection, then by her Frier Confessor, desiring him to giue him good counsell, not to tempt her, nor solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit her any more, especially not to come ouer the wall into her Orchard as he promised. The Frier ouer-taken with her simplicitie, aduised the yong man for the best, and to diuert his loue from her. The yong man againe knowing there was no such matter, and yet apprehensiue of a womans wit, admitted of his good instruction, but instructed himselfe how he nowmight enioy a Sweet-heart: but when the Frier vnderstood how he had been made a Bawd and Pandar for the businesse, hee thought to beat out one nayle with another, and so very knauishly threatned the discouerie, if hee might not share in the bargaine.</p>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Oliuer Mailard,</hi> that when hee saw the wickednesse and Villany of Priests and Friers, he wondred, that the Saints interred in the Church, did not rise and pull out the eyes of the Whore-masters, and Deceiuers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pontanus</hi> saith, that there were certaine Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries at <hi>Valencia,</hi> which by reason of the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Friers, who played the very Bawdes and Pandars to get mony, became loathsome Stewes, and intertained yong Gentlemen, as in Brothell houses, but all vnder colour of deuotion. When any of the Priests knauerie was discouered, there were excuses enough ready to desend them; yea, when they were found kissing of a woman; the answer was, You must suppose he did it to print a blessing on her lips.</p>

What should I name the great abuses of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duigences, and Pardons, and all for money? wherein there were many tricks, and counterfet deuices.</p>
            <p>Certaine cheating Friers hauing pawned their Relicks in a Tauerne, and wanting money to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme them, shewed the people a firebrand, and made them beleeue it was part of the fire, which broyled Saint <hi>Lawrence:</hi> wherevpon according to the ignorance of those times, many gaue them money, which they spent in all vnthriftinesse.</p>
            <p>A Lady sent to pleasure a yong Cardinall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a certaine composition betweene him and her Husband, seemed at first very coy, and for all the basenesse of her Husband, would by no meanes consent to his pleasure, till at last, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible perswasions, faire intreatie, extraordinarie promises, the handsomnesse of his person, and the greatnesse of his estate, shee condiscended vnto him, and seemed well pleased in the alteration: where-vpon shee returnes to her Husband vvith the money, and told him plainely, shee vvas bought and sold, and therfore would returne, and forsake him for euer.</p>
            <p>And thus much of their coozening and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: wherein I pray you take onely this notice, that I meane to giue you but a taste of euery one of the diuisions. For if I should set a Banquet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, or a Feast to feed you, you would rather surfet, then be satisfied; the dishes are so many wherewith I could furnish the Table, and of that
<pb facs="tcp:17747:11"/>
varietie, that you might rather glut and gorge your selues, then content nature with a temperate dyet. Againe, whereas it may be obiected, these were the times of old, there is now great refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation since these enormities were looked into: I answere plainely and directly; the same super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition remaines at this houre, and the Priests doe so preuaile with coozening deceit, and farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht deuices, that in <hi>Spaine</hi> this present yeere 1622. the doctrine of the conception of our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> vvithout sinne, and assumption into Heauen, is newly divulged and ratified, and the contrary opinion reputed Heresie, and the repugners hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hissed at in euery Towne and Citie.</p>

            <p>When souldiers entred into any towne to be lodged, or quartered, the first thing they did, was to hunt after Priests Lemans; and search euery corner for their Whores. And thus much for the generall: Now to particulars.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Franciscan</hi> Frier lodging in the house of a Gentleman of <hi>Perigot,</hi> found the meanes to lye with his Wife vpon her Purification, as vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by confession his resolution. So hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Chamber first, and when hee had taken his pleasure, departed out of the house, excusing his haste to the Porter, by speciall businesse. After he was departed, comes the Gentleman indeed, and found by his Wiues speech, that some body had wronged him: which so amazed him, that he amazed her by saying, he was abused. Shee with teares assured him, that none was in the house but the Frier, and her Brother: which was no sooner spoken, but vp hee gets, and to the Porter hee comes, and there vnderstands, how the Frier was departed. After him he followes, but not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking him, hee returnes home againe. In his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb facs="tcp:17747:12"/>
the Wife enraged to bee so deflowred, hangs her selfe, and in the mischance ouerthrew a little child dead to the ground: the noise rais'd the house, and at last comes the brother, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sister hangd, supposing her Husband had done it, in some fit of iealousie, out of doores he flings, and meetes him returning home; in vvhich moode hee sets vpon him with Villaine, and defiance; and so they wound one another to death.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Franciscans</hi> of <hi>Strasborough,</hi> before they were expelled, accustomed to steale away mens Wiues, and keepe them cloystered like yong No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, cutting their hayre, and charming them with feare of death; till at last a Butchers Wife was sent in the same habit with the Cater to buy meate of her Husband; who eying her very narrowly, as hauing seene the face before, could not be restrained, but layd hands vpon her, and so after great adoe, all was discouered, &amp; the Friers banished.</p>
            <p>Two <hi>Franciscans</hi> hauing no money to pay the Ferry, rauished the Woman that carried them, and so pleased her.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Franciscan</hi> in <hi>Perigot</hi> found the meane, by obscuring himselfe in the bride-chamber, to lye with a Bride, before her Husband came to her, and escaped, for all that the houshold could doe, when they heard of it.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Franciscan</hi> by <hi>Lyons,</hi> married his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frier, in the habit of a Scholler, to a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb facs="tcp:17747:12"/>
Daughter of great riches and account, making them beleeue, hee was an heire to great reuenues, and sent to <hi>Lyons,</hi> as it were vnder his tutelage: but at last the Mother and Daughter comming to heare Masse, (as much deuoted to this Order) espied her Husband answering the Priest in his Friers weed, which for the time they concealed, till they came home, and at night, as his custome was, he likewise kept his houres: but being in bed, the mother comes in, and layed hold of his hands, while his Daughter pull'd off his Cap, and discouered her shauen crowne, and so hee was apprehended, and sent to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
            <p>There are more Stories of the <hi>Franciscans,</hi> then of any other Order, &amp; they were euermore played vpon, because they pretended more holines, and sanctitie of life. They builded their Houses and Cels very neere the Nunneries; insomuch that many merrily said, Heere were the Barnes, and there were the Threshers.</p>
            <p>It is reported, that when <hi>Henry</hi> the second was King of <hi>France,</hi> and wanted a great summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, a certaine Lord wisht him to sell the Friers beds; and when the King demanded, where they then should lye; he presently replyde, With the Nunnes. But, quoth the King, there are more Monkes a great deale then Nunnes. Why, said the other, one Nunne may very well haue fiue or sixe Monkes.</p>

            <p>A Frier minorite of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> falling in loue with the young Wife of old <hi>Agatha</hi> the Physician, taught her a tricke to faine her selfe pained with the disease of the Mother: For which the Frier must be sent for, and bring in the Relikes of Saint <hi>Bernardine.</hi> Which hee did, commanding all the company in the Chamber to auoid; and so hee went to bed to the Physicians Wife, while his companion lay with the Maid. But ere all vvas done, home comes the Old man, and found the Friers breeches vnder his Wiues pillow, which she confessed, as a part of the Relicks, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, for feare of a relapse. Whereupon the Maid went to the Friers, to tell what had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: who camedowne merrily with all the other ceremonies of the cure, and so put his breeches together with the other Reliques.</p>
            <p>The old Tale of the <hi>Abbesse</hi> in <hi>Lombardy</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to this day; who hearing that one of her Nunnes was in labour, came in all haste to chide her; but belike shee was puzzled in the darke: for in stead of her Vaile, she had put on a Monkes Breeches, that lay with her the same night: so comming to the Nunne, shee began to reuile her, who forall herpaine, soberly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Good <hi>Madam</hi> mend your plaister, and all shall bee well inough, I warrant you.

Wherevpon the Dukes Secretarie was very busie to examine him, hoping hee would name some, at whose husbands hee might make sport, and laughter. In which iollitie, hee vrgeth him againe and againe to set down the women. Why then, quoth the Hermite, and you bee so hastie, write downe your owne Wife first. I hope you may imagine hee was amazed; the Duke smiled, and the whole company stood silent, for feare their turne should be next.</p>

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the man, who was thus abused, vnderstood of so small a punishment, he lies in wait for him, and cruelly beates him; so that hee is brought before his Iudge to receiue punishment: who awarded him not to come into a Tauern in 3. moneths. At which the Bishop seemed much offended, till the
<pb facs="tcp:17747:14"/>
Iudge answered: My Lord, considering the first abuse, I hope it is as great a punishment for him not to visit a Tauerne, as penance for the Priest not to trouble a Church.</p>

            <p>To name other places, and other commissions of whoredome and fornication, were infinit; but so it was, and will be in all Nations, where impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and superstition ouercomes true zeale and deuotion: yet because there were certaine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men that did obserue state in their impiety, and thought scorne to goe to common Brothels, or prostituted Whores, but kept women by the name of sequestration, and so liued more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then the rest of poorer Priests; I will also name you some of them, as among the Monkes of Saint <hi>Bennet, Christopher Iames</hi> had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and vse of three married women: <hi>William, Abbot</hi> of <hi>Bristow</hi> had foure Whores.

in those dayes, and then, if according to the Poet,—<hi>sic paruis componere megna solebam:</hi> wee could step into <hi>France, Italy, Spaine, Germany,</hi> and other Countries, where the Clergy bare the sway, and gaue the example, and so pull out the dust and rubbish of their vnswept corners: Oh what a deale of filth, and a dunghill of noysome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, would arise, and what a mountaine of sinne would this sinne make!

Doe they not feed on the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Lambes of the fold, and stretch out their limmes on beds of Iuory?

            <p>There was a certaine Cardinall in <hi>Rome,</hi> that, to make demonstration of humilitie, had alwaies a net for his Table-Cloth: but preferred to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> he bade take away the Net; for he had that which he fish'd for.</p>
            <p>When English <hi>Cromwell</hi> had a great suite to <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> he acquainted himselfe with his custome, and dyet, and so inuented a dish of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoury and pleasant gelly, which he brought in, in a fantasticall manner, with a true mans song, a thing much in vse in those dayes; and so vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Holinesse were pleased with the sport, or delighted with the dainty, hee granted his request.</p>

               <hi>Becket</hi> himselfe was accused for an Hereticke, as eating Capons on Saint <hi>Markes</hi> day, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding like an Epicure on prohibited times, so that he should haue beene attached, had not the Holy

I could name the rest, or at least many more: but these, I hope, shall suffice for the subiect in hand: and if any haue forgot the vsance of their owne Countrey, let them still demaund of the trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in other places, who haue frequented the Monasteries of <hi>Europe,</hi> and I hope they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the truth without blushing.</p>

            <p>Are not the Priests stil set on worke to incroach vpon the flexible nature of men and women, to perswade them to wilfull pouerty, that they might bee inriched vvith their gifts and Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and haue their Monasteries augmented

            <p>What an infinit treasure did <hi>Cardinall Wolsey</hi> conuey out of this Realme, for the ransom of <hi>Pope Clement,</hi> and briberie of the Cardinals for his owne aduancement to the Papacie, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ambition?</p>
            <p>Is not that ridiculous tale worth the reciting, of the man that buried his Dogge, for which hee was accused, and brought before the Bishop? Which he answered in this manner; O my Lord, if you knew the wisedome of this Dogge, you would not condemne mee! For at his death hee bequeathed a Legacy to your Lordship of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred crownes, knowing your wants, and great occasions. By which excuse he was remitted, and the Bishop pacified. But was not this either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Atheisme, or plaine robbery.</p>
            <p>Was and is not the <hi>Croysade</hi> a tricke of thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, to make men beleeue, they must pay so much money, or be damned?</p>
            <p>Did not a ghostly Father preach in the open Pulpit, that when any money was giuen for a soule departed, the soules in Purgatory hearing it tingle in the Bason, did laugh for ioy?</p>
            <p>Was not this the very cause, that Christ did exprobate the Pharises for buying and selling in
<pb facs="tcp:17747:17"/>
the Temple, saying plainely, this should bee a house of Prayer, but ye haue made it a den of theeues.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Casall</hi> one finding three hundred Crownes, confessed the same to a Priest, who so terrified him with damnation, if it were not restored, that the silly fellow deliuered him the money to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it backe againe to the owner (as he by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration would finde out) but hee deceiued him, and spent the same amongst Whores, and pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companions.</p>
            <p>A Curtizan in <hi>Venice</hi> lying very sicke, sent for a Frier to confesse her sinnes: and so opening a Casket, in which was our <hi>Ladies</hi> Psalter bound in Gold; the Frier peeping in, saw beside a 1000. <hi>Zhekinos</hi> lying by. For the time he said little, but afterward found a better time to purloyne the same away.</p>
            <p>Was not the <hi>Hermit</hi> of the Valley of <hi>Monte Negro</hi> a iolly fellow, who with two Friers kept the passages in strange habits, and robbed all commers?</p>
            <p>Did not certaine Priests frequent the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers lodgings at <hi>Sienna,</hi> and still as their exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came from their Parents, they would either steale some, or be the cause of vnnecessary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and when money failed, they would either haue bookes, or apparell?</p>

            <p>I could name you a thousand of these Stories, both to proue their generall and particular thefts, some serious, some ridiculous, some indifferent. But these shall suffice at this instant, and I make no question, there is no Reader, or Searcher of Inuentories, but lights vpon many more: and although some with <hi>Licurgus</hi> law allow of theft, to make men the more wary and cautelous of their goods; and other-some excuse them, as men subiect to imperfections, or politicke Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, that may increase their estates by thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deuices: Yet the true-hearted Christian wil confesse such theeueries, the branches of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and if they condemne them in other men, will much more abhorre them in the Professors of Religion, and Priests of the Clergie.</p>

But before I come to particulars, giue mee leaue to tell you, I could discouer many horrible and fearefull executions: many notorious and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable massacres: many grieuous and sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narious persecutions, I could tell you, that the Priests perswaded silly women, that abortion was no sinne.</p>
            <p>I could also adde, that in the gardens of Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, was alwayes a tree or two of <hi>Sauine,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17747:18"/>
which they say the Nunnes vsed to drinke stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Wine: now the property of <hi>Sauine</hi> is to destroy any thing condensed in the wombe, and so you may iudge of the cause: And so I come to the rest.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, a Franciscan Frier in <hi>Flanders,</hi> came one night into a Gentlemans house, and after he had murthered some seruants, tooke the Gentlewoman perforce, and dis-robed her of her apparell, putting a short garment on her, which hee brought with him, of purpose to steale her away to the Monastery, and so threatning her with death, if shee spake or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the matter, though shee met with her Husband, hurried her out of doores, riding with a long Pike staffe, and a short Dagger disguized.</p>
            <p>But as he posted away in this manner, hee met with her husband indeed and his man. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, as she was threatned and coniured, passed by, and durst not speake: and so the Frier followed as churlishly. The seruant had onely a glimpse of her, and knew her; yea, hee discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Frier also, telling his Master, what had hapned. But he by reason of the impossibilitie of the matter, as hee supposed, told him hee was a foole, or mad, and so would haue rid home without any more adoe: but the seruant would needs goe backe againe to take his better view. Which when the Frier perceiued, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, that his knauerie should be reuealed, he took the aduantage of the mans peering vnder her
<pb facs="tcp:17747:19"/>
Vaile, &amp; so with a violent stroke, feld him to the ground with his braines dasht out. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man seeing his man fall, returned in fury, and had the fortune to cloze with the Frier, and so strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling together, at last ouerthrew him; which when his Wife perceiued, she returned and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, wounding the Frier with his owne Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thus was he taken, and afterward examined, and adiudged to dye: and so hee was publikely burnt.</p>
            <p>The Lord Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ligoures,</hi> cousin to the Marshall of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi> committed Incest with his wiues Mother, and had diuers children by her; yea, hee so loued her, or if you will, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Lust toward her, that he reuealed the same in confession to his ghostly father, who to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the Lord, told him plainely he might kill his Wife, and so bee rid of her. This was dangerous and bloudy, and therevpon hee made a stay, till the Frier andaciously told him, he would be the executioner for his sake: and so the murther was committed by certaine Ruffians, but at last de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, for which the Frier was publikely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
            <p>A Priest of <hi>Fonsigney,</hi> called <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> vnder the dominion of <hi>Thiez,</hi> then Gouernour of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua,</hi> out of meere malice and heart-burning, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out his brothers eyes: not so contented, hee brought him to <hi>Chambery,</hi> to a Saint called Saint <hi>Iuery,</hi> and then in great request; and as hee was passing ouer a Bridge, would haue throwne him
<pb facs="tcp:17747:19"/>
into the Riuer: but missing of his purpose, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of greater company, hee with certaine as wicked as himselfe, kill'd him in a Barne.</p>
            <p>A Priest called Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> came to <hi>Autuns</hi> Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> to visit the Curate of Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew des ars,</hi> who stood betweene him, and a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice: but not willing to tarry the time, and growing enraged to be so long disappointed, hee tooke an opportunitie, and set vpon him and his man, and with his companions kill'd them both: For which he was afterward executed.</p>
            <p>In an Inne at <hi>Soysons,</hi> the good mans Daughter of the house had a child vnlawfully, which was brought vp in the house to his great griefe; and therefore he could neuer endure it, because it still put him in minde of her shame. At last hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued to put her to a Nunnery with a certaine piece of money: and so hee bargained with a Priest called <hi>Hector,</hi> a Bakers sonne of <hi>Moyen.</hi> But this Varlet tooke the child, and without any more adoe cut her throat, throwing the body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a heape of Nettles. But see the goodnesse of God! hard by, was a Sexton making a graue in a Churchyard, to whom he proffered money to bury the body: but he suspitious of the murther, reuealed all he knew to the Magistrate. And so the parties were examined, and the murther found out.</p>
            <p>A Priest of <hi>Orleans</hi> iealous of a Whore which he kept, and loth to bee further tormented, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her to a Tauerne, vnder colour of kindnesse,
<pb facs="tcp:17747:20"/>
and there beginning cause of displeasure, at last cut her throat.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Gelderland,</hi> raised warre for the Duke-dome of <hi>Limbourg,</hi> in which the Bishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> as assistant to the Earle, was taken prisoner, and kept seuen yeere, till all conditions were accomplished. Thus was he in the custody of the Earle of <hi>Mount</hi> in <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalt,</hi> whom hee could not corrupt for his escape with any promise or gifts, which so inraged him, that in his heart he sware reuenge. At last hee is set at liberty, and all vnkindnesse seemed to bee forgotten; insomuch that the Bishop came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit the Duke, &amp; in his returne intreated the Earle to accompany him to <hi>Tuits,</hi> a towne standing ouer against <hi>Cullen;</hi> which he did, suspecting no harme: but the Bishop had liued in Ambuscado for him, and not onely imprisoned him, but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot day vsed him in this maner: he script him naked, and most cruelly put him into an iron Cage, all nointed ouer with honey, and so set him in the Sunne, where Flyes, Hornets, Wasps, and Bees, tormented the poore Earle to death.</p>
            <p>Two Canons of <hi>Cullen</hi> vpon displeasure against <hi>Herman Grin,</hi> and yet dissembling their malice, inuited him to dinner; and in stead of friendly fare, thrust him into a roome, where was kept a hungry Lyon: but the valiant man winding his Cloake about his arme, drew his Rapier, &amp; kill'd the Beast, and so scaped the reuenge of these wicked priests.</p>

            <p>In the time of <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour, there was a cruell Bishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> called <hi>Hatto,</hi> who hated the poore, and said they were worse then Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and Rats, and fit for nothing but to bee burnt: wherevpon in a time of Dearth hee filled a barne full of them, and set it on fire, consuming them to cynders: For which, the iudgement of God fell vpon him, and he was deuoured of Rats aliue. For when he fled from all places, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him in great multitudes, he went into a tower in the midst of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> called the Rats-Tower for euer after, whither the Rats swamme after him; but it lay not in the strength or policy of man to deliuer him: For there they deuoured him aliue.</p>

            <p>A Monke called <hi>Heran,</hi> presuming of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by reason of his holinesse, and austeritie of life, after fifty yeeres was perswaded by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to throw himselfe into a deepe Well, from

whence preserued and taken out by miracle, hee could not bee perswaded, or remoued from any other opinion, but that it was an Angell appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, to make him glorious to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>

            <p>About the yeere 1513. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> was poisoned in the Sacrament by a <hi>Dominican</hi> Frier, which <hi>Baptista Ignatius</hi> affirmes, and <hi>Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> recites the reason, from a motiue of <hi>Clement</hi> the fift, because hee grew too strong in <hi>Italy:</hi> but what followed: many Friers of that Order were slaine afterwards by the Souldiers.</p>

            <p>It is a common tale of a pretty Boy, that set the Priests Barne on fire, and speaking to him in his owne Latine, all was burnt, because he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him not.</p>

               <hi>Pogius</hi> the <hi>Florentine</hi> hath a hundred examples of the Priests of his time, that knew no Latine, when they came to receiue Orders, they are called his <hi>facetiae:</hi> and indeed he sets downe the stories, meerely for iests and laughter.</p>

            <p>When a certaine Priest read the Gospell of Christs feeding so many men with a fewe loaues and Fishes, he named 500. for 5000. at which the Clarke being discontented, stepped to him, and told him he was mistaken, it was 5000. Hold thy peace, replied the Priest, I pray God they beleeue this number.</p>
            <p>There was a certaine Priest, that supposed <hi>dignus,</hi> was Latine to dine: for when he came to the Bishop to be preferred to a Benefice, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

            <p>A <hi>Franciscan,</hi> putting on a short garment, and leauing off his breeches of purpose, vsed such em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticall speeches and gestures to the people which stood before him, about the passion of Christ on a good Friday, that they fell a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but such as were behinde, seeing his naked buttocks, as he bowed himselfe, fell also a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he proued so ridiculous in the action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Liciencis,</hi> another <hi>Franciscan,</hi> could cause either sorrow, or laughter, by the enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his words, and manner of his gesture: yea he had a tricke to winne wagers with his pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companions of eithers enforcement.</p>
            <p>A Frier hauing a Sweet-hart, who loued him
<pb facs="tcp:17747:28"/>
extraordinarily, but could not endure his habit, he took occasion one day to preach of the warres against the <hi>Turk:</hi> and comming to the point of choosing a Generall, or Captaine, hee threw off the gowne, and preached in the habit of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, which became him so well, that his Sweet-heart seeing him, was much delighted with his presence. And when for this and other foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries hee was sent for before the Cardinals, hee answered them very merrily and reuerently, that he did it to please his Loue, not in any contempt of his Order, or the Catholike Religion.</p>
            <p>A certaine Curate complained to his Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this sort; Alas, what would you haue me doe, O my Parishioners? You bring me no offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and I see none of you dye; How shall I liue then, thinke ye?</p>
            <p>The Franciscans of <hi>Enreux</hi> counterfetted a Ghost, or a Spirit, to procure money; and a yong Franciscan Nouice, called <hi>Harecourt,</hi> at <hi>Orleans,</hi> counterfetted the ghost of the Prouost Marshals Wife, because he gave but sixe crownes to the Franciscans.</p>

            <p>Doe you thinke it is not worth the laughing at, to obserue the many Masses, wherewith the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Priests maintaine their Gluttony, in ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, singing, quauering, mumbling, grumbling, and pattering great, little, high, low Masses, with a sop of Wine, &amp; dry Masses; Masses for quick and dead; Masses <hi>ad requiem;</hi> Masses for all Ladies, pitty, vertue, good newes, and such like: Masses of Saints, <hi>Sebastian, Godegran, Guerlichon, Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergo, Andoch.</hi> Masses for 11000.

            <p>A Gentleman being reproued for not vailing his Bonet, when the Holy Water was cast on his head; answered, that if it had that vertue to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to Purgatory, it would no doubt goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his Hat well enough.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Burgandy,</hi> neere a Village called <hi>Chaseule,</hi> a Countryman hearing Ringers, went into the Church, and kneeled before a Crucifix standing neere the Belfry, which fell downe and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dashed out his braines, so that the Ringers were faine to leaue worke, to carry him home. Vpon his recouery he comes to the same Church
<pb facs="tcp:17747:30"/>
againe, and findes a yong smiling Crucifix in the place of the old, (for the other was broken in the fall) which looking stedfastly vpon, he could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare no longer, but thus began, Cast as good a countenance toward me as thou wilt, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trust thee.

            <p>When Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth was told by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, that hee needed to feare nothing, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he had the keyes of heauen, and the treasurie of the Church. He answered in this sort: Thou knowest that he which hath sold a thing, hath no longer right nor interest therein; therefore seeing I haue sold heauen and all to others, I am afraid I shall haue nothing to doe there my selfe.</p>
            <p>When Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the second cast S. <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes into <hi>Tiber,</hi> and tooke Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> sword, he said alowd, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes would stand him in no stead for the Warres, but Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> sword would helpe him well.</p>
            <p>The manner was among the Priests that went a begging for Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> to heat their little Crosses, or brazen Images: which when the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came to kisse, and felt it very hot, they would tell them, that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> was not pleas'd with their Almes, and the poore women so frighted, would returne and fetch better.</p>
            <p>There is a Story of <hi>Pudding</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Berry</hi> to this purpose. A Priests mayd powred swines bloud into a great Latine Bason,
<pb facs="tcp:17747:30"/>
which had the Image of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> embossed in it, and whereinto the Curate was wont to put his offrings, as it stood for showe vpon the Altar. Now it happned, that a droppe of the bloud was vnwash't out of it, and so perceiued on <hi>S.

            <p n="11">11. Concerning their Impieties: I will neither <note place="margin">11.

            <p>When the Pope goteh on progresse, Christs body is sent before with the baggage, and when the Pope is neere, then it goeth out to meete him, while all the Gallants of <hi>Rome</hi> attend on the Pope.</p>
            <p>They make Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Dominick,</hi> equall to Christ in diuers things; and in some, superiour: For they call Saint <hi>Francis, Iesum Tipicum,</hi> that is, a figuratiue Iesus, and say plainely, that <hi>Dominick</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> did more Miracles then Christ.</p>
            <p>In the conuenticle of <hi>Trent, Cornelius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> said, <hi>Papa lux venit in mundum,</hi> The Pope the light came into the world: and <hi>Simon Begnius,</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Laterane,</hi> called <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, The Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>Te Leo beatissime, saluatorem expectauimus,</hi> that is, We, blessed <hi>Leo,</hi> haue looked for thee our Sauiour.</p>

               <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. denied the Immortalitie of the Soule, and was conuinced of Incest, Sodomitry, and Atheisme.

diuers Bankes, called <hi>Monti de Pieta,</hi> as appeareth in <hi>Onuphrius</hi> in the liues of <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3. <hi>Paul</hi> the 4. and <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. <hi>Vrbane</hi> the 6. would sell Crosses, Chalices, and Images. <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9. would bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for money for Benefices, and when it was scarce, take Pigs, Cattel, and Wares, which his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents should vent out againe.

               <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. brought such a scandall vpon the sale of Indulgences in <hi>Germany,</hi> as comming then to <hi>Magdalene</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> honest Sister, that all the
<pb facs="tcp:17747:34"/>
Country was mooued, and complained thereof: But <hi>Theoderick</hi> testifieth in his booke, that <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the ninth sold benefices as he was hearing of Masse: and <hi>Theoderick Trudo</hi> hath a pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, That Christs sheep-folds were broken downe with hammers of siluer.</p>
            <p>The time of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. in <hi>England</hi> was so deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Emperour, that hee reprehended the King, for suffering his Country to bee so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully empouerished by the Pope: For <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> writes, that at one time they had as much money out of England, as remained there; except Church ornaments, Plate, and Iewels, &amp;c. yea, <hi>Bonner</hi> in his preface to <hi>Gardiners</hi> Booke <hi>De vera obedientia,</hi> saies plainly, That the Popes spoiles did equall the Kings reuennues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the 9. of <hi>France,</hi> in his Pragmatical sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely complaineth of the Popes exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but absolutely forbideth them. Whereupon the Uniuersitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> in an appeale from <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, taxeth the insatiable Auarice of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as drawing from thence 2500000. crownes a yeere; confounding lawes and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, by expectatiues, and reseruations, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of diuers faculties comming from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iames</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ments</hi> payed diuers summes of money for his Pall: <hi>and Valla</hi> made a treatise against the forged deuotion of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine;</hi> accusing the Pope, for selling the gifts of the holy Ghost: wherein he did worse then <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17747:35"/>
or <hi>Cateline,</hi> or any robber of the common treasure. But <hi>Theoderick</hi> compares the Popes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer to the Sea, into which all Riuers runne, and yet it runnes not ouer: yea, he sayeth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Popes officers were so many tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Hell, to scourge the people. <hi>Alan Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> testifies, that Gods Sanctuarie was a common market place for the sale of benefices. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Salsburie</hi> cries out, that the Pope became intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, &amp; delighted in the spoiles of the Church: <hi>Vesperge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sis</hi> affirmeth, that all men sought to <hi>Rome</hi> for dispensation of offences, and were released for money. But <hi>Iohannes Andreas</hi> goes further, exclaiming that <hi>Rome</hi> was founded by robbers, and yet retaineth a sent of her first liquor; as if hee should say, <hi>Quo semel est imbuta recens, seruabit odorem, pesta diu.</hi> I could here also recite the 100. grieuances of <hi>

            <p>But if I now should tell you, after all this get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of wealth, and amassing of treasure, their pride and sumptuousnes in the spending of the same, you would be amazed and wonder, with what spirit they durst iustifie such sacrilegios, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and vnparaleld magnificence; wherein Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come short of their Regality. <hi>Baptista Fulgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> recordeth, of one <hi>Peter Riarus,</hi> at first a Frier minorite, that being created Cardinall by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. he had his Gownes of cloth of gold; the
<pb facs="tcp:17747:35"/>
Couerings and Tikes of his bed of the same, and all other furniture of the best Silke. At <hi>Rome</hi> hee made a Feast to <hi>Elenor</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> as shee was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to marry the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> called <hi>Hercules de Est,</hi> which lasted seuen houres with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and pompous playes, and liued in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of Voluptuousnesse and cost, that all <hi>Italy</hi> admired his wealth.</p>
            <p>Another had a Concubine called <hi>Tiresia,</hi> and kept her publikely with shooes set with Pearle and precious Stones: but this is common, and the Cardinals at this houre glory in such excesse.</p>
            <p>A Franciscan of <hi>Millane,</hi> called <hi>Sanson,</hi> had so enriched himselfe by Bribery, Simony, Sacrilege, and other exactions, that hee offered 120000. du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kats for the Popedome: but this kinde of life and expences is so customary in <hi>Rome,</hi> that I need in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on no further particulars, especially, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Curtezans, which name had originall from the courtlinesse and maiestie of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; so that you shall read, that in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> the 5. which was then esteem'd a time of restraint, there were but 45000. notorious Curtezans in <hi>Rome.</hi> But what need I goe so farre as <hi>Rome</hi> for wealthy Prelates, when wee had in <hi>England</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. a Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> who lent the King 20000. pound Sterling to goe into <hi>France?</hi> In the time of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 1. a Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> able to buylan Earledome.

            <p>NOw ye Lords, that entertaine these Priests with familiar imbraces, and admit them to your Tables and Closets, as if you would rely vpon the Verdict of some Oracle; whereas yet in other Countreys they are euen derided of their best Supporters: Now ye Ladies, that in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hang about their necks with admiration, as if you were to runne to touch the hemme of Christs garment, supposing all sanctitie and piety to bee the ornaments of their hypocrisie: Now see, Gentiles, that are so easily seduced with impostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cunning of dissimuled holinesse, and wil not beleeue the incantation of <hi>Syrens,</hi> whose end is destruction, or to deuoure your soules: Now yee people, that are transported with vaine appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gew-gaw superstition, to please the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man with pastime, and trumperies; seeing these things are so, which I haue recited, being not the tenth of that which I could enlarge: May I not well say to you, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> O ye Fooles, who hath bewitched you? What a <hi>Pope</hi> doe you adore? The Man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Beast with seuen heads, and ten Horns, &amp;c? What Priests and Prelates doe yee entertaine, that will

leade you from the pure Waters of <hi>Shiloa,</hi> where you may wash and be cleane without money, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the durty puddles of filthinesse, where yet you must be at great expences, to purchase monstrous deformitie?</p>
            <p>What doctrine doe you make much of, of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and pollution, which cannot endure the sunny splendour of the Word of God; so that without controuersie, if the blind lead the blind, both fall into the Ditch, and in the end you shall bee so besmeared with the deuices of wicked Traditions, that neither <hi>Culanais,</hi> nor a thousand Riuers of Oyle shall make you cleane?</p>
            <p>Returne therefore betimes, I beseech you, to Wisedomes Feast, to the balme of <hi>Gilead:</hi> to bring in the Arke, and to re-edifie <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Oh, returne, returne, I say, for Gods sake, for Christs sake, for Religions sake, for your owne soules sakes, that you may see the difference betweene the bloudy Scarlet Robes of the Cardinals, and the innocent white garments of the Saints. That ye may heare the voice of, Come ye blessed; and, not, Goe you cursed: And that you may come before the Lambe, freely with the signature of righteousnesse and repentance, and not at all bee beholding to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Keyes, which I dare sweare are not yet found, since the <hi>Pope</hi> cast them into <hi>Tyber.</hi>
