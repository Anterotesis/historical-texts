         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

againſt ſinners, and yet that ſinne, that broad way path and high-way to hell, is attempted with a delectation and pleaſure, ſo craftie and ſubtill are the baits and lures of the deceiver, and ſo void of ſpirituall wiſedome is the ſoule-murdering ſinner. But if due conſideration were had of the wages of ſinne, and the reward of unrighteouſneſſe, and to what bitterneſſe it will turne in the end, it would make us leſſe bold to ſinne, and more fearefull to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if wee would take into our company for a daily conſort, the pale memory of death, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he ſummeth us after this life. Death it ſelfe is very fearefull, but much more terrible, in regard of the judgement it warneth us

unto. Imagine to ſee a ſinner lie on his departing bed, burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and tyred with the grievous and heavie load of all his former treſpaſſes, goared with the ſting and pricke of a feſtered conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, feeling the crampe of death wreſting at his heart ſtrings, ready to make the ruthfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce betweene ſoule and body, panting for breath, and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a cold and fatall ſweat, wearied with ſtrugling againſt the deadly pangs: Oh how much would he give for an houre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance! at what rate would he value a daies contrition! Then worlds would bee worthleſſe, in reſpect of a little reſpite, a ſhort truce would ſeeme more precious than the treaſures of Empires,

nothing would bee ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a moment of time, which now by moneths and yeeres is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly ſpent.</p>
            <p>How inconſolable were his caſe, his friends being fled, his ſences frighted, his thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, his memorie decaied, his whole minde agaſt, and no part able to performe that it ſhould, but onely his guiltie conſcience peſtered with ſinne, continually upbraiding him with bitter accuſations? what would hee thinke then (ſtripped out of this mortall weed, and turned both out of the ſervice and houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roome of this world) hee muſt paſſe before a moſt ſevere Iudge, carrying in his owne conſcience his enditement written, and a

<pb facs="tcp:25597:6"/>
company, and the eternitie of all thoſe puniſhments. Would you thinke them wiſe that would daily in ſo weighty matters, and idlely play away the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to prevent theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable calamities? Would you then account it ſecure, to nurſe in your boſome ſo many ougly Serpents as ſinnes are, or to foſter in your ſoule ſo many malicious accuſers, as mortall faults are?</p>
            <p>Would you not then thinke one life too little to repent for ſo many iniquities, everie one whereof were enough to caſt you into thoſe everlaſting and unſpeakeable torments? Why then doe wee not (at the leaſt) devote that ſmall remnant of
<pb facs="tcp:25597:6"/>
theſe our latter dayes, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an attonement with God, that our conſciences may be free from this eternall danger? Who would relie the everlaſting affaires of the life to come upon the gliding ſlipperineſſe, and running ſtreame of our uncertaine life?</p>
            <p>It is a prepoſterous pollicie (in any wiſe conceit) to fight againſt God till our weapons bee blunted, our forces conſumed, our limmes impotent, and our breath ſpent; and then when wee fall for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and have fought our ſelves almoſt dead, to preſume on his mercy. It were a ſtrange peece of Art, and a very exorbitant courſe, while the Ship is ſound, the Pylot well, the Marriners ſtrong, the gale favourable, and the Sea calme,
<pb facs="tcp:25597:7"/>
to lie idle at rode: and when the Ship leakes, the Pylot were ſicke, the Marriners faint, the ſtormes boyſterous, and the Sea turmoyled with ſurges, to launch forth for a voyage into a farre Countrey: yet ſuch is the skill of our evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, who though in the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of health, and in the perfect uſe of reaſon, they cannot reſolve to weigh the ankers that withhold them from God, nevertheleſſe, feed themſelves with a ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that when their ſences are aſtonied, their wits distracted, their underſtanding dusked, and both body and minde racked and tormented with the throbs and gripes of a mortall ſickneſſe, then will they thinke of the weightieſt matters, ad become Saints, when
<pb facs="tcp:25597:7"/>
they are ſcarſe able to behave themſelves like reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? being then preſumed to bee leſſe then men: for how can he that is aſſaulted with an unſetled conſcience, diſtrained with the wringing fits of his dying fleſh, maimed in all his abilities, and circled in with ſo many encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, be thought of due diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſpoſe of his chiefeſt jewell, which is his ſoule? No, no, they that will loyter in ſeed time, and begin then to ſow when others begin to reape: they that will riot out their health, and caſt their accounts when they can ſcarſely ſpeake: they that will ſlumber out the day, and enter their journey when the light doth faile them, let them blame their owne folly, if they die
<pb facs="tcp:25597:8"/>
in debt, and eternall beggerie, and fall headlong into the lapſe of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perdition.</p>
            <p>Great cauſe have wee then to have an hourely watchfull care over our ſoule, being ſo dangerous aſſaulted and environed: moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly entreating the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to be our aſſured defence, and let us paſſe the day in mourning, the night in watching and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and our whole time in plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamenting, falling downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground humbled in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes, having loſt the garment of Chriſt, that hee may receive what the perſecuting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would have ſpoyled every ſhort ſigh will not bee ſufficient ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor every knocke a warrant to getin.

Lord, and ſhall not be accepted: the fooliſh Virgins did knocke, but were not admitted: <hi>Judas</hi> had ſome ſorrow, and yet died deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Foreſlow not (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) to be converted unto God, and make not a daily lingering of thy repaire unto him: for thou ſhalt finde the ſuddenneſſe of his wrath and revenge not ſlacke to deſtroy ſinners. For which cauſe, let no man ſojourne long in ſinfull ſecurity, or poſt over his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance untill feare enforce him to it, but let us frame our premiſes as we would finde our concluſion, endeavouring to live as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to die: let us not offer the maine crop to the Divell, and ſet God to gleane the reproofe of his harveſt: let us not gorge the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb facs="tcp:25597:9"/>
with our faireſt fruits, and turne God to the filthy ſcraps of his leavings: but let us truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate both ſoule and body to his ſervice, whoſe right they are, and whoſe ſervice they owe; that ſo in the evening of our life we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to a Chriſtian reſt, cloſing up the day of our life with a cleare ſunne-ſet, that leaving all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe behind us, we may carry in our conſciences the light of grace: and ſo eſcaping the horrour of an eternall night, paſſe from a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall day, to an everlaſting morrow.</p>

O life (ſaith he) prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Almighty God for his friends, a bleſſed life, a ſecure life, a quiet life, a beautifull life, a cleane life, a chaſt life, a holy life; a life that knoweth no death, a life without ſadneſſe, without labour, without griefe, without trouble, without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, without feare, without variety, without alteration; a life repleniſhed with all beautie and dignity; where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemy that can offend, nor delight that can annoy, where love is perfect, and no feare at all, where the day is everlaſting, and the ſpirit of all is one; where Almighty God is ſeene face to face, who is the onely

meate whereupon they feed without loathſomeneſſe: it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth mee to conſider thy brightneſſe, and thy treaſures doe rejoyce my longing heart. The more I conſider thee, the more I am ſtriken in love with thee. The great deſire I have of thee, doth wonderfully delight me, and no leſſe pleaſure is it to me, to keepe thee in my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. O life moſt happy, O kingdome truly bleſſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no death nor end, neither yet ſucceſſion of time, where the day continuing ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more without night, knoweth not any mutation; where the victorious Conqueror being joyned with thoſe everlaſting quires of Angels, and having
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25597:15"/>
his head crowned with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of glory, ſingeth unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God one of the ſongs of <hi>Sion.</hi> Oh happy, yea, and moſt happy ſhould my ſoule be, if when the race of this my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage is ended, I might bee worthy to ſee thy glory, thy bleſſedneſſe, thy beauty, the wals and gates of thy Citie, thy ſtreets, thy lodgings, thy noble Citizens, and thine omnipotent King in his moſt glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie. The ſtones of thy wals are precious, thy gates are ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with bright pearles, thy ſtreets are of very fine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gold, in which there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faile perpetuall praiſes; thy houſes are paved with rich ſtones, wrought throughout

Faire and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in thy delights art thou O <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> our mother, none of thoſe things are ſuffered in thee, that are ſuffered here. There is great diverſitie betweene thy things and the things that wee doe continually ſee in this life. In thee is never ſeene neither darkeneſſe nor night, neither yet any change of time. The light that ſhineth in thee, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neither of lampes, nor of Sunne or Moone, nor yet of bright glittering Starres, but God that proceedeth of God, and the light that commeth of

light, is he that giveth clearenes unto thee. Even the very King of Kings himſelfe keepeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reſidence in the middeſt of thee, compaſſed about with his officers and ſervants. There doe the Angels in their orders and Quires ſing a moſt ſweere and melodious harmony. There is celebrated a perpetuall ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and feaſt with every one of them that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth thither, after his departure out of this pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:25597:17"/>
Virgins, which have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both the pleaſures of the world, and the frailty of their owne nature; there are the young men and young women, more ancient in vertue than in yeares; there are the ſheepe and little lambes that have eſcaped from the Wolves, and from the deceitfull ſnares of this life, and therefore doe now keepe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall feaſt, each one in his place, all alike in joy, though different in degree. There Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity raigneth in her full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for unto them God is all in all, whom they behold without end, in whoſe love they bee all continually inflamed, whom they doe alwaies love, and in loving doe praiſe, and

Angels, and when ſhall be declared thy good workes, and what croſſes, tribulations, and injuries thou haſt ſuffered for Gods ſake. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. S. <hi>Luke</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, That when holy <hi>Tabitha,</hi> the great almes giver was dead, all the Widdowes and poore folke came about the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhewing unto him the garments which ſhee had given them: wherewith the Apoſtle being moved, made his prayer unto Almighty God for that ſo mercifull a woman, and by his prayers he raiſed her againe to life. Now what a gladneſſe will it be to thy ſoule, when in the middeſt of thoſe bleſſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits thou ſhalt bee placed, with remembrance of thy almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25597:19"/>
thy prayers and faſtings, the innocency of thy life, thy ſuffering of wrongs and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, thy patience in afflictions, thy temperance in diet, with all other vertues and good workes that thou haſt done in all thy life. O how great joy ſhalt thou receive at that time for all the good deeds that thou haſt wrought; how clearely then ſhalt thou underſtand the value and the excellencie of vertue. There the obedient man ſhall talke of victories; there vertue ſhall receive her reward, and the good honoured according to their merit. Moreover, vvhat a pleaſure vvill it bee unto thee, when thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelfe to bee in that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:25597:20"/>
ſure haven, and ſhalt looke back upon the courſe of thy naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which thou haſt ſailed here in this life: when thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the tempeſts wherein thou haſt beene toſſed, the ſtraits through which thou haſt paſſed, and the dangers of theeves and pyrats, from whom thou haſt eſcaped. There is the place where they ſhall ſing the ſong of the Prophet, which ſaith, <hi>Had it not beene that our Lord had beene mine helper, it could not be but my ſoule had gone into hell.</hi> Eſpecially, when from thence thou ſhalt behold ſo many ſins as are committed every houre in the world, ſo many ſoules as doe deſcend every day into hell, and how it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25597:20"/>
Almighty God, that among ſuch a multitude of damned perſons, thou ſhouldſt be of the number of his elect, and one of thoſe to whom he would grant ſuch exceeding great felicity and glory. Beſides all this, what a goodly ſight will it bee to ſee thoſe ſeats filled up, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie builded, and the wals of that noble <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> repaired againe? With what chearefull embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings ſhall the whole court of Heaven entertaine them, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them when they come loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the ſpoiles of their vanquiſhed enemies? There ſhall thoſe valiant men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men enter with triumph, which have together with the world conquered the weakeneſſe of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25597:21"/>
their owne fraile nature. There ſhall they enter which have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered martyrdome for Chriſts ſake, with double triumph over the fleſh and the world, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all coeleſtiall glory. There ſhall alſo daily enter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young men and children, which have vanquiſhed the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of their young yeares with diſcretion and vertue. Oh, how ſweet and ſavorie ſhall the fruit of vertue then be, although for a time before her roots ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very bitter: ſweete is the cold evening after the hot ſunnie day; ſweete is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the weary thirſtie tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer; ſweet is reſt and ſleepe to the tired ſervant: but much more ſweet is it to the Saints in

Heaven to enjoy peace after warre, ſecurity after perill, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſt after their paines and travels: for then are the warres at an end, then need they no more to goe all armed, both on the right ſide and on the left. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went forth armed towards the land of Promiſe, but after that the land was conquered, they laid downe their ſpeares, and caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their armour, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all feare and turmoile of warre, each one under the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his pavillion &amp; harbour enjoyed the fruit of their ſweete peace. Now may the watching Prophet come downe from his ſtanding, that did watch and fix his feete upon the place of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25597:22"/>
Sentinell: There is no more feare of invaſion by the terrible armies of the bloody enemies: there is no place for the ſubtill crafts of the lurking viper: there cannot arive the deadly ſight of the venomous Baſſeliske, nor yet ſhall the hiſſing of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Serpent be heard there, but onely the ſoft breathing ayre of the Holy Ghoſt; wherein is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden the glory of Almighty God. This is the region of all peace, the place of ſecurity, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated above all the Elements, whether the cloudes and ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie winds of the darke ayre cannot come.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Eradventure thou wilt now ſay, that all theſe things before rehearſed, bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments onely for the life to come: and that thou deſireſt to ſee ſomething in this preſent life, becauſe our mindes are wont to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very much with the ſight of things preſent. To ſatisfie
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25597:25"/>
thee herein, I will alſo explaine unto thee what may anſwer thy deſire. For although our Lord doe reſerve the beſt wine, and the delicate diſhes of moſt delight, untill the end of the banket, yet he ſuffereth not his friends to bee utterly deſtitute of meate and drinke in this tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous voyage: for hee knoweth very well, that they could not otherwiſe hold out in their journey. And therefore when he ſaid unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Feare not <hi>Abraham,</hi> for I am thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and thy reward ſhall be exceeding great: By theſe words he promiſed two things, the one for the time preſent, that was, to be his ſafeguard and defence in all ſuch things as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25597:25"/>
may happen in this life, and the other for the time to come, and that is, the reward of glory which is reſerved for the next life. But how great the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, and how many kinds of benefits and favours are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in included, no man is able to underſtand, but onely he, that hath with great diligence read the holy Scriptures, wherein no one thing is more often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſet forth, than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the favours, benefits, and priviledges, which Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God promiſeth unto his friends in this life. Hearken what <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in the third Chapter of his Proverbs, as touching this matter. <hi>Bleſſed is that man that findeth wiſedome,</hi>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:25597:26"/>
                           <hi>for it is better to have it, than all the treaſures of Silver and Gold, be they never ſo excellent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: and it is more worth than all the riches of the world, and whatſoever mans heart is able to deſire, is not comparable unto it. The length of daies are at her right hand, and riches and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie at her left. Her waies be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and all her paſſages bee quiet; ſhee is a tree of life to all thoſe that have obtained her; and hee that ſhall have her in continuall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion, ſhall bee bleſſed. Keepe therefore (O my ſonne) the lawes of Almighty God, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, for they ſhall be as life to thy ſoule, and ſweetneſſe to thy taſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then ſhalt theu walke ſafely in thy waies, and thy feet ſhall no</hi>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:25597:26"/>
                           <hi>finde any ſtumbling blockes. If thou ſleep, thou ſhalt have no cauſe to feare: and if thou take thy reſt, thy ſleepe ſhall bee quiet.</hi> This is the ſweetneſſe and quietneſſe of the way of the godly, but the waies of the wicked are farre different, as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth declare unto us. The paths and waies of the wicked (ſaith <hi>Eccleſiaſticus)</hi> are full of brambles, and at the end of their journey are prepared for them hell, darkneſſe, and paines. Doeſt thou thinke it then a good exchange, to forſake the waies of Almighty God, for the waies of the world, ſith there is ſo great difference betweene the one and the other, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end of the way, but alſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:25597:27"/>
in all the ſteps of the ſame? What madneſſe can be greater, than to chooſe one torment to gaine another by; rather than with one reſt to gaine another reſt? And that thou maiſt more clearely perceive the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this reſt, and what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of benefits are preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident thereunto, I beſeech thee hearken attentively even what Almighty God himſelfe hath promiſed by his Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> to the obſervers of his law, in a manner with theſe words, as divers interpreters doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them. When thou ſhalt doe (ſaith hee) ſuch and ſuch things, which I have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee to doe, there ſhall forthwith appeare unto thee
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25597:27"/>
the dawning of the cleare day (that is, the ſonne of juſtice) which ſhall drive away all the darkeneſſe of thy errours and miſeries, and then ſhalt thou begin to enjoy true and perfect ſalvation. Now theſe are the benefits which Almighty God hath promiſed to his ſervants. And albeit ſome of them bee for the time to come, yet are ſome of them to be preſently received in this life: as, that new light and ſhining from heaven; that ſafety and abundance of all good things; that aſſured confidence and truſt in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God; that divine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in all our Prayers and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions made unto him; that peace and tranquility of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25597:28"/>
that protection and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Almighty God. All theſe are the gracious gifts and favours which Almighty God hath promiſed to his ſervants in this life. They all are the works of his mercy, effects of his grace, teſtimonies of his love, and bleſſings, which he of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly providence extendeth.</p>
                        <p>To be ſhort, all theſe benefits doe the godly injoy both in this preſent life, and in the life to come: and of all theſe are the ungodly deprived, both in the one life, and in the other. Whereby thou maiſt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what difference there is betweene the one ſort and the other, ſeeing the one is ſo rich in graces, and the other ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25597:28"/>
poore and needy: For if thou ponder well Gods promiſed bleſſings, and conſider the ſtate and condition of the good and the wicked, thou ſhalt find, that the one ſort is highly in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Almighty God, and the other deepely in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: the one be his friends, and the other his enemies: the one be in light, and the other in darkeneſſe: the one doe enjoy the company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the other the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy pleaſures and delights of Swine: the one are truely free, and Lords over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the other are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bond-ſlaves unto Satan, and unto their owne luſts and appetites. The one are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25597:29"/>
with the witneſſe of a good conſcience, and the other (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they bee utterly blinded) are continually bitten with the worme of conſcience, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more gnawing on them: the one in tribulation, ſtand ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in their proper place; and the other, like light chaffe, are carried up and downe with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very blaſt of winde: the one ſtand ſecure and firme with the anker of hope, and the other are unſtable, and evermore yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the aſſaults of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: the prayers of the one are acceptable and liking unto God, and the prayers of the other are abhorred and accurſed: the death of the one is quiet, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and precious in the ſight
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25597:29"/>
of God, and the death of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is unquiet, painefull, and troubled with a thouſand frights and terrours: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the one live like children under the protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Almighty God, and ſleepe ſweetly under the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his paſtorall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and the other being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, wander abroad as ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſheepe, without their ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and Maſter, lying wide open to all the perills, dangers, and aſſaults of the world. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, that a vertuous life is accompanied with all theſe benefits, what is the cauſe that ſhould withdraw thee, and perſwade thee not to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:25597:30"/>
embrace ſuch a precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? what art thou able to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for excuſe of thy great negligence? To ſay that this is not true, it cannot be admitted, for ſo much as Gods word doth avouch the certaintie hereof. To ſay that theſe are but ſmall benefits, thou canſt not, for ſo much as they doe exceede all that mans heart can deſire. To ſay that thou art an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſelfe, and that thou doeſt not deſire theſe benefits, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, conſidering that a man is even naturally a friend to himſelfe, &amp; the will of man hath ever an eye to his owne benefit, which is the very object or mark that his deſire ſhooteth at. To ſay that thou haſt no underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:25597:30"/>
nor taſte of theſe benefits, it will not ſerve to diſcharge thine offence, forſomuch as thou haſt the faith and beleefe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though thou haſt not the taſte, for the taſte is loſt through ſinne, but not the faith: and the faith is a witneſſe more certaine, more ſecure, &amp; better to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, than all other experiences and witneſſes in the world. Why doeſt thou not then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit all other witneſſes with this one aſſured teſtimony? Why doeſt thou not rather give credit unto faith, than to thine owne opinion and judgement? O that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt make a reſolute determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſubmit thy ſelfe into the hands of Almighty God,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25597:31"/>
and to put thy whole truſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly in him How ſoone ſhouldeſt thou then ſee all theſe Propheſies fulfilled in thee: then ſhouldeſt thou ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of theſe divine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: then ſhouldeſt thou ſee how ſtarke blinde the lovers of this world are, that ſeeke not after this high treaſure: then ſhouldeſt thou ſee upon what good ground our Saviour invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us to this kind of life, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Come unto me all yee that travell, and are loaden, and I will refreſh you; take my yoake upon you, and you ſhall finde rest for your ſoules: for my yoake is ſweet, and my burden is light.</hi> Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God is no deceiver, nor falſe promiſer, neither yet is hee a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:25597:31"/>
great boaſter of ſuch things as he promiſeth. Why doſt thou then ſhrinke backe? why doſt thou refuſe peace and true qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe? why doſt thou refuſe the gentle offers and ſweet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of thy Paſtor? how dareſt thou deſpiſe and baniſh away vertue from thee, which hath ſuch prerogatives and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as theſe be: and withall, confirmed and ſigned even with the hand of Almighty God? The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> heard far leſſe things than theſe of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and yet ſhe travelled from the uttermoſt parts of the world, to try the truth of thoſe things that ſhe had heard. And why doeſt not thou then (hearing ſuch notable, yea, and ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:25597:32"/>
newes of vertue) adventure to take a little paines to try the truth and ſequell thereof? O deare Chriſtian brother, put thy truſt in Almighty God and in his Word, and commit thy ſelfe moſt boldly without all feare into his armes, and unlooſe from thy hands thoſe trifling knots that have hitherto decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee, and thou ſhalt finde, that the merits of vertue doe farre excell her fame: and that all which is ſpoken in praiſe of her, is nothing in compariſon of that which ſhe is indeed.</p>

How long wilt thou tarry, untill thou fully reſolve to doe it?

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25597:33"/>
even as looſely and diſſolutely, as if thou hadſt beene a meere Infidell, that had never any knowledge of Almighty God.

What appetite haſt thou left unexecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, notwithſtanding that thou didſt beleeve in Almighty God, and that thou wert a Chriſtian? What wouldſt thou have done
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25597:34"/>
more, if thou hadſt not had any faith at all? If thou hadſt not looked for any other life? If thou hadſt not feared the dreadfull day of judgement? What hath all thy former life beene, but a web of ſinnes, a ſinke of vices, a way full of brambles and thornes, and a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſobedience of God? with whom haſt thou hitherto lived, but onely with thine appetite, with thy fleſh, with thy pride, and with the goods and riches of this tranſitory world? Theſe have beene thy gods, theſe have beene thine idols whom thou haſt ſerved, and whoſe lawes thou haſt diligently obeyed. Make thine account with the Almighty God, with his lawes,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25597:34"/>
and with his obedience, and peradventure thou ſhalt finde, that thou haſt eſteemed him no more, than if he had beene a god of wood, or ſtone. For it is certaine, that there bee many Chriſtians, which beleeving that there is a God, are induced to ſinne with ſuch facility, as though they beleeved, that there were no God at all: and doe offend no whit the leſſe, though they beleeve that there is a God, then they would doe, if they beleeved there were none at all. What greater inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, what greater deſpight can bee done, than ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne his divine majeſtie? Finally, thou beleeving all ſuch things as Chriſts Church

And if the multitude of thy ſinnes paſt, and the faculty thou haſt uſed in committing of them, doe not make thee afraid, why doſt thou not feare at the leaſt the Majeſty and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of him, againſt whom thou haſt ſinned? Lift up thine eyes, and conſider the infinite greatneſſe and omnipotencie of the Lord, whom the powers of Heaven do adore, before whoſe Majeſty the whole compaſſe of the wide world lyeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; in whoſe preſence, all things created, are no more
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25597:35"/>
than chaffe carried away with the winde. Conſider alſo with thy ſelfe how unſeemely it is, that ſuch a vile worme as thou art, ſhould have audacity ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to offend and provoke the wrath of ſo great a Majeſty. Conſider the wonderfull and moſt terrible ſeverity of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and what horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hee hath uſed from time to time in the world againſt ſinne; and that not onely upon particular perſons, but alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cities, Nations, Kingdomes and Provinces, yea, upon the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall World: And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in earth, but alſo in Heaven; and not onely upon ſtrangers ſinners, but even upon his owne moſt innocent ſonne, our

ſweet Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, when he tooke upon him to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the debt that we owed. And if this ſeverity was uſed upon greene and innocent wood, and that for the ſinnes of others; what then will he doe upon dry and withered wood, and againſt thoſe that are loden with their owne ſinnes?

without remedy.

Conſider alſo the profoundneſſe of his deepe judgments, wherof we read, and ſee daily ſo great wonders. We ſee how <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe, after

his ſo great wiſdome, and after thoſe three thouſand parables and moſt profound myſteries uttered by him, was forſaken by Almighty God, and ſuffered to fall down and adore Idols.

We ſee daily many ſtarres fall downe from Heaven unto earth, with miſerable fals, and to wallow themſelves in the durt, and to eate the meate of ſwine, which ſate before at Gods owne table, and were fed with the very bread of Angels. If then the juſt and righteous

for ſome ſecret pride or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or elſe for ſome ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of theirs) be thus juſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of Almighty God, after they have beſtowed ſo many yeares in his ſervice. What maiſt thou looke for, that haſt done in a manner nothing elſe in all thy life time, but onely heaped ſinnes upon ſinnes, and haſt thereby offended Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God moſt grievouſly?</p>
                        <p>Now, if thou haſt lived after this ſort, were it not reaſon that thou ſhouldſt now at the length give over, and ceaſe heaping ſinne upon ſinne, and debt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on debt, and begin to pacifie the wrath of Almighty God, and to disburden thy ſinnefull ſoule? Were it not meet, that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25597:38"/>
that time which thou haſt hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto given to the world, to thy fleſh, and to the Divell, ſhould ſuffice? and that thou ſhouldeſt beſtow ſome little time of that which remaineth, to ſerve him, who hath given thee all that thou haſt? Were it not a point of wiſedome, after ſo long time, and ſo many great injuries, to feare the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible juſtice of Almighty God, who the more patiently he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth ſinners, the more hee doth afterwards puniſh them with ſeverity and juſtice? Were it not meet for thee to feare thy long continuance ſo many yeares in ſinne, and in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of Almighty God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing thereby againſt thee ſuch

Were it not meet to feare, leaſt that the force of evill cuſtome may in continuance of time be turned into nature; and that thy long vicious uſuall manner of committing ſinne, may make of a vice, a neceſſity, or little leſſe? Why art thou not afraid, leaſt by little and little thou maieſt caſt thy ſelfe downe head-long into the deep pit of a reprobate ſence, whereinto after that a man is once falne, hee never maketh account of any ſinne, be it never ſo great.</p>

O the manners of theſe times! <hi>O quantum eſt in rebus mane!</hi> O how great a nothing is there in all things! What a vanity of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity hath overſpread the age we live in? Were our forefathers now alive to be ſpectators of this vanity, it would ſtrike them into amazement. In their dayes the Pike, the Speare, the Sword, the Bowe, the Arrow, Musket and Caliever, with the warlike Horſe, were the object of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and recreation: Now the Pot, the Pipe, Dice and Cards, and ſuch like vanities, indeed worſe then the quinteſſence of the extreameſt vanity.

O vaine man that doſt thus forget thy God, and abuſe thy ſelfe! why doſt thou thus ſuffer thy ſelfe to be ſwallowed up in the gulfe of vanity, which hath no bottome but miſery? Why ſuffereſt thou the Divell thus to take thee on the hip, that he may caſt thee downe into the Abiſſe of hell? Art thou ſo bewitched with that which will

have an end, a ſudden end, a wretched end? Thy honey will prove Gall in the end, and thy Wine, Vinegar. In theſe faire roſes of vanity the Divell hides his pins, that ſhall pricke thee, when thou lookeſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with their ſweet ſmels. Theſe vanities we purchaſe at no eaſie rate; it is with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of puniſhment, and loſſe of happineſſe: As the bird that accepts of the Fowlers meat, buyes it full dearely, with the loſſe of her owne life: ſo when we accept theſe vanities from the Divell, it is with the loſſe of better things, in price a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the whole world.

the better for all thy dainties, more then the poore man that never taſted them? Nay, how much better in the day of triall, and at the houre of death? Then all thy pride, pompe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhall be turned into ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led deformity, &amp; irrecoverable calamity; then vanity ſhewes it ſelfe in the proper colours, then death, and knell, and hell doe all conſpire to aggravate thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; yea, then hell begins to come to thee before thou come to it; thy eyes ſleepe not, thy ſenſes reſt not, thy perplexed heart burnes within thee, thy wounded conſcience bleeds within thee; thou ſeeſt nothing but terror, thou feeleſt nothing but horror; thou thinkeſt thy

That ſaying of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man is then, if not before, verified: <hi>Suae quemque exagitant furiae;</hi> every man is tormented with his owne fury, which is his conſcience. Beſides thy wife, children, or other friends (to the exaſperating of thy griefe) doe ſtand about thee weeping, as loath to part from thee: whereas thy ſinnes follow thee, and will follow thee, doe what thou canſt; hell gapes before thee with a wide mouth as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devoure thee, deſtruction on both ſides attends thee: backe thou canſt not goe, for a

dead corps followes thee ſo neere that thou canſt not part from it, it is tied unto thee with an indiſſolveable knot; beſides, conſcience followes thee, and cries out againſt thee, and will not leave thee; continually it preſents thee with the dreadfull ſpectacle of thy dolefull and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinnes. If this were now ſeriouſly conſidered, how would it make thy heart to ake with grieving, thy eyes to ſwell with weeping, thy hands to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lifted up, thy knees ever bended? How wouldeſt thou ſtrive to ſubdue thy fleſh to the ſpirit, ſenſuality to reaſon, reaſon to faith, and faith to the ſervice of God? But thou doſt not now conſider this, that thy ſinne is ſo

faſt linkt to thy conſcience, that at the laſt (albeit not before) it will pull and hale thee, and rack and prick thy conſcience, which wil accuſe, convict, &amp; condemne thee: all thy vanities, all thy iniquities, will then purſue thee like ſo many furious ghoſts. Then <hi>ex ore tuo,</hi> out of thy own mouth ſhalt thou be judged, thou evill ſervant: thy owne mouth ſhall confeſſe that thou haſt followed nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: What a vanity was it for me to make earth my heaven, and ſo to admire and even adore this earth, that it is a hell to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it?

for ſuch perſons as bee rebels and tranſgreſſours of his Law. For although the hope of the rewards that are promiſed unto the good in the life to come, may move us very much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: yet are wee commonly more moved with things that be irkeſome unto us, than with ſuch as be pleaſant: even as we ſee by daily experience, that we are vexed more with an injury done unto us, than delighted with any honour; and we are more troubled with ſickneſſe, than comforted with health: and ſo by the diſcommodity of ſicknes, we come to underſtand the commodity of health, as by a thing ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceived, by how much
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:25597:72"/>
more it is ſenſibly felt. Now for this cauſe did our Lord in times paſt uſe this meane more than any other, as it appeareth moſt clearely by the writings of the Prophets, which are every where full of dreadfull ſayings and threatnings, wherewith our Lord pretendeth to put a terrour into the hearts of men, and ſo to bridle and ſubdue them under the obedience of his Law. And for this end he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> That hee ſhould take a white booke, and write in the ſame all the threatnings and calamities which hee had revealed unto him, even from the firſt day he began to mlke with him, untill that preſent houre, and that he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:25597:72"/>
ſhould read the ſame in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the people, to ſee if peradventure they would bee moved therewith unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to change their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, to the end, that hee might alſo change the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his wrath, which he had purpoſed to execute upon them. And the holy Scripture ſaith, That when the Prophet had done according as hee was commanded by almighty God, and had read all thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the preſence of the people, and of the Rulers; there aroſe ſuch a feare and terrour amongſt them, that they were all aſtoniſhed, and as it were beſtraughted of their wits, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in anothers face, for the

exceeding great fear which they had conceived of thoſe words. This was one of the principall means which Almighty God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with men in the time of the written Law, and ſo he did alſo in the time of the Law of graces in vvhich, the holy Apoſtle ſaith, That as there is revealed a juſtice, vvhereby God maketh men juſt, ſo is there alſo revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an indignation and vvrath, vvhereby he puniſheth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: for vvhich cauſe, S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> (the glorious forerunner of our Saviour Chriſt) was ſent vvith this commiſſion and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, to preach unto the world, <hi>That the axe was now put to the rooot of the tree, and that every tree that brought not forth</hi>

of the moſt horrible torments and paines that be in that curſed place.

This being true, what greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can there be, than that they which beleeve and confeſſe this for truth, ſhould live with ſuch moſt ſtrange negligence and careleſneſſe as they doe? What
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:25597:78"/>
travell and paines would not a man willingly take to eſcape even one onely day, yea, one houre, the very leaſt of theſe torments? and wherefore doe they not then, to eſcape the everlaſtingneſſe of ſo great paines and horrible torments, endure ſo little a travell, as to follow the exerciſe of vertue. Surely, the conſideration of this matter were able to make any ſinfull ſoule to feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in caſe it were deepely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                     <p>And if amongſt ſo great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of paines, there were any manner hope of end or releaſe, it would be ſome kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: but alas it is not ſo, for there the gates are faſt ſhut up from
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25597:78"/>
all expectation of any manner of eaſe or hope. In all kinde of paines and calamities that be in this world, there is alwaies ſome gap lying open, whereby the patient may receive ſome kinde of comfort: ſometimes reaſon, ſometimes the weather, ſometimes his friends, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the hearing that others are troubled with the very ſame diſeaſe, and ſometimes (at the leaſt) the hope of an end may cheare him: onely in theſe moſt horrible paines and miſeries that be in hell, all the waies are ſhut up in ſuch ſort, and all the havens of comfort ſo embarred, that the miſerable ſinner cannot hope for remedy on any ſide, neither of heaven, nor of earth,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:25597:79"/>
neither of the time paſt, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or of the time to come, or of any other meanes. The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoules thinke, that all men are ſhooting darts at them, and that all creatures have conſpired againſt them, and that even they themſelves are cruell againſt themſelves. This is that diſtreſſe whereof the ſinners doe lament by the Prophet, ſaying: <hi>The ſorrowes of hell have compaſſed me round about, and the ſnares of death have beſieged me:</hi> For on which ſide ſoever they looke or turne their eyes, they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually behold occaſions of ſorrow and griefe, and none at all of any eaſe or comfort. The wiſe Virgins (ſaith the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt) <hi>that ſtood ready prepared at</hi>

As if he had ſaid more plainely, the gate of pardon, of mercy, of comfort, of grace, of interceſſion, of hope, and of all other goodneſſe, is ſhut up for ever and ever. Six daies and no more was Manna to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, but the ſeventh day, which was the Sabbath day, was there none to bee found: and therefore ſhall he faſt for ever, that hath not in due time made his proviſion aforehand. The ſluggard (ſaith the Wiſe man) will not till his ground for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:25597:80"/>
feare of cold, and therefore ſhall he beg his bread in ſummer, and no man ſhall give him to eat. And in another place he ſaith: <hi>He that gathereth in ſummer, is a wiſe ſonne, but hee that giveth himſelfe to ſleeping at that ſeaſon, is the ſonne of confuſion.</hi> For what confuſion can be greater then that which that miſerable cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous rich man ſuffereth, who with a few crums of bread that fell from his table, might have purchaſed to himſelfe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of everlaſting felicity, and glory in the kingdome of Heaven? But becauſe he would not give ſo ſmall a thing, he came to ſuch an extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that he begged (yea, and ſhall for ever beg in vaine) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:25597:80"/>
one drop of water, and ſhall never obtaine it. Who is not moved with that requeſt of that unfortunate damned perſon, who cried, <hi>O father</hi> Abraham <hi>have compaſsion on me, and ſend downe</hi> Lazarus <hi>unto me, that hee may dip the tip of his finger in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and touch my tongue, for theſe horrible flames doe torment me exceedingly.</hi> What ſmaller requeſt could there be deſired than this? He durſt not requeſt ſo much as one cup of water, neither that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould put his whole hand into the water, nor yet (which is more to be wondered at) did he requeſt ſo much as the whole finger, but onely the tip of it, that it might but touch his tongue; and yet
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25597:81"/>
even this alone would not be granted unto him. Whereby thou maieſt perceive, how faſt the gate of all conſolation is ſhut up, and how univerſall that interdict and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is that is there laid upon the damned, ſith this rich Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton could not obtaine ſo much as this ſmall requeſt. So that whereſoever the damned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe turne their eyes, and on which ſide ſoever they ſtretch their hands, they ſhall not finde any manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, be it never ſo ſmall. And as he that is in the Sea choaked, and almoſt drowned under the water, not finding any ſtay whereupon to ſet his foot, ſtretcheth forth his hands often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:25597:81"/>
on every ſide in vaine (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that he graſpeth after, is thin and liquid water, which deceives him) even ſo ſhall it fare with the damned perſons, when they ſhall be drowned in that deepe Sea of ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, where they ſhall ſtrive and ſtruggle alwaies with death, without finding any ſuccour or place of ſtay, whereupon they may reſt themſelves. Now this is one of the greateſt paines wherewith they be tormented in that curſed place: for if theſe torments ſhould have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance limited but for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time, though it were for a thouſand, yea, a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand millions of yeares, yet even this would be ſome little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:25597:82"/>
unto them, for nothing is perfectly great, in caſe it have an end: But alas, they have not ſo much as this poore and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comfort: but contrariwiſe, their paines are equall in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance with the eternity of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and the laſting of their miſery with the eternity of Gods glory. As long as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God ſhall live, ſo long ſhall they die: and when Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God ſhall ceaſe to be God, then ſhall they alſo ceaſe to be as they are. O deadly life, O immortall death! I know not whether I may truely tearme thee, either life or death: for if thou be life, why doſt thou kill? And if thou be death, why doeſt thou endure? Wherefore
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:25597:82"/>
I will call thee neither the one, nor the other, for ſo much as in both of them there is contained ſomething that is good: as in life there is reſt, and in death there is an end (which is a great comfort to the afflicted) but thou haſt neither reſt nor end. What art thou then? Marry, thou art the worſt of life, and the worſt of death; for of death thou haſt the torment, without any end, and of life thou haſt the continuance without any reſt. O bitter compoſition, O unſavory purgation of our Lords cup! of the which, all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the earth ſhall drinke their part.</p>
                     <p>Now in this continuance in this eternity, I would wiſh that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:25597:83"/>
thou (my deare Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) wouldſt fixe the eyes of thy conſideration a little while: and that as the cleane beaſt cheweth the cud, even ſo thou wouldeſt weigh this point within thy ſelfe with great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration. And to the intent thou maieſt doe it the better, conſider a little the paines that a ſicke man abideth in one evill night, eſpecially if he be vexed with any vehement griefe, or ſharpe diſeaſe. Marke how oft he tumbleth and toſſeth in his bed, what diſquietneſſe he hath, how long and tedious one night ſeemeth unto him, how duely he counteth all the houres of the clocke, and how long hee deemeth each houre of them to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25597:83"/>
be, how he paſſeth the time in wiſhing for the dawning of the day, which notwithſtanding, is like to helpe him little towards the curing of his diſeaſe. If this then be accounted ſo great a torment, what torment ſhall that be (thinke you) in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting night in hell, which hath no morning, nor ſo much as any hope of any dawning of the day: O darkneſſe moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure! O night everlaſting! O night accurſed even by the mouth of Almighty God and all his Saints! That one ſhall wiſh for light, and ſhall never ſee it, neither ſhall the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the morning ariſe any more. Conſider then what a kinde of torment ſhall that bee,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25597:84"/>
to live everlaſtingly in ſuch a night as this is, lying not in a ſoft bed (as the ſicke man doth) but in a hot burning furnace, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out ſuch terrible raging flames. What ſhoulders ſhall be able to abide thoſe horrible heats. If it ſeeme to us as a thing intollerable to have onely ſome part of our feet ſtanding upon a pan of burning coales, for the ſpace of repeating the Lords prayer. What ſhall it be (thinke you) to ſtand body and ſoule burning in the midſt of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting hot raging fires in hell, in compariſon of which, the fires of this world are but painted fires. Is there any wit or judgement in this world? Have men their right ſences?
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25597:84"/>
doe they underſtand what theſe words import? or are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure perſwaded, that theſe are onely the fables of Poets? or doe they thinke, that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not to them, or elſe that it was onely ment for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? None of all this can they ſay, for ſo much as our faith aſſureth us moſt certainely herein. And our Saviour Chriſt himſelfe, who is everlaſting truth, crieth out in his Goſpell, ſaying, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall faile, but my word ſhall not faile.</hi>

                     <p>Of this miſery there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another as great as it, which is, that the paines are alwaies continuing in one like degree, without any manner of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or decreaſing. All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

A time there was, when with one cup of cold water I might have purchaſed to my ſelfe a crowne of glory, and when alſo with ſuch neceſſary workes of

mercy in relieving the poore, I might have gained life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. Wherefore did I not looke before me? How was I blinded with things preſent? How did J let paſſe the fruitfull yeares of abundance, and did not enrich my ſelfe? If J had beene brought up amongſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Pagans, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that there had beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but only to be borne, and to die, then might I have had ſome kinde of excuſe, and might have ſaid. I knew not what was commanded or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited me: but for ſo much as I have lived amongſt Chriſtians, and was my ſelfe one of them profeſſed, and held it for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of my beleefe, that the

houre ſhould come when I ſhould give up an account after what order I had ſpent my life: forſomuch alſo as it was daily cried out unto me by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall preaching and teaching of Gods Embaſſadours (whoſe advertiſements many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, made preparation in time, and laboured earneſtly for the proviſion of good workes:) foraſmuch I ſay as I made light of all theſe examples, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded my ſelfe very fondly, that Heaven was prepared for me, though I tooke no paines for it at all: what deſerve I that have thus led my life? O ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall furies, come and rent me in peeces, and devoure theſe my bowels, for ſo have I juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,

I have deſerved eternall famiſhment, ſeeing I would not provide for my ſelfe while I had time. I deſerve not to reape, becauſe I have not ſowne; I am worthy to be deſtitute, becauſe I have not laid up in ſtore; I deſerve that my requeſt ſhould now be denied me, ſith when the poore made requeſt unto me, I refuſed to releeve them: I have deſerved to ſigh and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo long as God ſhall be God; I have deſerved, that this worme of conſcience ſhall gnaw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

have gained, by forgoing that little which J would not forgoe. This is that immortall worme that ſhall never dye, but ſhall lye there everlaſtingly gnawing at the entrailes of the wicked, which is one of the moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paines that can poſſibly be imagined.</p>
                     <p>Peradventure thou art now perſwaded (good Reader) that there can be added no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, than hath beene ſaid: But ſurely the mighty arme of God wanteth not force to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe his enemies more &amp; more: for all theſe paines that are hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto rehearſed, are ſuch as doe appertaine generally to all the damned: but beſides theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall paines, there are alſo
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:25597:90"/>
other particular paines, which each one of the damned ſhall there ſuffer in divers ſorts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of his ſinne. And ſo according to this proportion, the haughty and proud ſhall there be abaſed and brought low to their great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. The covetous ſhall bee driven to great neceſſity. The glutton ſhall rage with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall hunger and thirſt. The lecherous ſhall burne in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame flames which they themſelves have enkindled. And thoſe that have al their life time hunted after their pleaſures and paſtimes, ſhall live there in continuall lamentation and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. But becauſe examples are of very great force to move our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:25597:91"/>
hearts, I will bring onely one for this purpoſe, wherby ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this matter may the better be perceived. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of a certaine holy man, that he ſaw the paines (in ſpirit) of a licentious and worldly man in this ſort. Firſt, he ſaw how the divels that were preſent at the houre of his death, when hee yeelded up his ghoſt, ſnatched away his ſoule with great rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and made a preſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Prince of darkeneſſe, who was then ſitting in a chaire of fire, expecting the comming of this preſent. Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that it was preſented before him, he aroſe up out of his ſeat, and ſaid unto the damned ſoule, that he would give him the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:25597:91"/>
of that honourable ſeat, becauſe he had been a man of honour, and was alwaies ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much affected to the ſame. Incontinently after that he was placed therein, crying and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting in that honourable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there appeared before him two other moſt ougly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and offered him a cup full of moſt bitter and ſtinking liquor, and made him to drinke and carouſe it up all perforce; ſaying, It is meet, ſithence thou haſt beene a lover of precious wines and bankets, that thou ſhouldeſt likewiſe prove of this our wine, whereof all we doe uſe to drinke in theſe parts.</p>
                     <p>Immediately after this there came other two, with two fiery
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:25597:92"/>
trumpets, and ſetting them at his eares, began to blow into them flames of fire, ſaying, This melody have we reſerved for thee, underſtanding that in the world thou waſt very much delighted with minſtrelcie and wanton ſongs: and ſodainly he eſpied other divels, loaden with vipers and ſerpents, the which they threw upon the breaſt and bellies of that miſerable ſinner, ſaying unto him, that for ſomuch as he had beene greatly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wanton embracings and lecherous luſts of women, he ſhould now ſolace himſelfe with theſe refreſhings, inſtead of thoſe licentious delights and pleaſures, which he had enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world. After this ſort
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:25597:92"/>
(as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith in the 47. Chapter) when the ſinner is puniſhed, there is given meaſure for meaſure, to the end, that in ſuch a great variety and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of puniſhments, the order and wiſedome of Gods juſtice, might the more manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                     <p>This viſion hath Almighty God ſhewed in ſpirit to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man for advertiſement and inſtruction, not that in hell theſe things are altogether ſo mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially done, but that by them we might underſtand in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the variety and multitude of the paines which bee there appointed for the damned. Whereof, I know not how ſome of the Pagans have had a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:25597:93"/>
certaine knowledge: for a <hi>Poet</hi> ſpeaking of this multitude of paines, affirmed, That although he had a hundred mouthes, and as many tongues, with a voice as ſtrong as Iron, yet were they not able onely to expreſſe the names of them. A Poet he was that ſpake this, but truely therin he ſpake more like a Prophet or an Evangeliſt than a Poet. Now then, if all this evill ſhall moſt aſſuredly come to paſſe, what man is he, that ſeeing all this ſo certainely with the eyes of his faith, will not turne over the leafe, and begin to provide for himſelfe againſt that time? Where is the judgement of men now become? Where is their wits? yea, where is at leaſt their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:25597:93"/>
ſelfe-love, which ſeeketh ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more for his owne profit, and is much afraid of any loſſe? May it be thought that men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come beaſts, that provide onely for the time preſent? Or have they peradventure ſo dimmed their eye-ſight, that they cannot looke before them? Hearken (ſaith <hi>Eſay)</hi> O yee deafe and ye blinde, open your eyes that you may ſee; Who is blinde but my ſervant? And who is deafe but wee, unto whom I have ſent my meſſengers? And who is blind, but he that ſuffereth himſelfe to be ſold for a ſlaue? Thou that ſeeſt ſo many things, wilt thou not ſuffer thy ſelfe to ſee this? Thou that haſt thine eares open, wilt thou not giue eare hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25597:94"/>
If thou beleeve not this, how art thou then a Chriſtian? If thou beleeve it, and doeſt not provide for it, how canſt thou be thought a reaſonable man? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, That this is the difference betweene opinion and imagination, that an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation alone is not ſufficient to cauſe a feare, but an opinion is a for if I doe imagine that a houſe may fall upon mee, it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> enough to make me afraid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe J beleeve or have an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it will be ſo indeed: fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> then it is ſufficient to make mee afraid. And hereof commeth the feare that murderers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have, by reaſon of the ſuſpition they conceive, that their enemies doe lye in wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:25597:94"/>
for them. If then the opinion and onely ſuſpition of danger is able to cauſe the greateſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to feare, how is it that the certainty and beleefe of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo great terrible miſeries which are farre more ſure than any opinion) doth not make thee to feare? If thou perceiveſt, that for theſe many yeares paſt thou haſt led a licentious and ſinfull life, and that at the laſt, according to preſent juſtice, thou art condemned to theſe horrible torments in hell: if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there appeare by probable conjecture, that there is no more likelihood of thy amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for enſuing years to come, than there was in thoſe already paſt, how happeneth it, that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

                  <p>Now, what other thing may we inferre of the premiſes, but briefly to conclude, That there is none other underſtanding, none other wiſedome, none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counſell in the world, but that ſetting aſide all the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and comberſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wayes of this life, wee follow that onely true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way, whereby true peace and everlaſting life is obtained.

Hereunto are we called by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by wiſedome, by law, by heaven, by earth, by hell, and by the life, death, juſtice, and mercy of Almighty God. Hereunto are we alſo very notably invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Holy Word, ſpoken by the mouth of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> in the ſixt Chapter, in this wiſe: My ſonne hearken to inſtruction even from the firſt yeares of thy youth, and in thy latter daies thou ſhalt enjoy the ſweet fruit of wiſedome: Approach unto it, as one that ploweth and ſoweth, and with patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the fruitfull increaſe which it ſhall yeeld unto thee. The paines that thou ſhalt take, ſhall bee but little, and the benefits that thou ſhalt ſpeedily enjoy,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:25597:104"/>
ſhall be great. My ſon hearken to my words, and neglect not this my counſell which I ſhall give thee, put thy feet willingly into her fetters, and thy necke into her chaines: bow downe thy ſhoulders, and carry her upon thee, and be not diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with her bonds: approach neere unto her with all thy heart, and follow her wayes with all thy ſtrength, ſeeke for her with all thy diligence, and ſhe will make her ſelfe knowne unto thee, and after that thou haſt found her, never forſake her: for by her ſhalt thou finde reſt in thy latter daies, and that which before did ſeeme ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto thee, will afterwards become very pleaſant.

Hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eccleſiaſticus.</hi> Whereby thou maieſt underſtand in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, how great the beauty, the delights, the liberty, and riches of true wiſedome are, which is vertue it ſelfe, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Almighty God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee doe intreate. But if all this be inſufficient to mollifie our ſtony hearts, lift up thine eyes, and fix thy thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to behold our omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent God in his mercy and love towards ſinners upon his dying croſſe, where he made full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25597:105"/>
for thy ſinnes. There ſhalt thou behold him in this forme: his feet nailed faſt, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thee; his armes ſpread abroad to receive thee, and his head bowing downe, to give thee, as to another prodigall ſonne, new kiſſes of peace and attonement. From thence hee calleth thee (if thou wouldeſt heare) with ſo many callings and cries as there be wounds in his whole body. Hearken thou therefore unto theſe voyces, and conſider well with thy ſelfe, that if his prayer be not heard that hearkeneth not unto the cries of the poore, how much leſſe ſhall he be heard, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe deafe to ſuch cries as theſe, being the moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

cryings of our loving Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and intended for our ſoules ſalvation. Who is he that hath not cauſe to reſolve himſelfe wholly into teares to weepe and bewaile his manifold offences? Who is he that can lament, and will not lament at this? unleſſe he be ſuch a one as ſeeth not, nor careth what great ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, waſte, and havocke he maketh of al the riches and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his ſoule.</p>

commiſſion, in thought, word or deed. The ſinnes of this day are enough to plunge us, ſoule and body, into the bottomleſſe gulfe of perdition. If thou ſhouldeſt ſtraightly mark them, what anſwer ſhall we be able to make thee, how ſhall wee dare to appeare in thy preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom all thy creatures feare and tremble? But thy mercy is above all thy workes; much more above all our works of ſinne. In the confidence of thy mercy we come unto thee, beſeeching thee in thy ſonne Chriſt to be reconciled with us, and to aſſure us hereof by the certificate of thine owne bleſſed ſpirit. Breake the ſtrength of ſin that would ſubdue us more

And becauſe the night is now upon us, and our bodies deſirous of quiet reſt, wee pray thee to take us into thy bleſſed tuition, and to refreſh our wearied bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:25597:115"/>
with comfortable ſleepe. Protect us and all that doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto us under the ſhadow of thy vings, defend us from all evill, both of ſinne and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: keepe us from ſecurity and careleſneſſe, from dulneſſe and drowſineſſe of ſpirit, from fire and robbery, from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan and all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, from all perils into which for our ſinnes wee might juſtly fall. Let the ſight of the bed minde us of that laſt bed, the grave, wherein wee are ſhortly to take up our lodging, we know not how ſoone. None of us here preſent can certainely tell, whether theſe eyes of ours once cloſed up, ſhall ever any more open againe in this world:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:25597:116"/>
therfore receive us, good Lord, receive us into the armes of thy mercy, unto thine Almighty protection wee bequeath our ſelves, ſoules and bodies, and all that we have: upon thy mercy alone wee caſt our ſelves both this preſent night and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Bee mercifull to thy whole Church, continue the flouriſhing ſtate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes wherin we live. Decreaſe in it the number of ſuperſtitious Papiſts and prophane Atheiſts, and increaſe in it the number of ſuch as unfainedly feare thee. Preſerve from all dangers and conſpiracies our religious King <hi>Charles,</hi> our gracious Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her children. Give them all ſuch

a meaſure of thy Spirit &amp; grace, that they may ſeeke to advance thy kingdome on earth, and at laſt be advanced to thine ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdome in Heaven. Endow the right Honourable of our Privie Counſell with all ſuch graces as may make them fit for ſo high a place. Stirre up Magiſtrates and men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to endeavour after the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of thine honour, and the benefiting of thy people. Make the Miniſters able and willing to diſcharge the duties of their weighty calling with diligence and conſcience; water their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with the dew of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that daily ſuch as belong unto life eternall may be added unto the Church. Comfort,

O comfort thine afflicted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whereſoever or howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled: ſweeten their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and ſeaſon their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes with the comforts of thy Spirit.
