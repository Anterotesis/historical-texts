            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

about 3000. men, is again gone abroad
this day to fight with the enemy, God
give them good successe. Yesterday they
burnt some Villages about seven miles off
that harboured the Rogues, and brought in
3000. Sheep, and 80. Cowes, with other
pillage: Our Ships being four snall ones,

            <head>A perfect Relation of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
in Ireland, from the beginning
thereof, till this present Ianuary.</head>
            <p>SInce the Irish Army in <hi>May</hi> last was disbanded,
(which was done with much reluctation of the
multitude, being very unwilling to lay down their
Arms,) and the Romish plot for civill Warres (and
bloody battell practised by the lurking Jesuits,
and their adherents, the Romanists in generall)
between our gracious Soveraign, and his Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
tooke none effect; and the opportunity and means of
taking away root and branch of the Protestants, both <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
and <hi>Scotish</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> was avoided. It is clear and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that this new way of Treason and Rebellion, was
by the disloyall and persidious Romanists, the Incendiaries
of all Christendome, at some frequent Conventicles and
meetings, principally at a Friary called <hi>Multifornam</hi> in
the County of <hi>Westmeath,</hi> where many hundreds of them
met and consulted for many daies together this last Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
(provision being brought in unto them by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey)
where they thus plotted, contrived, and put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
as followeth, <hi>videlicet.</hi> That on the 23. day of <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober</hi>
last, most of the Kings Forts and Castles throughout
the Realm, should be by select men set out and allotted to
every particular Fort and Castle to be by them surprized;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62785:4"/>
and the Governours and Keepers thereof slain, or kept
prisoners.</p>
            <p>Accordingly many Castles and Forts were then surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes;
the Surprizers under colour of neighbourhood and
friendship, inviting themselves to breakfast or dinners to
the Governors and keepers thereof, where themselves,
their Wives, Children, and Servants were robbed, spoiled,
and stripped of all their monies, plate, jewells, goods, corn,
Cartell, Housholdstuffe, and Apparell, and some slain or
hanged, and some kept prisoners, and barbarously handled.</p>
            <p>For surprisall of his Highnesse principall Castle and
City of <hi>Dublin;</hi> where the residence of this Princely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is, was allotted and assigned the Lord <hi>Macguire
Baron of Eneskelim,</hi> the two <hi>Macmoghans,</hi> and others. The
Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> to that purpose repaired to <hi>Dublin</hi> some
few daies before; and the <hi>Macmoghans,</hi> and the rest, the
two and twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> with intent to surprise the
Castle on the morrow at the opening of the Gates, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe the Draw-bridge, and to act their intended
tragicall massacre of the Protestants, on the twenty fourth
day of <hi>October</hi> being Sunday.</p>
            <p>To that purpose had they gathered together a multitude
of desperate savage barbarous fellowes out of their remote
Countries into <hi>Dublin:</hi> of whom (upon the discouery of
the conspiracie) the Lord <hi>Macguire,</hi> the <hi>Macmoghans,</hi>
and many others were apprehended and tooke the Castle
the same day; but not so early in the morning as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and are yet there in durance. And many hundreds
more were neere approaching to the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> on the
three and twentieth day of <hi>October;</hi> but upon the noise of
the discovery, Retreated.</p>
            <p>And moreover about foure hundred men having divers
Moneths lien on Shipboord in the Port of <hi>Dublin</hi> in two of
the best Ships furnished with Guns, frequenting that Port,
hired under pretence of transporting those foure hundred
men, being levied and Shipped by his Highnesse Letters of
Licence for <hi>Spain</hi> were upon the discovery neglected, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62785:4"/>
no further care taken for their transportation, or victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
But the Friar, one <hi>Mallun,</hi> that had been the cheife
agent in victualling, and for the pretended transportation
of those foure hundred men, hid himselfe from further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and inquiry; and the men were thereupon set
on shore.</p>
            <p>What the secret intended intended Plot was, as well
touching those foure hundred men, as also touching those
two armed Ships, the occurrences and consequence being
compared, I leave to the judicious to discern; many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes
being made against Articles of Charter-party, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Masters and Navigators of the sayd Ships from hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
saile when the winde served. Notwithstanding, it
pleased that Almighty and omniscient God, that hath been
alwayes propitious, benigne, and gracious to our gracious
King, in reseuing and delivering him; as also his gracious
Father of famous memory, and famous Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
their predecessor, from many malicious, wicked, and bloody
Romish designes; As the Queen from pistolls, poisons,
and poniards, and the Armado of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the year 1588.
King <hi>Iames,</hi> and our gracious King <hi>Charles</hi> from the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Treason,
and since, in bringing back our gracious
Soveraigne Lord, and King, out of the jawes of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
<hi>Rome;</hi> by defeating, and preventing the massacre of his
Majesties Royall Sister, and her Royall issue in <hi>Holland;</hi>
from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Armado, in the year 1639. overthrown by
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> without his losse or costs. From intestine
and civill wars between him and his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
laboured by that Arch-devill, Arch-juggler. So now by his
secret and mighty power and providence (as the manner of
discovery will make appeare) to prevent the imminent
ruine, and utter destruction and losse of the whole Realme
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his Highnesse people the Protestants, which
must have followed; if the Castle or <hi>Dublin,</hi> whereby all
his Highnesse stores and provisions of all manner of Arms,
Ammunition, and instruments for War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being then no small
quantity had been surprised. Yet the rest of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62785:5"/>
in most of the Counties throughout the the Realme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confident of the good successe of the Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> in
surprising the Castle, and City of <hi>Dublin.</hi> (And well they
might be confident thereof, for the good successe of the
Catholike cause was prayed for at their Masses;) went on
with th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir traiterous and bloudy resolutions; and the
neighbouring <hi>Irish</hi> in most Counties, slew the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>English;</hi> Debtors their Creditors Tenants their
Landlords, some Lords of lands their Tenants, Mortgagers
their Mortgagees, Servants their Masters, and severally
possessed themselves of their severall lands and goods,
Money, plate, jewels, apparell, housholdstuffe, corn, and
cattell, and thrust them, that they let live, out of doores
naked. Many great mens servants being <hi>Irish,</hi> ran away
from their Masters with their best Horses to the Rebels.
The Rebels further prosecuting their traitterous and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
designes, surprised every day more and more of his
Highnesse Forts, Castles, and Towns, partly by fraudulent
and treacherous insinuation, partly by force, partly by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of faire quarter to those his Highnesse Subjects, who
had upon the noise of the Rebellion betaken themselves
thereunto for safegard of themselves and their goods, that
upon rendition they should carry away bag and baggage.
Behold, all ye that passe by, and read this relation, how
these promises of quarter were performed!</p>
            <p>No sooner came his Majesties subjects out of those
Holds, but they were all, by the Rebells, stripped naked;
some bloodily wounded, even to death, but left alive
languishing; their bellies being ripped, and guts issuing,
cast upon dung-hils; some butchered and cut into gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets;
some men, some women hanged, yea many hanged,
or otherwise put to death by them, when they returned
from some skirmishes with lesse.</p>
            <p>No degree of Laity, or of, or belonging to the Clergy
spared; but Ladies, Gentlewomen, women great with
childe, yea, children, very infants and sucklings, as well as
men, all robb'd, and stripped naked, and exposed to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62785:5"/>
of winde and weather, in a cold winter season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
forced to lie on the cold earth in the fields, in their travell
towards <hi>Dublin;</hi> over whom, being driven together in
Herds and Flocks, the Salvages insulted, and upbraided
them, saying, Now are ye wilde Irish as well as we, and
ye may go to <hi>Dublin,</hi> if ye will; but ye will finde little suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
there, for we are sure the Castle and City are taken.
Whither thousands of them repairing from farre, being
fore smitten with hunger and cold before they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
many of them, after severall reliefs upon the high
way, having been thrice stripped by the unmercifull Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
(it is true) found but slender succour; for indeed it is
not there to be had, howsoever some particular men have
been very bountifull in their Alms and contribution.</p>
            <p>For the one halfe of the City and Suburbs are Papists,
and will not, or dare not relieve a Protestant for fear of
<hi>Romes</hi> curse, which is denounced against them, if they do
relieve. Of the other halfe two parts of three, are poore,
and not able to give; and halfe a third part are departed
with their estates into <hi>England</hi> for safety; insomuch as the
distressed poore robbed people dye there on heaps, as before
they did in the fields upon their travell.</p>
            <p>It is now little more than two moneths since this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
burst out, during within, and since which time the
Traitors and Rebels have so bestirred themselves, that
they have not left an Englishman subsisting in any part of

and <hi>Vlster;</hi> the first whereof is in part planted with
English, being the portion of the noble Earle of <hi>Corke,</hi> and
the last with <hi>Scots,</hi> being the portion of divers noble and
generous <hi>Scots</hi> (who have behaved themselves bravely, and
stoutly against the Rebels; as also some of the English
Chiefetains have, who (I doubt not) shall reape the due
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62785:6"/>
merit of their courage and valour;) and in some other few
fortified Towns, Castles, and Forts, able for a while to
defend themselves from the rage and fury of the multitude,
who have dared to stop up all the high-wayes and passages
from <hi>Dublin</hi> to remote parts, thereby to prevent all postage
of Letters, and messages from the State to any Town, City,
or County, Governour, Lievetenant, or Commander,
to lay ambushes for his Highnesse Forces, Men, Arms, and
Ammunition, and to surprise the Arms, and slay the men,
to rob and spoile all the English within two myles of the
City of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and to bring up their forces so neere, and
to skirmish with his Highnesse Forces, they having gotten
at least 3000, or 4000 Arms of his Majesties by force, or
fpraud, but most by treachery.</p>
            <p>They have dared above a whole moneth to besiege his
Majesties Towne of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> both by Sea and Land, the
same being but twenty miles remote from <hi>Dublin;</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as both Towns are already straightned for victuals:
<hi>Drogheda</hi> having had for all that time no market at all, and
<hi>Dublin</hi> a very slender and thin market; therein appeering
now scarcely either pound of fresh butter, or cheese, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,
<unclear>Goose</unclear>, Hen, Capon, Chick, Egge, or Pigge, or any
manner of Sea-foul; and little Fish; all which were wont
to be very plentifull, and at cheape rates. It is supposed
that most of the Fisher-men are become Rebels. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Corn, <unclear>Beife</unclear>, Mutton, Veale, and Porke are already
doubled to that they were at the b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> very deed the Rebels have surprised, or do detaine

almost in the whole Realm.</p>

               </gap> moneths space after the Treason
and Rebellion brake out; it seemed to be none other, but
such as was <unclear>plotted</unclear>, stirred, and enterprized only by some
Male-contented old <hi>Irish,</hi> against the English; whose An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
and themselves h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ss fled their Ancestors lands,
and Revenues, and the couse not Romish, and universall;
but it had been possible to have been conceived, that if the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62785:6"/>
Castle of <hi>Dublin</hi> had been surprised; the cause would have
proved not onely discontent for dis-inheritance, but the
Catholike Romish cause, a Kingdome, and a new Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
King.</p>
            <p>As soon as those of the vicinity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> Lords, knights
and Gentlemen of the <hi>Pale,</hi> the old English, had by their
cautelous insinuations, and protestations of loyalty and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to the King, and Crowne, soverally obtained from
the Right Honourable, the Lords, Justices, severall Arms
and Ammunition out of his Highnesse Store house, in his
Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> for their pretended private defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Rebels: and had afterwards declared themselves,
by laying aside those severall Arms and Ammunition toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for a publike offence against our Soveraigne Lord the
King, his Crowne and dignity, to be their confederates,
Then it apperred manifestly that the cause was not only
private discontent of some particular men, but Universall,
Romish, and devillish, even for a Kingdom. For what did,
or could the last Committee of Parliament crave of his
Highnesse for enlargement of their jurisdictions, immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and liberties, which was not liberally of his free Grace
granted. Let the whole World behold, and see the free
Grace, and bounty, of a Royall, Virtuous, and pious King;
and the disloyall ingratitude, and heathenish immanity, of
a persidious, and Rebellious people, who have so Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
requited his King-like clemency and benignity. For
they have not only destroyed, and made desolate his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in two moneths, which hath been fourty years im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
since the last civill Wars; but they have also rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him of his Rents, Revenues, and Customes, and part
of those Subsidies which themselves had helped to confirm
by Act of Parliament, and robbed, spoiled, and murthered
many of his Liege-people, which should, and would have
cheerfully payed those Subsidies. For they have destroyed
all Merchandize and Trade throughout the Realm, whereby
even many of themselves, and their impious faction, must
of necessity sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>er infinitely; millions of gold will not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62785:7"/>
countervail the dammage on all sides. One thing more in
particular, touching those of the Pale neer the City of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and the confines is worthy to be related, <hi>videlicet,</hi>
that when some of them had obtained Arms, and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
for 500. men, with pretence to resist the Rebels:
besides those a forementioned for their private defence, they
returned answer, that they could not levy so many men,
who would fight against the Rebels: and therefore they
would return the Arms, and Ammunition, and so did,
but not to the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> whence they received
them, but to the Town <hi>Droghedath,</hi> which is now besieged,
between which and <hi>Dublin,</hi> the some men now ly with an
Arm., expecting doubtlesse, shortly to have all those
Arms again.</p>
            <p>For the best of them, who appeared most in getting
forth chose Armes, have since refused to come in upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
they have joyned themselves with the Rebels,
they have taken the Kings Subjects prisoners, they have
again r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leased them, and given them passes from the Irish
Army, coloured with pretended authority in the Kings
Name, with their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wn names, and a Romish Priests, or
Fry<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs subscribed. Was not this a neat Romish trick? Let
all these conveyances, and occurrences be laid together,
and then let all the Princes, and Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> judge,
and censure, whether Religion can warrant such fraud,
and treachery, treason, and rebellion, robbery, spoil,
rapine, bloudy cruelty, and murders.</p>
            <p>The primitive persecutions were exquisite torments of
divers kindes full of tyranny, and cruelty; but they were
short, and made a speedy end of life; but this new found
way of persecution by cold, and hunger, much more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and exceedeth them all, because it is a long lingring,
and languishing torment, and so much the more cruell,
because exercised on women, yea women great with childe,
Infants, and Sucklings.</p>
            <p>These tyrants, and bloudy minded men, certainly are
not Kings, nor Governours; by what authority then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62785:7"/>
they such cruelty upon their fellow Subjects? What
can they say for themselves, if they should answer before
their King? If they pretend religion, though there be a
mulct of ninepence, each Sabbath upon every person of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
age absenting himself from Divine Service by a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Law enacted in the Realm, they cannot alledge that it
was put in execution, or that they had not freedom for their
Romish superstitions, which to endeavor to convince them
of by argument is but folly. For their pretended Catholike
cause, which already appeareth to be the mother of treason,
and rebellion, the sin of witchcraft, murder, and all other
abominations, and will shortly appear, even to themselves
to be the daughter of Antichrist, and Antichristianisme,
must by an inevitable div<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned cree, be convinced by fire,
and sword. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto
thy name give the glory, for thy loving mercy, and for thy
truths sake.</p>
            <p>For if the Lord himself had not been on our side, now
may we, that survive since the day of discovery of their
abominable treason, and rebellion, say, when they rose up
against us; they had swallowed us up quick, they were so
wrathfully displeased at us. Pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ised be the Lord, which hath
not given us over as a prey unto their teeth. The snare is
broken, and we are delivered. It may be collected that
King <hi>David,</hi> in these precedent words of his, prophecied of
these later times, and the Romish persecution. For how
were the snares broken, and we delivered, when there was
but tenne houres left unrun out from catching us in their
snare? Meerly hy the providence of God, as the many
formerly mentioned deliverances were. It appeareth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly,
that the conspiracy had been long in batching, and
contriving with true Romish secrecy. For the honest-man
<hi>Owen O-Connely,</hi> the discoverer being an Irish man, but a
Protestant (as he hath declared to divers of his familiar
friends) having observed by discourse among the Irish, that
there was some enterprize in hand prayed for, at their
Masses, in furtherance, and good successe of the Catholike
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62785:8"/>
cause, Although he had dissembled his Religion, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
their Masses in places remote from his habitation,
where he was not known, could never obtain a true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the particular, untill the very evening of the two
and twentieth day of <hi>October,</hi> when <hi>Hugh Mac-Moghan,</hi>
one of the conspirators, intending to expresse his love to
<hi>Owen O Connely,</hi> and to rescue him out of the approaching
danger, and to that end having invited him by Letters, and
an expresse Messenger to ride with him a long journey to
<hi>Dublin,</hi> upon earnest affairs, they with the rest being thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come; opening his minde to <hi>Owen,</hi> told him what
the enterprise was, <hi>videlicet,</hi> the surprizall of the Castle of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> and Massacre of the Protestants, and enjoyned
him secrecy, and fidelity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Owen</hi> could do no lesse for his own safeties sake, then
give consent, and promise fidelity, and secrecy. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he diswaded <hi>Hugh Mac-Moghan</hi> from the enterprize,
but did not prevail. For <hi>Hugh Mac-Moghan</hi> answered,
that it was too farre gone, he was so deepely engaged, that
he had vowed perseverance, or to that effect. If it be so,
replied <hi>Owen,</hi> let us go on, I will do my best, or to that
effect.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding his verball consent, the good man
moved with the fear of God, love of his King and Country,
and commiseration of his fellow Subjects, Christians, and
Protestants, whom he well saw, and knew were sure to be
lost, and ruined if the plot succeeded, wisely reserving to
himself his compunction of heart, and loyall affection,
kept company with the Traytors, and revelled with them
in Taverns, untill he had drunk too much; but in the end
watching his opportunity, slipt away, from them, into
one of the Lords Justices houses, and discovered unto the
Lord Justice the conspiracy; to which the Lord Justice
gave little credence at first, because he perceived that <hi>Owen</hi>
had d<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>k too much. But the vehemency, and importunity
of <hi>Owen,</hi> moved him to embrace, and take the information
to heart, and immediately it being then late in the night to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62785:8"/>
go to councell with his Peers, and to take course for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of that wicked, and damnable Treason, and for
apprehension of the conspirators, who were eight or nine
of them attached, within eight or nine houres after; a
little before the prefixed hour of their intended mischief,
and the Lord <hi>Macguire</hi> about the midst of the same day.</p>
            <p>For every particular of the manner of dise very, it is
not materiall to set out; <hi>Owen O Conn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> best can, and hath
already told his own tale.</p>
            <p>Herein is given only a brief touch of it, whereout may
be gathered, that the finger of God was in it, in framing
the heart of <hi>Hugh Mac Moghan</hi> towards <hi>Owen O Connely,</hi>
and to discover that to him in the very point of time, which
he had so busily, and industriously long sought alter.
Therefore let glory be given to God the principall disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer.</p>

no difference or amendment since my last; only, I thought meet
to write unto you a short relation of our late skirmish. On mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
night last, we sent out a Party of about 2000 foot, and 200
horse, to a Town called <hi>Swords,</hi> eight myles off; where they
came about six of the clocke next morning, and found the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
being a thousand men, Intrenched in the Town, on whom
they shot for the space of halfe an houre; and at last brake in
upon the Trenches, but found strong opposition. But our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or Party coming another may upon them, put them to flight;
and pursuing them about halfe a myle, reterned, plundered the
Town. Our new English Souldiers spared neither man, woman,
or childe therein, they got store of good booty; among which, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
400 Cowes, a great part whereof should that morning have
been killed for the Rogues breakefast, they expecting a supply:
Our men also tooke four Colours, and flew in the Towne and
pursuit 179 men, besides those the Enemy conveyed away du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the fight, on horsebacke, and otherwise, whose number or
quality is not yet known: The Town also was burnt, and great
store of Corn unthrashed. But alas! our victory is nothing, if
we consider the losse of a brave Spirit on our part, Sir <hi>Lorenzo
Cary,</hi> brother to the Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> who with three more were
killed in the fight on our part. Vntill we have a good supply we
