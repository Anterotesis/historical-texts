            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But by the way, to adde a word or two, for the better understanding <hi>of this my Relation:</hi> VVhereas you have heard of many <hi>Bishops</hi> in <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> it will not be impertinent to set downe what manner of men these Bishops in the <hi>Primative Church</hi> were: for some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> to be all one, (which was the Herefie of <hi>Aerius)</hi> and that they lived meanly upon Almes and Stipends.</p>
               <p>For the first, the Office of a Bishop is set downe by St. <hi>Paul, Titus</hi> the 1. and 5. <hi>For this cause I left thee in</hi> Crete, <hi>that thou shouldst set in order things that are wanting, and ordaine Elders in every</hi> City.

               <p>For the second, whereas some suppose that <hi>Bishops</hi> then lived upon almes or stipends, heare what <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> hath left written of his little <hi>Bishopricke of</hi>

As that they <hi>teach, simple Fornication to be no sinne, That it is no sinne to lend upon Vsury: That it is not necessary to make restitution of things uniustly taken away,</hi> with other things being meere slanders. <hi>Thomas a Iesu</hi> writeth, that one of the principall <note place="margin">Convers. omn.

               <p n="3">3 <hi>The Christians in Aegypt, Aethiopia, with the Iacobites in Syria,</hi> are accused to be infected with the <hi>Heresie of Eutyches,</hi> wheras they curse <hi>Eutyches for an Heretick, for confounding the two Natures of Christ.</hi> They affirme, <hi>The two Natures in Christ to be so united, that there is one personated Nature arising of two Natures, not personated without mixtion or confusion.</hi> As <hi>Thomas a Iesu,</hi> and others affirme.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They scandall also <hi>the Abassine Christians for using</hi> Circumcision: <hi>If you be circumcised, you are falne from Grace, and Christ profiteth you nothing;</hi> whereas they <hi>circumcise</hi> not for any <hi>Religion;</hi> but only it being an ancient custome of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians.</hi> They accuse them also of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme,</hi> For that they wash themselves yearly in the flouds, in memoriall <hi>of Christs Baptisme:</hi> As the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in memoriall of <hi>Saint Iohn Baptist:</hi>

And the like are the imputations laid upon other Churches.

               <p>A great Controversie arose among the Bishops in the west parts of the VVorld who should bee greatest. The <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> sitting in the Imperiall

               <p>The Maiesty of the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> for above 1000 yeares, which hath with stood <hi>Paganisme,</hi> and <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matisme:</hi> And of the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Moscho,</hi> and <hi>Trebizond,</hi> for some hundred of years.

The <hi>Greekes</hi> also charge the <hi>Latines</hi> with divers errours besides the challenging of the Supremacy, which they hold to be most grievous and intollerable: to teach all, &amp; to be taught of none, and <hi>Dictator-like</hi> to give Lawes to bind other Churches, yea, in things against their Consciences, as is their Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> of <hi>Image-Worship,</hi> abusing their <hi>Fasts,</hi> making no conscience to drink in them al day long: that they scarce reade the Sacred rules, <note place="margin">Irenaus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doginus. pag. 18.</note> and holy Scriptures; (saying) <hi>That the Popes Commandements, who for the time sitteth in the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>are their Canons and Lawes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they make no account of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29313:39"/>
yea that the Pope freeth them of <note place="margin">idem ibidem</note> all Periury, whensoever they intend to breake any bargaine or covenant made with any man.</p>
               <p>That the Pope and his Priestly traine remit slaughter, Periury, and all kind of crimes past, or to come; by which remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there is a gate opened to villany: And that which is most ridiculous, for the future time, they will remit to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined time of Moneths or Years, that the <hi>Latine</hi> Bishops are accessary to the death of Christian people, the Pope especially, who pronounceth the killer of Christians, such as resist the Papacy, blessed and happy.</p>
               <p>That they shut up by their Lawes all Priests and Deacons from marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and hold it an abhomination to receive the Sacrament from married Priests.</p>
               <p>That there are many Church Men among them, that commit whoredome, <note place="margin">Idem. p. 23.</note> and all kinde of uncleannesse most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely,

without punishment.</p>
               <p>They accuse the <hi>Latines</hi> of many more <hi>Errors,</hi> both in their Doctrine, as also in their manners; some of which you may finde in Cardinall <hi>Baronius Annalls. Tome 11 Anno Christi</hi> 1054. with some <note place="margin">Iren.

We may see their lamentable estate in the late Martyrdome of learned <hi>Cyril,</hi> late <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who had long and wisely governed that Church. And it seemeth that this his Crowne of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome was not to him unexpected: as appeareth by a clause of a letter, written by him to our late Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Name of Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>which we professe, and whose marks wee beare about in our Bodies, it is

a ioy to us to be afflicted and vexed. so also if it bee the Will of God, to abide the utmost extremity of their cruelty; that in the fiery tryall our Faith may shine more bright, and God receive the greater glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Church</hi> hath beene humbled (as before) but the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have exalted themselves, not onely above their follow <hi>Bishops,</hi> but also above their <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>Emperours,</hi> and the whole <hi>Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the third having obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Tyrant, <note place="margin">Anno. 606.</note> the glorious Title of <hi>Universall Bishop,</hi> by little and little the <hi>Bishops of Rome,</hi> subdued divers <hi>Bishopricks</hi> under them.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29313:40"/>
of their Authority.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Second, Leo Isaurus</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with warre in <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> it selfe being besieged by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liph,</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the second stirred up the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> against the said <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> who tooke <hi>Italy</hi> from him; of which the Pope hath a part, now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led St. <hi>Peters Patrimony,</hi> which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour could never againe recover: The <hi>Bishops of Rome</hi> dividing the Empire into the East and West, Pope <hi>Leo the third proclaimed Charles</hi> of <hi>France Emperour,</hi> about the yeare 881. And Pope <hi>Iohn the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,</hi> translated the Empire about the yeare 968, from the <hi>French</hi> to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus by little and little the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours waxed weaker, and the Popes stronger, untill the time of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the seventh,</hi> who founded (as <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine writeth) the Pontificall Empire.</hi> To this <note place="margin">Annal. li. 5. a. 447.

                  <note place="margin">Guichard. lib. 4.</note> written to the <hi>Emperours;</hi> as of Pope <hi>Leo the first</hi> to <hi>Martian: By all meanes wee are to bee obedient to your Piety, and most Religious Will:</hi> As also of <hi>Gregory the great</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:29313:41"/>
Thus they were for many hundred yeares subiect to the Emperours: but now they claime a <hi>superiority above Kings and Princes,</hi> and challenge to themselves <hi>plenitude of Iurisdiction, to take away, and to give Empires and Kingdoms at their pleasures, bringing the Emperours in subiection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> gave his Feet to kisse to <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour. <hi>Gregory the seventh</hi> compelled <hi>Henry the fourth</hi> to wait bare-footed at his Doore three daies and three nights, craving <hi>Absolution. Alexander the third</hi> set his feete upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Fredericks</hi> neck.</p>
               <p>And as they have lift up themselves over their fellow Bishops, and their Lords the Emperours, so also over the <hi>whole Church of God,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Above Generall Councells: A Generall Councell</hi> is the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative <hi>Church of God upon Earth:</hi> they claiming power to iudge &amp; controule all men, <hi>her selfe</hi> to be iudged of none: yea, to make new Articles of <hi>Faith.</hi> And as the <hi>Donatists</hi> falling from the unity of

the <hi>Church,</hi> fell also into this Hereticall Opinion, <hi>That the Catholicke Church of God was no where to be found, but in a corner of</hi> Africa, <hi>where they dwelt, and amongst them.</hi> So the <hi>Romanists</hi> affirme <hi>the Catholick Church of God</hi> to be onely in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Countries subiect to their Bishop. And therefore they tearme themselves <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> excluding all other <hi>Christians</hi> in the World out of the Catholike Church, and so Heaven, and putting them into the state of damnation, (though never so <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Pious)</hi> for not being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to their Bishop onely. Yet many of these Christians, by them so damned; suffer grievous persecutions for Iesus Christs sake; which they might quit themselves of, if they would renounce their Saviour; and also attaine great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and preferments.

               <p>By this their uncharitablenesse, doe not the <hi>Romish</hi> Catholicks cut themselves off from the unity of the Catholicke Church: As <hi>Firmilian</hi> writeth to St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> of Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> Excommunicating o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Cypr.

               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath exalted her selfe above all other <hi>Churches,</hi> so also the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are accused for devising, and adding some new Articles of <hi>Faith</hi> to the old ones, much advancing the state and profit of their Clergy which the other <hi>Christians</hi> will not, nor dare admit of, having received onely twelve from the holy Apostles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:29313:43"/>
As first, they have made the Popes <hi>Supremacy</hi> (before named) an Article of the Faith, <hi>(viz.) That their Bishop is head</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29313:49"/>
My Peace I give unto you; my Peace I leave with you.</hi> And for this cause, I humbly supplicate his <hi>Divine Maiesty,</hi> that he would incline the great <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome, Pope Urban,</hi> whom he hath endued with many gifts and graces; with the hearts of the Lord Cardinalls and Prelates of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they would submit themselves to retrograde from some of their <hi>new Canons,</hi> to the ancient <hi>Primative Canons</hi> of their Church. <hi>viz.</hi> That they would restore to the <hi>Church</hi> of God, of which they have cure, in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, <hi>The Cup, the symboll of our Lord Iesus Christs blood,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Lords holy institution, and practise of the ancient <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and of all the other <hi>Christian Churches</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>That they would suffer our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christs sheepe to <hi>drinke of the Waters of Life, (viz.)</hi> to have the use of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> in the Vulgar tongue, (from which they are now restrained)
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29313:49"/>
with their Service in their own tongue.</p>
               <p>That they would permit <hi>Marriage</hi> to all men, and represse Stewes and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel-houses, permitted by them, scande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous not onely to all the Christians in the VVorld; but also to them which are without: with some other like things; which may admit of reformation.</p>
               <p>And also, whereas some other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches pretend to abhorre Idolls, I wish from the bottome of my heart, that they would also abstaine from committing <hi>of Sacriledge.</hi> And whereas they cry out of permitting of Stewes and Brothel-houses in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> that they would be as zealous in not permitting oppressing <hi>Usury</hi> among them: both which are alike abhominable in the eyes of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Sweete Iesus! what should not a man doe? yea, what should he not suffer, to quench the fire of Contention in the Christian world!</p>
               <p>There was a time, when the <hi>Roman

Church</hi> did acknowledge her selfe a sister, and not a mistris.</p>
               <p>There was a time, when as, with an Harmonious concord, she suffered with the rest of her Sisters, even when as <hi>Arrianisme</hi> had in a manner overwhelmed the world.</p>
               <p>There was a time, when she gave her helping hand (as at the famous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells of <hi>Nice, Ephesus, Constantinople, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon)</hi> and did not rule after a <hi>Dictatory</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>Let none foster Schisme against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to maintaine themselves in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, wealth, and promotions, to the ruine of the <hi>Christian World.</hi>
