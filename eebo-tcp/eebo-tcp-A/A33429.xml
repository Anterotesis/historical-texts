            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER
OF A
London-Diurnall.</head>
            <p>A <hi>Diurnall</hi> is a puny Chronicle, scarce pin-feather'd with the
wings of time: It is an Historie in <hi>Sippets;</hi> the English <hi>Iliads</hi>
in a Nut-shell; the <hi>Apocryphall</hi> Parliaments book of <hi>Macca
bees</hi> in single sheets. It would tire a Welch-pedigree, to reckon
how many aps 'tis remov'd from an Annall: For it is of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract;
onely of the younger Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se, like a Shrimp to a Lobster
The <hi>originall sinner</hi> in this kind was Dutch; <hi>Galliobelgicus</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toplast;</hi>
and the <hi>moderne Mercuries</hi> but <hi>Hans-en-Kelders.</hi> The
Countesse of <hi>Zealand</hi> was brought to bed of an Almanack; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Children, as daies in the yeare. It may be the <hi>Legislative Lady</hi>
is of that Linage; so she spawnes the <hi>Diurnalls,</hi> and they at <hi>VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
take them in Adoption, by the names of <hi>Scoticus, Civicus,
Britanicus.</hi> In the Frontispice of the old <hi>Beldame-Diurnall,</hi> like
the Contents of the Chapter, sits the House of Commons judging
the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> You may call them the Kingdomes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy
before the weekly Kalender: For such is a <hi>Diurnall,</hi> the day
of the moneth, with what weather in the Common-wealth. 'Tis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the Pulse of the Body-Politique; and the Emperick-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of the Assembly, those spirituall <hi>Dragooners,</hi> thumbe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
Indeed it is a prity <hi>Synopsis;</hi> and those grave <hi>Rabbies</hi> (though
in point of <hi>Divinity)</hi> trade in no larger Authors. The Countrey-Carrier,
when he buyes it for their Vicar, miscalls it the <hi>Vrinall:</hi>
yet properly enough; For it casts the water of the State, ever since
it staled blood. It differs from an <hi>Aulicus,</hi> as the Devill and his
Exorcist; or as a black Witch doth from a white one, whose office
is to unravell her inchantments.</p>
            <p>It begins usually with an Ordinance, which is a Law still-borne,
dropt, before quickned by the Royall assent: 'Tis one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49320:3"/>
liaments by-blowes, (Acts only being legitimate) and hath no more
Syre, then a Spanish Gennet, that's begotten by the wind.</p>
            <p>Thus their <hi>Militia</hi> (like its Patron, <hi>Mars)</hi> is the issue onely of
the mother, without the concourse of Royall <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet Law it is, if they vote it, though in defiance of their <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls;</hi>
like the old <hi>Sexton,</hi> who swore his Clock went true, what
ever the Sun said to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Ingredient</hi> of a <hi>Diurnall</hi> is plots, horrible plots; which
with wonderfull Sagacity it hunts dry-foot, while they are yet in
their Causes, before <hi>Materia prima</hi> can put on her smock. How
many such fits of the Mother have troubled the Kingdome, and
(for all Sir <hi>VValter Earle</hi> looks like a Man-Midwife) not yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of so much as a Cushion? But Actors must have their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
And, since the Stages were voted downe, the onely Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
is at <hi>VVestminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suteable to their plots are their Informers; <hi>Skippers</hi> and <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;</hi>
Spaniells both for the Land and the VVater: <hi>Good conscion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
Intelligence! For, however <hi>Pym</hi>'s Bill may inflame the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the honest Vermyn have not so much for lying, as the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus a zealous Botcher in <hi>Morefields,</hi> while he was contriving
some <hi>Quirpo-cut</hi> of Church-Government, by the help of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
Eares, and the <hi>Otacousticon</hi> of the Spirit, discovered such a
plot, that <hi>Selden</hi> intends to combate Antiquity, and maintain it
was a Taylors Goose, that preserved the <hi>Capitol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is not once more all-to-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traytor'd
for dealing with the Lions, to settle the Commission of
Array in the Tower. It would do well to cramp the Articles Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
besides the opportunity of reforming those Beasts of the
Prerogative, and changing their prophaner names of <hi>Harry</hi> and
<hi>Charles,</hi> into <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Eleaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose a Corne-cutter, being to give little <hi>Isa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c</hi> a cast of his
Office, should fall to paring his Browes, mistaking the one end for
the other; because he branches at both. This would be a plot; and
the next <hi>Diurnall</hi> would furnish you with this Scale of Votes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved</hi> upon the Question, that this Act of the Corncutters was
an absolute Invasion of the Cities Charter, in the <hi>representative</hi>
Forehead of <hi>Isaac.</hi> Resolved, that the evill Councellours about
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49320:3"/>
the Corncutter are Popishly affected, and Enemies to the State. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that there be a publike Thanksgiving for the great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of <hi>Isaac's</hi> Brow-antlers; and a solemne Covenant drawn up,
to defie the Corn-cutter, and all his works.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Quixotes</hi> of this Age fight with the Windmills of their
own heads; quell Monsters of their own creation, make plots, and
then discover them; as who fitter to unkennell the Fox, then the
Tarryer, that is a part of him.</p>
            <p>In the third place march their Adventures; the <hi>Roundheads</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend,
the Rebels Romance; Stories of a larger size, then the Eares
of their Sect; able to strangle the Beliefe of a <hi>Soli-fidian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I'le present them in their order; and first, as a Whiffeler before
the show, enter <hi>Stamford,</hi> one that trod the Stage with the first,
travers'd his ground, made a legge and <hi>Exit.</hi> The Countrey-people
took him for one, that by Order of the Houses was to dance a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
through the West of <hi>England.</hi> Well, hee's a nimble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
set him but upon <hi>Bankes</hi> his Horse in a Saddle Rampant, and
it is a great question, which part of the Centaure shewes better
trickes.</p>
            <p>There was a Vote passing to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> it was cross'd by the Female-Committee,

their Children by the Tongues.</p>
            <p>This Cubit and an halfe of Commander, by the helpe of a <hi>Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
routed his enemies fifty miles off: 'tis strange you'l say, and yet
it is generally believed, he would as soon do it at that distance, as
nearer hand. Sure it was his Sword, for which the weap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n-salve
was invented: that so wounding and healing, like loving <hi>Correlates,</hi>
might both work at the same removes.</p>
            <p>But the squibbe is run to the end of the Rope. Rome, for the
<hi>Prodigy of Valour, Madam Atropos</hi> in breeches; <hi>Wallers</hi> Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errantry:
and, because every <hi>Mountibanke</hi> must have his <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him in <hi>Haslerigge,</hi> to set off his story: these two like <hi>Bell</hi> and the
<hi>Dragon,</hi> are alwaies worshipped in the same Chapter: they hunt
in their Couples, what one doth at the head, the other scores up at
the heele.</p>
            <p>Thus they kill a man over and over, as <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

murder the Psalmes, with another to the same; one chimes all in,
and then the other strikes up, as the Saints-Bell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49320:4"/>I wonder, for how many lives my Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Soule took the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ease of his Body.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mford</hi> slew him: then <hi>Waller</hi> out-killed that halfe a

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rre: and yet it is thought the sullen corps would scarce bleed,
were both these Man-slayers never so near it.</p>
            <p>The fame goes of a Dutch Heads-man, that he would do his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
with so much ease and dexterity, that the Head after execution
should stand still upon the shoulders: pray God Sir <hi>William</hi> be not
Probationer for the place. For, as if he had the like knack too, most
of those, whom the <hi>Diurnall</hi> hath slain for him, to us poore Mortals
seem untoucht.</p>
            <p>Thus these Artificers of Death can kill the man, without wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the body, like Lightning, that melts the Sword, and never sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
the Scabbard.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>William,</hi> whose Lady is the <hi>Conquerour;</hi> This is the
Cities <hi>Champion,</hi> and the <hi>Diurnalls Delight;</hi> he, that Cuckolds the
Generall in his Commission: for, he stalks with <hi>Essex,</hi> and shoots
under his belly, because his Oxcellency himself is not charged there.
Yet in all this triumph there is a whip and a bell; translate but the
Scene to <hi>Round-way-downe:</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re <hi>Hasleriggs</hi> Lobsters were turned
into Crabs, and crawl'd backwards; there poor Sir <hi>William</hi> ran to
his Lady for a use of consolation.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Diurnall</hi> is weary of the Arm of flesh, and now begins

This <hi>Cromwell</hi> is never so valorous, as when he is making Speeches

Gods in his own Countenance. If he deale with Men, it is
when he takes them napping in an old Monument: Then downe
goes dust and ashes: and the stoutest Cavalier is no better. Obrave
<hi>Oliver!</hi> Times Voyder, Sub-sizer to the Wormes; in whom Death,
that formerly devoured our Ancestors, now chewes the Cud: He
said Grace once, as if he would have fallen aboard with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
of <hi>Newcastle:</hi> Nay, and the <hi>Diurnall</hi> gave you his Bill of
Fare; But it proved but a running Banquet, as appeares by the
Story. Beleeve him as he whistles to his <hi>Cambridge Teeme</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee-men,
and he doth Wonders. But Holy men (like the <hi>Holy
language)</hi> must be read backwards. They ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Learning; and pull down Churches for Edification. But Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
is intailed upon him: There must be a <hi>Cromwell</hi> for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedralls,
as well as Abbeyes: A secure sinner, whose offence carries
its pardon in its mouth: For, how can he be hanged for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robbery,
which gives it selfe the benefit of the Clergie?</p>
            <p>But for all <hi>Cromwells</hi> Nose wears the Dominicall Letter, yet
compared with <hi>Manchester,</hi> he is but like the <hi>Vigills</hi> to an Holy-day.
This, this, is the man of God; so sanctified a Thunder-bolt, that
<hi>Burrowes</hi> in a proportionable blasphemy to his <hi>Lords of Hosts,</hi> would
stile him the <hi>Archangell,</hi> giving Battell to the Devill.</p>
            <p>Indeed, as the Angells, each of them makes a severall <hi>Species;</hi>
so every one of his Souldiers is a distinct Church. Had these Beasts
been to enter the Arke, it would have pazled <hi>Noah</hi> to have sorted
them into paires. If ever there were a rope of Sand, it was so many
Sects twisted into an Association.</p>
            <p>They agree in nothing, but that they are all <hi>Adamites</hi> in Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
It is the sign of a Coward, to <hi>winke,</hi> and <hi>fight;</hi> yet all
their Valour proceeds from their <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I wonder whence their Generals purity proceeds; it is not
by <hi>Traduction:</hi> if he was begotten Saint, it was by Equivocall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
for the Devill in the Father, is turn'd Monk in the Son; so
his godlinesse is of the same Parentage with good Lawes; both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of bad Manners; and would he alter the Scriptute, as he
hath attempted the Creed, he might vary the Text, and say to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
Thou art my <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is he, that hath put out one of the Kingdoms eyes, by clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our Mother-University, and (if the Scotch mist further prevaile)
will extinguish this other: He hath the like quarrell to both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49320:5"/>
both are strung with the same <hi>Optick Nerve, knowing Loyalty.</hi>
Barbarous Rebell! who will be revengd upon all Learning, because
his Treason is beyond the Mercy of the Book.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Diurnall</hi> as yet hath not talkt much of his Victories: but there
is the more behind: For the Knight must alwaies beat the Gyant;
That's resolv'd. If any thing fall out amisse, which cannot be smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
the <hi>Diurnall</hi> hath a help at Maw; It is but putting to Sea,
and taking a <hi>Danish Fleet;</hi> or brewing it with some successe out of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and it goes down merrily.</p>
            <p>There are more Puppets, that move by the Wyre of a <hi>Diurnall;</hi>
as <hi>Brereton</hi> and <hi>Gell;</hi> two of <hi>Mars</hi> his Petty-toes, such snivelling
Cowards, that it is a favour to call them so; was <hi>Brereton</hi> to fight
with his teeth, as in all other things he resembles the beast, he would
have odds of any man at the weapon; O hee's a terrible slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
at a Thanks-giving Dinner, had he been a <hi>Canniball</hi> to have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
those that he vanquish'd, his gut would have made him valiant.</p>
            <p>The greatest wonder is at <hi>Fairfax,</hi> how he comes to be a Babe of
Grace? Certainly it is not in his personall, but (as the <hi>State So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies</hi>
distinguish) in his Polotique Capacity; regenerated <hi>ab extra,</hi>
by the zeale of the House he sate in, as Chickens are hatcht at <hi>Grand
Cairo,</hi> by the adoption of an Oven.</p>
            <p>There is the <hi>Wood-Monger</hi> too, a feeble crutch to a declining cause,
a new Branch of the old <hi>Oake</hi> of <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I speak of Reformation, <hi>vous avez Fox,</hi> the Tinker; the
liveliest Embleme of it that may be; For what did this Parliament
ever go about to reforme, but Tinker-wise, in mending one hole
they made three.</p>
            <p>But I have not inke enough to cure all the Tetters and Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes
of the State.</p>
            <p>I will close up all thus. The Victories of the Rebels are like the
Magicall combate of <hi>Apuleius;</hi> who, thinking he had slain three of
his Enemies, found them at last, but a Triumvirate of Bladders.
Such, and so empty, are the Triumphs of a <hi>Diurnall:</hi> but so many
impostumated Fancies, so many Bladders of their own blowing.</p>

               <l>Rais'd to a Vicar of the Childrens threes;</l>

               <l>Fed on the Common of the femal charity,</l>

               <l>So shotten, that his soul, like to himselfe,</l>

               <l>Encount'ring with a Brother of the Cloth,</l>
               <l>Fell presently to Cudglels with the Oath.</l>
               <l>The Quarrel was a strange mis-shapen Monster,</l>

               <l>While <hi>Roger</hi> thus divides the Text, the other</l>

               <l>I never read on't, but I fasted twice,</l>

               <l>With that he swell'd, and fell upon the Theame,</l>

               <l>I Need no Muse to give my passion vent,</l>
               <l>He brewes his teares that studies to lament.</l>
               <l>Verse chymically weeps; that pious raine,</l>

               <l>Who ever sob'd in numbers? can a groane</l>

               <l>'Tis true; for common formall Elegies,</l>

               <l>There is no learning, but what teares surround,</l>
               <l>Like to <hi>Seths</hi> Pillars, in the deluge drown'd.</l>
