            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Bookseller TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Little <hi>Book</hi> was first Printed in the <hi>Year</hi> 1674. Who the Author of it was, I cannot tell, nor dare I presume to conjecture. When it came out first it was received as the last thing that was written by a <hi>Late Learned</hi> and <hi>Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Author,</hi> who was in <hi>France</hi> at that time, and since hath been cited, as if it had been his, and I was so carried away with the common Opinion, that I was almost perswaded to print it under his Name, especially having heard, that the <hi>Late Firebrand of the Nation,</hi> The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> always took it for his: But as I was ready to put it to the <hi>Press,</hi> a Gentleman, to whom I communicated my Design, did assure me he was not the <hi>Author</hi> of it, but another Person; but because I cannot speak upon Assurance, for
<pb facs="tcp:58249:3"/>
fear of mistake, I will not so much as hint to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom I think him to be. I was perswaded by a Learned Gentleman, as ignorant of the <hi>Author</hi> as myself, to give it a <hi>New Impression;</hi> and by this small <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> which came out so long since, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican Party</hi> might have seen, that there were good Men in the <hi>NATION,</hi> who would not sit idle, and see them run down the <hi>Government:</hi> For if a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> at such a distance did Ten years since defend the <hi>Succession,</hi> when it was but lightly attack'd, it was easie to foresee, that there would be great Numbers to defend it, both with their <hi>Pens</hi> and <hi>Swords,</hi> when it came to be so powerfully opposed. <hi>God Almighty</hi> be praised for giving the <hi>KING</hi> the <hi>Victory</hi> over the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and give his <hi>Loyal Subjects</hi> Grace to walk worthy of the same,</p>

            <head>A LETTER sent from beyond the <hi>Seas</hi> to a <hi>Noted Dissenter.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Cousin,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was very glad to receive your Letters, but very sorry to find by them, that you are still so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly desirous of <hi>Innovations</hi> in a <hi>Government</hi> so well Established, as that is under which you live. I perceive you are more zealous then it becomes a good Subject, or a good Christian to be, for carrying on a Project of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> as Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as New; <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Disabling a Papist to Inherit the Crown.</hi> For doubtless that proposal was first made, and afterwards promoted by him, the last <hi>Sessions</hi> of Parliament, not out of true Love to the Reformed Religion, but out of <hi>Spite</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> to the D. of <hi>Y</hi>—Who, were he not only Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, but Heathen or Mahumetan (which I think is not much worse) would certainly have as good a Title to his Crown, and all his Temporal <hi>Rights,</hi> as if he were the most Orthodox and Holy Christian in the World. And I am perswaded, that my zealous Lord <hi>Chose</hi> would not be willing that the King and Parliament should make a particular Act, to disable his own Posterity, to Inherit the great Estate he hath got, if they should turn Papists or <hi>Atheists,</hi> as others have done before them. We all know what mischief in the World, that Damnable Doctrine has made, <hi>That Temporal Rights and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances depend upon Saintship and Grace.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58249:4"/>
And if it be clear from <hi>Scripture</hi> (as nothing is more clear) that a King ought not to lose his Crown, for not being a Christian, or for renouncing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Religion</hi> as <hi>Iulian</hi> did; then it is plain, that neither the Duke nor any other <hi>Prince</hi> ought to be debarred from the Crown, which is the greatest and most sacred of Temporal Rights, for not being Protestants; or which is more, for renouncing the Christian <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am heartily glad, that God gave the Fathers of the English Church the Grace and Courage to defend her Doctrine, in opposing that Unreasonable, and truly <hi>Romish</hi> Proposal of my Lord <hi>Chose;</hi> which if they had approved, and defended after it was proposed, they had truly acted in that like Prelats Popishly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and really shewed themselves to be what their Adversaries would fain perswade the World, they are. For 'tis the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which maintain, <hi>That Kings Excommunicated, or Heretick Kings, or</hi> (which is all one) <hi>that Kings that renounce the Apostolick Faith, ought to be Deprived and Deposed.</hi> But 'tis the Church of <hi>England</hi> that maintains the contradiction of that Unscriptural, Unevangelical <hi>Principle;</hi> and thinks her self as much obliged to submit her self to a <hi>Heathen, Atheistical, Heretical,</hi> or <hi>Popish Prince,</hi> where she can, as to an Orthodox King; and where she cannot, she thinks her self obliged to suffer, as her <hi>Saviour,</hi> like a Lamb brought to the slaughter; and dares pretend to take up no Arms but those of the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (<hi>Whose true Copy she is</hi>) Tears, Arguments</hi> and <hi>Prayers.</hi> I say, it is the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58249:4"/>
that is of this Judgment, and neither the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the Kirk of <hi>Scotland;</hi> both of which have actually <hi>Excommunicated</hi> and <hi>Deposed Lawful</hi> and <hi>Rightful Princes,</hi> under the Notion of being <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> to Christs Kingdom; forgetting both alike the <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> on which the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath grounded the contrary Doctrine, as well as on right reason.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, though God rendred unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Caesar</hi> the things that were <hi>Caesar's;</hi> he owned his right to the Empire, both by word and deed, although he were but the adopted Successor of the greatest Usurper that ever was in the World. Nay furthermore, he owned and submitted to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatory Power of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who acted but by Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Emperour <hi>Tiberius;</hi> who (if there be any truth in the Character of <hi>Tacitus</hi>) was one of the greatest Tyrants, and most wicked men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the World saw. And as for St. <hi>Paul,</hi> there is no <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> not even that, <hi>that Iesus Christ is the Son of God,</hi> more clear in his Epistles, than that <hi>Every Soul should be subject to the Higher Powers; that we should Obey, not only for Wrath, but Conscience sake; that whosoever resisteth, receiveth to himself Damnation;</hi> and lastly, <hi>that all the Powers</hi> (and when he wrote there were none but <hi>Heathen Powers</hi>) <hi>were ordained of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here insist upon the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> as it is represented in their <hi>Acts,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Submission</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> as they are reported by the <hi>Ecclesiastical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58249:5"/>
and <hi>Historians;</hi> but the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to demonstrate the truth of this <hi>Argument,</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> has not only establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her Doctrine, but her Fathers and Sons of late, maintained in their <hi>Practices:</hi> and which the Kirk of of <hi>Scotland</hi> (agreeing in this and many other <hi>Points</hi> with that of <hi>Rome</hi>) did ever oppose, both in Word and Deed. And since that Kirk and Nation have been of this Opinion, we need not wonder that the <hi>English Disciples</hi> of their <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> have practised those rebellious <hi>Principles,</hi> which have so debauched and corrupted the Subjects of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as to make them be proverbially called, <hi>The Kings of Devils:</hi> And which the <hi>Anababtists</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> improved into this Maxim, <hi>That Saintship was the Foundation of Soveraignty, and that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ought to Inherit the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And furthermore, if Crowns ought to descend upon Protestants only, then it is but just, that the <hi>Estates</hi> of all Subjects whatsoever should be so <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed:</hi> and if for example, the <hi>D</hi>—of <hi>Y</hi>—must be cut off from his <hi>Rights,</hi> for being a <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> then let the rest of the Papists lose theirs; they are all alike <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and let them all alike suffer. And, to bring the Case to your own <hi>House,</hi> can you imagine that you your self ought to lose your <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Estate</hi> you have, or may have hereafter, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that supposition, that you should turn Papist; which men as firmly resolved against it as you have certainly done. These Practises and Proposals are such, that they have left a blot on the memories of some men, that seem more zealous than their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58249:5"/>
And I am glad at present, that the <hi>Religious</hi> Lord <hi>Chose</hi> is the Chief <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Promoter</hi> of such an Unreasonable and <hi>Romish Design.</hi> It is unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exclude a Popish Heir from a Crown, to which he derives his right from <hi>Popish</hi> Ancestors, and I have more than ordinary reason to call it Romish, because I have heard it maintained here among all the Priests I converse with. It is a Doctrine dearly beloved by the <hi>Romanists:</hi> And put but the Name of Heretick to a Prince here, and it is just the same case, as when you call a Prince a <hi>Papist</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> where, if there be no more than my good Lord <hi>Chose</hi> that are Fautors of this <hi>Romish Doctrine,</hi> my Country is in a far better case than I thought it to be. And truly this noble <hi>Project</hi> of the late Lord <hi>Chose</hi> was condemned by all <hi>Protestants</hi> as soon as it took air in <hi>France;</hi> not only for that it was an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gospel way of <hi>Proceeding,</hi> and savours strongly of the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they abhor; but because it puts their King in mind of a <hi>Project</hi> he is very much inclined to, <hi>viz.</hi> To make a like <hi>Law</hi> here, that none but a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> shall ever be King, or bear any <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Trust</hi> in the Kingdom. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if it should ever please God, for our sins, to suffer our <hi>Princes</hi> to backslide into <hi>Romish Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> we have nothing to do, but to pray, and like our Glorious Ancestors in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> days, suffer quietly, when we cannot flie. And therefore I wonder that you would so obliquely reflect upon the Bishops, and censure them for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which in Honour and Duty, they were bound to do, and represent this to their <hi>Disgrace,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58249:6"/>
which all good and well advised <hi>Protestan's</hi> must needs Command them for, if they will be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial.</p>
            <p>But put the case such an Act were made, who can see the bad consequences thereof? The Union of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> will be broke upon it, and War en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon both Kingdoms, and by the same reason, that none but a <hi>Protestant</hi> shall succeed now, Faction still increasing, none perhaps within a while, will be thought fit to Inherit the Crown, but a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> &amp;c. For you that are used to talk of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Strength,</hi> can best tell how Numerous and Powerful they are that are possessed with as firm a prejudice against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self; denying Communion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with both; and who educate their Children in perfect hatred of the one, as the genuine Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the other.</p>
            <p>I have wrote all this to present to your view what (perhaps in the hurry of Zeal) you have not had time to consider. And though I think it very impious and unreasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to debar any such Prince from the Crown, upon this account, yet could we imagine the Government were to be formed again, I would be as Zeal us for this condition, as the greatest <hi>Zealot</hi> of them all: And I am as sorry as any other good Protestant, that it was not always one of the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> though now it be too late to make it such.</p>
            <p>You tell me also that my Lord—intends to come and live in <hi>London;</hi> I suppose it may be under pretence to secure his Person from the <hi>Papists;</hi> but I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58249:6"/>
wish it may not be with a design to act over the same things, under a pretence of securing the <hi>Protestant,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> acted in <hi>Paris,</hi> under a seeming Zeal to secure the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion. The Reason that makes me fear it, is the conformity of our times in <hi>England</hi> with those in <hi>France,</hi> as you may see by the following account.</p>
            <p>The Duke, who was a man of an <hi>High Spirit,</hi> and not able to bear the least disgrace, being remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Henry</hi> III. from the most Rich and Honourable of his <hi>Court-Preferments,</hi> became thereupon Male-content; and retiring from the Court, which he now did hate, went to live at his <hi>House</hi> in <hi>Paris:</hi> where, by many Arts, as in particular by the subtle Practises of the Priests and Jesuits, he became in a short time the Minion of the People; whose Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he drew off from the King, by representing him (though a hearty <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>) as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorer of the <hi>Hereticks;</hi> who under the protection of the Princes of the Bloud increased mightily in his <hi>Reign.</hi> He also represented him in particular to be a great favourer of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> against whom he himself had a particular ill will; and whom the <hi>People,</hi> through the Instigation of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits,</hi> did perfectly hate, because he was a <hi>Protestant;</hi> although he was <hi>Primier Prince</hi> of the Blood (for whom the French commonly have a great Reverence) and by Consequence Heir Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or as a Friend of yours would have said, <hi>Heir Presumptive</hi> (for the King had no Child to Inherit) to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> After he had thus made the credulous <hi>People,</hi> by the help of the <hi>Priests</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58249:7"/>
               <hi>Iesuits,</hi> zealous for the Defence of their Declining Religion, he drew them to League into Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their lawful Soveraign, under a pretence of securing the same, by removing Evil Councellors from his <hi>Person,</hi> and obliging him to employ his Royal <hi>Power</hi> in suppressing the <hi>Protestants;</hi> and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular by declaring the <hi>Heretick</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>H.</hi> IV.) uncapable of succeeding to the Crown.</p>
            <p>For the sake of <hi>Peace</hi> the King was willing so far to deny himself as to grant the two first, but could never be made so false to the Interest of the Royal Family, as to consent to the last, by chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of Succession to the Crown, by which his Ancestors had Reigned so many hundred years; and which have been so long established, without any respect to Religion, by the Salique or Original Laws of <hi>France. Hereupon</hi> the <hi>League</hi> (in Imitation, and after the Pattern of which the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> was formed) or Rebellion grew so high, as to beat the King out of <hi>Paris;</hi> where the <hi>Guisards</hi> had a design to sieze upon his sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, shut him up, like King <hi>Chilperick,</hi> in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and set up the silly old Cardinal <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the King of <hi>Navar</hi>'s Uncle, to Reign in his stead. But the King escaping from <hi>Paris,</hi> sheltered himself in <hi>Chartres;</hi> where to compose Differences, he issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out Writs to call together the three Estates (which much resemble our <hi>Parliaments</hi>) at <hi>Blois.</hi> Thither the Deputies or Members repair, some for the King, but far more for the Cursed League; and therefore the <hi>Guisards</hi> finding themselves more potent than the <hi>Royalists,</hi> insisted almost on nothing else, but
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58249:7"/>
securing the <hi>Roman Catholick Religion,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> because an <hi>Heretick,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Succeeding to the most Christian Crown.</p>
            <p>You see Cousin, what a Parallel there is between those times and ours; excepting First, that there are no Priests and Jesuits to second such a Design in <hi>England,</hi> as there were in <hi>France:</hi> But to supply that Defect, there may be found men as fit in all points as they in <hi>Black,</hi> to stir up the People to Discontent and Rebellion. I mean the same sort of Persons that Preached up the late Bloody War; who really are the Bastard-brood of the Monastick and Jesuitical Emissaries, though they bear not the Names of their Fathers; but (like Bastards) are disowned by those that begot them. The Seditious <hi>Principles Preached</hi> and <hi>Printed</hi> by them in the late Times, are Evident Proofs of what Race they are come: And as a man may Travel so far West, till at last he come to the same Eastern Point from which he did set out, so you Cousin, and your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have gone so far from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that you are (some I believe unawares) come thither again; as is unanswerably proved by <hi>Lysimachus Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canor,</hi> lately reprinted at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in his Letter of Congratulation to the Kirk. But Secondly, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> fails in this too, That his Royal Highness is not a declared <hi>Papist,</hi> as the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was a declared <hi>Protestant;</hi> nor has yet openly renounced the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for which his blessed Father died a Martyr. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the two, our English <hi>Guisards</hi> are much more to blame, in representing his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58249:8"/>
as a <hi>Papist,</hi> which is so difficult to imagine him <hi>Strictly</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>But furthermore, upon supposition he were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Papist,</hi> the <hi>Proposal</hi> of my Lord <hi>Chose</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous, since it did suppose a possibility of prevailing with his Majesty to Disinherit his Royal Brother, who must needs be so much dearer to him, than the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was to <hi>Henry</hi> III. as he is nearer in Blood. And for my own part, I cannot but imagine at this distance, that his Majesty who is a <hi>Prince</hi> incomparably wiser and juster then was <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> must needs disdain and abhor such a <hi>Proposal;</hi> which, were it Enacted, it would enervate the Laws of Succession by which <hi>He</hi> and <hi>His Ancestors</hi> have hitherto Reigned, and give a greater Blow to the English <hi>Monarchy,</hi> than that which cut off <hi>His</hi> Royal Fathers <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here forborn to give you an Account of the Tragical End of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> which is a Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son well worth your Learning, and may teach all <hi>Persons,</hi> so disposed as he was, how unsafe it is to provoke Soveraign <hi>Authority;</hi> since the goodness of the best of Kings, like the infinite Goodness of God himself, whose <hi>Ministers</hi> they are, may at length be so injured and affronted, as to be forced to shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it self into Sovereign Vengeance and Justice. <hi>And</hi> therefore Cousin, let me advise you, if not for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, yet for Wraths sake, to have nothing to do in Blowing up the Flames of Sedition: Nor let your <hi>Soul</hi> enter into the secret of my Lord—though his <hi>Interest</hi> among the Senators (as you write) be so very considerable and strong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58249:8"/>You likewise forget your self, in miscalling the Execution of the late Laws by the odious name of <hi>Persecution;</hi> which if you can prove to be such, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptural notion of Persecution, <hi>viz. Infliction of Evil for Righteousness sake,</hi> then will I become your Proselyte, and forsake the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as much as I have this Idolatrous Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For no man is persecuted, but either for immediate matters of Divine Worship, which concern the First Table; or with respect to matters of Morality, or a Good Life, which concern the Second.</p>
            <p>With respect to the First; a man is persecuted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on a negative account, for not worshiping a False God, as the three Children in <hi>Daniel;</hi> or for not worshipping the True in a False way: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles were persecuted by the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, for not worshipping the True God according to the Jewish manner after it was abrogated: Or as our Fore fathers in <hi>England,</hi> For not worshiping God and our Saviour after the Romish Rites. Or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, on a positive account, For worshipping the true God in a way that is true; or to express it yet more clearly and absolutely in your own terms, <hi>For serving of God:</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> was cast into the Lyons Den, for praying to God against the King's Decree.</p>
            <p>With respect to the Second; A man is also perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on a negative account, For not doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which is in its own nature, or by Gods posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive command, morally evil: as the good Midwives were afraid to be persecuted by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58249:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
murthering the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Infants. Or else on a positive account, for doing some good moral action, which ought in such and such circumstances to be done: and thus was our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> persecuted, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the eyes of the blind man, and for healing on the <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these distinctions being premised, tell me <hi>in which of these cases you are Persecuted?</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>for what you are Confessors and Martyrs?</hi> For no man is persecuted, but as he is persecuted he is a Confessor or Martyr; and by his sufferings bears witness to the Truth. With respect to the <hi>Second</hi> head, you cannot say that you are persecuted; and therefore let me see whether you are so with respect to the first. And First, 'tis plain that you do suffer for not worshiping a false God; and 'tis likewise as plain, that you do not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for not worshipping the true God in a false way. For first, the Laws, whose Execution you mis-call Persecution, do not punish you for not worshiping God after our way; or if they did to prove their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution to be Persecution, you must First prove that the Church of <hi>England</hi> (whose Doctrine is down right against Idolatry and Superstition) does worship God in an Idolatrous and Superstitious manner; which, good Cousin, you know can never be proved.</p>
            <p>There remains nothing then but to assert, That you are punished <hi>for serving God, or for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God in a way which you are sure is true.</hi> That you worship God in a true way, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, and could heartily joyn with you in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstances. But then you are not punished
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58249:9"/>
for worshipping God in that manner; for the same Laws you complain of, allow you to worship God in what fashion you please; and not only you, but your Family, be it as great as it will; and lastly, not only your Family, but Five Persons more; Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, were you the only Christians in the World, and the Magistrates Heathens; or, which your Friends are more likely to suggest, were they Papists or Atheists, is so far from being Persecution, that were you of the temper of the Primitive Christians, you would esteem it as a great priviledg, and instead of reviling, thank the kind Magistrate for the same. But then if on the contrary hand you be considered (and many good English men, and good Christians cannot but consider you) as a sort of men that have formerly raised a most Unnatural Rebellion, and now make Schism in the Church, and Broyles in the State, the punishments you suffer and complain so loudly off, will be so far from seeming Persecution of you as Christians, that they will rather seem your just Desert, as Factious and Turbulent Subjects. And I assure you, that your Brethren in <hi>France</hi> (whom you falsly so call, and for whom you pretend so great respect) are so far from Judging you persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they will not excuse you; but wonder at your non-submission to the Church, and pity your mistakes, that make you stand out against the Laws. They that have seen and examined our English Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which is Printed at <hi>Geneva</hi> in French, cannot understand your Notion of Persecution. And <hi>Ministre Claude,</hi> the most famous of them all, for Piety and Learning, told me in the presence of many others,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58249:10"/>
(after a Discourse, wherein he said all for you that could be said) that he wondred how the <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in <hi>England</hi> could rend the Peace of the Church, for such little indifferent matters; and that, if he were in <hi>England,</hi> he would be of the <hi>Episcopal Party,</hi> and heartily submit himself to the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And if you would do so too, how happy a thing would this be both for your selves and the Nation? Or seeing, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you cannot, yet at least live <hi>Peaceably,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to trouble the World with compassing <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land;</hi> that is, by doing all that you can, like your Fathers the old <hi>Pharisees,</hi> to make <hi>Proselytes;</hi> when yet you cannot shew any sinful condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor prove your way of <hi>Worship</hi> as <hi>Apostolical,</hi> as that of hers; from which out of <hi>Pride, Interest</hi> or <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or partly altogether you Dissent. I am sure this would rather become the Dissenting <hi>Brethren,</hi> then to Foment <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,</hi> Raise <hi>Parties,</hi> betake themselves to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedest of <hi>Men,</hi> as of late to—and cry up the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> which they formerly cried down; which with many other self-contradictions, confirms me in an opinion you know I was of before, That in those matters wherein you differ from us, you are men of no <hi>Principles,</hi> and know not where to fix.</p>
            <p>I have Enlarged upon this <hi>Theam</hi> more than I thought to do at first, because the <hi>Papists</hi> here in <hi>France</hi> complain as loudly as you of the cruelty of our <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Laws;</hi> and cry out wherever they come, how their <hi>Brethren</hi> have been; and still are <hi>Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted among us;</hi> though with this difference, that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58249:10"/>
in disputing <hi>ad hominem,</hi> their case is far more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and pleadable then yours. As for you, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, tho' the <hi>Laws</hi> you complain off look like hard <hi>Laws,</hi> when I consider you as <hi>Free born Subjects</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> yet when I consider you as <hi>Head-strong, Turbulent</hi> and <hi>Factious Subjects,</hi> I cannot but think them just and good, and I will <hi>maintain</hi> that the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution</hi> of them would not be <hi>Persecution,</hi> altho' you were the only true <hi>Christians</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi> For, as I hinted before, you have the Liberty in your <hi>Houses</hi> to profess what <hi>Religion</hi> you please, and to worship <hi>God</hi> in what manner you will: And for fear your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> should not be a <hi>just Congregation,</hi> you may have five more: But for fear you should do as you have <hi>formerly done,</hi> you are not to have five <hi>Hundred,</hi> or five <hi>Thousand;</hi> which Liberty, not only the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Christians,</hi> but our own <hi>Ancestors,</hi> an hundred years ago would have called a Blessing, and a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and have heartily thanked <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> for the same. And <hi>God grant</hi> we may never see that time in <hi>England,</hi> when truly <hi>tender Consciences</hi> will esteem so much Liberty as the greatest blessing in the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The good <hi>Protestants</hi> here in <hi>France,</hi> though their <hi>Religion</hi> is made an <hi>Obstacle</hi> to all <hi>State-preferments,</hi> though it Disable them to sit in the <hi>Courts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> (except just so many as serve in the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Edicts,</hi> to decide <hi>Controversies</hi> between <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi>) or to have any other <hi>Charges</hi> of <hi>Iudicaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or any high Offices in the <hi>Army;</hi> though their Numbers are much diminished, and their Interest weakened, by a <hi>Prohibition</hi> to <hi>Marry</hi> with <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> and by a <hi>Capital Law,</hi> which makes it <hi>Death</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58249:11"/>
to return <hi>Protestants</hi> after they have once turned <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists;</hi> and though a great number of their <hi>Temples</hi> have been demolished (some under a pretence that they were built since the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> others that they were built without <hi>License,</hi> and others that they were built upon <hi>Holy Ground</hi>) so that hereby they are forced in very many places to the <hi>grievous Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of going <hi>two, three, four</hi> or <hi>five Leagues</hi> to <hi>Church,</hi> if not more: And though all the <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Strength,</hi> where they do abound are <hi>Demolished,</hi> and <hi>Cittadels</hi> are <hi>Erected</hi> to awe them in other <hi>Towns,</hi> where they are Numerous; though their own particular <hi>Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> and all other their perpetual <hi>Provisions</hi> for their <hi>Poor,</hi> are taken away, and they disabled, either liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or dying, to give any setled <hi>Maintenance</hi> either to their own <hi>Ministers</hi> or <hi>People</hi> (as to <hi>Endowe Churches, Build Schools, Colledges</hi> or <hi>Hospitals,</hi> &amp;c.) nay, tho' they are deprived of the benefit of other <hi>Hospitals,</hi> provided for the rest of the <hi>Subjects;</hi> and although their Ministers are forbid to speak against the <hi>Pope,</hi> or to <hi>Preach</hi> against the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> with half that freedom and plainness that you dare speak against the Church of <hi>England;</hi> or to <hi>Preach</hi> in any places but those few appointed by the King, though they are forbidden to call the <hi>Papists</hi> in their <hi>Sermons</hi> by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Name but that of <hi>Catholicks;</hi> or to make mention of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> without <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Respect,</hi> though they are forbid to call themselves <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Pastors,</hi> and have no other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle allowed them, but only <hi>Ministres de la Religion pretenduë Reformés;</hi> and though it be <hi>Enacted,</hi> that their Religion shall be called by no other Name in any Publick <hi>Acts, Registers,</hi> &amp;c. Though they are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58249:11"/>
to bury their dead in <hi>Catholick Churches,</hi> or <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi> even where the deceased <hi>Person</hi> was <hi>Patron</hi> of the Church; or where his <hi>Ancestors</hi> had purchased <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-places</hi> for their Families; Though they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to make any <hi>Publick Exhortations</hi> or <hi>Prayer,</hi> or to sing Psalms at their Burial: Though they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to Instruct or Condole those of their own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Prisons</hi> or <hi>Hospitals;</hi> or to pray with them in a voice so loud as to be heard by the standers by, tho' they are forbid to make any Collections of <hi>Money</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves, but such as are permitted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the Edicts of the King; Though they are forbid to Work or open their <hi>Shops</hi> on Romish Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, or to sell Flesh on their Fasting-days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say the good Protestants here in <hi>France,</hi> notwithstanding all this hard dealing, are yet so far from complaining of <hi>Persecution,</hi> that they shew themselves thankful both to God and the King, for the Liberty and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they enjoy. Indeed they will complain, for the aforesaid <hi>Reasons,</hi> that their <hi>Religion</hi> is very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and they themselves hardly used: But Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution is a Notion that they rarely think or speak of, when they discourse of their own condition, being very far, though not so far as you, from a State of <hi>Martyrdom;</hi> which consists in a forcible Obligation to Suffer or Renounce the Truth- And therefore <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin</hi> I beseech you and conjure you, not to misuse the Name of <hi>Persecution</hi> again. It is a very sinful way thus to abuse and amuse the Vulgar, by calling things by their wrong Names: and as to this particular, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and knowing men will be apt to suspect, that through the Name of <hi>Persecution,</hi> you have a design to make your Governours pass for Tyrants, and your selves for Martyrs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:58249:12"/>To conclude: If this which you call <hi>Persecution,</hi> be not such indeed, then I doubt not but they who <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> it so, that is all presumptuous or affectedly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Schismaticks, without bitter pangs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, will be persecuted by the God of <hi>Peace</hi> himself to a sad and endless eternity.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Bill of Comprehension,</hi> it begun to be talked of, before I left my Country, and I have often discours'd it with many of the <hi>Projectors,</hi> but could never understand from them, how it was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable to unite so many <hi>Incompossible Sects,</hi> which agree in nothing, but their opposition to the Church. However if the altering, or taking away of a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or two would <hi>effectually</hi> unite the <hi>Protestant Partys,</hi> as you are pleased to assert, I think it would be worth the while to do it, and that the doing of it for so sure an end, would reflect no dishonour upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which acknowledgeth the few innocent and decent Ceremonies, which she hath ordained to be indifferent and alterable, according to the Exigency of times. Neither, if this were done, could the <hi>Romish Church</hi> have the least apparent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to reproach us for such a slight alteration; seeing her own <hi>Missals</hi> and <hi>Breviaries</hi> have been so diverse and different in several times and places; and have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone so many Emendations, or rather Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before they were established in the present Form, by the Authority of <hi>Pius</hi> V. and the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But unless this Alteration would surely and infallibly produce this effect, it had far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be let alone, and in the mean time, I would have all good Christians wait in Peace and Complyance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58249:12"/>
with the Established Religion, till <hi>Authority</hi> shall think to make this <hi>Alteration</hi> in it, that so a poor <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Traveller would not be tauntingly asked by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impertinent Priest here, Whether he were a true Son of the Church, or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Independant,</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> or <hi>Quaker.</hi> And I assure you, when they meet with a man that owns himself a true <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> they will seem with great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality to pity him more than any other; but yet they will never attempt to convert him. But when they meet with one that will own himself of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort, they will be pleased, smile in their Sleeves, and set upon him as a Person not far from their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. And I am perswaded, had you seen or heard as much of their Idolatries, Blasphemies and Superstitions, as I have done in one <hi>Christmas,</hi> one <hi>Lent</hi> and one <hi>Easter,</hi> you would be so far from doing the Church of <hi>England</hi> any ill Office, that you would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (like St. <hi>Paul</hi> after his <hi>Conversion</hi>) preach against your own <hi>Partizans,</hi> and thank God that you lived in a <hi>Church</hi> reformed from <hi>Romish Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</hi> And I cannot but freely confess, that I am since my <hi>Travels</hi> become ten Times a greater Lover of our own Church, and as many times a greater Hater and Detester of the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> than I was before. And therefore I cannot here dissemble the hearty Grief I have conceived, for the great hopes you have, that the <hi>Licenses</hi> (as you express it) will be once more authorized by his Majesty, or the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration revived. For as it is that which at first was hammered out by a <hi>Popish</hi> Lord, who was the Patron and Idol of the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> so 'tis that which the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58249:13"/>
               <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> here (especially the Priests) do hope, and wish for as well as you. They desire nothing more, than such a <hi>Toleration,</hi> as that was, knowing that it must needs tend to the Ruine of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is the principal Butt of all their Envy and Malice; as being the main support and credit of the <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> every where, and the only hedg against <hi>Popery</hi> it self in our unfortunate <hi>British Isles.</hi> We meet with not a few Priests of several Orders, that have the confidence (in our most familiar confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) to tell us, that by the just Judgment of <hi>God</hi> upon our <hi>Church,</hi> the time of Her <hi>Ruin</hi> is at <hi>Hand;</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> it self being over-spread with Schism and Atheism, and the Hearts of the <hi>Faithful</hi> being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to re-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the <hi>Holy Catholick Truth.</hi> And therefore they freely Confess, that this time of <hi>Distraction</hi> is their <hi>Harvest;</hi> and withal express their Intentions and Zeal to Transport themselves into <hi>England</hi> at the Critical time of Toleration, that they may be Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborers with your selves in that <hi>Harvest.</hi> They seem to lament as much, and complain as fast, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious increase of <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> among us, as you are wont to do of the daily growth of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi> And whilst you both complain alike, and in the formality of your complaints, both alike reflect upon the Church of <hi>England:</hi> It is she only that is the sufferer, and she only that truly laments the growth, and at the same time sets up Banks to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the perfect <hi>Inundation</hi> of all the three among us. As for Schism among <hi>Protestants,</hi> you were the first <hi>Fathers,</hi> and continue the chief Fautors thereof;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58249:13"/>
all the inferior <hi>Sects</hi> having sprung from you, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding both from you and one another, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the same Reasons, for which you profess to divide from the <hi>Church.</hi> And 'tis from you, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Quakering Sect</hi> it self (the dregs of <hi>Schism</hi>) have learned to talk of <hi>Illumination,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Sectaries;</hi> in what number soever they be, differ no more from you than the second, third, or fourth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the first Book of <hi>Euclid.</hi> Not that by this comparison I intend, that you have any such Principles, or <hi>Data</hi> among your selves, as there are among <hi>Mathematicians;</hi> for I am very well assured, that take but any four of the <hi>Presbyterian Demagogues,</hi> and they can scarce agree amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in any four Particulars, wherein they differ from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And therefore if you be not <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> from which you separate, and out of which you have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Congregations,</hi> and preach and administer the <hi>Sacraments</hi> unto them; I say, if you be not <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> then our Church must be the <hi>Schismatick,</hi> in the Controversie between us; and be justly chargable with the same <hi>Indictment,</hi> which she hath drawn up against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> An Assertion, <hi>Cousin,</hi> which I never knew any other Person, except one or two, besides your self, have the confidence to aver, and an Assertion, which no <hi>Protestant</hi> here in <hi>France</hi> could hear us yet relate, without Horror, Impatience and Disdain. And therefore, if the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> from which you wilfully divide, and to which by your Divisions you cause so much Scandal abroad and Evil at home, be not a Schismatical Church,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58249:14"/>
that is, a Church which requires some sinful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Communion; in what a woful condition will your unpeaceable, seditious <hi>Spirits</hi> appear before the God of Peace? And how will you answer that, at the Tribunal of his Wisdom and Justice, which neither your Fathers, nor you could ever yet answer, to those Instruments of his Glory, Judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> and the Venerable <hi>Sanderson?</hi> But whether you are <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> or whether you are not, the Separations which you and your Brood have made from the Church, are the <hi>Apparent Causes</hi> of the <hi>Growth of Popery;</hi> and both your <hi>Separations,</hi> and your <hi>Superstitious Enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Way of Worshipping</hi> that God, whose People you Emphatically pretend to be, are the true Causes of that abundant Atheism, which at present makes <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> an Astonishment and a Scandal to Foreign Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And if you, or any other of the Brother-hood, think it strange, that I charge yours, which is the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Sect,</hi> with Enthusiasm, or make <hi>Superstition,</hi> which seemeth diametrically opposite to <hi>Atheism,</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> thereof; I offer, upon the Challenge, to make good the Charge, in both particulars: But in the mean time, to show you how unsafe it will be to provoke me to that Trouble, I advise you to read one or two short Chapters in the beginning of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, concerning these Distempers of the Soul, and you shall find what I have said, proved with more Demonstration, than you can gainsay; and with more Plainness and Perspicuity, than, I am confident, you would wish to see.</p>
            <p>But besides the <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> the Bloody Wars, which you formerly made in the <hi>State,</hi> under
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58249:14"/>
pretence of the Glory of God, and the Reformation of of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> have given many inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men occasion to suspect, that all Religion, like that of most of your <hi>Leaders,</hi> is but a <hi>Politick Engine</hi> which Men use, to make themselves <hi>Popular</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,</hi> that they may afterwards act with good colour whatsoever their Interest shall suggest. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, to consider, That the great <hi>Pretenders</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the Christian Religion, (which with respect to <hi>Magistrates</hi> teacheth nothing but to <hi>obey</hi> or <hi>su<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er</hi>) should notwithstanding Preach up <hi>Rebellion</hi> against their <hi>Rightful Prince,</hi> Fight Him from Field to Field, Romove Him from Prison to Prison, and at last most barbarously put Him to Death, is such an Absurdity against the Principles of Right Reason, so repugnant to the Laws of our own Nation, and so inconsistent with the Peaceable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel; that, besides the <hi>Atheists</hi> it hath made, it hath, and ever will constrain Men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest <hi>Principles,</hi> and just Resentments, to <hi>Persecute</hi> you with <hi>Satyrs</hi> and <hi>Exclamations</hi> to the end of the World. I had not here presented that Tragical Scene of the King's Murther, but that I have had so many unpleasant Occasions to hear Our <hi>Nation</hi> Reproach'd with the Scandal and Dishonour of that Inhumane Fact. Particularly, it was my bad Fortune to be at a Station in <hi>Paris;</hi> where there were met about two hundred Persons, to read the <hi>Gazetts,</hi> at that very same time, when that of <hi>England</hi> came full charged with the News of Burning the Pope in <hi>Effigie</hi> at <hi>London.</hi> This Feat did at first surprize that <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Concourse of People; but after a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58249:15"/>
they ceased to wonder, saying in every Company as we passed along; <hi>It is not so strange that the English Devils should do this, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Murthered their King.</hi> And another time, it was my ill luck also to be at the same place, when the <hi>London</hi> Gazette brought us the News, <hi>That the House of Lords had taken into consideration the Growth of Atheism in our Nation:</hi> Whereupon some <hi>French Gentlemen</hi> of my acquaintance seriously enquired of me the Causes of so much <hi>Atheism,</hi> amongst such a Thinking and Solid People. I assigned the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which I have written above, besides some others which I will not stand to mention, as the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Causes thereof. And as I hope I did not misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, so I am confident I did not unjustly charge you in any particular, especially with the <hi>Murther of the King.</hi> For there were no Accessaries in the Murther of that Sacred Person; neither was it the last stroke only that fell'd the <hi>Royal Oak;</hi> but you and the Independants, like the two Sacrilegious Priests of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> are equally guilty of the Crime; the one for Binding the direful Victim, and the other for putting the Knife to his Throat.</p>
            <p>But to be short, where I am so unacceptable, I'le conclude my <hi>Argument</hi> with a <hi>Fable.</hi> A <hi>Principal Ship,</hi> which for many <hi>Years</hi> had been Sovereign of the Seas, was at last <hi>Attacted</hi> by a <hi>Tempestuous Wind,</hi> which the Devil raised, and notwithstanding all the <hi>Help</hi> that could be made to save her, was driven by the force of that Malignant Wind, and split upon a <hi>Rock.</hi> The very same Instant she dashed upon the <hi>Rock</hi> the Wind ceased; and being afterwards cursed by the <hi>Sea-men,</hi> for the <hi>Wrack</hi> of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58249:15"/>
the Royal <hi>Charles</hi> (for so the <hi>Capital Vessel</hi> was called) answered, You <hi>Charge</hi> me most unjustly my Friends, it was not I, but the Rock as you saw that split your Ship. The <hi>Moral</hi> of this <hi>Parable</hi> is very <hi>Obvious;</hi> and if the <hi>Application</hi> thereof, or any thing else that I have written, may conduce to awaken your <hi>Conscience,</hi> and reclaim you from <hi>Schism,</hi> I shall think my pains well bestowed. But if you and your seditious <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> will still persevere to assault the Church on one <hi>Hand,</hi> as fast as the <hi>Romish Priests</hi> do undermine her on the <hi>other,</hi> her days are like to be but few and evil; and except God encline the <hi>Hearts</hi> of our <hi>Magistrates</hi> to put the Laws in Execution against them, and find some effectual means to reduce you, you may live to see her Ruin accomplished, which you both alike desire and expect. How numerous you are, the <hi>World</hi> can guess, and if the Accounts which we receive from the Fathers of <hi>Intelligence</hi> of several Orders, be credible, there are about three <hi>Thousand</hi> of them, which find Entertainment and Success within the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>'s Dominions. But in the mean time, till her hour is come, she struggleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst both, like her Saviour against the Pharisees, whose true Disciples in part you both are; they representing those sworn Enemies of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> by the Cabala of their ridiculous and impious Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and you representing them in their <hi>Hypocrisie, Pride, Envy, Evil speaking,</hi> moross and censorious <hi>Dispositions,</hi> &amp;c. (which are Sins scarce consistent with <hi>Humanity,</hi> much less with <hi>Grace</hi>) as likewise in observing many Fasts and making long Prayers, with design not <hi>to serve God,</hi> but to <hi>delude the People.</hi> And therefore I wonder not that you are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58249:16"/>
such malignant Enemies to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> since that Pharisaical spirit, which reigneth so much amongst you, is a wicked Pusilanimous spirit, that affects to be seen in the Head of Parties, and Dictate amongst the Ignorant; and loves as much to <hi>Rule,</hi> as it hates to <hi>Obey.</hi> But would you once be so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, as to subdue your Pride, lay aside your Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, inform your Ignorance, and forsake your dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved <hi>Interest,</hi> for the <hi>Truth;</hi> it would not be long ere we should see you joyn with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> without troubling our Senators to bring you in with an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>incomprehensible Comprehension.</hi> Your <hi>Pride</hi> appeareth in <hi>Heading of Parties,</hi> and in the <hi>Pleasure</hi> you are seen to take in the <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi> that run after you; and in your boasting, that without you the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>People</hi> would starve for want of <hi>Knowledg.</hi> Your <hi>Prejudice</hi> is an effect of your <hi>Pride,</hi> and discovers it self together with your <hi>Ignorance,</hi> in not submitting to those Invincible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which you cannot <hi>Answer.</hi> And as for your <hi>Interest,</hi> the greatest <hi>Paradox</hi> of all, that is evident enough to me, who have so often heard many of you glorifie your selves in the Number and Riches of your Followers, boast of their <hi>Affection</hi> to your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Persons, and brag of the great Sums you have <hi>Collected</hi> in your <hi>Congregations;</hi> which makes the <hi>King's Chapples</hi> (as you arrogantly call your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles</hi>) better places than most of the <hi>Churches,</hi> of which <hi>He is Patron.</hi> And therefore never complain that you live either worse, or at greater uncertainties than you did before. For by your <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> to <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and by other <hi>unworthy</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58249:16"/>
               <hi>Arts,</hi> you have so wrought your selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the esteem of your Disciples, that few of them are either so <hi>Covetuous</hi> or so <hi>Poor,</hi> but they will Pinch at home to supply you. There are several orders of <hi>Fransciscans</hi> here, who have renounced not only <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages,</hi> but all <hi>Temporal Estates</hi> and <hi>Possessions</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; and by their vain Glorious <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities,</hi> they have got (like you) such fast hold on the Souls of the <hi>People</hi> (which is the fastest hold of all) that they can easily make most of them dispose of their <hi>Children,</hi> cashire their <hi>Servants,</hi> and settle their <hi>Estates</hi> as they please; and by these Tricks do more effectually promote the <hi>Interest of Rome,</hi> than all the <hi>Parish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Priests</hi> within the <hi>Pale</hi> of that <hi>Church.</hi> And really, when I consider what <hi>Influence</hi> these <hi>Sanctimonious</hi> and <hi>self-denying Zealots</hi> have o're all Families, in all places where they live; how they <hi>Steal</hi> away the Hearts of the <hi>People</hi> from their <hi>Parish-Priests,</hi> and drain their Congregations; and how the deluded <hi>People</hi> had rather give them the worth of a shilling, than the dues of two pence to their own <hi>Curees;</hi> it makes me often run the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between you and them, and think what a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Gainful Pretence you have got to renounce your Livings, for to secure your Consciences, and to preach the Word <hi>gratis</hi> like the <hi>Primitive Apostles;</hi> when God knows, 'tis not out of love to the People, but to your selves.</p>
            <p>And I protest to you, were I a man to be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and consulted my <hi>Profit</hi> more than the Goodness of my Cause, I should take the same courses
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58249:17"/>
that you do; I should rather be Mr. <hi>M.</hi> than Dr. <hi>A.</hi> of <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and should chuse the plentiful Income of that dull Zealot Dr. <hi>Manton,</hi> before that of his most Learned and Religious Successor of <hi>Govent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi> But though you live very well, and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed than most of the Ministers of the Church, yet the Mischief of it is, you are uncapable of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which makes you such <hi>Aerians,</hi> and upon all occasions openeth your Throats as wide as Sepulchres against the Bishops and the Church. You know what an History of Bishops Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath wrote, and what a fair Collection the Learned <hi>Smec.</hi> hath taken out of him; as if when a Bishop is defective, either in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Learning or the Skill of Government, it were not the deplorable unhappiness, but the fault of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Should an Heathen or Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, make such an Historical Collection of Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Christians, either in this, or former Ages, you would not be perswaded for all that, to prefer the <hi>Alcoran</hi> before the Gospel; or the most exalted <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganism</hi> whatsoever, before the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> Therefore wise and sober men will make no <hi>Inference</hi> but this, from such a malicious enumeration of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; that corruptions will creep into Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithstanding all the care that can be used to the contrary; and that by the favour of <hi>Princes</hi> (who hear with other mens ears, and often receive undeserved <hi>Characters</hi> of Men) sometimes <hi>Ambitious,</hi> sometimes <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Slothful, Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> or <hi>Debauched Persons,</hi> will be <hi>Preferred</hi> to the most <hi>Honourable Dignities</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> But this, as often as it happens, is the misery of the <hi>Church</hi> of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58249:17"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> which all true <hi>Church men</hi> lament; though the men of the short <hi>Cloke</hi> take all such occasions to expose her to the scorn of the <hi>common people</hi> who judge <hi>by Sense,</hi> and not by <hi>Reason;</hi> and who are taught by you, to make no distinction between the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> But were all her <hi>Bishops</hi> the best <hi>Christians,</hi> the best <hi>Scholars</hi> and the best <hi>Governours</hi> in the <hi>World;</hi> and should the <hi>Royal Hand</hi> place her Mytres on the <hi>Heads</hi> of none but <hi>Iewels, Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift's, Andrews's, Hall's, Usher's, Morton's, Taylor's,</hi> and <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s, yet that Unchristian <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Discontent,</hi> which informs the <hi>Non conformists,</hi> would still fly upon her with open Mouth, like <hi>Beasts</hi> upon the <hi>Saints</hi> of old condemned to the <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater;</hi> and make her, as she hath already been for almost forty years, a <hi>Spectacle</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Angels,</hi> and to Men. The wicked Lives of <hi>Scandalous Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> if there be any such, are her sad Misfortune, but cannot justifie the <hi>Schism</hi> you are guilty of; who are bound to hear even them, as much as the <hi>Iews</hi> were bound to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> those <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> that sate in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Chair. And in that deplorable state of the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> when the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> were both alike cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and called by the <hi>Holy Spirit, Dumb and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Dogs,</hi> yet it had been unlawful to make a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and set up other Altars against that which <hi>God</hi> (who was their <hi>King</hi>) had set up. I cannot but mind you of the <hi>Sehism</hi> of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> was pleased to divide the Kingdom into two parts, made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Secession, and write all, that is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58249:18"/>
necessary to discover and aggravate the damnable Nature of Schism, would require as much more <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> as I have bestowed, and so make me as tedious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as, I fear, I have already been. Besides, it would oblige me to answer Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>'s Treatise of Schism, with whose Leaves you vainly endeavour to cover your shame: And I had indeed a year ago underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that easie Task, but that a <hi>Western</hi> Gentleman, to whom I discovered my Intentions, told me, That Mr. <hi>Long Prebendary</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> a Friend of his, had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begun that good Work: so that I hope it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this time. And if either that or this, or any thing else, a thousand times better, than I am able to write, may prove effectual to reclaim you from <hi>Schism;</hi> I shall be as glad, as to see some other of our <hi>Friends</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from Drunkenness, Swearing, and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which are very grievous, and dreadful Sins, but yet not more damnable in their Nature, nor more distructive to the Christian Religion, nor more deeply rooted in the Soul of man, than that of Schism; From which, I pray God, by the Power of his Grace, to Preserve me, and Reform you, through <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> our Lord; to whose Protection I commit you, and rest,</p>
