            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Condition, and neceſsitated Deſignment for Relief.</head>
            <p>VVHereas by the ſad diſtraction of this Nation, and the fall of our late Soveraign and Maſter, We, with
our Wives and Children, have been expoſed to the greateſt miſeries of want, ſome of our Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being famiſhed to death, and moſt of us, with our Families, likely to periſh, if not timely reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after many waies attempted by humble Petitions, and all earneſt ſolicitations, being ſtill helpleſs, and now alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
without hope of relief, we have made this our laſt refuge, even to caſt our ſelves and our Families upon the
Charity of Pious diſpoſed Chriſtians, in confidence, that God hearing our loud cries, and graciouſly pittying our
ſad diſtreſs, will move their hearts with a relieving bounty. And to prevent the abuſing of any mans Charity
through Impoſture, by ſome pretending themſelves to have been the late Kings Servants; and others taking upon
them as imployed in their behalf; We the late Kings Servants, about the number of fifty, have joyned our ſelves in
a common Collection of the privat and Charitable Contributions of thoſe whom God ſhall move with pitty for
our relief (our Families many of them being very great:) And have obtained the favour of ſome worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of known integrity, to overſee the equal diſtribution of what is Collected, according to each perſons place, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
and condition. And to take off all ſuſpition of deceit in the Collection, the Collectors imployed in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
are to receive by Box and Seal, what ſhall be contributed to our relief, or indorſed on the backſide of the Papers
in words at length.</p>
            <p>Theſe three Doctors are pleaſed to be Overſeers, to ſee things equally carried, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to each mans place, neceſſity, and condition.

be really true; and therefore do recommend their very miſerable condition to others Charitable Contribution.</p>
