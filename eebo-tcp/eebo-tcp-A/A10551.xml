            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is no doubt, that the corruption of the Aire, together with vncleanly and vnwholſome keeping of dwell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ouſes, as without in the ſtreets, at times when the Aire is infected, are great occaſions to increaſe, corrupt, and produce peſtilent Diſeaſes. Neither can it be denyed, that the ouer-boldneſſe of many prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into infected places, and the lewdneſſe of others with Sores vpon them, preſuming into the open Ayre, ſome of wilfulneſſe, but truly many of neceſsity, contaminateth and corrupteth diuers: as the Leproſie, the Pocks, and ſundry ſuch vncleane diſeaſes doe: as by drinking, lying in company, and other ſuch meanes, where pure complexions and cleane blouds are defiled with ſuch as are putrified; and therefore carefully to be auoyded. But all theſe are accidentall, and rather effects then the cauſe. For it plainly appeareth in the Booke of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that when it pleaſed the Almighty God to ſmite the Aegyptians, the Children of <hi>Jſrael</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to dip Iſop in the Bloud of the Paſchall Lambe, and ſmite of that bloud on the outward Poſts of their dores, that when the ſlayer came to deſtroy in one night all the firſt borne in Aegypt, he might paſſe ouer the houſes of Gods children. So that it is plaine, it was an Angell then ſent to ſmite thoſe cruell people with the Peſtilence.</p>
            <p>Then firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this City of <hi>London,</hi> cannot be denyed, to haue had as great bleſsings as euer had Ieruſalem: for here God hath long time beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by his Word and Sacraments, yet they haue abounded in all iniquity, when Ieruſalem long ſince had not a ſtone left vpon a ſtone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>London</hi> is ſituated as pleaſantly as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and her ſiſter Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before they ſunke, euen for the ſame ſinnes that wee haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for the ſinne of <hi>Sodom</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel)</hi> was pride, fulneſſe of bread, and contempt of the poore. That theſe ſinnes raigne in <hi>London,</hi> who can deny? To them, adde fulneſſe of drinke; for therein wee exceede the Nation, that within theſe fifty yeeres wee hated for drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe: and I doubt, That vnname<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>able ſinne of Sodomy is vſed in too many places of the City. Yet <hi>London</hi> ſtands, and ſo God grant with his mercy it long may.</p>

            <p>In the City, called the great <hi>Caire,</hi> there is a Plague once euery ſeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the yeere of Chriſt, 81. and in the yeere 188. there continued a great time a Plague in <hi>Rome,</hi> of which there dayly dyed two thouſand people.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 254. fifteene Prouinces of the Romane Empire, were in a manner conſumed with the Peſtilence.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 530<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there dyed in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> fiue thouſand a day, and diuers times ten thouſand: and at that time, in ſome other parts of Greece, there were not ſufficient liuing men left to bury their dead.</p>
            <p>And in the yeere 1569. there fell ſuch a Plague in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that there died in ſix moneths ſpace, ſeuen hundred thouſand perſons, and the yeere following fell ſuch a famine, that a penny loafe of Bread of Engliſh money, was worth a crowne of gold: by reaſon whereof, the people died as faſt then of the Famine, as they did before of the Plague.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 540. there began an vniuerſall Plague all ouer the world, that continued 50. yeeres with great violence.</p>

            <p>In the yeere 1359. ſo great a Peſtilence there was in <hi>Italy,</hi> that there were ſcarce ten left of a thouſand.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 1521. there died in <hi>Rome</hi> a hundred thouſand of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence.</p>
