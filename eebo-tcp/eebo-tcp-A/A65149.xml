            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

cauſe of this was offering of ſtrange fire, humane inventions in
the Worſhip of God, and reſiſting <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> the true

Inventions in the Worſhip of God, have often times brought
the plague upon his people; See <hi>Pſal. 106. 29. Thus they vexed

They had once left off Idolatry as abominable, but now they are

Province the men that were capable of bearing arms, that he
might ſee his ſtrength, and take confidence in them; but God
would not take this at his hands; whereas <hi>David</hi> had been
brought to the Crown meerly by the hand of God, had lived an
exile for a conſiderable time, was hunted up and down from one
Countrey to another, had no ſafe abiding place, and at laſt was
lifted into the Throne by a meer hand of providence, though
annointed King long before; Now for <hi>David</hi> to forget that God
that ſaved him, reſtored him, and ſo eminently honored him, and
to rely &amp; truſt in the multitude of an Hoſt, to reſt upon an arm of
fleſh, and ſecure himſelf under the wings of a numerous Militia,
this provoked God ſo highly, that he ſent forth the Peſtilence,
and ſlew in a ſhort time ſeventy thouſand men.</p>

            <p>There is alſo a ſpiritual meaning of this Hiſtory; by Manna is

gave them bread from Heaven to eat: Then Jeſus ſaid unto them,
Verily, verily I ſay unto you, Moſes gave you not the bread from

            <p>There are many other cauſes for which God ſends this Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

and their lies have cauſed them to err after the which
their fathers have walked.</hi> When a people ſhall forſake the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>1. The firſt Plague was for oppreſſing and per ſecuting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, and not letting them go to worſhip as he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
O ye Magiſtrates, look to this, your heavy hard upon
Gods people, hath brought the heavy hard of God upon this
City. Swearing, Whoring, Drunkeneſs, Sabbath-breaking &amp; other
crying ſins ye have left unpuniſhed; but if a company of poor
Chriſtians had but met peaceably in a corner to pray to their
God, and exhort one another in the things that concern their
eternal ſalvation, with what eagerneſs have you hunted after
them? with what taunts &amp; deriſion, even bitter and ſcurrilous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion
have you examined them? with what remorſleſs ſeverity
have you condemned them? how full of blameleſs Chriſtians have
your priſons bin, for no other Crime but <hi>matters of their God?</hi>
you cannot ſay that they were puniſhed for this or that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35198:7"/>
error, or deſtructive opinion, for their judgments and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
you never examined; the only crime alledged, was for
meeting in private to worſhip God. Surely had you been in the
primative, the Apoſtles and Churches of Chriſtians who
differed from the Magiſtrate in point of worſhip had by you
fallen under the ſame condemnation with us. Your Ale-houſes
full of drunkards, streets and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond crime mentioned, was inventions of men in the
worſhip of God, Now I beſeech you as you love your own ſouls
and would have the Plague ſtayed, be humbled for this great ſin,
examine by what Spirit, by what Authority, of whoſe compoſing
your worſhip i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, did God ever command thoſe ſervices, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Altars, Veſtures, Geſtures, Saints days, and formalities, in
which is the chief of your worſhip? did God ever bleſs them to
convert a ſoul from Satan to Jeſus Chriſt? did God own them in
healing &amp; comforting of a wounded conſcience? are they the beſt
of men, the moſt holy, and mortified, in whoſe ſouls ſtead you
would venture your ſouls when you come to dye; that are the
Authors Abettors and zealous followers of ſuch worſhip? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that God would not bear the ten Tribes for making but
one holy-day like the Feaſt himſelf had inſtituted; yet, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes dedicated to Saints, kept holy to them, and perſons pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
that obſerve them, not, do you obſerve? a Heathen inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at firſt for the renown of their Devils and Heroes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in imitation of them taken up by the moſt ignorant <hi>Papiſts</hi>
in the moſt corrupt times of Popery. Examine whether the
Names, Titles, Offices, Dignities and Juriſdictions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
are by Divine Appointment, whether they have the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
of a Goſpel-Miniſtry, and the care of Goſpel-Miniſters, and
if you find that perſons and things, worſhip and Miniſters have
not the ſtamp of Divine Authority upon them, oh repent, repent
that ever you have provoked God to jealouſie, that you have
ſtirred up his hot diſpleaſure by your making to your ſelves
Graven Images.</p>

3. The third Plague mentioned, was for open-faced uncleanneſs.
And never did any age abound with ſuch impudent practiſes of
this kind, as this age and place; great perſons whoſe examples are
the Rule of inferiors, have ſome of them publikely declared their
ſin like <hi>Sod me,</hi> openly ſhewing their nakedneſs; others violently
forcing women, openly attempting the chaſtity of ſome, which
if not reſcued, had been violated by them; others murdering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
becauſe they would not ſerve their luſts, and many living in
profeſſed adultery, owning of it, and glorying in it, as if the holy
God will never viſit for theſe things. <hi>But Whoremonger sand
Adulterers God will judge.</hi> Therefore ye Adulterers and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes,
mourn for your ſins, go to God by prayer for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of them, it may be you may yet find grace in his ſight: <hi>Iſa.
55. 7. Let the wicked for ſake his way, and the unrighteous man
his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have
mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly pardon;</hi>
pray for a clean heart, that God would mortifie your hainous
and unruly luſts that war againſt your ſouls, and will aſſuredly
bring you to hell, if ye repent not. To you Magiſtrates, if you
have any pity for your own ſouls, or for this great City, Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
judgement upon incorrigible offenders in this kind; ſee how
this duty zealouſly performed, ſtayed the Plague, <hi>Numb. 25. 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. And when Phineas the ſon of Eleazer the
ſon of Aaron the Prieſt, ſaw it, be roſe up from among the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and took a javelin in his hand, and he went after the man of
Iſrael into the tent, and thruſt both of them through, the man of
Iſrael and the woman through her belly; ſo the Plague was ſtayed
from the Children of Iſrael. And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Phineas the ſon of Eleazer, the ſon of Aaron the Prieſt hath
turned away my wrath from the Children of Iſrael, (while he was
zealous for my ſake amongſt them, that I conſumed not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael in my jealouſie.) Wherefore ſay, behold I give unto
him my Covenant of peace, and he ſhall have it, and his ſeed after
him, &amp;c.</hi> Up and be doing ye Magiſtrates of this great City, let
your zeal run in the right channel, againſt the enormous ſins of
the times. But be it known unto you, if you ſhall be negligent
and remiſs in this work, God wil raiſe up Saviours, God wil ſpirit
ſome or other that ſhall execute Judgement and Juſtice, and
you ſhall fall in your iniquities.</p>
            <p>

4. The fourth Plague was for carnal confidence in an A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leets have been in
other hands; yet how eaſily did the great God, for cauſes beſt
known to himſelf, take away the hearts, and take the people out
of the hands of thoſe men, who in their day were the terror of
the Nations round about them? be not high-minded, but fear; for
if it hath been done thus to the green Tree, what ſhall bed done to
the dry Tree? lay to heart that Scripture, Jer. 17. 5, 6 <hi>Curſed
be the man that maketh fleſh his A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

from the Lord, for he ſhall be like the Heath in the Deſart, and
ſhall not ſee when good cometh, but ſhall in habit the parched places
of the Wildeneſs.</hi> And as to the diverting the judgments procured
by this ſin, I adviſe all perſons who have been hightned by their
carnal confidences, to do as David did. 2 Sam. 24 10. <hi>And Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
heart ſmote him after that he had numbred the people, and
David ſaid unto the Lord, I have ſinned greatly in that I have
done take away the iniquity of thy Servant, for I have done fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
And v. 17. <hi>And David ſpake unto the Lord when he ſaw the
Angel that ſmote the people, and ſaid, I have ſinned and done
wickedly, but theſe ſheep what have they done? let thy hand I
pray thee be againſt me and againſt my Fathers houſe.</hi> Here was a
tender Magiſtrate, that preferred his peoples welfare before
his own. Oh that great perſons would behold with compaſſion
how many thouſands their ſins have hurried to the grave, and
that they would repent and turn to the Lord!</p>

after Quarles: if there were no other argument to perſons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
But the grandure and noble houſe-keeping of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,

God will fulfil this word upon you, even utterly to root
you out except you repent.</p>
            <p>And as to the common ſort, who have been encouraged by
your example, are they not wretchedly poluted? nothing but
ſwearing, curſing, drunkenneſs, and among them Hell is broke

ſo that God may juſtly ſpread your Carkaſes as dung upon the

more righteous and ſober generation.</p>
            <p>Now therefore to conclude, You that have any tenderneſs left,
that have not quite transformed your ſelves to Beaſts and Devils,
you that would eſcape Hell, you that can with any remorſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the dying-pale-face of this Nation, ſtabb'd at the heart by
theſe ſins of yours, Oh tremble at the fierce wrath of God that is
gone forth againſt you, and abhor your ſelves for all your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
there is yet ſome encouragement left for you to turn and
be ſaved, 2 <hi>Chr. 7. 13, 14. If I ſend the Peſtilence among my people,
if my people that are called by my Name, ſhall humble themſelves,

will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their ſins, and will heal
their Land.</hi> Be humbled for, and turn from all your wicked
wayes, and be upon your faces in the duſt for mercy and pardon,
before the deſtroying Angel arreſt you, and you be brought to
the Bar of Divine Juſtice, where every impenitent ſinner will
receive this ſentence, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting

Errand, and his buſineſs is to call you home to your Fathers
