            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Neither needed I goe farre to find my occaſion and ſubject; but even to make uſe of that, which in your ſervice, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walls of your own houſe, I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: I meane my obſervations of the manner of painting in uſe among the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. For ſeeing your Ladiſhip upon the firſt ſight of my Latine copie, was pleaſed to expreſſe your deſire of having it Engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; there ſeemed a way to be opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Nor doe I ſo much over-ween, but that I ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that this tranſlation befitteth rather the native fluency of one in-bred, than the forced ſtile of a forrainer; and therfore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſevere eyes it might ſeeme an unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable preſumption, to have taken upon me a burden ſo unfit for my ſhoulders to beare, and therewith to interrupt your higher conceits; yet feeling my ſelfe inſpired with courage by the ſignification of your noble deſire (which wrought in my heart, what an abſolute command uſeth to worke in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) I ſtoutly fell to my taske. Wherein I doubt not, but that, if your Honor by a

favourable construction ſhall judge me not altogether undutifull, though not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly officious; others alſo will think that this my forwardneſſe in accompliſhing your deſire, may make all pardonable, if not in ſome degree acceptable.

               <p>§ 3. It remaineth howſoever, that among ſo many Art as doe procure us everlaſting glory, this Art is none of the meaneſt. And as it is a very great matter to carry in our mind the true images both of living and lifeleſſe creatures,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11347:8"/>
ſo is it a greater matter to worke out a true and lively ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of thoſe inward images; eſpecially if the Artificer doth not tie his imitation to ſome particular, though never ſo faire a body; but followeth rather the perfection of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward image made up in his mind by a moſt earneſt and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous obſervation of all ſuch bodies as in their owne kind are moſt excelling. <hi>Such as carve images,</hi> ſayth <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi>

Wherefore, when this noble Artificer intended to leave unto the inhabitants of Crotona a choice patterne of a moſt beautifull woman, he did not thinke it good to ſeeke the perfection of a fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe formoſitie in one particular body; but he pick'd out of the whole Citie five of the well-favouredſt virgins, to the end he might find in them that <hi>perfect beautie, which,</hi> as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſpeaketh <note n="*" place="margin">In Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo.</note>, <hi>of neceſſitie muſt be but one.</hi> So doth <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi> very fitly to this purpoſe bring in <hi>Socrates</hi> his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe held with the Painter <hi>Parrhaſius, ſeeing it is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> ſayth <hi>Socrates</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§ 5. Neither may the great multitude of naturall things that our Imitation buſieth it ſelfe withall, put us in ſuch a fright as to hinder our good endeavours; ſeeing it is no more requiſite in this Art then in many other Arts, that we ſhould after a moſt troubleſome manner goe over every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thing; as if it were not poſſible to attaine to perfection, unleſſe we did learn to imitate all things that are in Nature. Certainly, the large diffuſed nature of things cannot abide
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11347:9"/>
that a teacher ſhould weary his ſchollars with ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of figures; and whoſoever doth undertake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing, <hi>ſhall undergoe theſe two inconveniences,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quintilian</hi>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:11347:10"/>
                  <hi>things; but having once perceived the true manner of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he ſhall eaſily hit the ſimilitude of ſuch things as ſhall be offered him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 6. The firſt principles then of theſe Arts of imitation, doe not demand an endleſſe labour, but rather contenting themſelves with a few very moderate and eaſie documents of meet proportions, doe forthwith preſent us an open and ready acceſſe unto the moſt inward ſecrets of Art. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the whole <hi>Art of painting,</hi> may wondrous well be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in a ſmall number of precepts, which as they are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe neceſſary, ſo are they for all that to be delivered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort and plaine way. When there is on the contrary a great ſtirre kept about the firſt rudiments of theſe Arts, it is very often ſeene, that young beginners are alienated from the Art, by reaſon of ſo diffuſed and intricate a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inſtitution: their wits alſo, that had more need at the firſt to be cheriſhed and encouraged, grow dull and ſottiſh, being overwhelmed with a dry and barren multitude of farre fetch'd inſtructions: they doe ſometimes alſo, to the great hindrance of their good proceedings, fooliſhly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, that they are already as good Artificers as the beſt of them, though they have done no more but ſlenderly learned by heart, and practiſed but groſſely, ſome diſorderly precepts, that are boaſted to conteine the very pith and marrow of the whole Art: Many lively ſpirits at length are moſt pittifully turned away from their forward courſe, after they have enthralled themſelves into ſuch a miſ-leading labyrinth of confuſed and intricate precepts, and having once loſt that freeneſſe of ſpirit, by which the Art is moſt of all advanced, they give over all good endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, they doe ſtagger at every little occaſion, not daring to depart one inch from the much admired and highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11347:10"/>
rules of Art. It is then expedient that we ſhould not wander, but rather follow a ſetled ſhort way, eaſie both for learners and teachers. Neither is it amiſſe, a beginner ſhould ſtrongly be poſſeſſed with this opinion, that there is a certain good way, in which Nature muſt do many things of her owne accord without any teaching; ſo that the grounds of Art may ſeeme not ſo much to have been found out by teachers, as to have been obſerved onely by them, when excellent Artificers that followed the unpremedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and unreſtrained motions of Nature practiſed them. To what we have hither to propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded out of <hi>Quintilian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ex prooemio libri octavi.</note>, the words of <hi>Aquila Romanus</hi> may very well be applied, <hi>all things almoſt,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">De Figuris ſententiaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>, <hi>that are contained in the firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, are put in practice by quick-witted men, not ſo much out of knowledge as by chance. It is left onely that we bring to their workes ſome kind of learning, and a great deale of attention, to the end that we might not onely perceive ſuch virtues as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares they have imparted to us, but that wee alſo might have them afterwards at command as often as occaſion ſhall require.</hi> It is then a very poore and ſilly ſhift, to lay the fault of our owne ſluggiſhneſſe upon the difficultie of the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: this pretence can avail us nothing at all: ſeeing theſe Arts do indifferently without any regard of perſons, invite all ſtudious hearts to take their fill of that ſweetneſſe they doe affoord. It is likewiſe a very unnoble and faint-hearted litherneſſe, to ſuffer the heat of our moſt fervent deſire to be cooled, by reaſon that ſome have to very ſmall purpoſe taken a great deale of paines about theſe Arts; ſeeing <hi>the knowledg of all ſuch kind of Arts,</hi> ſaith <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi>

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 10.</note>, <hi>is by nature more gorgeouſly precious, how leſſe common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 7. Beſides all this, there is yet another maine reaſon why ſome are ſo loath to meddle with theſe Arts; for they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11347:11"/>
can never ſee them brought to ſuch a perfection, but that there is alway ſomething left, which requireth, if not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, at leaſt trimming and poliſhing. <hi>The facultie of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> ſayth <hi>Plato</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. VI. de Legib.</note>, <hi>knoweth no end in painting, but findeth ſtill ſomething to change or to adde; and it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that beautie and ſimilitude ſhould receive ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute conſummation, as not to admit any further encreaſe.</hi> Thus doe they decline the ſuppoſed toileſomneſſe of this Art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leaſt experiment; and they will not reſolve to doe any thing, becauſe they doe forſooth deſpaire to doe all. Neither is there any poſſibilitie to cure this overthwart hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of theirs, unleſſe they doe firſt learne out of <hi>Vegetius</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. II. de Re militari, cap.</hi> 18.</note>, that <hi>all kind of worke ſeemeth to be hard before we doe try it.</hi> They muſt ſecondly, conſider what a vehement efficacy there is in mans wit; <hi>whereſoever you doe bend your wit,</hi> ſayth <hi>Saluſt, it will prevaile. Maximus Tyrius</hi> likewiſe, <hi>what is there,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">Diſſert. XVIII.</note>, <hi>which the all-daring ſoule of a man cannot cunningly find out, when ſhee hath but a mind to it?</hi> They are thirdly, to marke how great a matter they goe about. The reward of their labour, if they doe not ſhrinke and play the cowards, ſhall be an Art of Arts, an Art no leſſe profitable then glorious. <hi>It is a moſt ſhamefull thing,</hi> ſayth <hi>Tullie</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Circa ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium libri primi de Finibus.</note>, <hi>to grow weary, when the thing we ſtudy to obtain is of great worth.</hi> The which if we doe rightly conceive, wee ſhall alſo more readily entertaine this opinion, that the way is not unpaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor difficult. For the firſt and greateſt ayd cometh from our will: and if we can but bring an unfainedly willing mind to theſe Arts, the worſt will be paſt; ſeeing the things we are to learne, may be had by a few yeares ſtudy. The onely reaſon that maketh the way to ſeem long and tedious, is, becauſe we doe nothing but haſte and draw back at the leaſt ſhadow of difficulties, ſuffering our courages to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11347:11"/>
daunted with the imagination of a wrongly conceived hardneſſe. Let us but thinke the inſtitution ſhort and eaſie, and we ſhall finde it eaſie enough. And if we doe perhaps by the way light upon ſome hard and difficult matter, it may quickly be made eaſier by an orderly and diſcreet way of teaching. But now is the firſt and greateſt fault in the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that doe moſt willingly detaine their diſciples about the firſt principles: partly out of covetouſneſſe, that by ſo doing they might the longer enjoy their gaines: partly out of ambition, that ſo it might ſeeme the harder what they themſelves profeſſe: ſometimes alſo out of meere ignorance and negligence. The next fault is in the ſchollars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that had rather ſtay and dwell upon thoſe things they doe know already, then to proceed further to what they are as yet ignorant of. We doe moreover ſhorten our own time, fooling the greateſt part of our beſt houres away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a company of pratling viſiters; beſides that ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes, banquets, cards and dice, unneceſſary journeys, the immoderate care of our pampered carkaſſes, rob us alſo of a good deale of time that might be better huſbanded: not to ſpeake of wanton luſts, drunkenneſſe, and other ſuch like beaſtly vices, by the which our diſtempered bodies waxe altogether unfit to make good uſe of ſo ſmall a remnant of our time. This then being our daily practice, yet are we for all this waſtfull laviſhneſſe of our youthfull dayes not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to complaine that the Art is long, the time ſhort, the experience hard and difficult; three lives, in our opinion, are too little that we ſhould in them attaine to a perfect knowledge of theſe moſt copious Arts: wheras on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if we would make good uſe of our good leiſure, wee ſhould rather thankfully confeſſe that we are not in want of time; and if we doe lacke any, that it is long of the idle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11347:12"/>
and brutiſh luſts we are given to; ſeeing not the daies onely doe affoord us time enough, but the nights alſo; whoſe length is abundantly able both to quench our deſire of ſleeping, and alſo to ſtirre up our phantaſie by a ſilent quietneſſe. Even as in travelling ſuch men as goe their way readily without any delay, come to their Innes as ſoone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as others that ſetting forth at the ſame minute doe by the way wander up and downe to meet ſomewhere with a refreſhing ſhade, or a delectable water-ſpring; ſo is there in matter of Art an unſpeakable difference betweene lazie lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerers and active ſpirits. Let us then take heed of ſo groſſe an error, as to judge of the difficultie of theſe Arts by the time of our life, and not by the time of our ſtudy: for if we doe but order the time of our youth wiſely, if wee doe not turne aſide unto any idle and time-waſting ſports, wee ſhall find time enough: neither may we pretend any want of meanes, that ſhould helpe us to attaine to the perfection of theſe Arts, for if we do conſider it right, we ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acknowledge with <hi>Quintilian</hi>

For as much then as it is moſt evident that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of theſe Arts are not too hard, and likewiſe that we are not in want of time, ſome do for all that play the modeſt men, alleadging for an excuſe the perfection of theſe Arts to be ſuch, that they may not without a great preſumption hope to atchieve them, yea that it is wholly impoſſible to be perfect in them; Serveth for anſwer: that it is not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the nature of things that ſomewhat ſhould be done now, which in former times as yet was never done;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11347:12"/>
ſeeing all ſuch things as now are great and notable, have had alſo a time they were not. Neither is there any reaſon why we ſhould ſlacke our endeavors, having beſides the helpe of a reaſonably good wit the advantage of a healthfull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as alſo the guiding of a truſty teacher: and though we cannot mount up to the higheſt top of perfection, yet it is ſomething for all that to ſticke out above the reſt in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third place. <hi>It no is ſmall glory,</hi> ſayth <hi>Columella</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

This is a poore and ſlender argument, I ſay, ſeeing that ſuch as heretofore in the opinion of all the world, have been the beſt and moſt renowned Artificers, ſhould never have obtained the glory of that name, if taking courage they had not hoped ſtill to doe better then the beſt of their predeceſſors; and though by chance it were not in their power to overtake and to out-run the beſt Artiſts, yet did they alway ſtrive to come ſo neere as to tread upon their heeles: beſides that we may daily ſee how an indifferently good practice of theſe Arts is very neere as profitable as the moſt perfect Art it ſelfe. Though now it were an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to ſhew that theſe Arts almoſt in all ages have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the chiefeſt ſway in the favour of great Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, that likewiſe by this means beſides the due reward of glory, they have got themſelves an infinite maſſe of wealth; yet do we eſteeme the mention of ſuch rewards to come far ſhort of the worthines of theſe Arts, and of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient contentment they doe finde in themſelves. But of this we ſhall ſpeake elſewhere at large. It is left onely that all ſuch
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11347:13"/>
as thinke well of theſe Arts, ſhould aſpire unto the excellency of the ineſtimable Arts themſelves without any by-reſpects: which doing, they ſhall undoubtedly reach the higheſt ſtep of perfection, or atleaſt be lifted up to ſuch a height as to ſee a great many left underneath their feet.</p>
               <p>§ 9. It is an ordinary practice among Poets to call in the firſt entrance of their workes upon the <hi>Muſes,</hi> craving of them ſuch a readineſſe of invention and utterance, that their Poems guſhing forth as out of a plentifull water-ſpring, might with a gentle ſtreame refreſh and charme the hearts and eares of aſtoniſhed men. The Artificers may likewiſe, before they doe goe about this worke, very fitly ſalute the ſweet company of the nine learned Siſters; not ſo much to aſke of them a good and proſperous ſucceſſe of what they take in hand, as well to obſerve out of the proper ſignification of their names the ſeverall ſteps that lead a Novice into the right way of perfection. <hi>The firſt of the Muſes,</hi> ſayth <hi>Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol.</note>, <hi>is named</hi> Clio, <hi>which name ſhe hath out of a Greek word, ſignifying fame: and by this name there is infinuated unto us the firſt and greateſt motive that ſtirreth in us a deſire of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: ſeeing the knowledge of good Arts and Sciences doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our fame to the memory of late poſterities. The ſecond is</hi> Euterpe, <hi>that is, full of delight; for as we doe firſt ſeeke know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo do we afterwards delight in ſeeking. The third is</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomene, <hi>that is, ſetling of meditation; for as there followeth upon our firſt reſolution a deſire to effect what we have reſolved upon, ſo doth there upon this reſolution follow an attentive ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe to obtaine our longing. The fourth is</hi> Thalia, <hi>that is, apprehenſion; for it is ever ſeen that the apprehenſion, in a mind not altogether uncapable, doth follow upon the earneſtneſſe of attention. The fifth is</hi> Polymnia, <hi>that is, the remembrance of many things; for it is moſt of all required after the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:11347:13"/>
                  <hi>that we ſhould perfectly remember the things rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. The ſixt is</hi> Erato, <hi>that is, finding ſomething like; for it may juſtly be exſpected, that the Artificer after a well-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred knowledge, ſhould invent ſomething of his owne, not unlike the things apprehended and remembred by him. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth is</hi> Terpſichore, <hi>that is, delighting in the inſtruction; for it doth follow upon the invention of new matters, that we ſhould judge of them and diſcerne them cheerfully. The eight is</hi> Urania, <hi>that is, heavenly; for wee doe after this care of judging make choice of ſuch things as are fit to be further wrought upon, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt; which is the worke of a high and heavenly wit. The ninth is</hi> Calliope, <hi>that is, of a good utterance. The whole connexion is thus linked together. The firſt degree is, that wee deſire knowledge: the ſecond, that we delight in this deſire: the third, that we doe eagerly follow the thing wee thus delight in: the fourth, that wee doe apprehend the thing followed: the fift, that wee remember what we once apprehended: the ſixt, that wee doe invent ſomething like unto the remembred apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the ſeventh, that wee examine and diſcerne our inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the eight, that wee chooſe the beſt of thoſe things we have judged and diſcerned: the ninth, that wee doe well expreſſe the things well choſen.</hi>

For the inward Imaginations that doe continually ſtirre and play in our minds, cannot be conceived and faſhioned therein, unleſſe our eyes ſome manner of way are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the true ſhape of the things imagined, or at leaſt that wee have felt them with ſome of our ſenſes. <hi>Our mind,</hi> ſayth <hi>Strabo</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11347:14"/>
by the phantaſie. <hi>Some Artificers,</hi> ſayth <hi>Proclus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. II. in Timaeum Platonis.</note>, <hi>can imitate the workes of others moſt accurately; where as other workmen have rather an inventive qualitie, to deviſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes for the uſe of man: ſo hath he that firſt made a ſhip, phantaſtically conceived a platform of what be meant to make.</hi> The ſame Author goeth yet further; <hi>whatſoever is made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a conceived or intelligible thing,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>, <hi>is faire what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever on the contrary is made after a thing generated, is not faire. For he that maketh any thing after intelligible things, muſt needs make it like the conceived things, or elſe unlike: if he doth make it like by imitation, ſo is it that the imitation of neceſſitie ſhall be faire; ſeeing there is in the conceived things a principall beautie: but if the Imitation be unlike, then doth he not make it after the conceived things; ſeeing he doth more and more ſwarve aſide from the ſimilitude of what is truely faire. Likewiſe he that maketh any thing after the example of things generated, ſhall never, as long namely as he doth fix his eyes upon them, attaine to what is perfectly beautifull; ſeeing the things generated are full of deformed diſproportions, and far remoted from the principall true beautie. Hence it is that</hi> Phidias, <hi>when he made</hi> Jupiter, <hi>did not caſt his eyes upon any thing generated, but he fetched the patterne of his worke out of a</hi> Jupiter <hi>conceived after</hi> Homers <hi>deſcription.</hi> Other famous Writers, beſides <hi>Proclus,</hi> doe alſo very much harp upon this ſtring, urging alwayes <hi>Phidias</hi> his example as an infallible rule of Art: and it ſeemeth by their words, that they held <hi>Phidias</hi> to be ſo excellent an Artificer, becauſe he had a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular abilitie to imagine things inviſible after a moſt maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall manner. <hi>Nothing is in my opinion ſo beautifull,</hi> ſayth <hi>Tullie</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">De perfecto oratore.</note>, <hi>but we muſt alwayes conceive that to be fairer from whence the former, even as an image was wont to be made after a face, is expreſſed; which cannot be perceived by our eyes, nor</hi>

                  <hi>eares, nor any of our ſenſes, ſince we doe apprehend it onely by thought and minde. Hence it is that we can imagine ſomething fairer yet then</hi> Phidias <hi>his images, although our eyes cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any thing fairer in that kinde. Neither did that ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, when he made the images of</hi> Jupiter <hi>and</hi> Minerva, <hi>fixe his eyes upon one after whom he ſhould draw ſuch a ſimilitude; but there did abide in his minde an exquiſite forme of beautie, upon the which he ſtaring, directed both his Art and his hand to the ſimilitude of the ſame. There is then in the forme and ſhape of things a certaine perfection and excellencie, unto whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived figure ſuch things by imitation are referred as cannot be ſeene.</hi> Plato, <hi>a moſt grave Author and teacher, not of knowing onely, but alſo of ſpeaking, doth call theſe figures Ideas.</hi> To this place of <hi>Tullie,</hi> wee muſt by all meanes adde the words of <hi>Seneca</hi> the Rhetorician; <hi>Phidias ſaw not Jupiter,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Lib. VIII. Contro.</hi> 2.</note>, <hi>when our mind fore-ſeeth and fore-caſteth the whole worke.

                     <hi>Lib.

Something elſe, replied</hi> Apollonius, <hi>and that full of wiſedome. What is that? ſayth</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:11347:15"/>
Theſpeſion <hi>againe; ſeeing you can, beſides the Imitation, name nothing. Phantaſie, anſwered</hi> Apollonius, <hi>hath accompliſhed theſe things; an Artificer farre exceeding Imitation in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for Imitation doth worke out nothing but what ſhee hath ſeene: Phantaſie on the contrary doth take in hand alſo what ſhee hath not ſeene; for ſhee propoundeth unto her ſelfe unknowne things with a relation to ſuch things as are. A certaine kinde of aſtoniſhment doth alſo often hinder our Imitation; whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can diſturbe the Phantaſie, being once reſolved to follow undauntedly what ſhee undertaketh. As for an Artificer that meaneth to conceive in his minde an image not unworthy of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, <hi>the ſame muſt ſee him accompanied with the foure ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the yeare, with the conſtellations, with the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for ſuch a one did</hi> Phidias <hi>then imagine. He likewiſe that doth intend to make an image wherein there might be perceived ſome reſemblance of</hi> Pallas, <hi>muſt ſee her with the looke ſhee hath at the marſhalling of great Armies, or when ſhe buſieth her ſelfe about devices of counſell and inventions of Art, yea he muſt propound her unto himſelfe as ſhee came gallantly leaping forth out of</hi> Jupiter <hi>his braine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. We doe ſee then plainly that the Artificers ſtand very much in need of the mentioned Imaginative facultie: and although wee muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe that they doe not ſo much want it, who content themſelves with the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of viſible things, following ſtroke after ſtroke; for the exerciſe of this ſame faculty doth more properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto ſuch Artificers as labour to be perfect, ſtudying alwayes by a continuall practiſe to enrich their Phantaſie with all kinde of perfect Images, and deſiring to have them in ſuch a readineſſe, that by them they might repreſent and reſemble things abſent, with the ſame facilitie others doe expreſſe things preſent: yet ſhall we more ſtrongly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11347:16"/>
of the neceſſitie of this ſame exerciſe, if we take this into our conſideration, that Artificers are often to expreſſe ſuch things as can but ſeldome, and that onely for a little while be ſeene; as namely, the burning of a Citie, of a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, or elſe of a company of ſcattered cottages; the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable confuſion of them that run their ſhip againſt a rock; the bloudy ſkirmiſh of a drunken mercileſſe crew, dying in a moſt horrid hurlie burlie on heaps. It is moſt certain that we doe but ſeldome meet with ſuch ſpectacles, neither doe they ſtay our leiſure to let us take a full view of them; all is but a flurt, and away. It is left therefore that our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould lay up carefully what ſhe hath ſeen, ſtill increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſtore with Images of things unſeene, as farre forth as it is poſſible to conceive them by a relation of what wee ſometimes beheld. <hi>What ſhall we doe,</hi> ſayth <hi>Seneca</hi> the rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>§ 4. It is then not onely profitable but alſo neceſſary, that an Artificer ſhould by a daily practice carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelfe of ſuch kinde of Images, as might be ready at his call when he is to imitate things abſent, and ſuch things as never came before his eyes: and <hi>wee ſhall with much eaſe attaine to this,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quintilian</hi>

                  <hi>minds, as if the doing of them kept us ſo buſie, and not the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſhall wee then not turne this ſame vice of our minde to a more profitable employment?</hi> Furthermore, ſayth the ſame Author in another place <note n="*" place="margin">

As for blunt and indocible wits, it is certaine that they are as little brought forth after the nature of man, as prodigious and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous bodies; but theſe are very few. It ſerveth for proofe, that there is moſt commonly in children a ſweet-promiſing hope of many things perceived; the which in proceſſe of time decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and periſhing, doth manifeſtly ſhew that there was no defect of nature in them, but onely want of care.</hi> It is then very well agreeing with nature, that we ſhould cheriſh and turne to the beſt that ſame aptneſſe which is in us to imagine ſtrange things: and we ſhall better be able to follow this exerciſe, if we doe now and then, having firſt baniſhed our ordinary cares, affect retired and ſolitary places; becauſe Phantaſie beſtirreth it ſelfe moſt, when round about us there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtirre to hinder our Imaginations: but ſeeing it is not alwayes in our power to meet with ſuch a retiredneſſe as is moſt of all, beſides the quietneſſe of our minde, to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet are we not upon the leaſt diſturbance inſtantly to give over the exerciſing of our Imaginations: for how ſhall we be able publikely in a crowd of many ſpectators, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the noiſe of many forward cenſurers to maintaine the ſinceritie and cleereneſſe of our judgement, if any little thing putteth us out? Wherefore <hi>we ſhall doe well at the firſt to ſtrive againſt all ſuch inconveniences,</hi> as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. Inſtit. lib. X. ca.</hi> 3.</note>, <hi>accuſtoming our minde to ſuch a ſtedfaſt conſtancy of conceiving, as to overcome all other impediments by the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe</hi>

                  <hi>of our intention: for if we do altogether bend this ſame intention upon the things conceived, our mind ſhall never take notice of any thing the eyes doe ſee, the eares doe heare. Doe not caſuall and ordinary deep thoughts bring many times to paſſe that we cannot ſee them that run full but upon us, and that we doe ſometimes ſtray from the way we are very well acquainted with? So is it then more likely that a purpoſed reſolution may doe the ſame. Neither are we to give way to all ſuch occaſions as may ſerve for an excuſe of ſlouthfulneſſe: for if we begin once to thinke that there is no time of ſtudying, but when we are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently refreſhed, merrily diſpoſed, and free from all other cares, we ſhall ever find ſome pretences of lazineſſe.

As many then as will not ſpend their labour and time in vaine, muſt not thinke it much to take ſome care and paines about the furniſhing of their mindes with all manner of profitable Images. <hi>Our wardrobes, when they are once filled up, can take no more,</hi> ſayth <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi>

He did likewiſe bethinke himſelfe that his enemies might come upon him in a battell aray ready to fight, or elſe meet him after a confuſed and diſorderly manner; ſo did he then conſider or enquire what place was fitteſt for him; how many armed men, and what kind of Armour (holding that point alſo conſiderable) there might be required for preſent uſe, where he ſhould beſtow the baggage, together with the unwarlike multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as alſo with what and how great a troupe he might guard them. Furthermore, did he looke about whether he had better march on in his way, or elſe goe backe the ſame way he came; where he ſhould lodge his Armie; how much ground his ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires ſhould aske; not neglecting in the meane time to ſpie out a convenience for watering, as alſo where his forces might have good ſtore of fodder and wood; which way and in what order he ſhould remove his campe the next day.

that deſire to be excellent in any Art. Wee are then by all meanes to bring a due and convenable preparation, as to all other Arts and Sciences, ſo likewiſe to theſe Arts of Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and although we cannot at all times and in all places draw and paint, our mind for all that can prepare it ſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and every where. <hi>Thankes be to God,</hi> ſayth <hi>Ovid</hi>

Thus made he as much haſte home as poſſibly could be made, confidently beleeving that upon the firſt ſight of his own mother he ſhould obtaine his deſire: but all in vaine; for the preſence of his mother changed him never a whit, and he was ſtill the ſame. He maketh afterwards upon one or other occaſion a journey towards the Iland <hi>Delus,</hi> view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about all what was worth ſeeing in ſo famous a place; and having met with a world of rare and memorable ſights, it came in his minde that among ſuch a number of rich and artificiall monuments confecrated unto <hi>Apollo,</hi> the ſtatue of his mother was like to be a ſingular good one.

               </p>
               <p>§ 2. Seeing then it cannot be denied, but that the firſt beginnings of Art have been very poore and imperfect, it appeareth likewiſe that they could not much be advanced by a bare Imitation: for although Imitation was able to bring a ſtudious Novice to ſuch grounds of Art as had been put in practice by them that were before him; yet for all that never could any Student, that did profeſſe himſelfe a meere Imitator, goe further then his predeceſſors had gone alreadie. And ſure it is that theſe Arts would alwayes have been at a ſtay, or rather growne worſe and worſe, if Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie had not ſupplied what Imitation could not performe. Wherefore it cannot be amiſſe to conſider here a little how unprofitable and hurtfull it is that we ſhould tie our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to a kinde of ſervile Imitation, without raiſing our thoughts to a more free and generous confidence. <hi>Such as never endeavour to ſtand upon their own legges,</hi> ſayth <hi>Seneca</hi>

It is in the meane time certaine that we ſhall finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if we doe content our ſelves with what was found alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. He likewiſe that followeth the ſteppes of any other man, doth even as much as if he did follow nothing at all; neither doth he find any thing, becauſe he doth not ſo much as ſeeke any thing.</hi> Marke alſo with us the following words of <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:11347:20"/>
                  <hi>Nothing,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">

X. ca.</hi> 2.</note>, <hi>doth receive any encreaſe by Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone; and, if it had been altogether unlawfull to adde any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing to the former, there ſhould be as yet no other Picture but ſuch a one as did at the firſt expreſſe the uttermoſt lines of the ſhadows which bodies make in the Sunne. If you doe runne over all the Arts, you ſhall find that no Art hath contained her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow bounds of her beginnings; neither have we any reaſon to thinke that theſe our times onely ſhould be ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as that nothing now can wax better: it is then requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that ſuch alſo as doe not covet to be the firſt, ſhould for all that rather ſtudy to outgoe then to follow: for he that ſtriveth to goe before, may by chance keepe an even pace with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, although he cannot out-run him; whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he can never keepe an even pace with any one whoſe ſteppes he meaneth moſt carefully to follow; ſeeing he that followeth, muſt needs be the laſt. So is it for the moſt part eaſier to doe more, then even juſt the ſame: for there is ſuch a difficultie in ſimilitude, that Nature it ſelfe hath never been able to bring to paſſe that things moſt like one unto another ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by one or other difference: beſides that whatſoever bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the ſimilitude of any other thing, muſt of neceſſitie come ſhort of the thing it doth reſemble; ſeeing the things we take for examples of our Imitation, doe contain in themſelves the true ſtrength and livelineſſe of Nature; the Imitation on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is ever fained and ſometimes alſo corrupted by ſome kind of forced affectation.</hi>

Having but now learned out of <hi>Quintilian,</hi> how ſmall profit the Novices of theſe Arts receive by meere I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, it followeth that we ſhould likewiſe obſerve out of the ſame judicious Writer, how great hurt new begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners receive by ſuch a ſlaviſh cuſtome of imitating: <hi>a great many,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>§ 4. Others perhaps may more be taken with ſome other of theſe alleadged places, the words of <hi>Syneſius</hi> run moſt of all in my mind, where he urgeth that things done by courſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11347:21"/>
of cuſtome muſt alwayes give place when there are found out things more profitable. Neither can I forbeare upon this occaſion to follow a little the ſteppes of the moſt wiſe and diſcreet <hi>Quintilian,</hi> ſeeing he diſputeth in ſundry paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages very much to our purpoſe. Some doe alwayes creepe neere the ground, for feare of falling; they do ſhunne and loath all delightfulneſſe in painting, allowing of nothing but what is plaine, meane, and without any endeavor. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can theſe weake and miſerable Artificers give the leaſt reaſon why ſuch dainties doe not agree with their palate; for what crime is there, I pray you, in a good Picture? doth it not advance the Art? doth it not commend the Artificer? doth it not move the ſpectator? All this cannot be denied: and therefore do they not plead any thing for themſelves, but that it is a way of painting not uſed by the Ancients. Whatſoever is not done after the example of Antiquitie, goeth againſt their ſtomackes. This pretence might ſeeme plauſible enough, if they did expreſſe what Antiquitie it is they appeale to: for it is not to be beleeved that they meane the firſt times of the newly invented Art: it being moſt certaine that <hi>Phydias</hi> and <hi>Apelles</hi> have brought many things to light, their predeceſſors knew nothing of: neither can any man think well of <hi>Praxiteles</hi> and <hi>Protogenes</hi> his works, that would have us follow the Art of <hi>Calamis</hi> and <hi>Polygno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> without varying from them in the leaſt ſtroke. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome of the ancient Maſters that came neerer the firſt times have followed a commendable kind of plain and ſure worke, yet have the following added unto this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theirs diverſe ornaments that did ſticke out in their workes, even as cleere ſhining eyes uſe to do in a faire face: but as bodies that are every where deckt with eyes, obſcure the beautie of the other members; ſo doe many Artificers
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11347:21"/>
now adayes drowne the pure brightneſſe of their Pictures with too much braverie: if then wee muſt needs follow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both, it is fit that we ſhould preferre the drineſſe of the Ancients before that ſame new licence our times have made choice of. But now need we not come to this, as to tie our Imitation to either of thoſe; ſeeing there is a certain middle way to be followed; even as to the firſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of food and apparell there hath been added an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproveable kinde of neatneſſe. The firſt for all that we are to obſerve, is, that wee ſtudie to avoide groſſe faults; leaſt in ſtead of being better then the Ancients, we ſhould onely be found unlike. <hi>Quintil. lib. VIII, cap.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>§ 5. As many then as deſire to expreſſe the principall vertues of the beſt and moſt approoved Artificers, muſt not content themſelves with a ſlender and ſuperficiall viewing of the workes they meane to imitate, but they are to take them in their hands againe and againe, never leaving till they have perfectly apprehended the force of Art that is in them, and alſo thoroughly acquainted themſelves with that ſpirit the Artificers felt whileſt they were buſie about theſe workes, it is not poſſible that out of a raſh and raw obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there ſhould ever ariſe a good and lively Imitation: even as we never uſe to ſwallow downe our meate, before it be ſufficiently chewed and almoſt melted in our mouthes, ſeeing this is the way to helpe our digeſtion, and to have it quickly turne into moſt wholeſome bloud. Wee muſt alſo for a great while imitate onely the beſt, and ſuch other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers as are like leaſt of all to deceive our truſt repoſed in them: but we are to doe it moſt adviſedly and carefully; becauſe it is often ſeene that the beſt Maſters doe purpoſely hide and conceale their owne vertues: neither may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thinke that all we do find in great Maſters is perfect:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11347:22"/>
for they ſlip ſometimes unawares, they yeeld and ſtoop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burthen, they cocker their forward wits too much, they are not alwayes attentive, otherwhile they grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alſo: they are the greateſt Artificers, but yet men: and it falleth out very often that ſuch as relie too much upon them, imitate for the moſt part what is worſt in their workes; thinking themſelves to be like enough, when they have onely expreſſed the vices of their much admired Maſters. Many things might be added to this point, neither ſhould we leave it ſo, if we did not eſteeme it more needfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a little what we have touched before; to wit, that ſuch things as doe deſerve to be moſt highly eſteemed in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, are almoſt inimitable; his wit, namely, his Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his unſtrained facilitie of working, and whatſoever can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taught us by the rules of Art <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quintil. x.</hi> 2</note>: ſo doe we alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no ſmall benefit out of the hardneſſe of this matter, ſeeing the conſideration of this ſame difficultie doth adviſe us to looke ſomewhat neerer into the workes of excellent Artificers; neither can we reſolve to run any more with a quick eye careleſly over them after we have once perfectly underſtood the great force of their vertues by the pains we are to take before we can either underſtand or imitate them aright. <hi>Quintil. X.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>§ 6. We are then to obſerve here two things: the firſt is that we make a good choice of the Artificers we meane to imitate; ſeeing many doe propound themſelves the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the worſt: the ſecond is that we do likewiſe conſider what we are moſt of all to imitate in the choſen Artificers; ſeeing we doe meet alſo with ſome blame-worthy things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the beſt Artificers: and it were to be wiſhed, that we did as well hit their vertues better, as wee uſe to expreſſe their vices a great deal worſe. As for them that want no
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11347:22"/>
judgement to diſcerne and to ſhun the faults of great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, it is not enough they ſhould expreſſe a vaine and forceleſſe ſhadow of ſuch vertues as are moſt of all admired in others; for our Imitation is then onely to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when it doth after a moſt lively manner ſet forth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular the true force of the work imitated: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as raſh and inconſiderate beginners fall to worke upon the firſt ſight, before ever they have ſounded the deep and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſteries of Art, pleaſing themſelves wonderfully with the good ſucceſſe of their Imitation, when they ſeeme one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the outward lines and colours to come ſomewhat neere their paterne: and therefore doe they never attaine to that power of Art the originalls have, but they doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decline to the worſt; embracing not the vertues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but their neighbour vices: they are puffed up, not ſtately; ſtarved, not delicate; temerary, not confident; wanton, not delectable; negligent, not plaine: the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of them that goe about to imitate the moſt ancient pieces by a dry and hard manner of painting, may ſerve us here for an inſtance; ſeeing they doe onely expreſſe the outward ſhew of ſimplicity, never regarding what treaſures of Art there lie hidden under this ſame ſober and temperat way, uſed by the ancient Maſters. <hi>Quintil. X,</hi> 2. To be ſhort; a good Imitator ſtandeth in need of learned and well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed eyes; not onely, becauſe hidden things cannot be ſeen unleſſe they are firſt ſearched out; but alſo, becauſe the things apparant are very often ſo cunningly contrived and joyned, that none but quick-ſighted Artificers and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers can perceive them. And this is the true reaſon why theſe Arts doe alwayes at the firſt require the helpe of a faithfull Maſter, who may ſincerely acquaint us with ſuch things as deſerve to be imitated, who may teach us, who

may mend what is done amiſſe, who may direct us, who may informe us by what ſhew of diſſimilitude the ſimilitude of things neerely reſembling is to be concealed: for a good I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitator muſt by all meanes be a concealer of his Art, and it is ſomewhat too childiſh to follow the ſame ſtrokes and lineaments in all things. Though now in the opinion of ſome it may be held a praiſe-worthy thing to expreſſe <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> his <hi>Venus, Anadyomene</hi> or <hi>Protogenes</hi> his Satyr, &amp; though in their judgement it deſerveth no blame to fit our workes ſo accurately with the ſame colours and ſhadows, that they may ſeeme to come neereſt unto the ſimilitude of ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely accompliſhed patternes; it is for all that a greater matter to expreſſe in <hi>Achilles</hi> his picture the very ſame Art which was by <hi>Apelles</hi> repreſented in the picture of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Wee muſt therefore endeavour firſt of all that there ſeeme not to be any ſimilitude; and if there appeareth any, our ſecond care muſt be that it may ſeeme to be done pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely: which is the worke onely of learned and well-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Artificers: and is then chiefly to be done, when by a moſt laudable contention they doe hunt after a certain grace of hidden ſimilitude in ſuch things as ſhould be like in nothing but in the manner of handling.</p>
               <p>§ 7. It is then required here that we ſhould not onely bend our naturall deſire of Imitation towardes the beſt things, but that we ſhould likewiſe ſtudy to underſtand wherein the excellency of the ſame things doth conſiſt: the which having diligently performed, we ſhall by the ſame meanes perceive how neceſſary it is that we ſhould duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our owne abilitie and ſtrength, before we undertake the Imitation of ſuch workes as doe excell in all kinde of rare and curious perfections. There offer themſelves almoſt in every good Picture many things hard to be expreſſed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11347:23"/>
not onely becauſe they are beyond our power, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo becauſe there is in us a certaine unableneſſe of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitating ſuch things as do not very well agree with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition: for every one hath within his own breſt a certaine law of nature, the which he may not neglect; ſo are alſo the moſt ill-favoured and graceleſſe Pictures moſt commonly wrought by them that venture upon any thing without conſidering to what their naturall inclination doth lead them moſt of all: neither can it be otherwiſe but noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious groſſe errours ſhall be committed by him that having but an ordinary wit, meaneth to buſie himſelfe about the imitation of things onely commendable for the ſtrength of wit contained in them: contrariwiſe ſuch as have an unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med force of wit, and conſequently a bold and audacious readineſſe of hand, are like to ſpoyle both themſelves and their worke, if they endeavour to imitate pieces done by them that bring a ſoft and gentle hand to the inventions proceeding out of a milde nature: ſoft things are ſo warily to be mingled with things that have a certain kind of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that we doe not overthrow both the vertues by an unadviſed confuſion: and it hath ever been eſteemed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming and foule miſtake, to expreſſe tender and delicate things after a harſh and rough manner. Out of all this are we moreover to obſerve that it is an unadviſed thing to tie our Imitation to one Maſter alone, though never ſo great: ſeeing there is not one among a thouſand whoſe conceits and manner of worke doe altogether agree with our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and temper. <hi>Apelles</hi> was queſtionleſſe the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat among all the other Artificers, yet have ſome of the old ones excelled him in one or other particular qualitie: and although in his workes is to be found what is moſt lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, nevertheleſſe did not the ancients judge that he who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11347:24"/>
moſt of all was to be followed, was alſo to be followed <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and in all things. What then? is it not enough to do all things as <hi>Apelles</hi> did? certainly, there is good reaſon why we ſhould thinke it ſufficient if we knew how to attaine to it: but ſeeing it is not poſſible that any one man ſhould come ſo neere him as to expreſſe all ſuch vertues as by a peculiar inſtinct were proper unto him, ſo can it doe no hurt to adde to that ſame highly eſteemed grace of his the ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full audacitie of <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> the infatigable diligence of <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> the witty ſubtiltie of <hi>Timanthes,</hi> the ſtately magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of <hi>Nicophanes.</hi> For as it is the part of a wiſe man to borrow of every one what he knoweth beſt to agree with his own naturall inclination, ſo is it ſeldome or never ſeene that the workes of one man ſhould fit our humour in all things; ſeeing alſo that it is not permitted us to expreſſe one Maſter in every particular, it ſeemeth to be a very good courſe that we ſhould fix our attentiveneſſe upon the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of ſeverall great Maſters, to the end that ſomething out of the one and ſomething out of the other might ſticke to us. <hi>Quintil. X.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>§ 8. What wee have propunded already is of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as that it deſerveth to be repeated againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: neither doe we care what others thinke on it, ſeeing we are upon good grounds perſwaded that the true follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a rare Maſters Art, doth not conſiſt in an apiſh Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the outward ornaments, but rather in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the inward force. It concerneth us therefore not a little to marke narrowly what a ſingular Grace the old Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers have expreſſed in their works, what hath been their intent, what cunning and circumſpect diſcretion they doe ſhew in their diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how likewiſe the very ſame things that might ſeeme to be onely for recreation, prepare them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11347:24"/>
a ready way to an everlaſting fame: till wee have rightly ſearched and underſtood every one of theſe things, it is to very ſmall purpoſe that we ſhould goe about any ſuch thing as to imitate the old deſervedly renowned maſters. If any one on the contrary can ad ſo much to theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to make up what lacketh in the ancient Artificers, and likewiſe to detract what is ſuperfluous in them, him ſhall wee eſteem to be that ſame long looked for, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Artiſt, the which beſides a great many other commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, ſhall not only be ſaid to have deprived the former ages of the enjoying of ſuch a glory, but he ſhall ſeem alſo to have ſnatched away from the following ages the very hope of ſo glorious a title. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Quintil.

               </p>
               <p>§. 9. Having therefore underſtood out of the former words of <hi>Quintilian,</hi> that a perfect Artiſt is to joyne to this care of Imitation all the vertues hee hath of his owne, wee are by this warning, as by a hand brought back againe to that point from which we did ſomewhat digreſſe, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our ſelves in a manner compelled to approve of the moſt learned <hi>Varro</hi> his judgement. <hi>Apelles, Protogenes, and other excellent Artificers deſerve no blame,</hi> ſaith he, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:11347:25"/>
have judged it in them a renouncing and forſwearing of witte and diſcretion, if the prime ſpirits of the world had preferred the love of a blame-worthie conſuetude before better inventions. It is cleere then, what ſingular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit wee doe receive, and how much theſe Artes are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a well-ordered Imagination; for it is brought to paſſe by her meanes that the moſt lively and forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Artificers, leaving the barren and fruitleſſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of an ordinarie Imitation, give their minds to a more couragious boldneſſe; and ſcorning themſelves any more to be tied to ſuch a ſlaviſh kinde of Imitation, they ſtirre up their free'd ſpirits to goe further then others have done before them: <hi>every Arte,</hi> ſaith <hi>Epictetus,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 10. There is then queſtionleſſe ſome Perfection of Arte to bee attained unto; neither may wee thinke it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that wee as well as any body elſe can attaine to it; and although the higheſt ſtep of perfection were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us, yet are they likelyer to lift themſelves up higher who reſolve to ſtrive and to take paines, then ſuch as at the firſt beginning are driven backe by a faint-hearted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire: <hi>an open field is fitter for Art,</hi> ſaith <hi>Quintilian,</hi>

                  <hi>therefore were wont to adorne ſuch parlours as were for the ſpring and harveſt time, ſuch porches alſo and long entries as were for Summer, with all kinde of Pictures drawne out of the certaine truth of things naturall. But thoſe examples taken by the Ancients out of true things, are now by reaſon of our corrupt manners utterly diſliked: ſeeing in our plaiſterings there are rather monſters painted, then any certaine images of limited things: and yet doe not men, when they ſee ſuch falſe things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them, but they doe much more take delight in them: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they marke whether any ſuch thing can be, or not: the weakneſſe of their judgement hath ſo darkened their wits, that they cannot examine what the authoritie and reaſon of decencie demandeth: for ſuch Pictures are not to be liked, as doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the truth: and if they are made neat and fine by Art, yet muſt wee not inſtantly approve of them, unleſſe wee doe finde in them ſome certaine kinde of arguments free from all offence.</hi> Now as the Artificer may not abuſe the libertie of his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, by turning it unto a licentious boldneſſe of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying things abhorring from Nature; ſo muſt alſo a right lover of Art preferre a plaine and honeſt worke agreeing with Nature before any other phantaſtically capricious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath very well obſerved this; <hi>There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at Rome,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">De Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note>, <hi>which doe nothing at all care for good Pictures and Statues, but a man may finde them alwayes upon the monſter-market, where they ſtand and ſtare upon ſuch mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med creatures as want either legges or armes, as have three eyes or heads of Oſtriches, and if there be any other hideous deteſtable deformitie: but although at the firſt they ſeeme very much to be taken with ſuch kind of ſpectacles, yet will they ſoone have their fill on them, yea they will loath them, if you bring them often before their eyes.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11347:27"/>
vulgar ſort that <hi>Painters</hi> as well as <hi>Poets</hi> have an unlimited, libertie of deviſing; for if we doe but marke what <hi>Horace</hi> telleth us in the firſt entrance of his booke written about the <hi>Poeticall Art,</hi> wee ſhall confeſſe that neither <hi>Poets</hi> nor <hi>Painters</hi> may take ſuch a libertie as to ſtuffe up their workes with all kind of frivolous and lying conceits. <hi>Lactantius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath obſerved this point very well; <hi>men doe not know,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">

Thus doe we then in the next Chapter goe about this point: once for all admoniſhing, that under the name of <hi>Painters,</hi> all ſuch Artificers are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, as doe any manner of way practiſe any of the other Arts of that nature.</p>

Compare therefore Nature with the materiall, and Art with Doctrine: the one doth worke, the other is wrought upon:</hi>

                  <hi>Art can doe nothing without the materiall; whereas the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall without Art hath her own worthineſſe. So is then the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Art together with the beſt materiall to be deſired.</hi> Theſe words of <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſhould content us here, if the ſame judicious Writer did not urge in another place a point more to be marked; for ſeeing that in the workes of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Artificers, their decent Grace is moſt of all to be had in admiration, ſo are we moreover in this ſame Grace to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a great difference of Natures: <hi>There is in this point ſome hidden and unſpeakable reaſon,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quintilian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Sub finem libri unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimi orat. inſtitut.</note>, <hi>and as it is truely ſayd, that it is the principall point in Art to be comely in what we doe; ſo can this comelineſs for all that not be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Art, neither can it altogether be procured by Art: in ſome Artificers vertues are not pleaſing; in ſome on the contrary vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces themſelves are gracefull. Wee have ſeene</hi> Demetrius <hi>and</hi> Stratocles, <hi>great actors of Comedies, how they were liked for ſeverall vertues. But this was not ſo wonderfull, that the one knew better how to act Gods, modeſt young men, good fathers, ſober ſervants, grave matrones and old women: the other got greater commendations by acting ſharpe old men, ſhrewd ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, inſinuating paraſites, wily bawdes, and all ſuch parts as did require ſome noiſe and ſtirre: this then was not ſo ſtrange I ſay, ſeeing</hi> Demetrius <hi>had alſo a ſweeter voice, whereas</hi> Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocles <hi>his voice was more vehement.

                  <hi>occaſions of the part he played did require; ſeeing he did this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to gratifie the people, as knowing well enough how the vulgar ſort was taken with it; and if</hi> Demetrius <hi>had gone about any ſuch thing, it would have made a moſt ill-favoured ſhew.

homeward comming from a drink-feaſt, and that not at the ſetting, but at the riſing of the Sunne, ſaw <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the Philoſopher his doore open: and though he was deepe in drinke, beſmeared with oyntments, having his head beſet with garlands, clad in a thin and ſoft garment, yet did not he ſticke to enter into the Philoſophers ſchoole, that was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a multitude of learned men: neither contenting himſelfe with ſuch a foule entrance, he ſate downe alſo, to the end that he might mocke that ſame rare eloquence and the moſt wiſe Precepts, with the ſottiſh fopperies of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe.

               <p>§ 6. Both are moſt of all advanced by the ready help of a ſtrong and well-exerciſed Imagination: <hi>the Art of Painting,</hi> ſayth the younger <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In prooemio Iconum.</note>, <hi>is found to be a kin to Poëſie; ſeeing both do therein agree, that as well the one as the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a forward Phantaſie. The Poëts bring the preſence of the Gods upon a ſtage, and all what is pompous, grave, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The Painters likewiſe doe deſigne as many things upon a boord, as the Poets poſſibly can utter.</hi> So doth then the <hi>Art of Painting</hi> as well as <hi>Poeſie</hi> relie upon a generous and bold ſtrength of Imagination, ſo that they will no more creepe and crawle to feele and to follow the ſteppes of them that are gone before, but they take upon themſelves to trie it ſomewhat further, if by chance they might be eſteemed worthy to lead others the way. The <hi>Poëts</hi> impelled by the ſudden heate of a thoroughly ſtirred Phantaſie, or rather tranſported as by a propheticall traunce, doe cleerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the round rings of prettily dancing Nymphs, together with the ambuſhes of lurking lecherous Satyrs: they ſee all kinde of armour and unbridled horſes with their toſſed and tottered waggons; the ſhape of one or other God doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times runne in their minde, yea they doe very often eſpie the ſnaky-headed Furies tearing their own heads and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting a hand-full of hiſſing ſerpents into the faces of ill-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bloud-thirſtie men. <hi>The Poëticall phantaſies,</hi> ſayth one in <hi>Plutarch</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Erotico.</note>, <hi>in regard of their perſpicuitie, are like dreames of them that are awake.</hi> With <hi>Poëts</hi> howſoever ſo it is, that their minds being once in agitation cannot containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any longer, but out it muſt whatſoever they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:11347:35"/>
it is not poſſible for them to reſt, untill they have eaſed their free ſpirit of ſuch a burden, powring out the fulneſſe of their jolly conceits by ſtrange fetches of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, by the unexpected miniſtery of a favourable God, and a thouſand other fabulous inventions. When <hi>Ovid</hi> doth deſcribe that ſame temerary ladde that fooliſhly longed to tread upon his Fathers fiery chariot, would you not thinke then that the Poët ſtepping with <hi>Phaëton</hi> upon the waggon hath noted from the beginning to the endievely particular accident which could fall out inſuch a horrible confuſion? neither could he ever have conceived the leaſt ſhadow of this dangerous enterpriſe, if he had not been as if it were preſent with the unfortunate youth: he beholdeth firſt the impatient horſes ſtanding as yet within the barres, how by treading and trampling they do ſpend before the race thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and thouſand ſteppes to no purpoſe: afterwards doth he ſee the vaine ſtripling skip upon the waggon, and with a brave undaunted looke drive on, till the fierce winged beaſts perceiving the impotency of their new Maſter throw the unexperienced waggoner headlong downe with wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon and all. But ſeeing it would be a very hard taſke for me, yea and too much arrogancy in me that I ſhould ſtrive to expreſſe any part of the abundance of conceit the ancient Poëts had, I muſt needs remit the ſtudious Reader to <hi>Ovid</hi> himſelfe, for whoſoever doth but marke how <hi>Ovid</hi> goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fable of <hi>Phaëton;</hi> and how other Poëts likewiſe do handle other matters in that kinde, he ſhall queſtionleſſe both with pleaſure and profit underſtand what vehement and ſenſible Imaginations they have followed; and that without ſuch a force of phantaſie the whole labour of their braines will be but a heavie, dull, and life-leſſe piece of worke. <hi>Painters</hi> in like manner doe fall to their worke
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11347:36"/>
invited and drawne on by the tickling pleaſure of their nimble Imaginations; for lighting upon ſome Poëticall or Hiſtoricall argument, ſometimes alſo upon an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought out by their owne Phantaſie, they doe firſt of all paſſe over every circumſtance of the matter in hand, conſidering it ſeriouſly, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the doing, or ſaw it acted before their eyes: whereupon feeling themſelves well filled with a quick and lively imagination of the whole worke, they make haſte to eaſe their overcharged braines by a ſpeedie pourtraying of the conceit. It is then in vaine an Artificer ſhould hope to be both powerfull and perſpicuous, unleſſe he doe alwayes propound unto himſelfe the worke in hand as if all were preſent, and that principally when he is to expreſſe any thing wherein he meeteth with ſome notable Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Paſſions of the minde: <hi>for ſeeing that theſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times true, ſometimes fuinell and imitated,</hi> ſaith <hi>Quintilian,</hi>

                  <hi>ſo falleth it out that the true ones doe breake forth naturally, as wee ſee in the Paſſions of them that conceive any griefe, or anger; or indignation; but they want Art; and therefore are they to befaſhioned and directed by diſcipline: contrarywiſe the Paſſions imitated have Art, but want nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it here a maine point, to have a true feeling of them, rightly to conceive the true images of things, and to be mooved with them, as if they were rather true then imagined:</hi> ſo are then theſe commotions of our mind by all means to be drawne out of the truth of nature: and it ſtandeth an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer upon it, rather to trie all what may be tried, then to marre the vigorous force of a freſh and warme Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ſlow and coole manner of Imitation: the player <hi>Polus</hi> practiſed this in another occaſion very fitly, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act at <hi>Athens</hi> atragedie of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> in the which hee

As manie therefore as reſolve to follow this ſame contemplation earneſtly, doe ſometimes purpoſely take certaine Images of things conceived, and turne them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes, even as one lumpe of waxe uſeth to be wrought and altered into a hundred ſeverall faſhions and ſhapes: but principally do they labor to ſtore up in their Phantaſie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11347:38"/>
the moſt compleat Images of beautie. Such Artificers as worke in braſſe and colours receive out of the naturall things themſelves thoſe notions by the which they do imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the outward lineaments, light, ſhadows, riſings, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; they pick out of every particular body the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent marks of true beautie, and beſtow them upon ſome one body: ſo that they ſeem not to have learned of Nature, but to have ſtrived with her, or rather to have ſet her a law. For who is there, I pray you, that can ſhew us ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat beautie of any woman, but a quick-ſighted Judge will eaſily find in her ſomthing wherein ſhe may be eſteemed to come ſhort of true perfection? For although the whole ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſſe of perfection doth conſiſt in the rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of Nature; yet doth the commixtion of both parents, the conſtitution of the place, aire, and ſeaſon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often detract ſomthing from the naturall forme: ſeeing then that Artificers themſelves doe not borrow the Image or patern of a moſt excellent beautie from one particular worke of Nature; ſo is it likewiſe requiſite, that Lovers and Well-willers of Art ſhould not content themſelves with the contemplation of any one particular body, but that they ſhould rather caſt their eyes upon ſeverall bodies more exactly made by Nature, obſerving in them the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of age, ſexe, condition: and you ſhall ſeldome ſee them reſt here, but they will fixe their eyes alſo upon many other naturall bodies, ſtudying alwayes to enrich their Phantaſie with lively impreſſions of all manner of things. They doe marke the wide heaven beſet with an endleſſe number of bright and glorious ſtarres; the watery clouds of ſeverall colours, together with the miraculouſly painted raine-bow; how the great Lampe of light up-rearing his flaming head above the earth, cauſeth the dawning day to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:11347:39"/>
ſpread a faint and trembling light upon the flichering gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded waves; how the fiery glimmering of that ſame glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye of the world, being leſſened about noon-tide, leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſhadowes of all things; how darkſome night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to diſplay her coal-black curtain over the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſkie, dimming the ſpacious reach of heaven with a ſhady dampe: they obſerve likewiſe the unacceſſable height of the mountaines, with their ridge ſomtimes extended a good way, ſomtimes cut off ſuddenly by a craggie and ſteep abruptneſſe; pleaſant arbors and long rowes of lofty trees, clad with ſummers pride, and ſpreading their claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armes in wanton intricate wreathings; thick woods, graced between the ſtumpes with a pure and graſſe-greene ſoile, the beames of the Sunne here and there breaking thorough the thickeſt boughes, and diverſly enlightning the ſhadie ground: gently ſwelling hillocks; plaine fields; rich meadowes; divers flowers ſhining as earthly ſtarres; fountaines guſhing forth out of a main rock, ſweet brooks running with a ſoft murmuring noiſe, holding our eyes open with their azure ſtreames, and yet ſeeking to cloſe our eyes with the purling noiſe made among the pebble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones; low and ſmoakie villages; ſtately cities, taking pride in the turrets of their walls, and threatning the cloudes with the pinnacles of their ſpear-like ſteeples. They doe conſider in Lions, horſes, eagles, ſnakes, and all other creatures, wherein the abſolute perfection of their ſhapes doth conſiſt: propounding unto themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe parliaments, ſacrifices, feſtivall meetings and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, huſbandrie-worke, ſmiths forges, foot-men run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a race, fiſhers, ſailers putting off from the ſhore, or elſe landing, faire and foul weather, the ſea calme and boiſterous, great armies of men, depopulations of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:11347:39"/>
countrie, ſurpriſings of cities, and whatſoever uſeth to fall out in an expugnation of a great and populous towne: whole troupes of armed men, having broake up the citie gates, and throwne downe a good part of the walls, run through the towne after a moſt tumultuous manner, and cauſe every where a trepidation like unto a ruine, whileſt with ſword and fire they do promiſcuouſly deſtroy things ſacred and profane: the crackling noiſe in the meane time of the houſes that are a pulling downe doth encreaſe the feare: the crie alſo out of the ſeverall voices of them that doe fright and are frighted, the noiſe of rumbling drummes and ſhrill trumpets, the ſhouting of them that doe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the wailing of them that are overcome, together with the weeping of women and children, one ſound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up out of divers clamours, doth confound all: and yet ſeemeth all this lamentable noiſe to be deafned by the ſhrieking and howling of ſuch mothers as are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to have their tender infants ſnatched out of their armes, as alſo by the flocking together of great companies of diſtreſſed women, that running ſometimes after one ſometimes after another doe nothing but aſke their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, brothers, ſonnes, what deſtinies they doe meane to leave them to, there being every where nothing elſe to be ſeen but cruell deſolation, griefe, feare, and a certaine image of preſent death and deſtruction: the ſight of the publike calamitie is of ſeverall ſorts, uncertaine, foule, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid: the conquerers ſhew themſelves to be conquered by ſeverall luſts, every one thinking it lawfull whatſoever hee hath a mind to, and none of them all holding any thing unlawfull: no dignitie, no age can hinder them but that they will adde rapes to murders, and murders to rapes: the armed men, and all ſuch as be of age to beare armes,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11347:40"/>
are cut in pieces: brothers and ſiſters are pulled aſunder whilſt they doe ruſh to take their leaves by a mutuall and never more looked for embracement: aged men unto whom it had been happier to have met with a timely death, old decayed women alſo in whom there is left nothing a greedy and luſtfull enemy ſhould prey upon, are haled and pulled for meere ſport: and if there falleth by chance a ripe virgin into the hands of the inſolent conquerours, ſhee is in danger to be torne in pieces by them, till they among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the eagernes of ſtriving fall together by the eares, not ſo much as perceiving that another company of raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cometh upon them readie both to diſpatch them and to carry the maid violently away: ſome deſpiſing the things that are alreadie in their power, goe about to finde out by wounding and tormenting the owners what they ſuppoſe to be concealed; they ſearch every darke hole and ſecret corner, with burning torches in their hands; leaſt, having carried out all the ſpoile, they ſhould want ready meanes to ſet the emptied houſes a-fire. You cannot caſt your eyes any where, but you ſhall meet with whole droves of chained captives: the ſtreets are every where ſtrawed over with packes contemned by avarice in compariſon of ſome better things it met withall by the way: armed, unarmed, boyes, horſes, weapons, men, women, houſhold-ſtuffe, enemies, citizens, all are mixed together: nothing is done by advice and counſell. Fortune carrieth the greateſt ſway: the ſad aſpect of the fatall houre cannot but moove the hearts of ſome angry conquerors to compaſſion; whileſt others wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with ſlaughters ſet themſelves downe, the occaſions to exerciſe their anger upon, and not their anger, failing them; for they doe ſtill looke about with a ſterne countenance, if they could eſpie any frighted ſoules come neere them by an
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11347:40"/>
unprovident flight: but the greater part of them being growne ſenſeleſſe by the horrible fight of fire and murders, can neither ſee, nor heare, nor forecaſt any thing; their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate agonies alſo being ſtupified by the publike calamities, they exſpect the enemy in their owne houſes, being obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſolved to die in the middeſt of the deareſt delights of their life: the moſt valiant in the mean time having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their courage with a generous deſperation doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the thickeſt throngs of the incenſed enemies by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and offering their own naked throats unto them; and being once thoroughly enraged with the laſt madneſſe of dying men, whereſoever the fight taketh them, there they do reſiſt, content yea deſirous to die in the revenge of their ruinated Country: ſome that meane to ſcape, runne into their own death and deſtruction: others that would faine renew the fight, are againſt their wills carried away by the violence of a flying multitude. Thus leaving their ſweet home where they were borne and bred, they cannot but ſometimes ſtay a little and look about, very loath to part; neither ſhould they have any power to ſtirre one foot from the place, unleſſe feare of having their throats cut did make them underſtand that they had beſt, the publike miſeries being paſt redreſſe, ſteale away and follow their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, their private hopes, without looking after any guide or any conſent of deſolate multitudes: they meet at length in the gates, where they are heaped one upon another, a great number of them being throwne downe not onely by ſlaughter and a faint wearineſſe of fighting and running, but alſo by crowding and ſtriving to get out firſt: men and horſes, wounded and unwounded, living and dead, ſwords and pikes, bundles alſo of precious things make all but one heape ſtopping up the gates: neither doe the others that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11347:41"/>
follow, beare ſo much reſpect either to the living or dead, but that they tread and trample upon them to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away: without the gates there is a ſad and miſerable company of them that are ſcaped to be ſeen, filling the wayes with a dolefullamentation, as if but now they had got ſome leiſure to be waile their own miſfortunes, the ſight of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflicted ones provoking teares by a mutuall miſeration. But here alſo preſenteth it ſelfe in the open fields a great and fearefull ſpectacle: ſome fierce conquerours, not abiding any ſhould ſcape, are inſtantly at their heeles, perſecuting, wounding, taking and killing them they tooke when others were offered: there lie every where ſcattered upon the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ground all manner of weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, dead bodies, whole joynts cut off: and whereſoever valour and anger reentring into the minds of ſome of the conquered, cauſe them to diſdaine that a few by ſo hot a purſuit ſhould drive them like ſheep, there is for a ſhort while a deſperate fight manfully maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; till they ſee more and ſtronger bands of enemies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching: for then do they begin to leave their anger, and remembring their preſent fortunes they do take their flight, running with one breath unto remote and unacceſſible pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; not in great troupes, as before, but every one by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, yea purpoſely ſhunning one another, leaſt their flocking and running together ſhould ſtill draw the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies after them.</p>
               <p>§ 3. It appeareth now what care the well-willers of Art uſe to take about the exerciſing &amp; preparing of their phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, ſeeing they do by a moſt accurat Imagination deſigne and make up in their mindes the compleat pictures of all kind of naturall things; and being thus provided, they doe very often examine the works of great Artificers with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe then the Artiſts themſelves, the ſeveritie and

               <p>§. 4. Although now a man doth not at the firſt bring to theſe Arts ſufficiently exerciſed eyes, yet is he not inſtantly to be excluded from the moſt delicate contemplation of Art; ſeeing a man altogether unſkilfull in ſuch curioſities, may very well feel the delight of them, though he cannot give an exact account of his liking. <hi>The vertue and grace ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in all the worke,</hi> ſayth <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis</hi>

It is verily a great matter to exerciſe an Art to the which our naturall inclination leadeth us; as before hath been ſhewed: and yet is it of no leſſe moment to begin that ſame ſelfe-choſen Art betimes. <hi>This is true in my opinion,</hi> ſayth <hi>Tullie</hi>

Whereas, if they would be content that the endeavours of their children ſhould goe on by degrees, that the ſtudious lads ſhould be kept in by a ſtrict courſe of exercitation, that they ſhould prepare their mindes by the precepts of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they ſhould not ſticke now and then with a cruell pencill to deface pleaſing lineaments, that they ſhould view and conſider a great while what may be worthy their imitation, if they did not inſtantly thinke all magnificent whatſoever they ſee liked by their children, this ſame mightie Art could never want the weight of her majeſtie. Now on the contrary, as boys doe but trifle and play in the ſchooles, ſo are they nothing but laught at, when they ſtep forth unto the publike: and, which is worſe then both, whatſoever any one being young hath learned amiſſe, he is loathe to confeſſe it when he groweth older.</hi>

§ 13. After a ſufficient relation of many workes of Art, wee may not forget here the ſeverall coines of money, a thing moſt needfull for the commerce of Nations. And what is money, I pray you, but <hi>ſilver cut in ſmall faces and titles,</hi> as <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Satyrâ</hi> xiv, <hi>verſ.</hi> 291. Thoſe that know how to diſcerne the ſeverall ſorts of coines judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, finde a wonderfull difference between the monies coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the times when theſe Arts of imitation did flouriſh, and when they were neglected: and they doe eſteeme it a moſt eaſie thing to know by the money, what forwardneſſe or backwardneſſe of Art there was in the times that money was coined. But among many moſt accurat ſorts of coine anciently famous, the <hi>Cyziceni ſtateres</hi> were moſt of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, as being well ſtamped: they had a womans face on the one ſide, and the fore-part of a Lion on the other ſide: ſee <hi>Heſychius</hi> and <hi>Suidas;</hi> as alſo <hi>Zenobius</hi> and <hi>Diogenianus</hi> parmiographers.</p>

eſtimation of ſuch a Judge, if they did any thing worth his ſight.</p>
               <p>§ 2. That great and eminent men in ancient times were very ſkilfull in theſe Arts, may be gathered out of that love and reſpect the Artificers enjoyed. <hi>It is by a naturall vice grafted and rooted in the breſts of men, that ſuch as doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Arts, doe not admire the Artificers,</hi> ſayth <hi>Sidoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Apollinaris lib.</hi> v, <hi>epiſt.</hi> 10. <hi>Vertues are obſcured by reaſon of the ignorance of Art,</hi> ſayth <hi>Vitruvius in prooemio libri Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii.</hi> Seeing then that excellent Artificers thinke themſelves to be placed upon a Theater, where nothing heateth their forward ſpirits ſo much as the aſtoniſhed acclamations and applauſes of all ſorts of men, it was no wonder that many did excell in thoſe times when Kings with their Peeres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to the ſhops of Painters, kindling in the hearts of the Artificers an unſpeakable deſire to have this glory ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and encreaſed. <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Poliorcetes,</hi> whileſt he was at the ſiege of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> did not ſtick to come to <hi>Protogenes,</hi> who was then buſie with the picture of <hi>Jaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>leaving the hope of his victory, he beheld the Artificer in the midſt of hoſtill weapons and batterings of the wall,</hi> as <hi>Plinie</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>lib. xxxv, cap.</hi> 10. ſee that copious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelfe.

                  <hi>beautie, ſhould be painted naked by</hi> Apelles; <hi>he gave her unto</hi> Apelles, <hi>when he perceived him to be as deepe intangled in the love of the woman as he found himſelfe to be: great was his minde, and yet was the conquering of his owne luſt greater: wherefore hath he likewiſe been as much eſteemed for this deed, as for any other victorie; ſeeing he overcame himſelfe in this. Neither did he give his bed onely to the Artificer, but his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo: not ſo much as ſuffering himſelfe to be moved with the reſpect of his beloved, but rather giving way that ſhee who had beene a Kings concubine, ſhould now be the concubine of a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Out of the like reſpect of Art came it to paſſe, that <hi>the ſame King, to leave a truer image unto poſteritie, would not have his image by many Artificers promiſcuouſly defiled; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a proclamation thorough all his Dominions, that no bodie ſhould unadviſedly undertake to expreſſe his image in braſſe, in colours, or in any engraved worke; but that</hi> Polycletus <hi>alone ſhould caſte him in braſſe,</hi> Apelles <hi>alone ſhould paint him in colours,</hi> Pyrgoteles <hi>alone ſhould engrave him: beſides theſe three, who were moſt famous for their workmanſhip, if any one was found any where to meddle with the ſacred image of the King, he ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed for his ſacrilegious attempt. The feare therefore of this edict brought to paſſe, that</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>his image was every where the prime image; and that in all ſtatues, pictures, and engravings there was to be ſeene the ſame vigour of a moſt vehement warrier, the ſame markes of the greateſt dignitie, the ſame livelineſſe of his freſh youth, the ſame grace of his high forehead.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11347:96"/>
their workes were priſed at. It is knowne that a picture of <hi>Bularchus</hi> the Painter was valued at the weight of it in gold by <hi>Candaules</hi> King of Lydia: ſo much was the Art even in thoſe times eſteemed, <hi>Plin. lib.</hi> xxxv, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the Thebane painted a battell fought with the Perſians, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were an hundred figures, and he agreed with <hi>Mnaſon</hi> the tyrant of the Eleatenſes to receive ten minas for every figure. He was ſo powerfull in his Art, that King <hi>Attalus</hi> is reported to have bought one of his pictures for an hundred talents; <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 10. <hi>Polycletus</hi> made <hi>Diadumenon</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly youthfull, which was famous for the price of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred talents; <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxiv, 8. When <hi>L. Mummius</hi> ſaw that <hi>Attalus</hi> the King bought out of the prey of Corinth one piece done by <hi>Ariſtides</hi> for ſix thouſand ſeſterces, he could not but wonder at the price; wherefore ſuſpecting that there was ſome unknowne vertue in that picture, he called it backe, not without great complaints of <hi>Attalus,</hi> Plinie xxxv, 4. <hi>Apelles</hi> having painted <hi>Alexander</hi> the great in the temple of <hi>Diana Epheſia,</hi> holding a thunderbolt in his hand, at the price of twentie talents of gold, the reward of his workmanſhip was given him in golden coin by meaſure not by number; <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 10. <hi>Lucullus</hi> agreed with <hi>Arceſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> a worker in clay to make him an image of Felicitie for xliiii ſeſterces: the death of both hindered the worke. And when <hi>Octavius</hi> a Romane knight would make a fine drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-cup, <hi>Arceſilaus</hi> had a talent of him for making a pattern of plaiſter-worke. <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 12. <hi>Mnaſon</hi> the tyrant gave unto <hi>Aſclepiodorus</hi> for the images of twelve Gods three hundred minas a piece: the ſame <hi>Mnaſon</hi> gave alſo unto <hi>Theomneſtus</hi> an hundred minas for the picture of every one of the Worthies painted by him <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 10. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the orator bought <hi>Cydias</hi> his Argonaurs for xliiij ſeſterces,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:11347:96"/>
and made a chappell for this picture in his Tuſculan coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-houſe; <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 11. <hi>Timomachus Byzantius</hi> in the times of <hi>Caeſar dictator</hi> made for him the pictures of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Medea; Caeſar</hi> payed fourſcore talents for them, ſetting them up in the temple of <hi>Venus genetrix.</hi> Plin. xxxv, 11. In the mention of Statues there is one neere the <hi>Roſtra</hi> that may not be forgotten, although the author of it be not knowne; the Statue of <hi>Hercules</hi> cloathed in an Elean habit: he hath a lowring countenance, and ſeemeth to feele his laſt agonie in his coat. That this Statue was judged to be worth a great deale of ſtrife, may be gathered out of the three ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles it ſheweth: the firſt is, that it was <hi>L. Lucullus</hi> the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall his booty taken from the enemies: the ſecond is, that <hi>Lucullus</hi> his ſonne a pupill did dedicate it by the decree of the Senate: the third is, that <hi>T. Septimius Sabinus,</hi> when he was Aedilis curulis, reſtored it to the publike out of a privat poſſeſſion; <hi>Plin.</hi> xxxiv, 8. <hi>M. Agrippa,</hi> though he was a man that might ſeeme to be more given to ruſticitie then to ſuch kinde of delicacies, yet did he buy from the inhabitants of Cyzicus two pictures of <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> for twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeſterces. <hi>Plin.</hi> xxxv, 4. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken very much with <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> his Archigallus, and kept this picture, valued LX ſeſterces, in his bed-chamber. <hi>Plin.</hi> xxxv, 10. It is reported that hundred talents of the tribute enjoyned were abated to the inhabitants of Coos, to make them willing to part with the picture of <hi>Venus anadyomene. Strabo lib.</hi> XIV. <hi>Geogr. Nicomedes</hi> the King would have bought <hi>Praxiteles</hi> his <hi>Venus</hi> of the Gnidians, offering for it to pay all their debts, which did amount to a great ſumme of money: but they choſe rather to endure any extremitie, then to part with ſuch a rare piece of worke: neither was it without cauſe that the Gnidians did ſhew themſelves ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11347:97"/>
ſeeing <hi>Praxiteles</hi> made <hi>Gnidus</hi> renowned by this piece of worke. <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxvi, 5. <hi>Lyſippus</hi> made the ſtatue of one rubbing of himſelfe, which <hi>Marcus Agrippa</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſet up before the entrance into his bathes. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour was ſo much taken with this ſtatue, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the beginning of his raigne he had his affections in his power, he could not long command himſelfe in this, but tooke it away and ſet it up in his bed-chamber, placing another in the roome of it, which the people of Rome took ſo hainouſly, that in the publike theaters with one voice they often and with much importunitie required it might be reſtored; never ceaſing till the Emperour, though much againſt his will, cauſed it to be ſet up in the former plate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxiv, 8. Our age ſaw in the chancell of <hi>June</hi> in the Capitoll a dogge of braſſe licking the hinder parts of ſwine: the ſingular miracle and neere reſemblance unto truth of which ſtatue is not onely underſtood in that it was dedicated there, but by a new kinde of ſuretiſhip taken for it alſo; for it being valued at ſo high a rate, that no ſumme of money was thought ſufficiently anſwerable for the loſſe of it, it was reſolved by publicke advice, that thoſe which undertooke the cuſtodie of it, ſhould binde their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the performance of their undertakings. <hi>Plin.</hi> xxxiv, 7. It is much queſtioned who were the makers of <hi>Olympus, Pan, Chiron,</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> which are ſet up in a place knowne by the name of <hi>Septa;</hi> much the more, becauſe fame hath delivered them worthy to be anſwered with the lives of them that undertook their keeping. <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxvi, 5. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Cleſis</hi> made famous by the injurie done to Queene <hi>Stratonice</hi> is very remarkable: for much diſdaining the ſlender entertainment he received from her, he painted her in the wanton embracements of a fiſher-man the Queene
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:11347:97"/>
was ſayd to be in love withall; and leaving this picture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the publike view in the haven of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he took ſhipping and eſcaped away: the Queene, for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Art and rare expreſſion of the perſons, would not ſuffer the picture to be removed; ſo beſtowing upon the art, though in a ſubject moſt contumelious and ſpightfull, the honor ſhe had denied to the Artificer, <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 11.</p>
               <p>§ 4. It appeareth by all theſe examples what care great Kings and mightie Common-wealths tooke to cheriſh the brave ſpirits of excellent Artificers; and there was good cauſe for it; ſeeing it moſt of all concerneth thoſe that are vertuous, for the upholding of Arts invented, to make ſome difference betweene deſerving and undeſerving men. <hi>Whoſoever performeth deeds worthy of verſes,</hi> ſayth <note n="*" place="margin">In praefat. libri Tertii de laudib.

                  <hi>Claudian, is alſo a lover of verſes:</hi> even ſo muſt they needs love Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, who know themſelves worthy of that honour. The Artificers themſelves did likewiſe reape great profit out of this reſpect the flower of the world gave them; neither was it poſſible they ſhould thinke meanly of themſelves, ſeeing they could not but judge their Arts worth ſo much as they ſaw them valued at by the matchleſſe moderators of earthly things: having therefore once drunke in this perſwaſion, they were inſtantly poſſeſſed with the love of a ſtrange mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie. <hi>Nicias</hi> refuſed to ſell his picture called <hi>Necyia</hi> to King <hi>Attalus,</hi> who offered for it LX talents: but being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very rich, choſe rather to beſtow it as a preſent upon his Country. <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 11. <hi>Zeuxis</hi> firſt began to make preſents of his workes, ſaying that no price could be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their worth; ſo he beſtowed <hi>Alomena</hi> upon the inhabitants of Agrigentum, <hi>Pan</hi> upon <hi>Archelaus; Plinie</hi> xxxv, 9. <hi>Polygnotus</hi> painted at Athens the porch called <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile</hi> freely; whereas <hi>Mycon</hi> did paint a part of it for a reward:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11347:98"/>
no wonder then that <hi>Polygnotus</hi> was of more eſteeme and authoritie: and the <hi>Amphictyones,</hi> a publike councell of <hi>Greece,</hi> beſtowed upon him lodgings rent-free; <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 9. It was then diſcreetly done of theſe Artificers, that they would not leſſen the authoritie of their Art: ſeeing <hi>many things loſe their worth for nothing ſo much,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quintilian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>

By the conſideration of the honour given to theſe Arts, the Artificers themſelves were admoniſhed to uſe them with more reſpect, and being aſhamed to confine Arts of ſo large extent within a narrow compaſſe, they would not employ them in adorning the walls of private houſes for the delight of particular land-lords onely, nor of ſuch places as could not be defended from the danger of caſuall fires. <hi>Protogenes was contented with a little cottage in his garden. In the plaiſterings of</hi> Apelles <hi>his houſe there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any picture to be ſeene: no body as yet tooke a pleaſure in painting whole walls over: all their art was for Cities, and the</hi> Painter <hi>was a publike thing for the benefit of all Countries,</hi> ſayth <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 10. <hi>There is extant a moſt magnificent and worthy oration of</hi> M.

So was it then a cuſtome full of modeſty, and it did ſhew in them a wonderfull veneration of theſe Arts, that they would have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie looke upon all their workes as if they were their laſt workes, and that the fatall houre had taken them away before they could make a full end. It is reported that there have beene but three pictures which were abſolutely inſcribed,</hi> Apelles fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, <hi>Apelles hath made it: whereby it did appeare that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have the Art above all things ſecured: and for this reaſon were all ſuch workes ſubject to a great deale of envie.</hi> That now they ſped well with that tender care they had of the credit of theſe Arts, is manifeſt out of the following words of <hi>Plinie, It is a very rare and moſt memorable thing,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> xxxv, <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note>, <hi>that the laſt workes of Artificers and their unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect pictures have been in greater admiration then the perfect; as namely,</hi> Ariſtides <hi>his</hi> Iris, Nicomachus <hi>his</hi> Tyndarides, Timomachus <hi>his</hi> Medea, Apelles <hi>his</hi> Venus; <hi>ſeeing there are in ſuch kinde of Pictures to be ſeene the remaining lineaments and the very thoughts of the Artificers: ſo doth our griefe alſo commend the worke unto us, whileſt we cannot but love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the hands which periſhed in the midſt of ſuch a worke.</hi> But here muſt we needs note by the way, that when the ancient Artificers are ſayd to have been ſpurred on by the hope of glory, it is meant of the true and ſolid glory, and not of a falſe and momentany ſhadow of the ſame. Many that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank-like onely brag of their Art, miſtake themſelves herein very much; for whileſt they doe by a prepoſterous ambition make haſte to attaine to the much deſired glory and praiſe, they doe thinke themſelves very well if they can but make their pictures faire to the eye of unſkilfull ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

               <p>§ 6. This generous love of an everlaſting renowne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Artificers as long as theſe Arts were had in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme by Kings and Nations: but after that the love of money began to thruſt this veneration of Art out of the hearts of men, Artificers alſo grew thinner and thinner, till none at length were left: this was the obſervation of <hi>Arbiter</hi> a good while ſince: <hi>I did aske,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">In Satyrico.</note>, <hi>a moſt skilfull man concerning the different ages and times of diverſe pictures, as alſo concerning ſome other arguments obſcure unto me, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning withall the cauſes of our preſent ſloathfulnes, by the which ſo many brave Arts are utterly loſt, and how it came to paſſe that the art of painting among ſuch a number of decayed Arts had not retained ſo much as the leaſt ſhadow of her ancient beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. His anſwer was, that the love of money made this change. For in old time, when naked vertue was yet in eſteem, ſayd he, all kinde of ingenuous arts did flouriſh; and the greateſt ſtrife amongst men was, that nothing might be long hid what might be for the profit of poſteritie. To ſpeake then ſomething of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries, povertie hath undone</hi> Lyſippus <hi>whileſt he did hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the lineaments of one ſtatue; and</hi> Myron, <hi>who did in a manner encloſe the ſoules of men and wilde beaſts in braſſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:11347:99"/>
                  <hi>could finde no heire. But we now, lying deepely plunged in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe and lechery, dare not ſo much as try any arts: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon us to be accuſers, rather than followers of antiquity, we teach and learne nothing elſe but vices. Doe not wonder therefore that picture is loſt, ſeeing all the gods and men think a lumpe of gold better than all that</hi> Apelles <hi>and</hi> Phydias <hi>a couple of doting Grecians have made.</hi> See alſo <hi>Theocr. Idyl. xvi. Plin. in prooemio lib. xiv. Dionyſ. Longinus de ſublimi O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. § ultimâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 7. When ſuch great and eminent men therefore as ſhould have been the ſupporters of art, grew ſlacke, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their chiefeſt felicitie to conſiſt in the poſſeſſion of gold and ſilver; thoſe arts alſo which from their greateſt good were called Liberall, became ſervile. For the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers finding but ſmall comfort in the exerciſe of their owne arts, did moſt readily and heartily embrace the moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſolace of luxurious paſtime, ſtudying only how to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the expences of luxury by avarice; and ſo quenching the ſmall remnant of generous thoughts, by theſe two moſt peſtilent and pernitious vices, it could not then be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that both Arts and artificers ſhould miſ-carry and go to wracke. Of luxury ſayth <hi>Seneca</hi> the Rhetorician, <note n="*" place="margin">In prooem. lib. I. contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ.</note> 
                  <hi>There is nothing ſo deadly to the wit of man as luxurie.</hi> Of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, ſayth <hi>Epictetus,</hi>

                  <hi>The deſire of riches maketh men baſe minded.</hi> See <hi>Horace</hi> in his Art of Poëſie. <hi>Gold and ſilver was in old time mixed with braſſe,</hi> ſayth Pliny, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>and yet was the art more coſtly than the materiall. Now on the contrary, it is uncertaine whether the art or the materiall bee worſe: And which is very ſtrange, though the value of rare workes is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely encreaſed, yet is the authoritie of the art quite gone: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all is now done for gaine, what was wont to be done for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Marke here onely by the way, that theſe words of <hi>Pliny</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:11347:100"/>
doe not diſallow of all gaine, neither can there be any juſter kinde of gaine, than out of the honeſt induſtry of a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Art; principally if the ſayd Art take up ſo much of a mans time, that hee cannot thinke of any other way to gain by. <hi>Pliny</hi> his meaning is, That the ancient artificers did firſt and moſt of all aime at glory, knowing that they ſhould have gaine enough, having once obtained the credit of a good workman. Theſe two things may therfore very wel ſtand together, That an artificer ſhould chiefely intend the glory of his name, and yet in the ſecond place looke after ſome reaſonable gaine; ſeeing an honeſt deſire of gain, free from the baſeneſſe of a minde that gapeth for nothing but money, doth greatly encreaſe our endeavors in all maner of Arts. <hi>It is knowne well enough,</hi> ſayth <hi>Caſſiodorus,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Variar.</hi> 7. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>that the ſtudies of Arts are to be nouriſhed and maintained with reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rewards. Theophylactus Simocatus</hi> expreſſeth the ſame more copiouſly: <hi>The hunger and thirſt of gold in mankinde,</hi> ſaith he, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>is very profitable; for thereby our life is furniſhed with good arts, cities are inhabited, and mutuall contracts are performed with a great deale of eaſe. To be briefe, the inhabited world ſhould be deprived of all decencie of order, if for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of gold men ſtood not in need of one the other. A mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would not put to ſea, a traveller would not undertake a journey, husbandmen would not be troubled with the keeping of plow-oxen, the ſoveraignty of Royall ſcepters ſhould want re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the ſubjects could not be honoured with dignities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, it ſhould not be in the power of a General to lead an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And if you will learne a great ſecret, Gold is put in truſt with the reines of vertue and vice; the appetite of our ſoule is tried by it, ſeeing it may very well be compared with the Celtick River, in that it yeeldeth an unfallible proofe of counterfeit vertue.</hi>

Underſtand here by <hi>Succeſſe</hi> nothing elſe, but that ſame veneration Art enjoyed as long as Kings and Nations made much of it. <hi>Afterwards by boldneſſe,</hi> ſaith hee, to inſinuate unto us, that this ſucceſſe made the artificers more prompt and ready to venture upon greater matters. The huge Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſes of the Antients may ſerve here for an example; and <hi>Pliny</hi> in the ſayd place bringeth in ſome of them for a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their moſt confident boldneſſe. <hi>Zeuxis</hi> hath bin above all the reſt admired for this boldneſſe, ſeeing <hi>hee did firſt enter into the gates opened by</hi> Apollodorus, <hi>ſaith</hi> Pliny <note n="*" place="margin">

Dinocrates</hi> hath alſo given us a notable example of confidence, which, God willing, ſhall be related in our Catalogue. It was then very well avouched by <hi>Melanthius</hi> the Painter, in his books written of the Art of painting, that it is not amiſſe there ſhould be perceived ſome kinde of ſelfe-liking &amp; hardneſſe in the works of excellent Artificers. See <hi>Laërt. lib. iv, in Polemone.</hi> There is a <hi>Theſeus</hi> done by <hi>Euphranor,</hi> of whom he ſayd, that <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> his <hi>Theſeus</hi> was fed with roſes, but that his <hi>Theſeus</hi> was fed with fleſh.

11. So did then the Antients boldly follow the motions of their ſtirred ſpirit; where as <hi>we on the contrary, as if now all were perfect dare not bring forth any thing,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§ 2. Much then doth that excellencie of ſpirit availe, that will not ſuffer it ſelfe to be daunted by the authoritie of them that are like to cenſure our worke. For as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vice of a temerarie and arrogant confidence is verie much to be deteſted; ſo is it not poſſible that art, ſtudy, yea advancement it ſelfe, ſhould helpe any thing, without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet and conſtant confidence; even as an unwarlike cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſhall not be much the better, though you furnïſh him with all manner of exquiſit armor. We are therefore above all things to avoid this prepoſterous ſhamefaſtneſſe, which is nothing elſe but <hi>a certaine kinde of feare,</hi> ſayth Quintili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>drawing backe our minde from thoſe things that are to be done; whereupon followeth moſt commonly confuſion, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what we have already begun: ſo that no body doubteth to referre that paſſion among the number of vices, that maketh us aſhamed of doing well. I am almoſt loth to ſay it, becauſe it may be miſtaken, that ſhame faſtneſſe is a vice, but a lovely one, yea ſuch a one as doth moſt eaſily ingender vertues: ſhee doth in the mean time great hurt, cauſing all that is good in our wits and ſtudies, for want of publiſhing, to be conſumed by the ruſt of too much ſecrecie. Howſoeuer, confidence is the beſt way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this ſhamefaſtneſſe: and though a man bee nevr ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, yet may he ſupport himſelfe by the helpe of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if he be but privy unto himſelfe that hee wanteth no art.</hi> Although a forward boldneſſe be all in all, yet may not the Artificer be ſo ſecure as not to underſtand the danger, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that it bee an underſtanding of the worke, and no
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11347:101"/>
feare; he may be moved with it, though hee muſt not yeeld and fall downe under it. For how great danger is there in this worke, wherein wee are very often deceived by a ſhew of goodneſſe? <hi>Whoſoever doth affect ſmooth things,</hi> ſaith Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race <note n="*" place="margin">De Arte Poet.</note>, <hi>wanteth ſinewes and ſpirit for the moſt part. Hee that profeſſeth great things is very often puffed up. He that wil bee too ſecure, and ſtandeth alwayes in feare of a ſtorme, uſeth to creepe along the ſhore. The very ſhunning of vice, when it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth art, leadeth us unto vice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are alſo lead into errour by the great multitude of them that judge amiſſe, ſeeing unskilfull artificers doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in their opinion paint with more force. And it is ever ſeene, that the unlearned do beleeve thoſe things to be of greater force, which want art: even as they uſe to think it a matter of greater ſtrength to breake up, than to open; to teare aſunder, than to unty; to draw, than to leade. They doe moſt frequently judge alſo, that there is more greatnes in rude things, than in ſuch things as are poliſhed: yea, that there is more copiouſneſſe in things wildely ſcattered, than in things well and orderly digeſted. As many then as are beſt experienced in thſe arts, doe moſt of all feare the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the work, the ſeverall events of the Art, the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and uncertaine expectation of men. It is not ſafe to do any thing fooliſhly before the face of the world, when wee begin to try the hope of a durable name: neither is it a ſmall matter to undergoe the cenſure of the whole world: ſo doth an invited gueſt alſo expect a great deale better entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than one that commeth of his own motion ſuddenly upon us. Such as are provoked, judge more nicely: neither will they be ſatisfied with meere allurements, and a kind of pleaſing noveltie, where they do look for the true force of Art. It falleth out very often alſo, that we ſpy the vices
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:11347:102"/>
ſooner in the workes of others, than their vertues: and whatſoever doth juſtly offend the ſpectator, uſeth alſo to extinguiſh the glory of praiſe-worthy things: in theſe arts chiefely, which are not ſo much for neceſſarie uſe, as a free recreation of the minde, how nicely doe men cenſure. <hi>As in a moſt pleaſing banquet, a confuſed harmony, groſſe ointments, and Poppy with honey of Sardus do offend us,</hi> ſayth Horace <note n="*" place="margin">De arte Poeticâ.</note>, <hi>becauſe the feaſt might be very well without them; ſo is it with Poëmes, which being invented to delight and recreate the mind, are eſteemed moſt baſe if they doe but ſwarve a little aſide from that height of grace they ſhould have.</hi> What <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith here of Poëts, may alſo be applied to painters and ſtatuaries, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their induſtry doth intend nothing elſe but the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our eyes, as <hi>Max. Tyrius</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Diſſertat.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>§ 3. An artificer therefore is to take care, that hee doe not onely give them content, who muſt of neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with his worke: but that he may alſo ſeem admirable unto them, which may judge freely of what hee doth. It is not enough an artificer ſhould paint well after his owne liking, but after the liking of accurate and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpectators; neither may hee thinke himſelfe to have painted well, unleſſe skilfull men thinke him to have done ſo. Whatſoever is to be dedicated unto poſteritie, and to remaine for an example unto others, had need be neat, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and made according to the true rule and law of art; becauſe it is likely to come into the hands of skilfull cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and ſuch as are artificers ſhall judge of his art. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore is not able to make workes worthy of the eyes of men, nor to deſerve the name of an Artificer, &amp; yet is not touched with that reverend reſpect due to the art he defileth, though he ſtudy never ſo much to decline infamy, may juſtly be eſteemed impudent: <hi>ſeeing wee are to ſhun the</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:11347:102"/>
                  <hi>name of impudence,</hi> ſayth Tully <note n="*" place="margin">Li. i. de ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore.</note>, <hi>not by ſhewing our ſelves to he aſhamed, but by not doing thoſe things we may bee iuſtly aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of.</hi> We are therefore to uſe here ſo much moderation, <hi>as not to lay over-haſtily aſide all ſhame, and to publiſh our raw and unripe ſtudies,</hi> ſaith Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Li. xii. orat. Inſtit. cap.</hi> 6.</note>; <hi>for by thus doing, there is ingendred in us a contempt of the worke, wee doe lay the grounds of impudence, and (which is every where moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) a foole-hardy confidence preventeth our ſtrength. Neither ought we to delay our firſt triall till wee wax old, for feare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth daily, and what we are to attempt ſeemeth ſtil to grow harder and more difficult, and it groweth too late to beginne, whileſt we loſe time in deliberating when to begin. It behooveth us therefore to bring forth the greene and ſweet-fruit of our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whileſt pardon, hope, and favour readily attend us: neither doth it miſ-become us to attempt ſomething boldly, ſeeing age may ſupply what there is wanting in the work; and if any thing ſeemeth to be painted ſomwhat youthfully, it is eſteemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of a promiſing forwardneſſe of our naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A youth therefore in my opinion, that doth as yet rely upon his tender ſtrength, is to begin with an eaſie and pleaſing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even as dog-whelps are fleſhed with a more gentle prey of wilde beaſts: neither is he from this beginning to continue his labour and to harden his wit, which is rather to be cheriſhed. So ſhall be beſt overcome the feare of beginning, whileſt it is eaſier for him to adventure; and yet ſhall this facilitie of daring not bring him to a contempt of the worke.</hi> Let him for all that, at the firſt follow the ſteps of a wary leader, till he find it ſafe to reſolve with <hi>Lyſippus,</hi> unto a further boldneſſe upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of <hi>Eupompus</hi> his anſwer, as we have related the ſame in the third chapter of this booke, § 3.</p>

The caſe ſtandeth thus: We must doe our best, and yet according to our abilitie, ſeeing it is ſtudy, and not indignation that doth advance us. Wherefore if the winde ferveth, we are to make ſaile, and we are ſometimes alſo to follow our ſtirred paſsions, in which heate doth for the moſt part more than diligence. Provided onely, That this indulgence doe not deceive us: For it is most naturall unto us, to love every thing wee doe, whileſt it is a doing.</hi>

Wherefore beſides that ſame ſlowneſſe urged a little before, and beſides that ſtay our hand giveth us, not being able in the moſt forward exerciſe of deſigning, to overtake the quickneſſe of our minde, we ſhall doe well to breath our ſelves now and then purpoſely, &amp; to review our ſuſpected forwardneſſe, by unbending the intention of our thoughts. For as we ſhall by this meanes bee more able to make a handſome connexion of things, ſo ſhall wee likewiſe avoid that wearineſſe that might hinder our further dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: for the wearineſſe of our minde, though it be not ſo apparant at the firſt, is no leſſe tireſome than the wearineſſe of our body, weakening our mind not for the preſent one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo for the time to come. The firſt heate alſo brought to the work, when it waxeth cooler, receiveth new ſtrength, and is revived by ſuch a delay; even as we ſee, that

to looke on, untill he by handling and poliſhing gave them perfect lineaments. Emendation therefore being the onely way to perfection, it hath bin ſayd upon very good ground that the pencil doth ſometimes help the art, as well by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing out what was painted, as by painting. <hi>There belongeth to this worke,</hi> ſayth Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">

Now it is no doubt, but that the beſt way for emendation is to lay by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne for a time, till it may ſeem unto us a new or another mans invention: leſt our owne, like new births, pleaſe us too much.</hi> Certainly ſo it is, our mindes being caried away by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſtreame of a ready invention, uſe to judge then more readily and warily, when our running thoughts being ſtaid, give us time to conſider what we have to doe. Hence it is that Painters, who after a reaſonable pauſe, returne to their diſcontinued workes as meere ſpectators, doe more advance the art, than others that doe not care what haſte they make to finiſh the worke. <hi>Thoſe painters do very well,</hi> ſaith Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch <note n="*" place="margin">De cohiben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dâ irâ.</note>, <hi>who looke upon their workes before they accompliſh them, after ſome delay; ſeeing they do renew their iudgements, by turning their eyes now and then off from the worke.</hi> It is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requred here, this reſpite be not too long; becauſe it is moſt certaine, that nothing is eaſily reſumed after a great diſcontinuance. <hi>For who doth not know, that all arts and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers receiue the greateſt benefit by uſe,</hi> ſayth <hi>Sidonius</hi>

Though wee have as yet ſomewhat diffuſedly commended a ſlow and wary care unto the diligent Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of art, yet may every one follow a ſhorter way to put himſelfe in minde of this dutie; if <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour his motto <hi>Feſtina lentè</hi> ſound daily in his eares: and as we have alreadie ſpoken of diverſe things whereby the warie care of a leiſurely haſte is quite over-throwne, ſo may wee not forget to mention what hurt the art receiveth by them who not contenting themſelves with an ordinary haſte, have ſtudied to finde out compendious wayes of painting.

               </p>
               <p>§ 2. In thoſe Artificers that were commended for an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall force of Art, there did very often appeare an unequall power of Fortune, as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> prooveth by many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Though Artificers,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">In praefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one libri Tertii.</note>, <hi>make promiſe and vaunt of their skill, if they have not ſtore of money, if they be not known by the ancient renowne of their ſhoppes, if they want popular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and eloquence, the induſtry of their ſtudies cannot gaine them ſo much authoritie as to make them be beleeved to know what they profeſſe to know. Wee finde this moſt of all in ancient Statuaries and Painters; ſeeing the memory of none of them could be durable, but of ſuch as were graced by commendation, and ſhewed ſome outward markes of dignitie. This was the caſe of</hi> Myron, Polycletus, Phydias, Lyſippus, <hi>and of others that gained a noble fame by means of their Art; ſeeing they got this credit by working for Kings, great Cities, and noble Citizens. Others on the contrarie which had no leſſe induſtrie, wit, and ſubtiltie, got no name at all, becauſe they wrought for ignoble and meane Citizens; and it was rather want of Fortune, then want of skill that did ſuppreſſe and obſcure their fame: ſuch were</hi> Hellas Athenienſis, Chiron Corinthius, Myagrus Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeus, Pharax Epheſius, Bedas Byzantius, <hi>and many more. Some Painters alſo wanted Fortune, as</hi> Ariſtomenes Thaſius, Polycles Atramitenus, Nicomachus, <hi>and others, in whom there wanted neither induſtrie, ſtudie, nor cunning; but their</hi>

                  <hi>owne povertie, and their bad fortune, that made them yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their competitors in a partially cenſured concertation, did hinder their dignitie. Plinie</hi> reporteth <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>§ 3. Seeing then that many Artificers were not ſo much unlike one unto another in their Art as in their Fortune, it may ſeeme that there was a certaine kinde of ill-conceived opinion which did keepe downe ſome excellent Artificers, and that others on the contrary got credit and authoritie by reaſon of a loving and favourable opinion. <hi>The vulgar ſort of men,</hi> ſayth <hi>Tullie</hi>

Yet did not the ancients think that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Art conſiſted in a meete obſerving of theſe five points, except the whole worke did breath forth a certaine kinde of Grace procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of a decent comelineſſe of every point by itſelf, and out of a mutuall accord of all five.

But as there is alwayes ſome piece of hiſtorie in the Pictures of this nature, which maketh up the Invention, ſo doth a continued hiſtory affoord our Invention ſufficient matter to work upon: provided onely that our Invention be not dry and barren, but rather aboundant, over-flowing, and more diffuſed then the preſent occaſion ſeemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: to the end our cheerefull minde having attempted ſomething more licentiouſly, might range about, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend rather in too much plenteouſneſſe, than languiſh and pine away for lacke of good matter. For what availeth, I pray you, Invention without matter? where ſhall it begin? whither ſhall it turne it ſelfe? the lively ſpirits of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers diſdaine to be ſo ſtraightened: it is worſe than death unto them to ſpend the ſtrength of their wits about a ſpare and unprofitable argument. I doe not ſtudie to induce any man to ſuch an unadviſed and temerary licentiouſneſſe, as uſeth to ſollicite and to corrupt many brave and lively wits; but I doe hold that free and forward ſpirits are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained within the compaſſe of a narrow cariere, but that wee muſt rather give our Invention the full raines: for as mettled horſes are beſt knowne by a ſpacious race; ſo muſt Artificers have an open field, as it were, to runne in, with a looſe and unreſtrained libertie, ſeeing the forwardneſſe of this ſame moſt generous Art is weakened and broke when a man goeth about to contain it within the limits and bounds of a ſtraight running-place. <hi>You that meane to imitate,</hi> ſayth <hi>Horace</hi>

As for the things an Artificer ſhall judge to be worth his pains, he ſhall not onely invent them after the beſt way, but alſo after the eaſieſt way; ſeeing the higheſt force of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting deſerveth no admiration, if an unluckie penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth trouble and diſquiet the Artificer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end of his worke.

Invention; he needs not beate his braines with irkeſome ſtudies; all ſtandeth readie at his command. Whoſoever climbeth, laboureth moſt of all about the nether part of the hill; in the meane time the ground he goeth on, groweth more rich and fertile: fruits unlaboured doe afterwards of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves, and all things ſpring up of their own accord; the which for all that doe wither away, if they are not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered every day.

All arts and ſtudies muſt concurre to make up that ſame general well grounded knowledge, whereby we are fitted and prepared to produce a good invention: neither is it well poſſible that any man whoſoever hee bee, ſhould invent any thing worth our conſideration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he have drunke in from his childehood all manner of

               </p>
               <p>A perfect and exactly handled invention muſt bud forth out of a great and well rooted fulneſſe of learning: we muſt be converſant in all ſorts of ſtudies, all antiquitie muſt bee familiar unto us, but moſt of all the innumerable multitude of hiſtoricall and poëticall narrations: we muſt likewiſe be very wel acquainted with all ſuch commotions of the mind as by nature are incident unto men: ſeeing the whole force of painting doth principally conſiſt in them, and nothing beareth a greater ſway in ſuch a manifold varietie of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and ſtatues.</p>
               <p>Thus do we ſee how the ancients did after a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner aſcribe wiſedome unto the better ſort of Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſeeing none among all other liberall arts do require ſo many and ſo great helps of more inward and profound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.

               <p>§ 7. That Artificers have need of Geometry and the Opticks is proved by the following example. the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans intending to conſecrate an excellent image of <hi>Minerva</hi> upon a high pillar, ſet <hi>Phidias</hi> and <hi>Alcamenes</hi> to work, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

to chuſe the better of the two. <hi>Alcamenes</hi> being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all skilled in Geometry and in the Optickes, made the goddeſſe wonderfull faire to the eye of them that ſaw her hard by. <hi>Phidias</hi> on the contrary, as being ſufficiently inſtructed with al maner of arts, and eſpecially with Optick and Geometricall knowledges, did conſider that the whole ſhape of his image ſhould change according to the height of the appointed place, and therefore made her lips wide open, her noſe ſomewhat out of order, and all the reſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, by a certaine kinde of reſupination. When theſe two images were afterwards brought to light and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Phidias</hi> was in great danger to have been ſtoned by the whole multitude, untill the ſtatues were at length ſet on high. For <hi>Alcamenes</hi> his ſweet and diligent ſtrokes beeing drowned, and <hi>Phidias</hi> his diſ-figured and diſtorted hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being vaniſhed by the height of the place, made <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> to be laughed at, and <hi>Phidias</hi> to bee much more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

                  <hi>Amulius</hi> his <hi>Minerva</hi> ſeemeth alſo to have been made by the help of theſe Arts, and chiefly of the Optickes, for from what ſide ſoever a man looketh upon her, ſhe doth likewiſe looke upon him. <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 10. There was in the Syrian goddeſſe her temple an image of <hi>Juno,</hi> which looketh upon you, if you ſtand <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

That ſame <hi>Hercules,</hi> who in the temple of <hi>Antonia</hi> turneth his backe towards us, is thought to be of <hi>Apelles</hi> his hand: the picture (which is very difficult) doth rather ſhew his face, then promiſe it. <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxv, 10.</p>
               <p>§ 8. Artificers are likewiſe taught by the example of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> not to contemne the knowledge of ſuch things as may ſeeme to be but of ſmall account in Nature: for when he had made in the porch at <hi>Athens</hi> called <hi>Poecile</hi> a moſt rare and excellent picture of a horſe, yet was the whole worke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced and laught at, becauſe he had made the lower eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids hairie, contrary to the nature of that creature: ſee <hi>Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. lib.</hi> IV <hi>de Animalib. cap.</hi> 50. <hi>Pollux Onomaſt. lib.</hi> II. <hi>Tzetzes Chiliad.</hi> XII, <hi>hiſt.</hi> 427. And as we perceive here that all ſuch kinde of ignorance turneth to the diſcredit of the Artificer, ſo may we learne out of <hi>Philoſtratus</hi>

Yet ſhall he for all this, as his leiſure ſerveth him, take in hand the writings of morall and naturall Philoſophers, of Poëts, of Hiſtorians, of Mathematicians: for although morall and naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, Poëſie, Hiſtorie, Geometrie, cannot make him a Painter, yet will theſe Sciences make him a more abſolute Painter. Counterpoiſon and other remedies appointed for the cure of wounds and diſeaſes, are compounded of many and very often contrary effects, and there is made out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall things but one mixture, the which though it be not

like unto any of the ingredients, yet is there in it ſome peculiar force drawne out of every one of them. Bees likewiſe doe ſucke out of the juyce of ſeverall flowers ſuch a ſweet and pleaſing ſavour of honey, that all the wit of man is not able to imitate any ſuch thing: and why doe wee then wonder that Picture ſhould lacke the helpe of many Arts; which not being ſenſibly perceived in the worke, are for all that ſecretly felt, by tranſ-fuſing into the Picture a hidden force derived out of many Sciences? It may be objected here that many Painters have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a tolerable ſkill of Art, though they never medled with any of theſe Studies: it is moſt likely to be ſo; and it matters very little if wee doe grant it: ſeeing our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is not about ordinary workmen, but wee doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake of ſuch men as are Painters indeed, that is, men of excellent wittes and great learning, to the perfiting of whom Nature and Studie ſeeme to have moſt lovingly conſpired.</p>

§ 15.

being very ſober in his gate, modeſt in his apparel, having a kinde of ſound in his voyce that he never loſt or altred, and was of very honeſt behaviour, never troubled in his talke for any thing that croſſed him; and many other ſuch like things, as all that ſaw and conſidered them in him, could but wonder at him. See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Pericles</hi> his life. Seeing then that naturall philoſophy could effect ſo much in a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Prince, how ſhall not hiſtory and Poëſie do the ſame in an Artificer?

Yet is this alwayes certaine, that a generous minde hateth vanitie, and that never any man was able to conceive or to bring forth any worthy thing, but ſuch as had great varietie of learning. The others on the contrary, for all their boaſting, never knew the true way to art, or at leaſt had not the courage to tread the known way. There is another ſort of men between the learned and unlearned, who being reaſonably wel acquainted with all the grounds
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:11347:131"/>
of common learning, make for all that a ſhew as if they did not care for it, hoping by this means to procure unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a greater opinion of induſtrie and wit, if they ſhould be thought to doe ſomething without the helpe of other Arts and Sciences; but it is an eaſie matter to finde them out; true learning diſdaineth to be hid; neither can they diſſemble ſo cunningly, but that here and there in their workes diverſe glorious markes of reverend antiquitie will peepe out. To let them therefore alone, wee doe rather wonder at their impudence who preſume to meddle with theſe grave and ſerious Arts, before they have taſted natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and morall Philoſophie, Hiſtorie, Poëſie; not to ſpeak of the Mathematickes; for our moderne wits are ſo deeply plunged and drowned in their ſecure confidence, that they meane to doe well enough without the Mathematickes; yea the beſt of them are content with a ſuperficiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſuch uſefull Arts, not conſidering that a ſleight and careleſſe manner of ſtudying helpeth very little. What we would have take deepe root in our heart and become our owne, requireth aſſiduitie of ſtudie: there is alſo very great difference whether wee bring forth things of our owne, or make uſe of things borrowed; for as the things of our owne come forth with great eaſe, ſo doth the knowledge of many Arts and Sciences wonderfully adorne our works, though we did never intend any ſuch thing; neither doe the more learned onely perceive it, but the ruder ſort doth alſo very often feele it, when they doe commend the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite labours of great Maſters upon the firſt ſight, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to confeſſe that they are filled with all kindes of rare and profound learning. For as much then as a true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer muſt be thoroughly ſkilled in many Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wee may ſee what our times are come to: profitable
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:11347:132"/>
learning is deſpiſed: neceſſary Arts are neglected: every one deemeth himſelfe more wittie and judicious then the ancients: hence it is that the ordinary workes of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers lacke nothing ſo much as Magnificence, being ſtuffed with the droſſe of ſillie and triviall Inventions.</p>
               <p>The noble Art which was anciently waited upon by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and moſt worthy Sciences, is cut ſhort, and having loſt her ancient dignitie, is thruſt out of doores without any attendance or any reſpect; yea ſhee is taught penuriouſly, and learned baſely, being forced to ſeek her bread without any ingenuitie, after the manner of other ſordide, mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike, and mercenarie Arts. But why ſhould indignation thus tranſport me? it is better to laugh them out; leaſt they might thinke themſelves to have obtained great matters, who by all their buſie toile and labours fooliſhly miſ-ſpent are come to ſuch a height of felicitie as to make themſelves to be laughed at. I rather congratulate thoſe happie wits, who thus become Maſters without paines or care: yet am I well aſſured that thoſe who bring minds uncapable of great things, or not well prepared by ſtudie, ſhall with their beſt endeavours effect nothing in this Art anſwerable to their faire hopes: but finding their ſoules barren both by nature and ill culture, muſt content themſelves with the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other men, and employ their whole life in copying their workes, ayming at no other ſufficiencie but to be able to draw after them by lines and rulings. In a manner cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the maide when they cannot obtaine the Miſtreſſe, like <hi>Penelopes</hi> unhappie ſuitors. That which <hi>Cicero</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pro Murae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ.</note> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Greeke Muſicians, that thoſe ſhould blow a pipe which could not touch the lute, may fitly character theſe unworthy Painters, if theſe may be worthy of the name of Painters, or if this may be called painting, which
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:11347:132"/>
high title properly belongeth to them, and to them onely, who are able to expreſſe whatſoever theminde of man can conceive, and dare exhibite it to publike judgement. The former without this perfection is of ſmall worth or uſe, like a good ſword ruſted in the ſcabberd: to this all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions chiefly tend; to attaine this, no means but Art; all ſtudie is to be applied to this; all practice muſt aime at this; this is the bond and but of Imitation; in this a man muſt ſpend his whole life; by this one Maſter out-goeth another; for this onely one Piece and way of painting is more excellent than another. But the neere coherence of this with the following diſcourſe doth lead me too farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the matter of Deſigne or Proportion, which is the ſubject of the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>§ 2. Truely it is likely that Artificers have borrowed the words Analogie and Harmonie from that Proportion which is found in Arithmeticall numbers or in Muſicall concords: for Proportion is nothing elſe but a certain law or rule of numbers which Artificers follow. <hi>Artificers, whoſe trade is to faſhion and to produce bodily figures,</hi> ſayth S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>

Wee ſee therefore, that not onely Muſicians from Painters, but alſo contrariwiſe Painters from Muſicians have borrowed termes of Art; and that for no other cauſe, but onely to ſhew that in both thoſe Arts the ſame reſpect of that manifold Proportion, which conſiſteth in numbers, is had; as if one of them did ſtand in need of the other.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Wherefore ſeeing it is agreed upon of all that even every light conſideration of numbers requireth a quicke and readie uſe of reaſon (for nothing ſooner bewrayeth a weake and crazed underſtanding, then to labour, and hacke, and miſtake in continuing and comparing numbers together) it is evident that this Analogie, wee ſpeake of, needeth a judgement much more exact and ſharpe; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this ſcope, to worke out in one or other materiall the ideall perfection of the numbers conceived in our minde, and as neere as may be to expreſſe the wayes of artificiall and ingenious Nature. <hi>By Symmetrie Art draweth neere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Reaſon,</hi> ſayth <hi>Philoſtratus in prooem.

Indeed God the maker and framer of the Univerſe hath in all his creatures imprinted plaine and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent footſteps of this moſt beautifull Harmonie, which all Artificers endeavour to follow; neither hath any Artificer without the carefull obſerving of this Symmetrie attained to any ſhew or ſhadow of that beauty, which by a due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and agreement of all the parts among themſelves draweth and delighteth the eyes: and this is <hi>that concinni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the bodie and due connexion of all the parts</hi>

The matchleſſe collection of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes made by my Lord of <hi>Arundell</hi> ſerveth here for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe: ſeeing our Honourable Lord out of his noble and art-cheriſhing minde, doth at this preſent expoſe theſe jewells of art to the publike view in the Academie at <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> houſe. <hi>Our ſight,</hi> ſayth <hi>Plutarch</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Pericle.</note>, <hi>is very much revived and fed with the moſt pleaſant and flouriſhing colours.</hi> And as it doth appeare by our former proofe that Lineall picture being done after the true rules of Proportion, may very well repreſent a lively reſemblance of the thing delineated; yet can that ſame ſimilitude not be compared with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a coloured picture. Thus after the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Deſigne and Proportion, it followeth that we ſhould proceed to Colour.</p>

               </p>
               <p>§ 7. Obſcuritie or darkeneſſe ſeemeth to be nothing elſe but the duſkiſhnes of a deeper ſhadow; even as Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may bee ſayd to bee nothing elſe but an intention of light. <hi>For if you do put white and blacke upon the ſame ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall breadth,</hi> ſayth Jo.

II. cap.</hi> 6. ſo that in the picture of gold, the gold it ſelfe was not made by gilding over that part of the picture wherein ſome gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things were to bee repreſented, but by the moſt exact art of imitating gold it ſelfe in lively colours. Brightneſſe then, as it is neceſſarily required in the picture of ſuch like things, ſo is there in every kinde of picture ſome brightnes intermingled for ornament. And though a picture be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much filled with all maner of choice and flouriſhing colours, yet can it hardly pleaſe the eye, unleſſe there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in it ſome bright ſpots tempting and rowſing our ſight with their ſudden, quicke, and flickering light. <hi>Theſe ſhinings ſhew themſelves ceaſing ſwiftly even as a flaſh of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> ſayth Philoſtratus, lib.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. lib. xii. cap. 10. <hi>You may perceive an unequality where</hi>

                  <hi>thoſe things that ſticke out are notable. The height of one Tree is never wondred at, where the whole wood is growne up to the ſame height,</hi> ſayth Seneca, Epiſt. xxxiii. <hi>Theſe lights therefore muſt not be like unto a flame,</hi> as Quintil. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. Inſt. li. viii, cap.</hi> 5.</note> ſpeaketh, <hi>but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſparks ſhining forth out of the ſmoke. Neither do they appear where the whole picture ſhineth, even as ſtars cannot be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a Sun-ſhine. Such lights likewiſe as ſhew themſelves of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and faintly, can never pleaſe the eye, as being only unequall and harſh, not attaining to that admiration heightned things do deſerve, and loſing the grace plaine things are commended for.</hi> Seeing then that not onely the changeable varietie of theſe ornaments, but their raritie alſo is a good and readie means to avoid that loathſome ſacietie an uniforme picture cloyeth us withall, it behooveth an artificer here to admit the wholſome counſell of <hi>Dionyſius Mileſius: We ought to taſt of hony,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">Apud Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſtr. lib.

               <p>§ 9. We learne then diſtinctly out of the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, That <hi>nothing can be bright,</hi> as Seneca ſpeaketh <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 31.</note>, <hi>without the mixture of light.</hi> And that a good while after the invention of Light and Shadow, <hi>there was added unto Picture a certaine kinde of brightneſſe,</hi> ſayth Pliny <note n="*" place="margin">

And here will it not bee amiſſe to obſerve an example or two of this ſame <hi>Harmoge</hi> as it is in nature. For when we behold how the ſea and sky doe meet in one thinne and miſty Horizontal ſtroke, both are moſt ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt and confounded in our eyes, neither are wee able to diſcerne where the one or other doth begin or end: water and aire, ſeverall and ſundry coloured elements, ſeeme to be all one at their meeting.

Neither was it ever ſeene, that any artiſt got by ſuch workes a durable admiration in the hearts of men, but an uncertaine approbation onely, accompanied with idle acclamations, and with a flying joy; ſeeing all that praiſe, as being blaſted in the hearbe or in the floure, not attaine to any ripe or fruitfull maturitie; chiefely if thoſe admirers chance in the meane time to meet with any other more perfect and truly abſolute piece of worke, which maketh their former admiration preſently vaniſh and come to nothing, by an admiration of better things. <hi>Thoſe who are taken with an outward ſhew of things,</hi> ſaith Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">

All commeth in the end to this, that though the colours may juſtly require care, the things themſelves for all that demand ſollicitude. Nevertheleſſe we muſt not alwayes thinke that beſt which is moſt hidden; for the beſt things are ever at hand, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the things themſelves, and moſt eaſily diſcerned by their owne light, being the firſt things our eyes meet with if we winke not: but we ſtill ſeeke them, as if they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually

hide and withdraw themſelves from our eyes; wee never thinke them to bee neere and about the matters in hand: but we ſeeke them in bright colours, and ſome ſuch like ſuperficiall ornaments, weakening the whole ſtrength of our invention and deſigne, with the unſeaſonable care of garniſhing the worke too much.</p>
               <p>Certainly, we are to fal to theſe arts with a more reſolute courage: for whoſoever can but aſſure himſelfe that he hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the maine and weightieſt points of art aright, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an entire body, the ſame needs not trouble himſelfe much about the neatneſſe of ſome little haires, and of the uttermoſt ends of the nailes. <hi>A mean Artificer neer the</hi> Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian <hi>Schoole,</hi> ſayth Horace <note n="*" place="margin">De Arte.</note>, <hi>doth imitate the nails and the ſoft haire moſt accuratly in braſſe: he maketh this the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate height of his workmanſhip, becauſe he doth not know how to expreſſe the whole man as it is fit. As for mine owne ſelfe, if I were to make any thing, I would as little deſire to be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as to have an ill noſe, being otherwiſe graced with black eyes and blacke haire.</hi> The old Commentator maketh this gloſſe upon theſe words of the Poët: <hi>the</hi> Aemilian <hi>ſchool was a place not far from the</hi> Circus, <hi>ſo called becauſe one</hi> Aemilius <hi>had his gladiators there. About this ſame ſchoole there did live a Statuarie who did expreſſe the nailes and haire paſſing well, leaving all the reſt imperfect; wherefore hee was very much laughed at.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I perceive that the earneſt care of admoniſhing draweth me too farre: although my purpoſe was not to ſtrip picture of all manner of ornament, and quite to baniſh it, but to forewarne ſome unadviſed Artiſts onely, that they ſhould not bewray their care of trimming too much, remembring alwayes the praiſe-worthy ſeveritie of <hi>Athenion</hi> the Maro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, who was compared with <hi>Nicias, yea and ſomewhat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi>

it grew an ordinary practice to alter the ſhapes, countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, poſtures, and to fit the whole worke to a certain kinde of action. <hi>There is but ſmall grace in an upright bodie,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quintilian</hi>

It behooveth us onely to caſte our eyes upon Nature, and to inſiſt in her ſteps; ſeeing the whole ſtudie of theſe Arts is principally bent to imitate the ſeverall actions of our minde with a decent and comely grace; neither will the minds of judicious ſpectators admit any thing, unleſſe they doe finde by an accurate col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that there is an indiſcernible ſimilitude between the repreſented figures and the truth of Nature.</p>
               <p>§ 2. All manner of decencie ariſeth out of a comely ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture appearing in the motion of our bodies; and as the head in our bodies themſelves is accounted to be the principall member, ſo is it likewiſe the maine inſtrument whereby we
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:11347:151"/>
doe expreſſe ſuch affections and paſſions of our minde as are moſt decent and ſutable for the preſent occaſions. The head being caſt downe, ſignifieth humbleneſſe; being caſt back, arrogance; being hung on either ſide, languiſhing; being ſtiffe and ſturdie, it ſignifieth a churliſh barbarouſneſſe of the minde. Wee have alſo certaine wayes of graunting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing, and avouching with our head: beſides that therein are ſeated the paſſions of baſhfulneſſe, doubtfulneſſe, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and indignation, incident unto all ſorts of men. The countenance therefore beareth here the greateſt ſway; ſince we doe ſue, threaten, and fawne by the geſture of our countenance: wee are knowne by our countenance to be ſad, merrie, full of courage, or elſe dejected and abaſed: our countenance draweth the eyes of men to it ſelfe, before we doe either ſtirre or ſpeake: it is eaſie to reade love or hatred in our countenances; ſeeing wee are better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them, then by all the words in the world: nay, the motions of the countenance doe beſt expreſſe the ſtate of the mind; as when wee ſee the bloud ſometimes over-flow a tender countenance, diſcovering the ſoules modeſtie by a bluſh; ſometimes againe betraying her cold feares, by an over-pale ebbe; witneſſing likewiſe the mindes calme, by an equall temper of the countenance. Now of all parts of the countenance the eyes are moſt powerfull, being as the ſoules window; for in them, even when they moove not, either our cheerefulneſſe ſhineth forth, or a cloud of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe overſhadoweth them. Nature alſo for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath furniſhed them with teares, which either in griefe burſt forth, or melt with joy. But their motion doth more eſpecially expreſſe our earneſt intention, our neglect, pride, ſpitefulneſſe, meekeneſſe, ſharpneſſe; all which are to be imitated as the nature of the repreſented action ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:11347:151"/>
ſometimes alſo they muſt be ſtaring and piercing, cloſed and hidden, languiſhing and dull, wanton and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or looſly ſwimming in pleaſure, glancing and (to ſpeake ſo, venereall, aſking or promiſing ſomething; which to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, the eye-lids and ball of the cheeke doe wonderfully aſſiſt. The eye-browes have alſo many actions; for they doe in ſome ſort faſhion the eyes, and principally command the fore-head, ſometimes contracting, ſometimes raiſing, and ſometimes letting it fall: wrinkled browes, declare ſadneſſe: freely diſplayed, ſhew cheerefulneſſe: ſhame appeareth in a hanging brow: we doe likewiſe conſent or diſſent by the elation or depreſſion of our browes. The noſe and lips ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie mocking, ſcorning, loathing: even in common ſpeech we muſt take care that the motion of our lips be moderate; ſeeing our diſcourſe is rather a worke of the whole mouth, then of the lips alone, and therefore it is unſeemely to put out the lips, to ſtretch them in length, to preſſe them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to diſcover the teeth by opening them too wide, to draw them awry to either eare, to turne them out for ſcorn. The necke ought to be carried ſtraight, but not ſtiffe, or caſt backe: ſo is it alike ill-becoming, either to contract or to ſtretch out the necke. The ſhrinking up of the ſhoulders is ſeldome decent, for by that the neck is ſhortened, beſides that it is a geſture belonging to a baſe, ſervile, and craftie knave, when with the ſhoulders he doth faine flattery, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, or feare. In familiar ſpeech it is very gracefull gently to caſt forth the arme, ſlacking the ſhoulders a little, and ſpreading the fingers of the hand put forth: but when wee doe repreſent one ſpeaking of a more notable and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious matter, wee ſpread his arme forth toward one ſide, that the diſcourſe might ſeeme to flow according to that motion. As for the hands, without which all action is mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:11347:152"/>
and impotent, it is hard to ſet downe how many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have: for whereas other parts doe aſſiſt us while we ſpeake, the hands themſelves, if a man may ſay ſo, doe ſpeake. For, I pray, doe not the hands demand, promiſe, call, diſmiſſe, threaten, requeſt, abhorre, feare, aſke, deny? doe not the hands expreſſe joy, ſadneſſe, doubt, confeſſion, repentance, meaſure, plentie, number, time? doe not the ſame hands encourage, beſeech, hinder, approve, admire, and witneſſe ſhame? ſo that in this great diverſitie of tongues among all Nations, this ſeemeth to be the common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of all men. The hand hath alſo ſome ſhort motions; for ſometimes it is moved and gently let fall by turnes, with ſome helpe of the ſhoulders, as their manner is that make vowes; which motion is moſt proper for them who ſpeake ſparingly and as it were fearefully. In admiration we hold the hand up, bent ſomwhat backeward, with all the fingers cloſed, which in the returne we do both ſpread and turn in one motion. When we doe aske, we do alwayes frame our geſture after one and the ſame manner, but for the moſt part we change our hand, in what poſture ſoever it is. When we approove or relate, we joyne the top of the fore-finger to the thumbe nail next to it, leaving out the other fingers. A ſlow motion of the hand doth promiſe and ſoothe: a more quicke motion doth exhort ſometimes commending. The hand hollow and ſpread, and lifted up above the ſhoulder with ſome kinde of motion, doth alſo encourage. We cloſe the fingers ends, and gently put them at our mouth, when we wonder and deprecate, fearing ſome ſudden indignitie. In penitence and anger we lay our cloſed hand to the breſt. Such as are skilful and curious in theſe matters, give caution not to lift the hand above the eyes, or not to let it fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the breſt: accounting it a great fault to fetch it from
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:11347:152"/>
the head, or bring it downe ſo low as the belly. Toward the left ſide it moveth as far as the left ſhoulder, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond; onely in averſation, thruſting out the hand toward the left ſide, we bring the left ſhoulder forward, that it may agree with the head bearing toward the right hand. The left hand never maketh any motion alone, but often apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe to the right hand: whether wee ſet our reaſons in order upon our fingers, or deteſt, by turning both palms toward the left ſide; or reſiſt, or ſpread them out on either ſide, endeavoring to give ſatisfaction, or elſe making an humble requeſt. The hands expreſſe alſo ſome further affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſo that their motions in ſmall, ſorrowfull, temperate things be ſhort; but more extended in all manner of great, joyfull, and cruell or tragicall things. The motion of the whole body is alſo of ſome moment, wherein the chiefeſt obſervation ought to be, that the breaſt and belly be not ſo put forth as to bow the backe, ſeeing all ſupinitie is odious. Let the ſides accord with the other motions. In the feet obſerve either their poſture or their motion. It were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to purſue all the particulars. Theſe things alleadged out of <hi>Quintilian</hi>

For it is not enough that carved and painted images reſemble the proportion and colour of the life, unleſſe there doe likewiſe diſcover it ſelfe in the demeanour of the whole body, but eſpecially in the caſt of the eyes, ſome kinde of vigour anſwerable unto the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occaſions and circumſtances of the repreſented hiſtory.

Behind, the haire in a more free length, even downe to the ſhoulders, did hide his faire necke; yet ſo, that in many places it did ſhine betweene the locks. His necke full, his cheeke plumpe and ſmoothe, his face of a meane proportion. His poſture was in all things like a Muſician; he looked upon the goddeſſe as if he ſang, having on an embroidered coat which hung downe to his very feet, with a Grecian girdle. Both his armes were covered with a cloake to the wriſts. All other accoutrements were gracefully ſuited to the perſon. He had his inſtrument cloſe fitted to an emboſſed belt. His pliant hands attended their ſeverall charge: the left being ſomewhat advanced, did with divided fingers warble the ſtrings: the right did in a playing geſture apply the ſticke to the inſtrument, as ready to ſtrike; and at every reſt in the hymne, the ſong ſeemed moſt ſweetly to melt from his round mouth, his lips halfe opening with the endeavor.</hi> The pictures of Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on playing upon the harpe, and of Olympus piping, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Philoſtratus, Iconum lib.

As for my ſelfe, I cannot finde in my heart to tranſcribe all ſuch expreſſions, for feare of being too tedious. I wil only for further proofe of their accurateneſſe in this point, adde a few examples more.</p>

                  <hi>Antiphilus</hi> is commended for a boy blowing the fire, and a faire houſe beginning to glitter, but eſpecially for the lads mouth.

                  <hi>Euphranor</hi> made Alexander Paris: and it is wonderfull in this picture, That Paris may be underſtood at once, to be a Judge of the goddeſſes, a wooer of Helena, and yet a killer of Achilles. Plin. xxxiv. 8.</p>
               <p>§ 4. This was a great point, and mightily ſtudied of the Antients; ſeeing the whole labour of art, wanting this life of manners, is but a dry, barren, and unpleaſant toile, without either ſoule or ſpirit. Neither is there any thing which can adde a more lively and forcible grace to the worke, than the likeneſſe of an outward motion, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the inward commotions of the minde. Socrates therefore doth urge this very much, in his moſt excellent diſcourſe held with <hi>Parrhaſius</hi> the Painter, and with <hi>Clito</hi> the Statuarie. See Xenophon, lib. III Apomnem. When I ſay that this point was much ſtudied of the Antients, my meaning is not that an Artificer ſhould keepe himſelfe too buſie about theſe affections and paſſions of the minde. <hi>The heate of our ſtirred thoughts,</hi> ſayth Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. X, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. inſtit. cap.</hi> 3.</note>, <hi>doeth moſt commonly do more in theſe things than diligence.</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever preſumeth to beat out the true images of all manner of affections and paſſions, by an immoderate eagerneſſe of thinking, the ſame ſhall queſtionleſſe finde himſelfe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Study and diligence will never furniſh us with ſuch images as muſt readily flow out of the nature and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter in hand. An Artificer therfore who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to moove the ſpectator with his worke after it is fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, had need firſt to be mooved himſelfe when hee goeth about to conceive and to expreſſe his intended worke. A minde rightly affected and paſſionated is the onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whereout there doe iſſue forth ſuch violent ſtreames of paſſions, that the ſpectator, not being able to reſiſt, is carried away againſt his will, whitherſoever the force of
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:11347:155"/>
ſuch an Imperious Art liſteth to drive him. See Hor. <hi>in art. poët Afflicted folks, their griefe beeing as yet freſh,</hi> ſayth Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian <note n="*" place="margin">

So doth anger ſometimes make unlearned men well ſpoken; and that for no other reaſon, but becauſe the force of their thorowly ſtirred minde worketh in them the truth of ſuch paſſions. If therefore we do deſire to come neer the truth, it is requiſite that we ſhould finde our ſelves even ſo affected as they are who ſuffer indeed. Nothing can be inflamed without fire; nothing can wet us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moiſture; neither is there ought which giveth unto another thing the colour it hath not. Whatſoever therefore wee would have prevaile with others, muſt firſt prevaile with us: and wee ſhall endeavor in vain to moove others, unleſſe wee do finde our ſelves firſt moved. But how ſhal this come to paſſe that we ſhould be mooved, ſeeing theſe commotions are not in our power? Phantaſie doth ſo repreſent unto our mind the images of things abſent, as if we had them at hand, and ſaw them before our eyes. Whoſoever therefore conceiveth theſe images aright, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto himſelfe the truth of things and actions, the ſame is likely to be moſt powerfull in all manner of affections: ſeeing his endeavors ſhall bee waited upon by a vertue knowne by the Greeke name</hi> Energia. Tully <hi>calleth it</hi> Evidence <hi>and</hi> Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitie. <hi>This vertue ſeemeth to ſhew the whole matter; and it bringeth to paſſe, that the affections follow us with ſuch a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentation, as if we were by at the doing of the things ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</hi>

Let all the joynts and members of a braſen figure be readie caſte, yet ſhall they never make up a ſtatue, not being fitted to their peculiar places; and if then any one part chance to be miſplaced, if an eare ſtandeth in place of the noſe, if a leg be put where the arme ſhould be, the whole figure will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſeem monſtruous and prodigious: all the parts of our bodie, being but lightly put out of joynt, doe inſtantly loſe the uſe they had before: ſo do diſordered Armies moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly feele the want of order. Nature it ſelfe ſeemeth to be upholden by order: and as it is certain that nothing, which wanteth this ſupport, can ſubſiſt; ſo muſt Picture needs run at random, roving and wandering without any guide, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſhion of thoſe who ſtraying in unknowne and dark places cannot tell where to beginne and where to end their journey, ſuffering themſelves rather to be guided by chance then counſell: whoſoever on the contrary hath but once framed in his minde a diſpoſition of the conceived matter, the ſame, if he be but a tolerable Artificer, ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the reſt with a wonderfull eaſe: <hi>The matter being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of aforehand,</hi> ſayth <hi>Horace</hi>

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:11347:159"/>
to conſider what helps there are affoorded us to the furthering of this point But here we are firſt to diſtinguiſh the Diſpoſition as it is annexed to the Invention, from the Diſpoſition as it is the worke of an accurate Proportion. Diſpoſition as it is an exed to the Invention, doth expreſſe a lively image of that order which the nature of the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things imprinteth in our mind: this is a worke of great conſequence, and it requireth ſingular care: for if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had knowne a certaine way of Diſpoſition which might have fitted all matters, a good many ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled in it: <hi>Apelles</hi> eſpecially, that ſame bright lode-ſtarre of Art, ſhould have attained this praiſe above all the reſt: who now, not daring to aſcribe this glory unto himſelfe, was compelled to yeeld unto <hi>Amphion:</hi> ſee <hi>Plinie lib.</hi> xxxv, <hi>cap.</hi> 10.

argument, becauſe hee findeth it more agreeable with his vaſt and unſtayed underſtanding, to entertaine the freenes of his phanſie, and to exerciſe the excellencie of his Art in every part of the conceived matter. Hee ſhrinketh at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but loveth to goe boldly and confidently over the whole hiſtory. He cannot abide to have his phanſie pinned up within the narrow compaſſe of a poor and needy inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; aſſuring himſelfe, that in ſuch an abundance of things his wit and ſkill ſhall ſhew themſelves more aboundantly. So doth <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Icon. li. II. in Rhodog.</note> teach us, That this variety of ſchemes and actions addeth unto the picture a moſt pleaſant grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Thoſe painters likewiſe were ever held in greateſt admiration, which adventured to adde the grace of a judicious and orderly diſpoſition, to the moſt gracefull and commendable varietie of matter. Whereas others, though never ſo excellent in ſmall pieces, are always to ſeek when one or other occaſion putteth them upon a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious argument. They are not able to ſave their former credit, when they doe meet with any more grave &amp; ſerious matter. <hi>Being like unto ſome ſmall creatures,</hi> ſayth Quintili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note n="*" place="margin">

For he was of opinion, that the argument it ſelfe is as well a part of</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§ 9. It is then certaine, that an extraordinary force of Art ſheweth it ſelfe moſt in an extraordinary argument, ſo loveth the beſt ſkill alwayes to buſie it ſelfe about the beſt matter. But ſeeing the Artificers intend nothing ſo much with the whole labour of their art, as to leave unto the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ages an opinion of wit and art; it is likewiſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the worke requireth a round, and not interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted continuance: all the parts of it muſt be connected, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rolling on, and gently flowing or rather following one another, after the manner of them that goe hand in hand to ſtrengthen their pace; they hold and are held. For a Workeman ſhall never be eſteemed judicious and witty, ſo long as there appeare in his work ſome broken and abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſmembred paſſages. Even as they are deſervedly laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, who going about to tell a tale doe nothing but ſtutte and ſtammer, belching out ſome abrupt &amp; pittifully chopt ſpeeches. <hi>Where naked joynts are propounded,</hi> ſayth Seneca <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trov. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oemio.</note>, <hi>it is inſtantly manifeſt, if either the number or the order have not their due.</hi> What in other works uſeth to be rude, looſe, and ſcattered, is ever in a good and perfect worke, well grounded, finely framed, and ſtrongly truſſed up together. The whole period and compaſſe of the repreſented hiſtory is ſo delightſome for the equable roundneſſe of compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo grave for the ſeemely ſimplicity of handling and framing the matter, that it may bee perceived even of the leaſt, liked of the moſt, underſtood and judged only of the Learned. Which default, when as ſome endeavor to ſalve and recure in their workes; they patch up the holes with pieces and ragges borrowed of other mens inventions, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the whole frame of their worke, and making it like unto an ill reliſhed gallamaufrey or hodge-podge, of ſeveral
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:11347:163"/>
and very much diſagreeing things.</p>
               <p>Yet can theſe men finde in their hearts to boaſt, as if ſome inſtinct of an elevated ſpirit had newly raviſhed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the meanneſſe of common capacities. But ſometimes, being in the middeſt of their bravery, ſuddenly either for want of matter, or skill in ordering the matter, ſometimes alſo for having loſt their former conceit looſely hanging together, they are very much pained and travelled in their remembrance, not knowing which way to turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To let theſe ragged and raking painters alone, I wil content my ſelfe to ſay thus much onely, That a picture is ſo much the worſe, how much the better the ſence and art of the ſcattered parts might bee if they were well ordered; ſeeing the neglects committed in the diſpoſition, are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the lightſomeneſſe of the things themſelves; and whatſoever doth not hang well together, bewrayeth it ſelfe as well by an inequalitie of colour, as by the clefts and gaps appearing in a miſ-joyned worke. <hi>Quintil. xii.</hi> 9.</p>

If therefore any one loveth to follow the example of that ſame Pamphilus, <hi>who,</hi> as Tully <note n="*" place="margin">Lib.

                     <hi>Orat. inſtit. lib.</hi> IV, <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note>, <hi>yet doth not the whole accord with the parts.</hi> A pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture therefore may very well bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the excellencie of invention, Proportion, Colour, Life, Diſpoſition, and yet want that comely gracefulneſſe, which is the life and ſoule of Art. Theſe five heads, handled immediately before, do not ſuffer themſelves to be ſevered; one alone will not ſerve; no more will two, or three, or four of them; they muſt go all joyntly hand in hand: if there bee but one wanting, it is to ſmall purpoſe that wee ſhould buſie our ſelves over-much about the reſt. The conſummation of a picture conſiſteth chiefely therin, that theſe five heads con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, and lovingly conſpiring, ſhould breath forth a certain kinde of grace, moſt commonly called <hi>the aire of the picture:</hi> which in it ſelfe is nothing elſe but a ſweet conſent of all manner of perfections heaped up in one piece: the beſt collection of the beſt things.</p>
               <l>Like divers flours, whoſe divers beauties ſerve</l>
               <l>To deck the earth with his well-coloured weed,</l>
               <l>Though each of them his privat form preſerve,</l>

                  </note>. Seeing then that a witty invention doth gently allure our minde, a neat proportion doth readily draw our eyes, a convenient colour doth pleaſingly beguile our phanſie, a lively motion doth forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:11347:166"/>
ſtirre our ſoul, an orderly diſpoſition doth wonderfully charme all our ſenſes; how ſhall not that picture have great power over our mind and ſpirits, in the which all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are moſt ſweetly united into one? The body of a man is not inſtantly eſteemed gracefull and comely, when as every part of it ſeemeth to bee of a goodly feature; but when the perfection of every part produceth a perfectly well favoured comelineſſe in his whole ſhape and poſture. A body therefore may very well be faire, and yet want this gracefull comelineſſe, which raviſheth the eye of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, by beautifying beauty it ſelfe. So doth <hi>Ovid</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. II, de Arte.</note> ſay, That there was in the beauty of <hi>Venus</hi> a ſufficient mixture of grace. And <hi>Suetonius</hi>

                     <hi>In Nerone, cap.</hi> 51.</note> reporteth of <hi>Nero,</hi> That his body was rather faire than comely. Beauty doth not alwayes beget liking; it is onely Grace which maketh faire ones fairer than faire, by the lovely and delicate ſweetneſſe of a winning favour. In beautifull bodies grace is the life of beauty. Catullus obſerveth this difference in a compariſon he maketh betweene Quintia and Lesbia. <hi>Many,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Carm.</hi> 87.</note>, <hi>hold</hi> Quintia <hi>to be fairer: ſhe is in my opinion, white, tall, and ſtreight. Theſe particulars I do confeſſe; as for the whole, that ſhe ſhould be beautifull, I deny that; ſeeing in ſuch a great body of hers there is no comelineſſe at all, no not one crum of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe.</hi> Leſbia <hi>is beautifull indeed; for as ſhee is perfectly fair, ſo hath ſhe likewiſe ſtollen away all manner of graces from them that are moſt beautifull.</hi> Tibullus <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. iv. Eleg.</hi> 2.</note> doth alſo commend the beauty of Sulpitia, for the moſt comely demeanour it had; ſeeing ſhe could do nothing, ſhe could ſtir no where, but that her beauty was ſtill waited upon by a certain kinde of lovely grace, which did ſtealingly accompany her in all her actions, adding a moſt ſweet and pleaſing life to her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive perfections. Claudia Rufina an Engliſh Lady endued
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:11347:166"/>
with many extraordinary gifts of nature, is likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Martial <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. xi. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigr.</hi> 54.</note>, for having added to theſe good parts all the Graces which either Greece or Rome were able to affoord. The caſe ſtandeth even thus with picture: unleſſe there bee in the worke that ſame ayre and comely Grace, which is made up by the concord and agreement of ſeverall accompliſhed parts, it cannot pleaſe the beholder. Even as a lute cannot delight the hearer, unleſſe all the ſtrings from the higheſt to the loweſt being well tuned, ſtrike the eare with the ſweet harmony of a diſagreeing agreement. <hi>Apelles</hi> was excellent at this: for though that age wherein he lived was very well ſtored with all manner of rare workemen, yet did he attribute this glory eſpecially unto himſelfe: having therefore commended the other Artificers ſufficiently, hee did not ſticke to ſay, that they did lacke this Grace, though they had all other good qualities belonging to that art. See Pliny, xxxv. 10. Where the peereleſſe artificer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth by this Grace, nothing elſe but a peculiar perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Invention, Proportion, Colour, Motion, Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſo diffuſed through the whole work, that the picture we ſee doth not ſo much raviſh our ſenſes with the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Proportion, Colour, Motion, Diſpoſition, as they are compleat and perfect in themſelves, but rather as they bring all their peculiar perfections together, to atchieve the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection of an univerſall Grace indifferently, ſhewing it ſelfe in the whole worke, and in every part of it.</p>
               <p>§ 2. This is queſtionleſſe that grace, which readily and freely proceeding out of the Artificers ſpirit, cannot be taught by any rules of art: no more can aſſiduity of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſtudies helpe us to it. <hi>Whatſoever is exceſſive is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> ſayth Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. inſtit. li. viii. cap.</hi> 3.</note>. Too much care therefore is rather like to ſpoyle the comely ſweetneſſe of this Grace, than to
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:11347:167"/>
advance it; and whenſoever we doe but begin to ſtreighten the freeneſſe of it by an unſeaſonable and over curious nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſtudying, the decent comelineſſe of the work is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly gone and loſt. <hi>Whatſoever doth not become the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cannot pleaſe,</hi> ſayth Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. inſtit. lib.</hi> I, <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note>. <hi>Every thing therefore which filleth the nature of the matter well enough,</hi> ſayth the ſame Author elſewhere <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. inſtit. lib.</hi> XI, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note>, <hi>loſeth the grace it hath, unleſſe it be tempered with a certaine kinde of moderation: and a man may ſooner feele the obſervation of this point in his own privat judgement, than learne it by precepts. What is ſufficient, and how much the preſent argument may receive, cannot be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by meaſure and weight; ſeeing it is here as it is with meats, the one filleth us more than another.</hi> Hence it is that many, upon whom Nature hath ſomewhat niggardly beſtowed her beſt gifts, make good ſhift to uſe them ſoberly and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo <hi>at leaſt that they might not miſ-become them,</hi> ſayth Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> I, <hi>de Oratore.</hi>
                  </note>; <hi>for this is moſt of all to be avoided, and it is not eaſie to give precepts of this one thing.</hi> Roſcius <hi>ſayth often in my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that to become is the principal point of art, and this is the only thing which cannot be procured by Art.</hi> It is true, that art cannot procure this, yet doth it ever proceed &amp; flow out of the force of a hidden and warily concealed art: ſeeing, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be effected without art, and decencie doth alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Art. Do we not ſee how thoſe darts fly moſt handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which are hurled out moſt cunningly? Such archers likewiſe as have the ſureſt hand, uſe withall to looſe their arrowes in a more comely manner,</hi> ſayth Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. inſtit. lib.</hi> IX, <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note>. It remaineth then that we hold this grace to be the worke of a wiſely diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled art. But if any man wil needs beleeve, that ſuch a high perfection is the fruit of a fertile and forward nature, the ſame muſt for all that grant us, that <hi>in this nature it ſelf there ſhall be ſome kind of art,</hi> as the ſame Quintilian ſpeaketh <note n="*" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:11347:167"/>
For theſe two, I mean Nature and Art, are ſo cloſe coupled together, that the one may not be ſeparated from the other, if we doe intend to ſave the comelineſſe of the worke: and whoſoever meaneth to expreſſe the nature of this mightie and moſt characteriſticall vertue, the ſame muſt call it with <hi>Dionyſius Halicarnaſſenſis</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Lyſia.</note>, <hi>either a certaine felicitie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or a worke of labour and Art, or elſe a habit and facultie ariſing out of the mixture of them both:</hi> even as <hi>Dionyſius Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>

                     <hi>De ſublimi orat.</hi> § 32.</note> maintaineth that <hi>the perfection conſiſteth in a mutuall coherence of theſe two:</hi> ſee the fourth Chapter of our Firſt booke, where wee doe ſpeake ſomething more of Nature and Art concurring to the conſtitution &amp; accompliſhment of the Art.</p>
               <p>§ 3. It is then moſt evident what a hard taſke they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, which go about to recommend their memories to the following age by one or other abſolute piece of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip: ſeeing that this gracefull comelineſſe is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to the worke, unleſſe there doe moreover appeare in it ſome ſucceſfull effects of a bold and confident Facilitie. After that <hi>Plinie,</hi> as it is quoted in the firſt ſection of this preſent chapter, hath related how <hi>Apelles</hi> did challenge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe the chiefeſt praiſe in this point of Grace above all other Artificers, he goeth further on to ſomething elſe; <hi>Apelles did alſo take on him another praiſe,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>when he did admire</hi> Protogenes <hi>his worke done with exceſſive paines and too much care: for he ſaid that</hi> Protogenes <hi>in all other things was equall with him, or rather better then he thought himſelfe to be: but that</hi> Protogenes <hi>in one thing was farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to him, becauſe he knew not when to hold his hand: inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating by this memorable precept, that too much diligence is oftentimes hurtfull. Plutarch</hi> doth likewiſe make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betweene the fore-mentioned Grace and this ſame
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:11347:168"/>
bold Facilitie: <hi>the verſes of</hi> Antimachus, ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">In Timole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onte.</note>, <hi>and the pictures of</hi> Dionyſius, <hi>who both were</hi> Colophonians, <hi>having vehemencie and intenſion, ſeeme to be forcibly expreſſed and too much belaboured: but</hi> Nicomachus <hi>his pictures and</hi> Homer <hi>his verſes have this alſo beſides all the other efficacie and grace which is in them, that you would thinke them made out of hand with much eaſe.</hi> Soth doth then this excellent perfection of Grace waxe more gracefull, when it is accompanied with an unconſtrained Facilitie proceeding out of the unſtayed motions which uſe to ſtirre and to impell the free ſpirit of a moſt reſolute Artificer; whereas an unreſolved and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous lingerer doth on the contrary deface and utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the hope of Grace. <hi>Wee are to conſider in every thing, How farre forth it is to be followed,</hi> ſayth <hi>Tullie</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In Oratore.</note>, <hi>for although every thing ought to conſiſt within its owne meaſure; what is too much uſeth for all that to offend us more, than what is too little.</hi> Apelles <hi>therefore was wont to ſay, that thoſe Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters miſtake themſelves in this point, who know not what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Apollodorus</hi> the clay-worker being moſt diligent in his art, had ſuch an ill opinion of himſelfe, that he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes breake finiſhed images, not being able to ſatisfie his deſire of Art: he was therefore ſurnamed <hi>Apollodorus</hi> the mad, <hi>Plinie</hi> xxxiv, 8. <hi>Callimachus</hi> was ever wont to finde fault with his works, and knew no end of diligence; he was therefore called <hi>Cacozitechnus;</hi> leaving us a memorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of moderating our care. He made the dancing <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonian</hi> women; <hi>a moſt accompliſhed worke,</hi> ſayth <hi>Plinie</hi> in the ſame place, <hi>but that diligence defaceth in it the whole Grace of the workmanſhip.</hi> Picture therefore muſt follow a bold and careleſſe way of art, or it muſt at leaſt make a ſhew of careleſneſſe in many things. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> propoundeth unto us a lively example of this ſame ſecure and unlaboured
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:11347:168"/>
Facilitie, when he deſcribeth the picture of many little <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi> wantonly hunting a hare, and careleſly tumbling on heaps for the eagerneſſe of their ſportfull chace; <hi>the</hi> Cupids <hi>doe laugh and fall downe,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>§ 4. A heavie and difficult diligence doth then marre and quite kill the grace of the worke; whereas a light and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Facilitie of working addeth life to the worke: and it concerneth an Artificer very much that he ſhould reſolve to do with eaſe whatſoever he doth: ſee our ſecond book, <hi>cap.</hi> XI, § 7, where we touch this point a little. I muſt needs adde thus much onely, that never any Painter was ranked with the better ſort of Artiſts, except <hi>learning, ſtudie, and exercitation had firſt enabled him with this Facilitie,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quintilian</hi>

ſince it is moſt certaine that ſuch a poore and ſilly affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fineneſſe doth but weaken and breake the generous endeavours of a thoroughly heated ſpirit; beſides that too much diligence uſeth to make the worke worſe. Things not farre fetched are alwayes beſt; becauſe they doe beſt agree with the ſimplicitie and truth of Nature. Whatſoever doth on the contrary bewray an exceſſive care and ſtudie, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be gracefull and comely; becauſe it dazeleth our ſenſes with the reſplendent beames of gay-ſeeming things, not ſuffering them to ſee what is in the worke; even as ranke graſſe doth ſometimes over-ſpread a whole field in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that all the good corne being choked up cannot ſo much as peepe out. <hi>Amending it ſelfe,</hi> ſayth <hi>Quintilian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Orat. inſtit. lib.</hi> X, <hi>ca.</hi> 4.</note>, <hi>muſt have an end: there are ſome which return to every part of their worke, as if all were faultie; they thinke better of every thing which is not the ſame, even as if it were unlawfull that the firſt conceits ſhould ever be good: they doe altogether follow the practice of thoſe Phyſicians which ſeeke worke by ſlaſhing and cutting what was ſound and whole: it falleth out therefore that their workes are full of skars, void of bloud, and never a whit the better for all the care beſtowed upon them. It is then fit that there ſhould be ſomething at length which might pleaſe us, or at leaſt content us; that all our filing might be found rather to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the worke then to weare it out:</hi> ſee the younger <hi>Plinie lib.</hi> IX, <hi>epiſt.</hi> 35. To be ſhort; as in many other Arts the maine ſtrength of Art doth principally conſiſt in the warie concealement of Art; ſo doth the chiefeſt force and power of the <hi>Art of painting</hi> eſpecially conſiſt therein, that it may ſeeme no Art. <hi>But we cannot endure this,</hi> ſayth <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>§ 5. It is now evident enough that the chiefeſt comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Grace conſiſteth in a readie and unconſtrained Facilitie of Art: and if wee doe but marke it, there are in this gracefull facilitie ſuch hidden treaſures of all manner of contentment, that even the better ſort of men love to feed their greedy eyes with ſuch a goodly ſight. A picture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which ſtirreth no admiration in the heart of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, doth hardly deſerve the name of a picture; even as men of underſtanding hold him onely to be Artificer, who is able to expreſſe abundantly, accuratly, pleaſantly, lively, and diſtinctly, whatſoever his learned Invention hath ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted unto him. This is that vertue which gathereth great rings of amazed ſpectators together; which carrieth them into an aſtoniſhed extaſie, their ſenſe of ſeeing bereaving them of all other ſenſes; which by a ſecret veneration ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſtand tongue-tyed, <hi>the greatneſſe of admiration leaving no place for many applauſes,</hi> ſayth <hi>Symmachus</hi>

               <p>§ 7. Having now ſeene alreadie wherein the chiefe comelineſſe of Grace doth conſiſt, and how by a glorious conqueſt it doth ſweetly enthrall and captivate the hearts of men with the lovely chaines of due admiration and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement; having likewiſe conſidered by the way that this Grace hath no greater enemy than affectation; it is left one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we ſhould examine, by what means it may be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: although we dare not preſume to give any precepts of it; which in the opinion of Tully and Quintilian is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:11347:174"/>
impoſſible: ſince it is certaine, that this grace is not a perfection of art proceeding meerley from art, but rather a perfection proceeding from a conſummate art, as it buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe about things that are ſutable to our nature. So muſt then art and nature concur to the conſtitution of this Grace. A perfect art muſt be wiſely applied to what we are moſt given to by nature. Whoſoever hath perfect ſkill in theſe Arts loveth alwayes to be doing: and though a good artificer be likely to doe well, or at leaſt tolerably, in every thing he taketh in hand; yet is it certaine, that he ſhall doe better, and come neereſt to this comelineſſe of Grace, when the excellencie of his art buſieth it ſelfe, not with ſuch things as he loatheth, nor with ſuch things as hee is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently affected unto; but with ſuch things as are moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with his nature &amp; inward diſpoſition. <hi>We are to follow our own nature,</hi> ſayth Tul. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>and we are to meaſure our ſtudies by the rule of our nature: for it is to no purpoſe, that we ſhould ſtrive againſt nature, and follow a thing we canot attain to. This makes it alſo more appear, what maner of comlineſſe this is, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing can be decent &amp; comly in ſpight (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is) of Minerva, that is, our nature not giving way to it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this contemplation we had need to examine what every one hath of his own, &amp; to make uſe of that, without trying any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how the things which are peculiar to other men might becom us: for that becoms every man beſt, what is moſt his own. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man therefore know his owne nature, and be a ſevere judge of what is good and bad in himſelfe; leſt the Scenicall artificers peradventure might ſeem warier than we: ſeeing they doe not always chuſe the beſt fables, but ſuch as are fitteſt for them. They that do rely upon their voyce, chuſe</hi> Epigonos <hi>and</hi> Medea. <hi>They that do rely upon their geſture, chuſe</hi> Menalippa, Clytemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra.

If in the mean time one or other neceſſary occaſion driveth us to thoſe things which are ſomwhat abhorring from our nature, wee are then to bend all our care, meditation, diligence, that we might do theſe things, if not decently, yet with as little undecency as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can be; ſtudying always more to ſhun faults, than to hunt after ſuch vertues as are not affoorded us by nature.</hi> See the fourth chapter of our firſt booke, where wee do inſiſt more generally upon this point.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have ſeene that the height of Art doth chiefely conſiſt in the fore-mentioned Grace; and that this Grace muſt proceed from the perfections of an accurate inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Proportion, Colour, Life, Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not onely as each of them is perfect in it ſelfe ſeverally, but as generally out of the mutuall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them all, there doth appeare in the whole worke, and in every part of it, a certaine kinde of gracefull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſle: We have ſeene likewiſe, that this Grace is not the worke of a troubleſome and ſcrupulous ſtudy, but that it is rather perfected by the unaffected facility of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent art and forward nature equally concurring to the worke; ſo is it moſt certaine, that never any artificer could attaine the leaſt ſhadow of this grace, without the mutuall ſupport of Art and Nature: nature is to follow the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:11347:175"/>
of art, even as art is to follow the prompt readineſſe of our forward nature. Seeing then that this grace can never be accompliſhed, unleſſe all theſe things doe meet in the worke; ſo is it likewiſe evident, that even the ſelfe ſame things are requiſite to the diſcovering of the Grace. The way of begetting is the onely way of judging. Whatſoever is not ſought in his owne way, ſayth <hi>Caſſiodorus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>De divin. lection. ca.</hi> 28</note>, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be traced perfectly. They therefore doe exceedingly miſtake, who thinke it an eaſie matter to finde out and to diſcerne ſuch a high poynt of theſe profound arts. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable grace, equally diffuſed and diſperſed through the whole worke, as it is not had ſo eaſily, cannot be diſcerned ſo eaſily. Whether a picture be copious, learned, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, admirable, ſufficiently poliſhed, ſweet, whether the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and paſſions are therin ſeaſonably repreſented, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee perceived in any one part; the whole worke muſt ſhew it. Dionyſ. Longinus ſpeaketh well to the purpoſe when he ſayth <note n="*" place="margin">

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> § 1.</note>, <hi>We ſee the skil of invention, the order and diſpoſition of things, as it ſheweth it ſelf, not in one or two parts only, but in the whole compoſition of the worke, and that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 2. A way then with all thoſe, who thinke it enough if they can but confidently uſurpe the authority belonging onely to them that are well skilled in theſe arts: it will not ſerve their turne, that they doe ſometimes with a cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brow reject, &amp; ſomtimes with an affected gravity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the workes of great maſters: the neat and poliſhed age wherein we live will quickly finde them out. So did the ſelfe-conceited Megabyzus, when hee was ſitting in <hi>Zeuxis</hi> his ſhop, preſume to prattle ſomething about matters of art, even as if his big lookes and purple coat ſhould have made his unadviſed diſcourſes good; but he found himſelf very
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:11347:176"/>
much deceived: ſeeing <hi>Zeuxis</hi> did not ſticke to tell him to his face, that he was both admired &amp; reverenced of all that ſaw him, as long as he held his peace: whereas now having begun to ſpeake ſenſeleſly, hee was laughed at even of the boyes that did grinde colours. See Aelian. Var. hiſt. lib. II. cap. 2. This is then no jeaſting matter, we muſt examine with a circumſpect and judicious earneſtneſſe, whether the knitting together of ſeverall things repreſented within the compaſſe of one table, be round without roughneſſe, and learned without hardneſſe: beſides that, we are to conſider more diſtinctly, how the perſpicuous diſpoſition flowing out of a grave and profitable invention, inſtructeth our judgements: how a proportionable deſigne trimmed up with pleaſing colours delighteth our ſences; how a lively reſemblance of action and paſſion raviſheth our ſoule, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and transforming with a ſweet violence the preſent ſtate of our mind to what we ſee repreſented in the picture. For it goeth heere with painters, as it goeth with orators and Poëts, they muſt all teach, delight, and moove: <hi>It is their duty,</hi> ſayth Tully <note n="*" place="margin">De opt. gen. Orat.</note>, <hi>that they ſhould teach; it is for their owne credit that they ſhould delight; it is altogether requiſite that they ſhould moove and ſtirre our minde. Witty things teach us: curious things delight us: grave things moove us: and he is the beſt Artiſt, who is beſt provided of all theſe things. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever on the contrary is meanly provided of them, he is but a meane one; even as he is the worſt who hath ſmall ſtore of them: for naughty painters are in this ſence as well called Painters, as the beſt. If any one in the meane time ſtudying to be grave, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the opinion of wit: or if on the contrary, he had rather ſeem witty than gorgeous; the ſame, though he may be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are tolerable, yet is he none of the better ſort; ſeeing that is beſt onely, what hath all manner of praiſes.</hi>

§ 3. I would not have a man ſo ſevere and peremptory in his judgement, as to examine every thing nicely according to the moſt exact courſe and apprehenſion of art: ſomthing muſt be indulged unto the wits of great Maſters: provided onely that we doe excuſe ſmall miſtakes in them, and not ſuch faults as may ſeeme groſſe and monſtrous. Hee forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne condition, and doth not remember himſelfe a man, who will not beare with other mens errours. <hi>The good</hi> Homer <hi>doth ſomtimes ſlumber and overſee himſelfe,</hi> ſayth Horace in his Poëticall Art. <hi>Let the nature of man be never ſo perfect,</hi> ſayth Diod. Siculus <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. xxvi.</note>, <hi>yet can ſhe not pleaſe in all things:</hi> For neither <hi>Phidias,</hi> though he was wonderful in his ivory works; nor <hi>Praxiteles,</hi> though he did moſt skilfully mixe the paſſions of the ſoule with his works of ſtone; nor Apelles and Parrhaſius, though they did raiſe the Art of painting to the greateſt height by their cunningly tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red colours; could attaine to this, that they ſhould ſhew an unblameable patterne of their skill. They were men, and miſtooke themſelves often, by reaſon of that weakeneſſe which uſeth to be in man: beſides that, they were ſomtimes overcome with the height and excellencie of the matters they ventured upon. <hi>Horace</hi> therefore giveth us good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when he doth ſo highly commend this diſcreet mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Whoſoever mixeth profit with pleaſure,</hi> ſayth hee <note n="*" place="margin">De Arte.</note>, <hi>the ſame doth hit the principall point of art. Yet are there ſome overſights that deſerve our pardon. Lute ſtrings, do not alwayes ſound as our hand and minde would have them, but they yeeld us very often a ſharpe note, when we looke for a flat one. A bow doth not alwaies hit what we aime at. Even ſo where there are many things that do excell in the worke and make it ſhine. I ſhal never be offended at a few ſpots, cauſed either by heedleſneſſe, or elſe by that weakneſſe which is incident to the nature of man.</hi> The
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:11347:177"/>
younger Pliny ſtudieth to induce us to the ſame moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by another ſimilitude. <hi>Though every one of us uſeth in the ordinary courſe of banquets to forbeare many diſhes,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> II, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5.</note>, <hi>yet do we all commend the whole feaſt: neither do the meats our ſtomack refuſeth, leſſen the pleaſure of what we like.</hi> Wee are then to judge, and that rigorouſly enough, ſeeing it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted here, that every man ſhould give a ready account of his owne liking and diſliking, without ſuffering himſelfe to be hurried about by the wavering opinions of other men: but nevertheleſſe muſt the ſeveritie of our forward judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be brideled by a circumſpect and wary moderation, leſt our unadviſed raſhneſſe in judging make us like them that are eſteemed prodigall and laviſh of their judgements: they reject ſome things in the exquiſite workes of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt workemen, as being puffed up; which in the opinion of more underſtanding ſpectators, are full of ſtatelineſſe and magnificence: they reprehend ſome things as beeing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, which in more ſober minds are held commendable for their confident boldneſſe: they condemne ſome things as being ſuperfluous and immoderate, which in ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe but abound in a temperate plenteouſneſſe. Wee ought to take heed of this, ſeeing there is a great difference, as the younger Pliny ſpeaketh <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> IX, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 26.</note>, <hi>Whether we do note blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy or excellent things.

Having outwardly provided what may be good for our eyes, it is next that wee ſhould ſeriouſly weigh and conſider every part of the work, returning to it againe and again, even ten and ten times if need be. For our ſenſe doth ſeldom at the firſt judg right of theſe curioſities, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Arbitrator, and miſtaketh many things: all the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truth of our judgement muſt proceed onely from reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Although the ſeveral circumſtances of all arts, and almoſt of our whole life, are occaſioned by the miniſtery of our ſenſes,</hi> ſaith Boëthius <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Li. I. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. cap.</hi> 9.</note>, <hi>yet is there no certainty of judgement, nor appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of truth in our ſences, if they are not accompanied with reaſon. For our ſenſe is alike corrupted with what is too great and too ſmall; ſeeing it canot perceive the leaſt things by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſmalneſſe, and it is often confounded with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</hi> And again in another place; Harmonica <hi>is a faculty,</hi> ſaith hee <note n="*" place="margin">

Sence doth confuſedly marke what commeth neareſt unto the thing percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but Reaſon diſcerneth the ſincerity therof, and buſieth it ſelfe about the ſeverall differences. Sence therefore as it fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth confuſed things, and things approaching unto the truth, ſo</hi>

                  <hi>doth it receive his integritie from reaſon: but reaſon, as it fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the integritie, ſo doth it receive from ſenſe a confuſed ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and a ſimilitude approaching unto the truth: for ſenſe conceiveth no integritie, but cometh as neere as can be: reaſon on the contrary doth diſcerne and determine:</hi> ſee <hi>Macrobius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>lib.</hi> VII, <hi>Saturnal. cap.</hi> 14. This ought therefore to be our chiefeſt care, that wee ſhould not onely goe with our eyes over the ſeverall figures repreſented in the worke, but that we ſhould likewiſe ſuffer our mind to enter into a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſideration of what wee ſee expreſſed; not otherwiſe then if wee were preſent, and ſaw not the counterfeited image but the reall performance of the thing: which having well obſerved, the very picture it ſelfe will inſtantly lead us to the principall figures. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in the picture of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiaraus</hi> ſeemeth to inſinuate thus much: for having rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many and ſtrange adventures that befell unto ſeverall warriers as they were a fighting under the walls and at the gates of the Citie <hi>Thebes; But theſe,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">Icon. lib.

               </p>
               <p>§ 6. By this it may be inferred that the moſt earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of our curious mind ought chiefly to employ it ſelfe about the chiefeſt and moſt remarkable things. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in the picture of the Fiſhermen giveth us an evident exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>not to goe over every little thing,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">Icon. li.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:11347:179"/>
the deſcription of that picture it ſelfe. The chiefeſt things therefore require our chiefeſt attention; and whoſoever contenteth himſelf with ſome ſmall things he fell upon firſt, the ſame doth little remember that ſtately magnificence the Lovers of Art muſt as well accuſtome themſelves unto in judging, as the workmen in working: <hi>if any man doth not ſee the whole beauty of the</hi> Olympian Jupiter, <hi>which is ſo great and ſo wonderfull,</hi> ſayth <hi>Lucian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">De Conſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendâ hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</note>, <hi>if he doth not commend it, nor report it to others that are ignorant of it, but ſtumbleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the handſome workmanſhip of his well-carved foot-ſtoole and upon his well-proportioned pantofle, rehearſing theſe things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefully; would not you thinke him like unto a man that doth not ſee the roſe it ſelfe, but fixeth his whole contemplation upon the thornes and prickles which grow neere the roote?</hi> The true way how to conſider pictures and ſtatues, is moſt plainly ſet downe in the books of Images made by the elder and youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> as also in <hi>Calliſtratus</hi> his Deſcription of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: whoſoever readeth their workes with attention, ſhall queſtionleſſe finde his deſire fully ſatisfied. There are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in many other ancient Authors divers curious and neat expreſſions to be found, able both to delight the reader and to informe his judgement in the right manner of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining workes of Art: but among a thouſand examples that might be alleadged here, wee ſhall inſiſt onely upon <hi>Claudians</hi> deſcription of <hi>Amphinomus</hi> and <hi>Anapus</hi> their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. <hi>Behold how the brothers ſweat under a venerable burden,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">

Though they ſupport their parents with their neckes, yet doe they uphold them with their hands, confidently lifting up their heads &amp; haſtening their pace. The olde couple is mounted up on high and carried by two ſonnes, entangling them with a ſweet and lovely let. Doe</hi>

                  <hi>not you ſee how the old man pointeth to the fire? how the frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mother calleth upon the Gods? Feare ſetteth their haire on end, the mettall it ſelfe growing pale in their amazed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. You may ſee in the young men a moſt couragious hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, being feareleſſe for themſelves, though fearefull for their burden: their cloakes are borne backe by the winde: one of them lifteh up his right hand, being content to hold his father with the left: the other foldeth both his hands in a knot, remembring how the weaker ſexe was to be ſaved by a more warie toile. It muſt not goe unobſerved, what the hands of the Artificer brought quietly to paſſe in the worke: for though their conſanguinitie maketh them very like one another; the one for all that cometh neereſt unto the mother, the other unto the father: their unlike yeares receive ſuch a temperature by the skill of Art, that the parents are repreſented in each of their countenances: and the workman making a new difference between two neerely reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling brothers, hath diſtinguiſhed their countenances by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their pietie.</hi> It is apparent in this example how a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and underſtanding ſpectator goeth over all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in the worke: and as he cannot abide that his curioſitie ſhould ſpend it ſelfe about matters of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſo doth he very ſeriouſly obſerve the moſt ſtrange miracles of the noble Art, as they doe diſplay themſelves in ſuch a noble argument.</p>
               <p>§ 7. As it is then evident that our curioſitie may not buſie it ſelfe too much about poore and frivolous matters, ſo muſt wee on the contrary endeavour to conceive the whole ſhew of the repreſented matters with a large and freely diffuſed apprehenſion; to the end that wee might compare the chiefeſt circumſtances of the Argument with our premeditated and fore-conceived images: neither is it a hard and difficult worke to recollect our memory and to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:11347:180"/>
renew the remembrance of things upon the leaſt ſight of a repreſented image; it is done in an inſtant: <hi>our remembrance is a quicke and eaſie thing,</hi> ſayth <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Diſſert. xxviii.</note>, <hi>for as bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are eaſily mooved muſt firſt be ſtirred by a hand or any thing which ſetteth them a going, and having once received ſuch a beginning of their motion, they keepe it for a good while: even ſo the mind, having received of ſenſe a ſmall beginning of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, runneth on infinitly, remembring all what is to be remembred. Our ſenſes therefore, which ſtand as it were at the entry of the mind, having received the beginning of any thing, and having proffered it to the mind; the mind likewiſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this beginning, and goeth over all what followeth: the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of a long and ſlender pike being but lightly ſhaken, the motion runneth thorough the whole length of the pike, even to the ſpeares-head; and whoſoever ſhaketh the beginning of a long ſtretched out rope, ſendeth the motion to the ropes end; ſo doth our mind need but a ſmall beginning to the remembrance of the whole matter.</hi>

               <p>When a table of huntings is repreſented to the ſenſe, the mind alſo will ſuddenly enter into a moſt ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of hunting affaires, and by a lively and active Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation repreſent to it ſelfe all the painefull pleaſures of that manly paſtime: the firſt thoughts will exhibite a frequent aſſembly of youthful gallants enflamed with exceeding love of that ſport, preventing the light, even while every foote they ſet doth leave its print in the dewie graſſe, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coupling the moſt aſſured finders, the dogs themſelves with ſilent geſtures craving freedome, ſome rounding and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſhadie woods, while the hounds with full libertie ranging the coverts doe by the diligent ſuite of quick-ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted noſes catch a ſelfe-betraying ſent.

               <p>§ 8. Wee have ſhewed already in the fift chapter of our firſt Booke, that Lovers of art ought to ſtore up in their minde the perfect Images of all manner of things; to the end that they might have them alwayes at hand, when any workes of Art are to be conferred with them. Here it is furthermore required, that all thoſe who meane to enter into a judicious conſideration of matters of art, muſt by the means of theſe Images accuſtome their mind to ſuch a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſentation of what they ſee expreſſed in the picture, as if they ſaw the things themſelves and not their reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance onely. <hi>Theon,</hi> a moſt famous Painter, having made the picture of an armed man who ſeemed to runne moſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly on his enemies that depopulated the country round about, he did thinke it good not to propound the picture before he had provided a trumpetter to ſound an alarme ſomewhere hard by; the trumpet therefore being heard, the picture was likewiſe brought forth ſuddenly at the ſame inſtant. <hi>The ſound of the trumpet,</hi> ſayth <hi>Aelian</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Li.

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:11347:181"/>
to exſpect nothing elſe but an invaſion of armed and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly reſolved men. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> commendeth unto us this way of conſidering pictures: for when he goeth about to teach a young lad how to looke upon pictures, he wiſheth him to take this courſe: <hi>Will you, good youth,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note>, <hi>that wee diſcourſe about theſe Ilands as out of a ſhip, even as if wee did ſaile round about them in the ſpring-time, when</hi> Zephyrus <hi>refreſheth the Sea, gently ſtirring it with a coole blaſt of his owne? To the end therefore that you might willingly forget the ſhore, and that you might take all this to be the ſea; not a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and boiſterous one; neither altogether quiet and calme; but a navigable ſea and filled with a good gale of winde; behold, wee are embarked already, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark here, I pray, how <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> a man exceeding well ſkilled in theſe things, taketh the ſpectator along with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ſhip boord, willeth him forget the ſhore and view e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of the repreſented circumſtances as out of a ſhip; eſteeming that his mind could not apprehend the ſeverall parts of the picture rightly, unleſſe with an imaginary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence it ſhould firſt ſaile about, conferring the freſh and newly conceived Images with the picture it ſelfe. So may it likewiſe be inferred out of this, that they are likely to judge beſt of the reſemblance of many things, who have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had the opportunitie to acquaint their eyes with the things themſelves. It is prettie indeed and much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to this purpoſe, what <hi>Athenaeus</hi>

               <p>§ II. This facilitie of judging, as it teacheth their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed eyes to diſcerne betweene originals and copies; ſo doth it likewiſe inable them to ſee the difference which is betweene antient and moderne workes. <hi>Nothing commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth pictures ſo much,</hi> ſayth Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Li. viii, c.</hi> 3</note>, <hi>as that authoritie given them by age, which no art can imitate.</hi> All are not of L. Mummius his minde, who was ſo ignorant in theſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that hee made no difference betweene old and new
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:11347:183"/>
workes. For when he at the taking of Corinth, agreed with ſome men to bring a world of rare &amp; antient pictures &amp; ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues into Italy; hee foretold them that undertooke the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That they ſhould take heed of loſing any, which if they did, that they were then to reſtore new ones in ſtead of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. See Vell. Paterc. lib. II. hiſt. cap. 13. But this was his groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As for the other more refined and elegant men of that and the following ages, they knew well enough what difference there was between old and new workemanſhip, and how much the pleaſantneſſe of great and nimble wits is revived by theſe delightſome antiquities. They held them therefore in a reverend admiration, <hi>even as men uſe to adore groves conſecrated for their antiquity,</hi> ſayth Quintil. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Li. x. cap.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>in which the great and antient ſtumps do not ſo much draw our eyes with their pleaſant ſhew, as with a religious horrour that ſtriketh the heart of the beholders.</hi> Tully declareth himſelfe to have beene of that minde. <hi>Antiquity is in great eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with me,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">De perfecto Orat.</note>, <hi>neither doe I ſo much require what ſhe wanteth, as I doe commend what ſhee hath; ſeeing I hold the things ſhe hath, farre better than the things ſhe wanteth.</hi> And againe in another place <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. III. de Orat.</note>, <hi>It is no eaſie thing to tel the cauſe why we are ſooneſt of all by a certaine kinde of loathing and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, abalienated from ſuch things as do at the firſt ſight very much delight and vehemently ſtir our ſences. How much more flour ſhing are all things for their gayneſſe and variety in new pictures than in old ones? Theſe things for all that, though wee are at the firſt very much taken with them, doe never delight us long. Whereas on the contrary in old pictures, we are moſt of all affected with their decaying horridneſſe.</hi> Obſerve here in the meane time, that other Authors, though Tully thinketh it an hard matter, alledge a double reaſon of this reſpect wee beare the antient workes. Dionyſ. Halycarnaſſenſis giveth
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:11347:183"/>
us one reaſon, when he maintaineth <note n="*" place="margin">In Iſaeo.</note>, That the antient pictures in a wonderfull ſimplicity of colours drew their chiefeſt commendation from a more accurate and gracefull deſigne. The new pictures on the contrary being but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly deſigned, ſtood moſt of all upon the manifold mixture of their colours, and upon an affectation of light and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. See Themiſtius alſo, Orat. de Amic. where he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the very ſame point. The other reaſon ſeemes to flow out of the former: for as the firſt reaſon preferreth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient workes before the new, in regard of their graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſo doth the ſecond attribute unto the old workes a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of majeſty, yet ſo, that it was their ſimplicitie made them majeſtical. Porph. ſayth <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. II. de abſtinentiâ.</note>, That the new images of the gods are admired for the dignity of the work, but the ancient are reverenced for the ſimplicity of the worke, as being more ſutable to the majeſty of the gods. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> likewiſe <note n="*" place="margin">In Corinth.</note> ſpeaking of Daedalus, ſayth that his works were not very handſome to looke on, but that there was in them a certaine kinde of divine majeſty which did become them very much. Silius Italicus <note n="*" place="margin">Sub finem lib. xiv.</note> doth alſo note this peculiar property in the antient images of gods, <hi>That they kept as yet the godhead beſtowed upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by art.</hi> As many therfore as had uſed their eyes to ſuch ſights, did eaſily diſcerne the old works from the new: ſo was there good reaſon they ſhould labor to attain to this faculty of judging, becauſe the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Cheaters were wonderful buſy in thoſe times, and it was an ordinary practiſe of many to couzen the unskilful buyers with a counterfeit ſhew of antiquitie. See Phaedr. l. v. Fab. in prol. See Martial likewiſe, lib. viii. Epigr. 6 &amp; 34.</p>
               <p>§ 12. Seeing therefore that the ſayd conſuetude or accuſtomance of our eyes doth ſo much enable us, as that wee can upon the firſt view readily diſcerne originall pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:11347:184"/>
from Copies, and antient workes from moderne; we might be very well ſatisfied, eſteeming the daily practice of a curious eye to be the chiefeſt meanes whereby we do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to ſuch a facilitie of judging: but that the king <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus</hi> propoundeth unto us another meanes, which being added to the former exerciſe, is likely to quicken our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much more, and to endue it with a moſt ready and unfallible facility of judging. Theodericus his words are taken out of a Writ directed to the Preſident of Rome, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the chuſing of a ſufficient Surveyor or Architect: <hi>The reputation of the Roman fabricke,</hi> ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Apud Caſſ. Var. lib. vii. ſorm.</hi> 15.</note>, <hi>ought to have an expert Architect: that this wonderfull collection which is within the walls might be ſuccoured by diligence, and that the moderne face of the worke might be well contrived and ordered. For our largeſſe doth not faile in this ſtudy, but that we reſolve to renew antient workes, by ſupplying their defects, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre new workes with the glory of antiquitie. Theſe things ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do require a moſt skilfull man, leſt among ſo many moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious antient things, he himſelfe ſeeme like unto the metall they are made of, and ſhew himſelfe uncapable of what cunning Antiquity made palpable in them. Let him therefore reade the books of the Antients, and take ſome leiſure to improve himſelf, leſt he be found to know leſſe than thoſe in whoſe place he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a moſt worthy care this King tooke, to ſee the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of the city every where renewed, and yet is it more, that he would not neglect to give his advice, how a skilfull overſeer of antiquities ſhould fit himſelfe better to the charge he was to undergoe. <hi>Let him reade the Bookes of the Antients,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>and draw further inſtruction out of them.</hi> It is right it ſhould be ſo: for as wee ſhewed in the firſt chapter of this our third Booke, that no Artificer may
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:11347:184"/>
ever hope to attaine to the perfection of theſe arts, unleſſe he be thorowly inſtructed with all manner of arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; even ſo muſt we ſay here the ſame of lovers of Art, that they muſt be filled with great varietie of learning. It may be very well, that an unlearned lover of art ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and diſcerhe the Artificers skil, out of his deſigne, colours, and ſuch like things, delighting himſelfe eſpecially in theſe parts of picture: but much further he cannot go; it belongeth onely to them that are learned indeed, to judge moreover of the invention, to conſider whether every fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure hath his due place, and bee inſpired with ſuch lively paſſions as the preſent occaſion of the repreſented hiſtorie requireth. Without this purifying of our wit, enriching of our memory, enabling of our judgement, inlarging of our conceit, which is commonly called by the name of learning, we ſhall never be able to underſtand the drift of an hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call invention aright, and it may be we ſhall approve of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impertinencies committed againſt the nature of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The Ancients beſides all this, as we have ſhewed before in the 6 Section of this preſent Chapter, inform and direct our judgements in the true way of judging; &amp; which is more yet, there are ſcattered heere and there in their workes ſuch compleat deſcriptions of beauty as may ſerve to worke after and to judge by. But of this point, which perchance may ſeeme ſomewhat paradoxicall, we have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died elſewhere to give ſufficient proofe.</p>
               <p>§ 13. What we have ſayd already, may ſerve for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction into a ſetled way of judging, and wee would willingly end with this, if wee had not ſomething to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the by-workes, commonly called <hi>Parerga</hi> in the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Greeke and Latine Authors. Parerga <hi>are called ſuch things,</hi> ſayth Quintilian <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> II. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note>, <hi>as are added to the worke for to</hi>

                  <hi>adorne it.</hi> Pliny doth likewiſe expreſſe the ſame: Protoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſayth he <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> xxxv, <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note>, <hi>when he painted at Athens in the porch of</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva's <hi>Temple that famous ſhip called</hi> Paralus, <hi>with another ſhip called</hi> Hemionis, <hi>he added alſo many other little Gallies among the things which painters call</hi> Parerga.

                  </note> ſeemeth to call theſe additions, <hi>Sweet ſeaſonings of picture.</hi> But becauſe the Artificers goe over theſe workes ſlightly and with a light hand, ſo is it that we doe likewiſe for the moſt part examine them more negligently. <hi>We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the by-works of workemen but ſlenderly,</hi> ſayth Plutarch <note n="*" place="margin">Cur Pythia nunc non red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat oracula carmine.</note>, <hi>for they ſtudy onely to be pleaſant in many of them; neither doe they alwayes avoyd in them what is to ſmall purpoſe and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</hi> If we doe finde in the meane while, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers hit the true force and facilitie of grace better in theſe ſudden things than in the worke it ſelfe, yet muſt wee never be ſo inconſiderate in our judgement, as to preferre the by-work before the work: <hi>Protogenes</hi> his example may teach us, how much the indiſcretion of ſuch ſpectators diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth the Artificer. Among many excellent Donaries that did adorne the city Rhodes, the picture of <hi>Jalyſus</hi> was much renowmed; a painted Satyr alſo ſtanding neere a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, whereupon the picture of a Partridge was to be ſeene. The picture of the partridge being newly hung there, drew the eyes of all ſorts of men ſo much, that the moſt excellent picture of <hi>Jalyſus</hi> grew contemptible, and no body did any more regard it. <hi>Protogenes</hi> therefore finding himſelf much
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:11347:185"/>
vexed, that the by-worke ſhould be preferred before the worke it ſelfe, having aſked leave of the Church-wardens, did put out the bird. See <hi>Strabo, lib. XIV, Geograph.</hi> Such another company of unadviſedly and impertinently jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Spectators made <hi>Zeuxis</hi> likewiſe cry out, <hi>Theſe men commend the mud of our Art.</hi> See <hi>Lucian</hi> in <hi>Zeuxide.</hi>
