            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here cannot be a better expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for removing the calamities and miseries of this languishing Kingdom, then cleerly and plainly to informe the World, and the Consciences and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings of all men, who they are that will not suffer the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Peace to returne to us. For however the inclinations of many are so seduced, and their understandings so corrupted, that they are not, or seem not, to be convinced of the horror and odiousnesse of this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet none have owned so much blood-thirstinesse, so much folly &amp; inhumanity, as to declare to the People, That Peace is not good for them, (though they have used all possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes and Engines of Wit, Malice, and Perjury, to involve them in a desperate and eternall Warre) presuming that whatsoever absence there is of courage and conscience, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Loyalty, that they are yet too wise and decerning in their own interest, bare-faced to affect Famine, Ruine and Desolation, and therefore in the middest of their blood and Rapine, in the very act of invading and infesting the Kingdom with forraigne Forces, and basely betraying the Wealth, Blood, and honour of their Country to strangers, they would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51187:3"/>
faine be thought solicitous and importunate for Peace.</p>
            <p>Vpon this ground, and for this reason (how perverse soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the hearts of many are to the cleerest evidence, and how insolently soever even this overture was entertained, and since scornfully commented on) 'tis necessary to publish to the World, the last attempt made by His Majesty, to prevent the further effusion of Christian English Blood, with all the circumstances both of the sending and reception, that all men may see the difference between the spirit and temper of a just and gratious King, and of men whose Pride and Ambition have broken the bounds prescribed to them by Law and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and how hard it is for Persons who have once assumed and usurped a power too great for them, to quit and depart from that power, though they see it inconsistent with the preservation of themselves and their Country; and that all men may confesse (what Iudgement soever it shall please God to lay upon this miserable Kingdome) that he, to whom he intrusted it, left no means unattempted, that either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique consultations, or private conjectures could think expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to redeeme it from those Iudgements; and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe descended (notwithstanding the greatest discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and provocation that ever Prince endured) in his Princely and Fatherly care of his People, to all imaginable Arts and Offices, which might remove the present, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the growing mischiefes.</p>
            <p>His Majesty having alwaies principally chosen (though he hath consented to, and embraced all Councells and occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that looked that way) those seasons to desire and solicite for Peace, in which he might be understood to have some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in Warre, (witnesse his Messages and Declarations after the Battell at <hi>Edge-Hill,</hi> after his taking of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> after the reliefe of <hi>Newarke,</hi>) no sooner freed himselfe from the attendance of Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> Army (having routed a considerable part of it, taken tenne Peece of Cannon, and some principall Officers prisoners) and put himselfe into the head of an Army much superior in common understanding to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51187:3"/>
force he was to contend with; then he considered how to prevent that effusion of blood, which a Battell would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and to procure such a Peace, as seemed to be wished by those, with whom he was to fight, and was the same he had alwayes desired. It was too evident upon so many, and a very late refusall, that such an overture would meet with nothing but scorne and insolence at <hi>Westminster,</hi> where without forme or Liberty of debate, Councells, and Resolutions are imposed by the fury and violence of those, who are too much concerned in the guilt and benefit of the Rebellion, to submit themselves to the old Lawes and Government. And many were of opinion that the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> himselfe was so conscious of being made an instrument of so much misery and devastation to his Country, so sensible of the condition of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of <hi>England,</hi> of the Religion, Lawes, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdome, by this Invasion of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that he would willingly embrace any opportunity to relieve and redeeme himselfe, and his fellow Subjects from that thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and captivity he could not but see designed for them, and to preserve the Religion, Lawes, and Priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which he was bound and trusted even by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Generall to defend, and which he saw without a speedy Peace could not be preserved. Hereupon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty having drawne His Army to <hi>Liskard</hi> within very few miles of the Earles Forces, on the sixth of <hi>August</hi> vouchsafed to send a Letter, all written with His owne Royall Hand, to the Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> (then at <hi>Listithen</hi>) in these words.</p>

                  <p>ESSEX, I have been very willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that when ever there should be such a conjuncture as to put it in your power to effect that happy settlement of this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51187:4"/>
miserable Kingdome, (which all good men desire) you would lay hold of it. That season is now before you, you have it at this time in your power to redeeme your Country and the Crowne, and to oblige your King in the highest degree, (an Action certainly of the greatest Piety, Prudence and Honour) such an Opportunity as perhaps no Subject before you hath ever had, or after you shall have. To which there is no more required, but that you joyne with Mee heartily and really, in the setling of those things which we have both professed constantly to be our only aimes. Let us doe this, and if any shall be so foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unnaturall as to oppose their Kings, their Countries, and their own good, we will make 'em happy (by Gods blessing) even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wills. The only impediment can be want of mutuall Confidence, I promise it you on my part, as I have endeavour'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it on yours, by my Letter to <hi>Hertford</hi> from <hi>Evesham.</hi> I hope this will perfect it, when (as I here doe) I shall have engag'd unto you the word of a King, that you joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>This Letter was delivered by the Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi>; the Earle having read it, Master <hi>Richard</hi> (who attended on the Lord <hi>Beauchamp</hi>) told him, that he was to desire a safe passe for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Harding</hi> to come to him, who had authority from His Majesty to make particular Propositions in order to Peace; his Answer was, he would not permit M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Harding</hi> to come to him, neither would he have any Treaty with the King; whereupon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Richard</hi> replyed, that he was commanded from His Majesty to let him know his very earnest desire of Peace, to prevent that ruine and desolation which would inevitably ensue this unnaturall Warre; that the Peace His Majesty desired, should be established by the settlement of the true Protestant Religion, the Lawes of the Land, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subject and the Priviledges of Parliament, and that the Earle might be assured that this was His Majesties Reall Intention, His Majesty would give any security He
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51187:5"/>
could propose, as well by the Trust, Power, and Confidence he would put in himselfe, as by any other the most solemne way of engagement that could be devised. The Earle seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not moved with what was said to him, was then desired to returne an Answer to His Majesties Letter, he replyed he would make none, and so turned away.</p>
            <p>This strange neglect of His Majesty and His Message, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no other effect with His Majesty then an opinion, that there could be no reason, for a man to refuse all that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to desire, but onely a doubt in the security of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which no man could so well aske, as His Majesty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe could offer, and therefore His Majesty was pleased, that they by whose assistance he was principally to manage the Warre, should be his security for a Peace; and so the next day after His Majesty understood what reception his Letter had, this other, under the hands of the chiefe Officers of His Army, was sent to the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> in these words.</p>
