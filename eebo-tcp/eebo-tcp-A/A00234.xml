            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

conuaied to the King, confirmed all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by letters his maieſtie had intelligence of, and
diſcloſed alſo, what wayes, and meanes they had

in the Reregard of them vndiſcouered certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies

            <p>This one thing remayneth yet in this report vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
which I cannot any way omit, and all true

day of Iuly alſo: Some ſay the remnaut is retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

hoped they ſhall haue as infortunate ſucceſſe, as they
haue had hetherto: no other reaſon I can aſſigne
thereof, but this, that God now in theſe letter times
vouchſafeth to bring things to ſpeedie euen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there
by to haſten the comming of his Sonne to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for that hee hath promiſed to ſhorten thoſe

both likely to bee ſhortened, and drawe to an ende.
For who doubteth but as that butcherly Citie,
(<hi>Rome</hi> I meane) and bloudie Nation was firſt
founded in bloud, (the one Brother bathing his
hands in the bloud of the other) ſo ſhee ſhall ende in
bloud and abominable deſolation, as her ſtiffenecked
Siſter <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did before her. And to beleeue this
I am ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather incited, becauſe I both heare
and ſee daily by the omnipotent power, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched
arme of GOD, that both that Citie, that
Kingdome, and all the friends and adherents of the
ſame, doo come to perpetuall ruine, and vtter deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as is now exemplifled by the noble Rebels, and
rebellious Nobles of <hi>France:</hi> for who eſtéemeth

<pb facs="tcp:23599:7"/>
that irreligiouſly reſiſt their God, and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

eyther in inward Conſcience, or outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation,
if they were not euen thoſe, on whom God
predeſtinated to powre his dreadfull and execrable
vengeance, permitting them like caſtaway <hi>Cayne,</hi>
no place of ſafegard, but to become runnagates ouer
all the fare of the earth.</p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon alſo forcible enough I haue to
perſwade me, that euen now the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
is falling, and ſhortly (the Lorde of hoſtes
knowes how ſoone) will fall, for that another piller
of his chayre, or rather a mayne proppe of his paui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2+ letters">

For within theſe fewe dayes, not a moneth ſithence,

A Kingdome (ſaith our Sauiour) deuided in itſelfe,

ſmall things come to perfection: ſo by diſcorde the

euer haue béen in the Worlde, bend to deſtruction.
Weigh the ſtate of the 4. Monarchies both flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing

and originall of their decaye, and yee ſhall finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

come nigher, what was the firſt cauſe of planting
the Goſpell (for which ſo many haue, and yet ſpend
their deareſt bloud in <hi>France</hi>) but their firſt ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of common quiet, their vnſpeakeable butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

of God to none other end, but to raiſe vp freſh
feedes, and nouriſh the increaſe of the Goſpell, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

This did <hi>France,</hi> and wee are daily to hope,
and howerly to pray for the like of <hi>Spayne:</hi> The
Lord open their eyes to diſcerne white from black,
light from darkenes, truth from errour in due time
according to his good will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>But leauing <hi>Spayne,</hi> let vs returne agayne to
<hi>France,</hi> from wherlie euery day (the Lord for his
merries ſake increaſe it) are heard bliſſefull and moſt
happie notes, his Maieſties affayres ſucceſſiuely
proſpering an all ſides. For ſithence the departine
of our Souldiers from <hi>London,</hi> which was on the
23. 24. 25. and 26. dayes of Iuly laſt, vnto this 12.
of Auguſt, beſides the Newes already ſet downe,
many matters of great importance haue chaunced,
the veritie whereof (for that I cannot attayne, and
learne the circumſtances directly) I paſſe them ouer
in ſilence, onely of this paſſell inſuing, I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
credible information, that on the ſixt day of this
moneth, being the 16. after their computation at
<pb facs="tcp:23599:8"/>
               <hi>Bloys,</hi> his Maieſties Forces all met, and royally co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
themſelues together, at what time the braue
worthies and warlike Gallants of <hi>Germany</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
on horſebacke in Martiall order, euery one
throughly furniſhed with all habiliments neceſſarie,
were firſt welcomed by his Maieſtie, and entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of the Campe with a peale of ordinance ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But whereas in the letter (from whence I cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
out this Newes) all his Forces be named, and
yet no mention made of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I ſuppoſe hée
meant it by the forces of the <hi>Almaygnes</hi> onely, and
thoſe his own ſubiects that were ſent out of <hi>Brytain</hi>
to ioyne with his Maieſties hoaſt there, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
For there is newes come lately, that the
Earle with his companies remaine yet about
<hi>Deipe,</hi> there ſtaying a while on weightie conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
till they heare further. But how euer it bee,
this is moſt certaine, that his Maieſtie hath a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
armie, beſides thoſe warlike troupes the right
Honorable Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> is to come with, who
how they were appointed, is knowne to al <hi>England,</hi>
and I neede not now diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Thus farre concerning the proſperous ſucceſſe,
and fortunate progreſſe of this mighty Prince, whom
the Lorde hath preſerued from time to time, from
yeare to yeare, day to day, hower to hower, ſo many
times, yeares, dayes, and howers moſt miraculoufly
from all the furious inuaſions, and cancared conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
of all his enemies, and made him to triumphe
ouer them, outliuing the moſt part, reclayming by
his vertues the better ſort, and taming by policie the
peruerſe and obſtinate, being ſnatched from the
chawes of the Lyons, deliuered from the gates of
Death, and reſerued from infinite perills (as the
wide world confeſſeth) by diuine prouidence, to none
<pb facs="tcp:23599:9"/>
other end, but to declare the wonderous workes of
the Lorde, and ſhew forth his mightie acts vnto the
Princes of the earth, and eſpecially that Man of ſin,
and ſtrumpet of <hi>Babylon,</hi> foſter-father of brauls and
battayles among Chriſtian Princes, and generally
the Bloudſucker, Butcher, and tormentour of all
Europe, whome God in due time at his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
will by the hand of this his annoynted (as hee
did by <hi>Dauid</hi> fighting againſt the vncircumciſed,
<hi>Philiſtin,</hi>) terrifie, torment, ſcourge, and confound,
which he hath begon by his <hi>Engliſh Debora</hi> firſt, and
wil finiſh in this his Champion, (making them both
mirrours for all Potentates) that all the world, and
eſpecially the kingdome of Antichriſt may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that there is a God that ruleth in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and
protecteth the houſe of <hi>Iaacob,</hi> making his enemies
his footeſtooles. The Lord in mercy graunt it, to the
comfort of his little flock, the aboliſhment of ſinne,
confuſion of his enemies, and eſtabliſhment of his
owne glorie in <hi>Sion,</hi> and let all faithfull Soldiers,
and loyall ſubiects ſay, Amen, and crie in feruent
zeale of ſpirit, Lord Ieſus come quickely, euen ſo.
Amen.</p>
