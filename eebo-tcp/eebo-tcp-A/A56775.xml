                  <note>Attributed by BM and Surgeon General's catalogues to John Pechey (under which heading they include the works of John Pechey, 1655-1716, and also those of John Peachie, the extra licentiate). This pamphlet is not included among the works of Pechey listed in DNB. It is attributed by Halkett and Laing, 1926, to "John Peachie or Pechey, M.D." (presumably the extra-licentiate). This attribution is probably wrong, since John Peachie was not admitted an extra-licentiate of the College of Physicians until 1683.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Remember that the Reverend Dr. <hi>Spratt,</hi> the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> in his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Hiſtory of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> tells us, that we are extreamly beholding unto my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> for his Communicating to the World the Remedies which were Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55853:3"/>
found advantageous in the Cure of the <hi>Sweating Sickneſs,</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; and therefore I hope I may deſerve thanks for informing my Countrey-men what I have after long Experience found uſeful in the Cure of the Scurvy, which now proves as troubleſome to <hi>England</hi> as that Diſeaſe did then, though not ſo mortal.</p>
            <p>And the Remedy is the <hi>Virginean Nutts,</hi> or rather <hi>Kernels,</hi> which grow upon the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus-Tree,</hi> deſcribed by Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> and by <hi>Lygon,</hi> and ſeveral other Authors: But none have made thoſe particular Experiments I have done upon the uſe of the Nutts, and I find them to anſwer the ſame Intentions that the <hi>Gum Animi</hi> doth, which flows from the ſame Tree. It mightily opens Obſtructions of the Liver, and Refines the whole Maſs of Blood, and mends a Scorbutick ill habit of Body, by impregnating that Vital Liquor with ſuch volatile Salts, as reſtore it when flat and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, to a more pure and ſpirituous State, and thereby preſerves it from Fixation, and clears the Skin from Spots and all Impurities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55853:3"/>
I knew a Gentlewoman who was highly Scorbutical, and much afflicted with various Fermentations in her Blood, which cauſed the Eruption of ſtrange Pimples and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Blemiſhes in her Face and Hands, with great Faintings, Wearineſs and Indiſpoſition to Motion, and wandering Pains in her Limbs, her Teeth looſe, and Gums ſore; her Body cover'd with Scurf like a Leproſie; and yet by the uſe of this Medicine mixed with all her Drink and Spoon-meat, in one Months time ſhe was perfectly recovered.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Grant</hi> obſerves, that this Diſeaſe of the Scurvy doth wonderfully encreaſe every year in our Bills of Mortality, and thereupon wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſome effectual Remedies might be found out by Phyſicians, and I am well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that this is one.</p>
            <p>I could tell you of a Man about Fifty years of Age, who by living in a Groſs Air, and uſing an ill Dyet, and wanting Exerciſe, had his whole Maſs of Blood ſo corrupted, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55853:4"/>
the Spirits ſo evaporated, that they became dead and flat, like decayed Drinks, and Eager and ſharp like Vinegar: And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by the uſe of a Tincture, Spirit and Extract drawn out of theſe Nutts, he became ſtrong, lively and chearful, and was fit for all Employments both of Body and Mind.</p>
            <p>An old Gentlewoman, who by a long fit of Sickneſs was brought into the Scurvy, the fine parts of her Blood were run into a fluid Salt, and ſhe found a univerſal Languor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Spirits, which made her Life uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; ſhe uſed many Medicines, and had much Advice, and at length a Friend told her of theſe Drops, which any one may make if they pleaſe to procure the Nuts, for the Medicins are drawn out only with ſmall Wines. Theſe Medicines perfectly recover'd her to a ſtate of Health, and good Habit of Body.</p>
            <p>A middle-aged Perſon who was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Scurvy, and had many blew Spots in his Skin, great Wearineſs and Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55853:4"/>
upon his Spirits, with wandering Pains in divers parts of his Body, very bad decayed Teeth, and little or no Appetite to Food, with ſowre Belchings and offenſive Fumes ariſing up to his Noſtrils, and ſeveral other ſcorbutical Symptoms; he had taken great Quantities of Spirits of Scurvy-graſs, and ſtill found himſelf grow worſe and worſe; at length I gave him the Drops drawn out of theſe Nuts, about twelve at a time, the Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Morning, the White at Noon, and the Black at Night: They may be given in Purging Waters, or in Mum, or in any agreeable Spoon-meat.</p>
            <p>I could give many more Examples, of Cures wrought by them, but 'twill be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
