            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Thou makest a hideous noyse and great racket about a Letter written to his grace, but intercepted; Whereas it was no Letter in truth and proprietie of speech, but a note unsealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any indorsment or date, and that note also drawne from the Doctor by a wile, by one who at this present is Suttler to the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Band at S. <hi>Albans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50301:9"/>Thirdly, thou sayest, the Doctor informed his grace what good service he had done the King this Parliament; whereas there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a word in that Letter or Note of any service done to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, but a meere complaint of unsufferable wrongs offered the Doctor by the Parliament Souldiers, who plundered him both at <hi>Acton</hi> and <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, thou impudently affirmest, that he desired his grace to move the King to conferre upon him the Deanerie of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>; whereas the words in the originall Letter not falsified are, that his grace would put in for himselfe, that he might hold it as a <hi>Commendam</hi> with the Administratorship of <hi>Carlile,</hi> as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Yorke</hi> held it before.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, thou sayest, that the Doctor wrote all this pretended Letter with his owne hand, whereas he wrote never a Line of it with his owne hand, but dictated to another.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, thou blushest not to say, that the Doctor acknowledged the Letter examined before the Committee to be his owne, whereas that was but a false transcript, and never so much as shewed to the Doctor, much lesse acknowledged by him to be true. Thou wilt say then, if neither the originall now at <hi>Oxford,</hi> nor the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script was exhibited to the Doctor, nor any witnesse at all produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make faith, either that the originall being unsealed was not corrupted, or that this transcript perfectly accorded with the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, neither could be any evidence against the Doctor; how then came it to passe that he was blowne out of the Assembly, and both his Livings, by one blast of <hi>Euroclydon?</hi> I could answer as <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> did to the Emperour, who demanded of him what he thought of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> a man so much cryed <hi>up and downe</hi> in the world; <hi>up</hi> among the reformed, but <hi>downe</hi> in the Popish Church: Truely, quoth <hi>Erasmus,</hi> he is a worthy and able Divine, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise irreproveable, onely he was too blame in two things.</p>
               <p>First, That he touched the Popes triple Crowne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Monkes belly, which were two <hi>Noli me tangere's:</hi> so the Doctor, though otherwise he went with a right foot, and kept pace with those of his ranke, yet in two things he tript.</p>
               <p>First, In the great debate about the three Creeds, he sided with the Presbyterians against the Independents.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When the new Covenant was first offered to the Assembly, he openly and professedly opposed it, and endeavoured to prove, that all the Divines that were wrapt in that new bond,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50301:9"/>
were intangled in perjurie by breaking their Oathes of canonicall obedience. For this, the Independents accounted him a <hi>Malignant,</hi> and the Presbyterians <hi>confided</hi> not in him. Besides, our Polititians that have beene brought up at the feet of the great <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> taking upon them the defence of <hi>Ostracisme</hi> (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more practised then now, even by those who understand not what the word signifies) teach us, that though a man have a <hi>cleare brest</hi> and strong voyce, yet if it be not tunable, or his Note be so loud, that hee drowneth the rest in the Consort, it is fit he should be put out of the Quire. And truely, <hi>Britanicus,</hi> that needed not, for though he were Voted into it by 390 voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet he never voted himselfe into it, but often wished him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe out of it, not because he was averse from Synods, as the learne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Fathers (Sir-named the Divine) was, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in his time, that he never saw good end of any such Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; but because this Assembly was not called by the sound of <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>Silver trumpet,</hi> neither were the <hi>Members</hi> thereof elected or nominated by the <hi>bodie</hi> of the Clergie, neither have they any decisive, but onely consultive, and deliberative suffrages. In which regard, he conceived that he might doe more hurt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by his presence there, then good to others by his assistance. And therefore when he heard, that like a Candle hee was <hi>blowne in and out</hi> with the same <hi>breath,</hi> hee past not at all for it, deeming himselfe neither a gainer by the one, nor looser by the other.</p>

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50301:11"/>
                  <q>A Letter of Doctor <hi>Featley's</hi> intercepted, going to <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> wherin were contained great imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the proceedings of the Assembly, and diverse Members both of the Assembly and Parliament, whereby it appeares that he is a <hi>Spie</hi> and Intelligencer to <hi>Oxford:</hi> The Letter was read before the Committee, and the Doctor called to his Answer, who confessed all the materiall points in it, &amp;c. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 29. 1643.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This report of the Chaire-man, may be reduced to this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whosoever sends a Letter to the Primate of</hi> Armagh, <hi>containing great imputations upon the Members of the Assembly and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a Spie and Intelligencer to</hi> Oxford, <hi>and ought to be deprived of both his Livings, Bookes, and Libertie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Doctor sent a Letter to the Primate of</hi> Armagh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>he ought to be deprived of his Livings, Bookes, and Libertie</hi>; as it followeth there in the Sentence.</p>
               <p>Here the Conclusion is in <hi>Ferio,</hi> or in <hi>Bocardo</hi> rather. But the premisses are both false,<note place="margin">The name of a Mood in the third Figure, and also of a Prison.</note> and it will cost the Reporter hot water to make good either of them.</p>
               <p>For first, the originall Letter, was never shewed to the Doctor, nor acknowledged by him, nor any witnesse produced, to testifie that it was written by him; and therefore can be no evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him in any Court where <hi>Astrea</hi> sits.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Transcript upon which the Committee proceeded, disagreeth with the originall in diverse materiall points, as is proved elsewhere: Neither was there any Faith at all made before the Doctor, to convince him, that the Letter read before the Committee was a true Transcript.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in that Letter there was no imputation, great or small, layd upon the Members of the Assembly, or Parliament; unlesse it be an imputation to say, That the <hi>Prolocutors</hi> dayly prayer was the best and truest <hi>Diurnall,</hi> for that he had a speciall gift to pray, not so much <hi>ex tempore</hi> as <hi>de tempore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The great <hi>imputations</hi> spoken of, wee desire that the Reporter, for his <hi>reputation</hi> sake, would specifie: For either they were true, or false: If they were true, why are nor the Members of the Assembly and Parliament questioned, and punished for them? if they were false, why was not the Doctor put to his proofe, and in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50301:12"/>
case he failed, censured as a slanderer? <hi>There's a Pad in the Straw; Aliquid latet quod non patet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, To send a Letter from one Member of the Assembly to another, is not to be a Spie or Intelligencer to the adverse partie: But such a one was the Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> not onely a Member of the Assembly, chosen by the joynt Votes of the whole House of Commons, but a Member at that time in such grace with the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, that he was often alledged with great honour and respect both by the Assessors and others, especially in debating the Article of Christs descent into Hell.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, Resolves of a Synod and conclusions <hi>de side,</hi> are no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of State; neither is the imparting of them to a most religious, learned, and every way accomplished Bishop, betraying secrets to an enemie, but consulting an <hi>Oracle</hi> in Theologicall disputes of as great difficultie as moment.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Whereas it is said, that the Doctor confessed all the materiall points in the transcript<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is most untrue: for the main and onely materiall point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning aspersions layd upon Members of the Assembly and Parliament, was never so much as put to the Doctor, much lesse confessed by him; and for the truth hereof, he appealeth to the whole Committee for Examinations.</p>

The first, concerning the eighth Article of Religion; the second, concerning the eleventh; the third, concerning the second clause in the New Covenant. The

first, whether those words in the Article, (<hi>The three Creeds ought throughly to be received and beleeved</hi>) might stand.

The third, whether those words in the New Covenant, <hi>I will endeavour the extirpation of Poperie</hi> and <hi>Prelacie, that is, government by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops, &amp;c,</hi> shall passe without any qualification or additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words <hi>papall</hi> or <hi>tyrannicall</hi> or <hi>independent.</hi> The Assemblie voted affirmatively in all three, the Doctor in the two former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with them, but dissented in the latter: upon what grounds he concurred in the former and dissented in the latter, the ensuing Speeches made in the Assemblie will declare.</p>

                              </gap>rer than day light, that this Creed is falsely father'd upon <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and is adulterated by the adding of a clause inserted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop; and for that which is called the Apostles Creed, the father who so <hi>christened</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Hereunto I answer, that though the entire Creed, which is read in our Churches, under the name of the <hi>Nicen,</hi> be found <hi>totidem verbis</hi> in the <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane</hi>; yet it may be truely called the <hi>Nicen,</hi> because the greatest part of it is taken out of that of <hi>Nice.</hi> And howsoever, some doubt whether <hi>Athanasius</hi> were the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Creed which beares his name, yet the greater number of the learned of latter ages intitle him to it; and though peradventure he framed it not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet it is most agreeable to his doctrine, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be drawn out of his works, and in that regard may be rightly tearmed his Creed. And for the third Creed, although I beleeve not, that either the Apostles joyntly or severally dictated it: yet I subscribe to <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement, who saith, that it was a summarie of the Christian Faith, extant in the Apostles dayes, and approved of by them. Howsoever, according to the rule of <hi>Aristotle, Loquendum cum vulgo, licet sentiendum cum sapientibus,</hi> we must use the language of the vulgar, though we vote with wise men, and think as they doe. And certaine it is, these three Creeds, for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, have generally passed under the titles of the <hi>Nicen,</hi> the <hi>Athanasian,</hi> and the Apostles. So much for the <hi>titles.</hi> Against the Creeds themselves, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions which are taken, either concern the form of propounding the Articles, or the matter and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of them; concerning the manner of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, it is objected to be in too peremptorie a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50301:14"/>
way, <hi>under pain of damnation,</hi> and that they <hi>ought to be thoroughly beleeved.</hi> To the former I answer with <hi>Leo,</hi> where it is said, <hi>Whosoever holds not this Creed, shall perish everlastingly</hi>;<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Vid. Vossium de</hi> 36 <hi>Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi>
                              </note> It is understood of such as have capacity to understand it, and their consciences are convinced of the truth of it. To the latter, that <hi>thoroughly</hi> to beleeve it, signifies no more then <hi>throughout,</hi> and entirely, and that not for the authoritie of the Creeds themselves, but for the Scripture by which they are confirmed. The exceptions against the matter or doctrine of the Creeds, either concern the first Article, <hi>God of God,</hi> or the Article about the <hi>descent into hell.</hi> For the first, there can be no doubt at all of it, for the Sonne is of the Father, and therefore the Father and Sonne being God, it must needs follow, that Christ is God of God, neither will it hence follow, that the Deitie of the Sonne is of the Deity of the Father. For the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument holdeth not <hi>a concreto ad abstractum, verbi gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ,</hi> it will not follow, <hi>Deus passus est, ergo deitas passa est,</hi> God suffered, <hi>ergo</hi> the deity suffered: nor this, <hi>Maria est mater Dei, ergo est mater deitatis</hi>; Mary is the mother of God, <hi>ergo</hi> she is mother of the Deity. Yea but <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, Christ is <hi>autotheos,</hi> God of himselfe; the answer is easie, Christ is God of himselfe, <hi>ratione essentiae</hi>; but God of God, <hi>ratione personae.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is objected, that if he be <hi>Deus de Deo,</hi> it must be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>per productionem essentiae,</hi> or <hi>communicationem</hi>; by the production, or communication of the essence: though <hi>Beza,</hi> and other of our Divines stick not at the latter phrase, yet it followeth not; for it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove him God of God, that his person is generated of the Father, and it is safer to say that hee hath <hi>communem essentiam cum patre,</hi> then <hi>communicatam.</hi> rather common then communicated. For the latter,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50301:15"/>
concerning descent into Hell, all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the world acknowledge, that CHRIST some way descended into hell, either locally, as many of the ancient fathers, <hi>Latimer</hi> the martyr, <hi>Bilson</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and <hi>Noel</hi> in his catechism (commanded to be taught in all Schools, soon after the publishing the 39 Articles expound it) or vertually as <hi>Durand,</hi> or metaphorically as <hi>Calvin,</hi> or metonymically as <hi>Tile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Perkins,</hi> and this Assembly; and therefore no man need to make scruple of subscribing to the Article, as it stands in the creed, seeing it is capable of so many orthodoxall explications, and therein I desire that this Assembly in their aspersions would (after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the harmony of confessions) content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with branding onely the popish exposition of this Article, which taketh hell for <hi>limbus patrum,</hi> or purgatory (Netherland regions, <hi>extra anni solisquevias</hi>) for any of the other foure interpretations, they are so far from being Hereticall, that it hath not bin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that any of them is erroneous.</p>

                           <p>First, we are to take notice of a double obedience of Christ; a generall, which he performed to the whole law through the whole course of his life: a speciall, which he performed to that particular command of his Father, to lay down his life for his sheep.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, when we speak of this generall and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall obedience of Christ (which some tearm active and passive) though it be most true which <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>Christus in vita habuit actionem passivam; in morte passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem activam</hi>: Christ in his life performed a passive action; in his death he sustained an active passion. It is confessed on all hands, that both are necessarie to justification, &amp; that Christ performed both <hi>for us</hi>; but then we must distinguish of this tearm, <hi>for us</hi>; for it may either signifie <hi>bono nostre,</hi> only <hi>for our good</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof, or also <hi>loco nostro,</hi> in <hi>our stead and place</hi>; that Christ satisfied the punishment of the law, and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the precepts thereof for us, that is, for our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50301:19"/>
is not denyed by any: and therefore those texts, <hi>puer natus est nobis, &amp; oportet nos implere omnem justitiam, &amp; factus est sub lege ut eos redimeret</hi>; to us a Child is borne, and so we ought to fulfill all righteousnesse, and he was made under the law, that he might redeem those that were under the law, and the like might be spared; they are like the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> swords, too short to reach their adversaries. But that he fulfilled the law, <hi>loco nostro,</hi> in <hi>our stead and place,</hi> that's denyed by <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Vilenus</hi>; who conceive that the passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience only is imputed to us, <hi>et implet utramque paginam,</hi> not the active. Their principall reasons are.</p>

                              </note>First, Christ as man, being a creature, was bound to fulfill the law of his Creator for himselfe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he had not been <hi>sacerdos inculpatus,</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, the Scripture attributeth our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reconciliation to the blood of Christ; <hi>Christs blood cleanseth us from all sin,</hi> 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 1, 9, and 6. <hi>Christ gave his flesh for the life of the world.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, he that is freed from the guilt of all sins, of omission as well as commission, is to be reputed, as if he had fulfilled the law: for <hi>idem est esse iustum &amp; insontem,</hi> it is all one to be a just and an innocent man. But by the imputation of Christs passive obedience we are freed from the guilt of all sin, as well of omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as commission, <hi>ergo</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, if Christs active obedience be imputed to us, then there needs no remission of sins; for he

who is esteemed to have fulfilled the law, needs no forgivenesse for the breach it.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, those who are freed from eternall death, of necessitie attain everlasting life: but by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christs passive obedience, we are freed from eternall death: <hi>ergo,</hi> by it we obtain everlasting life.</p>
                           <p>To the first, a three-fold answer may be given. First,<note place="margin">

                              </gap>, by way of confirmation, I set to the proof thereof.</p>
                           <p>First, if justification be a distinct thing from redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and satisfaction: then the imputation of Christs meer passive obedience will not suffice for our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: but they are distinct things, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9, 24. <hi>He shall make an end of sin, he shall make reconciliation for iniquitie, and bring in everlasting righteousnesse.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 30. He is made to us, <hi>righteousnesse, and sanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, that which is imputed to us, is called righteousnesse, and <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. but meer passive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience makes not a man righteous, but only pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50301:20"/>
Thirdly, the fulfilling of the ceremoniall law is a different thing from Christs passive obedience; but that is imputed to us, by the reason which our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries bring, because Christ did not that for himself, in regard he had no sin; whereof all those legall acts were a kind of confession: and therefore it must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to us.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, If part of Christs active obedience be imputed to us, why not the whole? But the adversaries confesse, that Christs voluntarie submitting himself to death, and offering up himself for a sacrifice to God (which are parts of his active obedience) are imputed to us: for otherwise his bare sufferings had not been meritorious, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his whole active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is imputed to us.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, unlesse Christs actuall fulfilling of the law be imputed to us, we are debarred of eternall life, which is promised to none but such who in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or by Christ have fulfilled the law, according to those texts, <hi>fac hoc &amp; vives: &amp; si vis ad vitam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredi, serva mandata:</hi> doe this and thou shalt live, and if thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                           <p>If Christ were not bound to fulfill the law for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, upon our adversaries own ground, his fulfilling the law must be imputed to us: but he was not bound to fulfill the law for himself. First, because he was not <hi>persona humana, &amp; lex datur personae, non naturae</hi>; Christ was not a humane person, and the law is given to the person, not to the nature. Secondly, because as Son of man, he is Lord of the Sabbath, and so of the law. Thirdly, because he is the King of the Church, to prescribe lawes to his subjects, not to himself, and all power is given to him both in heaven and earth.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50301:21"/>
Lastly, because no man will say, that Christ in heaven hath any obligation upon him, yet there he hath his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: that nature therefore, as in him it was hypostatically united to the deitie, was free from all tye in regard of himselfe; what he engaged himself was for us, and to be allowed on our accompt.</p>

                           <p>First, the <hi>Antinomians</hi> object, if Christs active righteousnesse be imputed unto us, then are not we bound to keep the law, because Christ hath kept it for us.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="29" facs="tcp:50301:21"/>
This objection may be assoyled with a double an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: first, that this active obedience of Christ is imputed to none but true penitents. For though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be no cause of our justification, yet it is <hi>conditio requisita in subjecto,</hi> a condition required in the subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to beleeve the remission of our sins, by imputation of Christs satisfaction and righteousnesse without a sincere and serious purpose to forsake all our transgressions, and walk in newnesse of life, is an act, not of Faith, but of presumption. Secondly, I grant, that Christs righteousnesse being imputed to us, we are not bound to fulfill the law <hi>hoc nomine</hi> to justify us before God, or procure us a title to the Kingdom of Heaven: but for other ends, namely, to glorifie God, obey his will, to testifie our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to our Redeemer, to shew our faith by our works, to make our election sure to our selves, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn our profession with a holy conversation, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd scandall, and avert Gods judgements.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the <hi>Papists</hi> object, if Christs active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be imputed to us, then either the whole, or a part of it: not a part, for that will make us righteous but in part: not the whole, for then no other should have share in it, but our selves; and everie particular beleever should be as righteous as Christ himself, and everie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e as another.</p>
                           <p>But this objection may be assoyled by a three-fold answer. First, there is a double <hi>totum</hi> or whole, <hi>totum extra quod nihil est, &amp; totum cui nihil deest</hi>: a whole out of which there is nothing; as the whole water is in the basin; and a whole to which nothing is wanting, as the whole soul is in every part of the body; for the soul is <hi>tota</hi> in <hi>toto,</hi> and <hi>tota</hi> in <hi>qualibet parte.</hi> Christs
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50301:22"/>
whole obedience in the first sense is imputed to us, not in the second. 2. All believers, according to the speech of <hi>Luther,</hi> are <hi>aeque justi ratione justitiae imputatae,</hi> equally just in respect of imputed justice, though not <hi>inhaerentis,</hi> of inherent; in respect of passive, not active righteousnesse. Thirdly, <hi>aeque pronunciamur justi, ut Christus</hi>; we are equally pronounced just, as Christ; that is, we are as truely acquitted and absolved as he; <hi>sed non pronunciamur aeque justi,</hi> but not pronounced e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually just: for his justice was inherent, ours imputed; his from himself, ours from him; his of infinite worth, sufficient to justifie all beleevers; ours of finite, and sufficient only for our selves.</p>
                           <p>The Arminians object, if <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> 
                              <hi>credere,</hi> or the very act of believing justifie us, then not Christs imputed righteousnesse. But the very act of believing justifieth, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved, and it was counted to him for righteousnesse. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that saith may be considered either <hi>ratione actus,</hi> or <hi>ratione objecti,</hi> in regard of the act, or of the object. Faith justifieth not <hi>ratione actus,</hi> for then some work should justifie; but <hi>ratione objecti,</hi> not in regard of the act, but in regard of the object; as the spoon feeds the child, in regard of the milk in it; and the chirurgions hand heals, in regard of the playster he applies: those that were healed by looking upon the brazen serpent, were not cured by the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their sight, for the purblind were as well hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as the sharp-sighted, but by a supernaturall vertue at that time given to the object, the brazen serpent, a type of Christ.</p>
                           <p n="4">4.
The <hi>Socinians</hi> object, God doth not justifie man by an act of injustice: but it is injustice to punish one man for another, or attribute one mans righteousnesse
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50301:22"/>
to another: for, <hi>justitiae est suum cuique tribuere,</hi> it is the office or property of justice to give to every man his owne; therefore we are not justified by the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christs active or passive obedience. But this objection may be assoyled with a double answer. First it is not against justice, but agreeable to justice, to lay the debt or penalty of one man upon another, in case that one man voluntarily undertake for the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becomes his surety: as it was just to lay <hi>Cimon</hi> in the gaol for his father <hi>Miltiades</hi> debt, after he ingaged himself for it, and made it his own: neither was it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just to put out one of <hi>Zaleuchus</hi> his eyes for his sons adulterie, after hee undertook to satisfie for his son, and to save him one eye, who otherwise should have lost both. Secondly when God imputes Christs righteousnesse unto us, he gives us our <hi>own,</hi> namely, that which Christ hath purchased for us by his death: and secondly in regard of our union with Christ, whatsoever is Christs in this kind, is ours, and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <p>THe expression agreed upon by the Assemblie,<note place="margin">The fifth speech to the eleventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</note> seemes liable to three exceptions, redundancie, deficiencie, and noveltie: redundancie, in the word <hi>whole</hi>; deficiencie, in the word <hi>obedience</hi>; and novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in the word <hi>imputed</hi>: as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of the serpent, <hi>quot colores tot dolores</hi>; so we may say here, <hi>quot literae tot liturae.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The first exception is of redundancie: for within the accompt of the <hi>whole</hi> obedience of Christ commeth his obedience to the ceremoniall law, which yet is not imputed to us, because we ought no obedience to it; it was no part of our debt, and therefore our sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his laying it down commeth not upon our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.</p>
                           <p>The second exception is of deficiencie in the word <hi>obedience,</hi> for it falls short of that which is imputed to us. For Christs originall righteousnesse is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised under either his active or passive obedience; yet that also must be imputed to us, as <hi>Beza</hi> elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth, putting the case thus: we were accompta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the divine justice for three things, originall corruption, sins of omission, and sins of commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                           <p>To this three-fold maladie a three-fold remedie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50301:25"/>
was to be applyed: to our originall sins, Christs ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall righteousnesse: to sins of omission, Christs active: to sins of commission, his passive obedience. If the accuser of the brethren article against us at Christs bar, thou wert conceived and born in sin: the answer is, but my mediators conception and birth was without sin; if he article, thou hast omitted many duties of the law: the answer is, Christ hath fulfilled the law for me; if he article in the third place, thou hast committed many actuall sins against the law: the answer is, Christ hath satisfied for them by his death and passion.</p>
                           <p>The third exception is of noveltie: for the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christs active and passive obedience was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver defined for <hi>dogma fidei,</hi> a doctrine of faith, till the Synods held at <hi>Gap</hi> and <hi>Privase</hi> in our memorie. But these aspersions may be easily washed away thus.</p>
                           <p>First, though we were not bound to the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law, yet the <hi>Iewes</hi> were: to whom this obedience of Christ was necessarily to be imputed, and this seemeth to be the decision of the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 4. <hi>Made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, to redeem them that were under the law.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, though Christs originall righteousnesse were most requisite in him to qualifie him to be both our high Priest and sacrifice, that he might be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate lamb and an high Priest <hi>separated from sinners</hi>; and though this originall righteousnesse hath influence into our birth, to cleanse it: yet, as <hi>Rivetus</hi> acutely observeth, it was not properly the work of Christ, but of the holy-Ghost sanctifying him in the womb, and in that regard not to be imputed to us as any act of our mediator.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, though in the Synods above named the controversies which arose about this point, first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                              <hi>Piscator</hi> and <hi>Rivet,</hi> and after between <hi>Moulin</hi> and <hi>Tilenus,</hi> were determined; yet the doctrine it self was much more ancient: For besides the testimonies of <hi>Bernard, exhortat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad templ. Chrys.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Aug. in Psal.</hi> 21. and <hi>Iustin Martyr in quaest.</hi> heretofore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by me, <hi>Tilenus</hi> himself confesseth that it was <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion: and <hi>Calvin</hi> is expresse for it, <hi>in ep. ad Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>Cum ad Christum ventum est, in eo invenitur exacta legis justitia quae per imputationem fit nostra</hi>; when we come to Christ, in him we find the exact justice of the law, which by imputation is made ours. And so is <hi>Peter Martyr, in ep. ad Rom. c.</hi> 8. <hi>Iustitia Christi qua lex impleta fuit, illorum jam est justitia, &amp; illis à Deo imputatur:</hi> Christ his righteousnesse, by which the law is fulfilled, is now their righteousnesse, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by God. And <hi>Vrsin. Catech. Perfecta satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio, justitia &amp; sanctitas Christi mihi imputatur:</hi> Christ his perfect satisfaction, justice and holinesse, is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me. And <hi>Hemmingius de justif. art.</hi> 2. <hi>Iustificatio hominis est credentis in Christum absolutio à peccato propter mortem Christi, &amp; imputatio justitiae Christi:</hi> justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the acquitting of a beleever from sinne for the death of Christ, and the imputation of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.

                           <p>But here me thinks I heare those who are most active in the Assembly for the imputation of the meer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive obedience of Christ, like the Tribunes among the <hi>Romans, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

though some of the ancient Fathers, and not a few of the reformed Doctors cast in their <hi>white stone</hi> among ours: yet that we want his suffrage, who alone hath the turning voice in all debates of this kind, and that according to our protestation made at our first meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ought to resolve upon nothing in matter of faith, but what we are perswaded hath firm and sure ground in Scripture: and howsoever some texts have been alledged for the imputation of both active and passive obedience, yet that at our last sitting they were wrested from us, and all inferences from thence cut off, all the re-doubts &amp; forts built upon that holy ground <hi>sleighted</hi>: it will import therefore very much those who stand for the affirmative part to <hi>recruit</hi> the <hi>forces of truth,</hi> and <hi>make up the breaches in our forts</hi> made by the adversaries batteries.</p>
                           <p>First, our first fort is built upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19. after this manner:<note place="margin">

But we are made righteous by the obedience of Christ, as the Apostle affirmeth in the text quoted. Therefore Christs obedience must needs be imputed to us.</p>

                              </note>In this fort they make a breach thus: by obedience the Apostle here understandeth that speciall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which Christ performed to the commandement of his Father, for laying down his life for his sheep; of which the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to death, even to the death of the crosse:</hi> therefore this text maketh nothing for the imputation of Christs active obedience.</p>

                              </note>But First, the breach is thus repaired: the word in the former verse is not <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50301:26"/>
taken in Scripture for suffering, or meer passive obedience.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Apostle saith, <hi>loc. supra. cit. many are made righteous</hi>; and <hi>righteousnesse</hi> came upon all to <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life</hi>; and Christ is the end of the law <hi>for righteousnesse</hi>; and the abundance of grace, and <hi>gift of righteousnesse</hi> shall reign by one Jesus Christ: but no man is said to have justification of life, or abundance of grace, and the gift of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> or to be made <hi>righteous,</hi> by suffering only: for the willing undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of punishment satisfieth the law but in part; it denominateth a man patient, but not absolutely righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Christ himself was not righteous only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his sufferings; and therefore the imputation of them only unto us will not make us formally righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, though it fully acquitteth us from all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the obedience here mentioned is set in opposition to <hi>Adams</hi> disobedience: but <hi>Adams</hi> diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was active: therefore Christs obedience must be active.</p>
                           <p>This argument may be illustrated by S. <hi>Bernards</hi> paraphrase, <hi>ad exhort, ad Templar. c.</hi> 11. <hi>ablato peccato, redit justitia; porro mors Chrsti m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </note> and it is granted on all hands that Christ was made a sacrifice for sin, that we might be accompted righteous before God; and this maketh for the imputation of the passive, but not the active obedience of Christ.<note place="margin">

                           <p>First, there is no necessitie of expounding here sin by this glosse, <hi>a sacrifice for sin</hi>: the words will carrie as well another interpretation, namely, that as Christ was reputed a sinner for us, or in our stead: so we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted righteousnesse in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But our sins are no way in him but by imputation, therefore his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse

                           <p>Secondly, admit we take sin for sacrifice for sin in this place, this very interpretation rather strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth then weakneth the former argument: for that righteousnesse which is said to be in Christ would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ours,<note place="margin">

                              </note> if his death had not been a sacrifice for our sins: thus therefore <hi>I</hi> collect the argument out of this place.</p>
                           <p>The righteousnesse which is in Christ can be no otherwise ours then by imputation; but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse here spoken of is the righteousnesse in Christ; <hi>ergo,</hi> it cannot be ours any other way then by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Christs sufferings are not properly his righteousnesse, though he who suffered were righteous, nay righteousnesse it self: neither are these sufferings now in Christ, but his active obedience and holinesse is truely and properly righteousnesse, and it remains in him; and is that eternall righteousnesse spoken of by the prophet <hi>Daniel, (c.</hi> 9, <hi>v.</hi> 14.) he shall take away sin, and bring everlasting righteousnesse.</p>

part; but, unlesse his active obedience be imputed to us, we have no plea or title at all to eternall life. To illustrate this by a lively similitude, and such an one to which the Apostle himself elsewhere alludes. In the <hi>Olympian</hi> games he that overcame received a crown of gold or silver, or a garland of flowers, or some other prize or badge of honour; but he that was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, besides the losse of the prize, forfeited some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the keeper of the games. Suppose then some friend of his should pay his forfeiture, will that intitle him to his garland?

This is our case by <hi>Adams</hi> transgression and our own: we have incurred a forfeiture, or penaltie; this is satisfied by the imputation of Christs passive obedience: but unlesse his active be also imputed to us, we have no plea or claim at all to our crown of glory; for we have not in our own persons so ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be altogether buried with those that depend upon it, and be left in the grave with the napkin and the linnen cloths wherein the body of Christ was wrapt, especially by them who professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be risen with Christ: that, all impediments being removed, we may all grow unto a perfect man in Christ Jesus: lest perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture by too much wrangling we seem to cut in two the living child, which the tender-hearted mother would not endure; or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the seamlesse coat of Christ, which the cruell souldier would not suffer. This is the substance of what we shall advise: the reason whereof is, because it is a question altogether new, and not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, unheard of in former ages, not determined in any Councell, not handled by the fathers not disputed in the schools. Away with it therefore. Moreover, if both parties now contesting would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stand to the judgements of most learned Divines alleadged by both sides, or would test satisfied in the determinations of the churches urged by both, there needed no other Arbitrator; seeing they themselves, as appears by their writings, agree of their own accord, and have alreadie brought it to an happie issue.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we exhort and friendly advise you that you suffer not these controversies to spread any further: above all, that you keep from the presse, and adde not fuell to this fire by polemicall tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates.</p>

Let them therefore remember that they ought rather to strive to preserve charitie then to gain victorie according to that of the Apostle; endeavouring to keep the unitie of the spirit in the bond of peace; and not to prefer their private glorie before the publique good of the Church.</p>

               <p>With these and other shafts the Doctors quiver was full, though he drew out but one only (considering the time and the auditorie) which he took from the oath at the ordination of the Divines in that Assembly, which, as he conceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tied up their hands fast enough from subscribing to the second Clause in the Covenant: for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so ordained, who swear for the extirpation of Episcopacie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear their Canonicall obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and question the validitie of their Orders given them, upon condition of performing such obedience and submission as that oath enjoyneth.</p>

                  <p>THe greater content and delight I received in the friendship and society of Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> the greater cut it was to me to part with him; for he is such a man, as you shall meet with but few; and whom, when you know throughly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you cannot but love enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely. He is a man of choyce learning, of a nimble and ready wit, of an honest and religious disposition, seasoned with marvelous sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: at whose departure, your English Priests and Jesuits, because they found him a sore adversary, no doubt did greatly rejoyce: for their manner is to hancker about <hi>Paris,</hi> and to lye in wait for English Gentlemen that travail thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may catch them in their nets, and engage them in the Romish quarrell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with these Doctor <hi>Featley</hi> often encountred, and striving with them, carryed away the prize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and confirmed those that were weak in the faith; and gave proof how much it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your Church to have here an able English Minister to make strong opposition against such pestilent wits.

I am now imployed in expounding the <hi>Apocalyps</hi>: but before I doe expose my labours to be examined here of the learned, I mean to communicate them to one or other of the English, who last crost the seas: worthy Sir, you shall doe me a great benefit, if you shall make me partaker of them; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise no other thanks then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what can proceed from my slender abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and the love of the English nation.

               <head>SECT. XVIII. The sum of <hi>D. F.</hi> his apologie, reduced into two unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dilemma's.</head>
               <p>BEfore I put forth the horns of the <hi>Dilemma's,</hi> I will lay down certain <hi>Lemma's,</hi> or assertions of undeniable veritie.</p>
               <p>First, after <hi>D. F.</hi> had delivered his mind concerning the <hi>Scottish</hi> Covenant, (which he thought he might doe safely in a free Assemblie) and many days before he wrote any Letter to the Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> it was spoken openly at <hi>Westminster,</hi> that the Doctor should be voted out of the Assemblie, as <hi>L.M.</hi> and <hi>M. H.</hi> disclosed to <hi>D. F.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that <hi>D. F.</hi> sent not to <hi>A. Warner</hi> to conveigh a Letter of his to the Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> but <hi>A. Warner</hi> was sent to the Doctor, who, by probable and plausible suggestions, drew this Letter unsealed from the Doctor, which he no sooner received, but he shewed the close Committee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that when the Doctor wrote this Letter to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> the Bishop was an elect Member of the Assemblie by the house of Commons, and both he and Doctor <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Doctor <hi>Ward,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Brounerigg,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Oldisworth</hi> and Doctor <hi>Harris,</hi> and others well affected to the Discipline and Liturgie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were daily expected at the Synod, and some of them excused their necessarie absence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a time from the Assemblie, by Letters to the Prolocu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or, whereof one was presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Doctor <hi>Featley</hi> himself, and Doctor <hi>Gouge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that when the Doctor wrote his Letter to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> there was no declaration or ordinance of either of the houses of Parliament, forbidding correspondencie by Letters to <hi>Oxford,</hi> without leave of the houses, or warrant from the Lord Generall; for the Doctors Letter was written about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> 1643. and the ordinance prohibiting any under pain of Sequestration, to hold intelligence with <hi>Oxford,</hi> bears date <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. 1643. a full moneth after; so that the writing of the fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Letter, at that time, was not so much as <hi>malum quia prohibitum</hi>;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50301:51"/>
neither could the Doctor be censured for it as a crime, because, as the Apostle teacheth us, <hi>where there is no law, there is no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, that there was never any thing objected against the Doctor since the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tting of the Parliament, or the Assemblie, save the seven Articles prefer'd against him by the <hi>Brownists,</hi> of which he was cleared, acquitted, and discharged in a full house after a long debate, <hi>Iuly</hi> 13. and his Letter to the Primate of Ireland, which was written before the ordinance of Parliament made it criminall to write any letters to <hi>Oxford</hi> without speciall leave.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Civicus,</hi> call to thee <hi>Britanicus,</hi> and <hi>Scoticus,</hi> and <hi>Coelicus</hi>; together with <hi>Patriark W.</hi> and Independent <hi>N.</hi> and set all your wits upon the renters, to render some colourable answer to these two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble <hi>dilemma's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, either the vote of the house of Commons is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted oracle of truth and justice, and a concludent and definitive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in poynt of law, or not. If it be so, then is <hi>D. F.</hi> cleare from all aspersions cast upon him.

First the</hi> Doctor <hi>excepted against those words</hi> [Wee will endeavour the true Reformed Protestants Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in Doctrine, Discipline, Worship, and Government, according to the Word of God.] These words <hi>(said the Doctor)</hi> imply that the Worship, Discipline, and Government of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is according to the Word of God, which <hi>(said he)</hi> is more then I dare subscribe, much lesse confirme by an Oath. For first, I am not perswaded that any platforme of Government in each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar circumstance is <hi>jure divino. 2.</hi> Admit some were, yet I doubt whether the <hi>Scots</hi> Presbytery be that. <hi>3.</hi> Although somewhat may seeme to be urged out of Scripture for the Scots Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with some shew of probabilitie, yet far from such evidence as may convince a mans conscience, to sweare it is agreeable to Gods Word. <hi>Next the Doctor excepted against that passage</hi> [I shal endeavour the extirpation of Prelacy in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.] I <hi>(saith he)</hi> dare not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
