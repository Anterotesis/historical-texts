            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEhold, (if thou haſt an eye to pierce into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate of things,) look ſtedfaſtly, and thou ſhalt ſee a ſtrange ſight: One who hath been deeply affected <hi>with Wiſdom, true Wiſdom, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Wiſdom, ſpiritual Wiſdom, inward Wiſdom,</hi> and vehemently purſuing it from the womb; being ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by ſome taſtes of it, and certain lively hopes of further attaining and enjoying its ſweetneſs; at length wholly ſtripped of all his <hi>riches</hi> in this kinde, and his deſire after it again (though it remained ſtrong a a good while after the loſs) quite taken from him alſo.</p>
            <p>Never was I perfectly at enmity with any thing but <hi>folly.</hi> It was not ſimply <hi>ſin</hi> that I was at variance with, but the <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> of ſin. I knew well enough that God and the Creature had an hand in the ſame act, even in every act of ſin: I could bear with it in God, becauſe He knew how to do it <hi>wiſely;</hi> but I could not bear with it in the Creature, becauſe it did it ſo <hi>fooliſhly.</hi> That which made God ſo lovely in my eye, was chiefly <hi>His
<pb facs="tcp:117810:3"/>
Wiſdom,</hi> which to me was the <hi>Crown</hi> of His Love, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Goodneſs, and all his other excellencies, which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs poſſeſſed by Wiſdom, and managed by Wiſdom, would, to my eye, have had no luſtre in them, but defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. That which made the Creature ſo unlovely ſtill to me, as it hath always been, was <hi>its folly,</hi> which hath made all the excellencies of the Creature (wherewith it hath at any time been clothed, and whereby it ſhined in the eyes of others) ſo fulſom to me, that my ſpirit hath ſtil turned as much from them, and from it in them, as from its greateſt pollutions.</p>
            <p>But now, I have been ſo toſs'd and tumbled, melted and new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> molded, that I am changed into that which I thought it utterly impoſſible for me ever to be. I am grown at peace, if not in love, <hi>with folly.</hi> I begin to prefer <hi>Folly</hi> at my very Heart above <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> I am half perſwaded, that there is a more ſweet, quiet, and full enjoyment of ones ſelf in a ſtate of <hi>Folly,</hi> then in a ſtate of <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> beſides its being a neerer, readier, and eaſier paſſage to ſomewhat elſe. I confeſs, I am not yet ſo far ſubdued and changed, as to be content to take up a ſtate of Folly to perpetuity, but onely for a ſeaſon to lie down in it, to obtain a little eaſe and reſpite, and to have the viſage and remembrance of that Wiſdom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly blotted out, which did formerly ſo raviſh and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant me.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of <hi>Folly</hi> I finde a new ſtate of things ſpringing up in me, and repreſenting themſelves to my view; which I entertain like a <hi>Fool,</hi> not wiſely enquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what bottom they have, or how they will endure <hi>the tryal of the fire,</hi> but letting them in or out very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, not regarding either what they are, whence they
<pb facs="tcp:117810:3"/>
come, or whither they go. I ſee, I feel, I am a Fool, I know not (nor can know in the ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am) to whom they belong, I know not how I come by them at any time; They are ſtrangely form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in me: Let them look to themſelves if they are afraid of injury, either from me, or from any elſe becauſe of me; Let him look to them to whom they belong, if he ſet any value upon them, or have any eſteem of them. As for me, I have nothing to do with them, but to let them have their courſe in me, and through me, which I am now at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very free unto; nay, indeed in the preſent ſtate wherein I am, I am altogether unable to ſtop them in it. I finde my ſelf powerfully forming into ſomewhat, which, what ere it be, it will be no thank to me, for I did not like it, nay, reſiſted as long as I could; but now I am vanquiſhed, and ſo broken all in peeces, that there is no more ſtrength or wiſdom left in me; I begin to yeeld up my ſelf ſomewhat freely into the Hands of this unknown Potter, to mold me into what he himſelf has a minde. I am weary of, and much weaned from, my own <hi>will and deſires,</hi> even thoſe which were <hi>moſt pure, moſt ſpiritual,</hi> and now I begin to liſp to this hidden Power which I know not, yet feel working in me. <hi>Thy Will,</hi> Thy unknown Will, thy undeſired Will (by any but thy ſelf) <hi>be done.</hi> What ever <hi>thy Will</hi> be concerning any, let it take place in them, and upon them, to the utmoſt. Bend thy felf no longer to pleaſe the deſire of the <hi>Creature</hi> in any thing, but henceforth apply thy ſelf to pleaſe <hi>thy ſelf</hi> in every thing. Let not me nor any elſe be what we would;
<pb facs="tcp:117810:4"/>
but what <hi>thy Will</hi> pleaſeth to have us; and fulfil <hi>thy whole Will and Counſel</hi> upon us, without giving us the leaſt account of it, until thou pleaſeſt. If thou wilt lead us into <hi>Folly, Sin, Death, Hell,</hi> any thing, every thing, do what thou wilt, carry us whither thou wilt. Let <hi>our Will</hi> wholly dye in us, that it may never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd any thing more, nor chuſe any thing more in any kinde, but as <hi>thy Will</hi> chuſeth for us.</p>
            <p>Ye cannot but be offended at this kinde of voyce <hi>O ye wiſe men,</hi> who know groundedly, and from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Light and Wiſdom, how to frame your deſires and requeſts; yet, if ye be able, give liberty to him (who is made a Fool by the forcible break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all theſe Principles in him) to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he hath (though very unwillingly) been made.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to ſay to perſwade or invite thee to caſt thine eye, beſtow any pains on, or give any regard to that which follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What thou mayſt finde here, I hold out but as the words of a Fool, yet I will not give thee leave to judg them ſo: For as I my ſelf (feeling my ſelf to be a Fool) do not, ſo I know thou canſt not judg them. This is a kinde of <hi>Scripture</hi> which thou art not acquainted with, and though thou wouldſt fain be approving or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet thou canſt not, until thou comeſt to know and underſtand it. <hi>This Light, This Darkneſs</hi> (be it what it will) is of a deeper kinde then thine is, (thine muſt be blotted out before this can be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) and thine eye cannot diſcern it. This is of a new ſtamp, of a new nature, of a new edition, and lies open onely to the judgment of the new eye, which
<pb facs="tcp:117810:4"/>
alone can diſcover what it is in its kinde, whether true or falſe, unfeigned or countefeit. The loweſt in this Region can ſee into the higheſt in thine: But the cleareſt eye of the higheſt in thy Region, cannot diſcern the loweſt here.</p>
            <p>Therefore look to thy ſelf; Take heed what thou thinkeſt, or ſayſt, leſt <hi>thy Wiſdom</hi> (which is now exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and can diſtinguiſh and judg things, to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of it ſelf and others) whereby thou ſcorneſt <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>the Fool,</hi> come under the juſt ſentence and condemnation of the Fool. He who made all things, and hath often prepared Folly to bring Wiſdom down, may be about the ſame work again in a way as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, ſtrange, unexpected, yea, impoſſible to the preſent wiſe man, as thoſe ways he formerly pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſtill were to the wiſeſt in thoſe Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>This is an angry Age, and men can hardly bear any thing, though they are throughly croſſed in it, for the leſs they can bear, the more is layd upon them: yet methinks <hi>the wiſe man</hi> ſhould be able to bear. <hi>He can gladly ſuffer a fool, who knows himſelf to be wiſe.</hi> And yet who is more offended then <hi>the wiſe man?</hi> None is leſs careful of offending then <hi>the fool,</hi> and None more capable of offence then the wiſe man. So far as I have any tincture of what I formerly was, left upon me, I am very loth to offend: But as I am a Fool, I am no whit ſhy of it, but can delight to lay ſnares and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, and to ſee Wiſdom entangled in them, and breaking its ſhins upon them. Therefore have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to me, but uſe thine own freedom in thinking, ſpeaking, judging: It is onely in regard to thy ſelf that I
<pb facs="tcp:117810:5"/>
ſhould adviſe thee to be ſober and ſilent concerning that which thou canſt not yet reach; which counſel, if thou canſt receive, it may be for thine eaſe and advantage, which, when thou comeſt to feel what belongs to true torment and loſs, thou wilt then know how to prize. And when thou findeſt what changes they will make in thee, which all the ſtrength of thy <hi>Reaſon and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſhall not be able to withſtand, (nay, they will break both Reaſon and Religion at their pleaſure; and the more they oppoſe them, the faſter wil they break them;) I ſay, when thou findeſt this by evident ſenſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence paſt all denial or gainſaying, that enmity, rage, or zeal, which is now in thee ſo hot againſt others, will quickly abate; and thou wilt grow ſilent concerning them, if not friends with them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> How thick hath Miſery enwrapped it ſelf about the bulk of this Creation! Where is that eye that can ſee through it into Happineſs? That Happineſs which moſt have dreamed of, is already to many ſwallowed up in Miſery: But where is that Happineſs, which can ſwallow up this unexpected inundation of Miſery, which drowns
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117810:6"/>
both Heaven and Earth? There are waters above, as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, (though it is hard to conceive ſo) and when both meet, they make a dreadful deluge. O how is Truth drowned, Light drowned, Life drowned, Purity drowned, in the great Abyſs of Confuſion! Where is that that remains certain, after this ſharp vehement ſhaking? They perhaps may boast, who have not yet felt the violence of the wind; But it would ſomewhat interrupt their exultation, if they could but conſider, that <hi>their Day is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> yea, it might wholly quaſh it, if they knew how near it were upon them.</p>
            <p>O what a brutiſh thing is man, that can never beleeve or be made ſenſible of any thing, until he come to feel it! Though houſes round about him be on fire, and he have that within which kindles the flame, yet he makes no queſtion but he ſhall live ſecure. From the day that Man has been upon the face of the Earth, ſtill has he been bleſſing himſelf, and pleaſing himſelf with his own condition, magnifying it beyond others (whom he is very wiſe in accuſing and condemning,) in the mean while not truly knowing, either whence he came, what he is, or whither he goes. O fooliſh juſtifier of thy ſelf, O fooliſh condemner of others, being ignorant both of thy ſelf, and others! Thine eye is dark. The light whereby thou ſeeſt is darkneſs; What meaneſt thou to be ſo forward &amp; confident in judging either thy ſelf or others? O God, put out this eye of Man, put out this light of Man, cover it with an Eternal Night. Bring forth a true, a ſubſtantial ſtate of things, with an Eye that may behold it, an Heart that may comprehend it, a Life that may quicken and live in it.</p>
            <p>Awake, awake O Sons of men, How long will ye love vanity? How long will ye ſeek after lyes? How long will ye love ſhadows, and pleaſe your ſelves with them, as if they were the Subſtance? Your condemnation is written on your foreheads, and in the palms of your hands: Ye accuſe, condemn, proſecute, for calling Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Light, Error Truth; and yet which of you doth otherwiſe? Come forth O God, and triumph in the condemnation of all: Throw down the Great Juſtifier, and lay him flat with the loweſt that he has condemned. O that my ſpirit might be once ſatisfied, in beholding that thrown down which it abhors, and that exalted which it loves. And this is that which my Soul in its inmost part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117810:6"/>
That the Tincture both of good and evil, in all its varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and expatiations, might be blotted out; and things reduced into, and produced in their Originality, which comprehends both good and evil in an abſolute perfection. And then we ſhall ſee all things, no more with one kinde of eye appearing to be evil, nor with another kinde of eye appearing to be good, but as they are indeed in their inmoſt bottom, where alone is true Knowledg, Peace, Reſt, and Content, eternally to be found and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, <hi>Reader,</hi> Thou mayſt expect an account of this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe, which I muſt profeſs to thee I am driven to by a kinde of inward impulſion, which I know not of what Nature it is: And I am made ſo weak by continual different exerciſes upon my ſpirit (which I finde powerfully deſtroying and blotting out in me, what ever I have been, or have deſired to be, and molding and forming me to ſomewhat elſe, which I neither expected, nor deſired; hereby I ſay I am brought to ſo much weakneſs) that I am become altogether unable to reſiſt it, otherwiſe it is likely at this time I ſhould not have troubled thee.</p>
            <p>One word more. There was a Paſſage in that Book last ſet forth, which I hear hath adminiſtred offence to divers. The Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was about <hi>Pure Sporting with Sin,</hi> which they think cannot be. I will not ſay that I ſpake that upon a deeper ground then Man uſually ſpeaks upon; yet this I cannot but ſay, It is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and I muſt ſtickle for it, though not with men, yet in mine own ſpirit. Some queſtioned with me, whether I meant the act of Sin? I confeſs my eye, or thoughts, was little upon the act, but upon the inward Nature of it, which muſt not remain in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enmity, but at last be owned as an excellent Servant to him, by whom and for whom all things were made, out of whom they came, and into whom they return, according to his own Will and Guidance. And Sin could never have done him that ſervice that it has, if it had not had that Nature that it has. And Sin muſt have its due from the Righteous Judg, who will as well be glorified in being juſt unto Sin, as in ſhewing his Wiſdom and Power in conquering of it.</p>
            <p>In a word; To the Creature, in the preſent ſtate of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under the preſent Law of the Creature, according to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117810:7"/>
Judgment of the eye of the Creature, every thing is unlovely; and he that ſees them not to be ſo, falls ſhort of the perfection of the creaturely eye. But come deeper, beyond this ſtate, beneath this Law; Look with a true eye, and there you ſhall finde all this unlovelineſs paſs away, and an excellency appear, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could never ſo much as imagine or dream of. And now come back with this eye into the preſent ſtate of all things, and behold them through the true glaſs, and you ſhall ſee them all new here alſo, and very far differing from what you did or could take them to be in your creaturely apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>If this may tend to afford ſatisfaction to any concerning the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of my minde in this respect, it will be pleaſing to me, who delight not to have it hid, but would fain have it opened and preſented to the view of all, not as deſiring either their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or condemnation, but to ſatisfie the deſire it ſelf. This is all I have to expreſs by way of Preface.</p>

            <head>A SERMON TO All Sorts of People, FROM <hi>JOB 9. 22. This is uniform, thereupon I ſpeak: He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>JOb</hi> was a very excellent ſpirited man, and very exact in his practice; ſo exact under that preſent Adminiſtration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was ſet, that his life, temper and motions were exceeding pleaſing to him, who had ſo formed and acted him; in ſo much as he was not aſhamed to boaſt of him, even to the face of the great Oppoſer, Diſturber, and Deſtroyer of ſuch kinde of buildings.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Job</hi> as he was perfect under that Adminiſtration, ſo he was in a proportionable manner bleſſed with Children, Sheep, Camels, Oxen, Aſſes, and a very great Family.</p>
            <p>In a moment all theſe bleſſings are ſnatched away, rich <hi>Job</hi> made poor, by being ſtripped of all; which he takes very patiently, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117810:8"/>
as ſweet a temper of ſpirit under his affliction and miſery, as had attended him in the time of his proſperity.</p>
            <p>After this, (as if there had been a deſign to wear him out) his whole body is ſmitten with diſeaſe and pain, and his mind wounded to purpoſe too: and yet at firſt he takes this kindly alſo, his ſpirit not at all deviating out of that path of perfection, wherein hitherto he had walked.</p>
            <p>But at length, anguiſh overcoming him, it opens the very depths, and cauſes that to come forth which had long layn hid in him, if not alſo from him.</p>
            <p>Certain friends of his (in this ſtate of his) come to viſit him, ſit ſilent by him as aſtoniſhed at him, not knowing what to think of him, nor what to ſay to him: But at length fooliſhly and weakly take occaſion, from ſome diſtemper in his words, to nouriſh in themſelves groundleſs jealouſies concerning him, and with all the ſtrength of arguments they can lay hold on, to impoſe them upon his belief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jobs</hi> ſtate they know not, neither in the nature of things, nor in their own experience; yet a great mind they have to ſay ſomewhat to him, with an intent to help and relieve him; but for want of a true bottom of light, they fall to imagining and gheſſing, and feeding theſe their imaginations with reaſonings that flow in upon them, and take it very ill, that theſe dark conceptions of theirs cannot overbear that more illuminated principle that was in <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They take it for granted, That ſin muſt be the cauſe, or God would never have dealt ſo with <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They urge this from the Juſtice of God, from the experience of all ages: and therefore wiſh <hi>Job</hi> to look to himſelf, to acknowledg his ſin, and humble himſelf before God, and not to fly out into ſuch extravagant ſelf-juſtifications or accuſations of God, as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtemper might diſpoſe him to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> here endeavors to take them off from theſe excurſions, and draws the point between him and them to an head. He denies the bottom whereupon they go, and lays down his own bottom. <hi>This is uniform,</hi> This is every way true. That which ye ſpeak is true; It is true, <hi>That Sinners are met with, Oppreſſors muſt have a time to be themſelves oppreſſed, Hypocrites ſhall not always flouriſh,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117810:8"/>
The Righteous ſhall be bleſſed, &amp;c.</hi> But this will not hold ſo far as ye extend it, that every one that is thus dealt with muſt needs be ſuch an one. But that which I lay down is <hi>uniform,</hi> has no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, is a deeper, a fuller Truth, <hi>Perfect and wicked he deſtroyeth.</hi> How exact ſoever a man be under his adminiſtration, yet it is in the power of him, who made him and formed him into what he is in that adminiſtration, to bring him to deſtruction in it at his pleaſure. He that bringeth both <hi>the perfect and the wicked</hi> upon the ſtage, may turn either of them off from the ſtage, when he will. There is no more to hinder him from deſtroying the perfect, then there is to hinder him from deſtroying the wicked. They are both equally his, They are both at his diſpoſe, They are one and the ſame under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Repreſentations, and he has appointed them both to one and the ſame end, which is deſtruction. This is it I will ſtand to, overthrow it if ye can, <hi>He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perfect and wicked.</hi> Perfect are ſuch as are upright under that adminiſtration under which they are ſet, who in their ſtate and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuit with the Law of it. God has a Law for every thing he brings forth in this ſtate of weakneſs: He that ſuits with the Law of his adminiſtration (that adminiſtration which he is ſet under) is perfect; He who deviates wholy from it, is wicked. <hi>Adam</hi> had his Law of forbearing the <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> The Jews theirs of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, keeping the Paſſover, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſtians theirs likewiſe, of <hi>Faith, Love, Spiritual Obedience, Spiritual Worſhip, a ſweet, meek, humble, heavenly Converſation, &amp;c.</hi> Now ſo far as each of theſe did anſwer their peculiar Law, they came towards that perfection, towards that righteouſneſs, which they were appointed to, and which was to be meaſured thereby: So far as they devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, they came towards and into a ſtate of ſin and wickedneſs; both which are not abſolute, but only under and by the force of the Law of the preſent adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He destroyeth.</hi> Deſtruction is putting an end to the ſtate. When the life and being of a perſon is put out, he is deſtroyed. When the plagues of God light on his outward man unto the death of the body, his body is deſtroyed: When the plagues of God light on his inner man, and put out the life of his Spirit, his inner man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. We think, in every diſpenſation, 'tis only the weak, the imperfect, the wicked, that wrath muſt light upon, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117810:9"/>
the perfect, they ſhall eſcape, they ſhall meet with bleſſedneſs: But <hi>Job</hi> tells you, that they muſt be conſumed too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. God hath ſtored up deſtruction both for the perfect and the wicked, and they ſhall both be ſure to meet with it. God when he pleaſeth falls either upon the wicked or the perfect even to deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is uniform</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job.</hi>) What ground ſoever ye ſpeak on, I am certain of this. I dare lay this as a bottom to build upon, <hi>He deſtroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our God is a conſuming fire,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle.) It may be uſed as an Argument to draw men on to heighten holineſs in their diſpenſation: and yet after it is heightened, the ſame Spirit may ſpeak to them in the very ſame dialect, and tell them yet further, that they muſt be conſumed by this fire for all that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. from Gods <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> He is Lord of all, He has the diſpoſe of all, and his Soveraignty delights to ſhew it ſelf. All the Excellencies of God have their ſeaſons of putting themſelves forth to the utmoſt, <hi>His Wiſdom, Mercy, Power, Love, &amp;c.</hi> So has his <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> Now nothing doth ſo much diſcover his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as his falling upon <hi>the righteous,</hi> upon <hi>the perfect.</hi> Ye think to ſecure your ſelves by his Faithfulneſs, his Word, his Promiſes, to which he muſt be faithful: and will ye not have him faithful to his Soveraignty? He is Lord of all, and has the diſpoſe of all, and let him make never ſo many deeds of gift, he cannot give away any thing from himſelf; but ſtill he has <hi>the Power of Life and Death</hi> in his own hands, and may let it out as he pleaſeth. And this doth wonderfully ſet forth his Soveraignty, his exerciſing it upon the perfect, that when he has tied it up, as faſt as may be, by never ſo many Promiſes, yet it ſhould ſtill have its ſcope, and be able to deal with whom it will, as it will. By this means he that is Lord indeed, truly Lord, originally Lord, vindicates and manifeſts his Lordſhip, when he can ſubject that unto his Will which ſeems moſt exempted from it, as well as that which lies moſt open to him in the way of cleareſt and moſt acknowledged Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe all Diſpenſations are but for a ſeaſon, They are not everlaſting; Therefore Eternity delights to ſwallow them up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Perfect and wicked</hi> are both of the ſame lump, only differently clothed to act their ſeveral parts, which when they have done, their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117810:9"/>
cloathes muſt be taken off, and they turned back into the lump again. There is nothing durable but <hi>the eternal ſtate of things.</hi> Now therefore hath God treaſured up deſtructions for all diſpenſations, becauſe it is ſutable to all diſpenſations. It is as fit for the King to be ſtripped of his gorgious apparel when the Play is done, as the Begar of his rags. This is but a momentany Righteouſneſs or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, a momentany wickedneſs or imperfection, according to the Law of the preſent diſpenſation: and the Righteouſneſs, the wickedneſs, the Law of the Diſpenſation, the Diſpenſation it ſelf, all muſt paſs into the duſt again: When they have lived out their tranſitory life, and acted their ſeveral parts, they muſt return to death.</p>
            <p>So that though there be Righteouſneſs, and Wickedneſs; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Perſons, and Wicked Perſons; Bleſſings to the one, Woes to the other: Yet all this is but under the Diſpenſation, for the ſeaſon of the Diſpenſation, which when it comes to an end, all this paſſes away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Againſt this it will be eaſily and readily objected, That this will deſtroy all Religion towards God, and Righteouſneſs amongſt men. What need any man care, what he thinks or does? How can any man deſire to be Righteous, to be Perfect, if his end muſt be the ſame with him who is moſt imperfect and wicked?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, It will not, it cannot, if rightly underſtood. It will not deſtroy any <hi>true Religion</hi> in any way of adminiſtration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; but only that Corrupt Enmity, Corrupt Hope, Corrupt Deſire, Corrupt Selfiſh-intereſt, which every Adminiſtration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines very much to breed and nouriſh, but <hi>Perfect Love</hi> cannot ſuffer always to ſtand: which if it were once eaten out, every Adminiſtration would be ſweet and pleaſant. If we knew our ſelves, and one another, our own parts, and the parts that others are to act, we ſhould with more reſt and ſatisfaction act ours our ſelves, and with more peace and pleaſure behold others acting theirs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, The Righteous have a double advantage: One in their preſent life, Another in their enſuing death.</p>
            <p>In their preſent life, they both enjoy themſelves and their God, in ſuch a way as the wicked cannot, nor are in any wiſe capable of,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117810:10"/>
in their ſtate and practiſe of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>And in their enſuing death they have another advantage, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more immediate ſtep to ſomewhat further then the death of the wicked can be, (I ſpeak not of the ſhadow of death, but of that which is death indeed, the dying of the Spirit in and to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate.)</p>
            <p>Therefore there is no ground, why the Righteous ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in purſuing Righteouſneſs, nor why the wicked ſhould pleaſe himſelf in abounding in wickedneſs, though ground ſufficient for both to be weary of either, and to long after ſomewhat more perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Not for any to magnifie themſelves much above others, nor to promiſe to themſelves any ſuch great bleſſedneſs beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or to look upon others as objects of ſuch great Miſery, becauſe of ſome appearing-difference between them and others. Indeed there is a difference at preſent in this Diſpenſation, but it is no thank to them that 'tis ſo. Nor are the wicked ſo much to be blamed as they think: (They have their parts to act, and they are fitted to their parts.) This Diſpenſation will have its end, and then you will find no ſuch great difference between you and them, as you thought there was. Deſtruction will make an end of their wickedneſs, yea and it will make an end of your Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo, and then ye will become both one lump of Clay, without either Good or Evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Not to grieve over-much when you find Deſtruction ſeizing upon you. If your body or ſpirit moulder away, If God conſume your Righteouſneſs, your Holineſs, your Perfection, by the blaſt of his Spirit; Grieve not beyond meaſure at it: Alas it muſt dye, This muſt not laſt for ever. You thought to have been made happy by this, your happineſs lies in being delivered from it. This is not <hi>the true treaſure,</hi> or at leaſt not in its true and laſting ſhape, and therefore muſt undergo death and deſtruction in this its preſent appearance.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> raiſes it higher, bids you rejoyce in it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 10. and he gives a ſtrong Reaſon, Verſ. 11. <hi>For the Sun is no ſooner riſen with a burning heat, but it withereth the graſs; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the faſhion of it periſheth: So alſo ſhall the rich man fade away in his ways.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:117810:10"/>
Therefore be glad at the death of that that muſt dye: ye have undergone that ſorrow which there was no avoyding; This is great matter of Joy. The pain of having the ſap and moiſture of your ſpirits dryed up by the ſcorching heat of the Sun, if it be in any degree paſt, 'tis great matter of Joy. Better is the Day of this Death, then the Day of this Life. There is greater matter of Joy in parting with, in putting off this Excellency, then in putting it on.</p>
            <p>Now for a concluſion to all this, I intend to lay down the brief ſum of the whole matter, even of the whole courſe of man under every Adminiſtration, wherein he is either lifted up or thrown down, or both lifted up and thrown down, (firſt lifted up, and then thrown down,) and through which he paſſes to his laſting ſtate. Take it thus.</p>
            <p>We were all made by him who is <hi>the great Potter</hi> or <hi>Former</hi> of all things, (what e're we are, whether righteous or wicked, under what Adminiſtration ſoever:) And this, not ſo much for any ends we can conceave or drive at, as for his own pleaſure; which will have its courſe upon us, and will toſs and tumble us up and down into ſeveral ſorts of Deaths and Lifes, as great and as often as it pleaſeth; till it hath quite confounded and brought us to a perfect loſs in all our own Hopes, Deſires, and Apprehenſions, yea till at laſt it hath quite ſwallowed us up in it ſelf: where when we are dead, buried, and ceaſe to be, know, or deſire any more; that Life may at length ſpring up in us, which till then we are uncapable of any diſtinct deſiring or poſſeſſing. And the paſſage to this, though it be very dreadful to <hi>the fleſh,</hi> being even through <hi>the Gates of Hell, Death, and Destruction;</hi> yet it is in no ſmall meaſure joyful to the eye of that Spirit which diſcerns it to be but a paſſage, and a neceſſary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage too. And what brave Royal Heart would refuſe to joyn iſſue with this requeſt? O let all ſhadowy Perfections, all Perfections that come in and by Adminiſtrations, dye and paſs away, be ſwallowed up by a Death, by a Deſtruction, more powerful then themſelves; that ſo way may be made for the diſcovery of true and compleat Perfection, that it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117810:11"/>
may come forth to ſwallow up, both deſtruction, and all that it hath deſtroyed, for ever; and to bring forth it ſelf and every thing again in its Primitive Glory, that they may return to that beauty wherein they were, before they were ſtained by that Vanity, Miſery and Vexation, whereunto all things are at preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>

               <salute>Dear Anne,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have ſeen your recantation in a Letter of yours, which doth wonderfully pleaſe me. I like well to ſee the creature with its waxed wings mounting up towards <hi>Heaven,</hi> and ſoaring aloft beyond the reach of the ſight of its fellow creatures: But I like it much better to ſee the wax melted by the heat of the Sun, and the poor fooliſh forward creature tumbling down into <hi>the Sea,</hi> or unto <hi>the Earth</hi> again. What ſhould the creature do in Heaven? <hi>The light of God</hi> ſhould not quit it ſelf like it ſelf, if it did not at leaſt dazle, if not wholly extinguiſh the fleſhly eye, and turn it back into its fleſhly principle again. <hi>So let all thine enemies pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, O Lord,</hi> So let all the principles the creature either ſucks in from others, or beats out it ſelf by its own pureſt ſearchings and reaſonings, come to nought, be ſo throughly and effectually thrown down, that the quite contrary may eaſily be reared up in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>But where are you now, <hi>Sweet Anne?</hi> You ſee the rottenneſs of your former foundation, are you ſure you now build upon firm ground, upon <hi>the inmoſt Rock?</hi> You have ſeen <hi>a Light,</hi> which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117810:12"/>
clearly ſhakes <hi>that great Light</hi> which did ſo tranſport you while it appeared <hi>Light,</hi> but are you ſure this Light is ſo clear, ſo deep, of ſo inward perfect a Nature, as it ſhall never be ſhaken? What pretty ſport doth <hi>Original Wiſdom</hi> make with us! He toſſes &amp; tumbles us, makes us be or not be, own or not own, what and when he pleaſes; and well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may. While he hides from us the true and <hi>original colour</hi> of things, and <hi>that skill</hi> whereby he colours things, he may coſen us as often as he pleaſes; He may put what colour he will upon things, and what eye he will into us. And we in beholding the preſent colour with the preſent eye, may be confident in what we ſee, yea in both judging it, and other things by it, not knowing either the root of it, or of that eye that judges it, nor conſidering what changes both the colour and the eye may undergo.</p>
            <p>Let me run over your Letter a little.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I who am unworthy of the eſteem of a Servant,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you know your ſelf, that you call your ſelf unworthy? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear, that the creature ſhould either exalt or throw down it ſelf, for I am ſure it does it not from <hi>true knowledg,</hi> but from <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</hi> Though by the light in them at preſent it is knowledg, and <hi>true knowledg,</hi> unto that eye that is in them; yet to me (or, if you will, to ſomewhat in me, which ſearches, judges and condemns both that eye, and that light) it is but <hi>imagination.</hi> Yet again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding how the creature acts, I can bear with either or both, both the creatures lifting it ſelf up, and throwing it ſelf down, according to the different <hi>eye, ſtate and principle</hi> which it has, and wherein it is and acts. So that though in one ſence I am an utter enemy to all <hi>perſons, principles, things and actions,</hi> yet in another ſence I am perfectly reconciled to them all. I like none of them as ſuch as they take themſelves to be, but I like them all as they are, and as I know them to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do make bold to declare unto you, what the Lord, through his great Love, hath done for me,</hi>

            <p>You ſpeak here of <hi>the Lord, of his Love, his great Love,</hi> of the <hi>working of this Love,</hi> and what it hath wrought for you. Do you know <hi>the Lord, or his Love?</hi> What if I ſhould tell you, that both the Lord and his Love, with all the workings of it, both upon you and others, ſhall paſs away, and never again be acknowledged, or known, as now they are, by yours, or any others, creaturely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117810:12"/>
What would you ſay to me? You might be drawn forth to judg me wonderful deeply and clearly by your preſent eye, but can you or any elſe throughly reſolve this? I tell you truly, when I can ſpeak I will not be ſilent, for fear of mans judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And I will venture to add thus much in the mean time. <hi>My God</hi> would not pleaſe me, if any creature could meaſure the leaſt part of him with that eye which they call ſpiritual; Their heart muſt not know the leaſt ſpark of his <hi>Nature,</hi> nor their tongue be able to utter the leaſt tittle of his <hi>Name.</hi> They may have, and ſhall have, while the time laſts, a knowledg ſuitable to them, but not the leaſt tittle of the true knowledg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the diſcovering me the error of my principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do, condemn it, it muſt come under condemnation, ſo muſt the light that judges it. All principles have their courſe of ſpringing up, growing, living flouriſhing, and at length of returning into death, into condemnation. That preſent principle, that preſent light, which lives now in the death, in the condemnation of this, ſhall feed another with its death.</p>
            <p>I made account to have gone on through your whole Letter, but I find my fleſh weary, and my ſpirit likewiſe ſhutting up. I ſhall therefore only glance at two or three things more, and ſo cloſe.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>that God is not all things.</hi> You ſpeak as true as thoſe that affirm him to be <hi>all things.</hi> When either of you come to ſee indeed, ye will acknowledg both the one and the other in a larger extent then as yet can be conceaved. Then you will tell me the meaning of this Riddle, which man cannot but account madneſs, <hi>There is every thing beſides the Lord, and yet nothing but the Lord;</hi> Every thing ſo filled with <hi>creatureſhip,</hi> as if it were quite empty of the <hi>Creator,</hi> and yet the Creator every where ſo every thing in every thing, as quite to drown the whole creatureſhip in all its being and motions.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>There is evil.</hi> So ſay I too, to all eyes but one: But if you will ſay there is evil to that eye, you ſpeak beyond your bounds: you know not that eye, what it is, nor what it ſees, and you venture too far if you ſay it ſees either good or evil. Theſe are the colours wherein things appear to your eyes, but the colour wherein that eye ſees things is not yet known, nor can be ſeen by any eye but that which dyes in perfection, and riſes in perfection.</p>
            <p>This is the great quarrel that I have with you and all, That ye
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117810:13"/>
will be meaſuring all things by your own meaſure. And all ſhall lye under condemnation in this reſpect, for judging things ſo to be in themſelves, as they appear to them. The Painter ſhall be juſtified for putting ſeveral colours on one and the ſame ſubſtance, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſeveral eyes and lights to ſee each of them by, but all ſhall be condemned who juſtifie any ſort of theſe colours in oppoſition to the reſt, and ſo paſs ſentence both upon all the reſt, and upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſelf. And this is the whole work of man, to be picking out the colour that ſuits with his eye, and to be exalting it, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others flat. And as often as he changes his eye, his light, his colour, ſtill he takes the ſame courſe, and therefore ſtill in all his changes deſerves to come under the ſame condemnation.</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>There is a Hell, into which they ſhall be caſt who vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently break the Law of God,</hi> but do you know what <hi>this Hell</hi> is, what <hi>this Law</hi> is, or who are <hi>the breakers</hi> of this Law? I know according to your preſent meaſure you do, and ſo do others accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theirs, but do you know by the true ſtanding meaſure? Man by ſeveral meaſures judges righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs, but when God comes to meaſure, that which man calls righteouſneſs will be found unrighteouſneſs too. That which is righteouſneſs in the ſcale of God is very weighty, but that which man heaps up in treaſures, thinking to be very rich, and of great value, when it comes to the true Touchſtone will prove but droſs. Who ſhall ſcape <hi>Hell,</hi> when all <hi>the unrighteous in the eye of man,</hi> when all <hi>the unrighteous in the eye of God,</hi> are caſt into it? He that can be content to pleaſe himſelf in eſcaping Hell, where others muſt ſcorch in unutterable torment, is he righteous? Oh how my Soul loaths all that which all men call <hi>Righteouſneſs!</hi> I ſee as much need of a proportionable <hi>fire</hi> to burn it up, as to burn up wickedneſs. And oh that <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting flames</hi> were once univerſally let looſe upon the <hi>foundations</hi> of it, for it, and the miſery by it, ſtands more in the way of <hi>true Righteouſneſs, and true Happineſs,</hi> then wickedneſs, and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by it, does.</p>

               <p>There is <hi>an inwardneſs</hi> of all <hi>that outwardneſs</hi> which thou beholdeſt, which is the <hi>Spirit, Strength, Life, Subſtance,</hi> of the outwardneſs. This is that which thou calleſt <hi>God,</hi> who is within all that appears, which are but his ſeveral <hi>garments,</hi> wherewith he clothes and covers <hi>himſelf</hi> from every eye, but that which pierceth through the inmoſt vail.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Life,</hi> This <hi>Strength,</hi> This <hi>Spirit,</hi> This <hi>Inward Substance,</hi> doth pleaſe himſelf to contract himſelf in, and to thruſt forth <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> which he quickens with <hi>a ſhadowy life,</hi> and infuſes into them an <hi>inſtinct</hi> of preſerving that life, that he may make himſelf the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſport,</hi> in hunting it up and down, and catching it, in his ſnares of <hi>Death and Deſtruction.</hi> It is no ſport to us (no more then it is to the <hi>Birds</hi> in the air, the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the field, the <hi>Fiſhes</hi> in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) to be hunted and caught: But it is pure ſport to him, to ſee the feveral ſubtle workings of that life to ſave it ſelf ineffectual, which was made to be taken and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>And this is his maner of proceeding herein.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This <hi>Life,</hi> This <hi>Original Being,</hi> thruſts forth an <hi>outward Being,</hi> which he endues with a life ſuitable to its outwardneſs.</p>
               <p>2. He provides food for to maintain this Life, and means to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117810:14"/>
preſerve it againſt the danger of Death</p>
               <p>3. He prepares a ſtrong one to hunt, conquer, catch and kill this <hi>Outward Being</hi> in this outward ſtate of life.</p>
               <p>Thus he does, and then lets the <hi>Creature</hi> looſe, and his engine of <hi>Death</hi> looſe, and pleaſes himſelf in beholding the ſeveral windings and turnings of the one and the other from firſt to laſt.</p>
               <p>The great thing that tends to preſerve the life of Man is <hi>the knowledg of God:</hi> (The Beſtial part may feed on other things, but that is not the Man.) But Man cannot reach the inwardneſs of them; He is ſhut out from <hi>the tree of Life,</hi> that he cannot come to eat of it, and therefore he muſt dye. The ſame Power that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in him the deſire of life, and chalks out unto him the way to life, hath ſo ſhut it up and fenced it, that there is no entering ſo much as into <hi>the Paradiſe</hi> where <hi>the Tree of Life</hi> groweth.</p>
               <p>God hath took great pleaſure in preſenting himſelf to the view of Man, in making diſcoveries of himſelf unto Man; and theſe in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gradations, that ſome go far beyond others, ſome even abound with <hi>the knowledg of God</hi> in reſpect of others. But he hath another greater pleaſure, which is to ſtrip the beſt of theſe naked, and make them ſee that theirs is not knowledg neither; only comparative knowledg, not true knowledg; It is not an underſtanding what God is, but a likening of God to ſomewhat. And this is the great difference between men, Some ſet up <hi>Idols of Wood and Stone,</hi> Others of <hi>Silver and Gold:</hi> Some have very carnal groſs imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſemblances of God, Others have more refined, and more ſpiritual ones.</p>

               <p>THere is no true knowing of God by the underſtanding of the creature. Yet it is <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord</hi> to preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the eye of the creature, and to quicken in that eye a deſire to ſee and diſcern him.</p>
               <p>Every eye was made <hi>to ſee God</hi> with, but no eye can, therefore it ſickens, languiſhes, pines and dies under a curſe, that through death and deſtruction it might paſs into a capacity of attaining that, without which it cannot enjoy it ſelf.</p>
               <p>As God made all things to ſhadow out <hi>himſelf,</hi> the <hi>excellencies</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:117810:14"/>
of the creature in every kind, to ſhadow out his <hi>excellencies</hi> in their ſeveral kinds: So particularly he made the eye of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſhadow out <hi>his own eye;</hi> and it is his own eye in a ſhadow, has all the properties of his own eye in a ſhadow; but being but a ſhadow, it can never in its utmoſt exaltation attain to the ſight of that which is Subſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man can live and ſee God;</hi> He muſt firſt dye throughly, and riſe up again in the Subſtance, before he can apprehend or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Subſtance at all in truth. He may have a taſte, a glimpſe, of the ſubſtance in the ſhadow, but yet it is but a ſhadowy glimpſe, That which is ſeen (though by him that ſees it, it be accounted very ſubſtantial) is but <hi>ſhadow,</hi> juſt like the eye that ſees it, which cannot poſſibly reach the view of any thing beyond its ſphere.</p>
               <p>The <hi>created eye</hi> is fitted to ſee nothing but <hi>colours,</hi> as colours are ſuited to the created eye: And though fools think they ſee more then colours, they ſee <hi>things</hi> in their own apprehenſion, (this thing, and that thing, and the other thing,) yet thoſe that are wiſer know they are miſtaken, and that they do and can ſee nothing but the colour.</p>
               <p>We ſee <hi>Good and Evil</hi> which colour the <hi>whole Creation;</hi> But do we ſee that <hi>Subſtance</hi> which is coloured with theſe? Or do we know whence theſe colours came, or what they are in their <hi>root?</hi> They indeed put ſeveral gloſſes upon the <hi>Substance,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it variouſly to the eye of the <hi>Creature;</hi> but do they not hereby hide it from the Creature? Does not <hi>Truth</hi> lie hid under <hi>the colour?</hi> and is it not vailed by <hi>the colour</hi> from <hi>that eye</hi> which can pierce no further then <hi>the colour,</hi> and ſo muſt either view that or nothing, judg by that or by nothing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O God,</hi> How art thou miſcoloured! Man thinks he hugely pleaſeth thee by putting the fineſt kind of paint upon thee, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding how it difigures thee, and how loathſom it is unto thee, becauſe it makes thee lovely in his eye. But know, O Man, O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined'ſt Man, God loaths to be lovely in thine eye. <hi>True Excellency</hi> can be juſtified by nothing but that which is the ſame with it ſelf. Gods Excellencies were not deep enough, if mans eye could pierce into them, or approve them, if Man could acknowledg them excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. God likes nothing of Man, and Man likes nothing of God. Indeed Man hugely likes the God that he frames in his own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117810:15"/>
The God that his eye ſees and acknowledges, is very excellent; He likes God as he paints him: But God as he is, God in Subſtance, God throwing off all this paint, and not acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be any ſuch thing, but ſomewhat elſe which the creature never thought, nor could imagine, nor could deſire him to be, This is a dreadful God, and in no wiſe deſireable. The Creature may live, and ſee ſuch a God as it frames, yea the more it lives the more it ſeeth him, and the more it ſeeth him the more it lives; But the true ſubſtantial ſight can never enter into any, till after perfect Death.</p>
               <p>O how poor Creatures coſen themſelves! They think they <hi>love God,</hi> would fain <hi>ſee God, know God, live in communion with God:</hi> And this is true in their ſence, Such a God as they have framed to themſelves they love, and would fain ſee, know and enjoy. But he who is <hi>indeed God,</hi> they are not able to bear in the leaſt in what he is. There is nothing that they ſo <hi>perfectly hate,</hi> there is nothing which they ſo <hi>ſtudy to avoyd,</hi> nay, there cannot be a greater Hell to them, then <hi>his true preſence;</hi> and how can it be otherwiſe? for he carries in his Countenance the death of all that is their <hi>Life, Joy, Hope and Happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O what an <hi>aſtoniſhing ſight</hi> will it be at the opening of the Heart of Man, when he ſhall come to plead <hi>his love to God, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God,</hi> his love to others for his ſake, &amp;c. that the contrary ſhould be mani<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

And he ſhall plainly be made ſee and confeſs that he was only the <hi>Lover of an Idol,</hi> the lover of a God he had framed to himſelf in his own underſtanding, which is in truth nothing; it is not God, but the Creatures creature, a creature which the underſtanding of the Creature hath made, whether by the help of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Scriptures</hi> it comes all to one.</p>
               <p>Is it not time for you, <hi>O ſons of Men,</hi> to look about you? Ye little think how quick and piercing the <hi>approaching Judgment</hi> will be. Ye think your ſelves very able now to juſtifie your ſelves, and condemn others: But <hi>the Light</hi> whereby ye ſhall be <hi>judged,</hi> will be far different from that Light whereby ye now judg your ſelves.</p>
               <p>O what a ſtrange thing is it, and utterly incredible, that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, Lovers of God, Performers of Righteouſneſs, in the

               <p>Wo be to thee, O holy man! O righteous man! O ſtrict exact man! It is againſt thee that <hi>true Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs</hi> hath the greateſt quarrel, becauſe thou ſtandeſt moſt in its way. It is <hi>thy wickedneſs and remoteneſs from Righteouſneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that is now to be diſcovered. Under <hi>thy skirt</hi> are found all the <hi>abominations</hi> that thou condemneſt. It is not <hi>thy Paint</hi> that will hide thee from the eye that now ſearches thee, though it doth hide thee from thine own eye. Thou muſt come to Judgment; <hi>The High Court of Juſtice</hi> is chiefly erected in reference to thee, to examine and finde thee out. And wo unto thee, for thou ſhalt not <hi>ſtand in Judgment,</hi> what ever thou thinkeſt of thy ſelf; Nay, it ſhall be eaſier <hi>for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of Judgment,</hi> then for thee.</p>

               <p>It is but a weak righteouſneſs that can juſtifie only ſuch as are under ſuch or ſuch a Law, whether of external or ſpiritual faith and obedience: But that which hath the true vigour and ſtrength of Righteouſneſs in it, can ſwallow up all unrighteouſneſs under all Laws and Adminiſtrations for ever.

               <p>To the Creature in its <hi>pure natural ſtate</hi> he appears as a <hi>Lord, as a good kinde bountiful Lord,</hi> and ſo <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency looked upon him; as one who did lay out <hi>his Wiſdom</hi> in the frame of the Creatures, and <hi>his treaſures of goodneſs and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in his tender proviſion and care for the Creature; as one who loved the being of the Creature, deſired to have it go well with the Creature, and delighted himſelf to have communion with the Creature.</p>
               <p>To the Creature in its <hi>fallen ſunk eſtate,</hi> he appears as a <hi>ſevere dreadful Iudg,</hi> as an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Life, Being, and Happineſs of it; as a Tormentor to it, as a Deſtroyer of it.</p>
               <p>To the Creature in its <hi>ſervile ſtate</hi> he appears as an <hi>harſh Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> as one that propounds Life and Death, Miſery and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon very hard conditions, ſuch as it is eaſie to miſcarry upon, but very difficult (if at all poſſible) to attain the end (the Creature hath in its eye) by.</p>
               <p>To the Creature in its <hi>Son-like ſtate</hi> he appears <hi>a tender Father,</hi> one who communicates his own Nature, Life and Bleſſedneſs freely to the Son; who as he hath begotten, ſo he taketh care of him, maketh him his <hi>Heir,</hi> keepeth his inheritance ſafe for him, and him for it. And this is an excellent ſight of God, a true, a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſight in compare with any of the former. This is his <hi>Image</hi> wherein he is ſeen: His <hi>Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Power, Love, Iuſtice, Mercy, &amp;c.</hi> which were very darkly held out in the reſt, ſhine here in their luſtre.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe appearances are written in the ſtate and in the heart of every Creature, the preſent kinde of appearance being ſtill
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117810:17"/>
ſuited to the preſent ſtate: ſo that man findes them, not ſo much by the hearing of the ear, ſeeing of the eye, or by ſearching into any Books, whether of Creatures or Scriptures, as by looking into his own heart. And man is much deceived in this, He doth not, he cannot learn ſo much either from men or books (as he thinks to do) further then they occaſion the opening of his own heart in him: for let man ſtrive never ſo much, he can learn no more then is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his own heart, and in that ſtate wherein he is.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Adam</hi> look into his own heart in the ſtate of innocency, he ſhall preſently read there <hi>a ſweet, a good, a kinde, a bountiful God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let <hi>fallen man</hi> look into his heart, he ſhall preſently read there <hi>a ſevere accuſing condemning Iudg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let <hi>the ſervant,</hi> the ſlave, look into his heart, and (in plain terms) he ſhall preſently read God a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> He may ſtrain other thoughts of God into his underſtanding, but let him look into his heart, he ſhall finde, he thinks and can think no otherwiſe of him, then as of an hard Maſter.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>the Son</hi> look into his heart, and he ſhall read God <hi>a tender Father,</hi> one who loves and takes care of him, as of himſelf.</p>
               <p>But what is all this? All theſe are but ſeveral appearances of God in the Creature, of God to the Creature. This is not <hi>the firſt,</hi> and this ſhall not be <hi>the laſt.</hi> This is not God as he is in himſelf, but God as he appears to us. All this, as it hath a time to be ſown, born, ſpring up, and live; ſo it muſt have a time to dye, and paſs away. None of this is the true knowledg, if you ſpeak properly. It is not the knowledg of God, but of the preſent appearance of God. It is not the knowledg of the Subſtance as it is in it ſelf, but as it lurks and makes reſemblances of it ſelf under a Cloud. And as he often blots out one reſemblance by another reſemblance, ſo he will at laſt blot out all reſemblances by diſcovering the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>O poor Man! why art thou ſo puffed up with thy knowledg? It is not the knowledg of the true God, at beſt it is but the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his likeneſs, (and alaſs, how little is there of this kind too?) Nor is it true knowledg, but onely the likeneſs of knowledg. Both this knowledg, and the thing as thus known, muſt paſs away for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:117810:18"/>As certainly as there was a Beginning ſhall there be an Ending, (All things that have a beginning muſt have an end,) and nothing ſhall be laſt but that which was firſt.</p>

               <p>THere is a double condemnation lying upon all men; both upon the World, and upon the People of God.</p>
               <p>One is, in that they do not ſeek to know and worſhip God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that light of <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> that is ſown in them, and would ſpring up and break forth through them, did it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive checks and quenchings from them.</p>
               <p>The other is for idolizing that which they do in any degree know or attain, which is or can be but <hi>a Shadow,</hi> and yet is ſtill ſet up by them, and magnified, as if it were <hi>the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>

               <p>Man falls ſhort, in reaching after, and comprehending the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: But for all that, how ſhort ſoever he fall, though he catch hardly the ſhadow of the ſhadow, yet he will not endure it ſhould go for leſs then the Subſtance.</p>
               <p>Search the courſe of Man throughout the whole World, Where is he who ſees, knows, worſhips the true God? Search all ſorts of Chriſtians, Where is he that knows the true Chriſt, the true way to God through Chriſt? Hath not every one ſet up the Idols of his own heart, the ſtumbling block of his own iniquity before his eyes? They think they behold God, worſhip God, &amp;c. but alaſs, it is but their own Idol.</p>
               <p>Search the courſe of Man (Vain Man, or Religious Man) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> how finde ye him there? The Jews they can judg <hi>the Heathen</hi> as Idolaters, and God he judges <hi>the Jews</hi> as Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters all along.

               <p>This is <hi>true Spirit,</hi> which can devour all fleſh, and by the ſtrength of its quickening vertue, turn it into Spirit.</p>
