            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAving ſo far condeſcended to Your firſt deſires, as to Compoſe and Preach this Sermon, I thought fit to Gratifie your ſecond Requeſt in Printing it too. The Penning of this Diſcourſe (ſuch as it is) was the work of ſeveral days; the Preaching of this Sermon coſt me a Journey of ſeveral miles, but the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof will ſtand me in no more than an eaſie compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Your deſires: Wherefore ſince you are pleaſed to eſteem your ſelves ſomewhat gratified by my readineſs to do the harder part of this ſervice, I thought it imprudence to diſoblige any Perſon amongſt You, by refuſing to do that other part, which will be done with ſo much facility.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, I have another deſign, and that a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable one too, in the Publication of this Diſcourſe: I need not tell you, that many of our Countrymen, who are Perſons of fair Eſtates, and in a Capacity of being more bountiful to the Poor, than moſt of us who met together, were detained from our Feaſt by the importunity of their other Affairs. The abſence of ſuch Perſons, as it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred our Meeting the leſs conſpicuous, ſo did it make our Collection the leſs Magnificent.</p>
            <p>Peradventure the putting of this Diſcourſe into theſe
<pb facs="tcp:94123:3"/>
Men's hands, may at once open their hearts and purſes too; and excite their Charity to ſuch a degree, that they may Contribute towards our Poor ſomewhat more in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, than they would have done in publick. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Publick Acts of Charity, eſpecially if conſiderable and great, do become exemplary; yet through that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, which lieth deep in the heart of Man, they are attended with this great inconvenience, that they alone are expoſed to the danger of oſtentation, which every good Man fears, leſt it corrupt the beauty, and alter the nature of his Charity, and render it a Sacrifice rather to himſelf than to his Maker.</p>
            <p>However, if you pleaſe to convey one of theſe Diſcourſes into the hands of ſuch Gentlemen, who had an Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Feaſt, and would have come but could not: the very Title Page at firſt view will mind them of their Country and Duty too. And probably they will not think their Charity ſo far excuſed by their abſence from our Feaſt, as to contribute nothing to the Poor Man's Baſon, nor pay ſome few mites at leaſt for the laying of their Trenchers.</p>
            <p>And although ſuch a preſenting of ſmall Books to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, hath ever been eſteemed a kind of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; yet 'tis the moſt Gentile and Ingenuous way of doing ſo, and if it be but tolerable in any other caſe, 'tis highly commendable in this. Remember who they are for whom we begg; the Poor Orphan, who perhaps, if we do it not for him now, muſt beg for himſelf for ever. And if there be any imputation and diſhonour in this begging of Ours, being only deſigned to prevent that of other perſons, and perhaps whole Families too, let it all be Charged, and Reſt upon</p>

            <p n="3">3. Conſider we the Deſign and End of their Celebration; and what that was, we may ſee diſtinctly in theſe Three Particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt and Principal deſign of theſe Feaſts in the Text, was the Glory of God, that bountifull God, who furniſhed their Table for them.</p>
            <p>'Tis St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Command, <hi>Whether ye eat or</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The ſecond deſign of theſe Feaſts was to beget, betwixt Chriſtian and Chriſtian, a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual correſpondence, acquaintance and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, where as yet it was not; and to confirm and increaſe it, where it already was.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The deſign of theſe Feaſts was to extend and expreſs their Love towards ſuch Chriſtians as were indigent and poor; the former being an act of common friendſhip, but this of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Charity.</p>

            <p>The Hiſtorical Account of theſe Feaſts in the Text being thus diſpatcht, the Practical Part, which is of preſent concern to this Aſſembly, doth now ſucceed. That there is a Feaſt this day intended, I need not tell you; Only my requeſt is, That the Feaſt of this time may prove like the Feaſt in this Text; an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Feaſt of Charity indeed.</hi> And that it may be really ſuch, we are obliged to imitate the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Example of the Primitive Chriſtians, and to do at our Feaſt, at leaſt in ſome proportion, what they did at Theirs. And here give me leave to recommend to your Practice theſe Three Particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94123:8"/>
1. Let us, in this intended Feaſt of Ours, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, I will not ſay, the Frugality, but the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and Temperance of Theirs.</p>
            <p>True it is, we are not obliged to feed upon a little Bread or Fruits, as they did; for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the courſneſs of their Proviſion did ariſe from neceſſity and want of better, or elſe from their own Election and Choice, we cannot tell; but this we know, ſo bountiful is our God, that he did never reſtrain either Them or Us from the ſober uſe of his choiſeſt Creatures. But although our indulgent Father do give us that Liberty, which our elder Brethren did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want, or would not uſe, as to the Quality of our Food; yet we have no permiſſion to be Gluttons or Drunkards more than They.</p>
            <p>We may ſometimes, upon good occaſions, pleaſe our Palates, and gratifie our Taſt; God is pleaſed now and then to allow us, not only the bare nouriſhment, but even the pleaſure of His Creatures; but withall, we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver indulge our fleſh ſo far, nor pamper it ſo high, as to render that the Governeſs of our Spirit, which ſhould and muſt be under its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith well in this Caſe, <hi>That whoſoever eats too little, Civem enecat, he ſtarves a dear Citizen,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>his own body;</hi> but whoſoever eats and drinks too much, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem nutrit, he nouriſheth an Enemy;</hi> the only Enemy, which Chriſt would not have us feed, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> our ſinful fleſh.</p>
            <p>There are indeed, in this debauched Age of ours, a Generation of Men, that feed high, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94123:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drink deep, and that, as may well be gueſſed, with a deſign to nouriſh, not themſelves, but their Vices; their end is to excite and quicken their luſts, and make themſelves the more Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantick, ſturdy and able ſinners: the full Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is only deſigned to prepare them the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Adulterous Bed. Poor ſilly Men! who deſerve our juſt indignation, yet need our compaſſions too; Men, who with their own teeth dig themſelves a way, not only to the Grave, but Hell; for, whereas other ſinners do eat and drink damnation to themſelves at God's Table, theſe Men do it at their own.</p>
            <p>And ſhould there be any ſuch Perſons found in this Aſſembly, I muſt ſay as our Apoſtle doth, <hi>Theſe are ſpots in your Feaſts of Charity.</hi> Spots indeed, that deſerve to be quite wiped off with ſhame, ſcorn, and juſt abhorrence; perſons, that deſerve to be excluded from all converſe with men, and numbred amongſt thoſe ſilly beaſts, who do beſt love, and moſt devour that very food, which fats them ſooneſt, and prepares them quickeſt for the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us, in this intended Feaſt of Ours, imitate the Primitive Chriſtians in thoſe Feaſts of Theirs, as to the innocence of our Diſcourſe and Table-talk.</p>
            <p>What our Elder Brethren did in this matter, we have already ſeen, and what St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in this Caſe, we cannot well be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 20.</note>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94123:9"/>
that is corrupt and rotten, do at a Feaſt? Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, that's naſty; Trenchers, that are foul; a Diſh, that's dirty; and Meat, that ſtinks, no man would away with: But alas, what's all this to the Gueſt of an unclean and wanton Tongue? There is no man's breath, that ſtinks like his: What <hi>Tertullian</hi> told the drunken Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, may we tell the ſcurrilous Chriſtian, <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctibus</hi>

And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, not only the ſcurrility, but even the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of Table-talk.

            <p n="3">3. Let us, in this intended Feaſt of Ours, imitate the Primitive Chriſtians in thoſe Feaſts of Theirs, as to their Deſign and End; and that's double.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let Our Feaſt be, as Theirs was, a Feaſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94123:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Mutual Love, Amity and Friendſhip. 'Tis St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Command, <hi>Love as Brethren;</hi> the <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 8.</note> Relation is Ours, and conſequently the Duty is ſo too. We are Brethren by Common blood, as Men; by our common Nation, as <hi>Engliſh-men;</hi> and by our common Religion, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but if theſe General Conſiderations are not enough to oblige and endear us to one another, there is yet a more particular Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhould engage us; We are Brethren as born in one and the ſame Shire; for, <hi>Patria eſt communis Parens,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Roman</hi> Oratour, <hi>Our Country is our common Mother;</hi> and that Country is <hi>Oxford</hi> too; for although we were not all born within that Cities Walls, yet we were within its Precincts and Neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>And ſhall any Perſon, that ever breathed within or near to <hi>Oxford</hi> Air, prove unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unkind? The Univerſity is uſually ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Alma Mater, the Benign, Courteous, and Indulgent Mother;</hi> ſo loving and tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that methinks Her Example ſhould reach, not her proper Children only, but even the remoteſt of her Neighbours too: She doth not allow the leaſt Diſputes, except it be thoſe friendly ones within Her Schools; She clothes all her Sons, and many of her Citizens too, with the Gown, that Emblem of Peace; Her Pulpits preach this Leſſon; and that bleſſed Bible, which She bears in her Scutcheon, doth require us to be kind and friendly; not to bite like Dogs and Serpents, not to puſh and gore like furious Bulls; but to bear one anothers

burdens, like that kinder Oxe, from whoſe courteſie, I had almoſt ſaid, from whoſe Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, our Mother did at firſt receive, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains her Name.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let Our Feaſt be as Theirs was, a Feaſt of Charity to the Poor. What the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did, <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, <hi>Divites &amp; Paupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res pari victu utebantur; there was the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi>

               <hi>made for the Poor as for the Rich.</hi> But that's not all; as we ſhould admit the meaneſt of our Country-men that are preſent this day, to our Table, ſo let us feed ſome abſent ones at their own; let us relieve the one from our Trenchers, and the other from our Purſes; and indeed amongſt thoſe many Diſhes, that are provided for our ſelves, methinks there ſhould be at leaſt one Baſon for the Poor; that ſo ſuch as are at a diſtance from us, may feed upon our Bounty, though they do not taſte our Feaſt. And here three things muſt be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<list>
                  <item>1. What muſt be the juſt meaſure of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</item>
                  <item>2. Who muſt be the objects of our Charity?</item>
                  <item>3. What are the Motives to it?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What muſt be the juſt meaſure of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? What muſt we give, and how much? We anſwer, there is no certain Rule to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to every particular perſon in this Caſe; but in General, we muſt proportion our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by this double Meaſure:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Meaſure of our Charity muſt be our own Ability; true it is, we ſhould all be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94123:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as Generous and Noble as they, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth thus commend; <hi>They were willing beyond</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>their Power.</hi> Our Soul ſhould be larger than our Purſe, our Charity ſhould be bigger than our Alms; our Will ſhould be above our Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but our Deed according to it: So 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>Let every one lay by in ſtore, as God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 1.</note> 
               <hi>hath proſpered him,</hi> &amp;c. Such was the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians. <hi>The Diſciples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 11. 29.</note> 
               <hi>to ſend relief unto the Brethren:</hi> But how much was given by this and that particular Perſon? the Text ſaith, <hi>Every man according to his Ability:</hi> And thus it was in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nuſquiſque ſtipem apponit, ſi modò poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tert. Apol. c. 39.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Every man gave more or leſs, as he was able.</hi> And the truth is, whoſoever giveth leſs, than he is very well able, is unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to his Neighbour; and whoſoever gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more is uncharitable to Himſelf and His.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Meaſure of our Charity muſt be our Brothers want: By this Rule did the Saints of old proportion their Charity too; <hi>Diſtribution was made unto every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 35.</note> 
               <hi>as he had need.</hi> And here we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, not only the degree of our Neighbours want, but its occaſion too: If a Man's Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do ariſe from his Idleneſs, Debauchery, and Vicious Courſes, though our Charity muſt not let him ſtarve in hopes of his Reformation; yet our Prudence, to make him Exemplary, may juſtly let him ſmart and pinch; but where a man's wants are ſore, and occaſioned either
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94123:11"/>
by the greatneſs of his charge, or any ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that were inevitable; the expreſſions of our Charity, and the meaſure of his Relief muſt be proportionable to his need.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould I mention any Rules for the juſt Proportions of Charity in this Aſſembly? 'tis obſerved to the juſt Honour of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> That whatever good works they do, they do them Nobly. If a Citizen Found a School, probably he makes it like a College: If a Citizen builds an Alms-houſe, he doth it with ſuch Magnificence, as if it were deſigned rather for a Prince than Beggars: If the City build a Church, with what ſplendour 'tis done, theſe very Walls, and this very Pulpit would ſpeak aloud, even without a Preacher. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Old Churches of <hi>London,</hi> lately burnt, and newly Reſtored, are like ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Plate, melted down indeed, but ſo Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially made up again, and ſo neatly burniſh'd, that they are become more Glorious through the fire, and do only ſhine the brighter: So that whatever the City might loſe by the late Conflagration, the Church, through their Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, hath proved a Gainer. Wherefore, if any man demand what ſhould be the Rule and Standard of your preſent Bounty, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, let it be your ſelves: What St. <hi>Paul</hi> once blamed in other Men, will be no fault in you, <hi>Meaſuring themſelves by themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Do <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 12.</note> but you this day conſult your ſelves, your own bowels, your own eſtates, your own wonted generoſity; do but give like Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94123:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and then, with a due reſpect to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your Eſtates, give meanly if you can: But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who muſt be the Objects of our Charity? give we muſt, but to whom? Doubtleſs we muſt not exclude from our Charity any Soul, that doth either deſerve or need it; but ſince our Ability cannot reach to all the world, we may pick and chuſe for our ſelves ſome ſuch Objects, on whom our Charity will be beſt beſtowed. And who were the ſpecial Objects of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Charity in their Ancient Feaſts, <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> tells us, <hi>Pueris &amp; Puellis re &amp; Parentibus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Tert. Apol. c. 39.</note> 
               <hi>deſtitutis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Boys, Girls, poor Orpans, that had neither Eſtates nor Friends.</hi> And here, though I would by no means limit your Charity to ſuch or ſuch, yet I would particularly recommend Two ſorts of Children to your Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such poor Children deſerve to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to your Charity, as proper Objects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who are like to make good Men and good Scholars too.</p>
            <p>Should we but enquire from the Publick Schools of our own County, or from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Halls in our own Univerſity, we ſhould quickly hear of ſuch and ſuch Lads of ſlender Fortunes, but Vertuous Inclinations and Rich Endowments; induſtrious Youths, that would be at Work, but have no Tools; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that would be Scholars, but cannot, for want of a Tutour to inſtruct, Books to read, and perhaps bread to live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:94123:12"/>
Doubtleſs, there is ſcarce any greater object of Charity than ſuch a Child as this; a Child, that's Pregnant and Promiſing; to train up ſuch a Child as this in a courſe of Religion and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſuch a Service to God and his Church, that 'tis ſcarce within the reach of any private Man's Charity to do a greater. For, tell me, who knoweth what a rare Man ſuch a poor Child may prove hereafter? Were it fit, it were but eaſie, to name ſome Perſons, that have been choice Inſtruments of Honour to God, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to our Church, who in their Minority lived on Alms.</p>
            <p>And if our bounty this day ſhall be placed on ſome ſuch lucky Object, who can tell, but we may train up a Perſon of that Worth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, for whom the whole Nation may be obliged to bleſs both God and Us? Perhaps a few Books, now beſtowed on ſuch a Child, may render him hereafter a walking Library; a little Money, given him now, may make him Rich hereafter; our Cap may be changed one day into a Mitre; our Cloth may be turned into Sattin, and our Linnen may become Lawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleeves.</p>
            <p>And methinks there is no ſort of Men more obliged to this kind of Charity than We; doubtleſs, we are more concerned to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the promotion of Learning than other men; this is the great Profeſſion of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Univerſity, which is the Glory of that County, whereunto we owe our birth. For, whereas other Counties Glory in ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94123:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Commodities and Manufactures, 'tis Ours that Glorieth in Liberal Arts and Nobler Sciences. 'Tis the Glory of ſome Counties, that they can furniſh the Chimnies of this vaſt City with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fire, 'tis the Glory of other Counties, that they can furniſh your River and Ciſterns with conſtant Water; 'tis the Glory of ſome Shires, that they furniſh your Shambles with Meat, and your Shops with Cloth; Well, and what's the Glory of our Shire? Hath <hi>Oxford</hi> nothing to oblige <hi>London</hi> with? Yes, 'tis our Counties Happineſs and Honour, that it can furniſh your Inns of Court with Learned Lawyers to ſecure your Eſtates, your City with Learned Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to preſerve your Lives; and, above all, your Pulpits with Learned Preachers to ſave your Souls: And if ſo, what Man amongſt us, that hath any Value for himſelf or his Native ſoil, will not contribute ſomething towards the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of that Learning, wherein the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Country, and the ſafety of his own Eſtate, Life and Religion are ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such poor Children deſerve to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to your Charity this day, as are like to make Vertuous Men, and good Citizens too; if you train up ſome eminent Scholar, you will do an Honour to the place of your Birth; and if you breed up ſome eminent Citizen, you will much oblige the Place of your Habitation.</p>
            <p>Paſt all peradventure, there's many a Child to be found, whoſe Natural Genius doth lead him rather to the Shop than to the Study; their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94123:13"/>
Parts do very well diſpoſe them for Mechanical Trades, but not at all for Nobler Arts; your Scarlet Gown may become that back, on which our black one would be ridiculous. 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that many a Child may make a Golden Lord Mayor, who would have made but a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Biſhop.</p>
            <p>And is it not a thouſand pities to ſee ſuch poor Children ſtand at the door and beg, who might have done ſo bravely within the Shop? Were it not pity to ſee ſuch perſons in Rags and Tatters, who, with a little help, might have worn a Chain of Gold? Were it not pity to ſee ſuch become the Nations ſhame and burden, who, with a little encouragement, might have done a great deal towards its ſupport and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit? To prevent ſuch a ſpectacle as this, give me leave this day, in their ſtead, to become the Beggar, though I would not be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of your Charity, yet for once give me leave to ask it.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, amongſt the many poor Children of our County, 'tis eaſie to pick out ſome that are promiſing and hopefull, Lads of plodding heads and active hands; Lads, that might do far better in the Shop, than at the Plow. To place out ſuch Lads as theſe, to find them Work and Wages; an honeſt Employment, a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Maſter, and a fitting Maintenance, is that great Act of Charity, which I would beg this day.</p>
            <p>And for your Encouragement in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, do but remember, what brave Citizens
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94123:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have already been made even of Alms-boys; to name Perſons is needleſs, and would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom too. Only conſider, what hath been the happy iſſue of other Mens Charity may as well be the bleſſed event of yours; who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but ſome poor Apprentice, trained up by the bounty of this day, and fed by your Feaſt of Charity, may prove a man of thoſe Parts, that ſignal Prudence, Eſtate and Honour, as to become the Governour of this Great Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis? Who can tell, but a Lord Mayor of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> may for once be made even at Drapers-Hall? there by your private Purſes now, and elſewhere by Common Votes hereafter?</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, leſt any Man's Charity ſhould yet prove more cold, than the very diſh, that ſhould receive it, give me leave to propound ſome proper conſiderations, that may revive, warm, and make it freſh; and that's the buſineſs of our third and laſt Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider we what great Inducements man hath to be Charitable; give we muſt, and that conſiderably too, but what's our incouragement? ſurely, the greateſt that can be; ſee what it is in Four Particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Commands of God do oblige us; Commands, that are expreſs, frequent and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent too; ſo the Evangeliſt, <hi>Be ye mercifull as</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk 6. 36. 30.</note> 
               <hi>your Heavenly Father is mercifull;</hi> and ſo again, <hi>Give to him that asketh;</hi> and yet again, <hi>Charge</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>them that are rich in this world, that they be rich in good works,</hi> &amp;c. We cannot be uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94123:14"/>
to Man, but we muſt be diſobedient to God too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Example of Chriſt doth much oblige us: <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour; <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 29.</note> but what muſt we learn? Certainly, amongſt other Leſſons this of Charity is one; ſo reaſons great St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who preſſeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to Acts of Mercy by this very Motive, <hi>Ye know the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who, though</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>he were rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor,</hi> &amp;c. So charitable was the Son of God, as for our ſakes to give himſelf; and ſhall not we ſo far tread in his ſteps, as for his ſake to give a trifle? But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The great uncertainty of all Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the mutability of this World, and our own concerns therein, doth much oblige us; ſo various are the Providences of God, and ſo changeable is the condition of Man, that he, who is now in a fair capacity to extend his Charity unto others, may, in ſome ſhort ſpace, come to want and beg it for himſelf. 'Tis very poſſible, that a diſhoneſt or careleſs Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a Thief, or a Fire by night, a ſtorm, a Rock, or a Pirate by Sea, a crack and flaw in a Title, ſuch or ſuch a ſad accident, which eaſily and frequently happens, may utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe us. And if in ſuch a caſe we ſhould think our ſelves fit objects of other Men's Charity, 'tis but reaſonable that we ſhould now eſteem that poor Neighbour, who is in a like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be a meet Object for our own: So argueth the Great Apoſtle, <hi>Remember them</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 3.</note>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:94123:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>which ſuffer adverſity;</hi> but what's his Motive? <hi>as being your ſelves alſo in the body.</hi> The Text imports, That ſo long as we are in this uncertain world, we are expoſed to the ſelf ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, loſſes and calamities with other men; and conſequently we ſtand obliged to extend Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whilſt we are able, as well as to expect it, when we are ruined.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe great Rewards, which do attend our Charity, do much oblige us. That there is a Reward for the Charitable Perſon, our bleſſed Saviour doth thus ſecure him, <hi>Thy Father him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall reward thee;</hi> the very loweſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Charity God will not ſuffer to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall give to one of theſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 42.</note> 
               <hi>little ones a cup of cold water only, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward:</hi> 'Tis ſure, a reward there is, but what an one is it? Is it ſuch an one as will reimburſe, recompenſe, and make us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for what we part with? Yea, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of our Charity are of Two ſorts, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal: What are theſe Temporal Rewards, we may ſee diſtinctly in Four Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Rewards of our Charity are ſuch as concern the ſafety and welfare of our Perſons: What is the Charitable Man's Privilege in this reſpect, the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>The Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 41. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>him in time of trouble: The Lord will preſerve him and keep him alive: The Lord will ſtrengthen him upon the bed of languiſhing,</hi> &amp;c. The Text imports, that the welfare of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is much concerned in the right ordering
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94123:15"/>
of our Purſes; the way to ſecure our health, and ſweeten our ſickneſs, is to Fee, not ſo much the Phyſician, as the Poor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Rewards of our Charity are ſuch as concern our common credit and reputation in the world: For although our Bleſſed Saviour forbids us to make our own honour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe the deſign of our Charity, yet the iſſue and event thereof it will be. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The memory of the Juſt ſhall be bleſſed:</hi> This <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 7.</note> Juſt Man is the man of Mercy, the ſame man that <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>He hath diſperſed, he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 112. 9.</note> 
               <hi>hath given to the poor:</hi> What then? <hi>His Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs endures for ever, his Horn ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 27.</note> 
               <hi>with honour:</hi> The beſt way to eternize our memories is to be exemplary in doing good; <hi>Do good, and dwell for evermore.</hi> 'Tis Charity that Embalms a Man's name, and keeps it freſh and ſweet for ever; there's no Tomb like an Alms-houſe, no Monument like an Hoſpital, no Marble like the Poor Man's Box.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Rewards of our Charity are ſuch as concern our preſent Intereſt and Eſtates even in this world: 'Tis one of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſeeming Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes, <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 11. 24.</note> But who is this lucky Man? the next Verſe tells us, <hi>The liberal Soul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth ſhall be watered again.</hi> A little water poured into a Pump, fetcheth more; and a little money put into the poor Man's Purſe, doth often bring much greater ſumms into our own. There is no man ſo good an Husband even for this world, as the man of

Mercy; nor doth any perſon prove ſo ſure a gainer, as he that gives; ſee that Command and Promiſe of Chriſt; <hi>Give, and it ſhall be given unto you;</hi> but how much, and in what quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 33.</note> good meaſure, preſſed down, ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running over. Money rightly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is not loſt, but rather lent out to uſe; 'tis like Seed, ſcattered indeed here and there, but yet it groweth and multiplies even to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>He that ſows bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully:</hi> Indeed, a common ſower may poſſibly over-ſeed his Ground, and by a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh hand ſpoil his Crop; but in our Caſe there is no danger; the more Seed we can ſpare and ſow, the richer Harveſt ſhall we reap.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Rewards of our Charity are ſuch as concern our Poſterity too: Thus the Pſalmiſt, <hi>He is ever mercifull and lendeth;</hi> there's the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a Charitable Man; but what's his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? <note place="margin">Pſal. 37 36.</note> 
               <hi>His Seed is bleſſed:</hi> And thus ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that forenamed expreſſion of <hi>Solomon, The Memory of the Juſt ſhall be bleſſed:</hi> The <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 7.</note> Memory! what's that? the Child, the Son that bears his Fathers Name, and keeps it up and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the world; this Son ſhall be bleſſed, this Child ſhall be ſo far from being injured by his Fathers Charity, that it ſhall rather tend to his great advantage. And ſurely this conſideration doth totally remove that vain pretence and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of men, who are afraid to do any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able acts of Charity, leſt thereby they impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh their Families, and leave their Children beggars: But</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:94123:16"/>
2. There are ſuch Rewards of our Charity, as concern another world; Our Saviour tells us, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull:</hi> He doth not mean in <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 7.</note> this life only, but in the next. 'Tis in order to this, that he thus commands us, <hi>Make to your</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 16 9.</note> 
               <hi>ſelves friends of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, that they may receive you into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:</hi> and upon the ſame ſcore he tells us, <hi>He</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 41.</note> 
               <hi>that receiveth a Prophet in the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſhall receive a Prophets reward:</hi> but what's that? certainly, 'tis a Reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>And that we may not doubt the certainty of theſe great Rewards, and ſo our Charity grow chill: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us what ſecurity we have, and who it is that ſtands engaged; <hi>He that hath pity on the poor lends to the Lord, and that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 17.</note> 
               <hi>which he hath given will he repay:</hi> That we may be encouraged to ſupply the poor Mans wants, God himſelf hath drawn a Bond, and offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the poor Mans Surety, and the rich Man's Debtor.</p>
            <p>And can our Charity expect any greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement than this? It's true, when ſuch or ſuch a Man would borrow, perhaps we ſuſpect his Honeſty, perhaps we ſuſpect his Ability, perhaps we are jealous of his Security, and that makes us loth to lend; but doth the Caſe ſtand ſo with God? When God would be our Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, do we think, that he will not be our Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter too? Is not he to be truſted, that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, juſt and true? Is not he to be credited for a few pence or ſhillings, who is Lord of all that

Heaven and Earth are worth? 'Tis for ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie's ſake, that our bleſſed Saviour doth thus command us, <hi>Lay up for your ſelves treaſures in Heaven:</hi> the Text imports, that Money given <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 20.</note> the poor is not idlely ſpent, but ſecured in the Treaſury of God, and Exchequer of Heaven: And although the Moſt Juſt and beſt Natured Earthly Prince may ſometimes be conſtrained by a neceſſity of State, and againſt his own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to ſhut up his Exchequer; yet can we imagine that the Great God of Heaven will ever put a ſtop to his Treaſury, and the Bankers and Creditors there ruined too? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We think great Summs ſure enough in the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> and dare we not venture ſome ſmall matter in the Star-Chamber of Heaven? Doubtleſs our Principal will be ſafe, and our Intereſt both ſure and great; if there be a Reward for the moſt inconſiderable Alms, even a cup of cold water, O what Reward will there be for higher Acts of Charity! Our Saviour tells us, <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 35.</note> 
               <hi>thirſty, and ye gave me drink,</hi> &amp;c. Well, and what then? what's the Reward of this? a great one ſure! <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Dear Lord! here's Principal and Intereſt indeed! a little meat given, and a Kingdom received! a little drink lent, and a Crown repaid! a little cloth beſtowed, and a Throne returned! Yea, here's the fruit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; what the poor borroweth, God payeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over; well may <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum</hi>

               <hi>give thus and thus to pious uſes is to gain;</hi> to give ſo and ſo to the Poor, is to become a Sacred Uſurer; becauſe whatever man thus gives, God refunds, yea, God repayeth for every penny a pound, and for every mite a talent: And if ſo, if our Feaſt this day ſhall prove like the Feaſts in my Text, a Feaſt of mutual Love amongſt our ſelves, and a Feaſt of Charity to ſuch as deſerve and want it; we ſhall find a friend in Heaven, that will do more than pay our Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.</p>
