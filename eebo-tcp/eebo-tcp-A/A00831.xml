            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VVherefore if I ſhould wiſhe vnto your Lo. in a thouſande tearmes many ſeueral and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſings, and afterward include them all in one, truely it muſt be this, that you may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know the God of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſerue him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart and a willing minde: Knowe him I ſay, by learning what he willeth, and ſerue him, by daily practiſing, as hee ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, of that will.

VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (my good Lorde) with all chriſtian care continue your happie courſe in the waies of the Lorde, and what Salomon ſaith, remember often: Heare counſell and receiue inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

remaine among vs. For him that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs, and thus dealeth with vs from day to day, doth not verie ſenſe inſtruct vs, we muſt ſerue againe, if we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy him? And is this to ſerue him, to retaine vnto ourſelues the wages, that hee hath prouided for ſufficient men, and to thruſt into his cloth we care not whom? To furniſh his harueſt with i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle loiterers, and neuer to looke after, no, nor accept beeing offered, moſt painefull laborers? No, no, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, that muſt iudge it, it is not. Yea men themſelues knowe it, if the Lorde would giue feeling, and ſtrength to defie that ſpirite of hauing, that crieth within and ſaieth, reſerue it to thy ſelfe. Yet leaſt anie ſhould pretende the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, where I wiſh them well reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of this point, may it be lawefull for mee, with your louing leaues ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lay downe in this behalfe, that I would wiſhe him to conſider, who is not perſwaded of this dutie, if I were to ſpeake with ſuch an one? Firſt then I would haue him viewe the worde of God that ſhall ſtande and iudge vs
<pb facs="tcp:8844:11"/>
all, when heauen and earth ſhall periſh. Than the which woorde nothing can be more contrarie to this ſinne, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee reſpect the time of the lawe, or of the Goſpell. For in them both this is euer deliuered, and euer bet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the people of God ſhould be taught, and men choſen out in abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſuch, as the people might <hi>require the lawe at their mouthes,</hi> though the meaſure and manner were diuerſe as it pleaſed God to giue his giftes vnto them. Which thing euer drewe with it then, and at this day ſtill truely doth inferre, a godly regarde, and euen a neceſſarie conſcience, when anie place is voide, by the lawes wee liue vnder, alotted to that vſe, to furniſh it as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie as wee poſſiblie can and may for that vſe. Otherwiſe by vs it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe that the people are not taught. Nowe this offence groweth either by negligence, or by couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. By negligence when (not weighing or feeling the ſinne of it) we are drawen by affection, or kindred, or other mens ſutes, to beſtowe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:8844:12"/>
places vpon inſufficient perſons. By couetouſneſſe, when to reſerue a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our ſelues, we doe the like. Both which are greuous offences both againſt God and our countrey, and in the word very plainely condemned. If the firſt be the cauſe, then craue I moſt heartily the conſideration of theſe, and the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. The Lorde threatneth to the watchman death that warneth not his people, and ſaith he will haue <hi>their bloud at his hande,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 3.</note> becauſe hee did not crie. Nowe by me hath beene put in ſuch an one verie careleſly and negligently for affection or ſuch like, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though he would yet for want of ability can not cry, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las how then can I want my portion in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of the Lorde that is threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch default? Secondly it is loue in the miniſter to his God, to <hi>feede his ſheepe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 21.15.</note> So is it aſſuredly in the patrone to cauſe them to bee fed. Contrariwiſe it is want of loue in the miniſter,<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> if he do not feede, &amp; is it not aſmuch in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, if by his default it come to paſſe? Thirdly it is a great fault we think to giue the calling to an vnworthie one, and is it
<pb facs="tcp:8844:12"/>
no fault to giue the liuing to ſuch an one? Thus then we ſee howe the word quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our conſciences in this behalfe if we be not dead. And a number mo reaſons might yet be brought, if I ſhould make a treatiſe in a preface. Only this one mo I muſt needes remember which me thinke ſhould awake anie man aliue in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixt of Marke it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>that going out and ſeeing a great multitude of people gathered together,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note> 
               <hi>he had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them, becauſe they were like ſheepe without a ſheephearde, and hee went out and taught them many thinges.</hi> And in the Greeke it is more vehement, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing as it were an aking of his heart, as we call it, or a yearning of his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, to ſee ſo pitifull a ſight, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie people without a teacher. Vpon which notable place I haue vſed in my ſelfe to make two concluſions. Firſt a comfort, then a feare. My comfort is this, that he which mourneth to ſee his people want the benefite of his worde, will giue his people his woorde if they ſeeke it and wiſh it, and where he hath vouchſafed it alreadie, there continue it,
<pb facs="tcp:8844:13"/>
bleſſe it, and giue it power if we pray. For otherwiſe howe ſhoulde it paine him to ſee it wanting? My feare is this, that if his heart ake to ſee his ſheepe depriued of a ſhephearde, hee will aſſuredly bee reuenged euen in great wrath of them that are the cauſers of it. And for Chriſt his ſake let it bee conſidered. For as wee liue, wee may not alwaies looke to laugh, if we make our God to mourne. Thus then if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence be the cauſe that a countrey is not furniſhed with ſome able miniſters, me thinke we may awake our heartes by the worde of the Lorde, and weying it well, receiue from him ſome better fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in ſo great a matter. But if couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be the cauſe, and we greatly giuen to ſequeſter that benefit to our ſelues, ſauing onely ſome portion to one to beare the name, then marke we againe the witneſſe alſo of the ſame ſcriptures againſt vs euen in this. And to ſaue mine owne labour, my iudgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young, heare I beſeeche you the proofes and reaſons againſt this ſinne, by a godly and graue Diuine intreating

this as another, &amp; knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effect &amp; hauing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profit of theſe his labors, and daily reaping it, being, and abiding in the place where this ſeed was caſt, I thought I ought to doe as willingly and as readily as anie other. If for no other cauſe, yet to commende this eſpecially to them, to bring foorth further fruite among whome it was firſt ſowen, and in whoſe heartes I doubt not, but it tooke roote nowe long ſince. An eſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this worke, if I would take that way, might be drawen from the workeman of it moſt plentifully, from his ſtocke, and kindred, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuch like; which becauſe it is rare fruite on ſuch trees, to ſome may make it ſeeme the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but I paſſe ouer theſe ſhewes and outwarde leafes to decke it with, it hauing ynough in it ſelfe to commend it, leaſt if I ſhould long ſpeake of this colour, and grace, I ſhould ſpeake the leſſe of him, or of the thing it ſelfe, minding not to ſpeake much of either, &amp; but litle in all. And as I paſſe the ſtocke from whence this graft was taken, ſo will I not ſtand to ſhewe you where it was ingrafted &amp; planted, in what vniuerſitie, in what Colledge, what roote he toke, what ſufficient time he grew, howe he ſpred there, and with what liking, which would make this fruite to many not without cauſe to realiſh the better. But to come to that which commeth nearer to the bringing forth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of this worke, when hee was firſt planted by a fellowſhippe in that famous Colledge of the holy, and vndiuided Trinitie, in Cambridge, wholly, or moſt eſpecially conſecrated to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of him, and his knowledge, whoſe name it

Nowe hauing there painefully laboured by the ſpace almoſt of two yeares, and ſeene the effect of that promiſe, with what meaſure ye mete,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Mark.</hi> 24.</note> ſhall be meaſured to you againe, and vnto them that haue ſhall more bee giuen, that though he caſt in with full hande, and euer a zelous heart to doe good, in a continued courſe; yet God ſo bleſſed, that the harueſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounded his labour, and exceeded his hope; and that litle towne was a candle light, ſet on a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticke, and a tower vpon the toppe of a hill. When God to his comfort had thus encouraged him in his lawe, he by great meanes calleth him from this litle towne (where he had no paſtorall charge) to a greater charge, and in reſpect of the change, and dignitie of the place whither he was called, it was as it were from <hi>Tecon</hi> to <hi>Bethel,</hi> from preaching in ſome vplandiſh, and countery towne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwere to this your firſt doubt thus: that the argument is not good, neither foloweth, that béecauſe all thinges are doone by his prouidence, therefore hée ſhould be author of euill. For one may bée author of an action, &amp; yet not of the euil in the action: as in this ſimilitude wée ſée: If a man cut with an euill knife, hee is the cauſe of cutting, but not of euill cutting or hackling of the knife, but the badneſſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8844:44"/>
of the knife is the cauſe of that. Againe, if a man ſtrike the ſtringes of an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is out of tune, he is the cauſe that the ſtringes ſounde, but that they ſounde iarringlie and out of tune, that is in themſelues, and the man that ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth is not to bée blamed for it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſéeing one maie bée the cauſe of an action, and yet not of the euil in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you ſée it doth not folowe, that if God bée the cauſe of the action, by and by the euill in the thing muſt néedes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo procéede of him. Nay contrarilie this doctrine is a ſealed truth, That no euill commeth of GOD in any worke, but though in euerie thing that is done, the Lord bée ſome worker, yet as he doth it, it is euer good.

the breache of this Lawe. And if it pleaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde to bleſſe me with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his trueth, or any thing elſe whatſoeuer, I ſée that in this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement I am charged to giue thankes to him for it in ſuch full manner and meaſure of féeling, as any way is due to that benefite.

            <p>Now for the firſt opinion, it is out of all queſtion falſe and too ſuperſtitious. For howſoeuer the Turks receiue not ſuch profe, yet we that imbrace &amp; cleaue to the authoritie of Gods worde, know that the Lorde hath not lefte this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement neither any other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out large and plaine expoſition in other

places of the ſcripture, and therfore we are to conferre place with place, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with precept, and ſo to ſée whether in déede all images be forbidden to be made or no. Firſt then marke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes in <hi>Leuiticus:</hi>

For, as I ſayde, they are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of GOD in the place of <hi>Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> as thinges like equally forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.

Nowe thinke with your ſelfe, would GOD eyther haue commaunded ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be made, or aſcribed the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to doe ſuch woorkes to the grace of his Spirite, if in this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen and publiſhed before the time he had ſimplie forbidden the ſame in all reſpectes?

GOD ſhould be contrarie to him ſelfe, and therefore the <hi>Turkes,</hi> or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer elſe ſo thinkes, are deceiued. The ſame might yet further be prooued by the commaundement of GOD to make the Braſen Serpent, and by Chriſtes not finding fault with <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> image vpon the money that was ſhewed him, and many proofes moe if néede were. For the ſeconde opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them that thinke it lawfull to make any picture, yea euen of GOD himſelfe, and to ſet them vp in Churches, ſo long as no worſhip is doone to them as they are bare images, there is great cauſe why they ſhould be gaineſaid and reſiſted euen in both. But eſpecially in the firſt, for they oppoſe themſelues to the true ſenſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, to diuerſe other plaine Scriptures, to the nature of God, to reaſon, and to the iudgementes and practiſe of godlie men, as by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar viewe of euery one appeareth.<note place="margin">

before, and is moſt true, that it is chiefly to forbid al pictures of God, as the moſt groſſe blindeneſſe and impietie of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bicauſe he may not be imagined to be like either man or woman, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature.<note place="margin">

And to ſet vp a picture of God not like him, whether it be to offende him, and to diſhonor him, if otherwiſe we cannot conceiue it, let vs iudge by our ſelues, who quickly woulde take it in great ſnuffe, if one picturing vs ſhould make either the eies too great, the noſe too long or high, the eares, mouth, armes, hands, or any thing wrong.

of our owne will the beſt wee can ſay, is that it commeth from a good meaning and intent, and therefore wée thinke God cannot of his mercie refuſe that which is well meant, and intended towardes him: I beſeeche you marke howe the Lord here ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vtterly this defence, ſaying in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes, that they bee haters of him and ſo led with the liking of their worſhippe from the Lorde and his true ſeruice, that when occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth they bewraye extreme hatred thereunto, perſecuting it with fire and fagotte in the true profeſſours thereof. O my brethren if GOD repute mee for an enemie, what can my pretended loue auayle mee? If hée ſay I hate him, howe dare I ſtill bewitched with my follie, thinke I loue him?

with our good intentes and honeſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as wee thinke, when yet his owne tongue ſpeaketh it, that if I ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerue with him any other, as ſaints, Angels, images, or whatſoeuer, or him alone after any other way, than he preſcribeth, I loue him not, but hate him, yea euen extremely hate him, and ſhall at his handes finde the rewarde of a deadly enemie to his glorie? Nowe Chriſt for his mercies ſake touche vs and giue vs féeling. Secondly let vs marke againe in theſe the compariſon of mercy and iudgement together, how farre the one excéedeth. His enemies and haters of his will he puniſheth but to the thirde and fourth generation, but ſheweth mercie to thouſandes of them that loue him and kéepe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes: Who woulde not ſerue then, and onely ſerue a God of ſuch a nature? Yea what heart is it that will not ſéeke to pleaſe according to his will ſo good a Lorde as powreth mercie ſo long after his deceaſe vppon his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring and poſteritie?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:8844:83"/>Laſt of all, it is verie worthie obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, howe that ſpeaking here of his commandements, he placeth loue before it, ſaying he will ſhewe kindneſſe to thouſandes of them that loue him, and kéepe his commandements. As though he woulde haue vs knowe that theſe two cannot be ſeparated, but whoſoeuer frameth himſelfe to obey the Lorde, he muſt néedes loue him before, for out of that, as out of his fountaine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per head, floweth the other, not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted elſe nor liked of if it doe not, and contrariwiſe if wee doe loue the Lorde in déede, in trueth, in veritie, then will wee keepe <hi>His</hi> Commaundementes, marke it, <hi>His</hi> Commaundementes, he doeth not ſay then will hee deuiſe this thing, and that thing, with twentie things moe of a good minde and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to pleaſe GOD withall, but we will then kéepe <hi>His</hi> Commandements, that is, wee will then ſéeke and ſearch, wee will then reade and heare euerie man, wee will endeuour to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed what GOD in his worde
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8844:84"/>
hath preſcribed vs to doe and wee will kéepe <hi>His</hi> commaundementes. Nowe then once againe, euen as the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt is deare vnto vs, let our brethren of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> (for ſo wee yet call them in hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment) looke and marke what loue of GOD is in them. Héere is a note, and elſe often repeated in the Scripture to knowe their loue by. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las they deuiſe lawes, wayes, and meanes, euerie day to ſerue GOD withall of their owne heades, but his preſcribed rule in his worde they vtterly contemne and neglect. Now where true loue of GOD is, out of it floweth a burning conſtant care to kéepe <hi>His</hi> commaundementes, not our owne. They kéepe their owne and with fire and fagot doe reuenge the breach of them, but the Lordes worde not ſo, with abſtayning from this meate and that meate, this day and that day, with ſingle lyfe, though moſt impure, with prayers in an vnknowen tongue, and thus often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8844:84"/>
ouer and ouer, with croſſings, and créepings, Paxes and Beades, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie water and Creame, Aſhes and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, with a thouſande ſuch things haue they deuiſed to worſhippe the Lorde, and who ſo breaketh theſe, an Heretike hée is, a runneaway from the Church, cite him and ſummon him, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him and impriſon him, burne him and hang him, yea away with ſuch a one, for he is not worthie to liue vpon the earth. But if he blaſpheme the name of the Lord by horrible ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,<note place="margin">

Either he is not puniſhed at all, &amp; moſt commonly ſo or if he be, it is a little pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their owne inuenting by belly or purſe, or to ſay a certaine of prayers, to viſit ſuch an image in pilgrimage, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But all this deſerueth neither fire nor

Can it be denied but that he that puniſheth the breache of his owne lawes aboue the breache of Gods lawes, in that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe before GOD? Surely it cannot, it is too plaine, &amp; therefore once againe remember that the loue of God in man or woman draweth them to the kéeping of <hi>His</hi> commandements ſet downe in the worde, and not of their owne conſtitutions deuiſed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And thus much in briefe of this commandement.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The examination of the conſcience.</head>
               <p>Nowe if I woulde fruitefully medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and thinke of this commandement ſecretely, and ſhortly with my ſelfe, as I did of the former, then conſider I, that as in other ſo in this alſo, little is ſaid, and much is meant, part is put for the whole, and in the negatiue the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8844:85"/>
is implyed. Therefore thus doe I take the commaundement, as if it were ſaide, Thou ſhalt not worſhip me with any carnall, earthly, ſuperſtitious or outward deuiſed worſhip by thy ſelfe, &amp; namely not by images, but in heart, in ſpirite, in truth, as is commaunded in my worde. Which when I knowe, if I would at any time rip vp this heart of mine, and diſcloſe vnto my ſelfe my ſecrete guilt and ſinne herein againſt my God, I carefully conſider, and as I can in minde beholde, howe I haue euer ſerued the Lorde, or thought in iudgement that he might be ſerued. And peraduenture I finde, that liuing in the daies of ſuperſtition and blindneſſe, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of God and his truth, for feare &amp; weakeneſſe with others, I haue bowed my knée to <hi>Baall,</hi> worſhipped ſtockes and ſtones, or as I thought GOD in them, &amp; euen béene polluted with groſſe and grieuous idolatrie. For which if it ſo haue béene, what can I ſay? Shall ignoraunce excuſe mée? Did I labour then and euer by all meanes poſſible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8844:86"/>
to knowledge? Or liued I rather careleſly as others did, thinking it good that many followed, and hauing or ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no better grounde for my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than the practiſe of my forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, kings and gouernours? If of this latter my heart condemne me, how ſhould my ignorance excuſe me, ſince it was ſo plainely wilfull? Shall good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or my good meaning ſtand for war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant before my God? Ah howe ſhall he that gaue me in charge expreſſelie, that I ſhould not doe what ſéemeth good in mine owne eyes, but what he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, accept for excuſe my wilfull and ſtubborne diſobedience? Neyther ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce therefore nor intent may warraunt ſo witles walking before the Lorde, but onely pardon in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus my Sauiour. But if eyther age, which then was young, or other proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Lorde haue freed mee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes from ſo groſſe idolatrie, yet ſéeke I further whether with any outwarde thing elſe whatſoeuer, not warraunted by the word, I haue thought or ſought
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8844:86"/>
to ſerue and pleaſe the Lorde, being by reaſon thereof, brought aſléepe with an imagination of my well doing, and ſo careleſſe to ſéeke or practiſe the dueties of the word. If I haue, this alſo knowe I to be a breach of this commandement. Then from things not warraunted, I came to things commanded, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word, prayer, conference pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable with my brethren, and ſuch like: knowing that if euen in theſe by the Lorde ordayned, as thinges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is honoured and pleaſed, I haue otherwiſe vſed my ſelfe, than I ſhould, in ſtead of perfourming the Lordes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, I haue brought before him mine owne inuention, walking vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly in mine owne wayes, &amp; fearfully broken this precept of my God. Which when I conſider, I néede no further ſhewe of grieuous guilt to caſt me down from height of all ſuppoſed ſoundnes in this law. Mine eyes do ſée, my heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, my conſcience crieth, my ſinne is great. Stand O ſoule before the Lord, the iuſt and vpright Iudge, whoſe

And ſay now ſoule before the Iudge of trueth, haſt thou alwayes vſed as hee hath willed thée, the hearing of the worde? Did neuer deſire of worldlie praiſe prouoke thée to this ſeruice?

Thus ſeruing the Lord in a thing commanded, not as he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, I ſerue him with mine owne inuention, and guiltie moſt grieuouſly I am before him. O that I were any better in the duetie of prayer. Am I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer negligent, colde, and froſen? Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the fire within me before, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt I ſpeake with my tongue? Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my fleſh with the vehemencie of my ſpirite? Neuer ſtraieth my heart from preſent praier? Neuer haſt I to an ende, or wearilie wiſhe the voice, I heare to ceaſe, it is too long? Ah wretch, howe dare I ſay it? Conſcience cryeth and will not be bribed, this duetie of prayer thus corruptly perfourmed, the Lorde acknowledgeth not as a ſeruice by him commaunded, but as mine own inuention, and a breache of this his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. My conference with others in ſhewe ſo good, in words ſo faire, taſteth it neuer of liking of my ſelfe, or vaine delight to heare mine owne diſcourſe, of

pride to ſéeme and to be knowen a man indued with ſuch and ſo good gifts? Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth my heart in trueth to the praiſe of my God, and the comfort of my hearers, whenſoeuer I ſpeake of fruitfull things without all vaine reſpect and hidden e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill whatſoeuer? If it doe not, then the thing that in it ſelfe the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as I perfourme it, he vtterly abhorreth, and it is wilworſhippe of mine owne, not preſcribed dutie by my God: therefore a breache of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.

Is the Roode a God, the Maſſe a God, your faith and trueth a God, &amp;c. Is the bodie of Chriſt a God? is his bloode a God, his armes, ſides, féete, &amp; hearte ſo manie Gods? If they bee not, howe ſweare we by them then ſo vſually and ſo fearefullie? We heare what GOD ſaith by the Prophet, namely that they that ſweare by anie thing that is not God, do flatly forſake the true God him ſelfe, and will we not marke it?

tearme it, be done or may be doone by a charme, but whether it be or may bee doone lawefully by the ſame, or no. And you heare the word of God plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemning the practiſe of it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with what conſcience can wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue health or anie helpe whatſoeuer either to our ſelues or ours by that meanes that GOD hath ſo feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned vengeance vnto, were we neuer ſo ſure to obtaine it by the ſame? Secondly what benefite ſoeuer we reape by ſuch forbidden meanes, I dare aſſure you all thinges conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wee gette no good, but muche harme. For what GOD will not haue doone, GOD is neuer the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, worker, and cauſe of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and directly, but health or anie helpe to our ſelues or others by charming, the Lorde will not haue procured: therefore of that health and helpe ſo gotten, aſſuredly the Lorde is neither author, worker, nor cauſe directly. If then not the Lorde, who but the diuell? And if it be he, as moſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8844:95"/>
aſſuredly it is he, then I pray you let vs all men and women thus reaſon with ourſelues: Is the deuill our friende or our foe, our welwiller or our enemie?

And will euer he that hath euen ſworne the woe of vs all, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that is with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and indeuour, with might and maine, with tooth and naile as we ſay, with his candle in his hande light leaſt by any meanes we ſhould eſcape him, applyeth his whole power to deſtroy vs and to bring vs to endeleſſe calamitie, wil he I ſay euer do vs any good, thinke we, but to the ende to inferre thereby a greater plague vpon vs? Certainely he will not: for he were not the deuill if he ſhould, and we may be as aſſured of it, as we are ſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath that name and nature. Then I ſay let vs marke. We
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8844:95"/>
finde by a charme, bodily helpe in our ſelues or ours. But this would neuer Sathan haue done, vnleſſe he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en that the vſing of meanes forbidden by God would ſting our bodies &amp; ſoules to eternall death in the worlde to come. Then ſée ſtill I ſay, and note it. Good he doth vs in bodie, that a thouſande times more euill he may worke both to body and ſoule in the day of iudgement. Temporall eaſe he is content to beſtow vpon vs, that endleſſe diſeaſe, miſerie and woe he may procure vnto vs. This is moſt true, and nowe what good doth charming if all thinges be conſidered? Shall a Chriſtian man and woman ſo hunt for helpe of body or goods, that they ſhall for it looſe bodie and ſoule eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Shall our health and wealth be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to vs than the Lordes commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? God forbid, and therefore let vs reſt perſwaded, howſoeuer wee thinke ſuch vngodly meanes procure vs good, yet in déede all thinges conſidered, it is no good: For Sathan being our foe will neuer doe vs good but to the ende to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8844:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hurt vs more by it, and the breache of Gods commaundement will ring our ſoules a paſſing peale from face and fauour of the Lorde. Laſt of all (which eſpecially I thinke you would heare) I denie that by the charme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing at all is doone, whatſoeuer the wordes be. For euerie action muſt haue a fit and conuenient meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto the patient to be doone by, but bare wordes, <hi>Pater noſters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uees,</hi> and <hi>creedes,</hi> characters and figures are no meanes appointed of the Lorde to doe any cures by, either vppon men or cattle, and therefore if any thing be doone, aſſuredly it is not doone by theſe thinges as the true &amp; working meanes, but by the deuill himſelfe bléering our eies by theſe ſhadowes. And this vaine opinion verie <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could mocke and diſdaine as abſurde and fooliſh, <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo with diuers others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Que. <hi>But howe prooue you by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that bare wordes being good words be not forcible to this ende?</hi>

And therefore we may ſée it is not the charme that can doe any thing by vertue of the bare wordes. And you can not ſay that vnto the wordes come any faith and good minde of the charmer, for faith leaneth vpon promiſe, and promiſe annexed to a thing maketh it lawefull: but charming hath neither promiſe in the word, nor is allowed, but by name expreſſely forbidden and condemned.</p>

And if they went further than their commiſſion, were their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent neuer ſo good, it was reiected. Sometimes they vowed in aduerſitie, to the ende that if it pleaſed the Lorde to deliuer them, they might not onely in generall, but euen in ſpeciall ſhewe their gratefull heart to the Lorde for the ſame. Thus vowed <hi>Iacob</hi> at his going to <hi>Padan Haran,</hi> and manie moe in their ſeuerall diſtreſſes.

Example is <hi>Dauid</hi> promiſing to builde the Lorde an houſe, with manie others. So euer hath the Lord kept man vnder his hande and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction touching religion, hating the bouldneſſe of man preſuming to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent any ſeruice of himſelfe. I anſwere you therefore I ſay and you ſée it, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> might not vowe what they liſted and what they meant well in, but

it neuer pleaſed the Lorde that drewe ſinne with it in the other hande, as the vnchaſte vowes doe of chaſtitie in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſuch like.

vnder a title and an vſurped name of a Church to chalenge authoritie to doe matters both contrarie to pietie and comelineſſe, becauſe the true Church of God hath doone what was moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them both. But now as I ſee the bond vnto any particular day only, &amp; to ſuch ſtrict reſt in the ſame as the Iewes obſerued, is taken away by Chriſt, ſo yet ſee I what is morall remaineth, namely a day in ſeuen, and a certaine reſt in the ſame. Wherefore I deſire aſwel to know the reaſon of the remaining of the one, as I haue the cauſe of the abrogation of the other: and therefore firſt I pray you why haue wee ſtill yet a Sabaoth and ſhall haue till the ende of the world: and ſecondly, what reſt and exerciſes are therein required?</hi>

But as I can I will lay before you ſome of them. And firſt to begin withall, foraſmuch as without knowledge of God there is no loue of God, without loue no faith, &amp; without faith no ſaluation by God, therefore it is a worke or exerciſe of the Sabaoth, a duetie that we are ſtraitely bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in that day to attend to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of God, by aſſembling our ſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one place, and there with feare and reuerence to heare, marke and lay vp in our hearts the worde of God read or preached vnto vs.</p>

And if he be at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church in the forenoone, for the after noone it is no matter, he hath béene verie liberall to God in giuing him ſo much. What day in the wéeke vſually doeth he giue ſo euill an example of vnmeaſurable ſotting in bed, as on the Sabaoth? But O filthie ſauour that ariſeth out of this lothſome chanell, thus raked vp into the noſtrels of the Lorde! I ſpare to ſpeake, I ſhame to ſée, I rew to knowe what I fully knowe againſt our ſoules in this reſpect. Let euerie man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

more particularly view the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and lay open vnto the Lorde their ſinne in ſorowe for it, by this occaſion thinke what is commaunded, looke what wee haue done, &amp; the Lorde make our ſinfull hearts to ſée, &amp; ſigh for ſo great offence againſt our God. What ſhould I ſay of the ſecond end of the inſtitution of the Sabaoth, namely for the reſt of ſeruant &amp; cattell? But euen in an word, woe to the man whom God ſhall iudge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his guiltineſſe herein. For it is too vſual with al eſtates to be a meanes to robbe their ſeruauntes of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing due to the kéepers of this law, and to pull vppon them the plague for the contrarie by making them ride and run, poſt and away, vpon euerie occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that commeth in their heads, when in truth if they would but euen look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the matter may be done wel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch haſt. O happie is that man whoſe heart thinketh howe his ſeruant is bound to this commandement of kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping holy the Sabaoth as well as hée, hath a ſoule to looſe or ſaue as well as he, to be nouriſhed with the foode of the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8844:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
word as well as he, and therefore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concludeth, he will neither ſinne himſelfe nor make his ſeruant ſinne in breach of this or any other commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The third end of the Sabaoth we heard it was, that hereby might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in ſome ſort our ſpirituall reſt in heauen, wee ceaſing from our owne workes, &amp; dooing the will of God. But are we able to ſay, wee haue this doone? O miſerable men ten thouſand times if in this we ſhould haue our deſertes: for wherein or howe crucifie we the fleſhe more on this day than any other, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the frowarde deſires of the heart, reſtrayne our owne nature, and doe the will of God more on this day than any other? Alas our owne conſciences crie vnto vs, we doe nothing leſſe, wee drinke, wée eate, wée ſurfet, wee ſweare, we play, we daunce, we whore, we walke and talke idlely, vainely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanely and vngodlily: theſe are our workes on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sabaoth more commonly than any day in the wéeke elſe, and if this bee to reſemble a ſpirituall reſt, then in déede wee doe it, not otherwiſe.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8844:127"/>
Thus ſtand wee therefore guiltie and gréeuouſly guiltie of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that if we had not a Sauiour who in our fleſh had fulfilled this lawe and euerie one for vs, and appeaſed the wrath of God his father, iuſtly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt our ſinnes, neuer ſhould we haue looked within his kingdome. And howe ſhall we bée better for all which he hath doone, but by ſéeing our paſſed ſinne, and namely our fowle and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe abuſe of this Sabaoth of our God, by lamenting the ſame euen from our hearte rootes, purpoſing vnfainedly to amend it hereafter, and euen euer while life endureth to bee more carefull to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God on this day than we haue bin, and by ſtedfaſtly beléeuing in Chriſt, and for Chriſt, and by Chriſt, to haue all that is paſt forgiuen? This is the way to bee freed from the curſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and all other which we ſo gréeuouſly haue tranſgreſſed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iuſtly deſerued.

Hath it béene holy, graue, and modeſt, and ſo remayneth as néere as we can, ſéeking to hide from the eyes of their witleſſe heades, ſuch wantes as we knowe our ſelues ſubiect vnto? No no, but careleſly and looſely, euen in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place, parentes bewray neglect of religion, they will goe to the Churches or good exerciſes when they liſt, and that verie rarely, they ſhewe no regarde of the dutie of Chriſtians, they carie no grauitie in their doinges, no modeſtie often in their behauiour, but liue moſt diſſolutely and often incontinently, they ſweare fearefully without regarde, ſpeake prophanely not reſpecting the frailtie of the youth that heareth them, father and mother let vnkinde ſpéeches paſſe from them one towardes an other in the preſence of their children, to the great impayring of their credite with them, careleſſe God knowes of their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:8844:151"/>
bringing vp, and too full of fooliſh pitie when they ſhould correct them. All theſe are meanes to make the children faile in reuerence to their parentes, and to tempt them to ſinne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs looke if we be parentes, and gréeued with vnreuerent regarde in our children of vs, whether wee our ſelues be not cauſers of the ſame. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, for their obedience it faileth oft by fault in vs. For if we be Parentes, we lay great burdens vpon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, preſſing them ſtill with our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, we inioyne them what we liſt, not weying well what they can like, and not carefully conſidering aſwell their natures, as our owne deſires, aſwell their comfort and conuenient beeing, as our owne affection and will to haue it ſo, what maruell if often GOD breake our heartes with their diſobedience? The like may be ſaide of that thankefull main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynaunce that ſhoulde of children to their Parentes be performed. The very vnnaturall and vnkinde dealing of Parentes with their children in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8844:151"/>
their youth, denying them reléefe, and comfortable helpe, maketh them often (though it ſhould not) when they haue attayned to anie eſtate, to deale as vndutifully with their née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Parentes againe. Conſider therefore I ſay, if wee be Parentes, what cauſe we giue, and compare it with the fruite wee finde in our ſeede. Let ſinne appeare, if wee haue offended, and let the lawe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs, if wee haue tranſgreſſed. For ſurely what duties this lawe bindeth all children to perfourme, it as ſtraitely bindeth all parentes to deſerue. The Parentes euill excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the childe, but it maketh him guiltie of his childes offence. Thus may the reſt alſo deſcende into themſelues. Too apparant is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in our liues of Magiſtracie and authoritie. Wee honour them not as Parentes, but both in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, obedience, and maintaynance of their ſtate by retribution of ſome part of that wee haue got by them,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8844:152"/>
we bewray vngodlineſſe, and ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lorde and them very grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly. For where is that heart that riſeth vp in thankefulneſſe for them to our God, that obeyeth them ſecretly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as openly, for conſcience not for feare? Nay O ſin of ours, if it be ſought out by the Lorde in this reſpect, euen growen aſſuredly vp to heauen. For howe dare we and doe we defeate their lawes continually? Howe ſet wee our ſhiftes againſt the wiſedome and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Lorde by them? We mocke the Lorde and ſwell in pride againſt him. For be he as wiſe as he will in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Magiſtrate to a lawe to rule vs by, we ſhortly after wil be vp in wit againſt him to ſhake in péeces by a ſhift all his indeuour. Truely our heartes be dead, our ſinne is great, &amp; the Lorde hath wrath in ſtore, if this our dealing with our parentes be not confeſſed and amended. Thus deale we alſo with our miniſters and ſpirituall fathers beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs to the Lorde. With moſt vile vſage we often abuſe them, and if not, yet in heart at leaſt as the refuſe of the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8844:152"/>
worlde we eſtéeme them. Let God be iudge or our owne ſoules what baſe and ſcorneful concepts we harbour of them, and whether in trueth, as parentes they be loued, accompted of, and delt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. What ſwelling pride in youth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aged? What vngratefull handes and heartes againſt our great and gainefull friendes? Euerie way, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie way guiltie we are of the breache of this commaundement, if wee can ſée it. Magiſtrates alſo, and miniſters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aſmuch for their great offences in their callings, ſo that if in iuſtice we be repayed, ſhort ſhall our liues be heere on earth, and in the world to come eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death. Who can ſay he hath doone the duties of a gouernour? who can ſay he hath liued lawefully as an inferiour? Alas we are touched all with ſinne, and robbed by it of all the bleſſing. Yet ſinne eſpied and truely loathed, findes euer pardon. For this cauſe Chriſt died, that we ſhould not be damned if we will be taught. Thinges paſt be gone, and the Lorde forgiue vs. Some be to come, and the Lorde ſtrengthen vs. Whether

we be parentes and haue not deſerued, or we be children, and haue not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, the Lorde hath mercie if we doe amende, the Lorde hath loue, if our liues doe ſéeke it, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo if perſwaſion profit not.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I muſt néedes thinke that the practiſe in a Chriſtian common wealth being naught and vnlawfull, the death that therby inſues, is horrible murther, and condemned in this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nowe that to fight a combat in a godly ſtate is not tollerable, it may eaſily appeare if you weigh the cauſes for which it is at any time taken in hande. For if they be not (as it will appeare) ſufficient to warrant it, then is it not warrantable. The firſt cauſe that is alleadged for it, is to trie a trueth, which otherwiſe can not bee knowen ſay they. But it may bee anſwered that the ende good, doeth not by and by make the meanes good: to try out a trueth is good, but to try it with the hazarde of life, is more than can be warranted. There are manie lawefull meanes to finde out trueth by, and if all thoſe faile, then is it euident that the Lorde for ſome cauſe reſerueth it to himſelfe for a ſecret, and to ſéeke
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:8844:156"/>
importunately and impaciently by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie meanes (as a combat is) to finde it out, is to tempt the Lorde, and euen as it were by violence to draw from him the manifeſtation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which as yet he would not haue reueiled. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the one partie is innocent, yet either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſireth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of an other indifferently, ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> murder is in the hart of both of them, which amongeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhoulde not be countenaunced. Sometimes the combat is craued for vaine oſtentation of corage &amp; ſtrength, many a <hi>Thraſo</hi> thinking his glorie to ſtande in the chalenging of an other to vngodlineſſe, but this I hope no man will ſay to be a good cauſe for a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to admit of a combat. Sometimes to auoyd or reuenge ſome great diſgrace offred to a man, he beggeth thus to fight. But a Chriſtian man that muſt make an accompt at the day of iudgement of his life giuen him from aboue, muſt learne to eſtéeme more of life, than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, (if honour by lawefull meanes may not be kept) and more of God, and his commaundement, than of them
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:8844:157"/>
both. Beſides the profeſſion of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is to heare euill and to ſuffer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill though hee doe well, and deſerue ſo: therefore farre ſhould wee be from yéelding to ſuch heates. Some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge that it endeth ſtrife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be admitted: but to this may ſerue the aunſwere to the firſt cauſe alleadged for it. And beſides, who knoweth not that howeſoeuer it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it betwixt thoſe two, becauſe the one of them dyeth, yet layeth it the foundation of euen deadly hatred in the heartes of all their frindes, ſeede and poſteritie, ſo that for one which is killed there ſtarteth vp an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred diſcontented heartes, ſéeking and following all occaſions of ſtrife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies. Therefore in peace and at home howe a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate may allowe the combat, wee finde no ſufficient cauſe and warrant. For the fielde yet ſome doe thinke it is méete, and that they haue reaſon for it, for ſay they when two armies are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:8844:157"/>
in battle together, if vppon cauſes it bee iudged fitte not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde the loſſe of manie, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte it to two champions, either ſide agréeing to yéelde vppon the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of their man, who can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this? But we anſwere that as yet the combat in it ſelfe is not proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued good, but is euill: and to doe euill that good may come of it, wee may not. Againe in ſuch a caſe as this, we muſt conſider, not onely of the men and their ſafetie, but alſo of the cauſe and his honeſtie. The cauſe is certainely either good or euill, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iuſt or iniuſt. If it bee good and iuſt, then is not the credite of it to bee layde vppon one man one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the mocking of iuſtice and right: and if it bee euill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, then of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate not one mannes life is to be ſpent in it, and for it. Yea but ſay they yet further, the partie that hath the good cauſe is farre the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and not able to ſtande if they
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:8844:158"/>
once ioyne all together, and therefore this other way of two to trie all, is good. And we anſwere alſo further, that this were a maruelous diſtruſt of Gods mercie and power not tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in a Chriſtian. For if the cauſe be good, and méete to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, then is the cauſe the Lordes, the men the Lordes, and hee ſaueth not by bowe nor ſpeare, nor by the multitude of an hoſte, ſo that wee ſhoulde ſo regarde theſe, but giueth victorie at his will to the weaker, and driueth away, as the winde the duſt, verie mightie force aſſembled againſt him, and his children. Therefore not euen yet doe I ſee a cauſe to beare out anie combat. If there be anie corruption in menne that iuſtice bee not doone (which ſometimes alſo is a cauſe alleadged) we muſt ſay as hee ſayde, committing our ſelues and our matter to GOD. <hi>

For firſt ſaith hee, what if a woman do it to ſhunne pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her body, or after ſhée is polluted to flie the ignominie following vpon it? And he anſwereth to it, that the firſt is wicked and procéedeth of this error, that whatſoeuer is doone in vs, the ſame is alſo doone by vs, which is not ſo. For then were chaſtitie a vertue of the bodie and not of the mind. It is not for a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſay, this will I not ſuffer, but this wil I not do. The mind being ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body is filthie though it neuer did act, but not contrariwiſe: for the bodie
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:8844:159"/>

And therfore this excuſe, ſaith <hi>Auſten</hi> can not warrant ſuch ſin as to kil ourſelues. For flying of ſhame which would follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fact, neither yet may it be doone. For the ſhame is not ſo great as the act, and therefore if the déed done vnto her may not warrant her, the ignominy follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may not do it. <hi>Si non est impudica quae inuita comprimitur, non est illa iuſtitia qua caſta punitur.</hi> That is: <hi>If ſhe be not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt which vnwilling is oppreſſed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it no iuſtice whereby the harmeles is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. <hi>Sed mulier auida laudis metuit, ne quod violenter paſſa eſt dum viueret, puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur libenter paſſa ſi viueret.</hi>

Firſt therefore me thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very originall of apparel ſhould much mooue a Chriſtian féeling hart. For <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had ſinned, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were we clothed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had loſt our honor, then were we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled:</hi> ſo that it is the ſigne of our ſin, the badge of our rebellion, the witnes of our ſhame, and it remembreth vnto vs, what we ſhoulde wéepe continually to think, that we haue loſt. Now alas how ſmall cauſe haue we to be proude of ſuch a liuerie? Nay ſée the dulneſſe of our harts and the abſurdnes of our dealing. If a thiefe ſhould be ſaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hanging, with this condition added, that he ſhold euer weare a halter, were it not a ſtrange hardnes of his hart, if he ſhould ſo forget his fall, &amp; ſo glory in his ſhame teſtified day &amp; night vnto him by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he ſhould begin to boaſt of his halter, to be proud of it, and to make it of ſilke in ſumptuous ſort, for an orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his necke? Truly it were. And ſo it is in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a very ſtrange worke of ſathan, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould ſo excéed in pride with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing

the ſight whereof ſhoulde rather pinch his hart with ſorowe, than be ſo exalted euen out of his owne knowledge, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, which in truth (ſpeake as a good hart ſhold féele it) ſhold humble vs, beat vs downe, &amp; make vs euen with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke let our feathers fal for the foulnes of our féet. Therfore I ſay one thing me think to draw vs to mediocritie in this matter ſhould be the wel weying of the firſt beginning of apparel. Secondly the ſpéedie waſt of it is ſomething. For how can a good conſcience warrant vnto vs ſuch great charge, yea ſuch excéeding charge in a thing ſo changeable, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal giue an accompt how we beſtowed our goods?

Thirdly the miſliking of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word ſhould make miſliking in my hart of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe or vanitie in this matter.

and therefore wicked. <hi>Caſtitatis comes frugalitas, <hi>The companion of chaſtitie is frugalitie</hi>,</hi> ſayeth a learned man, and euen in apparell. I would to God, if with a Chriſtian heart anie will not thinke of theſe two laſt reaſons, yet that they woulde thinke of them with worldly wiſedome, &amp; in pollicie weigh them. For there is no man nor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo farre fallen out with religion, and honeſtie, but that if they be not ſuch yet they deſire to ſéeme ſo, and to be ſo taken. Nowe apparell in matter or forme vnſéemely robbeth them of this that they neither ſéeme nor are thought to be of manie. For touching religion, who can thinke them mortified to ſinne within in heart, who ſo ſéeme to liue to all vanitie and exceſſe without in bodie? Who can thinke they are reformed in ſoule, who are very much aboue their calling vnreformed in ſhowe? Man can not enter to the inwarde heart, but iudgeth euer by the outwarde fruite, and religion within vſeth alwaies to ſhewe men effectes without. For ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie of bodie, though our hearts neuer
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:8844:183"/>
meant any thing contrarie to it, yet doe we by apparel bring our credite in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, when it paſſeth our calling and conueniencie. And therefore euen in pollicie, if we care not for Chriſtianitie we ſhould beware. Laſt of all, modeſtie in apparell both touching matter, and forme, anſwereth to the originall of it well, which was to hide vs after ſinne, confirmeth by practiſe that apparell is vaine, liueth according to the named ſcriptures, eſcaping the threatned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and finding promiſed good, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our credite out of queſtion, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth the grauitie of the goſpell, hindreth no pietie (for often vnder an ill garment a good heart is hidden) and laſtly is ſo farre from alluring to luſt, that it euen cutteth the throte of it, and very greatly ſtoppeth it. <hi>Sex ſunt enim quae incorruptam ſeruant caſtitatem: Scili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, ſobrietas, operatio, inhibitio ſenſuum, aſperitas cultus, raritas ſermonis, euitatio oportunitatis, perſonae, loci, &amp; temporis.</hi> That is, <hi>There are ſix thinges which keepe chaſtitie vncorrupted: To wit, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, labour, reſtraint of our ſenſes,

courſeneſſe of apparel, rarenes of ſpeech, and eſchewe all of oportunitie, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, place, or time.</hi> O but yet it ſticks in our hearts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apparel makes a man. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede manie ſo iudge both of themſelues and other, that they are made, and beautified by apparell. But the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heathen man ſhall condemne vs, if we doe ſo, who coulde thus ſay, that: <hi>Ornamentum est quod ornat, ornat autem quod honestiorem facit. Id autem non aurum, non ſmaragdus, coccus, ſed quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque grauitatis, pudoris, &amp; moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis ſpeciem praebent.

So that an equalitie of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preſent is plainely ſhot at in this law. How then can they warrant their dealings to haue required loue in them, who in reſpect either of paſſed loſſe or ſuppoſed poſſible in time to come, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunce the price of the thinges they ſell, aboue the value of the things? This dealing, if you marke the wordes well, could not be allowed amongſt the <hi>Iewes.</hi> And as yet I am ignorant of any larger co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion granted to vs to wrecke our ſelues vpon our brethren, &amp; to robbe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe God in his pleaſure hath croſſed vs with loſſe, or may do hereafter.

Thirdly it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all lying in wayt to pray vpon one that muſt néeds ſell for preſent mony, to get his commoditie for halfe the value, if I can, when as rather I ſhould for pitie giue him equalitie.

We are bound by it generally to ſhowe all loue &amp; carefull regard to our neighbors goods that we poſſiblie can, &amp; to doe him with our owne goods what benefite we may. In particulars if we will ſpeake, we are bound to lend. We ſée both when and what we may, not hurting our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, profite our neighbours withal, and to take no recompence, vnleſſe it be hurt which we lend.

Manie a time doe I greatly feare haue wee litle regarded the caſe of the partie, whoſe pawne wee tooke, ſo wee might bee ſafe our ſelues from our feared loſſe.

But manie a dogged nature denyeth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and manie a couetous heart of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth in the latter. What ſay you of thinges which you haue founde being loſt? Haue you euer regarded euen as your owne to kéepe it, to chéeriſhe it, and to finde out the owner of it, the ſtraying beaſt of your neighbour, and euen of your verie enimie? Haue you neuer either of negligence, or of malice and ſpite, or by a pinching minde tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed herein? Conſider it well. And haue you neuer euen in the true teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a good conſcience retayned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing, that euer you founde, from the true owner if you knewe him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer neglected anie meanes to finde him out, if you knewe him not?

you often to offende in this duetie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las wee ſée it not, wée knowe it not, we féele it not to be a ſinne to retayne what wee finde, or almoſt to finde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be loſt and ſo to conceyle it. So gapeth ech man after worldlie gayne, and ſo ſéeke we to haue howe ſo euer we haue it, if it happen into our hands, and wee well like of it. But ſinne will bee ſinne when ſuch gotten goods will no where bée ſéene, and the Lorde giue vs féeling of it nowe betimes. Next let vs looke of our buying and ſelling, wherein alſo all loue is to bee ſhowed to our brethren, and an equalitie kept ſo néere as wee can of commoditie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and taken. But howe manie of vs doe this, there is a God that knoweth, and a conſcience within vs, that if it were wakened woulde crie I feare mee lowde, we are gréeuouſlie guiltie. For where is that man or woman of trade almoſt to bee founde that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp a ſtanding in faire or Market doeth once thinke with themſelues that there they ſtande to ſhowe their loue to their brethren as to them ſelues,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:8844:238"/>
and ſo to interchange their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with them, as that in the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of a good conſcience and euen God being witneſſe, ſo néere as they can, they kéepe an equalitie giuing as good as they take, and taking no more than they giue in value and worth. No a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las it is too well knowen and too much amongſt vs daily ſéene, that we thinke wee haue our ſtanding there to praie vppon all that come to vs ſo much as wee can, to deceiue them, to ſpoyle and robbe them in a ſort, and to get for our wares what poſſiblie wee may with an vtter neglect and refuſall of equalitie. And therefore we ſel as we may bee ſafe though wee neuer bee paide aboue halfe, wée ſell to day with a pinching price, wee make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt God maie ſende vs ſome loſſe, and therefore betimes we wrecke our ſelues vppon our brethren, and ſo take of them for that which wee doe ſell, as that if it happen that GOD doe ſo deale with vs, wee may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged before hande, and able to abide it if it bee not great. To conclude, we
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:8844:239"/>
are merieſt when we haue robbed moſt, and then goe wee ſinging home when wee haue giuen occaſion to the moſt to crie. So dull and deade are our heartes within vs, and ſo hath a grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die minde to rake vp riches ſpoyled vs of loue or any thought thereof towards our brethren. And as litle conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is often in the buyer, who if hee might haue for a pennie that is worth a pounde, coulde well inough digeſt it. And therefore if one in hys néede come vnto vs for preſent monie, wee will none of his commoditie, wée want it not, wee eſtéeme it not, wée looke lightlie both of the man and the matter till wee haue brought him to our owne price, and God knowes farre farre vnder the value of the thing. So that hee which of charitie in his néede ſhoulde bee helped, is of vs commonlie by reaſon of his néede prayed vppon and moſt cruellie robbed. And yet we be no théeues.

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:8844:262"/>
by himſelfe, where he continued by the ſpace of manie yeares. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time to them which ſo willingly and wickedly foreſware themſelues this hapned. The firſt by caſualtie of one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſparke of fire, was brent with all his goods and familie. The ſeconde was taken with a great ſickneſſe from the toppe to the toe, and deuoured with the ſame. The thirde hearing and ſéeing the puniſhment of the other confeſſed his fault, but through great repentance powred out ſuch teares, that he loſt both his eies. And thus was their falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie and witneſſe bearing puniſhed. <hi>Narciſſus</hi> after long abſence returning home againe was by this meanes both cleared of his fact, and reſtored to his biſhopricke againe. An other good ſtorie to this ende is that of king <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane, who beeing eſtabliſhed in the kingdome, cauſed a parliament at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where (amongeſt other thinges there debated) it was propounded vnto the Byſhoppes, Barons, and Lordes of the parliament there preſent, whether that in the compoſition made betwixt
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:8844:263"/>
               <hi>Edmonde</hi> and <hi>Canutus</hi> anie ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance was made for the children or brethren of <hi>Edmond</hi> for anie partition of any part of the land. Whereunto the Engliſh Lordes falſely flattering with the king, &amp; ſpeaking againſt their owne mindes as alſo againſt their natiue countrey, anſwered and ſaide, nay: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming moreouer with an othe for the kinges pleaſure, that they to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their powers would put off the bloud of <hi>Edmond</hi> in all that they might. By reaſon of which anſwere and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they thought (manie of them) to haue purchaſed with the king great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. But by the iuſt retribution of God it chanced farre otherwiſe. For manie of them, or the moſt part, ſuch ſpecially as <hi>Canutus</hi> did perceiue to be ſworne before time to <hi>Edmonde</hi> and his heires, and alſo conſidering that they were natiue Engliſh men, hee miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and diſdayned euer after. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome he exiled, a great ſort he beheaded, and ſome by Gods puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dyed ſodainly. Sée therefore the heart and hande of the Lorde againſt a
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:8844:263"/>
falſe witneſſe. Many hiſtories are there to this ende. And manie experiences e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nowe adaies of gods iuſt plagues vpon this ſinne. But I will not runne ouer them nowe. Eaſilie may they be turned too in our owne Church ſtorie. Onely theſe two I cannot omit. Firſt how <hi>Hamelton</hi> the Scot being brought vnto his death by the falſe accuſation of a falſe Frier called <hi>Campbell,</hi> when he was in the fire cited and ſummoned the ſayde Frier to appeare before the high God as generall iudge of all men to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the innocencie of his death, and whether his accuſation was iuſt or not, betwixt that and a certaine day of the next moneth, which hee there named, and ere that day came the Fryer died without any remorſe of conſcience, that he had perſecuted the innocent. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly howe <hi>Calice</hi> men in the daies of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> being falſely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſcaped ſafe from the danger of ſuch witneſſes, and they themſelues (a iuſt plague vppon their iniquitie) hanged, drawen, and quartred, ere they went home. Therefore let vs euer tremble
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:8844:264"/>
to prouoke the Lorde by this ſinne, let vs ſpeake a trueth if we doe ſpeake at all, and ſhame to lie euen of the deuill. The daily beggeries, diſcredits, ſhames and deathes, ſtrange and fearefull of ſuch as haue made no conſcience by falſe witneſſe bearing to pollute their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ought mightilie to moue vs, and verie effectually to perſwade vs neuer to doe it.

And therefore ſince it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth God, hurteth our brother, and verie greatly indamageth our ſelues, O that we would ſée it, conſider it, and as God by grace ſhall ſtrengthen our fraile natures ſcoule vppon the ſpéeche that practiſeth manies harme, and couenant with our heartes to knowe before wee credite: ſo would God bleſſe vs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie report well of vs, and true hearts of neighbour, friende, ſeruant, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer neuer leaue vs. Paſſing then on in this examination further, wee may

The former commaundementes did forbid the act and the ſetled or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting thought of the heart, though the déede were not doone, as for example, the precept of killing forbiddeth the déede, and with all, once to thinke in heart to doe ſuch a déede, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion verily to accompliſh it if I can. But nowe this commaundement commeth néerer, and condemneth not onely that thought that is ſetled, and lacketh but
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:8844:272"/>
oportunitie to doe the déede, but euen the verie thinking alſo of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the loue of God, or my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though I doe neuer conſent to it, but ſnubbe it, miſlike it, and reiect it. For euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hauing of an euill thought in my minde is a fruite of my corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as in innocencie if we had ſtood we ſhould neuer haue had, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore naught.

The former in the former commandementes was forbidden, and the later in this. A ſtrange doctrine in ſhewe no doubt to manie that thinke this their thought is frée. But we muſt not maruell, ſince euen the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe would neuer haue ſuſpected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie danger in concupiſcence, luſtes, and deſires, if the lawe had not ſayde, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt or deſire.</hi>

this commandement. He tooke himſelfe before to be liuing, and in good liking towardes God and godlineſſe, but when he had looked vpon this lawe and beheld himſelfe a while in this part of the glaſſe he ſawe himſelfe plainele to be no bodie, but a dead man ſould vnto ſinne. And therefore a thouſande times néedefull, that the Lorde ſhould adde this lawe to all the reſt, to humble vs throughly, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſingular a man was not fully caſt downe before he had wreſtled with the iuſtice of God in the ſame.

               </note> God hath made the heart aſwell as the bodie, to ſéeke his glorie, and therefore good reaſon the cogitations of the hart ſhould no more ſtraie from their true end, than the actions of the bodie. Neither may our reiection of ſuch thoughtes in the ende, and not conſenting vnto them to
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:8844:273"/>
accompliſh them in act, bleare our eies with an imagination, that we haue not offended in them, in going ſo farre as we went. For it is a blemiſh, a want, an impietie, and a degrée of vnchaſtitie in a woman to ſuffer the cogitation of anie forren friende beſide her huſbande to tickle her with conceite vnlawefull, though in the ende ſhe repulſe it, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre to accompliſh it, and howe can it then be faultleſſe in theſe hearts of ours the ſpouſe of the Lorde to dallie with ſuch delightes, and to purſue in minde, by thinking of them, the pleaſures that ſuch conceites doe pleade before vs, though in the concluſion we giue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and do not conſent. O it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter to loue the Lorde with all the heart, than that it may abide anie light licentious wandring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame for anie time. For they are oppoſed to loue the Lorde euer, and to thinke euill at anie time: to loue the Lorde with all my heart, and to thinke nowe and then of vaine follies or flat impieties with my heart. And if it be a certaine trueth as we knowe it is, which I ſaide before,

that if we had ſtoode in our innocencie firme and immoueable, we ſhould neuer haue conceiued in our time any euill thought at all, or vaine or fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite for anie moment or point of ſpace, but ſhould euer haue béene able to haue iuſtified our thoughts before God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they were as agréeing with the loue of him, and our brother, then is this tickling delight, that now and then will take vs and poſſeſſe vs for a time to inioy our neighbours houſe, his wife, his child, his man, maide, or anie thing that he hath, otherwiſe than we ſhould, wicked, vile, and againſt that rule of right, wherein we were created, and whereto our regeneration dayly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth if we be the Lordes.

For often doth the minde, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſléeping, and the ſenſes reſting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thoſe thinges which it waking conceiued, and either deſired or feared. Alſo the diuerſe complexion and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the bodie occaſioneth diuers kindes of dreames, whereby the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will gueſſe the nature of the bodie, and cauſes of diſeaſe in the ſicke. Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke men will dreame of fires and downefaules. Melancholicke men of monſtrous and horrible thinges. The phlegmatike of waters and dull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And the ſanguine of pleaſant and comfortable euentes. The outwarde cauſes are alſo diuers, as the influence of the heauens, the circumſtance of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, neceſſitie and want, ſome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning chance, and ſuch like. Thus doe hungry men dreame of meat, drunken men of moyſture, and ſo foorth. <hi>Quae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantes cogitauimus, ea ſolent poſtea dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus

O my beloued, how often haue we coueted our neighbours houſe, that is his earthly poſſeſſion and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if not in whole yet in part? How often haue wee toſſed our heades from the one ende of the pillowe to the other, not able to ſléepe, for thinking howe to compaſſe that péece and this péece, not weighing howe well he might ſpare it, but howe well it would fitte vs? Yea this houſe muſt be had, and that garden, and the other cloſe to the wringing out of teares from the man, the wife, and al their poore children that part from it, to the gréeuing of their heartes, and the verie vtter vndooing of them all. We ſtoppe not our eies that they gaze no

further vppon our neighbours helpes than a Chriſtian ſoule may warrant. We ſhut not our eares, neither take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the ſinne that may inſue, when we are whiſpered in the eare, that this thing is fitte for vs, and that thing, and thus and thus may be had. No alas we account them the beſt members about vs, whoſe godleſſe counſell ſhall worke our endleſſe woe. Whereas a Chriſtian aſſoone as hee heareth ſuch a motion, ſhould by and by thinke in himſelfe, O Lord thou haſt delt mercifully with me euer, let not me now deale vnmercifully with any, thou haſt made me a maiſter of much, this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a maiſter but of a litle. O Lorde let not my much eate him out of his litle vngodlily, let not my power oppreſſe his weakeneſſe and ſo foorth, and then talke with the informer, be it either a man, or mine owne gréedie eie, that hath ſpied it, and ſée whether what I may get, I may well gette, and well take into my hands, ſo as I may not be ſtinged for it an other day before my God, nor exclamed vppon iuſtly in the worlde. This doeth your owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

Good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued goe with me in this tryall of our ſelues, and let vs ſée ſinne to be ſinne. The looking eie, and the luſting heart further after our neighbours wife, than they ſhould, would God they accuſed vs not. What ſhould I ſay of his ſeruant, man or maide? You knowe it aſwell as my ſelfe, there is almoſt no conſcience any where ſhewed in this behalfe no feare of God, no loue of man, but onely of our ſelues. For if wee like an other mans ſeruant, for any qualitie that we deſire to be ſerued with all, what intiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, what allurementes dare wee vſe to drawe him to vs?
