            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto thoſe their pretended ſubjects (whom we ſaw malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bent) and to remove our ſelves and families further off, from the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> and ſuch their coadjutours, being then amongſt us: For we ſaw that they did not only endeavor to take away our livelyhood, but intended to take away our lives alſo, in caſe they could find a way to ſatisfie the Country in doing of ſuch an act and execution: For we had never accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation brought in againſt us, but what roſe from the Magiſtrates and the Miniſters; for we walked ſo, as to do no man wrong, only juſtified the cauſe of our Religion, as we had learned and received the principles thereof before we went amongſt them; as alſo the laws and government of this Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> unto which we ever willingly acknowledged our ſelves to be loyall ſubjects, and therefore could not ſuffer our ſelves to be intrenched upon by our fellow ſubjects, further then the laws of our King and State doth allow.</p>
            <p>Now that they ſought the lives of ſome of us, at this time is evident; For <hi>Iohn Warner</hi> Citizen and Freeman of <hi>London</hi> a man well known, who afterwards was one of thoſe againſt whom they now proſecuted, having formerly had ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with Maſter <hi>Winthrop</hi> the Governor of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> he asked the ſaid <hi>Warner</hi> (living then in the <hi>Nanhyganſet</hi> Bay) whether he knew one <hi>Samuel Gorton,</hi> (a man alſo againſt whom they now proſecuted) who lived alſo in the ſaid Bay, but at that time <hi>Iohn Warner</hi> had not ſeen him, living a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of twenty miles one from the other: The Governor told him he was a man not fit to live upon the face of the earth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo one of the Elders of the Church of <hi>Boſton</hi> told a Miniſter<note place="margin">Old M. <hi>Oliver</hi>

wayes of their Church and the carriage of his brethren con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the Miniſter, the two yong men could not have reſt in their ſpirits till they went down to adviſe or debate the matter with the Church, though they were come out from them and lived on Road Iſland in the <hi>Nanhyganſet</hi> Bay, and when they came to <hi>Boston,</hi> and the Brethren were gathered together either to give or receive ſatisfaction, when they ſaw the arguments produced by the Miniſter and his brother to weigh ſomewhat heavy, then the ſtrongeſt of their Church members of <hi>Boston</hi> (namely the Governor and Aſſiſtants) caſt them in priſon to regulate their opinion that differed from them, and there kept them in durance for many Moneths; but at the laſt, ſetting them at liberty, yet giving out ſome threatning words afterwards, as though they would fetch them again; the yong men could have no reſt in their ſpirits day nor night, till they were gone out further from the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets</hi> then that Iſland was, yea under ſome forreign govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> could not pretend to have any thing to do; for they had heard that the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take in all the <hi>Nanhyganſet</hi> Bay under their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Juriſdiction: Whereupon Maſter <hi>Collins</hi> came where the aforeſaid <hi>Gorton</hi> and his Family were, namely at <hi>Providence;</hi> and ſeriouſly adviſed him to go along to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantation or elſe to the <hi>Sweads;</hi> for, upon his knowledge, the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> intended, in ſhort time, to take away his life, if he aboad in any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations; for he had received certain information thereof, whil'ſt he was amongſt them, ſhewing great affection to move him thereunto: <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> thanked him kindly for his love, being but a ſtranger to him, but told him he could not go under a forreign Prince for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, till he ſaw further then yet he did; knowing he had neither been falſe to his King nor Country, nor to his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in point of Religion, ſo far as God had informed him. But Maſter <hi>Collins</hi> and his Brother, together with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and whole Family, for fear, removed to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with divers other friends and families; who were miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably maſſacred by thoſe barbarous Indians (both men, women
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112550:13"/>
and children) being then at war with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who took ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> children (out of families of good note) as Captives, and keep and train them up amongſt themſelves unto this day, having moſt barbarouſly and cruelly ſlain their Parents, who had been not a little carefull to train them up in their life time, both in faith and manners. But we removing ourſelves, as aboveſaid, into another part of the <hi>Nanhyganſet</hi> Bay, further from the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> and where none of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor other Nations had any thing to do, but only Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the true natives, of whom we bought a parcell of land called <hi>Shaw-omet</hi> (as is aboveſaid) not only of <hi>Myantonomy,</hi> chiefe Sachim, or prince of thoſe parts of the Country; but alſo with the free conſent of the Inhabitants of the place.</p>
            <p>Now we plainly perceiving that the drift of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> and thoſe joyned with them, was not only to take the whole Country of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations into their Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but alſo to eſtabliſh what way of Religion themſelves thought fit, to the the taking away (not only of goods) but lives alſo of ſuch as were otherwiſe minded: We made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto the Writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had ſent unto us, on this wiſe; which Anſwer was made upon our removall from <hi>Moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhawſet</hi> (otherwiſe called PROVIDENCE) to <hi>Shaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omet.</hi>

            <p>The words are theſe.</p>
            <q>Then Ieſus ſaid unto them, verily, verily, I ſay unto you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his blood, ye have no life in you.</q>

the ſentence it ſelfe, excluding all from the life of God, ſuch only excepted <hi>as doe eat the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, which is the occaſion of this divine ſentence; that is, the reaſonings within themſelves, which the Jewes had in the operations of their naturall hearts, upon the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this manner of doctrine unto them, <hi>even by the ſonne of God himſelfe,</hi> implyed in this word (<hi>Then</hi>) looking back upon the verſe immediatly going before, from which Chriſt takes occaſion to utter this ſentence; whence we obſerve, <hi>That the word of God takes occaſion, to utter and make it ſelfe manifeſt, even from the naturall reaſonings, and argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons framed in mens minds;</hi> though they are not the cauſe, yet they are the occaſion of the manifeſtation of it, even <hi>as the truth, righteouſneſſe, power, and authority that is in God,</hi> breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth occaſionally, <hi>feare, terrour, jealouſie, and wrath, in mens hearts and minds,</hi> though theſe excellencies that are in God, are no proper cauſe hereof, but onely an occaſion, without which they would not be; For <hi>if there were no Iudge, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor would not have terrour;</hi> even ſo, the very naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of mens hearts, are the occaſions of the manifeſtation of the word of God in us, but no proper cauſe of it, for the cauſe is only in God himſelfe; but without ſuch reaſonings, and <hi>Characteriſticall impreſſions in mans mind,</hi> the word of God could never have been <hi>implanted, written, or tranſlated in us whereby we come to have the argumentations, and concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſonnes of God, and not ſimply, or meerly of creatures in our minds,</hi> being once inlightned by him <hi>who is God, and the Father of lights, where ever it appeareth:</hi> So that the ſoule of man is of farre greater ſublimitie, and naturall excellencie in its creation, then any other creature under heaven ever had vouchſafed unto it; <hi>So that there is an utter impoſſibility that any creature ſhould receive the impreſſions of God, but man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a large field to walk in, for according to the variety of the reaſonings of the mind of man by nature, which is ſet forth in all thoſe wayes, wherein men have walked, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted

themſelves in this preſent world, <hi>ſuch it that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Epiſtle of Ieſus Chriſt, in the various writing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it in the ſouls, hearts, and lives of the Saints that are in light through Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> inſtance in one for all, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a naturall father reaſons thus, <hi>if my child ask bread</hi> (to ſupply nature in the ſuppreſſing of hunger) <hi>I cannot put a ſtone into his mouth, (that were cruelty)</hi> but bread; if ſo be that I have it or can procure it; <hi>if the child ack fiſh,</hi> the father cannot put <hi>a ſerpent into his boſome</hi> to bide and ſting him, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to cure and refreſh him, if he have it. Now do but change this argument into the way of Chriſt, <hi>and let God be the father, and my ſelf the child,</hi> and then is God, not man, the father; the bread heavenly and not from the earth; the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, reaſoning or argument, divine and eternall, not humane and temporary; and ſo the reaſnings and dictates of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are tranſlated into <hi>the arguments and dictates of the Spirit of God,</hi> and the arguments and dictates of the Spirit of God are tranſlated <hi>into a mind and ſpirit that ſpeaks the very ſame things naturally in it ſelf,</hi> though onely in a way of death, through its naturall ignorance, <hi>that now it ſpeaketh in that way of life, through that light and knowledge that is in the Lord;</hi> and thus, <hi>Chriſt by ſinne condemnes ſin in the fleſh:</hi> for by thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings wherewith we juſtifie our ſelves naturally, <hi>through that ignorance that naturally is in us,</hi> by the very ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reaſonings we condemn our ſelves, and juſtifie the Lord, <hi>through that light and knowledge we have in him by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The ſecond thing to be obſerved, is the certainty of this ſentence laid down in the form o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an oath, <hi>verily, verily,</hi> that is, <hi>ſo it is</hi> or <hi>ſo it ſhall be,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay <hi>Amen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> ſo it is and ſo it ſhall be <hi>without alteration or change,</hi> and in that the word is doubled, it is for the certainty of the thing, <hi>as Ioſeph ſaid of Pharaohs dreame,</hi> and of no leſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is all true expoſition and interpretation of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whatever men may dream as <hi>Pharaoh did and knew not the meaning of it,</hi> and ſpeak at uncertainties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved whether things may come to paſſe now or then, or fall out
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:112550:61"/>
to be thus, or ſo in the things of God; for the ſame ſpirit of truth and certainty, that gives the Propheſie, Proverbe, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and adviſe, that records the Hiſtory, or gives ſentence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, muſt alſo interpret, expound, and declare the meaning thereof; elſe is the Booke ſhut and ſealed up unto us; great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore to conclude of certaintie of Scripture, and of no infallibility in the interpretation thereof; For no more then we know the truth of an interpretation, no more doe we know the truth and certainty of any Hiſtory, Propheſie, Proverbe, or Parable, which is propounded unto us, but take things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The third thing, is the manner of pronunciation of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>I ſay (in) you;</hi> the word uſed here, tranſlated <hi>(I ſay)</hi> ſignifies ſuch a ſaying <hi>as a Iudge ſpeaks upon the Bench, when he gives ſentence in a cauſe, upon due proofe and evidence, which ſtands faſt in Law, being irrevocable;</hi> ſuch is the ſaying and ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>the truth whereof can never be altered;</hi> and whereas he ſaith, <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> or as the word is, <hi>I ſay (in) you,</hi> it ſignifies that what ever the Saints utter in point of Religion, it is, and muſt be, the voice of the Sonne of God, and not of themſelves; ſo that as he ſuffereth in them, elſe can hee have no death at all, and then no Saviour; even ſo he ſpeaks in them, or elſe hath no voice, nor language at all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without them, no Revealer of the will of his Father; for where Chriſt is ſilent, there can be no Revelation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he the word, or expreſſion of the Father; and what he ſaith of him, he ſaith it in them: therefore he ſaith, <hi>I ſay in you,</hi> as in that very Epiſtle, or writing, <hi>wherein I expreſſe my ſelfe in the Father unto the world, for my Father and I are one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be obſerved, is the ſentence it ſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all from the life of God, ſuch only excepted <hi>at doe eat the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke his blood;</hi> wherein obſerve five things briefly, firſt why he is called <hi>the Sonne</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
