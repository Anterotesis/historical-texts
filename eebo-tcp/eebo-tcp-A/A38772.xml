            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A brief <hi>DISCOVERY</hi> of Gods Eternal Truth.</head>
            <p>THus saith the Lord, <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Christ, depart from Iniquity:</hi> for the day cometh, and now is, that the Name of Christ will be dreadful and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to all workers of iniquity; and God the Father hath committed all Power in Heaven and in Earth, and Seas also, to his Son <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and hath raised him in Power and great Glory in thousands of his Saints, to convince the world of <hi>Sin,</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that the Prince of this World may be judged, and cast out; for he shall never have any part or portion with the Heir of Eternal Life and Salvation; who hath Power to judge and to justifie; and to condemn, or to save; to scatter, and to gather; to break to pieces, and to bind up that which is broken to pieces: and he will establish his own Spiritual Government, Righteous Rule, and Pure, Holy Worship, to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98080:3"/>
ends of the Earth; and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it: for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath purposed, shall surely come to pass, and his Decree shal stand; and <hi>Wo, wo, wo to every one that doth lift up a hand against any of those that the Lord God doth send forth in his Name, in this the Day of his Power, to preach Glad-tydings to the meek; or do form any carnal weapon against him in his Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinking to disinherite him, who is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed Heir of all:</hi> But the time doth hasten that the Lord God of Power will exalt his Princely Scepter, over <hi>all</hi> Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Thrones and Dominions, Kingdoms and Countries, and none shall be able to prevent him, or resist his mighty Power.</p>
            <p>Hear ye this, O all ye People upon the face of the Earth, who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> or do call your selves by Christ's <hi>Name,</hi> both Kings and Princes, Emperors, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and mighty men of the Earth, by what name or title soever ye are called, high or low, rich or poor; for our God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter of persons; but every one that feareth his Name, and worketh Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is accepted of him: Wherefore it chiefly behoveth every one of you to turn your minds <hi>within</hi> to the Light in your Consciences that convinceth of all Sin, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98080:3"/>
makes manifest every evil deed, be it done never so secret, the Light will discover it; It is a measure of God's free Grace given to every one to profit themselves withal; and search, examine, and duely consider how you come to have right or title to Christ's Name; or, what it is that maketh a <hi>Christian;</hi> for every true Christian is an Heir of God, and Joynt-heir with Christ: <hi>For as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, so in</hi> Christ <hi>shall all be made alive.</hi> Now you know that God created <hi>Adam</hi> at the first in a <hi>pure, perfect state of Innocency,</hi> his mind and soul in his <hi>own Image</hi> and <hi>likeness,</hi> which was Light and Life, and placed him in the Garden of <hi>Paradise,</hi> a place of eternal blessedness to all that do obey the Light; and God gave <hi>Adam</hi> dominion over all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that God created for the use of man, and blessed them unto him in that state of Innocency, and bid him eat of the fruit of every tree of the Garden; but the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that was good too, but not for food: And the Lord said unto <hi>Adam, Thou shalt not eat of the fruit of that tree; for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye. Adam</hi> did not stand in the Counsel of the Lord, but turned from the Light, and hearkened
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98080:4"/>
to the Woman whom the Serpent beguiled, and did eat of the <hi>forbidden Fruit,</hi> and so disobeyed the Commandment of the Lord God, and fell from that state of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, into that state wherein all things are an utter curse unto him, and unto all in that state of disobedience eternally: but the just, and wise, and holy Lord God, whose mercies are above all his works, did promise that <hi>the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents head.</hi> There are but two seeds, the Seed of the <hi>Woman,</hi> and the seed of the <hi>Serpent.</hi> Now this was the way which the pure and wise and perfect Lord God did find out in himself to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Man out of the Fall again, through the everlasting Covenant of the <hi>promised Seed</hi> of all blessedness. The Promise of God was not unto <hi>seeds,</hi> as to many; but unto [<hi>the</hi>] <hi>Seed,</hi> as unto one; <hi>In Isaac shall all the Kindreds of the Earth be blessed.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God, which cannot fail, was only to the Seed of <hi>faithful Abraham.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If ye are Christs, then are ye A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams seed, and heirs to the Promise:</hi> Wherefore every one of you in <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> may do well to turn in your minds to the Light of God in your own Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and try your selves, and see whether
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98080:4"/>
you have received the true righteous Seed, or are born of the pure and perfect Spirit of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> yea or nay; the Light will not deceive you, but deal plainly with you, and make manifest unto you all that ever was, or is <hi>within</hi> you; And he that is in Christ, hath the witness in himself, so that he need not go forth to seek after him, or to ask the way to <hi>Sion:</hi> for, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Light,</hi> saith Christ, and <hi>he that followeth me, shall not abide in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but have the Light of Life;</hi> and, <hi>He that hath not the Witness in himself, is in darkness, and hath not received the Light of Life, the Spirit of Christ;</hi> and, <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his.</hi> Then what profit hath anyone to have the Name of Christ, and out of his Nature?</p>
            <p>The Nature of Christ is altogether <hi>pure, perfect, holy,</hi> and <hi>upright; meek, humble, sober, loving, merciful, tender-hearted, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in all good; long-suffering,</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive,</hi> and <hi>willing to bear the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of sinners</hi> and the <hi>rebukes of the vile sons of men;</hi> and did lay down his Life for to save them that hated him, and were and are Enemies to his Cross: And all that are in Christ, <hi>ought themselves to walk as he walked,</hi> or else how should they be known
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98080:5"/>
to be born of the true Seed of God; for where the Seed of the Kingdom is sown, and received into good ground, in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest heart, it taketh deep root, and bringeth forth fruit answerable to the Seed, in some thirty, in some sixty, and in some an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold, that God may be glorified: for <hi>herein is my Father glorified, that ye bring forth much fruit,</hi> saith Christ, speaking to them that were called by his Name, and were his Disciples indeed, and did hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his Teaching, did hear his Voice, and follow him, and a stranger they would not hear; but Christ alone was their Head, Guide, Teacher, Leader, and they did believe in his Name, and obeyed his Will: <hi>For it is not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall be saved; but he that doth the Will of the Father is accepted. And this is the Will of God, that ye should believe in Him whom he hath sent, and be sanctified:</hi> for Christ is the same that ever he was to all that believe in his Name; He is their King, to rule; and Prophet, to teach; and Priest, to offer up the spiritual Sacrifices that are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Father, who saith, <hi>Let every one that nameth the Name of Christ depart from iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for, <hi>I have given him a Name, above every name, that at the Name</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98080:5"/>
               <hi>of IESUS every knee shall bow.</hi> He that doth depart from iniquity, doth bow at the Name of <hi>Jesus:</hi> but those that do bow their knees when they hear <hi>Jesus</hi> named, and do not depart from iniquity, do not bow at the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> but are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and do bow to the Beast, and do not believe in Christ Jesus, neither doth their faith stand in the power of God, but their faith is vain. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle of Jesus Christ, saith, <hi>He that believes in the Lord Iesus in his heart, and confesseth with his mouth that God hath raised him from the dead, shall be saved: for with the heart man believeth unto Righteousness, and with the mouth Confession is made unto Salvation:</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> did not say, <hi>that every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that Christ was crucified at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and God raised him up again, should be saved:</hi> No, that would contradict the Scriptures; for, <hi>as I live,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>if Israel were as the sands upon the Sea-shoar for multitude, but a remnant shall be saved: For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel;</hi> [but he is <hi>an Israelite indeed, in whose mouth there is no guile</hi>] but every one that confesseth the same Christ near them which was crucified at <hi>Jerusalem: For know ye not that Christ is in you, unless you are Rebrobates:</hi> And let
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98080:6"/>
them know, that do not witness the Life of Christ raised within them, that sin and wickedness is alive in them; and where sin and wickedness liveth, there Christ lieth crucified in the streets, that are spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually called <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> and it is the faith of the Drunkard, Swearer, Lyar, Murderer, Adulterer and covetous persons, and them that work all manner of Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which shall never enter into the Kingdom of God, as saith the Scriptures; yet those will confess that Christ dyed at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to their own condemnation, because they do not walk in obedience to him. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>Try the spirits whether they be of God, yea or nay. Every one that confesseth that Christ is come in the flesh, is born of God; but he that denieth Christ to be come in the flesh, is not born of God, but is of Antichrist, and denieth the Lord that bought him:</hi> He that professeth Christ, and doth not possess Christ, neither is possest of Christ, it is he that is <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and is not of Christ; but where Christ is manifested in the flesh, he destroyes the work of the Devil, and giveth power over Sin, Death, Hell and the Grave, and over Antichrist, and all the dark powers that do corrupt the Earth. Where sin is destroyed, death hath
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98080:6"/>
no power: <hi>The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal Life:</hi> And, <hi>he that hath the Son, hath Life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life, but is in Death, and the Wrath of God abideth upon him.</hi> He is the best Christian that is most like Christ. In him was no nature of cruelty at all, but full of love, mercy, and tender compassion, ready to forgive, and willing to receive all that come unto him, having nothing of their own, he will in no wise cast out: and he doth exhort all men to do to others, as they would have others do unto them; and commanded his Disciples to love one another, and to love enemies; and to do good to them that hate them, and despite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully use them. <hi>God is Love;</hi> and he that is born of God, doth love every one, and cannot use cruelty to any: but he that is not born of God, committeth sin; and he that committeth, is of the Devil, and dwelleth in the dark, where all sin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but he that dwelleth in the Light, dwelleth in the habitation of God, where no sin is committed, nor transgression found; and he that doth not know the Light in the Conscience, that convinceth of all sin, doth not know God: for God is <hi>Light,</hi> and Jesus Christ is the <hi>express Image</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98080:7"/>
of his Fathers Brightness, and eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Light, Life and Power; who is immortal, invisible, incomprehensible, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together pure, and perfectly holy and wise, and is throughly glorious beyond all that ever can be thought or spoken of him by all mankind; and he is risen with healing in his wings, and is not vailed, as in times past but is clearly seen, heard, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of all them that have received him, and lovingly imbraced him in the Truth; they in whom the eye of Innocency is opened by the mighty Power of God, they do see him, and enjoy him, and can and do bear witness of him, as <hi>Paul</hi> did; <hi>Christ the same yesterday, and to day,</hi> and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>for ever. Paul</hi> did not know him till he was risen from the dead, and ascended to the Father, as the Scriptures bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Persecutor after Christ was crucified, and he held the clothes of the witnesses that stoned <hi>Stephen,</hi> a man full of the holy Ghost, because he said, <hi>The Most High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, neither was he worshipped with mens hands.</hi> No, <hi>Stephen</hi> did know that his body was the Temple of the living God: and God is a Spirit, &amp; he is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped no otherwise acceptably, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

and in Truth; and <hi>Paul</hi> was consenting to his death; and after he was journeying from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Damascus,</hi> with Letters from the high Priests and Scribes, to hale men and women out of the Synagogues that did speak in the Name of Jesus, and to bring them bound to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> But in the mid way there was a Light met <hi>Paul</hi> and smote him, so that he fell to the ground, and <hi>Paul</hi> saw a Light shine round about him, but he saw no man; and he heard a Voice, saying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutest thou me? Who art thou, Lord,</hi> said <hi>Saul? I am Iesus, whom thou persecutest,</hi> said Christ the Light; <hi>it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks:</hi> and then <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out saying, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And as soon as the Lord revealed his Son Christ Jesus in him by his own immediate Spirit, he did not confer with flesh and blood, but went and preach'd him: <hi>Paul</hi> did profess Christ before, and did profit more in the Jewish Religion than many of his equals, but he did not know him, and so he persecuted him in his Saints, as thousands do at this day, and yet they will be called Christians.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> had received Christ Jesus the Spirit of Truth, he denyed himself, and

became a true Christian, through the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit of Christ and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth, and took up the Cross to his own will daily, and followed Christ the Light, through great tribulations, in newness of life; for as he did partake of the fellowship of his Death and Sufferings, so likewise he did partake of the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of his powerful Resurrection and his Glory. <hi>I am the Resurrection, and the Life,</hi> saith Christ. And not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one also in whom Christ is risen, do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the same Sufferings, and the same Joy, according to the measure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Faith of God's free Grace dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed to each one, by his own Eternal Spirit. And this is the way, and the alone way which God hath ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to make Christians; or, as I may safely say, to recover lost men out of the fall, and to redeem their souls and minds from all inward pollution and defilement, and wholly to ransom them out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward invisible transgression and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so to raise up the blessed Seed of his own tender bowels, and restore his pure Image, that hath been so long defaced through the subtilty of the Serpent, and regain his Glory, Honour and Renown
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98080:8"/>
among the sons and daughters of men, and will have the preheminency over all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the face of the Earth, in the measure of himself, in the Consciences of all, either in their eternal Salvation, or their just and everlasting Condemnation: for God hath not left himself without a Witness in every ones Conscience, and a measure of the free Grace of him, who is the Fulness: For the natural man cannot receive the gift of the Spirit, but as the Apostle said, <hi>And we saw his Glory, as the Glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Might. And of his Fulness have we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that the True and Living God, who respecteth no mans person, hath given to every one a Talent to improve, and a measure of Light, and also hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that this <hi>Everlasting Gospel</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> should be preached to <hi>every Creature,</hi> that they may receive <hi>grace for grace,</hi> that do believe in his Name: And they that do not beleive nor receive him, who doth tender salvation to them, the Light of God, which God gave them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, will eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, and leave them without any excuse in the presence of the Lord God,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98080:9"/>
because of their disobedience and resisting the gift of the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>There is <hi>something</hi> of God in every one, that would receive Gods truth if it should; but all that is not of God in every one doth strive and fight against it, and doth perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and imprison till death Gods Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which he hath endued with power from on high, and hath given them gifts and graces, and spiritual mercies of divine vertue, to preach to the Poor and to the captives, to the exiled and banished, and to sow the seed of Righteousness, that God might receive the fruits of holiness among his People. <hi>They that sow to the flesh, do of the flesh reap corruption; but they that sow to the Spirit, do of the Spirit reap Life everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that have not received the Spirit, they cannot sow to the Spirit; but they that have rceived, they sow to the Spirit, and do profit the people, where they come to be received, and they do bring forth fruits of God-like lives, and righteous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, and heavenly behaviour, and their fruits do manifest what ministry they are under; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>You are our Epistles written in our hearts, seen and read of all men.</hi> A pure life and a holy conversation
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98080:9"/>
is a sure evidence of a true Christian, and a perfect witness that they have received the Spirit of Christ, which maketh a Christian, and generateth into his body; <hi>Christ the Head, and Christians the Members;</hi> and he will not have any deformed member in his body, but they must be all compleat in Christ, <hi>Pure, as he is Pure; Holy, as he is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Undefiled, as he is Undefiled:</hi> even so as he is, so must his be in this present world; <hi>He that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are all one,</hi> as saith the Scriptures: But I say, in the Name and Power of the pure and perfect Lord God, <hi>That whosoever, or whatsoever he is in this world that taketh upon himself, or goeth about to make Christians, or convert Souls any other way, than by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the immediate Word of God as he doth receive it by the Inspiration of the eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life and Power, he is in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Presumption, and guilty of the great Transgression, and shall assuredly receive the greatest Condemnation from the Lord God of Power, if they or he do not speedily repent and forsake those great Abominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Me thinks, that every rational and sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded Man, must needs rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that God Almighty, who created all them, at the beginning, in Heaven
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98080:10"/>
Earth, and Sea, without the help or advice of any, and doth uphold the Works of his own Creation by the Word of his Power; and as he created the Souls and Minds of men in a pure State of Innocency, from whence man fell through Disobedience.</p>
            <p>So he it is alone, that can, and will, and doth quicken the Souls of men and women again, and create them anew, in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the Lord from heaven, the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> a quickening Spirit, the <hi>Immanuel</hi> of Eternal Life, of the Word of his Power; and need not the Assistance or Counsel of any besides himself, to raise up Souls to life and immortality; for our God is an invisible, eternal, and immortal Spirit, perfect, holy, wise and powerful: and every reasonable man must needs know, and believe, That there is not any thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Spirit, that can so much as touch a Soul as to cleanse it, or to defile it; so it is the unrighteous spirit of Darkness, the Prince of the Power of the Air, that doth rule in the Children of Disobedience, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteth the Souls, and defileth the whole Minds, and causeth them to yield up the fleshly Members, to commit sins of all kinds, in Thought, Word and Action; and so the Springs of Life and Salvation are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98080:10"/>
dammed up, and the pure Spirit of the Lord is covered, and the Eye of Innocency blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so that man cannot behold his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, because Sin hath made a separation, as saith the Prophet, <hi>Behold the Lord's hand is not shortned, that it cannot save; neither is his eare heavy, that he cannot hear; but it is your iniquities that have separated between you and your God, and your sins have caused his face to be hid from you:</hi> And as it is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit that doth defile and pollute the Mind and Soul, and corrupt the Heart of man; hence it is that nothing but the clean and pure Spirit of the Lord God, that can in any wise cleanse and sanctifie the Soul and Mind, or purge, or purifie the Heart again: and it seems to be a very vain thing for any man or woman to think otherwise. Now let every one that is called a Minister of Jesus Christ, see that he be so indeed and in truth; for they must come a great way before they can administer Christ: Wherefore it is safe to consider, that Death reigned, or reigneth, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and from <hi>Moses</hi> till the Prophet <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> was a burning &amp; a shining Light, the greatest that was born among women; <hi>but the least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he:</hi> and <hi>John</hi> cried in the Wilderness,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98080:11"/>
saying, <hi>Prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make his Paths streight;</hi> for he, whose shooe he was not worthy to unloose, was coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and gather the Wheat into the Garner; but the Chaff he will burn with Fire unquenchable.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> denied not, and said, <hi>He was not that Light, but he came to bear witness of the Light,</hi> saying, <hi>This is the true Light, that lighteth every one that cometh into the world.</hi> Now it behoveth all that are called Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, to call themselves to mind how they travelled through all these Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations, spiritually, from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> ye are all in death; and when you have received the just and holy Law of <hi>Moses</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> then you must journey through all the Prophesies, till you come to <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the City of the living God, before you can be a noble Minister of Jesus Christ: And this I am bold to declare in the Name of the Lord Jesus, whose Servant I am through mercy. Be ye not deceived, the Lord God will not be mocked any longer; there is a great Mystery in Godliness, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that all the earthly Wisdom, and Learning, and Languages, Studies or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98080:11"/>
is never able to fathom or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the least Motion of the Life of it; but as the Mind is joyned to the Light, the Word of Life, the Word that was before the World was, the Word by which the World was made, the Word that is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged Sword, even to the piercing and dividing between soul and spirit, joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a searcher and discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of every ones heart; and this is he, whose Vesture is dipt in Blood; his Name is called the Word of God, and he is come according to the, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Counsel of the Father, to make a separation between the Pretious and the Vile, and to divide the Sheep from the Goats, and to gather in the Flock of his Inheritance, the People of his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, the Sheep of his hands, to fill up his own Fold, out of every Kindred, Tongue and Nation, <hi>Jew and Gentile,</hi> Bond or Free, of his Israelites indeed, in whose mouths there is no guile; and he will place his Name amongst them again, and work his Fear in their hearts, and write his Laws in their inward-parts, that they may never depart from it; and they shall be his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ever, and he will be their God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98080:12"/>
and he will be merciful to their Transgressions; their Sins and Iniquities he will remember no more; for our God cannot deny himself, nor forget his holy Promises, who hath said, <hi>I have given Him for a Covenant of Light, to enlighten the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and a Leader, and Commander to the people:</hi> and the day is come, that all the Children of the Lord shall be taught of the Lord, and be established in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. And as for those Ministers that say, Men and women can never be freed from Sin, while they are here, nor made perfect while they are in the body; I say, such Ministers do not know Christ Jesus the Light, nor his Ministry, which saith, <hi>When he ascended up on High, he led Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive, &amp; gave gifts unto men; some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, some Apostles, some Ministers, for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the Work of the Ministry, and for the edifying of the whole body of the Church.</hi> And again it is said, <hi>All Scripture given by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, is wholsome for Doctrine, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, for Reproof, and Correction in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that the man of God may be made perfect, and thorowly furnished to every good Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let all sober-minded men, consider
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98080:12"/>
where men and women should be made perfect, if not here, while they are in this body; If not in this Body, where then? <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>As the tree falleth so it lieth;</hi> &amp; the Spirit of the Lord doth not once men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any other place to be purged in, in all the Scriptures of truth. And the Prophet spake to the Church, and said, <hi>The Lord would purely purge away the dross, and take away the tin, and rebrobate silver and gold.</hi> And this I know, when Souls come to be quickned by the powerful Word of Life and Truth, they come to know the Purgings of the Father, and the Washing in the Fountain of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cleansings, in the sweet Streams of Light and living Refreshment; the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Refining in the Sanctifying-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of the Spirit of the Lord God; and so they do come to be cleansed, purified, and sanctified throughout souls, bodies and Spirits, and are made Vessels of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and fitted for Glory, without the help of any Man, or any outward Observation whatsoever. What is to be known of God is manifested <hi>within;</hi> and He that giveth pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over any ones sin, is sufficient to give power over all sins; and will, and doth, to all that be obedient: <hi>The willing and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient shall eat the Good of the Land; but they</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98080:13"/>
               <hi>that refuse and rebel, the Sword shall devour them; the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and his zeal will perform it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is none can forgive Sins but God only; against whom all sin is committed; for whatsoever just offence is given to any, he that giveth the offence, sinneth against the Commandment of God, which saith, <hi>Do by all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you would have them do unto you, and love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> He never commanded any to do contrary to his own nature, which is, <hi>Love, Mercy, and Long suffering,</hi> waiting to be gracious; <hi>not willing the death of any, but that all should return and forsake the Evil of their Wayes, and deny the Evil of their Doings,</hi> and then he would have mercy upon them, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon all such as come to him in the Name of the Lord Jesus, bringing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with them but <hi>a penitent heart, and an humble spirit, confessing their sins,</hi> being weary of the burthen and weight of them; and he will forgive and take away the Guilt from the Conscience: while there is guilt within, the sin is not pardoned; when the Sin and the Guilt of Sin is taken away, then there is no Condemnation, but man is at unity with his Maker, &amp; all Fear of Death and Torment is taken away; <hi>for the Sting</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98080:13"/>
               <hi>of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law; but thanks be to God, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the victory, through our Lord Iesus Christ, over Sin, Death, Hell and the Grave, together with all the dark Powers of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That as we, who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do continue in the <hi>Light,</hi> none can overcome us; for Truth is stronger than all; and the Lord our God will exalt his Truth over all Falshood and deceivable Shews: Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Praises, eternal Glory, and heavenly Renown to his pure, holy and perfect Name for ever, world without end, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is none can forgive Sins but God only, neither will he give his Honour to another; though Christ said to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>Whose Sins ye remit on Earth, shall be remitted in Heaven;</hi> he spake to them that were filled with his own eternal Spirit, and were able to discern an innocent penitent Heart, from a Hypocrite, in the Light and Life of Righteousness: and they did not say, they could forgive any their Sins, but they were sent to direct their Minds to God, who was, and is ready to forgive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that cometh to him by Faith, and throughly purged and cleansed from all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. But as for those that have taken
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98080:14"/>
upon them to pardon Creatures for their Money, or if they will receive their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and so deceive the poor People; and so he or they that doth pardon, and they that are pardoned of them, do, and will perish together eternally, unless they repent of their Blasphemies and Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Divinations, Inchantments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the poor People are blinded and kept in ignorance, and in all manner of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and are corrupted for want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: <hi>My People perish for want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> (saith God) <hi>and the Kingdom is shut up from the Simple-hearted; and the Key of Knowledge is hid away by them that will not enter in themselves, nor suffer any to enter that would;</hi> neither will they permit, that any of the Lord's Anointed, that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Key of Knowledge, should speak among the People; but they say, None ought to speak in the Name of Jesus, but the divine Doctors that have received their Ordinations from them. The People are blind indeed that do think the Spirit of the Lord can be limitted, tyed, confined, or dispenced by any mortal Man; No, they that do make the people believe any such thing, are absolutely the Messengers of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and not the Ministers of Christ; they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98080:14"/>
are out of his Doctrine: such are Doctors of Divinity that dwell in the Divine Light of God, and grow into his Divine Nature, and do receive their Ministry by the Inspiration of his divine Spirit of Life and Power, and do speak as they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and as the Spirit giveth them utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Will of God; they are no Men-pleasers, nor Time-servers, nor Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worshippers; for such cannot please God that seek to please man: and they are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, that walk in the Imitations and Likenesses without the Life and Power, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving this thing, and observing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Christ saith, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven cometh not with Observations; but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within you;</hi> speaking to the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees, Wise</hi> and <hi>Learned,</hi> that were gone out from the Kingdom, the Measure of God in them, in which is Power to destroy the Works of the Devil in the Observations; and Christ reproved them, and said to them, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven consists in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Peace and Ioy in the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that is the kingdom of Antichrist, in which kingdom is the City that <hi>Cain</hi> built, that is in the Observations: and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>

that <hi>Nimrod</hi> the <hi>Heretick</hi> begun to build, which is full of confused Noises, and Bloodshed, and all manner of Cruelty: <hi>It is Babel that is built with blood; but Sion is redeemed through judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</hi> O! blessed be the pure, holy, and powerful Lord God, the Day of his Power, according to his determinate Counsel, is come, that Antichrists King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom shall be destroyed; and <hi>Babels</hi> Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding must fall: for the Mystery of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth, is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by the bright Appearing of the Lord Jesus; and the Children of Light are able to fathom and comprehend her and all her Lovers, and to see the Foundation they stand on, and the Ground they act from, which is but as Water, (as <hi>John</hi> saith in his <hi>Revelations,</hi> he saw Nations Waters, Peoples Waters, and Tongues Waters, yea, Men Waters; Peoples and Nations all unstabled like the Waves of the Sea, tossed to and fro with every Wind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the changable; gone out from that which changeth not, into the many Ways, and have heaped to themselves Teachers having itching eares, and cannot endure sound Doctrine, but saith, Preach unto us

smooth things; so they do preach Peace where the Lord proclaimeth War; and bless themselves in that nature, that is everlastingly shut out of the Kingdom of God, and excluded from his living Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: But the Lord God of Life and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will, &amp; hath discovered the Spirit of the Barren woman, that hath made all Nations drunken with the Wine of her Fornication, and the Inhabitants of the Earth were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited and overcome with her Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: She shall soon be cast into a Bed of Torment with all her Lovers, where she shall have Torment without Ease; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Mercy; a full Cup without Mixture, and the Dregs wrung out unto her, and she shallbe rewarded double for all her Iniqiuties; the Lord will mar her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and stain her glory, and strip off her cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly robes, and lay her honour in the dust, and turn her songs into howling, and her mirth into mourning, and her musick into lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and she shall receive a Cup of trembling at the Lord's hand, and all her glory, pomp and pride shall perish as the untimely figs, and fade as the flower of the field, and wither as the grass upon the house top; and the Smoak of her torment shall ascend in the sight of all people, and

it shall go forth in the audience of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and she shall be a by-word, and a scorn, a taunt, hissing, and derision, and off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouring to as many as have heard of her Name; and a day of lamentation shall be heard in the midst of her great Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Wrath and Anguish, upon every Soul that doth Evil, because she repented not of her Uncleanness, Fornication, Cruelty, Hardheartedness and Mercilesness, and all her Uncharitableness, and Blasphemy, and Sorceries, and the like Wickedness.</p>
            <p>And this I give in my Testimony for the Lord in the living Word of Truth, against Her and all her Lovers, and every one that uphold Her, as I have received it by the Revelation of the Son of God, and not from, or of any Flesh or Blood, but have seen, handled and tasted deeply of the Cup of the Indignation of the Lords Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>If Iudgment first begin at the house of God, what will become of them that obey not the Gospel of God? for if the Righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the Wicked and Ungodly appear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for some help and light for the understanding of them that do not know the Mystery of Iniquity, and that spirit that doth generate it here, as aforesaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98080:16"/>
the spirit of Antichrist is that spirit in every one that doth profess Christ Jesus in words, but doth not possess him in life and power; and such are they that are making Images, and forms, and likenesses without, and call it by Christ's Name, and say it doth represent Christ; when none can make his Likeness, nor bear his Image, but those that are created anew in Christ Jesus, and born of the same Spirit.</p>
            <p>The righteous Image or Form of Christ, is the perfect Life of Innocency, and the pure Spirit of Meekness, and an upright heart of true Humility, as it is written, <hi>Upon whomsoever you shall see the Spirit of the Lord descend like a Dove, and abide upon him; this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi> You all know a Dove is an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent harmless creature, and so are all God's Children which are sanctified in the undefiled womb of God's second creation, where the first Heaven and the first Earth is passed away, and new Heavens and a new Earth are witnessed, wherein dwelleth Righteousness for evermore; and he that is called the <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> is the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> in every particular, that steals away the heart, and draws out the mind from the true invisible God, and sets it upon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

objects, and visible appearances: The glory of the world that doth fade and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away, as the smoak in the eye, and the painted harlot, is the fallen wisdom that is comprehended in the earthly mind, carnal understanding, and airy spirit, inventing and devising how to deck and beautifie her self with the glory of this world and outside shews, to get her self a name over all the Earth, and calls her self holy, pure and spiritual, that all people may fall down and worship her painted image, and so the wind of her spirit goeth forth, and overchargeth the hearts of the people, and corrupts them; and when the heart is corrupted it conceiveth lust, and when lust is conceived it bringeth forth sin, and when sin is finished it bringeth forth death; <hi>The wages of sin is death;</hi> and the Scarlet-coloured Beast that doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the adulterous woman, with all her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements upon whom she sits, is that beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like will of or in man, that is not subject to the Will of God, but hath received power to exalt his horn, even to the Host of Heaven, for the cleansing of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and purifying of the Temple, and for the tryal of the Faith of God's Elect, that the power of God may rest upon them, and

so they come to be approved in the sight of all: and herein our God is glorified, honoured and renowned, over all, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing to himself a <hi>holy Kingdom,</hi> through the blood of the <hi>everlasting Covenant</hi> in the <hi>faithful-hearted,</hi> that do follow the Lamb through great tribulations, according to the Scriptures. Every man out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God is bruitish, and that spirit which doth exalt it self over the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any people, to compel them by a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnnous Law, to worship according to his will, and in his way, without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment or Precept from the Lord, that is <hi>Lucifer,</hi> which the Lord God will cast down to the bottom of Infamy, and will do unto him, as he did to proud and lofty <hi>Haman,</hi> as the Spirit of the Lord hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested: for God and his Word are one, and his way to the Kingdom is but one, and he never compelled any with camal weapons, or any visible thing, to worship him.</p>

God that gave you Life, and obey his holy <hi>Gospel,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Conscience,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of all Sin, and judgeth the Secrets of every ones Heart. O hearken to the heavenly Voice of the true invisible God; he is near to every one to save or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: Yea, of a truth, he is risen in great Power to correct the Wayes of men throughout all Nations; whose Wayes have been their own Wayes for many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions past: but this is the Day in which the Lord God will restore Judges as at the first, and Counsellors as at the beginning: Wherefore let every one that hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Power and Authority from the Lord to rule and regulate amongst the People, take heed that they do not abuse the Power, the Lord hath committed into their hands as a Stewardship, whereof they must give an account before the High and Mighty Judge of Heaven and Earth, that sits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne to Judge the Nations in Righteousness, and the People with Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and he will smite the Earth with the Rod of his mouth, and consume the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the Breath of his lips; and the Lord God will remove, and overturn, and cut down, till he hath exalted men like to faithful <hi>Moses</hi> and righteous <hi>Samuel,</hi> to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98080:20"/>
do the work of Justice, Mercy and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to every one, without respect to Persons, in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, not seeking their own honour, and glory, but the Honour and Glory of the Lord God. And thus he will make you honourable in the sight of all men: for of a truth, they that exalt themselves shall be brought low; but they which the Lord doth exalt, none can cast down: and likewise see that you do nor judge others for that which your selves stand guilty of, or the like sin in the self-same nature; if so, wherein ye judge others, you condemn your selves, and your own Condemnation will stand over your own heads for ever.</p>
            <p>Wherefore take heed how you do mount in the Seat of Tribunal; and let every Thought, Word and Action, in your Sentences of Judgment of others, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Light</hi> of God in your own <hi>Consciences;</hi> which otherwise will be your eternal Condemnation without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, in the Presence of the Lord God Almighty; whose Voice doth shake terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Earth, and makes the Hearts of the <hi>Heathen</hi> to tremble; and doth, and will remove Mountains, and over-turn Hills; and take all that lets and stands in

opposition against his pure Truth; and the little Hill of <hi>Sion</hi> shall trample over all the Mountains to the Ends of the Earth: And who shall be able to resist it? no, no, not one: the Lord will rip up every false Covering, &amp; strip off every deceitful Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make manifest every seducing Spirit, and blind Guide, and false Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that doth work by signs and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with all manner of Deceivableness; and doth deceive the hearts of the Simple, and stealeth away their hearts, and draweth out their minds from the true invisible Lord God that made them, and doth set them upon earthly Objects, and visible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and the Glory of this life that will perish for ever, and vanish away like the smoak in the aire; and the invisible God they have no more knowledge of, than the beast that perisheth: and these be them that run, and the Lord never sent them, and saith, <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi> and the Lord hath not spoken unto them, neither did they ever see his face, nor hear his voice at any time; neither do they profit the people at all, but build them up in the Mystery of Iniquity, and teach them to wonder after the monstrous Beast, which hath many Heads, and many Horns, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98080:21"/>
Mouths full of Blasphemy, and Eyes full of Adultery, walking in the broad way that leads to the chambers of death and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to the Pit of everlasting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and shuts up the Kingdom from the Simple-hearted; and hides the Key of Knowledge from the innocent Ones; and will not enter in themselves, nor suffer them to enter that would: and these are them that feed of the Fat, and go on their Bellies all their life long; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents of the earth that suck the sweet up, the spirit of the earth; and they make the poor people believe it doth belong to them in Christ, because they must pray for them, to the saving of their Souls. O these be <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and they do not know the Price of the redemption of a Soul out of death; neither have they the Knowledge of God, nor his Way to Salvation; for if they did know the Lord, they would fear and dread his holy Name, and teach the People the Way to Life eternal, which is the <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Conscience</hi> in every one; and he that comes not to the <hi>Light,</hi> comes not into the Way of God which leads to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: The Kingdom of God is one, his Way is one, his Light is one, his Life is one, and his Spirit of Truth is one,

and his Word is one; and what he speaks once, he speaks still; and what he once condemns, he never justifies; and what he once justifies, he never condemns: He is God, and changeth not, but <hi>the same, yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to day, and so likewise for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now they that are in the changeable, and in the many wayes, are out of the Way of God, which is Light, and are in the dark, and do not see the way they walk in, neither do they know the Lord, nor his Word, that is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged Sword; for did they know that Word, they would not dare to mock and scorn at them that tremble at the Word, and meet together to wait upon the Lord in silence, and do hearken diligently to know the Mind of God, that they may not sin against him, nor act contrary to him; but those men or women cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern the Mind of God that are not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Christ Jesus, and the Body of sin &amp; death destroyed, which is a mystery to all the Wisdom &amp; Learning in the world, that do not own the Light in the Conscience to be their alone Teacher, but live in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient nature out from God and his Truth, in the earthly mind and carnal will, comprehending this thing and that

in the fallen wisdom, inventing, devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and imagining things that never were, nor is, nor never will be: So your Prophets, they prophesie lies, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and the People love to have it so; but what will they do in the end thereof, in the day when the Lord shall require the Talent that he gave to every one to profit withal?</p>
            <p>Now, where is the Talent with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement? is it not lost? is it not hid in the barren wilderness, and in the desolate places of the earth? Oh, try and examine search and consider, where is that good and faithful Servant, and just Steward, that hath improved his Talent for his Masters use, and is ready to give up his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with joy before the Tribunal of the Majesty of the Most High, having his Garment washed in the Blood of the Lamb, and his heart sprinkled from an evil Conscience, and the Body washed with pure water; I do not say nor mean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal water, to wash the out-side of the body, but I do mean the spiritual Water, that streams from the Fountain or Rock; Christ Jesus, to wash the inside, and to cleanse the Soul and Spirit from all Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Defilement: <hi>Ye wash the outside</hi>
