            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Another thing I haue much wondered at, wherefore diuers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing discourst so largely vpon the applying it to vlcers, burninges, wounds, &amp; such like, they haue not longer stayed vppon the reportes which they might make of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it in pipes, as we now vse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be for this, (and indeede I iudge it one of the chiefe causes) that time and experience, which both corrects old and brings forth new things, either had not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to those writers the maner of receiuing it as we now vse it, or if they did vse it, yet it had been so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time in practise, as they had not seene those conclusions wrought

wrought by it which we haue, and to say truth, who hath long known it an vsuall thing in this part of the world, to drinke <hi>Tabacco</hi>? and yet who is he that euer knew it longest and can iustly say, that this or that discommoditie is come to him by it, vnlesse drinking it extreamly, he hath changed the good into a bad effect, since euerie extreme vertue is a vice: and then who will either deeme <hi>Tabacco</hi> worse since he hath abused it, or not iudge him ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing so good a benefite, that knowes not how to make his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, hauing so easie a meanes as a moderate receipt.</p>
            <p>And by this meanes I doubt not but some hath both done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues wrong, wronged vs, and done other iniurie, who (if they had not heard of some whom vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respectiue drincking had harmed)

            <p>I haue found it very excellent and soueraigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beeing tired and weary with iournying too far, but in this the quantety works the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, for as a little causeth wakefulnesse, so it beeing taken ouermuch, as sixe or seauen pipes full, it will procure a most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found sleepe; and I haue found it taken away that wearisomnesse in one night, which I haue thought would not haue left me in many daies: and this I put in excecution, to try how that was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> true that a Spaniard writes of the Indians, who reporteth, that after their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and labours, they will drincke vnmeasurably of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> which (after they had slept) tooke away all wearinesse of body, and makes them as prompt and apt to busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25244:11"/>
as if they had been many daies without doing any thing, and surely I found it very neare the truth, for the next day, I did perceiue my wearinesse almost vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly gone, although not quite, which perhaps might be for want of custome, or because my sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before was apt to make me feele that longer than I should haue done beeing well.</p>
            <p>But that I may vse mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I will not confirme by any precise comparison, I thinke that those writers which haue so effectually written of the nature of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> by outward applications both knew the secreat effects of the greene leafe, applying it to wounds, and of the dried leafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it by pipes: but hearing of so strange a maner of receiuing it, as phisicke was neuer guilty to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25244:11"/>
vnderstanding of, they thought it meet to preserue in a perpetuall concealment among themselues, least being knowne to the world, the inhabilitie of other hearbs and deuises being discouered, and this made knowne, it might turne to the common detrement and hurt of their Art; for in reason, why should any man lay open willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or suffer another to enter into the secret conceipts and interne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our knowledge, when such internetie might make it either les prised, or cause a publique cause to receiue a generall disesteeme for a particular occasion. And I doubt not but if an idle <hi>Tabacconist,</hi> and a hot Phisition were met without a moderator, it would proue a hard question in their naturall reasons, whether hee that first deuised this secret of drinking <hi>Tabacco,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:25244:12"/>
being a phisition himselfe, (as sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well, be he what he will, or what he was, I doubt not but he did a more good deed than hee was aduised of, and therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues in mine opinion to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise requited than according to the quality of his deserts, which if it may be thought infinite in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of himselfe, then let not him want his due, for it were sin that since so few men deserue well, any of them should cease to good workes, because they want that

            <p>I could stand longer to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade the world of some wonders that I haue seen effected with one draught of excellent <hi>Tabacco,</hi> but some that are as hard of beleefe as he that persuaded himselfe a man could not breake his necke with a fall from Paules, if he fell vpon feather beds, I will omit to the oportunity of their owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I my selfe once trie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to conclude, I will limit no man to any prescript order of drinking <hi>Tabacco,</hi> nor wish that any should vse it, but as they finde themselues cold in their stomacke, rheumaticke, or hauing the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache, or for diuers other such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie occasions, for I see not how such vnmeasurable drinking should not both harme them that drink it, and wrong others by rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the world of so singular a treasure as this.

               <p>This hearbe in fourme much resembleth Consonde, and is of so neer a likenesse and resemblance, that you would iudge it to be the greater Consond.</p>

               <p>Some you shall haue growing very high, somtimes to the heigth of nine or ten foote, yea somtimes a cubit, but that fortunes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordering of it when it is sowne.</p>
               <p>The leaues somtimes grow halfe a foot distant the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it hath any great heigth.</p>
               <p>The floure of the <hi>Tabacco</hi> is much like the floure of Niel, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times yellow, and somtimes of a

               <p>And when it casteth the flower, it leaues the former proportion, and taketh the semblance of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in which you may finde the seeds inclosed very small, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not much vnlike to Iusquiasm seedes, which are yellowish: but when they grow to be toward their full ripenesse, then they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more neare to a blacke. In those regions from whence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued first the knowledge hereof, <hi>Tabacco</hi> hath both floure, seed, and leafe, at one instant, but the reason is, those countries of the Indians are better and apter to bring forth sooner such hot hearbes than a cold climate. In the nine or tenth month it springeth very much at the foot, for then is the roote fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the ground with a great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:25244:24"/>
sort of very weake strings.</p>
               <p>Who would make experiment of the greene leafe, to apply it to any vlcer, sore, or cut, shall in bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it finde a iuice thicke and slimie, but in the smell it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie well sauoring, although such as haue no vse of the smell would iudge it strong and noisom, in tast it is somewhat biting, it is drie in the first degree, and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer would haue it good, should doe wel to sow it in the hottest and most fertill ground, for such it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
               <p>The best place wherin it will most prosper and be naturally planted in our countries, is where the sunne shineth most, and if it be possible against some wall which may defend it from the North winde, which is an infinite enemy to this hearbe, and withall it were
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:25244:25"/>
conuenient that no winde at all, beeing ouer rigourous, should come neere it, for the weakenesse of the stalke caused by the high growth of the hearbe, is such, that a small winde will blow it downe, vnlesse happily it be deeply roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If the weather be ouer drie, it will desire much watering. Cold kils this, and therefore all means are to be vsed against it.</p>
               <p>Who would sow it, ought by the opinion of the best skild in Phisicke, to take this order, first take a dosen seeds of those which you finde inclosed in that part of the seede which resembleth the bell, and put them togither into one hole, about three inches deep in the ground, and the cause why you are to plant it deepe is because the seeds be very small and little, and might be choaked.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25244:25"/>
If the weather be ouer drie, you shall doe well to water it fifteene daies together. It may be sowne in manner like the hearbe <hi>Laistich,</hi> whose seeds are mingled with earth or sand.</p>
               <p>It will seeme long ere it appeare aboue ground, but that will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the ground, and yet euen then it will be longer than many other seedes, but immediatly as soone as you see it begin to spring, you shall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it as much as you can conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, least that frosts, or cold, or tempestious raine, nip it away, or wash it downe; and after conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time of growth, you shall take it vp by the roote, cutting vp the ground round about, so that there may none of the strings of the roote be broken, which to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, you may very wel wash away
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25244:26"/>
the earth with water, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant it again, neer some wal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two or three foot, but if the ground be not good there, (as commonly it may happen) then prepare with apte manuring it.</p>
               <p>For the time of sowing it in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land I agree rather with <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> than these two, who say it is best sowing it in the midst of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prill, but I would rather hold it better to sow it in March, for the same occasion that <hi>Monardes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, howbeit <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Liebault</hi> write that the Spaniards and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans sow it after haruest.</p>
               <p>It is hot and drie in the second degree, and therfore fit vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to purge and clense, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (they affirme) it hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> so named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it resembleth I thinke a curst shrew that must not be toucht

               <p>Who taketh the leaues and seeths them in water, and maketh thereof a sirupe with sugar, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth of it euerie morning to the quantitie of two ownces, shall

finde how much power it hath to dissolue grosse humors, to ease the hard drawing of the breath, breake an old cough or fleume, &amp; how it causeth dissolution of hard swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the body, if before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt heerof we receiue some vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall purge, and then the iuice of the leaues vnstop the kidney, and softneth the hardnesse by being onely applied vnto the region of the kidny: and in case we want of the leaues, the pouder mingled with any ointment proper to such an euill, is auailable. The same means auaileth in coldnesse of the stomacke, the bellie, the collique, and the inward partes, being appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Nauil.</p>
               <p>They affirme that in France a man hauing a sore vlcer, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stume, caused by the euil of naples, that we cal in English the French

               <p>It is a singular remedie against soundings, to receiue the smoke as we vse with pipes; &amp; that which is more strange than the world wold credit, the inhabitants of <hi>Florida</hi> often nourish themselues four or fiue daies together by the smoke, neither eating nor drinking any thing whatsoeuer, and this is most certainly confirmed by that which he writeth.</p>
               <p>More than this writeth <hi>Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bault,</hi> that there are which distill water of the green leaues of <hi>Tabac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> in a Limbecke of glasse, which water is no lesse singular in all ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, than the very iuice, helping all wounds, sores, and bruses, euen restoring to men which by some aduenture haue lost their nailes, new ones, by washing that part

with the water destilled, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wrapping them vp in fine linnen clothes, dipt in the water.</p>
               <p>Some there are also who (to speake like a Chimist) doe distill oyle of <hi>Tabacco, per descensum,</hi> which oile, these authors (agreing with the Paracelsians) preferre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other applications, either of leaues, iuice, or pouder, because the quintescences and extractions drawne out of the simples, are the subtill spirit, and haue the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vertue and facultie of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the which they are drawne.</p>
               <p>They prescribe vnto vs this kinde of receipt, Take of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest and most substantial leaues of this <hi>Tabacco</hi> one pound, beat them in a morter of Marble, after take halfe a pound of sweet hogs grease, refind and clarified, without salt,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:25244:28"/>
and this being melted, ad to it the <hi>Tabacco,</hi> and set it ouer a soft fire to seeth deliberatly, vntill such time as you finde the waterish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the <hi>Tabacco</hi> vapoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that the mingled sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances retaine the fourme of a perfect ointment, this reserue for a singular and medicinable good.</p>
               <p>Another is this, Take Rosel, new wax, and turpentine, of each three ounces, melt them togither, and then adde vnto them a pound of <hi>Tabacco</hi> prepared as before, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them togither, and after with a slow fire set them to incorporat, seething togither fiue or sixe howers, vntill the water of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> be cleane vapoured away, after this is done, straine it through a course linnen cloath, that may be very strong: afterward take halfe a pound of Venice Turpentine,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25244:29"/>
and infuse it into these thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, without any more boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, but stirring it continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vntill it be cold, afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue these as pretious ointments: touching their effects; the first of these two is the better for sores, vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, carbuncles, tetters, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, than the second, because <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> hath so much the more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by how much there are fewer commixions. The second is better than the first, to consolidate any wound, dissolue impostumes and swellings, &amp; to appease their rage.</p>
               <p>Further you may make a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Baulme, by cutting greene leaues of <hi>Tabacco</hi> and putting them into a glasse well stopt, if you set it a good time in hot water, or in the sunne, or buried in <hi>Ventre equino,</hi> by the space of fortie daies, and doubtlesse you shal finde so singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
