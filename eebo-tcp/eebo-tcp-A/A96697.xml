         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
New yeers Gift
SENT TO THE
PARLIAMENT
AND
ARMIE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen of the Parliament and Armie;
you and the Common people have aſſiſted
each other, to caſt out the Head of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
which was Kingly power, ſeated
in one mans hand, and that work is now
done, and till that work was done you
called upon the people to aſſiſt you to deliver this diſtreſſed
bleeding dying nation out of bondage; And the people
came and failed you not, counting neither purſe nor blood
too dear to part with to effect this work.</p>
            <p>The Parliament after this have made an Act to caſt out
Kingly power, and to make <hi>England</hi> a free Common-wealth.
Theſe Acts the People are much rejoyced with, as being
words forerunning their freedome, and they wait for their
accompliſhment that their joy may be full; for as words
without action are a cheat, and kills the comfort of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117691:3"/>
ſpirit, ſo words performed in action does comfort and
nouriſh the life thereof.</p>
            <p>Now Sirs, whereſoever we ſpie out Kingly power, no man
I hope ſhall be troubled to declare it, nor afraid to caſt it
out, having both Act of Parliament, the Souldiers Oath, and
the common peoples conſent on his ſide; for Kingly power
is like a great ſpread tree, if you lop the head or top-bow, and
let the other Branches and root ſtand, it will grow again
and recover freſher ſtrength.</p>
            <p>If any ask me, What Kingly power is? I Anſwer, there is
a twofold Kingly power. The one is, The Kingly power
of righteouſneſſe, and this is the power of Almightie God,
ruling the whole creation in peace, and keeping it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And this is the power of univerſall love, leading people
into all truth, teaching every one to doe as he would be
done unto. Now once more ſtriving with fleſh and blood,
ſhaking down every thing that cannot ſtand, and bringing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one into the Unitie of himſelf, the one Spirit of love
and righteouſneſſe, and ſo will work a through reſtauration.
But this Kingly power is above all, and will tread all covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
pride, envy, and ſelf-love, and all other enemies whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
under his feet, and take the kingdom and government of
the Creation out of the hand of ſelf-ſeeking and ſelf-honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fleſh, and rule the alone King of Righteouſneſs in the
earth; and this indeed is Chriſt himſelf, who will caſt out the
curſe; But this is not that Kingly power intended by that
Act of Parliament to be caſt out, but pretended to be ſet
up, though this Kingly power be much fought againſt both
by Parliament, Armie, Clergie, and people; but when they
are made to ſee him, then they ſhall mourn, becauſe they
have perſecuted him.</p>
            <p>But the other Kingly power, is the power of untighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which indeed is the Devil; And O that there were ſuch
a heart in Parliament and Army, as to perform your own
Act; then People would never complain of you for breach of
Covenant, for your Covetouſneſs, Pride, and too much Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking
that is in you. And you on the other-ſide would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have cauſe to complain of the Peoples murmurings againſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117691:3"/>
you. Truly this jarring that is between you and the People
is, The Kingly Power; yea that very Kingly power which you
have made an Act to caſt out; therefore ſee it be fulfilled on
your part; for the Kingly power of Righteouſneſs expects it,
or elſe he will caſt you out for Hypocrites and unſavory Salt;
for he looks upon all your Actions, and truly, there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Ruſt about your Actings, which makes them that
they do not ſhine bright</p>
            <p>This Kingly power, is covetouſneſs in his branches, or the
power of ſelf-love, ruling in one or in many men over others,
and enſlaving thoſe who in the Creation are their equals;
nay, who are in the ſtrictneſs of equity rather their Maſters:
And this Kingly power is uſually ſet in the Chair of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
under the name of Prerogative, when he rules in one,
over other: And under the name of State Priviledge of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
when he rules in many over others: and this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power, is alwayes raiſed up, and eſtabliſhed by the Sword,
and therefore he is called the Murderer, or the great red
Dragon, which fights againſt <hi>Michael,</hi> for he enſlaves the
weakneſs of the People under him, denying an equal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the Earth to every one, which the Law of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
gave every man in his creation. This I ſay is Kingly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
under darkneſs, and as he rules in men, ſo he makes men
jar one againſt another, and is the cauſe of all Wars and
Complainings; he is known by his outward actions, and his
action at this very day fills all places; for this power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
rules, and would rule, and is that only Enemy that fights
againſt Creation and National Freedom: And this Kingly
power is he, which you have made an Act of Parliament to caſt
out. And now you Rulers of <hi>England,</hi> play the men, and be
valiant for the Truth, which is Chriſt: for aſſure your ſelves
God will not be mocked, nor the Devil will not be mocked;
for Firſt you ſay and profeſs you own the Scriptures of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles, and God looks that you ſhould perform
that Word in action: Secondly you have Declared againſt
the Devil, and if you do not now go through with your work,
but ſlack your hand by hypocritical ſelf-love, and ſo ſuffer this
dark Kingly power to riſe higher and Rule, you ſhall find,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117691:4"/>
he will maule both you, and yours to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The life of this dark Kingly power, which you have made
an Act of Parliament and Oath to caſt out, if you ſearch it to
the bottom, you ſhall ſee it lies within the iron cheſt of curſed
Covetouſneſs, who gives the Earth to ſome part of mankind,
and denies it to another part of mankind: and that part that
hath the Earth, hath no right frow the Law of creation to take
it to himſelf, and ſhut out others; but he took it away vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
by Theft and Murder in Conqueſt: As when our Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>William</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> and conquered, he turned
the Engliſh out, and gave the Land unto his Norman Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
every man his parcel to incloſe, and hence roſe up Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for this is the fruit of War from the beginning, for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
Propriety out of a weaker into a ſtronger hand, but
ſtill upholds the curſe of Bondage; and hereby the Kingly
power which you have made an Act, and Sworn to caſt out,
does remove himſelf from one chair to another; and ſo long
as the Sword rules over brethren, (mind what I ſay) ſo long
the Kingly power of darkneſs Rules, and ſo large as yet is his
Kingdom; which ſpreds from Sea to Sea, and fills the Earth;
but Chriſt is riſing who will take the Dominion and Kingdom
out of his hand, and his power of Righteouſneſs ſhall riſe
and ſpred from Eaſt to Weſt, from North to South, and fill
the Earth with himſelf, and caſt the other curſed power out,
when Coveteouſneſs ſheaths his Sword, and ceaſes to rage in
the field; he firſt makes ſharp Laws of Bondage. That thoſe
that are conquered, and that by him are appointed not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Earth, but are turned out, ſhall be Servants, Slaves,
and Vaſſals to the Conquerers party: ſo thoſe Laws that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
Whips, Priſons, Gallows is but the ſame power of the
Sword that raged, and that was drunk with Blood in the
field.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles,</hi> it is true, was the Head of this Kingly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in <hi>England,</hi> and he Reigned as he was a Succeſſor of
the laſt Norman Conquerer: and whoſoever you be, that
hath Propriety of Land, hath your Titles and Evidences made
to you in his or his Anceſtors Name, and from his and their
Will and Kingly power; I am ſure, he was not our Creator,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117691:4"/>
and therefore parcelled out the Earth to ſome, and denied it
to others, therefore he muſt needs ſtand as a Conquerer, and
was the Head of this Kingly power, that burdens and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
the People, and that is the cauſe of all our Wars and
Diviſions; for if this Kingly power of Covetouſneſs, which
is the unrighteous Divider, did not yet Rule: both Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Army, and rich People, would cheerfully give conſent
that thoſe we call Poor ſhould Dig and freely Plant the Waſte
and Common Land for a livelihood, ſeing there is Land e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and more by half then is made uſe of, and not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to periſh for want. And yet O ye Rulers of <hi>England,</hi>
you make a blazing profeſſion, That you know, and that you
own God, Chriſt, and the Scriptures: but did Chriſt ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
ſuch hardneſs of heart? did not he bid the rich man go
and ſell all that he hath and give to the Poor? and does not
the Scripture ſay, If thou makeſt a Covenant, keep it, though
it be to thy loſs: But truly it will not be to your loſs, to let
your fellow Creatures, your equals in the Creation, nay thoſe
that have been faithful in your Cauſe, and ſo your Friends;
I ſay it will not be to your loſs to let them quietly improve the
Waſte and Common Land, that they may live in peace, freed
from the heavie burdens of Poverty; for hereby our own
Land will be increaſed with all ſorts of Commodities, and the
People will be knit together in love, to keep out a forreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
that endeavours, and that will endeavour as yet, to
come like an Army of curſed Ratts and Mice to deſtroy our
inheritance; ſo that if this Freedom be quietly granted to us,
you grant it but to your ſelves, to Engliſh-men, to your own
fleſh and blood: and you do but give us our own neither,
which Covetouſneſs, in the Kingly power hath, and yet does
hold from us; for the Earth in the firſt Creation of it, was
freely given to whole mankind, without reſpect of Perſons;
therefore you Lords of Mannors, and you Rulers of <hi>England,</hi>
if you own God, Chriſt and Scripture, now make Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and deliver us quiet poſſeſſion of our Land, which the
Kingly power as yet holds from us.</p>
            <p>While this Kingly power raigned in one man called <hi>Charls,</hi>
all ſorts of people complained of oppreſſion, both Gentrie and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117691:5"/>
Common people, becauſe their lands, Incloſures, and Copie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
were intangled, and becauſe their Trades were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
by Monopolizing Patentees, and your troubles were
that you could not live free from oppreſſion in the earth:
Thereupon you that were the Gentrie, when you were
aſſembled in Parliament, you called upon the poor Common-People
to come and help you, and caſt out oppreſſion; and
you that complained are helped and freed, and that top-bow
is lopped off the tree of Tyrannie, and Kingly power in
that one particular is caſt out; but alas oppreſſion is a great
tree ſtill, and keeps off the ſon of freedome from the poor
Commons ſtill, he hath many branches and great roots which
muſt be grub'd up, before every one can ſing Sions ſongs in
peace.</p>
            <p>As we ſpie out Kinglie power we muſt declare it, and caſt
it out, or elſe we ſhall deny the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> and
their Acts, and ſo prove Traitors to the Land, by denying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
thereunto. Now there are Three Branches
more of Kinglie power greater then the former that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
this Land wonderfully; and theſe are the power of
the Tithing Prieſts over the Tenths of our labours; and the
power of Lords of Mannors, holding the free uſe of the

oppreſſion either of bad Laws, or of bad Judges cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting

and Kingly power ſtill, and wants a Reformation.</p>
            <p>For as for the firſt, <hi>William</hi> the Couqueror promiſed, That
if the Clergie would preach him up, ſo that the people might
be bewitched, ſo as to receive him to be Gods Anointed over
them, he would give them the Tenths of the Lands increaſe
yeerly; and they did it, and he made good his Promiſe; and
do we not yet ſee, That if the Clergie can get Tithes or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
they will turn as the Ruling power turns, any way; to
Popery, to Proteſtaniſme; for a King, againſt a King, for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
for State-Government; they cry who bids moſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
they will be on the ſtrongeſt ſide, for an Earthly mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
yea, and when they are lifted up, they would Rule
too, becauſe they are called Spiritual men: It is true indeed,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117691:5"/>
they are ſpiritual; but it is of the ſpiritual power of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and Pride; for the ſpiritual power of Love and
Righteouſneſs they know not; for if they knew it, they
would not perſecute and raile againſt him as <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey do.</p>
            <p>The Clergie will ſerve on any ſide, like our ancient Laws,
that will ſerve any Maſter: They will ſerve the Papiſts, they
will ſerve the Proteſtants, they will ſerve the King, they will
ſerve the States; they are one and the ſame Tools for Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
to work with under any Government. O you Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-men
of <hi>England,</hi> caſt thoſe whoriſh Laws out of doors,
that are ſo Common, that pretend love to every one, and is
faithful to none; for truly, he that goes to Law, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
is, ſhall die a Beggar: ſo that old Whores, and old
Laws, picks mens pockets, and undoes them: If the fault lie
in the Laws, and much does, burn all your old Law-Books in
<hi>Cheapſide,</hi> &amp; ſet up a Government upon your own Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
do not put new Wine into old Bottles; but as your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
muſt be new, ſo let the Laws be new, or elſe you will
run farther into the Mud, where you ſtick already, as though
you were faſt in an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Bogge; for you are ſo far ſunke, that
he muſt have good eyes that can ſee where you are: but yet
all are not blind, there are eyes that ſees you: but if the fault
lies in the Judges of the Law, ſurely ſuch men deſerve no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in a Reforming Common-wealth, that burdens all ſorts
of People.</p>
            <p>And truly Ile tell you plain, your Two Acts of Parliament
are excellent and Righteous: The One to caſt out Kingly
power; The Other to make <hi>England</hi> a Free Common-wealth:
build upon theſe Two, it is a firm Foundation, and your Houſe
will be the glory of the World; and I am confident, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Spirit will love you: do not ſtick in the Bogge of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs;
Let not ſelf-love ſo be-muddy your brain, that you
ſhould loſe your ſelves in the thicket of bramble buſh-words,
and ſet never a ſtrong Oak of ſome ſtable Action for the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the poor Oppreſſed that helped you when you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of Oppreſſion. Let not Pride blind your eyes, that
you ſhould forget you are the Nations Servants, and ſo prove
<hi>Solomons</hi> words good in your ſelves, That Servants ride on

Horſe-back and Coache<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, when as Princes, ſuch as Choſe you,
and ſet you there, go on foot: and many of them, through
their love to the Nation, have ſo waſted themſelves, that now
they can hardly get Bread, but with great difficulty. I tell
you this is a ſore Evil, and this is truth; therefore think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, it is a poor mans Advice, and you ſhall finde weight in
it, if you Do as well as Say.</p>
            <p>Then Secondly for Lords of Mannors, They were <hi>William</hi>
the Conquerors Colonels and Favourites, and he gave a large
circuit of Land to every one, called A Lord-ſhip, that they
might have a watchful eye, that if any of the conquered Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
ſhould begin to Plant themſelves upon any Common or
waſte Land, to live out of ſight or out of ſlavery, that then
ſome Lord of Mannor or other might ſee and know of it, and
drive them off, as theſe Lords of Mannors now a dayes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to drive off the Diggers from Digging upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
but we expect the Rulers of the Land will grant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us their Friends, the benefit of their own Acts againſt
Kingly power, and not ſuffer that Norman power to cruſh
the poor Oppreſſed, who helped them in their ſtraits, nor
ſuffer that Norman power to bud freſher out, &amp; ſo in time may
come to over-top our deer bought Freedom more then ever.</p>
            <p>Search all your Laws, and Ile adventure my life, for I have
little elſe to loſe, That all Lords of Mannors hold Title to the
Commons by no ſtronger hold then the Kings Will, whoſe
Head is cut off; and the King held Title as he was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror;
now if you caſt off the King who was the Head of
that power, ſurely the power of Lords of Mannors is the
ſame; therefore performe your own Act of Parliament, and
caſt out that part of the Kinglie power likewiſe, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may ſee you underſtand what you Say and Do, and that
you are faithful.</p>
            <p>For truly the Kinglie power reigns ſtrongly in the Lords of
Mannors over the Poor; for my own particular, I have in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writings as well as in this, Declared my Reaſons, That
the common Land is the poor Peoples Proprietie, and I have
Digged upon the Commons, and I hope in time to obtain the
Freedom, to get Food and Raiment therefrom by righteous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117691:6"/>
labour, which is all I deſire; and for ſo doing, the ſuppoſed
Lord of that Mannor hath Arreſted me twice; Firſt, in an
Action of 20 l. Treſpaſs for Plowing upon the Commons,
which I never did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe they would not ſuffer me to
Plead my own Cauſe, they made ſhift to paſs a Sentence of
Execution againſt ſome Cows I kept, ſuppoſing they had been
mine, and took them away; but the right Owner reprieved
them, &amp; fetched the Cowes back; ſo greedy are theſe Theeves
and Murderers after my life for ſpeaking the truth, and
for maintaining the Life and Marrow of the Parliaments
Cauſe in my Actions.</p>
            <p>And now they have Arreſted me again in an Action of 4. l.
treſpas for digging upon the Comons, which I did, &amp; own the
work to be righteous, &amp; no treſpas to any: This was the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of <hi>Kingſtone</hi>'s Advice, either to get Money on both ſides,
for they love Mony as deerly as a poor mans dog do his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
in a cold morning (but regard not juſtice) or elſe, That
I ſhould not remove it to a higher Court, but that the cauſe
might be tryed there, and then they know how to pleaſe the
Lords of Mannors, that have reſolved to ſpend hundreds of
pounds but they will hinder the poor from enjoying the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
for they will not ſuffer me to plead my own Cauſe, but
I muſt Fee an enemie, or elſe be condemned and executed
without mercy or Juſtice as I was before, and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o to put me in
Priſon till I pay their unrighteous Sentence; for truly At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourneys
are ſuch neat workmen, that they can turn a Cauſe
which way thoſe that have the biggeſt purſe will have them:
and the Countrie knows very well, That <hi>Kingſtone</hi> court is ſo
full of the Kinglie power; that ſome will rather loſe their
Rights, then have their cauſes tryed there: one of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of that court, told a friend of mine, That if the Diggers
cauſe was good, he would pick out ſuch a Jurie as ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
him: And upon my former Arreſt, they picked out
ſuch a Jurie as Sentenced me to pay 10. l. damages for plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the commons, which I did not do, neither did any
witneſs prove it before them: So that from <hi>Kingſtone</hi> Juries,
Lords of Mannors, and Kinglie power, <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do theſe men obey the Parliaments Acts, to throw down
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117691:7"/>
Kinglie power? O no: The ſame unrighteous doing that was
complained of in King <hi>Charles</hi> dayes, the ſame doings is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them ſtill: Monies will buy and ſell Juſtice ſtill: and is
our 8 yeers Wars come round about to lay us down again in
the kennel of injuſtice as much or more then before? are we
no farther learned yet? O ye Rulers of <hi>England,</hi> when muſt
we turn over a new leaf? will you alwayes hold us in one
Leſſon? ſurely you will make Dunces of us; then all the
Boyes in other Lands will laugh at us: come, I pray let us
take forth, and go forward in our learning.</p>
            <p>You blame us who are the Common people as though we
would have no government; truly Gentlemen, We deſire a
righteous government with all our hearts, but the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we have gives freedom and livelihood to the Gentrie,
to hae abundance, and to lock up Treaſures of the Earth
from the poor, ſo that rich men may have cheſts full of Gold
and Silver, and houſes full of Corn and Goods to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the poor that works to get it, can hardly live, and
if they cannot work like Slaves, then they muſt ſtarve. And
thus the Law gives all the Land to ſome part of mankind
whoſe Predeceſſors got it by conqueſt, and denies it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who by the righteous Law of Creation may claim an
equall portion; and yet you ſay this is a righteous go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
but ſurely it is no other but ſelf-iſhnes, which is
the great Red Dragon, the Murtherer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> is a Priſon; the variety of ſubtilties in the Laws
preſerved by the Sword, are bolts, bars, and doors of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
the Lawyers are the Jaylors, and poor men are the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners;
for let a man fall into the hands of any from the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe
to the Judge, and he is either undone, or wearie of
his life.</p>
            <p>Surely this power the Laws, which is the great Idoll that
people dote upon, is the burden of the Creation, a Nurſerie
of Idleneſs, luxurie, and cheating, the only enemie of Chriſt
the King of righteouſneſs; for though it pretend Juſtice, yet
the Judges and Law-Officers, buy and ſell Juſtice for money,
and wipes their mouths like <hi>Solomons</hi> whore, and ſays it is
my calling, and never are troubled at it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:117691:7"/>
Two things muſt caſt out this Idoll: Firſt, Let not people
ſend their children to thoſe Nurſeries of Covetouſneſs, <hi>The
Innes of Court.</hi> Secondly, let not people live in contention,
but fulfill Chriſts laſt commandment, <hi>Love;</hi> and endeavour
to practice that full point of the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Doe
as you would be done by,</hi> and ſo caſt out envie and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
Woe to you Lawyers, for your trade is the bane and
miſerie of the world; your power is the only power that
hinders Chriſt from riſing; the deſtruction of your power
will be the life of the World; it is full of confuſion, it is Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
and ſurely its fall is neer, in regard the light of truth
is riſing, who will conſume your power, but ſave your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
by the words of his mouth, and brightneſſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The Lawyers trade is one of the falſe Prophets, that ſays,
Lo here is Chriſt, Ile ſave you in this Court, and lo there is
Chriſt, Ile ſave you in that Court: but when we have tried
all, we are loſt, and not ſaved, for we are either utterly made
Beggars by this Saviour, the Law, or elſe we are nurſed up
in hardneſſe of heart and cruelty againſt our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whom we ought to love and preſerve, and not deſtroy:
This Saviour jeeres righteouſnes, and bids every man ſave
himſelf, and never regard what becomes of another, and ſo
is a plain deſtroyer of the Creation; Surely that Wo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt Lawyers by the Man Chriſt muſt be fulfilled,
delay is no payment: Therefore you Parliament and Army
that have power in your hands, reform the Law; and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
none to be called to practice Law but reformed ones;
nay ſuffer every man to plead his own cauſe, and chooſe his
own Lawyer, where he finds the moſt ingenuous man: Wel,
every mans burthen in this Age fills their mouths with words
of Lamentation againſt Law and Lawyers ſufficiently; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you that have an opportunitie to eaſe the cry of the
oppreſſed, ſhut not your eies and eares, but caſt out this
couetous corruption whereby corrupt Lawyers doe oppreſs
the People; it is another Branch of the Kingly power.</p>
            <p>You Gentlemen of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and Lords of Mannors, and
you Mr Parſon <hi>Platt</hi> eſpecially, that lay almoſt a fortnight
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117691:8"/>
waiting and tempting the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to ſend Souldiers to
drive off the Diggers; when he granted your Deſire, it was
but to ſecure the Shereiff, for he did not give them commiſſion
to beat us, which we thank him for; and we thank the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for their moderation, that they would not st<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> poor

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, though
you would have moved them thereunto. My Advice to you
Gentlemen is this, Hereafter to lie ſtill and cheriſh the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
for they love you, and would not have your finger ake
if they could help it, and why should you be ſo bitter againſt
them? O let them live by you, ſome of them have been Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and ſome countrie men that were alwayes friends to
the Parliaments cauſe, by whoſe hardſhip and meanes you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the creatures about you in peace; and will you now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
part of them that have preſerved your lives? O do not
do ſo; be not ſo beſotted with the Kinglie power; hereafter
let not the Attourneyes or Lawyers neatly councel your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
out of your purſes, and ſtir you up to beat and abuſe the
Diggers, to make all rational men laugh at your folly, and
condemn you for your bitterneſs: If you have yet ſo much
Money, give it not away to deſtroy men, but give it to ſome
poor or other to be a Stock, and bid them go and Plant the
common; this will be your honour, and your comfort; aſſure
your ſelves you never muſt have true comfort tell you be
friends with the poor; therefore come, come, love the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and make reſtitution of their Land you hold from them,
for what would you do if you had not ſuch labouring men to
work for you?</p>
            <p>And you great Officers of the Army and Parliament, love
your common Souldiers, (I plead for Equity and Reaſon) and
do not force them by long delay of Payment to ſell you their
deer bought Debenters for a thing of naught, and then to go
and buy our common Land, and crown Land, and other Land
that is the ſpoil one of another, therewith: Remember you
are Servants to the commons of <hi>England,</hi> and you were Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers
in the Wars, and the common people have paid you
for your pains ſo largely, that ſome of us have not left our
ſelves hardly bread to eate; and therefore if there be a ſpoil
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117691:8"/>
to be gathered of crown Lands, Deans, Biſhops, Forreſts
Lands and commons, that is to come to the poor commons
freely; and you ought to be content with your wages, unleſs
you will denie Chriſt and the Scriptures; and you ought not
to go and buy one of another that which is common to all the
Nation; for you ought neither to buy nor ſell other mens Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
by the Law of creation; for Chriſt gives you no ſuch
Warrant. As ſoon as you have freed the Earth from one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement
of Kinglie power, will you intangle it more, and
worſe by another degree of Kinglie power? I pray conſider
what you do, and do righteouſly: We that are the poor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that paid our Money, and gave you free Quarter, have
as much Right in thoſe crown Lands and Lands of the ſpoil as
you; therefore we give no conſent That you ſhould buy and
ſell our crown Lands and waſte Lands, for it is our purchaſed
inheritance from under Oppreſſion, it is our own, even the
poor common peoples of <hi>England:</hi> It was taken from us, and
hath been held from us by former conqueſts, whereof the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
conqueſt was the laſt, which is caſt out by yours and our
joynt Aſſiſtance; therefore you cannot in Equity take it from
us, nor we cannot in Equity take it from you, for it is our
joynt purchaſed inheritance; we paid you your wages to help
us to recover it, but not to take it to your ſelves, and turn us
out, and buy and ſell it among your ſelves; for this is a cheat
of the Kinglie ſwordlie power which you hold up; and we
profeſs to all the world, in ſo doing you denie God, Chriſt and
the Scriptures whom ye profeſſed you own: for God, Chriſt,
and Scriptures owne no ſuch practice: Likewiſe we profeſs
to all the Creation, That in ſo doing, you rob us of our Rights;
&amp; you kill us, by denying to give us our livelihood in our own
inheritance freely, which is the crown Land and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Land
and waſte Lands, Biſhops &amp; Deans, which ſome of you begin
to ſay you are not ſatisfied in your conſcience to let us have;
I, well ſpoke, tender hearted Covetouſneſs; if you do ſo, you
will uphold the Kinglie power, and ſo diſobey both Acts of
Parliament, and break your Oath, and you will live in the
breach of thoſe Two Commandements, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill:
Thou ſhalt not ſteal;</hi> by denying us the Earth which is our
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117691:9"/>
Livelyhood, and thereby killing us by a lingring death.</p>
            <p>Well, the end of all my Speech is to point out the Kingly
power, where I ſpie it out, and you ſee it remains ſtrongly in
the hands of Lords of Mannors, who have delt diſcourteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with ſome who are ſincere in heart, though there have
ſome come among the Diggers that have cauſed ſcandall, but
we diſ-own their wayes.</p>
            <p>The Lords of Mannors have ſent to beat us, to pull down
our houſes, ſpoil our labours; yet we are patient, and never
offered any violence to them again, this 40 weeks paſt, but
wait upon God with love till their hearts thereby be ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
and all that we deſire is, but to live quietly in the land
of our nativity, by our righteous labour, upon the common
Land which is our own, but as yet the Lords of the Mannor
ſo formerly called, will not ſuffer us, but abuſe us. Is not
that part of the Kingly power? In that which follows I ſhall
cleerly prove it is, for it appears ſo cleer that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of a child does ſay, It is Tyranny, it is the Kingly
power of darkneſs, therefore we expect that you will grant
us the benefit of your Act of Parliament that we may ſay, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>England</hi> is a Common-wealth, and a free people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>Sirs, Though your Tithing Prieſts and others tell you, That
we Diggers do deny God, Chriſt, and the Scripture, to make
us odious, and themſelves better thought of; yet you will ſee
in time when the King of Righteouſneſs whom we ſerve
does cleer our innnocencie, That our actions and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the very life of the Scripture, and holds forth the true
power of God and Chriſt. For is not the end of all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praying, and profeſſion wrapped up in this action, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Love your enemies, and doe to all men, as you would they
ſhould do to you, for this is the very Law and the Prophets.</hi>
This is the New Commandement that Chriſt left behind him.
Now if any ſeem to ſay this, and does not do this, but acts
contrary, for my part I owne not their wayes, they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that uphold the curſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:117691:9"/>
Bare talking of righteouſneſſe, and not acting, hath ruled,
and yet does rule king of darkneſs in the creation; and it is the
cauſe of all this immoderate confuſion and ignorance that is
in men.</p>
            <p>But the actings of righteouſneſſe from the inward power of
love, ſhall rule King of righteouſneſſe in the creation now in
theſe later dayes, and caſt the other Serpent and fiery Scorpion
out; for this is Chriſt the reſtoring power: and as he riſes up,
ſo multitude of words without action (which is hypocriſie) is to
die, his judgment haſtens apace.</p>
            <p>If any ſort of people hold the earth to themſelves by the
dark Kingly power, and ſhut out others from that freedom,
they deny God, Chriſt, and Scriptures, and they overthrow all
their preaching, praying, and profeſſion; for the Scriptures
declare them to be Hypocrites, Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>that ſay,
and do not;</hi> they have words, and no deeds: Like Parſon <hi>Platt</hi>
the Preacher at <hi>Horſley</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> a Lord of Mannor (by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage)
of the place where we digg, who cauſed a poor old mans
houſe that ſtood upon the Common, to be pulled down in the
evening of a cold day, and turned the old man, and his wife,
and daughter to lie in the open field, becauſe he was a Digger:
and he, and other Lords of Mannors, and Gentlemen ſent their
ſervants up and down the Town, to bid their Tenants and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
neither to give the Diggers lodging nor victuals, on pain
of their diſpleaſure. Though this Parſon <hi>Platt</hi> preach the
Scriptures, yet I'll affirm, he denyes God, Chriſt, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and knowes nothing of them; for covetouſneſs, pride,
and envie hath blinded his eyes. A man knowes no more of
righteouſneſs than he hath power to act; and ſurely, this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of preaching <hi>Platt</hi> is an unrighteous act.</p>
            <p>If the Diggers were enemies, (oh you Lords of Mannors) as
they are not, you ought to love them: I am ſure, they love
you; and if you doubt it, put them to the tryall; you ſhall
find them more faithfull than many of thoſe pick-thank ſlaves,
and belly-god ſervants to whom your ears are open, when they
bring tales full of envie to you againſt us.</p>
            <p>We are told likewiſe, That to make us who are called Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
odious, and to incenſe you againſt us, there came to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117691:10"/>
Generall and Councell of State, divers Juſtices, and others, and
told you, that we Diggers were Cavaliers, and that we waited
an opportunity, and gathered together to ſtand up for the
Prince.</p>
            <p>But all that know us can prove that to be a falſe report, to
the diſhonour of thoſe Juſtices; for we have been friends to
the Parliaments cauſe, and ſo do continue, and will continue;
for this work of digging, to make <hi>England</hi> a free Common-wealth,
is the life and marrow of the Parliaments cauſe. And
the two Acts of Parliament, the One, to caſt out Kingly power,
the Other, to make <hi>England</hi> a free Common-wealth, declares
it: and we do obey thoſe Acts, and will obey them, for they
hold forth righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>But for our riſing in arms for the Prince, or any other, let
any come and ſee our ſtrength and work, and they will ſay,
It is a meer envious ſlander caſt upon us, to incenſe you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us.</p>
            <p>Beſides, You ſhall ſee by and by, That our principles are
wholly againſt Kingly power in every one, as well as in one.
Likewiſe we hear, that they told you, that the Diggers do ſteal
and rob from others. This likewiſe is a ſlander: we have
things ſtollen from us; but if any can prove that any of us do
ſteal any mans proper goods, as Sheep, Geeſe, Pigs, as they
ſay, let ſuch be made a ſpectacle to all the world: For my part,
I own no ſuch doing, neither do I know any ſuch thing by any
of the Diggers. Likewiſe they report, that we Diggers hold
women to be common, and live in that beſtialneſſe: For my
part, I declare againſt it; I own this to be a truth, That the
earth ought to be a common Treaſury to all; but as for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>Let every man have his own wife, and every woman her
own huſband;</hi> and I know none of the Diggers that act in ſuch
an unrationall exceſſe of female communitie: If any ſhould,
I profeſſe to have nothing to do with ſuch people, but leave
them to their own Maſter, who will pay them with torment of
minde, and diſeaſes in their bodies.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch-like tales, we hear, are brought to you, to
incenſe you againſt us: but we deſire you to mark them that
bring them, for we partly know who they be, and we can tell
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117691:10"/>
them to their faces, they were Cavaliers, and had hands in the
Kentiſh Riſing, and in ſtirring up that offenſive <hi>Surrey</hi> Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was the occaſion of bloodſhed in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-yard,
and they would rejoyce to ſee the Prince come in with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to over-top you: for we know, they love you not but
from the teeth outwards, for their own ends: And theſe are
the proud <hi>Hamans,</hi> that would incenſe you againſt the <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies</hi>
of the Land, even your true-hearted friends, the Diggers.
Well, in the midſt of our ſlanders we rejoyce in the uprightneſs
of our hearts, and we do <hi>commit our cauſe to him that judgeth
righteouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe lying reports, and importunitie to the General, it
ſeems the General granted the Lords of Mannor to have ſome
ſouldiers to go along with the Sheriff, to pull down the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
houſes; and ſo the ſouldiers did come: but they were
very moderate and rationall men, and as they were ſent to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Sheriff, ſo they did: but there was no cauſe; for,
though the Gentlemen poſſeſs'd the General, that they feared
oppoſition from the Diggers, yet the ſouldiers ſaw they lifted
not up a finger in diſcontent, but fought againſt thoſe dragons,
the Lords of Manors, with the ſpirit of love and patience: for
when the two Lords of Manor ſat among the ſouldiers on horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
and coach, and commanded their fearfull tenants to pull
down one of the Diggers houſes before their faces, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with ſhouting at the fall; yet ſome of the Diggers ſtood
by, and were very chearfull, and preached the Goſpel to thoſe
Turkiſh <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> which are words of life, and in time will
prove words of terrour, to torment their awakened conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>And the poor tenants that pulled down the houſe, durſt do
no other, becauſe their Land-lords and Lords looked on, for
fear they ſhould be turned out of ſervice, or their livings; as a
a poor honeſt man, becauſe he looked with a cheerfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
upon the Diggers (though he was affraid to come neer,
or affraid to ſpeak openly, leſt his Landlords ſetting-dogs ſhould
ſmell the ſound of his words, and carry a pick-thank tale, which
his Lords ears are much open to) a Baily was ſent preſently to
him, to warn him out of his houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117691:11"/>
Can the Turkiſh Baſhaws hold their ſlaves in more bondage
than theſe Goſpel-profeſſing Lords of Manors do their poor
tenants? and is not this the Kingly power? O you Rulers of
<hi>England,</hi> I pay ſee that your own acts be obeyed, and let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
go free.</p>
            <p>And when the poor enforced ſlaves had pulled down the
houſe, then their Lords gave them ten ſhillings to drink, and
there they ſmiled one upon another; being fearfull, like a dog
that is kept in awe, when his Maſter gives him a bone, and
ſtands over him with a whip; he will eat, and look up, and
twinch his tail; for they durſt not laugh out, left their Lords
ſhould hear they jeer'd them openly; for in their hearts they
are Diggers. Therefore, you Lords of Manors, if you have none
to ſtand for you but whom you force by threatning, then leave
off ſtriving againſt the ſpirit, and ſay you are fallen, and come
in and embrace righteouſneſſe, that you may finde mercy
betimes.</p>
            <p>The next day after this, there came two ſouldiers and three
Country-men to another houſe which the Diggers had ſet up,
(which the Sheriff the day before had let alone, for, as ſome
ſay, he was grieved to ſee what was done,) one of theſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
was very civill, and walked lovingly with the Diggers
round their corn which they had planted, and commended the
work, and would do no harm (as divers others were of the
ſame minde) and when he went his way, gave the Diggers
12 <hi>d.</hi> to drink: but the other ſouldier was ſo rude, that he
forced thoſe three Country-men to help him to pull down the
houſe, and railed bitterly: the men were unwilling to pull it
down; but for fear of their Landlords, and the threatning
ſouldier, they did put their hands to pull it down.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing Parſon <hi>Platt</hi> (the Lord of that Manor) will not
ſuffer the Diggers to have a houſe, (wherein he forgets his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Chriſt, that is perſecuted in naked, hungry, and houſeleſſe
members) yet the Diggers were mighty cheerfull, and their
ſpirits reſolve to wait upon God, to ſee what he will do, and
they have built them ſome few little hutches like calf-cribs, and
there they lie anights, and follow their work adayes ſtill with
wonderfull joy of heart, taking the ſpoyling of their goods
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117691:11"/>
cheerfully, counting it a great happineſſe to be perſecuted for
righteouſneſſe ſake, by the Prieſts and Profeſſors, that are the
ſucceſſors of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the bitter-ſpirited Phariſees that put the
man Chriſt <hi>Jeſus</hi> to death. And they have planted divers A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
of Wheat and Rye, which is come up, and promiſes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hopefull crop, committing their cauſe to God, and wait
upon him, ſaying, O thou King of righteouſneſſe, do thine
own work.</p>
            <p>O that you would ſearch and try our wayes narrowly, and
ſee whether we deny God, Chriſt, Scriptures, as the Prieſts ſlander
us we do; and you ſhall finde, that the Scriptures warrant our
action, and God in Chriſt is the life of our ſouls, and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of our ſpirits in the midſt of this our ſharp perſecution
from the hands of unreaſonable men, who have not faith in
Chriſt, but uphold the Kingly power, which you have Voted
down.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, you ſhall ſee, that we live in the performance of
that work which is the very life and marrow of the Parliaments
Cauſe, whereby we honour the Parliament and their Cauſe:
as you ſhall ſee by this following Declaration, unfolding the
foundation whereupon <hi>Englands</hi> Laws are, or the Freedom
of a Common-wealth ought to be built, which is Equity and
Reaſon.</p>
            <p>IN the time of the Kings, who came in as Conquerors, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the power of the Sword, not only the Common land,
but the Incloſures alſo were captivated under the will of thoſe
Kings, till now of late that our later Kings granted more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the Gentry than they had preſently after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;
yet under bondage ſtill: for what are priſons, whips
and gallows in the times of peace, but the laws and power of
the ſword, forcing and compelling obedience, and ſo enſlaving,
as if the ſword raged in the open field?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> was in ſuch a ſlavery under the Kingly power, that
both Gentry and Commonaltie groaned under bondage; and
to eaſe themſelves, they endeavoured to call a Parliament, that
by their counſels and decrees they might find ſome freedom.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Charles</hi> the then King perceiving that the Freedom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117691:12"/>
they ſtrove for, would derogate from his Prerogative-tyranny,
therupon he goes into the North, to raiſe a War againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and took WILLIAM <hi>the Conqueror's</hi> Sword into his
hand again, thereby to keep under the former conquered Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and to uphold his Kingly power of ſelf-will and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which was the power got by former Conqueſts; that is,
to rule over the lives and eſtates of all men at his will, and ſo
to make us pure ſlaves and vaſſals.</p>
            <p>Well, This Parliament, that did conſiſt of the chief Lords,
Lords of Manors, and Gentry, and they ſeeing that the King,
by raiſing an Army, did thereby declare his intent to enſlave
all ſorts to him by the ſword; and being in diſtreſſe, and in a
low ebb, they call upon the common people to bring in their
Plate, Moneys, Taxes, Free-quarter, Exciſe, and to adventure
their lives with them, and they would endeavour to recover
<hi>England</hi> from that <hi>Norman</hi> yoak, and make us a free people:
and the common people aſſent hereunto, and call this the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
Cauſe, and own it, and adventure perſon and purſe to
preſerve it; and by the joynt aſſiſtance of Parliament and
People, the King was beaten in the field, his head taken off, and
his Kingly power voted down; and we the Commons thereby
virtually have recovered our ſelves from the Norman Conqueſt,
we want nothing but poſſeſſion of the ſpoyl, which is a free uſe
of the Land for our livelyhood.</p>
            <p>And from hence we the common people, or younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
plead our propriety in the Common land, as truly our
own by vertue of this victory over the King; as our elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
can plead proprietie in their Incloſures; and that for three
reaſons in <hi>Englands</hi> law.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By a lawfull purchaſe or contract between the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and us; for they were our Landlords and Lords of
Mannors that held the freedom of the Commons from us,
while the King was in his power; for they held title thereunto
from him, he being the head, and they branches of the Kingly
power, that enſlaved the people by that ancient Conquerors
Sword, that was the ruling power: For they ſaid, Come and
help us againſt the King that enſlaves us, that we may be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117691:12"/>
delivered from his Tyranny, and we will make you a free
People.</p>
            <p>Now they cannot make us free, unleſſe they deliver us from
the bondage which they themſelves held us under; and that is,
they held the freedom of the Earth from us: for we in part
with them have delivered our ſelves from the King: now we
claim freedom from that bondage you have, and yet do hold us
under, by the bargain and contract between Parliament and
us, who (I ſay) did conſiſt of Lords of Manors, and Landlords,
whereof Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> who hath arreſted me for digging upon
the Common, was one at that time: Therefore by the law of
Bargain and Sale, we claim of them our freedom, to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
with them in this Land of our Nativity; and this we
cannot do, ſo long as we lie under poverty, and muſt not be
ſuffered to plant the commons and waſte land for our liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
for, take away the land from any people, and thoſe
people are in a way of continuall death and miſery; and
better not to have had a body, than not to have food and
rayment for it. But (I ſay) they have ſold us our freedom in
the common, and have been largely paid for it; for by means
of our bloods and money, they ſit in peace: for if the King
had prevailed, they had loſt all, and been in ſlavery to the
meaneſt Cavalier, if the King would. Therfore we the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ſay, Give us our bargain: if you deny us our bargain, you
deny God, Chriſt, and Scriptures; and all your profeſſion then
is and hath been hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Commons and Crown land is our propriety by
equall conqueſt over the Kingly power: for the Parl did never
ſtir up the people by promiſes and covenant to aſſiſt them to
caſt out the King, and to eſtabliſh them in the Kings place and
prerogative power: No, but all their Declarations were for the
ſafety and peace of the whole Nation.</p>
            <p>Therefore the common-people being part of the Nation, and
eſpecially they that bore the greateſt heat of the day in caſting
out the oppreſſor: and the Nation cannot be in peace, ſo long
as the poor oppreſſed are in wants, and the land is intangled
and held from them by bondage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:117691:13"/>
But the Victory being obtained over the King, the ſpoyl
which is properly the Land, ought in equity to be divided now
between the two Parties, that is, Parliament and Common-people.
The Parliament, conſiſting of Lords of Manors, and
Gentry, ought to have their incloſure Lands free to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moleſtation, as they are freed from the Court of Wards.</p>
            <p>And the Common-people, conſiſting of Souldiers, and ſuch
as paid Taxes and Free-quarter, ought to have the freedom of
all waſte and common land, and Crown-land equally among
them; the Souldiery ought not in equity to have all, nor
the other people that paid them to have all; but the ſpoyle
ought to be divided between them that ſtay'd at home, and
them that went to Warr; for the Victory is for the whole
Nation.</p>
            <p>And as the Parliament declared, they did all for the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not for themſelves onely; ſo we plead with the Armie,
they did not fight for themſelves, but for the freedom of the
Nation: and I ſay, we have bought our Freedom of them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
by Taxes and Free-quarter: therefore we claim an equall
Freedom with them in this Conqueſt over the King.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We claim an equall portion in the Victory over
the King, by vertue of the two Acts of Parliament, the One to
make <hi>England</hi> a Free-Common-wealth; the Other to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Kingly power. Now the Kingly power (you have heard)
is a power that rules by the Sword in covetouſneſſe and ſelf, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the earth to ſome, and denying it to others: and this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power was not in the hand of the King alone; but Lords,
and Lords of Manors, and corrupt Judges, and Lawyers eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
held it up likewiſe; for he was the head, and they, with
the Tything-prieſts are the branches of that Tyrannical Kingly
power; and all the ſeveral limbs and members muſt be caſt
out, before Kingly power can be pulled up root and branch.
Miſtake me not, I do not ſay, Caſt out the perſons of men:
No, I do not deſire their fingers to ake: but I ſay, Caſt out
their power, whereby they hold the people in bondage, as the
King held them in bondage. And I ſay, it is our own Freedom
we claim, both by bargain, and by equality in the Conqueſt;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117691:13"/>
as well as by the Law of righteous Creation, which gives the
Earth to all equally.</p>
            <p>And the power of Lords of Mannors lies in this: They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Common people the uſe and free benefit of the Earth,
unleſs they give them leave, and pay them for it, either in
Rent, in Fines, in Homages, or Heriots. Surely the Earth was
never made by God, that the Younger brother ſhould not
live in the Earth, unleſs he would work for, and pay his Elder
brother Rent for the Earth: No; this Slavery came in by
Conqueſt, and it is part of the Kingly power; and <hi>England</hi>
cannot be a Free Common-wealth, till this Bondage be taken
away. You have taken away the King; you have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Houſe of Lords: Now ſtep two ſteps further, and
take away the power of Lords of Mannors, and of Tything
Prieſts, and the intolerable oppreſſions of Judges, by whom
Laws are corrupted; and your work will be honourable.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if this Freedom be denied the Common people,
To enjoy the Common Land; then Parliament, Army and
Judges will deny Equity and Reaſon, whereupon the Laws of
a well-governed Common-wealth ought to be built: And if
this Equity be denied, then there can be no Law, but Club-Law,
among the people: and if the Sword muſt raign, then
every Party will be ſtriving to bear the Sword; and then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
Peace; nay, farewel Religion and Goſpel, unleſs it be
made uſe of to intrap one another, as we plainly ſee ſome
Prieſts and others make it a Cloke for their Knavery. If I
adventure my life, and fruit of my labour, equal with you,
and obtain what we ſtrive for: it is both Equity and Reaſon,
that I ſhould equally divide the Spoil with you, and not you
to have all, and I none: And if you deny us this, you take
away our Propriety from us, our Moneys and Blood, and give
us nothing for it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I ſay, the Common Land is my own Land, equal
with my fellow-Commoners; and our true Propriety, by the
Law of Creation: it is every ones, but not one ſingle ones:
Yea, the Commons are as truely ours by the laſt excellent two
Acts of Parliament, the Foundation of <hi>Englands</hi> new righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117691:14"/>
Government aimed at, as the Elder brothers can ſay the
Incloſures are theirs: for they adventured their Lives, and
covenanted with us to help them to preſerve their Freedom:
And we adventured our lives, and they covenanted with us, to
purchaſe and to give us our Freedom, that hath been hundreds
of yeers kept from us.</p>

            <p>True Religion, and undefiled, is this, To make reſtitution
of the Earth, which hath been taken and held from the
Common people, by the power of Conqueſts formerly, and
ſo <hi>ſet the oppreſſed free.</hi> Do not All ſtrive to enjoy the Land?
The Gentry ſtrive for Land, the Clergie ſtrive for Land, the
Common people ſtrive for Land; and Buying and Selling is
an Art, whereby people endeavour to cheat one another of
the Land. Now if any can prove, from the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
that the Land was made peculiar to him and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively,
ſhutting others out, he ſhall enjoy it freely, for my
part: But I affirm, It was made for all; and true Religion
is, To let every one enjoy it. Therefore, you Rulers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
make reſtitution of the Lands which the Kingly power
holds from us: <hi>Set the oppreſſed free;</hi> and come in, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

            <head>The CURSE and BLESSING that is in
MANKINDE.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of Time, the Spirit of Univerſal Love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be the father of all things: The Creation of Fire,
Water, Earth, and Air, came out of him, and is his clothing
<hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Creation is the Houſe or Garden, in which this one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
hath taken up his ſeat, and in which he manifeſts himſelf:
For if ever Love be ſeen or known, he appears either in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
feeling within your hearts, loving All with tender love; or
elſe appears towards you, from outward objects, as from other
Men, or other creatures.</p>
            <p>There are two Earths, in which the Spirit of Love declares
himſelf. Firſt, the Living Earth, called <hi>Mankinde:</hi> this is the
Creation, or the living ſoul. And when this Spirit of univerſal
Love rules King therein, this Earth is then in peace, and is grown
up to the perfection of a man anointed. But when Self or
Particular love rules, which is called the ſin Covetouſneſs, then
this Earth is brought into Bondage, and Sorrow fills all places.
This is the dark ſide of the Cloud, in which there is no true
peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the great Body of Earth in which all creatures
ſubſiſt, the Spirit of Univerſal Love appears, to preſerve his
Creation in peace: for Univerſal Love unites not onely Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
into an oneneſs, bnt unites all other creatures into a
ſweet harmony of willingneſs to preſerve Mankinde. And this
Spirit of Love ſpread abroad, is the ſame Spirit of Love that is
ſupreme in Man: and this is the Righteous man.</p>
            <p>But when Covetouſneſs or Particular love began to work,
then not onely Mankinde was divided amongſt themſelves, but
all creatures were divided, and enmity roſe up amongſt them,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117691:15"/>
ſetting one againſt another; and this power is the wicked
man: mark him where you ſee him, which is the Murderer,
and muſt be caſt out.</p>
            <p>Wel, In the begining, univerſal love appeared to be the father
of al things, (though ſelf-love in our experience rules in man
firſt) and as he made mankinde to be the Lord of the Earth,
ſo he made the Earth to be a common Treaſury of livelihood
to whole mankind without reſpect of perſons; and for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures likewiſe that were to proceed from the Earth.</p>
            <p>Mankind is the chief creature, and the Spirit of univerſal
Love in his branches, is the Lord of all the Earth; and this
Spirit in man unfolds himſelf in Light and Darkneſs: his face
is called the univerſal power of Love: his back parts is called
the ſelviſh power: or thus, the one is called the Son of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
which cauſes ſhame, the other is called the Son of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which brings peace and honour: theſe Two ſtrive in
the womb of the Earth which ſhal come forth firſt; and which
ſhall rule; the fleſhy man, hath got the ſtart; but the other
will prove the ſtronger, and caſt him out with honour.</p>
            <p>While this Spirit of Lordſhip in the laſt day time of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
was univerſal Love and Righteouſneſs leading every
ſingle branch of mankind to do to another as he would be
done unto; then every thing was in peace, and there was a
ſweet communion of Love in the creation: and as the Spirit
was a common Treaſurie of Unitie and Peace within, ſo the
Earth was a common Treaſurie of delight for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their bodies without, ſo that there was nothing but
peace upon the face of the whole Earth.</p>
            <p>This was mans eſtate, before the fall or the day time of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
for ſince the time that our Bibles ſpeak of <hi>Adam</hi> to this
day, is about 6000 yeers; and this time hath been the night
time of mankind: aud <hi>Eſays</hi> time was about midnight when
in one of his words he cries, <hi>Watchman, What of the night?
Watchman, What of the night?</hi> the ſeventh thouſand yeer
which is now dawning, will be the riſing of the Son of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Love again, and of the diſperſing of the night or darkneſs;
for as the night and day Sun and Moon hath their exchanges,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117691:15"/>
ſo hath theſe Two powers, called Sons of God in mankind;
and in this age wherein we now live, is the expiring of the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
power, and the riſing up of the Bleſſing which hath been
ſpoke of in al ages, but now appearing like lightning from eaſt
to weſt, caſting out the Myſterie of Iniquitie, or ſelf power,
by the word of his mouth, and by the brightneſs of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and ſo bringing peace.</p>
            <p>So that, as there is the power of Light, which is univerſal
Love, called the Bleſſing which brings Peace; ſo there is the
power of Darkneſs, which is particular or ſelf love, and this is
called the Curſe, for it brings ſorrow and while this rules
King in the Earth, as it doth at this day viſibly through the
whole Earth, few are ſaved, that is, few enter into reſt and
peace; for this power hath filled all places, with his ſtinking
ſelf ſeeking Government, and troubles every body.</p>
            <p>As there is light and darkneſs, day and night, clouds and
cleerneſs moving upon the face of the great Earth; and as
there is Earth and Waters in the great World which runs
round; ſo mankind is called ſometimes Earth, ſometimes Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and as the Sun in the skies moves upon the great Earth
and makes that fruitful which ſeemed dead, while the Sun is
under the dark cloudy winter quarter:</p>
            <p>Even ſo the Son of univerſal Love, who is the Spirit and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of univerſal Freedom, he moves upon the living waters
mankind, and makes him, who all the dark time paſt was a
Chaos of confuſion, lying under Types, Shadows, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
Forms, Cuſtomes, Ordinances, and heaps of waſte words,
under which the Spirit of Truth lay buried, now to enlighten,
to worſhip in Spirit and Truth, and to bring forth fruit of
Righteouſneſs in action.</p>
            <p>In our preſent experience, The darkneſs or ſelf love goeth
before; and light or univerſal love follows after; the fleſh
runs haſty and quick, and loſes himſelf in unrational exceſſive
action; the true Spirit comes ſlowly after, and takes the
Crown.</p>
            <p>Darkneſs and Bondage, doth oppreſs Liberty and Light;
and the power of univerſal Love appears moſt ſweet and full
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117691:16"/>
of glory, when the power of ſelf Love or Covetouſneſs hath
tortured the Creation (mankind) with bitter Tyranny: for this
is the Dragon or Murderer that muſt be caſt out; before the
Creation (man) can ſing <hi>Haelelujah</hi> in peace.</p>
            <p>So then you may ſee, That the innocency, light, and purity
of mankind is this, when the Spirit of univerſal Love lives in
him, and he lives in Love, enjoying the ſweet Union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Spirit, each with other.</p>
            <p>When they enjoy the ſweet delight of the Unitie of one
Spirit, and the free content of the fruits and crops of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Earth, upon which their bodies ſtand: this was called
The mans innocency, or pleaſure in the Garden before his fall,
or the day time of mankind; and day is more glorious then
night; and greater honour to be a child of the day, then of
the night.</p>
            <p>The fall of mankind, or his darkneſs is this, When that Son
of univerſal Love, which was the ſeed, out of which the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſprung forth, did begin to go behind the cloud of fleſh,
and to let ſelf-ſeeking fleſh which would needs be a God,
ſtand alone by his imaginary light, as we ſee, while the Sun is
in the skies, a man ſees and knows his footſteps, but when the
Sun is ſet under the cloud of the dark night, then he imagins
his way, and oft times ſtumbles and falls:</p>
            <p>Even ſo, when univerſal Love ſhines in his glory in mankind,
he ſtumbles not, he walks in the light, becauſe the light is in
him; but when the light within with drawes and lets fleſh
ſtand alone, Fleſh, that is, The ſelviſh power will not wait
in peace, and acknowledge himſelf in a loſs and in darkneſs,
till the Sun riſe again:</p>
            <p>But will fain be a God, and calls his weakneſs ſtrength;
and though there appears nothing but deformity, yet he
would have it called beauty; and becauſe his inward power is
not ſutable to his outward profeſſion, he is tormented: he is
a Saint without, but a Devil within: but if thou wouldeſt
have peace, act as thou art, ſhew thy ſelf abroad in action
what thou art ſecretly; but when thou beginſt to imagine a
content and happineſs to thy ſelf, by thy hypocritical ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117691:16"/>
then thou art tormented, or ſhalt be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And by this imagination, mankind tears himſelf in pieces;
as one of your Colonels of the Army ſaid to me,</hi> That the
Diggers did work upon <hi>George Hill</hi> for no other end but to
draw acompany of People into Arms; <hi>and ſayes</hi> our knavery
is found out, becauſe it takes not that effect.</p>
            <p>Truly thou Colonel, I tell thee, Thy knaviſh imagination
is thereby diſcovered, which hinders the effecting of that
Freedom which by Oath and Covenant thou haſt Engaged to
maintain: for my part, and the reſt, we had no ſuch thought;
we abhor fighting for Freedom, it is acting of the Curſe and
lifting him up higher; and do thou uphold it by the Sword,
we will not; we will conquer by Love and Patience, or elſe
we count it no Freedom: Freedom gotten by the Sword is an
eſtabliſhed Bondage to ſome part or other of the Creation;
and this we have Declared publickly enough; therefore thy i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination
told thee a lye, and will deceive thee in a greater
matter, if Love doth not kill him: Victory that is gotten by
the Sword, is a Victory that ſlaves gets one over another; and
hereby <hi>men of the baſeſt Spirit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel) are ſet to
Rule:</hi> but Victory obtained by Love, is a Victory for a
King.</p>
            <p>But by this you may ſee what a liar imagination is, and how
he makes bate, and tears the Creation in pieces; for after that
ſelf Love hath ſubdued others under him, then imagination
ſtudies how to keep himſelf up and keep others down.</p>
            <p>This is your very inward Principle, O ye preſent powers of
<hi>England,</hi> you do not ſtudy how to advance univerſal Love;
if you did, it would appear in action: but imagination and
ſelf-love mightily diſquiets your mind, and makes you call up
all the powers of darkneſſe to come forth and help to ſet the
Crown upon the head of Self, which is that Kinglie power
you have Oathed and Vowed againſt, and yet uphold it in
your hands.</p>
            <p>Imagination begets Covetouſneſſe after pleaſure, honour,
and riches: Covetouſneſſe begets Fear, leaſt others ſhould
croſſe them in their Deſign; or elſe begets a Fear of want,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117691:17"/>
and this makes a man to draw the creatures to him by hook
or crook, and to pleaſe the ſtrongeſt ſide, looking what others
do, not minding what himſelf doth.</p>
            <p>Like ſome of your great Officers, that told me, <hi>That we
Diggers took away other mens Propriety from them, by Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
upon the Common;</hi> yet they have taken mine and other
mens proprietie of money (got by honeſt labour) in Taxes
and free-quarter to advance themſelves and not allow us
that they promiſed us; for it this beam in their own eies they
cannot ſee.</p>
            <p>This Fear begets hypocriſie, ſubtlety, envie, and hardneſs
of heart, which makes a man to break all promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
and to ſeek to ſave himſelf in others ruine, and to
ſuppreſſe and oppreſſe every one that does not ſay as he ſayes,
and do as he does.</p>
            <p>And this hardneſs of heart begets pride and ſecurity, and
this begets luxurie and luſt of the fleſh, and this runs into all
exceſſe with greedines, and being in diſcontent againſt any
that croſſes his pleaſure, till his heart become fully like the
heart of a Beaſt, as it is apparent in ſome at this day.</p>
            <p>And thus by the power of ſelf-love being advanced by the
covetous ſword againſt univerſall love, that power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
riſes up to perfection in mankind, and ſo he makes one
branch to tear and devour another by diviſions, evill ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
envious fightings, and killing, and by oppreſſing the
meek in Spirit, by unrighteous Laws, or by his ſelf will mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
good Laws unrighteouſly, as corrupt Judges know how
to do it, and think none ſees them, whereby part of mankind
hath freedom, and another part is caſt out and thrown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
bondage.</p>
            <p>And all this falling out or quarrelling among mankind, is
about the earth who ſhall, and who ſhall not enjoy it, when
indeed it is the portion of every one, and ought not to be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for, nor bought, nor ſold, whereby ſome are hedged in,
and others hedged out; for better not to have had a body,
then to be debarred the fruit of the Earth to feed and cloth
it; and if every one did but quietly enjoy the earth for food
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117691:17"/>
and raiment, there would be no wars, priſons, nor gallows,
and this action which man calls theft would be no ſin, for
univerſall love never made it a ſin, but the power of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
made that a ſin, and made Laws to puniſh it, though he
himſelf live in that ſin in a higher manner, then he hangs or
puniſheth. Thoſe very men that puniſh others for theft
do theeve and rob, as Judges and Lawyers that take Bribes,
or that takes their Clients money, and through neglect loſe
their cauſe: Parliament and Army lives in Theft, when
as they take the Commoners money, and free-quarter, and
tell them what they do is to make <hi>England</hi> a free Common-Wealth,
and yet all they doe is to make the Gentry free, and
leaves the Commoners under bondage ſtill; or elſe why do
you ſend your Souldiers to beat a few naked Spademen off
from digging the Commons for a livelihood, why do you not
let the oppreſſed go free? have they not bought it of you by
their monies and blood as well as the Gentrie, and will not
you make good your Contract: Well, he that made the earth
for us as well as for you will ſet us free though you will not:
when will the Vail of darknes be drawn off your faces? will
you not be wiſe O yee Rulers?</p>
            <p>Well, this power of darknes is mans fall, or the right time
of mankind.</p>
            <p>But Univerſall love hath declared that he will riſe again,
and he himſelf who is the Seed, will bruiſe that Serpents head,
and reconcile mankind to himſelf again, and reſtore him to
that Innocencie and Peace which he is fallen from. When
this Son ariſes in more ſtrength, and appears to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
indeed, he will then make mankind to be all of one
heart and one mind, and make the Earth to be a common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie,
though for the preſent in outward view there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but darkneſs and confuſion upon the face of the earth,
mankind.</p>
            <p>When ſelf love began to ariſe in the earth, then man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to fall, this is <hi>Adam</hi> or the power of darkneſs that ſtops
up the waters and wel ſprings of life, or the clouds that hide
the Son of righteouſneſs from man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:117691:18"/>
This <hi>Adam</hi> or dark power was ſmall at the firſt, but he is
riſen to great ſtrength, and the whole Earth is now filled
with him, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Darknes hath covered the Earth,</hi>
mankind. For let any that hath eyes look either to them
above or them below, and they ſee darknes or the Devil rule,
and this curſe deſtroys the Earth. The Creation ſits like <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>
ſighing, mourning, and groaning under his oppreſſing
power, and will not be comforted becauſe they ſee no ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to appear for their deliverance.</p>
            <p>Indeed there are many ſaviours in word, but none in deed,
and theſe great falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, does deſtroy
the Creation under the colour of ſaving it, and the people
ſees them not, but looks upon them as ſaviours, calling others
falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets that ſpeak againſt them.</p>
            <p>The firſt falſe chriſt that promiſes to ſave the Creation, is
covetous Kingly power, reſting in the hand of one man, or
in the hand of many, but this power ſaves but part, and holds
another part of the creation in bondage, and any government
that rules by ſwordly power doth ſo throughout all lands;
therefore he is a falſe Chriſt, and no true ſaviour.</p>
            <p>The Preaching Clergie or univerſative power, promiſes to
ſave the Creation declaratively, but he is a falſe Chriſt, he ſaith
and doth not, Phariſee-like, but will force people to maintain
him from the Earth by their labours, for his ſayings, by the
Laws of the Kingly power; he ſaith, ſome are elected to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and others are reprobated; he puts ſome into heaven,
thruſts others into hell never to come out, and ſo he is not a
univerſall Saviour; that is no ſalvation to the creation, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
while any part groans for the true Saviour, when he
comes he will wipe away all teares, he comes not to deſtroy
any but to ſave all.</p>
            <p>Then the power of the Lawyers, he ſaith he will ſave the
Creation, and this falſe Chriſt proves the greateſt devourer
and tearer of the creation of any other, for while he carries
burthened men from one court to another promiſing to ſave
them, he at laſt ſaves himſelf and deſtroyes others, and laughs
at others loſſe, and throwes men further from peace then he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117691:18"/>
found them before he medled with them: Well, From the
Bailiffe to the Judge, theſe are the creations of this Egyptian
Taskmaſter, and no burthen of cheating like to it, for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
Juſtice, but behold nothing but oppreſſion is in his
hands.</p>
            <p>Then next, The Art of buying and ſelling promiſes to ſave
the Creation, and bring it into peace, but this is a hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
falſe cheating chriſt too, for hereby covetous ſelf-love
with his flattering tongue cheats honeſt hearted ones, and
caſts them under tyranny, and gets the fulneſs of the Earth
into his hands, and lock it up in cheſts and barns from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and ſaith this is righteous, and God gave it him, but
thou cheater, thou lieſt; God the King of righteouſneſs gave
it thee not, he bids thee ſell all that thou haſt and give to the
poor, he doth not bid thee lock it up from the poor, therefore
thou trading art, thou art no true ſaviour neither, but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
thou ſaveſt part, and deſtroyeſt another part, yea and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
deſtroyeſt that part which at firſt thou ſeemedſt to
ſave.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe ſaviours are linked together, if one truly fall
all muſt fall, they all promiſe to ſave the Creation, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
is in their hands and actions, they all ſeek to ſet up
ſelf and particular power, and ſo to ſave but part of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for every one are deſtroyers of univerſall love: They that
ſit in theſe ſeats would be called men of publike Spirits, but
truly you are all ſelfiſh, you are afraid to own publike ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
men, nay you are aſhamed ſome of you to be ſeen walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or talking with true publike ſpirited men, called <hi>Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But well, yet there is a promiſe of reſtoration and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the whole creation, and this muſt be wrought by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
contrary to darkneſs, for all thoſe former ſaviours lie under
darkneſs, nay are branches of the power of darkneſs it ſelf,
and darkneſs can never kill darkneſs; but now the true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
muſt be a power quite oppoſite to darkneſs: And this is,</p>
            <p>The power of Univerſall Love, light and righteouſneſs and
if ever the creation be wholly ſaved, this power muſt be the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117691:19"/>
ſaviour, for this is the bleſſing, and he will declare himſelf the
true Saviour indeed, the other is but the curſe, this is the true
reſtorer, the true ſeed with us, as he ariſes and ſpreads, he
will bruiſe the Serpents head in every one, and bring peace to
all, and wipe away all tears from the creation, and make a
through ſalvation of it through the whole earth, and leave
none under bondage.</p>
            <p>This is the Sun of righteouſneſs when he ariſeth, he diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
darkneſs, and will make all aſhamed that had hands in
promoting of the other falſe ſaviours power; but I muſt leave
this, and ſpeak a little more of the preſent condition man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
lies under, and this is darknes or the fall, and in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
ignorant inſlaved ſleſh would ever run round in it, and
never come out, but counts it freedom, but they that know the
burthen of this eſtate hunger after freedom.</p>
            <p>This darknes is twofold, firſt inward, and that is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of darkneſs in his branchs, as covetouſneſs, envy, pride, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
ſelf-love, this is the curſe in man, and this darkneſs
hath and yet doth cover the earth; this power would be as
God, and makes one to rule over another, and he is ſo proud
that he will haſten to rule though he kill others for honour,
and this is he that ſtirs up wars and diſſention, and thereby
he deſtroyes himſelf</p>
            <p>Secondly this inward power ſets one againſt another, and ſo
fills the earth with dark actions, and cauſeth ſome part of
mankind to tread others under foot and puts them into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and they that act this power calls it, The power and
Ordinance of God, which is true: It is God indeed, but it is
the god of the world, the prince of darknes, not the King of
Righteouſneſſe; it is the power of the Beaſt who is limited
to rule for a time, times, and dividing of time, and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is under that dividing of time, therefore I hope, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſhall be the tenth part of the Citie confuſion that ſhall
fall from the Beaſt firſt:</p>
            <p>And this dark power or imaginarie covetouſneſſe hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a platform of oppreſſion in the creation, under which the
creation groans, and waits to be delivered; and it is raiſed
thus,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:117691:19"/>
Firſt this dark power within makes every one to love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with others loſs, juſt like Beaſts of the Field; and this
made mankind to begin to loath or envie each others Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and peace, and hereby the Union and Communion of
Love within is broke and mankind is faln from it: then this
inward Covetouſneſſe makes mankind to fight one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
for the Earth, and breaks Communion in that, and
falls from content therein likewiſe, and every one ſeeks to
ſave himſelf to take the Earth to himſelf, but none or few
ſeeks the things of Chriſt, or of univerſal Love.</p>
            <p>Nay Covetouſneſſe is ſuch a god, that where he Rules he
would have all the Earth to himſelf, and he would have all
to be his ſervants, and his heart ſwels moſt againſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
calling Communitie a thief, that takes other mens
Rights and Proprietie from them, but communitie will force
nothing from any one, but take what is given in love, of that
which others have wrought for; but no man yet hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
any labour upon the Commons that lies waſte; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Diggers doth take no mans proper goods from them
in ſo doing, but thoſe that by force ſpoyls their labours, takes
their proper goods from them, which is the fruit of their
own labours.</p>
            <p>Well, you ſee how Covetouſneſſe would have all the Earth
to himſelf, though he let it lie waſte: he ſtirs up Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, and makes parties fight againſt parties; and all is
but for this, Who ſhall enjoy the Earth, and live in honour
and caſe and rule over others: and the ſtronger party alwayes
rules over the weaker party.</p>
            <p>And hence came in Kingly power to rule outwardly, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
between members of that one body mankind, giving the
Earth to that party called Gentry, who are the Succeſſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs of
ſome late Conqueſts, and denying the Earth to the poor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners
who are the Succeſſors of ſome that were laſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>So that by Kingly power the Earth is divided as it is now at
this day: but as the Scriptures ſay, <hi>Kings were given for a
plague to the people, not a bleſſing:</hi> And I beleeve the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117691:20"/>
have found this very true to their great ſorrow <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and
the way to caſt out Kingly power again, is not to caſt them
out by the Sword, for this doth but ſet him in more power,
and removes him from a weaker to a ſtronger hand: but the
only way to caſt him out, is, For the People to leave him to
himſelf, to forſake fighting and all oppreſſion, and to live in
love one towards another: This power of Love is, the true
Saviour.</p>
            <p>The party that is called a King, was but the head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and he and his Army having Conquered, ſhuts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
out of the Earth, and will not ſuffer them to enjoy it,
but as a ſervant and ſlave to him; and by this power the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is divided, and part are call into bondage; ſo that the
beſt you can ſay of Kingly power that Rules by the Sword is
this, He is a murderer and a theif.</p>
            <p>And by this power the Earth is thus divided.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral Nations of the Earth where Kings rule, are the
ſeveral ſituation of ſuch grand Theeves and Murderers, that
will rule over others by the Sword, upholding a forced Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
which is the Curſe; and perſecuting the community
of Love, which is Chriſt the bleſſing.</p>
            <p>And under them they have their cheif Favourits or neereſt
Souldiers in Office to himſelf, and to theſe he allows the
greateſt portion of the Earth, every one his part, called a
Lordſhip: and next to them the inferior Officers or Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
are appointed out leſſer parcels of the Earth, called free-Holders,
paying no ſlaviſh Rent or Homage to any: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acknowledgment, That the King is their General or Head
ſtill.</p>
            <p>And theſe Lords of Mannors and Free holders having thus
ſeated themſelves in the Earth, by taking other mens proper
labours from them by the Sword, are appointed by the Kiug
as Watchmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if any of the conquered ſlaves ſeek to
Plant the Common waſte Earth without their leave, they
may be known and beaten off: So that the god from whom
they claim Title to the Land as proper to them, ſhutting out
others, was Covetouſneſſe the Murderer, the ſwordly power,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117691:20"/>
that great red Dragon, who is called, The god of the
World.</p>
            <p>But the King of Righteouſneſſe, who is univerſal Love,
who is the Lord God Almighty, bidding every one <hi>do as they
would be done by;</hi> made the Earth for All, without reſpect of
perſon, and ſhuts out none from enjoying a peaceable live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
that hath a body; therefore they that build upon the
power of the Sword, upholding covetous Propriety, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to the law of Righteouſneſſe, which is, <hi>Love your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
do as you would be done by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But one of your Officers told me,</hi> What? (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) If
we grant to every one to have the Land of England in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
we do not only deſtroy Propriety, but we do that which is
not practiſed in any Nation in the world.</p>
            <p>I Anſwered, It was true; Propriety came in you ſee by the
Sword, therefore the Curſe; for the murderer brought it in,
and upholds him by his power, and it makes a diviſion in the
Creation, caſting many under bondage; therefore it is not
the bleſſing, or the promiſed ſeed.</p>
            <p>And what other Lands do, <hi>England</hi> is not to take pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern;
for <hi>England</hi> (as well as other Lands) hath lyen under
the power of that Beaſt, Kingly propriety: But now <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is the firſt of Nations that is upon the point of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and if <hi>England</hi> muſt be the tenth part of the City <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
that fals off from the Beaſt firſt, and would have that
honour, he muſt cheerfully (and dally no longer) caſt out
Kingly covetous Propriety, and ſet the Crown upon Chriſts
head, who is the univerſal Love or Free community, and ſo
be the leader of that happy Reſtoration to all the Nations of
the world: And if <hi>England</hi> refuſe, ſome other Nation may
be choſen before him, and <hi>England</hi> then ſhall loſe his Crown,
for if ever the Creation be Reſtored, this is the way which lies
in this Two fold power:</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Community of Mankind,</hi> which is compriſed in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſpirit of Love, which is called Chriſt in you, or the
Law writen in the heart, leading mankind into all truth, and
to be of one heart and one mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:117691:21"/>
The Second is <hi>Community of the Earth,</hi> for the quiet live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood

one another: Theſe two Communities, or rather one in
two branches, is that true Levelling which Chriſt will work at
his more glorious appearance, for Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of
all men, is the greateſt, firſt, and trueſt Leveller that ever was
ſpoke of in the world.</p>
            <p>Therefore you Rulers of <hi>England,</hi> be not aſhamed nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of Levellers, hate them not, Chriſt comes to you ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon theſe clouds; look not upon other Lands to be
your pattern, all Lands in the world he under darkneſs, ſo
doth <hi>England</hi> yet, though the neereſt to Light and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of any other; therefore let no other Land take your
Crown.</p>
            <p>You have ſet Chriſt upon his throne in <hi>England</hi> by your
Promiſes, Engagements, Oathes, and Two Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the One to caſt out Kingly power; the Other to make
<hi>England</hi> a Free Common-wealth: Put all theſe into ſincere
Action, and you ſhall ſee the work is done, and you with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhall ſing <hi>Halelujah</hi> to him that ſits upon the Throne,
and to the Lamb for evermore.</p>
            <p>But if you do not, the Lamb ſhall ſhew himſelf a Lion, and
tear you in pieces for your moſt abominable diſſembling Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
and give your Land to a People who better deſerves
it: I have varied a little, therefore I will return to what I
was ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I told you,</hi> That the Murdering and Theeving Sword hath
found out a Platform of Tyrannical Government, called King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Power.</p>
            <p>Firſt here is the King, the Head of the murdering power,
or great red Dragon.</p>
            <p>Then there are Lords of Mannors, who have the
greateſt circuit of Land, becauſe the next in Power to the
Head.</p>
            <p>Then there are Free-holders, that took the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures
which they found in a Land when they Conquered it,
and had turned out thoſe that had beſtowed labour upon it,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117691:21"/>
by force of the Sword, in the ſield, or elſe by ſequeſtring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards:
Theſe ſeveral parcels of Land are called Free-hold-Land,
becauſe the Enjoyers or their Anceſtors were Souldiers,
and helped the King to conquer; and if any of latter yeers
came to buy theſe Free-holds with Money got by Trading, it
doth not alter the Title of the Conqueſt; for Evidences are
made in the Kings Name, to remove the Free-holds ſo bought
from one mans hand to another.</p>
            <p>But now Copy-hold lands are parcels hedged in, and taken
out of the common waſte land ſince the conqueſt, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Homage, Fines, and Heriots to the Lord of that Mannor
or circuit in which that Incloſure by his leave is made: this
Homage ſtill confirmes the power of the conqueſts.</p>
            <p>The Lords of Mannors acknowledged Homage to the King
in that Court of Wards, which you have taken away to eaſe
your ſelves.</p>
            <p>But the Copy-holders you will have to acknowledge Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to Lords of Mannors ſtill; and is not this partiality?
O you Rulers, make the poor as free to the Earth as your
ſelves, and honour Righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now for the drawing in of the People to yeeld Obedience
to this Platform of Kingly tyrannical power, to which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are made ſubject through fear,</p>
            <p>The Kingly power ſets up a Preaching Clergy to draw the
People by inſinuating words to conform hereunto, and for
their pains Kingly power gives them the Tithes: And when
the Kingly power hath any Deſign to lift up himſelf higher,
then the Clergy is to Preach up that Deſign, as of late in our
Wars the Preachers moſt commonly in their Sermons medled
with little but State matters: and then if People ſeeme to
deny Tythes, then the Kingly power by his Lawes doth force
the people to pay them: ſo that there is a confederacie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Clergy and the great red Dragon: the Sheep of
Chriſt ſhall never fare well ſo long as the wolf or red Dragon
payes the Shepherd their wages.</p>
            <p>Then next after this, the Kingly power ſets up a Law and
Rule of Government to walk by: and here Juſtice is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117691:22"/>
but the full ſtrength of the Law is to uphold the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Sword, and to preſerve his ſon Propriety: therefore
if any one ſteal, this Law will hang them, and this they ſay
is of God; and ſo this Kingly power hath power over the
lives and labours of men at his pleaſure; for though they ſay
the Law doth puniſh, yet indeed, that Law is but the ſtrength,
life and marrow of the Kingly power, upholding the conqueſt
ſtill, hedging ſome into the Earth, hedging out others; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Earth to ſome, and denying the Earth to others,
which is contrary to the Law of Righteouſneſſe, who made
the Earth at firſt as free for one as for another.</p>
            <p>Yea that Kingly power in the Lawes appointed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
poor to work for them that poſſeſſe the Land, for
three pence and four pence a day, and if any refuſed, they
were to be impriſoned; and if any walked a begging and had
no dwelling, he was to be whipt; and all was to force the
ſlaves to work for them that had taken their Propriety of
their labours from them by the Sword, as the Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
are yet extant, and truly moſt Lawes are but to enſlave
the Poor to the Rich, and ſo they uphold the conqueſt, and
are Lawes of the great red Dragon.</p>
            <p>And at this very day poor people are forced to work in
ſome places for 4, 5, and 6 pence a day; in other places for
8, 10, and 12 pence a day, for ſuch ſmall prizes now Corn
being deer, that their earnings cannot find them bread for
their Family; and yet if they ſteal for maintenance, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Law will hang them; when as Lawyers, Judges, and
Court Officers can take Bribes by whole ſale to remove one
mans Propriety by that Law into another mans hands: and
is not this worſe the every then the poor mans that ſteals for
want? Well, this ſhewes, that if this be Law, it is not the
Law of Righteouſneſſe; it is a Murderer, it is the Law of
Covetouſneſſe and ſelf-love; and this Law that frights people
and forces people to obey it by Priſons, Whips, and Gallows,
is the very kingdom of the Devil, and Darkneſſe, which the
Creation groans under at this day.</p>
            <p>And if any poor enſlaved man that dares not ſteal, begins
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117691:22"/>
to mourn under that bondage and ſaith, We that work moſt
have leaſt comfort in the earth, and they that work not at all,
enjoy all; contrary to the Scripture which ſaith, <hi>The poor and
the meek ſhall inherit the earth.</hi>
            </p>

and made to wait with patience, while the Kingly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſwims in fulneſs, and laughs at the others miſerie; as a
poor Cavalier Gentlewoman preſented a Paper to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
in my ſight, who looked upon the woman with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
countenance; but a brisk little man and two or three more
Colonels puld back the Paper not ſuffering the Generall to

I thought ſaid ſhe, you had not ſate in the ſeat of the
ſcornfull; this was done in <hi>Whitehall</hi> upon the 12. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
1649.</p>
            <p>Well, all that I ſhall ſay to theſe men that will enjoy the
earth in realitie, and tell others they muſt enjoy it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
ſurely your judgement from the moſt High ſleepeth not;
the Law of Retaliation like for like, laughing for laughing
may be your portion, for my part I was alwayes againſt the
Cavaleers cauſe; yet their perſons are part of the Creation
as well as you, and many of them may enter into peace before
ſome of you ſcoffing <hi>Iſhmaelites;</hi> I am ſure you act contrary to
the Scripture which bids you <hi>Love your enemies, and doe as
you would be done by,</hi> and this Scripture you ſay you own;
why then do you not practice it, and doe to the Cavaliers as
the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> bid the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> do to his enemies
whom he had taken priſoners, <hi>Set bread and water</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>before them, and ſend them to their maſter in peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come, make peace with the Cavaliers your enemies, and
let the oppreſſed go free, and let them have a livelihood, and
love your enemies, and doe to them, as you would have had
them done to you if they had conquered you: Well, let them
go in peace, and let love wear the Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:117691:23"/>
For I tell you, and your Preachers, that Scripture whch
ſaith, <hi>The poor ſhall inherit the earth,</hi> is really and material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be fullfilled, for the Earth is to be reſtored from the
bondage of ſword proprietie, and it is to become a common
Treaſurie in reallitie to whole mankind, for this is the work
of the true Saviour to doe, who is the true and faithfull Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
even the Spirit and power of univerſall love, that is
now riſing to ſpread himſelf in the whole creating, who is
the bleſſin, and will ſpread as far as the curſe had ſpred to
take it of, and caſt him out, and who will ſet the creation in
peace.</p>
            <p>This powerfull Saviour will not ſet up his Kingdom nor
rule his Creation with ſword and fighting, as ſome think and
fear, for he hath declared to you long ſince, that they that take
the ſword to ſave themſelves ſhall periſh with the ſword.</p>
            <p>But this ſhall be the way of his conqueſt, even as in the
daies of the Beaſt, the whole world wondred after him, ſet
him up, and was ſubject to him, and did perſecute univerſall
love, and made War againſt him and his Saints, and overcame
them for a time.</p>
            <p>Even ſo the Spirit of love and bleſſing ſhall ariſe and ſpread
in mankind like the Sun from Eaſt to Weſt, and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
power of love, light, and righteouſnes, ſhall let man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
ſee the abomination of the ſwordly Kingly power, and
ſhall loath themſelves in duſt and aſhes, in that they have
owned and upheld him ſo long, and ſhall fall off from him,
loath him and leave him.</p>
            <p>And this ſhall be your miſerie O you covetous oppreſſing
Tyrants of the Earth, not only you great ſelf? ſeeking pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>England,</hi> but you powers of all the World, The peo-ſhall

a great tree that is undermined at the root. And you pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

this falling of is begun already, diviſions ſhall tear and

the people and common Souldiers both lets you alone, but
they laugh in their hearts at you, and yet deſire that you did

            <p>The time is very neer that the people generally ſhall loath
and be aſhamed of your Kingly power, in your preaching, in
your Laws, in your Councels, as now you are aſhamed of the

of Love is the head <hi>Leveller,</hi> and <hi>as he is lifted up, hee
will draw all men after him,</hi> and leave you naked and bare,
and make you aſhamed in your ſelves, his appearance will be

Sufferings that the Diggers
have met with from the great red

which was the firſt day that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Digge, and to take Poſſeſsion
of the Commons for the Poor on
George-Hill in Surrey.</head>
            <p>1. THe firſt time, divers of the Diggers were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Priſoners into <hi>Walton</hi> Church, where ſome
of them were ſtruck in the Church by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Profeſſors and rude Multitude; but after ſome time freed
by a Juſtice.</p>
            <p>2. They were fetched by above a hundred rude people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>John Taylor</hi> was the Leader, who took away their Spades,
and ſome of them they never had again: and carried them firſt
to Priſon at <hi>Walton,</hi> and then to a Juſtice at <hi>Kingſtone,</hi> who
preſently diſmiſſed them.</p>
            <p>3 The Dragonly enemy pulled down a Houſe which the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
had built upon <hi>George-Hill,</hi> and cut their Spades and
Howes to pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:117691:24"/>
4 Two Troops of Horſe were ſent from the General to fetch
us before the Councel of War, to give Account of our Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
            <p>5 We had another Houſe pulled down, and our Spades cut
to pieces.</p>
            <p>6 One of the Diggers had his head ſore wounded, and a Boy
beaten, and his Cloathes taken from him: divers being
by.</p>
            <p>7 We had a Cart and Wheels cut in pieces, and a Mare cut
over the back with a Bill when we went to fetch a Load of
Wood from <hi>Stoak</hi>-Common, to build a Houſe upon <hi>George-Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8 Divers of the Diggers were beaten upon the <hi>Hill,</hi> by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Star</hi> and <hi>John Taylor,</hi> and by men in womens apparel,
and ſo ſore wounded, that ſome of them were fetched home in a
Cart.</p>
            <p>9 We had another Houſe pulled down, and the Wood they
carried to <hi>Walton</hi> in a Cart.</p>
            <p>10 They Arreſted ſome of us, and ſome they caſt into Priſon;
and from others they went about to take away their Goods, but
that the Goods proved another mans, which one of the Diggers
was Servant to.</p>
            <p>11 And indeed at divers times beſides we had all our Corn
ſpoyled; for the Enemy was ſo mad, that they tumbled the
Earth up and down, and would ſuffer no Corn to grow.</p>
            <p>12 Another Cart and Wheels was cut to pieces, and ſome
of our Tooles taken by force from us, which we never had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>13 Some of the Diggers were beaten by the Gentlemen, the
Sheriff looking on, and afterwards Five of them were carried
to <hi>White-Lion</hi> Priſon, and kept there about 5 meeks, and then
let out.</p>
            <p>14 The Sheriff with the Lords of Mannors and Souldiers
ſtanding by, cauſed two or three poor men to pull down
another Houſe: and divers things were ſtoln from them.</p>
            <p>15 The next day two Souldiers and two or three Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſent by Parſon <hi>Platt,</hi> pulled down another Houſe, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117691:25"/>
turned a poor old man and his wife out of doors to lie in the field
in a cold night.</p>
            <p>And this is the laſt hitherto; and ſo you Prieſts as you were
the laſt that had a hand in our perſecution, ſo it may be that

and weaken us.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Souldiery, be not offended, for you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
me in <hi>Whitehal</hi> Gallerie, that you would not meddle
with us, but leave us to the Law of the Land, and the Country
Gentlemen to deal with us, and ſo you did a long time, and
we hope in time that love and patience will conquer our
furious enemies.</p>
            <p>Yet we underſtand which a little troubles us, yet content
That the Generall gave his conſent that the Souldiers ſhould
come to help to beat of the Diggers, and to pull down their
Houſes; it is true, the Souldiers with the Gentlemen our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
came, and cauſed others to pull down our houſes, but
the Souldiers did not meddle, none but one, but expreſſed
ſorrow to ſee the Paſſages.</p>
            <p>But though they were modeſt, and expreſſed tenderneſs, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

the Generals grant and the Soulders preſence was a great
cruſh to our buſineſs; Gentlemen of the Army, we have ſpoke
to you, we have appealed to the Parliament, we have declared
our cauſe with all humilitie to you all, and we are Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and your friends that ſtuck to you in your miſeries, and
theſe Lords of Mannors that oppoſe us were wavering on
both ſides, yet you have heard them, and anſwered their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117691:26"/>
to beat us off, and yet you would not afford us an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Yet love and patience ſhall lie down and ſuffer; Let pride
and covetouſneſs ſtretch themſelves upon their beds of eaſe,
and forget the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and perſecute us for
righteouſneſs ſake, yet we will wait to ſee the iſſue, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of righteouſneſs is our God; the globe runs round, the
longeſt Sun-ſhine day ends in a dark night; and therefore
to thee O thou King of righteouſneſs we doe commit our
cauſe; Judge thou between us and them that ſtrive againſt
us, and thoſe that deal treacherouſly with thee and us, and
doe thine own work, and help weak fleſh in whom the
Spirit is willing.</p>
