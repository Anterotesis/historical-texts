            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Muſt own, it is my Averſion at this time, to meddle with Publick Matters, and yet my Duty to the Publick will not let me be Silent. They that move by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples muſt not regard <hi>Times</hi> nor <hi>Factions,</hi> but what is <hi>juſt,</hi> and what is <hi>honourable</hi>; and that no Man ought to Scruple, nor no Time nor Intereſt to Conteſt.</p>
            <p>The ſingle Queſtion I go upon, and which does immediately concern and exerciſe the Minds of the Thinking, as well as Talking Men of this Kingdom, is, <hi>whether it be fit to repeal the Penal Laws and Tests, in matters of Religion, or not. I</hi> take the Affirmative of the Queſtion, and humbly ſubmit my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to every reaſonable Conſcience. <hi>I</hi> ſay reaſonable, becauſe That which knows not its own Duty, Principles and Intereſt, is not ſo, and That which is not willing to do to others as it would be done by, leſs deſerves to be thought ſo.</p>
            <p>Now there are three ſorts of People that will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerned in this Queſtion; <hi>The Church of England, the Roman Catholick,</hi> and <hi>the Protestant Diſſenter,</hi> and theſe make up the whole Body of the Kingdom; If it appear to be their Duty, Principles and Intereſt, the Queſtion is gain'd, and no body is left to complain; and if I am miſtaken, it is with ſo great an inclination to ſerve them all, that their good nature cannot but plead my Excuſe, eſpecially when they conſider I am neither mov'd by Hopes nor Fears. Private Loſs or Gain being farther from my thought, then I hope they are from a good Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54106:4"/>I ſay, <hi>firſt,</hi> then it is the <hi>Duty</hi> of all of them, becauſe they all profeſs that Religion which makes it their common duty to do it; <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I mean: For no Chriſtian ought to deprive any man of his native Right for matters of Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip towards God, in the way that he thinks moſt agreeable to the Will of God; becauſe it is neceſſary to a Chriſtian to believe that Faith is the Gift of God alone, and that He only is Lord of Conſcience, and is able truly to enlighten, perſwade, and eſtabliſh it; and conſequently that prejudicing Men in their Perſons or Eſtates, or depriving them of any Station in the Government, they might otherwiſe, in their turn, be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſerve the Publick in, is contrary to the tenderneſs and equity of that Religion; which will yet further appear, if we conſider that Chriſtianity is the ſole Religion of the World, that is built on the Principles of Love; which brought with it the greateſt Evidences of Truth. Equally convincing our Underſtandings with its <hi>Light,</hi> and bearing down our Sences with its <hi>Miracles</hi>: Which ſilenc'd the Oracles of the Heathens by the Divine Power preſent with it, and vanquiſht their Hearts, that had left nothing elſe to conquer, leading Kings and Emperors with their Courts and Armies in triumph after the deſpiſed <hi>Croſs</hi> of him, who was the holy and bleſſed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it.</p>
            <p>It was he that laid not his Religion in worldly Empire, nor uſed the Methods of worldly Princes to propagate it; as it came from Heaven, ſo that only ſhould have the Honour of protecting and promoting it. His whole buſineſs to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, from firſt to laſt, was <hi>Love.</hi> 'Twas firſt Love in his Father to ſend him (as St. <hi>John</hi> teaches) <hi>God ſo loved the World that he ſent his Son, &amp;c.</hi> It was love in Jeſus Chriſt to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>come on that Arrand; that he, <hi>who thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, ſhould take the form of a Servant to adopt us Children, and make himſelf of no Reputation with the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54106:4"/>
World, that he might make us of Reputation with God his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he did not only come in much Love, but preach't it and preſt it both to Friends and Foes; <hi>Love one another, Love Enemies, do good to them that hate you, forgive them that treſpaſs againſt you; what you would that other Men ſhould do unto you, do that unto them; by theſe things ſhall all Men know you are my Diſciples; for I came not to deſtroy Mens Lives,</hi> no, not for Religion it ſelf; <hi>for my Kingdom,</hi> Power, Force, Weapons, and Victory <hi>are not of this World.</hi> In all this <hi>Love</hi> prevails. It was his great, his new, his laſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; of all his Diſciples, the moſt perſued by his beloved One, that in his Boſom had learn'd his Heart, as his Divine Doctrine of Love in his Epiſtle tells us.</p>
            <p>As he liv'd in Love, ſo he died in Love, with us, and for us, and that <hi>while we were rebellious too</hi>; ay, he pray'd and dy'd for them who put him to Death, <hi>ſhewing us</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>an Example that we alſo ſhould follow his Steps.</hi> And what are they? doubtleſs the Steps of Love, the Path he trod: To do good to Mankind, Enemies as well as Friends, that we may be like our heavenly Father, <hi>that cauſes his Sun to ſhine, and his Rain to fall upon the Just and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust.</hi> This muſt be the Apoſtles meaning, for the reſt of his Paſſion was Inimitable.</p>

            <p>Chriſt is ſent by his Father for the Salvation of the World: He introduces and proves his Miſſion by Miracles, and the great Authority of his Word and Doctrine; His Followers fully ſatisfied who he was, whence he came, what he taught, and how eminently confirm'd, grew impatient at Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they could not bear the leaſt Diſſent; for when ſome of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> refuſed to entertain their Lord, becauſe they thought he was going for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the place of their greateſt averſion; theſe Diſciples were for having but the Word from his Mouth, and they would, in imitation of <hi>Elijah, have called for Fire from Heaven to have deſtroy'd them. But he turned and rebuked them, and ſaid, ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of, for the Son of Man is not come to Deſtroy Mens Lives but to Save them.</hi> This Anſwer is to purpoſe, and for all times, to be ſure Chriſtian ones; and the higher the Pretentions of any Party are to Chriſtianity, the more inexcuſable if they practice the contrary, Would not Chriſt then hurt them that refuſed him, and can we hurt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors for not receiving us? He condemned that Spirit in his Diſciples, and ſhall we uphold the ſame Spirit, and that by Law too, which he condemned by his Goſpel? This is <hi>killing for Gods ſake,</hi> expreſly charg'd by Chriſt with Impiety. <hi>They ſhall think,</hi> ſays he to his Diſciples, <hi>they do God good ſervice to kill you</hi>; who ſhould think ſo? why <hi>the Chriſtian Perſecutors.</hi> Is it their Property to do ſo? yes, what ſhall one think then of thoſe Chriſtians that profeſs it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were grievouſly puniſhed of God, for that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſacrificing their Children to <hi>Moloch,</hi> but theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

the Sin; <hi>for they offer up Man, Woman and Child,</hi> and tho they ſay 'tis <hi>to God,</hi> no matter for that, ſince it makes their Caſe worſe, for 'tis to imagine that ſo good, ſo juſt, ſo ſenſible, ſo merciful a Beeing can take pleaſure in ſo much Cruelty. Well, <hi>but if we muſt not knock Folks on the Head, what must we do with them</hi>? Take an Anſwer at the Mouth of Truth and Wiſdom. <hi>Let the Tears and Wheat grow together till the Harvest</hi>; whats that? he tells you, <hi>'tis the end of the World</hi>; ſo that whatever the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, 'tis certain Chriſt is for a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Doctrine is always in Faſhion; what he was, he is, and will be; he went not by Reaſons of State, or Cuſtoms of Countries; his Judgment was better built, who came to give Law, and not to receive it, and 'tis a <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> to all times: <hi>And He that loves Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Houſe, or Land better than him,</hi> that is, <hi>his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> (of which this is ſo great a part) <hi>is not worthy of him</hi>; and I fear no other Reaſon induces the Church of <hi>England</hi> to decline it.</p>
            <p>To confirm what has been ſaid, tho I deſign Brevity, let me not loſe another Paſſage very pregnant to our purpoſe; when his Diſciples had accompliſht their firſt Miſſion, at their return they gave him the Hiſtory of their Travels: Among the reſt, they tell him of one they met with, that in his Name caſt out Devils, but becauſe he would not follow with them, <hi>they forbad him</hi>; here is at leaſt a Diſſenting Chriſtian, tho a Believer, yet it ſeems not one of that cloſer Congregation; we alſo ſee their Zeal and Sentence. But what ſays the Maſter, yet alive, and with them, the infallible Doctor, in whoſe Mouth was no Guile, who had not the Spirit by meaſure, and was the great Wiſdom of God to his People, was he of the ſame mind, or did he leave them without rule in the Point? His Anſwer is this. <hi>And</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaid to them, forbid him not, for he that is not against us is for us.</hi> The Prohibition is taken
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54106:6"/>
off, and their Judgment revers'd, and from his, to be ſure, there lies no Appeal. For tho a Power of Deciſion were allow'd to ſome one or more on Earth, in matters obſcure and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, yet in caſes <hi>already adjudged by the Son of God himſelf, who had the Chair, and could not Err,</hi> there can be no room for another Judge.</p>
            <p>Now to apply it, I muſt firſt ſay, I find no ſuch Diſciples among thoſe that are of the ſide of keeping up the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> God knows, the diſparity is but too unequal. But next, if they were all <hi>Twelve</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter Abby,</hi> and ſhould be of the ſide of upholding the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> (which is the wrong ſide they were of before) I ſhould beg their Pardon, if I were of their Maſters mind, and objected his Wiſdom to their Zeal, and his gentle Rule to their harſh and narrow Judgment. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Church of <hi>England</hi> to conſider, that no Pretence can excuſe her Diſſent, and leſs her croſs Practice to the Judgment of her Saviour: <hi>A Judgment that ſeems given and ſetled for the Conduct of the Church on the like Occaſions in ſucceeding times.</hi> And 'tis pitty any worldly thing ſhould have place with her to divert her Obedience. Did Chriſt then come to ſave Mens Lives, and not to deſtroy them? and ſhould ſhe (ſhe I ſay, that pretends to be a reformed Church) uphold thoſe Laws that do deſtroy them? He, Alas! went to another Village inſtead of burning them, or theirs, for refuſing him: And ſhe forbids any, that belongs to any other, to lodge in hers, upon pain of looſing Life or Eſtate; This may make her a <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> indeed; but not the <hi>good One,</hi> whoſe Example would have taught her, inſtead of theſe ſharp and ruder Remedies, to have poured the Oyle of Peace and Gladneſs into thoſe Chops and Wounds that Time and Heats of all Hands had made in every Religious Party of Men. Nor does ſhe loſe anything by repealing thoſe Laws, but the Power of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, and a good Church would never have the Temptation.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54106:6"/>
Come ſome body muſt begin to forgive, let her not leave that Honour to another, nor draw upon her ſelf the Guilt and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of refuſing it. She pretends to fear the Strokes of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> but I would fain know of her, if following their Example will convert them, or ſecure her? Does ſhe hope to keep them out by the Weapons that have fail'd in their Hands, or can ſhe honourably cenſure Perſecution in them, and yet uſe it her ſelf?</p>
            <p>But ſhe is extreamly ſcandal'd and ſcared <hi>at the Severity upon Proteſtants in France.</hi> 'Tis certainly very ill; but do not the Laws ſhe is ſo fond of point at the ſame Work, <hi>Conformity,</hi> or <hi>Ruin.</hi> And don't we know, that in ſome Places, and upon ſome Parties her Magiſtrates have plow'd as deep Furrows, eſpecially within theſe ſix and twenty Years<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Husbands ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Wives, Parents from their Children, the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Bed and the Orphans Milk made a Prize for Religion, Houſes stript, Barns and Fields ſwept clean, Priſons crowded without regard to Sex or Age, and ſome of both ſorts Dungin'd to Death, and all for Religion.</hi> If ſhe ſays they were <hi>peeviſh Men, Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,</hi> or mov'd by <hi>private Intereſt,</hi> ſhe ſtill made the Laws, and ſays no more for her ſelf than the French ſay for their King, which yet ſhe refuſes to take for an Anſwer. Perhaps I could parralel ſome of the ſevereſt Paſſages in that Kingdom out of the Actions of ſome Members of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>cool Blood,</hi> that are even yet for continuing the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> upon their plunder'd Neighbours; ſo that this Reflection of hers upon <hi>France,</hi> is more popular than juſt from her. But I beſeech her to look upon a Country four times bigger than <hi>France; Germany</hi> I mean, and ſhe will there ſee both Religions practis'd with great Eaſe and Amity, yet of this we muſt not hear one Word: <hi>I</hi> hope it is not for fear of imitating it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis diſingenious to object the Miſchiefs of Popery to a general Eaſe, when we ſee it is the way to prevent them.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54106:7"/>
This is but in the name of Popery <hi>to keep all to herſelf,</hi> as well from Proteſtant Diſſenters, as Roman Catholicks. How Chriſtian, how equal, how ſafe, that narrow Method is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes her well to conſider, and methinks ſhe ought not to be long about it.</p>
            <p>I know ſhe flatters herſelf and others to believe, ſhe is a <hi>Bulwork</hi> againſt Popery; and with that, without any further Security to other Proteſtants, wipes her Mouth of all old Scores, and makes her preſent Court for Aſſiſtance. But when that word <hi>Bulwork</hi> is examined, I fear it appears too mean no more than this, <hi>That ſhe would keep out Popery for that reaſon for which ſhe apprehends Popery would turn her out,</hi> viz. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Intereſt.</hi> But may I without Offence ask her, when ſhe kept Perſecution out? Or if ſhe keeps out Popery for any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſake but her own? Nay, if it be not to hold the Power ſhe has in her hands, that ſhe would frighten other Parties (now ſhe has done her worſt) with what miſchief Popery would do them when it has Power. But to ſpeak freely, can ſhe be a Bulwork in the Caſe, that has been bringing the worſt part of Popery in theſe ſix and twenty Years, if <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution be</hi> ſo as ſhe ſays it is? This would be call'd <hi>Canting</hi> to the World in others. But I hear <hi>ſhe begins to ſee her Fault, is heartily ſorry for it, and promiſes to do ſo no more</hi>: And why may not Popery be as wiſe, that has alſo burnt her Fingers with the ſame work? Their praying for eaſe by <hi>Law</hi> looks as if they choſe That rather than <hi>Power</hi> for Security; and if ſo, why may not the Papiſts Live, as well as ſhe Reign? I am none of their Advocate, I am no Papiſt, but I would be juſt and merciful too. However, I muſt tell her, that keeping the Laws on foot, by which ſhe did the miſchief, is none of the plaineſt Evidences of her Repentance: They that can believe it, have little reaſon to quarrel the unaccountableneſs of Tranſubſtantiation. Is it unjuſt in Popery to invade her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54106:7"/>
Priviledges, and can it be juſt in her to provoke it, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtian Liberty? or can ſhe expect what ſhe will not give? or not do as ſhe would be done by, becauſe ſhe fears others will not obſerve the ſame Rule to her? Is not this <hi>doing Evil that Good may come of it,</hi> and that uncertain too, againſt an expreſs Command as well as common Charity? But to ſpeak freely, whether we regard the Circumſtances of the King, the Relation of his Children, the inequality of the Number and Strength of thoſe of each of their Communions, we muſt conclude, that the Averſion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to this intreated Liberty, cannot reaſonably be thought to come from the Fear ſhe has of the prevalency of Popery, but the loſs of that Power the Law gives her to domineer over all Diſſenters. And is not this a <hi>Rare Motive</hi> for a Chriſtian Church to continue Penal Laws for Religion? If her Piety be not able to maintain her upon equal terms, methinks her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much the whip hand and ſtart of all others, ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy her Ambition, and quiet her Fears; for 'tis poſſible for her to keep the Churches if the Laws were aboliſhed; all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, ſhe could not force: She might perſwade and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince what ſhe could: And pray, is not that enough for a true Church, without <hi>Goales, Whips, Halters</hi> and <hi>Gibbets?</hi> O what Corruption is this that has prevail'd over Men of ſuch Pretenſions to Light and Conſcience? that they do not, or will not, ſee nor feel their own Principles one remove from themſelves; but ſacrifice the nobleſt part of the Reformation to Ambition, and compel Men to truckle their tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to the Grandure and Dominion of their Doctors.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> keep at this time, ſuch a ſtir in her favour, and fix her excellency in her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Popery, it is worth while to conſider a little further, if really the moſt feared and diſagreeable part of Popery in her own opinion, does not belong to her, and if it does, ſhould we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54106:8"/>
not be in a fine Condition, to be in Love with our Fetters, and to Court our Miſery?</p>
            <p>That part of <hi>Popery</hi> which the Church of <hi>England</hi> with moſt ſucceſs objects againſt, is her <hi>Violence.</hi> This is that ſhe can only pretend to fear: Her Doctrines ſhe partly Profeſſes or thinks ſhe can eaſily refute. She does not think her Doctors <hi>Conjurers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> for their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or <hi>dangerous</hi> to the State for their <hi>Beads,</hi> or their <hi>Purgatory. But forcing others to their Faith, or ruining them for refuſing it, is the terrible thing we are taught by her to apprehend.</hi> Now granting this to be the caſe, in reference to the Roman Religion, where it is in the Chair: I ask, if the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with her bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Doctrines, has not been Guilty of this Impiety, and for that cauſe more blameable the the Church ſhe oppoſes ſo much? If we look into her Acts of State, we find them many, and bitter, againſt all ſorts of Diſſenters. There is nigh twenty Laws made, and yet in force, to conſtrain Conformity, and they have been executed too, as far and as often as ſhe thought it fit for her Intereſt to let them. <hi>Some have been Hang'd, many Baniſh't, more Impriſoned, and ſome to Death; and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance Impoveriſh't;</hi> and all this meerly for Religion: Tho, by a baſe and barbarous uſe of Words, it has been call'd <hi>Treaſon, Sedition, Routs and Riots</hi>; the worſt of aggravations, ſince they are not contented to make People unhappy for their Diſſent, but rob them of all they had left, <hi>their Innocency.</hi> This has been her State Craft, to coin Guilt, and make men danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to have her ends upon them. But that way of Palliating Perſecution, by rendring a thing that it is not, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men for Crimes they never committed, ſhow but little Conſcience in the Projectors. The Church of <hi>England</hi> crys out againſt Tranſubſtantiation, becauſe of the Inviſibility of the Change. She don't ſee Chriſt there, and therefore he is not there, and yet her Sons do the ſame thing. For tho all the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54106:8"/>
tokens of a Riot are as inviſible in a Diſſenters Meeting, as Chriſt in the Tranſubſtantiation, yet it muſt be a Riot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more to do: The Engliſh of which is, 'tis a Riot to pray to God in the humbleſt and peaceableſt manner in a Conventicle.</p>
            <p>I know it is ſaid, <hi>The Blood-ſhed in the fore-going Raign, and the Plots of the Papiſts againſt Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>drew thoſe Laws from the Church of</hi> England. But this was no reaſon why ſhe ſhould do ill becauſe they had done ſo: Beſides, it may be anſwered, that that Religion having ſo long intermixt it ſelf with worldly Power, it gave way to take the revenges of it. And certainly the great men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> endeavouring <hi>to intercept Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>by proclaiming the Lady</hi> Jane Gray, <hi>and the Apprehenſion the Papiſts had of the better Title of</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of</hi> Scots, <hi>together with a long Poſſeſſion,</hi> were ſcurvy Temptations to kindle ill Deſigns againſt that extraordinary Queen. But tho nothing can excuſe and leſs juſtifie thoſe cruel Proceedings; yet if there were any reaſon for the Laws, it is plainly removed; for the Intereſts are joyn'd, and have been ſince King <hi>James</hi> the firſt came to the Crown. However, 'tis certain there were Laws enough, or they might have had them, to puniſh all civil Enormities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the neceſſity of making any againſt them as Papiſts. And ſo the civil Government had ſtood upon its own Legs, and Vices only againſt it had been puniſhable by it. In ſhort, it was the falſeſt Step that was made in all that great Queens Raign, &amp; the moſt diſhonourable to the Principles of the firſt Reformers, and therefore I know no better Reaſon why it ſhould be continued, than that which made the <hi>Cardinal</hi> in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> oppoſe the Reformation at <hi>Rome</hi>; That tho it was true that they were in the wrong, yet the admitting of it <hi>approved the judgment of their Enemies, and ſo good-night to Infallibility.</hi> Let not this be the Practice of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54106:9"/>
the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>of <hi>England,</hi> and the rather, becauſe ſhe does not pretend to it: But let her reflect, that ſhe has loſt her King from her Religion, and they that have got him, naturally hope for eaſe for theirs by him, that 'tis the end they labour'd, and the great uſe they have for him, and I would fain wonder that ſhe never ſaw it before; but whether ſhe did or no, why ſhould ſhe begrudg it, at leaſt refuſe it now? Since 'tis plain, that there is nothing we eſteem dangerous in Popery that other Laws are not ſufficient to ſecure us from: Have we not enough of them? let her think of more, and do the beſt ſhe can to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Plotters, puniſh Traitors, ſuppreſs the Seditious, and keep the Peace better</hi> than thoſe we have can enable us to do: But, for Gods ſake, let us never direct Laws againſt Men for the cauſe of Religion, or puniſh them before they have otherwiſe done amiſs. Let Mens Works, not their Opinions, turn the Edg of the Magiſtrates Sword againſt them, elſe 'tis Behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them before they are Born.</p>
            <p>By the common Law of this Kingdom there muſt be ſome <hi>Real and Proper Overt Act</hi> that proves Treaſon; ſome <hi>Malice</hi> that proves Sedition; and ſome <hi>violent Action</hi> that proves a Rout or Riot. If ſo, <hi>to call any ſort of Religious Orders,</hi> the one, or <hi>Praying to God in a way out of faſhion,</hi> the other, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtrous, and puniſhing People for it, down right <hi>Murther,</hi> or <hi>Breach of the Peace,</hi> according to the true uſe of Words, and the old Law of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Church of <hi>England</hi> fears the growth of Popery, let her be true to the Religion ſhe owns, and betake her ſelf to <hi>Faith,</hi> rather than <hi>Force,</hi> by a <hi>pious, humble,</hi> and a <hi>good Example</hi>: To <hi>convince</hi> and <hi>perſwade,</hi> which is the higheſt honour to any Church, and the greateſt Victory over Men. I am for a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church as well as ſhe, ſo it be by <hi>Conſent,</hi> and not by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</hi> But Coercive Churches have the <hi>ſame Principle,</hi> tho not the ſame <hi>Interest.</hi> A Church, <hi>by Law eſtabliſhed,</hi> is a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54106:9"/>
State Church, and that is no Argument of Verity, unleſs the State that makes her ſo be infallible; and becauſe that will not be aſſerted, the other can never oblige the Conſcience, and conſequently the Compulſion ſhe uſes, is unreaſonable. This very Principle <hi>juſtifies the King of</hi> France, <hi>and the Inquiſition.</hi> For Laws being equally of Force in all Countries where they are made, it muſt be as much Fault in the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Judgment to be <hi>a Proteſtant at Rome, or a Calvanist at Paris,</hi> as to be a <hi>Papist at London</hi>: Then where is Truth or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but in the Laws of Countries! which renders her an <hi>Hobbist,</hi> notwithſtanding her long and loud Clamours againſt the <hi>Leviathan</hi>:</p>
            <p>I beg her, for the love of Chriſt, that ſhe would think of theſe things, and not eſteem me her Enemy for performing the part of ſo good a Friend. Plain Dealing becomes that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; no matter whether the Way be agreeable, ſo it be right: We are all to do our Duty, and leave the reſt to God: He can beſt anſwer for our Obedience, that Commands it; and our Dependance upon his Word, will be our Security in our Conduct. What weight is it to a Church, that ſhe is <hi>the Church by Law establiſhed,</hi> when no humane Law can make a true Church? A true Church is of <hi>Christs making,</hi> and is by Goſpel eſtabliſhed. 'Tis a Reflection to a Church that would be thought true, to <hi>stoop</hi> to humane Law for her Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have been often ſcandal'd at that Expreſſion from the Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of the Robe, <hi>What do you talk for? our Religion is by Law establiſhed,</hi> as if that determin'd the Queſtion of its Truth againſt all other Perſwaſions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had this to ſay againſt our Saviour, <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to Dye.</hi> The Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſome of our firſt Reformers Dyed <hi>as by Law establiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> if that would mend the matter; but does that make it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54106:10"/>
lawful to a Chriſtian Conſcience? we muſt ever demur to this Plea. No greater Argument of a Churches Defection from Chriſtianity than turning Perſecutor. 'Tis true, the Scripture ſays, <hi>The Earth ſhall help the Woman,</hi> but that was to ſave her ſelf, <hi>not to deſtroy others</hi>: For 'tis the Token that's given by the Holy Ghoſt of a falſe Church; <hi>That none muſt Buy or Sell in her Dominions that will not receive her Mark in their Forehead, or Right-hand.</hi> That is by going to Church againſt Conſcience, or bribing luſtily to ſtay at Home.</p>
            <p>Things don't change, tho men do. Perſecution is ſtill the ſame, let the hand alter never ſo often; but the Sin may not: For doubtleſs it is greateſt in thoſe that make the higheſt claim to Reformation. For while they plead their own Light for doing ſo, they hereby endeavour to <hi>extinguiſh</hi> anothers Light that can't concur. What a Man can't do, <hi>it is not his Fault he don't do, nor ſhould he be compell'd to do it, and at leaſt of all be puniſhed for not doing it. No Church can give Faith, and therefore can't force it; for what is conſtrain'd is not Believed; ſince Faith is in that ſence free, and conſtraint gives no time to aſſent; I ſay, what I don't will is not I, and what I don't Chooſe is none of mine, and anothers can't ſave me, tho it ſhould ſave him.</hi> So that this Method never obtains the end deſign'd, ſince it Saves no body, becauſe it Converts no body; it may breed <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> but that is quite another thing than <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then is the uſe of Penal Laws? only to ſhow the Sincerity of them that Suffer, <hi>and Cruelty of thoſe that make and execute them.</hi> And all time tells us they have ever fail'd thoſe that have lean'd upon them: They have always been looſers at laſt: Beſides, it is a moſt unaccountable obſtinacy in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to ſtickle to uphold them, for after having made it a matter of Religion and Conſcience to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the late King in behalf of this, to think He ſhould leave his Conſcience behind him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or when they waited on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54106:10"/>
him to the Crown, that he ſhould ſend it thither upon a Pilgrimage, is want of wit at beſt, pardon the cenſure. Could they Conſcientiouſly oppoſe his Excluſion for his Religion, and now his Religion becauſe he will not leave it? Or can they reaſonably maintain thoſe <hi>Teſts</hi> that were contrived to exclude him when <hi>Duke of York,</hi> while they endured none to <hi>hinder him from the Crown?</hi> I heartily beg the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> excuſe, if I ſay I can't comprehend her: Perhaps the fault is mine, but ſure I am ſhe is extreamly dark. How could ſhe hope for this King without his Conſcience? or conceive that his Honour or Conſcience would let him leave the Members of his Communion under the laſh of ſo many Deſtroying Laws? would ſhe be ſo ſerv'd by a Prince of her own Religion, and ſhe in the like Circumſtances? She would not, let her talk till Dooms-Day.</p>
            <p>To object <hi>the Kings promiſe,</hi> when he came to the Crown, againſt the repeal of the Penal Laws, ſhows not his Inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but her Uncharitableneſs, or that really ſhe has a very weak place: For it is plain the King <hi>firſt declared</hi> his own Religion, and then <hi>promiſed to maintain hers</hi>; but was that to be without, or together with his own? His Words ſhows he intended that his own ſhould <hi>Live,</hi> tho t'other might <hi>Raign.</hi> I ſay again, it is not credible that a Prince of any Sincerity can refuſe a being to his own Religion, when he continues another in its well being. This were to act upon <hi>State</hi> not <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and to make more Conſcience to uphold a Religion he cannot be of, <hi>than of giving eaſe to one his Conſcience obliges him to be of.</hi> I cannot imagin how <hi>this thought</hi> could enter into any Head that had Brains, or Heart that had Honeſty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And to ſay true, they muſt be a ſort of State Conſciences, <hi>Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as by Law Eſtabliſh'd,</hi> that can follow the Law againſt their Convictions.</p>
            <p>But this is not all I have to obſerve from that objection: It implies too evidently, firſt, that ſhe thinks her ſelf <hi>ſhaken,</hi> if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54106:11"/>
the Penal Laws be repeal'd; then by Law Eſtabliſhed ſhe muſt mean, <hi>Eſtabliſhed by thoſe Penal Laws.</hi> Secondly, that the King having promiſed to maintain her, as by Law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>he ought not to endeavour their Repeal by which ſhe is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</hi> I confeſs this is very cloſe arguing, but then ſhe muſt not take it ill, if all Men think her ill founded; for any thing muſt be ſo, that is eſtabliſhed by deſtroying Laws? Laws, that <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> have declared Enemies to <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Conſcience.</hi> O let her not hold by that Charter, nor Point thither for her Eſtabliſhment and Defence, if ſhe would be thought a Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> had rather one ſhould think there never was ſuch a Man in the World, than that <hi>Plutarch</hi> was an ill Man. Shall the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that glories in a great Light, <hi>be more concern'd for her Power, than her Credit</hi>? To be, than to be that which ſhe ſhould be? I would ſay, far be it from her, for her own ſake, and which is of much more moment, for the ſake of the general Cauſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>Let us ſee therefore if there be not another way of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe Words, more decent to the King, and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for her, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe is in the <hi>National Chair, has the Churches and Revenues, and is Mother of thoſe that do not adhere to any ſeparate Communion, and that the King has promiſed to maintain her in this Poſt from the Invaſions of any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that would wreſt theſe Priviledges out of her hands</hi>: this he promiſed formerly; this he has very particularly repeated in his gracious Declaration: But to Ruin Men that would not Conform, while himſelf was ſo great a Diſſenter, and came ſuch, to her knowledge, to the Crown, can be no part of his Promiſes in the Opinion of common Sence and Charity. Is there no Difference to be obſerved between not turning her out, and deſtroying all others not of her Communion: He will not turn her out, there's his Promiſe, and he has not done
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54106:11"/>
there's his performance: Nor will he do it, am confident, if ſhe pleaſes. But there is no manner of neceſſity from this Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that all Parties elſe are to be Confounded. Tho if it were ſo, 'tis ill Divinity to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs ſuch Promiſes upon a Princes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that can't be perform'd with a good One by Any Body.</p>
            <p>Let her remember how often ſhe has upbraided her Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with this, <hi>Render to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars,</hi> whilſt they have returned upon her t'other half of the Text, <hi>and render unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> It happens now that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> are both of a mind, which perhaps does not alwayes fall out, at leaſt about the Point in hand. Will ſhe Diſſent from both now? Her caſe, believe me, will be doubtful then. I beg her to be Conſiderate. 'Tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt time of Tryal ſhe has met with ſince ſhe was a Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To acquit her ſelf like a Member of Chriſts Univerſal One let her keep nothing that voids her pretentions. The <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Garment will undo her. Practices Inconſiſtant with her Reformation will ruin her. The <hi>Martyrs</hi> Blood Won the Day, and her Severity has almoſt loſt it. They Suffer'd by Law, ſhe makes Laws <hi>for Suffering.</hi> Is this an Immitation of their practice, <hi>to uphold the Weapons of their Deſtruction</hi>? I muſt tell her, 'tis being a <hi>Martyr</hi> for Perſecution, and not by it. Another Path then that the holy Ancients, and our humble Anceſtors trod, and which wll lead her to be deſerted and Contemn'd of every Body that counts it ſafer to follow the Bleſſed Rule and practice of Chriſt and his inſpr'd Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then her narrow and worldly Policies. But that which heighthens the Reproach, is the offer of the Romaniſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make a perpetual civil Peace with her, and that ſhe refuſes, Would the Martyrs have done this? ſurely no. Let her remember the firſt Argument honeſt old <hi>Fox</hi> advances againſt that Church, is the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> preſent Darling, <hi>viz.</hi> Penal Laws for Religion; as ſhe may ſee at the beginning of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54106:12"/>
his firſt Volumn: Doubtleſs he was much in the right, which makes her extreamly in the wrong. Nothing, ſays the Prophet, muſt harm in Gods holy Mountain, and that's the Church ſayes <hi>Fox,</hi> and therefore he ſays, Chriſt's Church never Perſecutes. Leave then God with his own Work, and Chriſt with his own Kingdom. As it is not of the World, let not the World touch it; no, <hi>not to uphold it,</hi> tho they that bear it ſhould trip by the way. Remember <hi>

or Perſecution, for that's the Spirit of Antichriſtianity. Nor for fear of it, ſhould we, of Chriſtians, become Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Where is Faith in God? where is truſt in Providence? let us do our Duty, and leave the reſt with Him; <hi>and not do Evil that Good may come of it</hi>; for that ſhows a Diſtruſt in God, and a Confidence in our own Inventions for ſecurity. No reaſon of State can excuſe our Diſobedience to his <hi>Rule</hi>; and we deſert the Principles of our heavenly Maſter when we decline it. The Queſtion is about Conſcience, about this we can none of us be too tender nor exemplary. 'Tis in right doing that Chriſtians can hope for Succeſs; and for true Victory only through Faith and Patience. But if to avoid what we fear, we contradict our Principles, we may juſtly apprehend <hi>that God will deſert us in an unlawful way of maintaining them.</hi> Perhaps this may be Gods time of trying all Parties, what we will do; whether we well rely upon him or our own feeble Proviſions; whether we will allow what we our ſelves in our turn <hi>have all of us deſired</hi>; if not, may we not expect to ſuffer the thing we would inflict? for our <hi>Penal Laws</hi> cannot ſecure us from the turns of Providence, and leſs ſupport us under them. Let us conſider the true ground of the difficulty that is made, if it be not partial and light in Gods Scale; for to that tryal all things muſt come, and his Judgment is inevitable as well as infallible. Beſides, if we have not tryed all other methods, we are inexcuſable in being ſo tenacious for this. I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in all humility, beſeech all ſorts of Profeſſors of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in theſe Kingdoms, to abſtract themſelves from thoſe Jealouſies which worldly motives are apt to kindle in their Minds, and with an even and undiſturbed Soul purſue their Chriſtian Duty in this great Conjuncture: Conſidering <hi>the Race is not to the Swife, nor the Battle to the Strong,</hi> and that for all our Watchmen, <hi>'tis God alone</hi> (at laſt) <hi>that keeps the City.</hi> Not that I would decline a fitting, but an unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

            <p>I could yet Enlarge upon this Subject; for nothing can be more fruitful. I could ſay, that a Church that <hi>Denies</hi> Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, cannot <hi>force,</hi> becauſe ſhe cannot be <hi>certain,</hi> and ſo <hi>Penal Laws</hi> (tho it were poſſible that they could be lawful in others) in her, <hi>would be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt.</hi> That Scripture leaves Men to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> and <hi>Perſwaſion.</hi> That the true Chruch-Weapons are <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi>; and her puniſhments, <hi>Cenſure</hi> and <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</hi> That <hi>Goals</hi> and <hi>Gibbets</hi> are Inadiquated Methods for Converſion, and that they never <hi>ſucceeded.</hi> That this <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids</hi> all further light to come into the World, and ſo <hi>limits</hi> the Holy One, which in Scripture is made a great Sin.

This Story ſhe muſt hear of ſome way, and I pray God ſhe may endeavour to do her duty in it. She is not alone; for every Party in Power has too evidently lapſt into this Evil; tho under the prevalency and perſecution of another Intereſt they have ever writ againſt club Law for Religion. And to the end that I may do the Reformation Right, and the Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Juſtice, I muſt ſay, that hardly one perſon of any note, dyed in the time of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> that did not paſs Sentance upon Perſecution as Antichriſtian, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Latimer, Philpot, Bradford, Rogers,</hi> very Eminent Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

But what need we go ſo far back? is it not recent in memory, that <hi>Biſhop <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> was Employ'd to <hi>O.

            <p>Certainly thoſe Gentlemen were of my mind.

            </p>
            <p>One can eaſily imagin this to be Reformation Language, and then it is not hard to think how low that Church muſt be fallen, that from ſo free and excellent a Principle, is come to make, execute and uphold <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for Religion, againſt her Conſcientious Neighbours; but it is to be hoped, that like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's Image,</hi> whoſe Feet was a mixture of <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay,</hi> and therefore could not ſtand for ever; Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution will not be able to mix ſo with the Seed of Men but that Humanity will overcome it, and Mankind one day be delivered from that Iron hard and fierce Nature.</p>
            <p>I have done with my Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Evidences againſt Perſecution. And for the Judgment of all ſorts of Diſſenters in that Point, let their Practice have been what it will, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is clearer than that they diſallow of Perſecution, of which their daily Addreſſes of Thanks to the King, for his General Eaſe by his Excellent Declaration are an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Proof.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee it is evident, that it is not only the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all Parties, as they would be thought Chriſtians, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for Religion, but upon a fair enquiry, we ſee it is the avowed Principle of every Party at one time or other that Conſcience ought not to be compel'd, nor Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impos'd upon worldly Penalties. And ſo <hi>I</hi> come to the third and laſt part of this Diſcourſe.</p>

            <head>PART III. It is the Intereſt of all Parties, and eſpecially the Church of England.</head>
            <p>AS I take all Men to be unwillingly ſeparated from their Intereſts, and conſequently ought only to be ſought and diſcours'd in them, ſo it muſt be granted me on all hands, that Intereſts <hi>change</hi> as well as Times, and 'tis the Wiſdom of a Man to <hi>obſerve</hi> the Courſes, and <hi>humor</hi> the Motions of his Intereſt, as the beſt way to preſerve it. And leaſt any ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd or miſtaken Perſon ſhould call it temporizing, I make this early Proviſion; That I mean no immorral or corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance: A <hi>Temporizing,</hi> deſervedly baſe with Men of Vertue, and which in all times, my Practice as well as Judgment hath ſhown the laſt Averſion to. For upon the Principle I now go, and which I lay down, as common and granted in Reaſon and Fact with all Parties concern'd in this Diſcourſe, that Man, does not change, that <hi>morrally</hi> follows his Intereſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all its Revolutions, becauſe to be true to his Intereſt is his firſt civil Principle. I premiſe this to introduce what I have to offer, with reſpect to the Intereſts to be now treated upon.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I ſay, I take it to be the Intereſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to aboliſh the <hi>Penal Laws, becauſe it never was her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to make them.</hi> My reaſons for that Opinion are theſe. Firſt, they have been an Argument to invalidate the Sufferings of the Reformers, becauſe if it be unlawful to diſobey Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about matters of Religion they were in the wrong. And if they ſay, O but they were in Error that puniſh'd their Non-conformity; I anſwer, how can ſhe prove that ſhe is Infallibly in the Right? And if this cannot be done, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54106:22"/>
to an uncertainty upon the ſame terms. <hi>Secondly,</hi> She has overthrown the Principles upon which ſhe ſeparated from <hi>Rome.</hi> For if it be unlawful to plead Scripture and Conſcience to vindicate Diſſent from her Communion, it was unlawful for her upon the ſame Plea to diſſent from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unleſs ſhe will ſay again, that ſhe was in the Right, but the other in the Wrong, and ſhe knows this is no Anſwer, but a begging of the Queſtion; for they that ſeparate from her, think themſelves as Serious, Devout, and as much in the Right as ſhe could do. If then <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the beſt <hi>Light</hi> ſhe had, were the ground of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſhe muſt allow the Liberty ſhe takes, <hi>or ſhe eats her Words, and ſubverts her Foundation</hi>; then which nothing can be more deſtructive to the Intereſt of any Beeing, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Penal Laws</hi> have been the great <hi>Make-bate</hi> in the Kingdom from the beginning. For if I ſhould grant that ſhe had once been truly the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I mean, conſiſting of all the People of <hi>England,</hi> (which ſhe was not, for there were divers Parties diſſenting from the firſt of her eſtabliſhment) yet ſince it afterwards appear'd ſhe was but one Party tho the biggeſt, ſhe ought not to have made her Power more National than her Faith, nor her Faith ſo by the Force of her Temporal Authority. 'Tis true ſhe got the Magiſtrate of her ſide, but ſhe engaged him too far. For ſhe knew Chriſt did not leave <hi>Caeſar Executor</hi> to his laſt Will and Teſtament, and that that ſhould be the reaſon why ſhe did ſo, was none of the beſt <hi>Ornament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to her Reformation. That ſhe was but a Party, tho the biggeſt, by the Advantages that temporal Power brought her, I ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, but I will introduce it with a ſhort Account of our State-Reformation here in <hi>England,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> was a kind of <hi>Hermophredite</hi> in Religion, or in the Language of the times, a <hi>Trimmer</hi>; being a meddly of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54106:22"/>
Papiſt and Proteſtant, and that part he acted to the Life, or to the Death rather; Sacrificing on the ſame Day Men of both Religions, becauſe one was not Proteſtant enough, and t'other Papiſt enough for him. In this time were ſome <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> for the diſtinction of Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi> was not then known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward the Sixth</hi> ſucceeded, a Prince that promiſed Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that might more than ballance the Exceſſes of his Father, and yet by <hi>Arch-Biſhop Cranmer,</hi> was compelled to ſign a Warrant to Burn poor <hi>Joan of Kent,</hi> a famous Woman, but counted an Enthuſiaſt: But to prove what I ſaid of him, 'twas not without frequent Denials and Tears, and the Biſhop ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon him to anſwer for it at Gods Judgment; of which I hope his Soul was diſcharged, tho his Body, by the ſame Law, ſuffered the ſame Puniſhment in the ſucceeding Reign. Thus even the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> begun with Blood for meer Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and taught the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> in ſucceeding times, how to deal with them.</p>
            <p>At this time the Controverſie grew warm between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Calvaniſts,</hi> that were the Abler Preachers and the Better Livers. The Biſhops being moſtly men of State, and ſome of them looking rather backward then forward, Witneſs the Difficulty the King had to get <hi>Hooper</hi> Conſecrated Biſhop, without Conformity to the reſerved Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queen Mary</hi> came in, and ended the Quarrel at the Stake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now <hi>Ridly</hi> and <hi>Hooper</hi> hug, and are the deareſt Brethren and beſt Friends in the World. <hi>Hooper</hi> keeps his Ground, and <hi>Ridly</hi> ſtoops with his Ceremonies to t'others further Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But this Light and Union <hi>flow'd</hi> from their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: For thoſe abroad at <hi>Frankford,</hi> and other places were not upon ſo good Terms: Their Fewds grew ſo great that the one refuſed Communion with the other, many endeavours
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54106:23"/>
were uſed to quench the Fire, but they were ineffectual; at beſt it lay under the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of their Affliction for another time; for no ſooner was <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> upon her Throne then they returned, and their Difference with them. They managed it civilly for a while, but Ambition in ſome, and Covetouſneſs in others on the one hand, and Diſcretion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to Reſentment on the other, they firſt ply the <hi>Queen</hi> and her Miniſters, and when that ended in favour of the <hi>Men of Ceremony,</hi> the others arraigned them before the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers abroad, at <hi>Geneva, Bazil, Zurich, &amp;c.</hi> The leading Prelates by their Letters, as Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi> lately tells us, in his Printed Relation of his Travels, clear themſelves to thoſe firſt Doctors of any ſuch Imputation, and lay all upon the Queen, who for Reaſons of State would not be brough to ſo Inceremonious a way of Worſhip as that of the <hi>Calvaniſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time there were <hi>Papiſts, Protestants, Evangeliſts, Praeciſians, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitiſts, Familiſts</hi> or <hi>Enthuſiasts</hi> and <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi>; when the very firſt Year of her Reign, a Law for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in Worſhip and Diſcipline</hi> was enacted, and more followed of the ſevereſt Nature, and ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted. Thus then we ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there never was ſuch a thing as a Church of <hi>England</hi> ſince the Days of <hi>Popery,</hi> that is, a Church of Communion containing all the People of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo cannot be ſaid to be ſo much as a <hi>Twin</hi> of the Reformation; nevertheleſs ſhe got the Bleſſing of the Civil Magiſtrate. She made him great to be great by him: If She might be the <hi>Church,</hi> He ſhould be the <hi>Head.</hi> Much good may the <hi>Bargain</hi> do her. Now is the time for her to <hi>stand</hi> to her Principle. I never knew any body exceed their Bounds that were not <hi>met with at last.</hi> If we could eſcape Men, God we cannot, his Providence will overtake us, and find us out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:54106:23"/>By all this then it appearing, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not the Nation, the Caſe is plain that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> were a <hi>Make-bate,</hi> for they Sacrificed every ſort of People whoſe Conſciences differed from the Church of <hi>England</hi>; which firſt put the <hi>Romaniſt</hi> upon flattering Prerogative, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its Shelter from the wrath of thoſe Laws. The Addreſs could not be unpleaſant to Princes; and we ſee it was not; for <hi>King James,</hi> that came in with Invectives againſt Popery, entring the Liſt with the Learn'd of that Church, and charging her with all the Marks the <hi>Revelation</hi> gives to that of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> grew at laſt ſo tame and eaſy towards the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> that our own Story tells us of the Fears of the encreaſe of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> in the latter Parliament of his Reign.</p>
            <p>In <hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt's time, no body can doubt of the Complaint, becauſe that was in great meaſure the drift of every Parliament, and at laſt one Reaſon of the War. On the other hand the <hi>Severity</hi> of the Biſhops againſt Men of their own Principles, and in the main, of their own Communion, either becauſe they were more zealous in Preaching, more followed of the People, or could not wear ſome odd Garment, and leſs, lead the Dance on a Lords Day at a Maypole, (the Relique of <hi>Flora</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Strumpet) or perhaps for rubbing upon the Ambition, Covetouſneſs and Lazineſs of the Dignified, and Ignorance and Looſneſs of the ordinary Clergy of the Church (of which I could produce Five hundred groſs Inſtances) I ſay theſe things breed bad Blood, and in part, gave begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to thoſe Animoſities, that at laſt broke forth, with ſome other Pretences into áll thoſe National Troubles that agitated this poor Kingdom for Ten Years together, in which the Church of <hi>England</hi> became the greateſt Looſer, Her Clergy turn'd out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her Nobility and Gentry Sequeſtred, Decimated, Impriſoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whatever ſhe is pleaſed to think, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is truer, then that her <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and Conduct in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54106:24"/>
               <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and <hi>high Commiſſion Court</hi> in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was her overthrow.</p>
            <p>'Tis as evident, the ſame Humour ſince the Reſtoration of the late King, has had almoſt the ſame Effect. For nothing was grown ſo little and contemptible as the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in this Kingdom ſhe now intitles her ſelf the Church of: Witneſs the Elections of the laſt three Parliaments before this, I know it may be ſaid the Perſons choſen were Church goers; I confeſs it, for the Law would have them ſo. But no body were more avers to the Politicks of the Clergy; inſomuch that the Parſon and the Pariſh almoſt every where divided upon the queſtion of their Election. In truth, it has been the <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Countenence</hi> of the Crown, and not her intrinſick Intereſt or Value, that has kept her up to this Day; elſe her <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> the <hi>Bulwork</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the ſame figure, than ſhe is one againſt Popery, had ſunk her long ſince.</p>
            <p>I hope I may, by this time, conclude, without offence, that the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> have been a <hi>Make-bate</hi> in the great Family of the Kingdom, ſetting the Father againſt his Children, and Brethren againſt Brethren; not only giving the Empire to one, but endeavouring to extinguiſh the reſt, and that for this the Church of <hi>England</hi> has once paid a ſevere Reckoning. I apply it thus: Is it not her Intereſt to be careful ſhe does it not a ſecond time? ſhe has a fair Opportunity to prevent it, and keep her ſelf where ſhe is, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Publick <hi>Religion</hi> of the Country, with the real Maintenance of it; which is a plain preference to all the reſt. If ſhe hopes by her Averſion to a general Eaſe, to ſet up for a <hi>Bulwork</hi> againſt Popery, one Year will ſhow the trick, and mightily deceive her, and the Oppertunity will be loſt, and another Bargain driven, I dare aſſure her, mightily to her Diſadvantage. Violence and Tyranny are no natural Conſequences of Popery, for then they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54106:24"/>
would follow every where, and in all places and times alike. But we ſee in twenty Governments in <hi>Germany</hi> there is none for Religion, nor was not for an Age in <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>Poland,</hi> the Popiſh Cantons of <hi>Switzerland, Venice, Lucca, Colonia, &amp;c.</hi> where that Religion is Dominant, the People enjoy their Ancient and Civil Rights a little more ſteadily than they have of late time done in ſome Proteſtant Countries nearer home, almoſt ever ſince the Reformation. Is this againſt Proteſtancy? No, but very much againſt Proteſtants, For had they been true to their Principles, we had been upon better Terms. So that the Reformation was not the Fault, but not keeping to it better than ſome have done; For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they were <hi>Papiſts</hi> that both obtain'd the <hi>Great Charter</hi> and <hi>Charter of Foreſts,</hi> and in the ſucceſſive Reigns of the Kings of their Religion, Induſtriouſly laboured the Confirmation of them, as the great <hi>Text</hi> of their Liberties and Properties, by above thirty other Laws; we find almoſt an equal Number to Deſtroy them, and but one made in their Favour ſince the Reformation, and that ſhrowdly againſt the will of the high Church-men too; I mean <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> in the third Year of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt. In ſhort, They deſire a legal Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with us, and we are afraid of it, leaſt it ſhould inſecure us; when nothing can do it ſo certainly as their Inſecurity, for Safety makes no Man Deſparate. And he that ſeeks eaſe by Law, therefore does it, becauſe he would not attempt it by Force. Are we afraid of their Power and yet provoke it? If this Jealouſie and Averſion prevail, it may drive her to a Bargain with the Kingdom for ſuch general Redemption of Property, as may deſolve our great Corporation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and then ſhe will think that half a Loaf had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than no Bread, and that it had been more adviſable to have <hi>parted</hi> with <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> that only ſerv'd to dreſs her in Satyr, then have loſt all for keeping them; eſpecially, when it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54106:25"/>
was but parting with <hi>Spurs, Claws</hi> and <hi>Bills</hi> that made her look more like a <hi>Vulter</hi> than a <hi>Dove,</hi> and a <hi>Lion</hi> than a <hi>Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I proceed to my next Reaſon, why it is her Intereſt to Repeal thoſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> (tho a greater cannot be advanced to Men than <hi>ſelf Preſervation</hi>) and that is, <hi>That ſhe elſe breaks with a King heartily inclin'd to preſerve her by any way that is not Perſecuting,</hi> and whoſe Intereſt ſhe once perſu'd at all Adventures, when more than ſhe ſees was ſuggeſted to her by the Men of the Intereſt ſhe oppoſed in favour of his Claim. What then has befallen her, that ſhe changes the courſe ſhe took with ſuch reſolutions of perſeverance? for bringing him to the Crown with this Religion, could not be more her Duty to his Title, or her Intereſt to ſupport her own, than it is ſtill, to be fair with him. If ſhe ow'd the one to him and to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, ſhe is not leſs indebted to her ſelf the other. Does he ſeek to impoſe his own Religion upon her? By no means. There is no body would abhor the Attempt, or, at all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, condemn it more than my ſelf. What then is the matter? why he deſires eaſe for his Religion, ſhe does not think fit to conſider him in this, (no not to the King ſhe brought with this Objection to the Crown) Certainly ſhe is much in the wrong, and ſhews her ſelf an ill Courtier (tho it was become her calling) firſt to give him Roaſt-meat, then beat him with the Spit. Is not this to quit thoſe high Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Loyalty and Chriſtianity ſhe valued her ſelf once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what ſhe can, provoke the Miſchiefs ſhe fears? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is dividing in Judgment from him that ſhe has ackowledged to be her <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My fifth Reaſon is, that as the making and executing the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> for Religion affects all the ſeveral Parties of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters as well as the Papiſts (the Judges in <hi>Vaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>'s time, and he at the Head of them, giving it as their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54106:25"/>
they were equally expoſed to thoſe Laws) and that are thereby naturally driven into an Intereſt with them; ſo it is at this time greatly the Prudence of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to repeal them, for by ſo doing ſhe divides the Intereſt that ſelf Preſervation allows all Men to perſue, that are united by danger: And ſince ſhe is aſſured the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhall not have the leſs Eaſe in this King's time than if the Laws were Repeal'd, and that her Fears are not of the ſucceeding Raigns, how is their Repeal a great Inſecurity, eſpecially, when by that, ſhe draws into her Intereſt all the Proteſtant Diſſenters, that are abundantly more conſiderable than the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and that are as unwilling that Popery ſhould be <hi>National</hi> as her ſelf. For if this be not granted, ſee what Reputation follows to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> She tells the King ſhe does not deſire his Friends ſhould be perſecuted, yet the forbearance muſt not be by <hi>Declaration</hi> to ſave the Government, nor by <hi>Law</hi> to ſave her; and without one of theſe Warrants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and Officer in <hi>England</hi> is Perjured that ſuffers them in that Liberty againſt Law. How can ſhe be ſincerely willing that ſhould be done, that ſhe is not willing ſhould be done <hi>legally</hi>?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Sixthly,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not know but they or ſome other Party may at one time or other prevail. It ſeems to me her Intereſt to ſet a good Example, and ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak eaſie Terms for her ſelf. I know of none intended, and believe no body but her ſelf can place her ſo low, yet if it were her unhappineſs, I think to have civil Property ſecur'd out of the Queſtion of Religion, and Conſtraint upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience prevented by a Glorious <hi>Magna Charta for the liberty of it,</hi> were not a thing of ill Conſequence to her Intereſt. Let us but conſider what other Princes did for their own Religion, within the laſt ſeven Raigns, when they came to the Crown, and we cannot think ſo ſoft and equal a thing as an impartial
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54106:26"/>
Liberty of Conſcience, after all that has been ſaid of a Popiſh Succeſſor, an ordinary Caracter of a Prince, or a mean Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to us: This ought not to ſlip her Reflection. Beſides, there is ſome care due to Poſterity: Tho the preſent Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of her Communion may eſcape the Temptation, their Children may not: They may <hi>change</hi> the Religion of their Education, and Conſcientiouſly chuſe ſome other Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Would they ſubmit the <hi>Fortunes</hi> they leave them to the Rape of hungry <hi>Courtiers, Biggots and indigent Informers,</hi> or have their poor Poſterity <hi>Impoveriſht, Baniſht</hi> or <hi>Executed</hi> for Sober and Religious Diſſent? God knows into whoſe hands theſe Laws at laſt may fall, what Miſchief they may do, and to whom. Believe me, a King of the humor of Sr <hi>J.K.</hi> of the <hi>West,</hi> or Sr <hi>W.A.</hi> of <hi>Reading,</hi> or Sr <hi>R.B.</hi> or Sr <hi>S.S.</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> would, with ſuch vouchers, quickly make a <hi>Golgatha</hi> of the Kingdom. If ſhe thinks her ſelf conſiderable in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or Eſtate, ſhe will have the more to looſe. Let her not therefore eſtabliſh that in the Prejudice of others, that may in the hands of others turn to her Prejudice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I would not have her miſs the advantage that is deſign'd her by thoſe that perhaps ſhe thinks worſt of. I dare ſay no body would willingly ſee the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in her <hi>Chair,</hi> and yet that may happen to be the Conſequence of her Tenaciouſneſs in a little time. For if the Averſion her Sons promote by whole ſale againſt <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould prevail, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of it in her ſelf are not like to eſcape that Reformation: I mean, her <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of her Worſhip, for which ſhe has vext the moſt Conſciencious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Kingdom above an Age paſt. And the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> being a Rich, Induſtrious and Numerous Party, as well among the Nobility and Gentry, as Trading and Country People, I cannot ſee but the next Motion, naturally ſpeaking, is like to tend that way; for other Parties, however well
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54106:26"/>
eſteemed may ſeem too great a ſtep of Reformation at once, and methinks ſhe has taſted enough of that <hi>Regiment,</hi> to be once wiſe, and keep the <hi>Ballance</hi> in her own Hands. And certain it is, that nothing will ſo effectually do this as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Liberty of Conſcience; for then there will be four Parties of Diſſenters beſides her ſelf, to <hi>Ballance</hi> againſt any Deſigns that may <hi>warp</hi> or <hi>byaſs</hi> things to their Advancement. And that which ought to induce the Church of <hi>England</hi> not a little to haſten, as well as do the thing, is this; ſhe is now a ſort of National Church by <hi>Power,</hi> ſhe will then be the Publick Church by Concurrence of all Parties. Inſtead of Enemies to invade or undermine her, they that ſhould do it are made the Friends of her ſafety by the happineſs they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy through her complacency: And if any ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural or ungrateful to her, the Intereſt of the reſt will oblige them to be her <hi>Spys</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> againſt the Ambition of any ſuch Party. I do heartily pray to God that he would <hi>enlighten the Eyes of her Leaders,</hi> and give them good Hearts too, that <hi>Faction</hi> may not prevail againſt Charity, in the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And above all, that ſhe would not be proud of her Numbers, or ſtand off upon that Reflection; for that alone will quickly leſſen them in a Nation loving Freedom as much as this we live in; And what appears in the Town is an ill Glaſs to take a proſpect of the Country by: There are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes that have Fifteen Thouſand Souls in them and if two come to Church it is matter of Brag, tho half the reſt be ſown among the ſeveral diſſenting Congregations of their Judgment. I would not have her miſtaken, tho <hi>Popery</hi> be an Unpopular thing, 'tis as certain ſhe of a long time has not been Popular, and on that Principle never can be: And if ſhe ſhould Plow with that Heifer now, and gain a little by the Averſion to Popery; when it is diſcern'd that Popery does return to the civil Intereſt of the Kingdom they will quickly be

Friends. For beſides that we are the eaſieſt and beſt natur'd People in the World to be appeas'd, there are thoſe charms in Liberty and Property to Engliſh Nature that no endeavours can reſiſt or diſapoint. And can we reaſonably think the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts will be wanting in that, when they ſee it is their own (and perhaps their only) Intereſt to do ſo? Theſe are the Arguments which, I confeſs, have prevailed with me to importune the Church of <hi>England</hi> to yeild to the Repeal of all the Penal Statutes, and I ſhould be glad to ſee them either well refuted or ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now <hi>Address</hi> my ſelf to thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and hope to make it appear it is their Intereſt to ſit down thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> herein deſired, and that a <hi>Toleration and no more,</hi> is that which all <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ought to be ſatisfied with. My Reaſons are theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that Popery every where finds: For in nothing is the Kingdom ſo much of a mind as in this Averſion: 'Tis no news, and ſo may be the better ſaid and taken. I ſay then this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> and this <hi>Viſibility</hi> againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, make the attempt, for <hi>more</hi> then Liberty of Conſcience, too great and Dangerous. I believe there may be ſome poor <hi>ſilly Biggots</hi> that hope bigger, and talk further, but who can help that? there are weak People of all ſides, and they will be making a Pudder: But what's the <hi>language of their true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> the Infallible guide of the wiſer Men? <hi>Safety</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and that in ſucceeding Raigns to chuſe: And if ſo, their Steps muſt be modeſt, for they are Watcht and Number'd. And tho their Prudence ſhould ſubmit to their Zeal, both muſt yeild to Neceſſity, whether they like it or no. What they convert upon the Square, <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> I mean, is their own, and much good may it do them. But the fear is not of this, and for compelling the avers <hi>Genius</hi> of the Kingdom, <hi>they have not the means,</hi> what ever they would do if they had them:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54106:27"/>
Which is my ſecond Reaſon. I ſay <hi>they have not the Power,</hi> and that is what we apprehend moſt. There are three things that prove this in my Opinion. Firſt, <hi>their want of Hands,</hi> next, <hi>want of Time,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>their Inteſtine Diviſion</hi>; which, whatever we think, is not inconſiderable. They are <hi>few,</hi> we muſt all agree, to the Kingdom, upon the beſt Computation that could be made. Out of eight Millions of People, they are not <hi>Thirty thouſand,</hi> and thoſe but thinly ſown up and down the Nation; by which it appears that the Diſproportion of the <hi>natural</hi> ſtrength is not leſs than two hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Perſons to one. So that Popery in <hi>England</hi> is like a <hi>Spirit without a Body,</hi> or a General without an Army. It can hurt no more than Bullets without Powder, or a Sword and no Hand to uſe it. I dare ſay, there is not of that Communion, enough at once, to make all the Coal Fires in <hi>London,</hi> and yet we are apprehenſive they are able to conſume the whole Kingdom. I am ſtill more <hi>afraid of her Fears</hi> than of them; for tho they ſeem high, ſhe thinks their Religion in no Reign has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared much lower.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O but they have the King of their Side, and he has the Executive Power in his Hands</hi>! True, and this I call the <hi>Artificial</hi> Strength of the Kingdom. But I ſay, firſt we have his Word to bind him. And tho ſome may think our Kings cannot be tyed by their People, certainly they may be tyed by themſelves. What if I don't look upon the Act of both Houſes to oblige the King, his own Conceſſion muſt; and that may be given in an Act of State I take the King to be as well obliged in Honour and Conſcience to what he promiſes his People in another Method, as if it had been by his Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in Parliament; for an honeſt mans Word is good every where, and why a Kings ſhould not I can't tell. 'Tis true, the Place differs and the Voice comes with greater Solemnity, but why it ſhould with greater Truth I know not. And if
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54106:28"/>
the <hi>Church of England</hi> will but be adviſed to give him the opportunity of keeping his repeated Word with her, and not deprive her ſelf of that advantage by Jealouſies and Diſtances that make her ſuſpected, and may force him into another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, I cannot help believing that the King will not to a tittle let her feel the aſſurance and benefit of his Promiſes.</p>
            <p>But next, <hi>we have his Age for our Security,</hi> which is the ſecond Proof, of the ſecond Reaſon, why the Papiſts ſhould look no farther then a <hi>Toleration.</hi> This is the want of time I mention'd. They have but <hi>one Life in the Leaſe,</hi> and 'tis out of their power to renew; and this Life has liv'd faſt too, and is got within ſeven of threeſcore; A greater Age then moſt of his Anceſtors ever attain'd. <hi>Well, but he has an Army and many Officers of his own Religion.</hi> And if it be ſo, what can it do? It may ſuppreſs an Inſurrection, but upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps we fooliſhly fear, they were hardly a Breakfaſt to the Quarters they live in. For if they were together, all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines or remote parts of the Nation would Riſe like Graſs upon them, and if diſperſed, to be ſure they have not ſtrength for ſuch an Attempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if they are not ſufficient, there is a Potent Prince not far off can help the Deſign, who is not angry with Proteſtancy at home only.</hi> Suppoſe this, is there not as Potent <hi>Naval</hi> Powers to aſſiſt the Conſtitution of the Kingdom from ſuch Invaſions? yes, and Land ones too. And as the Proteſtant Governments have more Ships then the other, ſo an equal Land Force, when by ſuch attempts to make Popery univerſal, they are awaken'd to the uſe of them: But certainly we muſt be very ſilly to think the King ſhould ſuffer ſo great a ſhake to his own Intereſt as admitting an Army of Forraigners to enter his Kingdom on any pretence, muſt neceſſarily occaſion. Theſe <hi>Bull-Beggers,</hi> and <hi>Raw-Heads</hi> and <hi>Bloody-Bones,</hi> are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of ſome, and Weakneſs of others. But time, that Informs
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54106:28"/>
Children, will tell the World the meaning of the Fright.</p>
            <p>The third Proof of my ſecond Reaſon, is <hi>the Inteſtine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion among themſelves.</hi> That Diviſion, weakens a great Body, and renders a ſmall one harmleſs, all will agree. Now that there is ſuch a thing as Diviſion among them is town talk The <hi>Seculars</hi> &amp; <hi>Regulars</hi> have ever been two Intereſts all the Roman Church over, and they are not only ſo here, but the <hi>Regulars</hi> differ among themſelves. There is not a Coffee-Houſe in Town that does not freely tell us that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictines</hi> are at variance, that Count <hi>Da Da</hi> the Popes Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio and Biſhop <hi>Lyborn</hi> Diſſent mightily from the Politicks of the firſt; Nay t'other Day the Story was that they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd Entirely over them. The Lords and Gentlemen of her Communion have as warmly conteſted about the lengths they ought to go, <hi>Moderation</hi> ſeems to be the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Together they are <hi>little,</hi> and can do little; and divided, they are Contemptible inſtead of Terrible.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ought to be diſcreet, and think of nothing further then the entreated general Eaſe, becauſe it would be an extream that muſt beget another in the ſucceeding Raign. For as I can never think her ſo weak as well as baſe, that after all her Arguments for the <hi>Jus divinum</hi> of Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe ſhould, in the Face of the World, attempt to violate it in the wrong of One of another Perſwaſion, (for that were an eternal loſs of her with Mankind) So if ſhe does not, and yet is Extravagant, ſhe only riſes higher to fall lower then all others in another Raign. This were provoking their own Ruin. And to ſay true, either way would, as the ſecond Letter has it, diſcredit her for ever and make true Prophets of thoſe they had taken ſuch pains to prove falſe Witneſſes. And ſuppoſing her to reckon upon the juſt Succeſſion, nothing can recommend her, or continue her happineſs in a Raign of another Judgment, but this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54106:29"/>
equally maintained, that other Perſwaſions, more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, for that reaſon as well as for their own ſakes, are obliged to inſure her. Here the Foundation is broad and ſtrong, and what is built upon it, has the looks of long Life. The Indenture will at leaſt be, <hi>quint-pertite,</hi> and Parties are not ſo mortal as Men. And as this joyns, ſo it preſerves Intereſt intire, which amounts to a <hi>Religious Amity</hi> and a <hi>Civil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> at the worſt.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, I adviſe the Members of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion</hi> in this Kingdom, to be moderate, 'tis their Duty and it belongs to all Men to ſee it and feel it from them, and it behoves them mightily they would; for the firſt part of this Diſcourſe belongs to their <hi>Hopes,</hi> as well as to the Church of <hi>Englands Fears,</hi> viz. the <hi>Duty and Spirit of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> Next, let them do <hi>good Offices</hi> between the King and his excellent Children, for as that will be well taken by ſo affectionate a Father, ſo it gives the lie to their Enemies Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, and recommends them to the Grace and Favour of the Succeſſors. And having ſaid this, I have ſaid all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them in particular. There is left only my Addreſs to the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> and a general Concluſion to finiſh this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Your Caſe that are called <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> differs mightily from that of the <hi>Church of England and Rome.</hi> For the firſt have the <hi>Laws</hi> for her, the laſt the <hi>Prince.</hi> Thoſe Laws are <hi>againſt</hi> you, and ſhe is not willing they ſhould be Repeal'd: The Prince offers to be kind to you if you pleaſe; Your Intereſt, in this Conjuncture, is the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> I think none ought to be made, that it is the <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> deſired, becauſe you have much more need of it, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Laws nor Prince of your ſide, nor a Succeſſor of any of your Perſwaſions. The Fears of Popery I know reach you; but it is to be remembered alſo, that if the Laws are not Repeal'd,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54106:29"/>
there wants no new ones to Deſtroy you, of the Papiſts ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; ſo that every fear you are taught to have of their Repeal, is againſt your ſelves. Suppoſe your Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons well grounded, you can but be Deſtroy'd; Which is moſt comfortable for you to ſuffer by Law or without it? The Church of <hi>England, by her Penal Laws, and the Doctrine of Headſhip,</hi> has Armed that Religion (as it falls out) to Deſtroy you. Nay, has made it a Duty in the King to do it, from which (ſays ſhe) nothing but an Act of Parliament can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him, &amp; that ſhe is not willing to allow. And is it not as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that you ſhould ſeek their Repeal, that if you ſuffer from the Papiſts, It may be without human Law, as well as againſt Chriſts Law, as for the Church of <hi>England</hi> to keep them in force, becauſe if ſhe ſuffers, it ſhall be againſt the Laws made to uphold her? For not repealing them, brings you an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table miſchief, and her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at moſt, but an uncertain ſafety; tho 'tis certain, ſhe at the ſame time will Sacrifice you to it. And yet if I were in her caſe, it would pleaſe me better to remove Laws that might reproach me, and ſtop my Mouth when turn'd againſt me, and be content, that if I Suffer for my Religion, it is againſt the Law of <hi>God, Chriſtianity</hi> and the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of the old and true Civil Government of my Country, before ſuch Laws helpt to ſpoil it. In ſhort, you muſt either <hi>go to Church,</hi> or <hi>Meet,</hi> or <hi>let fall your Worſhipping of God</hi> in the way you believe. If the firſt, you are <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> and give away the Cauſe, and reproach your dead Brethrens Sincerity, and gratifie the old accuſation of <hi>Schiſm, Ambition, &amp;c.</hi> and finally looſe the Hope and Reward of all your Sufferings. If the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> that you <hi>Meet againſt Law,</hi> you run into the Mouth of the Government, whoſe Teeth are to meet in you and Deſtroy you, <hi>as by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,.</hi> If the laſt, you deny your Faith, over-throw your own Arguments, fall away from the Apoſtolical Doctrine of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54106:30"/>
aſſembling together, and ſo muſt fall into the Hands of God, and under the troubles of your own Conſciences and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his Spirit, of which 'tis ſaid, <hi>who can bear them.</hi> So that nothing is plainer then that <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> are not oblig'd to govern themſelves after <hi>ſuch Church of England Meaſures,</hi> ſuppoſing her Fears and Jealouſies better Bottom'd then they are: For they are neither in this Kings time in the ſame Condition, with her if the Penal Laws remain in force, nor like to be ſo, if ſhe can help it, in the next Raign, if they are not Repeal'd in this; ſo that they are to be certainly Perſecuted now, in hopes of an uncertain Liberty then. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain both whether it will be in her Power, and whether ſhe will do it if it be. The <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> are two things, <hi>Affliction</hi> promiſes what <hi>Proſperity</hi> rarely performs. Of this the Promiſes made to induce the late Kings Reſtoration, and the cancelling of the former Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and what followed upon both are a plain proof. And tho the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter Parliament</hi> enclin'd to it; no body ſo much oppos'd it as the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the moſt Zealous Sons of that Church: And if they could or would not then ſee it to be reaſonable, I can't ſee why one ſhould truſt to People ſo ſelfiſh and ſhort ſighted. But if ſhe will ſtoop to all thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Intereſts that are Proteſtant, it muſt either be by a <hi>comprehenſion,</hi> and then ſhe muſt part with her <hi>Biſhops,</hi> her <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> her <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and this it ſelf is but <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>; (and ſhe muſt go lower yet, if ſhe will comprehend the reſt) or, if not, ſhe muſt Perſecute or give this <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> at laſt; which, that ſhe will ever yeild to uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd, and at a time too, when there is none to do it, while ſhe refuſes it under her preſent preſſing Circumſtances, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fefs I cannot apprehend. But there is yet one Argument that can never fail to oblige your compliance with the General Eaſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; <hi>viz. That the Penal Laws are againſt our great Law
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54106:30"/>
of Property, and ſo void in themſelves.</hi> This has been the Language of every <hi>Apology,</hi> and that which, to ſay true, is not to be anſwer'd: How then can you decline to help their Repeal, that in <hi>Conſcience, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> you think void in their own Nature?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is nothing that can put you in a Condition to help your ſelves or the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> but that which ſhe weakly thinks the way to hurt you both, <hi>viz. The Repeal of the Penal Laws.</hi> For as you are, you are <hi>tyed</hi> Hand and Foot, you are not your own men, you can neither ſerve her nor your ſelves, you are faſt in the Stocks of her Laws, and the courſe ſhe would have you take, is to turn <hi>Martyrs</hi> under them to ſuppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t them. If you like the <hi>Bargain</hi> you are the beſt natur'd People in the World, and ſomething more. And ſince Begging is in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, I ſhould deſire no other <hi>Boon</hi>; for upon ſo plain a loſs of your Wits, your Eſtates will of courſe fall a ſtray to the Government, ſo that without the help of a Penal Law, you make an admirable Prize.</p>
            <p>I have no mind to end ſo pleaſantly with you. I have a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and Chriſtian regard to you and yours. <hi>Be not Couzn'd, nor Captious, at this Juncture.</hi> I know ſome of you are told, if you loſe this Liberty, <hi>you Introduce Idolatry,</hi> and for Conſcience ſake you cannot do it. But that's a pure miſtake, and improv'd, I fear, by thoſe that know it is ſo, which makes it the worſe; for it is not Introducing Idolatry (taking for granted that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is ſo) but ſaving the People from being Deſtroy'd that profeſs that Religion. If <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had taken this courſe with the World, they muſt have <hi>Killed</hi> them inſtead of <hi>Converting</hi> them. 'Tis your miſtake to think the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> rigorous Conſtitution is adequate to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; by no means: That one Conceit of <hi>Judaiſing Chriſtianity</hi> in our Politicks, has fill'd the World with Miſery,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54106:31"/>
of which this poor Kingdom has had its ſhare. <hi>Idolators</hi> are to be <hi>Enlighten'd</hi> and <hi>Perſwaded,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and not <hi>knock on the Head,</hi> which mends no body. And to ſay a Chriſtian Magiſtrate is to do that, that a Chriſtian can't do, is ridiculous; unleſs like the <hi>Biſhop of Munſter,</hi> who goes like a Biſhop one part of the Day, and a Souldier the other, he is to be <hi>a Chriſtian in the Morning and a Magiſtrate in the Afternoon.</hi> Beſides, 'tis one thing to enact a Religion National, and compel Obedience to it (which would make this Caſe abominable indeed) and another thing to take off unchriſtian Penalties for the ſake of ſuch miſtakes, ſince that is to give them Power to hurt others, and this only to ſave you from being hurt for meer Religion.</p>
            <p>To conclude my Addreſs to you, of all People, it would look the moſt diſingenious in you, and give you an Aire, the leaſt Senſible, Charitable and Chriſtian not to endeavour ſuch an Eaſe that have ſo much wanted it, and ſo often and ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſſed it, even to Clamour. But that you ſhould do it for their Sakes who have uſed you ſo, and that the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Cruelty, <hi>the Penal Laws,</hi> ſhould from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Grievance become a Darling to any among you, will be ſuch a Reproach to your Underſtandings and Conſciences, that no Time or Argument can wipe off, and which I beſeech God and You to prevent.</p>

            <head>The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>I Shall conclude with one Argument, that equally concerns you all, and that is this; you claim the Caracter of <hi>Engliſh Men.</hi> Now to be an <hi>Engliſh Man,</hi> in the ſence of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to be a <hi>Freeman,</hi> whether <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Commoner,</hi> to hold

            </p>
            <p>This regard muſt at no time be neglected, or violated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any one Intereſt; for the moment we concede to ſuch a Breach upon our General Liberty, be it from an averſion we carry to the Principles of thoſe we expoſe, or ſome little ſiniſter and temporary Benefit of our own, we Sacrifice our ſelves in the prejudices we draw upon others, or ſuffer them to fall under; for our Intereſt in this reſpect is common. If then as <hi>Engliſh men,</hi> we are as mutually intereſted in the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable conſervation of each others Civil Rights, as men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd in the ſame Veſſel are to ſave the Ship they are in for their own ſakes, we ought to Watch, Serve and Secure the Intereſt of one another, becauſe it is our own to do ſo; and not by any means endure that to be done to pleaſe ſome nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row regard of any one Party, <hi>which may be drawn in Example at ſome other turn of Power to our own utter Ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had this Honeſt, Juſt, Wiſe and Engliſh Conſideration prevailed with our Anceſtors of all Opinions from the days of <hi>Richard the ſecond,</hi> there had been leſs <hi>Blood, Impriſonment, Plunder, Beggery</hi> for the Government of this Kingdom to anſwer for. Shall I ſpeak within our own knowledge, and that without Offence, there has been Ruin'd, ſince the late Kings Reſtoration, above <hi>Fifteen Thouſand Families,</hi> and more then <hi>Five Thouſand Perſons</hi> Dead under Bonds for matters of <hi>meer Conſcience</hi> to God: But who hath laid it to Heart? It is high time now we ſhould, eſpecially when our King, with ſo much Grace and Goodneſs leads us the way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54106:32"/>I beſeech you all, if you have any Reverence towards God, any Value for the Excellent Conſtitution of this Kingdom, any Tenderneſs for your Poſterity, any Love for your Selves, you would embrace this happy Conjuncture, and perſue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Expedient; That ſince we cannot agree to meet in one Profeſſion of Religion, we may entirely do it in this common civil Intereſt where we are all equally engaged; and therefore we ought for our own ſakes to ſeek one an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>cy</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi> Man, <hi>Free-will</hi> in the Arminian, <hi>Predeſtination</hi> in the Presbyterian, <hi>Perticular Churches</hi> in the Independant, <hi>Dipping of adult People</hi> in the Anabaptiſt, nor <hi>not-ſwearing</hi> in the Quaker, ought to be made a <hi>Teſt</hi> of, to deprive him of the comforts of his Life, or render him incapable of the ſervice of his Country, to which by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Obligation he is indebted, and from which, no Opinion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54106:32"/>
can diſcharge him, and for that Reaſon, much leſs ſhould any other Party think it fit, or in their power to exclude him.</p>
            <p>And indeed it were ridiculous to talk of giving Liberty of Conſcience (which yet few have now the fore-head to oppoſe) and at the ſame time imagine thoſe <hi>Teſts</hi> that do exclude men that Service and Reward, ought to be continued: For though it does not immediately concern me, being neither <hi>Officer</hi> nor <hi>Papiſt,</hi> yet the Conſequence is general, and every party, even the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will find her ſelf concern'd upon reflection; For ſhe cannot aſſure her ſelf it may not come to be her turn.</p>
            <p>But, Is it not an odd thing, that by leaving them on foot, every Body ſhall have Liberty of Conſcience <hi>but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>? for while a man is out of Office, he is <hi>Teſt</hi>-free, but the hour he is choſen to any ſtation, be it in the <hi>Legiſlation</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtration,</hi> he muſt <hi>wiredraw</hi> his Conſcience to hold it, or be excluded with the Brand of Diſſent: And can this be equal or wiſe? Is this the way to employ men for the good of the Publick, where <hi>Opinion prevails above vertue,</hi> and <hi>Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſubmitted to the humour of a Party</hi>; ſurely none can think this a <hi>Cure</hi> for Diviſion, or that Animoſities are like to be prevented by the only ways in the World that beget and heighten them. Nor is it poſſible that the eaſe that ſhould be granted can continue long when the <hi>Party</hi> in whoſe ſavour they are not repeal'd, may thereby be enabled to turn the point of the ſword again upon Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>I know <hi>Holland</hi> is given in Objection to this extent of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where only <hi>one Perſwaſion has the Government,</hi> tho the reſt their Liberty: But they don't conſider, firſt, <hi>how much more</hi> Holland <hi>is under the power of Neceſſity then we are.</hi> Next, <hi>That our Conſtitutions differ greatly.</hi> For the firſt, 'tis plain, in the little compaſs they live in; the uncertainty and precariouſneſs of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54106:33"/>
the means of their ſubſiſtance: That as they are in more danger of Drowning, ſo neerer ruin by any Commotion in the State, then other Countries are. <hi>Trading</hi> is their Support, <hi>This,</hi> keeps them buſy, <hi>That,</hi> makes them Rich; and <hi>Wealth,</hi> naturally gives them <hi>caution</hi> of the diſorders that may ſpoil them of it. This makes the governing Party wary how they uſe their power, and the other Intereſts tender how they reſiſt it; for upon it, they have reaſon to fear a publick Deſolation; ſince <hi>Holland</hi> has not a natural and Domeſtick <hi>Fund</hi> to rely upon, or return to from ſuch national Diſorders.</p>
            <p>The next Conſideration is as clear and cogent; our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions differ mightily:</hi> For though they have the Name of a <hi>Republick,</hi> yet in their choice, in order to the Legiſlature they are much leſs free then we are: And ſince the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders</hi> of all Parties in <hi>England</hi> may Elect, which in <hi>Holland</hi> they can no more do then they can be choſen, there is good reaſon why all may be elected to ſerve their King &amp; Country here, that in <hi>Holland</hi> cannot be choſen or ſerve. And if our Power to chuſe be larger then theirs in <hi>Holland,</hi> we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly then a freer People, and ſo ought not to be confin'd, as they are about what Perſon it is that muſt be choſen: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it bears no proportion, and therefore the Inſtance and Objection are improper to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But it is ſaid by ſome, <hi>That there cannot be two predominant Religions, and if the</hi> Church of England <hi>be not that,</hi> Popery <hi>by the Kings Favour is like to be ſo.</hi> It is certain that <hi>two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Religions,</hi> would be two Uppermoſts at once, which is nonſence every where: But as I cannot ſee what need there is for the Church of <hi>England</hi> to loſe her Churhces or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, ſo while ſhe has them, Believe me, ſhe is <hi>Predominant</hi> in the thing of the World that lies neareſt her Guides. But if I were to ſpeak my inclination, I cannot apprehend the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any <hi>Predominant</hi> Religion, underſtanding the word
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54106:33"/>
with <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in the tale of it: The Miſchief of it, in a Country of ſo many powerful Intereſts as this, I can eaſily underſtand, having had the opertunity of ſeeing and feeling it too: And becauſe nothing can keep up the Ball of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance like ſuch a <hi>Predominant</hi> Religion, and that <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> are the means of the Domination, I, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, think them fit to be Repeal'd, and let Engliſh Mankind ſay <hi>AMEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not love Quibling, but 'tis true, to a Lamentation, that there is little of the <hi>power of Religion</hi> ſeen where there is ſuch a predominant one, unleſs among thoſe it Domineers over.</p>
            <p>I conclude, they that are ſo <hi>Predominant,</hi> and they that ſeek to be ſo (be they who they will) move by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Principle, and however differing their Pretentions and Ends may be, the odds are very little to me, by which it is I muſt certainly be Oppreſt.</p>
            <p>Dare we then <hi>do</hi> (for once) <hi>as we would be done by,</hi> and ſhow the World, we are not Religious <hi>without Juſtice,</hi> nor Chriſtians <hi>without Charity:</hi> That <hi>Falſe ſelf</hi> ſhall not govern us againſt <hi>True ſelf</hi>; nor <hi>oppertunity</hi> make us Thieves, to our Neighbours for Gods ſake? the end of <hi>Teſting</hi> and <hi>Perſecuting</hi> under every Revolution of Government. If this we can find in our Hearts to do, and yet as Men, and as Chriſtians, as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Men, we do but do our Duty, let the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and <hi>Teſts</hi> be Repeal'd; and in order to it, <hi>Let us now take thoſe meaſures of men and things,</hi> that may give our Wiſhes and Endeavours the beſt ſucceſs for the publick good, that our <hi>Poſterity</hi> may have more reaſon to bleſs our Memories for their <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> then for their <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Inheritance.</hi>
