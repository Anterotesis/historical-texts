            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This ones conceyued by fayth in Abell and
Enos / at the preachynges of Adam &amp; Seth
for the first age / prouoked the one to offre vp
sacrifice vnto hi / &amp; the other to call vpon his
most gloryouse name. In this godlye offyce
was Noe founde ryghtouse / Abraham sayth
full / Moses myghtye / Dauid holye / Helias
feruent / and manye other more in their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
zelouse for all the other ages. Farre to
longe were yt and tedyouse vnto the readers
to recyte the examples of all the fathers in
that behalfe. Iesus Christ the onlye fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of all ryghtousnesse / in all his sore trauay

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye
father / and taught the same lesson aboue
all other to be obserued of his. In the many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
temptacions of sathan in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
he pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlye answered to that was sug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gested / 
but the presumed dishonour of God
in no case coulde he suffre. The holye Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and manye other Godlye mynysters / 
haue euermore daungered their syues in the
lust quarell of the same. If we than wetyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

all these godlye exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples reiected / we
myght thereby rather apere his enemyes / 
<pb facs="tcp:734:2"/>
than seruauntes / his haters than louers.
This consyderacion first moued my mynde / 
after that I had seane a thre years ago / an
abhomynable Iest made vndre the tyttle of
a Genealogye of heresye / &amp; by two diuerse

Godlye menne which are oblocuted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
In this will no man that is godlye be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended / 
but thynke that I haue herin done
my bounde dewtye. Though the compylet
therof by the mercyfull Goodnesse of God
be conuerted to repentaunce (as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyblye

his blasphemouse doctryne amonge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

people in a wonderfull nombre of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyes.
I thought yt therfore mete / not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

of those wycked blasphemyes to
suffre them passe at large. yet I instauntlye

I not haue them to space / so longe as he

Philip Melanchton is here brought in for

But what is it (I praye you) that Lambert
ded denye? That Christ was his Lorde. No

In this fayth perseuered he vnto his latter

God. yet sought your generacion by most
turkyshe tyrannye to compell him to remoue
his fote from that rocke. But mercyfull was
that lorde vnto him. In the myddes of the

hence with the clere victorye ouer you. Non
of the Popes sworne subiectes dyed he / but
the verye true seruaunt of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>2 His denyall was in dede that Christ
shuld be contayned in the bankett of youre

More profyght is it to be chastened of a wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

Pantolabus seketh here. A benefyce of my

him agayne to scole to declyne this pronow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

Diuinare is sumtyme to gesse at a venture /

that he shulde be good lorde vnto him in an

myght be preferred for this his good zele / 
but also his good diuynite is putt in here
with him. The nature of this dowtye diuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
is to stande moche in the declynynge of

it is taken vp for hygh diuynite in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storye

sacrament. Lyke is it to be no small matter
for menne to be burned for / are they haue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

or argumentes. Necessarye is it to declyne a
pronowne wele / for him that will knowe the

forsoth here is godlye Christen lernynge

               <p>3 Sumwhat must these braggynge hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites

the declynynge of hoc maketh nothynge

therof. That is yet all togither to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe.
I put Wynchestre and Pantolabus

His eye syght therfor serued him not so
wele vpon this syde as vpon that syde. The
Popes enemies are the onlye heretiques in

of Christ and his kynge. Be that farre from

Garade a bachelar of diuinite and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son

For yf he were / he wolde nor regestre him

Garade &amp; Barnes both be now of that bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhede
which God the father hath allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

lyke to be so. For that heretage in Christ is

the Antichrist of Rome by a newe obedience

This is the conclusion he seketh.</p>
               <p>3 Fayne wolde Pantolabus haue them

that he might lyue lyke a gentylman
and haue his dishes the fatter / and his pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se

to haue the people on both sydes of the way

the lambes folowe the wolfe / which is a cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ell

good lorde of Wynchestre / his good lorde of
London. His good lordes of lyncolne / yorke

This hath he borowed of the. xii. Chapter

Poete of the Popes pultrye / thus to

For all that they do in their churche as

to bestowe vpon his kynge but a prayer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

For moche better yt is to be vnprayed

Though Hierusalem were holye and

ponnyshed for sufferinge blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers /

                  </gap>ust tyttle
to be called owr ladye. No true fygure is she
to Marye the mother of Christ. For neuer
was she so farre from the ryght faythe / that
she sorowed so largelye for that thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge which
was vnto vs all most necessarye. I knowe
she neuer wept so vndyscretely for the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
of Christ / which was owr vniuersall hel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the / 
but most hyghly reioysed therin. If she
euer mourned / it was for the synnes of the
people / and for that she sawe his veryte con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pned
of the cruell clergye / as it is yet styll.
They therfor which worshyp that sorowfull
pyte of Marye / do honour that infydelyte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
she neuer had / and make them therof an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll.
Thus is the sygne that Iohan Redma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
dwelleth vndre / an exercrable Idoll / and
he for so magnifyenge her with that tyttle / 
a verye Idoll worshypper. The lesse marue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le
is it / that soche fylthye frutes cometh out
of his howse. Here is he not ashamed open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to confesse / that he hath sett his handes
to most wycked Papystrye / and vnto an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
of peruerted Scripturs / to the great dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
both of God and of his kynge. Adioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ninge

               <p>4 Now foloweth Robert wyer / &amp; he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unteth

he hath promoted forewarde these Popyshe
Poesyes and Scripturs abhominablye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.
Wherin he hath done all that hath
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:734:94"/>
lyen in him / to assure the ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges faythfull sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iectes

What shall we than recken it / whan that
fylthynesse is ministred of them / which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth
their sowles to eternall deathe. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is the vnsacyable thirst of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are
couetouse / that they care not what mysche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes
they do to get money. If the deuyll had
geuen them a matter ageynst Christ / as his
sworne Chaplayne hath done here ageynst
his true seruauntes / and haue monyed them
wele / they wolde surely haue done by that / 
lyke as they haue done by this. And the
daye wyll ones come that they shall fynde it
all one. The kynges priuylege. Ad imprime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

anye chaunce for it at the latter daye (whom

               <p>¶Expreslye is it here to be seane (dere

of Antichrist. I perseyue by him and soche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

strengthe in his loynes / to sende forth soche
sturdye babes. Not longe afore that they
hydde their heades / and durst not be seane
abrode. But tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ded they on their mothers
shamelesse face / and were ageyne as brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge
as in their Popes tyme. Small harme
is it to them that the Beastes head was wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded / 
it is so wele and workemanlye heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
