            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOST MIGHTIE and most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, most feared, and best beloued Princes, they are at the bottome of a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse miserie, whome both a condemned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state maketh common obiects of abuse, and an vnpittied oppression barreth from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering their griefes to those, that onelie are able to afford them remedy. Euery one trampleth vpon theyr ruine, whom a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces disgrace hath once ouerthrowne. Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne fauours being the best foundations of Subiects fortunes, and theyr dislikes the steepest downe-falles to all vnhappinesse. Yet a Prince supplying the roome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the person of Almightie GOD, should be so indifferent an arbitrator in all causes, that neyther any greatnesse should
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19552:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beare downe Iustice, nor any meanes be excluded from mercie; and therefore an humble confidence in your Maiestes good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, (perfect in all Princely duties, &amp; the only shot anker of our iust hopes) induced vs to lay open our manifold extremities, which heretofore (as it seemeth) hath bin scarcelie heard, lesse beleeued, and nothing regarded. And though our condition be so desolate, that wee can neyther be freed from outward miserie, but by becomming inwardly more miserable, nor complaine of our troubles, but our very complaints are punished: yet an infamed life, being to free mindes more irkesome then an innocent death, we had rather put our vttermost ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to your highnes clemencie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seeme with our silence to giue credit to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques: to which if wee doe not, it may be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined we cannot answere.</p>
            <p>There hath beene of late published to our vndeserued reproch, so straunge a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that it hath made your most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Subiects doubtfull vvhat to beleeue: sith they see so apparent and vncurable truthes, countenanced with so Reuerende authoritie, &amp; warranted with the most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred sight of theyr most honored Queene:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19552:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the due respect that euery one carrieth to your gratious person, acquiteth you in their knowledge, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any meaning to haue false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood masked vnder the veile of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie: yet when they see your Soueraigne stile so abased, to the authorizing of ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Magistrates of the vvhole realme, most generally sooth thinges so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly disproued by common scence, and contrarie to their own, and all mens know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it cannot be but a torment to theyr Christian mindes: yea, and it must make them of force iustlie to scorne that anie Subiect should dare in so high a degree, to blemmish both his Princes, and her officers credits, as to draw them to auerre his plaine and inexcusable lesings: for what can they thinke, but this to be either a racking of publike authoritie to priuate pusposes, who being yet ripe to reueale their owne dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous grounds, are forced to borrow these deluding shadowes, or an open condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Maiesties actions, as though they bare themselues vppon so vniust and lawles motiues as could not able them for righteous, but by begging releefe of these counterfet illusions.</p>
            <p>Wee verily presume that none of your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19552:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Maiesties Honorable Councell, would ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew so little accquaintance with the Princes stile, as to deliuer in your name a discourse so full farced with contumelious tearmes, as better suted a declamorous tongue, then your highnes penne, or be so lightly affected to the regard of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as to defile it with the touch of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false assertions: yet all men iustly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile that any Inditor durst aduenture to disgorge their priuate ill will, rather then to obserue decencie in so publike a thing: yea they lament their own case, when these abuses make vncertaine what to credit in serious points, importing their Countrie, &amp; their owne safeties, when they see in this (which seemeth to be but a Prologue to future Tragedies) the strongest foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to humane beleefe, applyed in all mens mindes to support meere improbabilites. And though the iniurie offered to your Maiestie, and meerely concerning your Realme, might in equitie challenge al mens pennes to warne you of so perilous courses: yet sith Priestes and Catholikes, are the markes chieflie shot at, wee aske humblie leaue of your Maiestie and Councell, to shew how chollericke the humor was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19552:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs, that cared not though the arrow hit your Highnes Honour in the way, so the head therof might enter into our harts. It is an easie thing to be a true Prophet, in foreseeing how this necessarie clearing will be aggrauated to your Maiestie with hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous words, sith those that would dislodge vs out of all good opinions, will doubtlesse endeuour to fulfil any such Prophecie: but now we humble our Petitions to your care of innocencie, that it may arme your eares against such partiall appeachers, and incline you to measure your censure with equitie.</p>
            <p>To make therefore our entrie vvith the vnfauorable tearmes, wherein we are often and generally called vnnaturall Subiectes, wee desire to haue it decided by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties owne arbitrement, whether we haue iustly deserued to weare so base a liuerie: if wee liue at home as Catholikes professing our name, and refusing to professe a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Religion, we can neyther keepe our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Innes of Court, but wee are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for Recusancie, impouerished, troubled, &amp; defamed. And yet if we leaue all and seeke free vse of our conscience, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Realme taking such helpes as the Charity of other countries affordeth vs, we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19552:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are strait rekoned for vnnaturall Subiects.</p>
            <p>It is rather an vnnaturall thing to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the author of nature for any creature, in forsaking the faith by which wee hope only to be saued, and yet we must doe this to the wilfull murdering of our soules: or if we refuse it, be we at home or abroad, by these hard censures we are proclaimed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural. All bonds both of nature &amp; grace inuite vs to loue God, and our Countrie more then our liues, and our neighbours as our selues: which if we obserue in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree, we hope what other title soeuer we deserue, we shall at the least be deemed not to swarue from the rules of Natiue curtesie: we are in so mightie &amp; warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofes assured by all Antiquitie, that our Catholike Faith is the onely truth, (to which all that haue bin, or shall be saued, must owe their fidelitie) that we thinke it a worthy purchase, for the perseuerance in the same to forfet our best fortunes, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our liues to the great cruelties, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reuolting from it, to enter league with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, &amp; to make our soules the price of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal paine, if the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we esteeme it at a higher rate then our liues, beleeuing that out of it, neyther God can be truelie serued, nor any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19552:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
soule saued: so if wee seeke with our dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest perrills to plant it in our Realme, and to winne soules from misbeleefe vnto it, we thinke that we owe a most sincere, and naturall loue to our Countrie: for euen by Christs owne testimonie, no mans Charitie reacheth to any higher point, then to yeeld his life for the benefit of his friend. And if others that so deepely touch vs for vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral creatures, would with as much diligence haue searched out the truth by an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent triall, betweene the learned on both sides, as they haue with violence martyred, and oppressed vs, they vvould happilie thinke themselues more vnnaturall, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing misledde infinite soules into endlesse perdition, then vs that with the sweat of our dearest blood, seeke to gleane a few scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered eares, the sillie reliques of their infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate haruest. And if our due care of our Countrie be such, that to reare the least fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len soule amongst your Maiesties Subiects from a fatall lapse, we are contented to pay our liues for the ransome, how much better should wee thinke them bestowed, if so high a penny-worth as your GRACIOVS SELFE, or the whole Realme might be the gaynes of our dearest purchase.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19552:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>But though they that hunt this fault in vs, might best be their owne pray (faith being the strongest of true and naturall fidelitie: yet must we be accounted vnnaturall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ballanced in their affections, that draw all causes of compassion to motiues of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and make theyr condemning reports, the contraries of our dutiful meanings with the like spirit, still breathing more ill will, then truth: He tearmeth the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Lord Cardinall Archbishop <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and Father <hi>Parsons</hi> (both learned &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent men) two seditious heads, looking happily through such eyes, as iudge all men by theyr owne colours, &amp; what cause haue they giuen to this slaunderer, vnlesse it be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted sedition to gather the ruins of Gods afflicted Church, and to haue prouided Sanctuaries, for persecuted &amp; succourlesse soules: which forced at home, either to liue with a goared conscience, or to lie open to continuall vexations, rather choose to leaue theyr countrie then their Catholike Religion. It was no sedition for many in Queene Maries time, to be harboured in Geneua, maintained the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by those that now enuie against vs. It is no sedition to admit such multitudes of straungers, as for theyr
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19552:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
faith swarme into England, out of all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. It is thought Charity to aid the Stats of Flaunders in the behalfe of Religion. It is extolled in your Maiestie as an Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fauour to protect the Portingall, and S. <hi>Horatio Palanisine</hi>: but if wee (whose case at home) in respect of our faith is more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then any Protestantes in any other Countries, haue chosen two venerable men to procure vs some refuge, from our dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall scourges, where wee may follow our studies, and exercise Pietie, strait your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie (though induced to practise the same curtesie to others) is informed against them as seditious heades. So true it is, the same thing is not it selfe in diuers persons, &amp; yet as God almightie and the world is our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nothing in those Seminaries, is either intended, or practised, but the releefe and good education of such forsaken men, as from the storme of our English shoare, flie thether for a calme roade, that perfited in the course of learning &amp; vertue, they may returne to offer theyr blood for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie of soules: As for the basenes of theyr birthes, which among other like pointes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is interlaced vvith as impertinent, as scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a parenthesis, as a fitter noate for the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19552:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
penners, than for your maiesties obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>I meane not to dwel long vpon it, for the thing neither importeth any offence to God, not crime against your Maiesty, nor greatly abaseth them, whom excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the onely true measure of worthinesse hath ennobled. Yet this without disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any may truely be auoided, that the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> grace, is of as good &amp; ancient a house, &amp; euery way as worshipfully allied as some of the highest Counselours were in their meaner fortunes, till your Maiesties fauors, and their rare abilities, made them steppes to clime into their present honours. And whether he might of likelihood haue carried as high a sail if the time had equally secunded him with fauorable gales, I leaue to their iudgementes who are priuy to his present estate, greater than England can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to any cleargy man.

as this inditor would perswade your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, though some of the simple sort of our English souldiers, in the Gallies, vpon error and ignorance, muttered some such spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches amongst them selues. As for other Priestes how many of them are Knights &amp; Esquires sonnes, as otherwise both to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull and noble houses alleyed, &amp; heires to faire reuenewes, let their owne friendes and Parents dispersed through the whole Realme beare witnesse. This onely vvee may say in answere of our obiected base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that in the small number of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Priestes of our Nation, (vvhich reacheth not to the tenth of the Protestant Ministrie) there are very neare as many, yea happily more Gentlemen, then in all the other Cleargie of the whole Realme.</p>
            <p>Now whereas we are most vncourteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie called a multitude of disolute young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, wee desire no other euidence to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue this accusation, then an indifferent censure: For first before our departure out of the Realme, we must resolue to abandon our Countrie friendes, and all such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as naturally all men seeke and finde in theyr natiue Countrie. Wee must relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish all possibilities of fauour, riches, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19552:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
credit. We must limite our mindes to the restrained and seuere course of the SOCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY OF IESVS, or the Seminaries, where the place is in exile, the rules strickt, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement austere, our willes broken, the least fault chastised, &amp; a most absolute ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue exacted. And who can imagine those to be so desolute humors, who this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to abridge themselues of all actions, of disolutenes, and to imprison their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within the presinct of a reguler and straight order, and lest happily it may be imagined that wee say more then in proofe we finde, it is knowne to thousandes, and daylie seene, and witnessed by trauellers, that we are there tide to so prezise tearmes in diet, apparell, exercise, &amp; all other things, that wee are much more shortned of our scope, then in any Colledge of our English Vniuersities. I omit the prayer, fasting, haire-cloth, and other chastisements of the body, vvhich being voluntary, yet vsuall; are to any if not more then partiall Iudges, inuincible groundes against this slaunder, of being dissolute: but let our intertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at our returne, be a finall ouerthrow of this false imposition: for who can thinke them dissolute, that being by the Lawes, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples

by commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experience taught, with what bloody conflictes they are heere to encounter, &amp; howe many feares, daingers, and agonies, both in life; and death, they vndoubtedly expect, (are notwithstanding contented) for reclaiming of soules vnto Gods folde, willing to yeelde their bodies to the hasard of al those miseries foreseene, and foreknowne, and aduisedly chosen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worldly contentments.</p>
            <p>But it may be that some, vnaquainted with our states, will measure our mindes, by our apparell, (beeing as we confesse) more agreeable oftentimes, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fashion, than to the graue attire that seemeth our calling, neither is our habit, or behauiour so ruffian-like, or disordered, (as this inditor, euer forgetting trueth, when he remembreth vs, would willingly haue it imagined) but in this we must yeeld our reason, (sith we cannot reforme the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience) till your Maiesty thinke it good to licence vs without daunger, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise our functions, much-more mighty is the saluation of our soules, than the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decency of our apparell, which though it be necessary in time and place, yet is it not so essentiall a point, as for the care
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19552:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thereof, to neglect the charge of Gods flocke, &amp; the safetie of our owne liues: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> vpon iust cause fained him mad, but his madnes was an effect of perfect wisedome, and reason the guide of his seeming follie. <hi>Iudith</hi> laying aside her hairecloth, and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes weed, disguised her selfe in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, as were fitter to allure laciuious eies, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beare witnes of her sober mind. And if God added grace &amp; beautie to her youthful dresses, to further her iust reuenge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her enimies, much more may we hope he will allow a lesse disguisage in vs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue the soules of our dearest friends. It is no sure argument of inward beautie, to be vaine in shew, seeing a modest and an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minde, may be shadowed vnder the glorious &amp; courtly robes of a vertuous <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> And if angels for the benefit of bodyes haue suted their shapes, to the requestes of their Ministers: now appearing like souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as to <hi>Iosua:</hi> now like trauailers, as to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi>: now like gratious youths, as to <hi>Lot</hi>: yea if Christ as the occasion required, seemed to the two Disciples a Pilgrime, &amp; to Saint <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> a Gardiner, why may not we for the winning of soules, (which as God is our witnes is the onely cause of our

comming) frame our behauiour and attyre, to the necessity of our daies, as we read the auncient bishops did, in the persecution of the <hi>Vandalls,</hi> this therfore ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be estemed a iust presumption of a dissolute minde in vs, whom not any will to such finenesse, but a desire of safety enforceth vs to weare the liueries of the time.</p>
            <p>Nowe whereas the heauy aduersaries of our good names, hath abused your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties eares with a truethlesse surmise, that we shoulde auoide the Realme for lacke of liuing, we humbly resigne his folly, to the correction of your Highnesse wisedome, for to whom can it seeme probable, that we flie for lacke of liuing, of whom many haue vowed all, willingly acepted a voluntary pouerty, leauing that we had, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope, or care of getting more, our wealth beeing nowe in well-doing, and our passions, our best possessions, is it like that for wante of liuing any woulde enter into a course, wherin without possibility of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment they were in apparant hazarde to loose their liues: are anie sledde for such pouerty, that at the least they coulde not haue liued in seruice, with more ease and lesse labour, than they tie themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

It pleaseth further this vnfriendly informer (who seemeth best pleased with displeasing vs) to deriue our departure from a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence guilty, of crimes committed, being stil himselfe in the likenesse of his speeches, as voide of veritie, as full of ill will: for if Priestes at theyr arraignement, be in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner charged with Originall sinne, many of them hauing bin scarcely borne, at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the North, which is alwaies a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place to declaime against them. If all the notorious faults, that may any way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Catholikes, are made ordinarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditements, to condemne those that neuer heard of them, till they come to the barre: how much would any fault of their own be obiected, yea and multiplied in the vrging, if any such could haue bin found: but yet none was euer touched for any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before his departure, as all testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies may depose, and the verie recordes te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie in our behalfe, and to preuent any inst groundes of this oblique, the superiours (not ignorant how many eyes are busied in watching for the least aduantage against vs) make diligent scrutenie, for the perfect notice of theyr vertue, whome they admit
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19552:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Priesthood, who being for the most part among many of theyr owne houses, or stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Vniuersities, could not cloake any great enormitie from notice: yea the very age of the greater part (they going e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer very young) is a warrant to quite them from any such offence, as should force them to flie their Countrie. And as for the rest, which are of riper yeares, they haue bin so notified for theyr morrall life, that they haue made common report theyr harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to take vp their due roomes, in euerie mans good opinion. In sume this being an approued accusation, deliuered by one that in the same discourse, hath empanalled an enquest of vntruths, to finde out him in this also guilty of falsehood, it needeth no other answere, but a wise censure of the Reader: But now most mercifull Princesse licence our too much wronged innocencie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the sharpest doubt of this vnkinde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, ioyned vvith those three odious tearmes of fugitiues, rebels, and traytours, &amp; dipped as deep in the bitternes of gaule, as hee would haue it enter into our dearest blood: And first wee craue most humblie but the right of Christians beleefe of our oath, which is the only Certificat to make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19552:12"/>
our thoughtes vndoubted; vppon hope whereof we oppose our guiltlesse hartes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these tiles, as our best armour of proofe, protesting vpon our soules and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and calling Almightie God and his Angels to witnesse, that as we hope to haue any benefit by the most precious woundes, and death of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: the whole and onely intent of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into this Realme, is no other; but to labour for the saluation of soules, and in peaceable and quiet sort, to confirme them in the ancient Catholike faith, in the which theyr forefathers liued &amp; died, these thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foure hundred yeares, out of which we vndoubtedly beleeue it is impossible that any soule should be saued.</p>
            <p>This from the sincerest of our thoughts, before the throne of God, wee must truelie professe, intending if no other remedie may be had, to let your Maiestie seale it vvith the best blood that our faithfull, &amp; faultles harts can afford. And if any be so hardened in a set incredulitie, as rather to condemne vs to periurie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cleare vs vpon so deep an oath, we will make reason his guide into our intentions, by which if he think vs not as much perished in our wittes, as he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

vs to be in our fidelitie, he shall easilie see the truth of our protestation: for first, treason being an offence that carrieth with it selfe a staine of infamie, as can neuer be taken out, and maketh them that commit it dead, &amp; vnpardonable persons. Who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagine any so foolish, desperate, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre so reprochfull a crime full of certaine perils hauing no other possible marke for his hope, but the vttermost of worldlie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. And if any one should chaunce to be so farre distracted from his sence, and to throw himselfe into so bottomles a destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet that so many, and so learned, &amp; so graue men, as dayly suffer for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in Priestes, would cast away their labours, liues and credittes, for nothing but a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and eternall reproch; our bitterest eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie would neuer deeme it likelie, and what other inticement shuld allure vs to be trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not any perswation that our selues can compasse so great an exploit, (there being scarce 300.

Not the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be aduaunced by forraine power: for then we would rather expect the conquest, till the time and oppertunitie were ripe, for vs to enter vpon our hopes, then so vente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to presse vpon the swordes of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies, and hazard not only our future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, but our present safeties, wee would rather liue abroad, though it vvere with as hard shifts, as those that now possesse honorable romes did once at <hi>Ceneua</hi>: then leopard our welfare, to so many so knowne and vneuitable harmes, which we are more likely soone to feele, then so long to eschue. And if wee were to come as rebels into the Realme, our education in Colledges should be aunswerable to the qualities, we should be trained in martiall exercises, busied in publike and ciuell affaires, hardened to the field, &amp; made to the weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whereas 1000. eares and eyes are witnesses, that our stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are nothing els but Philosophie &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, our teachers religious men, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with no other knowledge but learning and vertue, all our warlike preparations, the wresting for our wils, the mortifying of our

            <p>No no, most Gratious SOVERAIGNE, Heauen and Earth shall vvitnesse vvith vs in the dreadfull day of doome, that our breastes neuer harboured such horrible treasons, and that the end of our comming is the saluation of soules, not the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of bodies, wee beeing rather willing to die, then to contribute the least haire of our head to the latter, and not so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

            <p>Let it be scanned with equitie, how little seeming of truth it carrieth, that so manie should vpon so improbable and vncertaine expectations, offer their liues to most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and certaine shipwracks. And can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imagine vs to be so simple, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see how impossible it is for Catholikes to do the king any good, though they were as much bent that vvay as their accusers would haue it thought: doe we not see that they are scattered one among thousandes, and at all such accurrants so well watched, and so ill prouided: that to vvish them to stirre in the Kinges behalfe, were to traine them to their vndoing, &amp; to expose them to a generall massacer by domesticall furie, and what better aduocate can plead for vs in this case, then your Maiesties own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, who in the last attempt of the king, found none more forward to doe all duties, and liberally to stretch theyr abilities, then Catholikes were in your highnes defence, and though they were ceassed for men and money, farre aboue their reuennewes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19552:15"/>
and so fleeced of theyr armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, that they were left vnfurnished, for their owne sauegards: yet were they so far from mutining, or touch of disloyaltie, that they willingly yeelded more, then any other of their qualitie, vvhich doubtlesse if Priests had sworne them with othes, or bound them with Sacraments, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie they would neuer haue done: sith they venture both liues and liberties, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charitable works of farre lesse weight, then the auoyding of the damnable sinnes, of periurie and sacriledge. It is also vvell knowne euen vnto the Coyners of these vntrue surmises, that if the King should come so slenderly prouided, as to need the handfull of Catholikes helps, (who neyther haue conntenance, charge, nor authoritie in the common wealth) your Maiestie neede not greatly feare, sith it were impossible he should be strong, to whome so weake, and bootles a succour should be necessarie. And to what effect should wee then perswade Catholikes to leaue theyr obedience to your Highnes, sith it can neyther benefit vs, nor auaile them: but rather draw vpon vs, both a manifest subuersion: yea did we not rather strengthen them in their duties,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19552:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>

And so far was this vnfortunate wretch giuen ouer to desperate malice, that first to possesse him more of M.

It is strange to marke with what cunning the graue and wiser sort of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, were sounded a far off, not by reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any direct intention: but so nicely gla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It is further knowen that the coppie of that letter which <hi>Babbington</hi> sent to the Queene of Scots, was brought ready penned by <hi>Poolie,</hi> from M.

No saith he, you shall haue but 14. for if I should grant you any more, it would be to your hinderance, as you shal heare hereafter: wherein he said true, for much about that time, was publike notice taken of <hi>Babbingtons</hi> matter, all waies vvere watched, infinite houses searched, hewes &amp;

cries raised, frights bruted in the peoples eares, and all mens eies filled with a smoke, as though the whole Realme had beene on fire, whereas in trueth, that was but the hissing of a fewe greene twigs, of their own building, which they might without any such vprore haue quenched with a handful of water, but that made not so much for their purpose as this buggish terible shows: and thought they were so well acquainted with all the Gentlemens hearts, that they might euery houre in the daye or night, haue drawen them in the nette like a couie of partridges. Yet forsooth, must some of them be suffred purposely to flee that they might haue the better colour to make those generall demonstrations of a needles feare. <hi>Iohn Sauage</hi> likewise when he came to the Courte, was so wel knowen to be a chicken of that feather, that two <hi>Pentioners</hi> were charged to haue an eie vnto him, and to watche so long as he stayed there, and yet was he suffered to goe vp and downe, and vsually to haunt the presence, till all irons were hotte that were laide in the fire, to feare the credite of poore Catholickes, and to giue the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Scottes</hi> her deathes wounde: it was also noted, that after <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi>

Of which <hi>Iohn Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocke</hi> at the barre saide the reason to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the older, the colder, yet the true grounde was a speciall promise of Master Secretary to keepe the threede out of their handes that woulde soone haue vnwounde it to the bottome, for what man that had but knowne the first sillable of pollicye, woulde thinke it a likelye course for them, to alter the whole state of so great a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to quite contrarye Religion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernmente, that neither hadde power to backe them, (as then there was none rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, nor helpes at home to support them) being al but priuate gentelmen, (neither of wealth, nor sufficient credit for such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) to carry with them any great numbers,

who would not haue pittied their indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that intending so great an alteration, thought it a fit way to goe pickeing here &amp; there one, as if such plots in so many young tongues could lie hidden so long, as to giue them respite to gleane a sufficient army. And for men that pleadged their heades in so daungerous attempts, to be so credulous, as to rest their hopes vpon so fliting &amp; faire promises of forraine helps, without the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of such preparation of shippes &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as might come in due time to followe their beginnings, was a most childishe sight. And therefore for any man of experience that had looked to it, there would haue offered it selfe a iust suspition, that the plotte was rather a traine to entrappe the actors in it, than a meane to effect that intended by it. For though they had cut off some of the Councell: yea, and dismantled the realme of your sacred maiesty, (which Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse neither woulde, nor we hope wil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) yet had their purpose beene farre from any semblance of their desired issue, for then they must haue proclaimed either the Queene of <hi>Scotts,</hi> or at least by some means haue sought her deliuery, &amp; consequentlie haue notified to the worlde that for her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

was your Maiesties going downe. And what a tide of resistance would this notice haue done, none can be so seely but he must needs see. For first by the oath of associatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, al the Nobility had bin bound, to persist hir to death, which many without an oth would otherwise haue beene apte enough to doe. The crowne also beeing lefte without anie declared owner, a faire goale for them that runne first at it, no doubte but diuerse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors woulde haue hindered her course, to haue made her hopes-way to so faire an aime. Then the act of PARLIAMENT excluding straingers from the Crowne, (as she by diuerse meanes was diuoulged to be) woulde also haue added dainger to her claime, especially considering the auncient &amp; deepe rooted dislike, betweene the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishe</hi> and the <hi>Englishe,</hi> no small motiue to a popular mutiny: but most of all her vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency in the Catholicke religion, (against which both the Nobility, Cleargy, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were most violently bent) woulde haue made them ready in that respecte, to take heed of the least of these lettes, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her from the Crowne, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the title to some other more suteable, to their beleefe. All which impedimentes

and to haue tempted him to renue the war, by promising many thousands that shoulde be in England ready to aide them, concerning which there needeth no more to be said, but that the penitents that made the confession, knew wel enough that they were not with their right ghostly father, or else they woulde neuer haue committed such a sacriledge, abusing the Sacramentes with such vntrueths. For we are assured by their notice, who were more internal &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant with them both, than the authors of this confession euer coulde be, that they are sufficiently enformed of the estates of Catholikes, the one by experience, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by continuall reports of those that goe ouer. And therefore neither in pollicy, in which they are noe punies, nor honesty on which their creeit doth lye, would they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer such follies into Princes eares, which all protestantes hearing by so many attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neies, (as all protestants doe) were able to disproue them of falsehood, for neither are the restraints, and number of Catholikes so secret, nor the course to suppresse them so vnknown, but euery Prince seeth it an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility for them to doe any thing, being as before is shewed, so naked and needy, &amp;

be such, that eyther the King must stand vpon the strength of his owne force, or the sorrie addition of theyr impotent succour, which can neuer inable him to contriue his endeuours. Finally, both <hi>Cardinal Allen,</hi> and Father <hi>Parsons,</hi> are knowne generally to be men of excellent gifts, and no such nouices in the knowledge of Princes intelligencers, as in the weighty pointes of alteration of States, &amp; inuasion of Kingdomes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to delude them with impudent asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, knowen to themselues to be false, as the informer acknowledgeth this to bee. And if effects, the most infallible testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of intentions, may beare the deserued credit against naked &amp; vnprouided words of this partiall Inditor, Father <hi>Parsons</hi> hath by euident demonstrations of a loyal mind, sufficiently cleared himselfe from such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due suspitions: for hauing by his wisedome &amp; rare parts, purchased more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credit with the King of Spaine. All that haue bin eye witnesses of his proceedinges, can auouch, that he hath vsed the kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour euery way to the benefit, but no vvay to the preiudice of your Maiesties subiects.

And though it rest not in a priuate mans power, to stay the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of so mightie a Prince, in so generall, and important an enterprise, as is war with England.

some of them languishing a-way with the commodities of their inclosure, haue by a patient death obtained the best liberty, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers yet after many yeeres indurance, for no other cause but for Religion, beeing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered liberty if they would goe to Church.

neither dare reuenge their own quarrels for fear of double offence to god &amp; your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nor hope to haue redresse in ordinary course, so far hath disfauor excluded them, from all needfull remedies: yet must your Maiesty be informed, (so vncharitable are our enimies) that we suffer nothing for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whom onely in respecte of Religion these neglected miseries haue made most contemptible euery one doing vs wrong, to please our superiours, whom they see care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in yeelding vs any right. Nowe howe vndutifull an impeachment it was to the credit of your Maiesties words &amp; writings, to publish vnder your Soueraigne title, that Catholikes for Religion are not impeached in their goods or lands, I leaue to effects to proue. And what is our recusancie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall, to be present at their protestants ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, but a meere matter of conscience, for as there is none so knowne, or vsuall a way to distinguishe any religion from other, as the externall rites and Sacraments peculiar to euery one, so can none more effectually denie his owne than by making open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a contrary speech by his assistance &amp; present at the solemnities &amp; seruice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it. For not onely he that denieth

Christ in his heart, but he also that denieth or is ashamed of him, shall in the latter day be denied of him before his Angells. And seeing men iudge best of our minds, by our actions, we cannot possibly giue any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter profe vnto them, that we are no Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, than if we ioine with Protestantes, in their Churches &amp; seruice, by which, as then most certaine and speciall markes, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues are knowne to be of that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

hart, neuer hardned to see lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table spoiles would rather haue the lawes repealed, than the execution so intollerable. It is not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to expresse in words the continual hel we suffer by the merciles searching &amp; stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of purseuants &amp; such needy officers, that care not by whose fall they rise, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any deserts or other degrees, to clime to the hight of their ambition, but by the punishment &amp; paines of poore Catholikes. They water their fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains with the showres of our tenderest vaines, &amp; builde their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with the ruines of ours, tempering the morter of their foundations, with our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blod: our liuings are but snares for the owners liues, commonly made the fee of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mercenary mouth, that can by sounding our disgraces into credulous eares, procure themselues warrants to seaze vpon our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. They make our willes before we be sicke, bequeathing to their owne vses, what share they like, &amp; by displa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting our ofspring adopt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be heirs of our lands, beg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing &amp; broking for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if we were either conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for fooles, or in perpetuall mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, &amp; not contented with our wealth, they persecute our liues, neuer thinking their possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sure, til the assurance be seasoned

with our death. So easie it is for our enimies to quench their angry thirste in our blood: yea we are made so common forage for all hungry cattell, that euen the theeues with scutchins &amp; counterfait warrants, haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of purseuants spoiled vs in our houses, hauing the officers to assiste the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their robberies, so ready they are at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones call, to practise their autority to our vexation, and so well knowne it is to euery way beater howe openly Catholikes lye to the pray. And though some very fewe finde more fauor being able to follow it with gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den petitions, yet al the rest, whose meaner estates ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reach the charge of such cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friends, are made common blottes, open to euery chance of the dice, to giue entry to their aduersaries, by their displeasing their owne seruantes &amp; tennantes crowing ouer them, and vaunting that euerie pawne may giue their mate to their highest fortune: for be he neuer so base that playeth with them, with the least aduantage, he is sure that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will backe him in it, and haue the tricke with a sure help, thogh it be the son that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth against his father, or any faulty drudge that for feare of correction accuseth his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.

of our afflictions, in which, what way soeuer we go, it is but a loosing of our selues &amp; a vvinding of vs further into an endles course of calamities. Let this suffice, that now so heauie is the hand of our superiours against vs, that we generally are accounted men, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is a credit to pursue, a disgrace to protect, a commodity to spoile, againe to torture, &amp; a glory to kill. We presume that your Maiesty seldome or neuer heareth the truth of our persecutions, your lenitie and tendernes being knowne to be so professed an enimy to these cruelties, that you would neuer permit their countenance, if they were but expressed to your highnes as they are practised vpon vs: yet sith we can bring the ruine of our houses, the consumption of our goods, the pouerty of our estates, &amp; the weeping eyes of our desolate families, for palpable witnesses of the truth of these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Let vs not be so farre exiled out of the limets of all compassions, as besides all other euils to haue it confirmed with your Maiesties hand, that wee suffer no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for religion, suffering in proofe all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, for nothing els: we haue beene long enough cut from all comforts, &amp; stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an endlesse taske of sorrowes grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
