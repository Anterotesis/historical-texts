         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHen the Author Writ
the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
he had a deſign,
as appears by ſome
paſſages in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
to publiſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with it ſome
things, which he had divers years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
provided for an Appendix to the

               <hi>Phyſico-Mechanical</hi> Treatiſe about the
Aire: But part of the Appendix
conſiſting of Experiments, which the
Authour has ſeveral times made, but
truſting to his memory, did not think
it neceſſary to Record, when he came
to recollect particulars, he found that
ſome years which had paſs'd ſince di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them were try'd, and variety
of intervening occurrents, had made
it unſafe for him to rely abſolutely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Memory for all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
fit to be ſet down in the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
part of the deſign'd Appendix.
And therefore he reſolv'd to repeat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Experiments and Obſervations,
that he might ſet down their Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
whil'ſt they were freſh in his
Memory, if not objects of his ſenſe.
But though, when he Writ the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Preface<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did it upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
ſuppoſition, that he ſhould ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
be able to repeat the intended
<pb facs="tcp:98187:3"/>
Tryals, yet his Expectation was ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſappointed by that heavy, as well
as juſt, Viſitation of the Plague which
happened at <hi>London</hi> whil'ſt the Author
was in the Country: and which much
earlier then was apprehended, began
to make havock of the People, at ſo
ſad a rate that not only the Glaſs-men
there were ſcatter'd, and had, as they
themſelves advertis'd him, put out
their Fires, but alſo Carriers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ways of Commerce (ſave by the
Poſt) were ſtrictly prohibited betwixt
the parts he reſided in and <hi>London;</hi>
which yet was the only place in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

Treatiſe being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
impos'd on me by
the Royal Society, the
Reader will, I hope,
need no more then this
intimation, to keep him
from wandering to find ſome paſſages Word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as parts of a Diſcourſe pronounce'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an Aſſembly, it being not unuſual
(though not neceſſary) to preſent either in
writing or by word of mouth, together with
the Experiments made before that Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Company, an Hiſtorical account of Them.</p>
            <p>But becauſe 'tis probable, that ſome
Readers will deſire to be ſatisfied about o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars, relating to the publication
of this Treatiſe, I preſume it will not be
amiſs, both to ſay ſomething of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb facs="tcp:98187:5"/>
why I publiſh it as the firſt part of
the preſent Appendix to my Phyſico-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Experiments, and to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the manner of writing it.</p>
            <p>I had quickly both an opportunity and an
Invitation to enlarge the papers I was to
read, beyond the Limits of a bare deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Phaenomena, and matters of fact,
by my having been through ſome interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Accidents ſo hindered from exhibiting
them altogether, that I was deſir'd to bring
in an Accompt in Writing, that might be
Regiſtred (how little ſoever worthy of ſuch
Company) in the Societies Collection of
Philoſophical Papers, for the ſake of thoſe
Members who could not be preſent at all
the Experiments: So that finding ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements
expected from me, I was eaſily
induc'd to add the Explications of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
I deſcrib'd, whilſt I perceiv'd that
by a ſmall addition of pains I might much
gratifie divers Ingenious Friends that were
not ſo well vers'd in Hydroſtaticks as in the
other parts of real Learning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98187:5"/>
Having thus been induc'd to enlarge the
Account of my Experiments till it had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the bulk 'tis now arriv'd at, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
I was without much difficulty perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that to ſuffer it to paſs
abroad<note n="*" place="margin">About this paſſage, See the Publiſher, to the Reader.</note> in the Company of
the Appendix wherewith 'tis
publiſh'd, would not prove unacceptable to
the Curious, no more then an improper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to the reſt of my Appendix, and
that for ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
            <p>For (firſt) the Hydroſtaticks is a part
of Philoſophy, which I confeſs I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as one of the ingeniouſeſt Doctrines that
belong to it. Theorems and Problems of
this Art, being most of them pure and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
productions of Reaſon duly exercis'd
on attentively conſider'd Subjects, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in them ſuch Diſcoveries as are not
only pleaſing, but divers of them ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and ſuch as would make one at firſt
wonder by what kind of Ratiocination men
came to attain the knowledg of ſuch unobvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:98187:6"/>
Truths. Nor are the delightfulneſs,
and the ſubtilty of the Hydroſtaticks, the
only things for vvhich vve may commend
Them: For there are many, as well of the
more familiar, as of the more abſtruſe Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of Nature; that will never be
throughly underſtood, nor clearly explion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by thoſe that are ſtrangerste the Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticks;
upon whoſe Principles depend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
many other things, the Explications of
moſt of the Phyſico. Mechanical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we have ventur'd to preſent the
Publick, and the Deciſion of thoſe many
Coutroverſies, which they, and the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
of the Torrecellian Experiment
have occaſion'd among the Modern Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
into Nature.</p>
            <p>But the uſe of this Art is not alone
Speculative, but Practical, ſince not onely
the propoſitions it teaches, may be of great
importance to Navigation, and to thoſe that
inquire into the magnitudes and gravities
of Bodies, as alſo to them that deal in Salt
<pb facs="tcp:98187:6"/>
workes: But that the Hydroſtaticks may
be made divers ways ſerviceable to the
Chymiſts themſelves, to whoſe Art
that Doctrine ſeems to be ſo little of Kin,
I might here manifeſt, if I
could think it fit to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe,
what I have<note n="*" place="margin">Chiefly, in ſeveral places of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſh'd part of the Treatiſe of the oſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philoſophy.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
deliver'd to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>But that which invited me to Write ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this part of Philoſophy, is, not
only that I think it conſiderable, but that,
notwithſtanding its being ſo, I find it but
very litle, and not very happily cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For being not look'd upon as a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
purely Mathematical, the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Mathematicians have not in their
Writings ſo much as taken notice of it,
much leſs improv'd It. And ſince the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<hi>Archimedes,</hi> who, in his little
Tract <hi>De inſidentibus humido,</hi> has left
us three or four very excellent propoſitions,
(but proved by no very eaſie Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
<pb facs="tcp:98187:7"/>
among divers others that have more of
Geometrical Subtility, then uſefulneſs,
Thoſe Mathematicians, that, (like <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Ghetaldus, Stevinus,</hi> and <hi>Galileo)</hi>
have added anything conſiderable to the
Hydroſtaticks have been (that I know of)
very few, and thoſe too, have been wont
to handle them, rather as Geometricians,
then as Philoſophers, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
them to the explication of the
Phaenomena of Nature. And as for the
Peripateticks, and other School-Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
though on ſome Occaſions, as
when they tell us, That water weighs not
in water, nor aire in aire, they deliver
aſſertions about matters belonging to the
Hydroſtaticks, (which term, in this
Treatiſe, I often take in a large ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
moſt of the things delivered about the
weight of Bodys may by eaſy variations,
be made applicable to other Fluids) yet they
are ſo far from having illuſtrated, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
them, that they have but broach'd or
<pb facs="tcp:98187:7"/>
credited, divers of the moſt erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
that are entertain'd about them. So
that, there being but few Treatiſes written
about the Hydroſtaticks, and thoſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bound up among other Mathematical
works, and ſo written, as to require Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Readers, this uſefull part of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
has been ſcarce known any farther
then by name, to the genèrality ev'n of thoſe
Learned men, that have been inquiſitive into
the other parts of it, and are deſervedly
reckoned among the ingenious Cultivators
of the modern Philoſophy. But this is not
all, For ſome eminent men, that have of
late years, treated of matters Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;
having been prepoſſeſs'd with ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renous
Opinions of the peripatetick School,
and finding it difficult, to conſult expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
about the truth of their Concluſions,
have interwoven divers erroneous Doctrines
among the ſounder propoſitions, which they
either borrow'd from <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and
either circumſpect Mathematicians, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
<pb facs="tcp:98187:8"/>
themſelves, and theſe miſtakes being
deliver'd in a Mathematical dreſs, and
mingled with Propoſitions demonſtrably
true, the Reputation of ſuch Learned Men,
(from which I am far from deſiring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,)
and the unqualifiedneſs of moſt
Readers, to examine Mathematical things,
has procur'd ſo general an entertainment
for thoſe Errors, that now the Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
is grown a part of Learning, which
'tis not only difficult to attain, but dangerous
to Study.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, though neither the Occaſion
and deſigne of this Treatiſe exacted, nor
my want of skill and leaſure qualified me
to Write either a Body or Elements of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtaticks:
yet I hop'd I might doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
both towards the illuſtrating, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the reſcue of ſo valuable a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
by Publiſhing the enſuing Tract;
where I endeavour to diſprove the receiv'd
errors, by eſtabliſhing Paradoxes còn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to them, and to make the Truths
<pb facs="tcp:98187:8"/>
the better underſtood and receiv'd, partly
by away of Explicating them unimploy'd in
Hydroſtatical Books, and partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the things I deliver by Phyſical
and ſenſible Experiments. And over and
above this, the more to recommend Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticks
Themſelves to the Reader, I
have, beſides the Paradoxes, oppos'd to
the Errors I would diſprove, taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
by the ſame way, to make out ſome
of the uſefulleſt of thoſe Hydroſtatical
Truths, that are wont to ſeem ſtrange to
Beginners.</p>
            <p>If it be here demanded, why I have
made ſome of my Explications ſo prolix,
and have on ſeveral occaſions <hi>inculcated</hi>
ſome things. I anſwer, That thoſe who are
not us'd to read Mathematical Books, are
wont to be ſo indiſpos'd to apprehend things,
that muſt be explicated by Schemes, and
I have found the generality of Learned
men, and ev'n of thoſe new Philoſophers
that are not skill'd in Mathematicks, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:98187:9"/>
much more unacquainted, then I before
imagin'd both with the principles and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems
of Hydroſtaticks, and with the ways
of explicating and proving them, that
I fear'd, that neither the Paradoxes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that I maintain, nor the Hypotheſes
about the weight and preſſure of the aire,
upon which, little leſs then my whole Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Book depends, would be throughly
underſtood without ſuch a clear Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of ſome Hydroſtatical Theorems, as
to a perſon not vers'd in Mathematical
writings, could ſcarce be ſatisfactorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
in few words. And therefore,
though I do not doubt, that thoſe who are good
at the moſt compendious ways of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
will think, I might in divers places,
have ſpar'd many words without injury to
my proofs, and though I am my ſelf, of
the ſame mind I exſpect to find them of;
yet, I confeſs that 'twas out of choice that
I declind that cloſe and conciſe way of
writing, that in other caſes I am wont moſt
<pb facs="tcp:98187:9"/>
to eſteem. For Writing now not to
credit my ſelf, but to inſtruct others,
I had rather Geometricians ſhould not
commend the ſhortneſs of my Proofs,
then that thoſe other Readers, whom
I chiefly deſign'd to gratifie, ſhould not
throughly apprehend the meaning of
them.</p>
            <p>But this is not all for which I am
to excuſe my ſelfe to Mathematicall
Readers. For ſome of them, I fear,
will not like that I ſhould offer for
Proofs ſuch Phyſical Experiments, as
do not alwayes demonſtrate the things,
they would evince, with a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
certainty and accurateneſſe;
and much leſs will they approve, that I
ſhould annex ſuch Experiments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the Explications, as if Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
and Schemes, well reaſon'd on,
were not ſufficient to convince any
rational man about matters Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98187:10"/>
In Anſwer to this I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,
that in Phyſical Enquiries it is
often ſufficient that our determinations
come very near the matter, though they
fall ſhort of a Mathematical Exactneſs.
And I chooſe rather to preſume upon the
equity of the Reader, then to trouble him
and my ſelf with tedious Circumlocutions,
to avoid the poſſibility of being miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
or of needing his Candor. And
we ſee, that even Mathematicians
are wont, without finding any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
thereby, to ſuppoſe all perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Lines, made by pendulous Bodies,
to be parallel to one another: Though
indeed they are not; ſince, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
they would meet at the Centre of
the Earth: And to preſume, that the
Surface of every calme water, in a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
is parallel to the Horizon; and
conſequently, a Plain: Though, in ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
themſelves think it the portion of
a Sphere: And though alſo I have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
<pb facs="tcp:98187:10"/>
obſerv'd it to be higher, where
'tis almoſt contiguous to the ſides of the
Veſſel, then 'tis in other places.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſince we find that though
water will be uniformly rais'd in
Pumps to ſeveral heights, but not to
thirty five foot, and will in ordinary
open pipes, be almoſt of the ſame level
within and without, but not if the pipe
be extraordinary ſlender; Upon theſe,
and divers other ſuch conſiderations, I
may have ſometimes made uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
that ſeemed not poſitive and
determinate enough to be employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
matters to which Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
are thought applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
But I elſewhere give an account
of the ſcruples I have about ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
as they are wont to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to Phyſical matters. And, in the
preſent Paradoxes, I think I have not
done nothing, if in my Hydroſtatical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
I have made it appear, That in
<pb facs="tcp:98187:11"/>
Experiments made with ſuch Liquors and
Glaſſes, as I employed, the Rules will
hold without any ſenſible, or at leaſt any
conſiderable Error; for thereby we may
learn the Truth of many things, for the
main, though in ſome we ſhould not have
attained to the exactneſs of meaſures
and proportions, which yet our endeavors
may aſſiſt others to arrive at.</p>
            <p>And as for my confirmation of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical
propoſitions by Phyſical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
if ſome Readers diſlike
that way, I make no doubt but that
the moſt will not only approve it, but
thank me for it. For though, in pure
Mathematicks, he that can demonſtrate
well, may be ſure of the Truth of a
Concluſion, without conſulting Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
about it: Yet becauſe demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are wont to be built upon Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Poſtulates; and ſome things,
though not in Arithmetick or Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
yet in Phyſical matters, are
<pb facs="tcp:98187:11"/>
wont to be taken for granted, about
which men are lyable to ſlip into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes;
even when we doubt not of
the Ratiocination, we may doubt of the
concluſion, becauſe we may, of the
Truth of ſome of the things it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And this Conſideration, if there
were no other, will, I hope, excuſe me
to Mathematicians, for ventring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
ſome reaſonings that are given out
for Mathematical demonſtrations. For
I ſuppoſe it will be conſider'd, that
thoſe whoſe preſum'd Demonſtrations I
examine, though they were ſome of them
Profeſſours of Mathematicks, yet did
not Write meerly as Mathematicians, but
partly as Naturaliſts: ſo that to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Tenets, ought not to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thoſe, as well certain, as excellent
and moſt uſeful Sciences, pure Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
any more then that the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians
that follow the Ptolemaick, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernican,
the Tichonian, or other Syſtemes
<pb facs="tcp:98187:12"/>
of the world, Write Books to manifeſt
one anothers Paralogiſmes in Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
matters: And therefore (to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to what I was about to ſay) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be a ſatisfaction to a wary man
to conſult ſenſe about thoſe things that
fall under the Cogniſance of it, and to
examine by Experiences, whether men
have not been miſtaken in their Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Reaſonings, and therefore the
Learned <hi>Stevinus</hi> himſelf (the chief
of the Moderne Writers of Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks)
thought fit, after the end of his
Hydroſtatical Elements, to add in an
Appendix ſome Pragmatical Examples
(as he calls them) that is, Mechanical
Experiments (how cogent I now inquire
not) to confirm the Truth of his Tenth
Propoſition, to which he had, not far
from the beginning of his Book, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what he thinks a Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.
And, about the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
we are now upon, the following
<pb facs="tcp:98187:12"/>
Paradoxes will diſcover ſo many mistakes
of eminent Writers, that pretend to have
Mathematically demonſtrated what they
teach, that it cannot but make wary Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
(and 'tis chiefly to gratifie ſuch that I
publiſh this) be ſomewhat diffident of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
whoſe proofs they do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
And it cannot but, to ſuch, be of
great ſatisfaction to find the things, that are
taught them, verified by the viſible teſtimony
of Nature her ſelf. The importance of this
Subject, and the frequent Occaſion I have to
make uſe of this kind of Apology, will I
hope, procure me the Readers pardon if I
have inſiſted ſomewhat long upon it.</p>
            <p>After what has been hitherto diſcours'd,
'twil be eaſie for me to give an Account, why
I premiſed theſe Hydroſtatical Paradoxes
to the reſt of the Appendix, wherewith they
are<note n="*" place="margin">An Account of this paſſage alſo, may be had from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhers Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Reader.</note> now publiſh'd: For
ſince a great part of my
work in that Appendix, was
to be a further Explication
<pb facs="tcp:98187:13"/>
of ſome things delivered in the Book it is
ſubjoyn'd to, and the vindication of then
from invalid objections: And ſince I have
generally obſerv'd, that the objections that
have bin, either publickly or privately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
made againſt the explications &amp; reaſonings
contain'd in that Book, were wont to proceed
from unacquaintedneſs, either with the true
notion of the weight and ſpring of the aire, as
I maintain them, or with the Principles and
Theorems of Hydroſtaticks, or elſe from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Conceits about them; I thought it
would much conduce to both the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ends of my Appendix, If I clear'd up
that Doctrine to which my Experiments and
reaſonings have been all along Conſonant,
&amp; whoſe being either not known, or miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
ſeems to have occaſion'd the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that have been hitherto made againſt
the Hypotheſes I have propos'd, or the
Explications I have thence given. And
however, ſince the Proofs I offer for my
opinions are for the moſt part drawn from
<pb facs="tcp:98187:13"/>
Experiments new &amp; eaſie, and that my aim
is but to diſcover Truths, or make them out
by clearer explications, without ſuppoſing,
like thoſe I diſſent from, any thing that is
either <hi>precarious</hi> or <hi>ſcarce,</hi> if at all, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible;</hi>
I hope, that if I ſhould not prove
happy enough to reach my ends, yet the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
and Equitable Reader will approve
my Deſigne, and be advantaged by my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.
Of which ſome of the chiefeſt,
and ſome of the moſt difficult, having been
ſeen (divers of them more then once) by the
<hi>Royal Society</hi> it ſelf, or by inquiſitive
Members of it; it will, I preſume, be but a
reaſonable requeſt, if the Reader, that ſhall
have the curioſity to try them over again, be
deſired not to be haſty in diſtruſting the
matters of fact, in caſe he ſhould not be able
at firſt to make every thing ſucceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to expectation. For as eaſie as I have
endeavour'd to make theſe Experiments,
yet I dare not promiſe my ſelf that they
will all of them be priviledg'd from the fate
<pb facs="tcp:98187:14"/>
whereto I have obſerv'd other Phyſico-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
ones to be not ſeldome obnoxious
from ſome unheeded Phyſical Circumſtance,
by which thoſe that are not acquainted with
the ſubtleties of Nature, or, at leaſt for the
time, do not ſufficiently conſider them, are
apt to be impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>This Advertiſement will perhaps be beſt
illuſtrated, &amp; recommended by an inſtance.
And therefore I ſhall ſubjoyne one that will
poſſibly ſeem ſomewhat odd.</p>
            <p>It has been taken notice of by two or three
Ingenious modern Mathematicians, and I
have had occaſion to make it out by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Experiments, that warm water is lighter
<hi>in ſpecie</hi> then cold: whence it has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd,
that wax, and other Bodies, very near
aequiponderant with common water, will
ſwim in that which is cold, and ſinck in that
which is hot, or luke-warm. Which Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though as it may be (and perhaps it has
been) tryed, I readily allow to be agreeable
to the known Laws of the Hydroſtaticks;
<pb facs="tcp:98187:14"/>
Yet I have ſometimes undertaken that the
Tryal ſhould have a quite contrary event.
To this purpoſe having taken ſome yellow
Bees-wax, which was formed into a Pellet
of the bigneſs of a Cherry, and, by the help
of a little Lead, was made ſo near aequipon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derant
to cold water, that; being but a very
little heavier, a very ſmall diminution of
its weight would make it emerge, I remov'd
it out of the very cold water, into ſome that
had bin purpoſely made lukewarm, (or a
little more then ſo) where it quickly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to the wonder of the lookers on, appeard
to ſwim on the top of the water. And that it
might not be ſuſpected that it was ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by any viſible bubbles, which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
in ſome caſes, to buoy up even heavy
Bodies, and deceive the unſkilful, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive;
I briskly enough duck'd the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
2 or 3 times under water to throw them
off, notwithſtanding which it conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to float, and yet being remov'd again
into the ſame cold water it had been taken
<pb facs="tcp:98187:15"/>
out of, and duck'd as before to free it from
adherent bubbles, it lay quietly at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
and, though rais'd ſeveral times to the
upper part of the water, would immediately
ſubſide again, and fall to the very loweſt.
Now that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> invited me to promiſe an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
which ſeems to contradict the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of the Hydroſtaticks, was not any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrust
of thoſe principles themſelves, but a
conjecture, that as by warmth the water
would be made a little lighter in <hi>ſpecie</hi> then
'twas before; ſo by the ſame warmth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
and more agitable parts of the wax,
whoſe texture is looſe enough, would be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
(though not viſibly) expanded, and
would by that expanſion gain a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
towards floating, then the increas'd
lightneſs of the water would give it diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſinck. And I confirm'd this conjecture
by a farther experiment, which at firſt was
it ſelf ſomewhat ſurpriſing to the Beholders.
For when the wax was firſt taken out of the
cold water, &amp; immediately immers'd in the
<pb facs="tcp:98187:15"/>
warm, it would readily enough ſinck, &amp; being
(with a quill or a knife) rais'd to the top of
the water, it would again fall down, but more
ſlowly then at the begining, &amp; afterſome few
minutes, if it were rais'd to the upper parts
of the water, it would remain a float. (And I
have known it, when it had remain'd a while
longer at the bottom, ſo to emerge, that if I
were ſure no unheeded bubbles had been
newly generated, and held it up, it might be
ſaid to emerge of its own accord) as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, being put into the cold water as ſoon
as ever it was taken out of the warm, it would
at the very firſt float, and being then knock'd
downwards, it would, readily enough, regain
the upper part of the water, but if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
to ſend it downwards about 6 or 7
times (more or fewer) ſucceſſively, it would
emerge every time more ſlowly then other,
and at length not emerge at all, even when I
try'd it in water made heavy, by being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infrigidated with ſalt aud ſnow plac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Glaſs. Which Phaenomena I had
<pb facs="tcp:98187:16"/>
thought it reaſonable to expect, becauſe I
preſum'd, that the Wax being remov'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
out of the warm water, into the
cold, muſt require ſome time, to looſe the
adventitious expanſion, which the warmth
had given it, and muſt be depriv'd of it by
degrees, by the coldneſs of the water into
which the wax was transferr'd. As on the
other ſide, there muſt be ſome time neceſſary
for ſo little a warmth, as that of the tepid (or
little more then tepid) water, to give the
wax that addition of dimenſions (which alſo
it muſt receive by degrees) that was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
in ſpite of the rarefaction of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to make it float. I might add, that theſe
Tryals were repeated, for the main, with
more Bullets of wax then one, and that they
ſucceeded far otherwiſe, when, inſtead of a
piece of wax, we imploy'd a pois'd glaſs
bubble, in which the temperature could make
either no change at all, or no conſiderable
change of dimenſions. And to theſe I might
add other circumſtances, if I did not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:98187:16"/>
that I mention theſe Tryals but occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,
and to make the caution, formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to the Reader, appear not to be
impertinent, ſince a Hydroſtatical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
true in its ſelf, may eaſily miſcarry by
over-looking ſuch Circumſtances as 'tis not
eaſie to be aware of.</p>
            <p>But by this Advertiſement I would by
no means divert Men from being diffident of
Hydroſtatical Traditions and Experiments.
For, beſides the many Erroneous Opinions,
there are matters of fact, whoſe Truth, thò
not queſtion'd, but built upon, I think ought
to be brought to tryal. For, even whilſt I was
concluding this Preface, I found that divers
even of the Moderns, &amp; particularly a very
learned Man that has lately Writen of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtaticks,
have much troubled themſelves
to render a reaſon why, ſince, according to
their Doctrine, water weighs not in water,
Wooden veſſels, though of a ſubſtance ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then water, being by leaks, or otherwiſe,
fil'd with water, ſhould ſinck and remain at
<pb facs="tcp:98187:17"/>
the bottom of the water: whereas judging this
<hi>Phaenomenon</hi> diſagreable to what I look
upon as the Laws of the Hydroſtaticks, I
was confirm'd in that opinion, by having had
the curioſity to make ſome tryals of it, wtth
4 or 5 veſſels of differing ſhapes and ſizes,
whereof two were of wax, which, though a
matter but very little lighter then water, I
could not ſinck, or keep ſunck by pouring
water into them, or ſuffering them to fill
themſelves at leaks made near the bottom,
and if they were depreſſed by force or
weights, they, as alſo the wooden Veſſels,
would upon the removal of the impediment
(and ſometimes with the cavity upwards)
emerge. And I am the more ſolicitous to
have things in the Hydroſtaticks duly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain'd,
becauſe <hi>the weighing of bodies
in Liquors</hi> may hereafter appear to be one
of the general ways I have employ'd, and
would recommend, for the examining of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all ſorts of tangible Bodies.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O obey the orders of the
Society, that forbid the
making of Prefaces and
Apologies in Accounts
of the Nature of that
which you expect from
me; I ſhall without any further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
begin with taking notice, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98187:20"/>
upon peruſal of <hi>Monſieur Paſchall</hi>'s
ſmall French Book, which was put
into my hands, I find it to conſiſt of
two diſtinct Treatiſes: The one <hi>of the
AEquilibrium</hi> of Liquors, as he calls it;
and the other <hi>of the weight of the Maſs
of the Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for this latter, (which I ſhall
mention firſt, becauſe I can in very
few words diſpatch the little I have to
ſay of it) Though it be an ingenious
diſcourſe, and containes things, which
if they had been publiſhed at the time,
when it is ſaid to have been written,
would probably have been very well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to the Curious: yet I have very
little elſe to ſay of it in this place, in
regard that ſince that time, ſuch kind
of Experiments have been ſo proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that I preſume it is needleſs, and
would not be acceptable to repeat
what <hi>Monſieur Paſchall</hi> has written, in
this Society, which has ſeen the ſame
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98187:20"/>
Truths, and divers others of the like
Nature, more clearly made out by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
which could not be made
by <hi>Monſieur Paſchall,</hi> and thoſe other
Learned Men, that wanted the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of ſuch Engines and Inſtruments,
as have in this place been frequently
made uſe of.</p>
            <p>Wherefore having already at a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
meeting given you, by word of
Mouth, an account of <hi>Monſieur Paſchall</hi>'s
Ingenious Invention, of a pair of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
without vent, to meaſure the
various Preſſure of the Atmoſphaere;
I remember nothing elſe that needs
hinder me from proceeding to the other
part of his Book, <hi>The Treatiſe of the
AEquilibrium of Liquors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I find ſo ſhort, and ſo worthy
of the Author, that to give you all that
I judge worth taking notice of in it,
would obliege me to tranſcribe <hi>almoſt</hi>
the whole Tract; and therefore I ſhall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98187:21"/>
rather invite you to read the whole,
then divert you from the deſigne by
culling out any part of it; yet if you
will not be ſatisfied without ſomething
of more particular, I ſhall be oblig'd
to tell you, That the Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
partly of Concluſions and partly
of Experiments; the former ſeemed to
me to be almoſt all of them (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but few that I doubt of) conſonant
to the Principles and Lawes of the
Hydroſtaticks. But as for the latter,
the Experimental proofs he offers of his
opinions are ſuch, that I confeſs I
have no mind to make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſons why, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that I like moſt of <hi>Monſieur Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall</hi>'s
Aſſertions, I decline imploying
his way of proving them, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe though the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he mentions be delivered in ſuch
a manner, as is uſual in mentioning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98187:21"/>
matters of fact; yet I remember not
that he expreſly ſays that he actually
try'd them, and therefore he might
poſſibly have ſet them down as things
that <hi>muſt</hi> happen, upon a juſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that he was not miſtaken in his
Ratiocinations. And of the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of this Doubt of mine, I ſhall
ere long have occaſion to give an
inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether or no <hi>Monſieur
Paſchall</hi> ever made theſe Experiments
himſelf; he does not ſeem to have been
very deſirous, that others ſhould make
them after him. For he ſuppoſes the
Phaenomena he builds upon to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
fifteen or twenty foot under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And one of them requires, that
a Man ſhould ſit there with the End
of a Tube leaning upon his Thigh.
But he neither teaches us how a Man
ſhall be enabled to continue under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor how in a great Ciſtern full of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98187:22"/>
water, twenty foot deep, the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter
ſhall be able to diſcern the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations,
that happen to <hi>Mercury</hi> and
other Bodies at the Bottome.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Theſe Experiments
require not only Tubes twenty foot
long, and a great Veſſel of at leaſt as
many feet in depth, which will not in
this Countrey be eaſily procured, but
they require Braſs Cylinders, or Pluggs,
made with an exactneſs, that, though
eaſily ſuppoſed by a Mathematician,
will ſcarce be found obtainable from a
Tradeſman.</p>
            <p>Theſe difficulties making the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
propos'd by <hi>Monſieur Paſchall</hi>
more ingenious then practicable, I was
induc'd on this occaſion to bethink my
ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a far more Expeditious Way,
to make out, not only moſt of the
Concluſions wherein we agree, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that he mentions not; and this
with ſo much more eaſe and clearneſſe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98187:22"/>
That not only This Illuſtrious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
but perſons no more than mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
vers'd in the Vulgar principles
of the Hydroſtaticks, may eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
apprehend what is deſign'd to
be deliver'd, if they will but bring
with them a due Attention, and
minds diſpos'd to preferre Reaſon and
Experience to vulgar Opinions and
Authors; which laſt clauſe I annex,
becauſe the following Diſcourſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to confute ſeveral of thoſe, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
a right to except againſt their
Authority.</p>
            <p>It not being my preſent Task to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Elements, or a Body of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtaticks,
but only ten or twelve Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes,
which I conceive to be prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by this new way of making them
out, I ſhall, to avoid Confuſion, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
Them in as many diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
After each of which, I
ſhall indeavour in a proof, or an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98187:23"/>
to ſhow, both that it is
true, and why it ought to be ſo. To
all theſe I ſhall to avoid needleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,
premiſe a word or two by
way either of <hi>poſtulatum</hi> or <hi>Lemma.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe I remember to what
Aſſembly I addreſs This Diſcourſe, I
ſhall make uſe of no other then an eaſie
ſuppoſition I met with in a ſhort Paper
(about a Mercuriall Phaenomenon)
brought in a year or two ſince to this
Learned Society, by a deſervedly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Member of
it<note n="*" place="margin">That excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Dr <hi>Wallis, Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Profeſſor of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry.</hi>
               </note>, For though his
ſuppoſal be made
upon occaſion of an
Experiment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nature, then any of the enſuing,
it may be eaſily accomodated to my
preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This <hi>poſtulatum</hi> or <hi>Lemma,</hi> conſiſts of
three parts; the firſt of them more,
and the two laſt, leſs principal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98187:23"/>
Suppoſe we then, <hi>(Firſt)</hi> That if a
<hi>Pipe</hi> open at both Ends, and held per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
to the Horizon, have the
lower of them under Water, there
paſſes an Imaginary plain or Surface,
which touching that Orifice is parallel
to the Horizon; and conſequently pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
as to ſenſe to the upper Surface of
the water, and this being but a help to
the Imagination will readily be granted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To this it will be conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
that each part of this deſignable
ſurface, will be as much, and no more
preſs'd, as any other equal part of it,
by the water that is perpendicularly
incumbent on it. For the water or
other Fluid being ſuppoſed to be of an
homogeneous ſubſtance, as to gravity,
and being of an equal height upon all
the parts of the imaginary Surface;
there is no reaſon why one part ſhould
be more preſs'd by a perpendicular pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of that incumbent fluid, then any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98187:24"/>
other equal part of the ſame Surface
by another perpendicularly incumbent
pillar of the ſame or equal Baſis and
height, as well as of the ſame Liquor.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though whilſt our
imaginary Surface is equally preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all parts of it, the Liquor muſt
retain its former poſition; yet if any
one part comes to have a greater weight
incumbent on it, then there is upon
the reſt, that part muſt be diſplac'd,
or depreſs'd, as it happens, when a
ſtone or other Body heavier then water
ſincks in water. For wherever ſuch a
a Body happens to be underneath the
water, that part of the imaginary plain
that is contiguous to the lower part of
the ſtone, having on it a greater weight
then other parts of the ſame Surface,
muſt needs give way, and this will be
done ſucceſſively till the ſtone arrive at
the Bottom; and if, on the other ſide,
any part of the Imaginary Surface be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98187:24"/>
leſs preſs'd upon then all the reſt; it
will by the greater preſſure on the other
parts of the Surface be impell'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
till it have attain'd a height, at
which the preſſure (of the rais'd water,
and the lighter or floating Body (if any
there be) that leans upon it, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitates
together with it, upon the
ſubjacent part of the Imaginary Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face)
will be equal to that which
bears upon the other parts of the ſame
Surface.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this ſeems to be the
likelieſt thing to be Queſtion'd in our
Aſſumption,<note place="margin">This Experiment and the Explication of it, if to ſome they ſhould here ſeem ſomewhat obſcure, will be eaſily underſtood by the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to the firſt enſuing Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe.</note> though he
that conſiders it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
will eaſily enough
be induc'd to grant it:
Yet I ſhall here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to evince it Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally,
and that
by no other way of proof, then the
ſame I imploy all along this preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98187:25"/>
Take then a Cylindrical glaſs pipe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of a convenient Bore open at both Ends,
let the Tube be ſteadily held perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to the Horizon, the lower end
of it being two or three inches beneath
the Surface of a convenient quantity of
water, which ought not to fill the
Glaſs Veſſel that contains it. The
pipe being held in this poſture, 'tis
manifeſt, that the water within the
pipe, will be <hi>almoſt</hi> in a level with the
Surface of the water without the pipe,
becauſe the external and internal water
(as I am wont for Brevities ſake to call
them) have free intercourſe with one
another by the open Orifice of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
End of the pipe: yet I thought
fit to inſert the word <hi>almoſt,</hi> becauſe
if the pipe be any thing ſlender, the
Surface of the water in it, will always
be ſomewhat higher then that of the
water without it, for reaſons that 'tis
not ſo neceſſary we ſhould now inquire
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98187:25"/>
after, as 'tis, that we ſhould here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to have this taken notice of once for
all; That miſtakes may be avoided
without a troubleſome repetition of the
difference in heights of the Surface of
Liquors within pipes and without
them, in caſe they be any thing
ſlender.</p>
            <p>The pipe being held in the newly
mention'd poſture, if you gently poure
a convenient Quantity of Oyle upon
the external water, you ſhall ſee, That
as the Oyle grows higher and higher
above the Surface of That water, the
water within it, will riſe higher and
higher, and continue to do ſo, as long
as you continue to poure on oyle; Of
which the Reaſon ſeems manifeſtly to
be this; That in the Imaginary plaine
that paſſes by the Orifice of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
end of the pipe, all that is not
within the Compaſs of the Orifice, is
expos'd to an additional preſſure from
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98187:26"/>
the weight of the oyle which ſwims
upon the water, and that preſſure muſt
ſtill be increas'd, as there is more and
more oyle poured on; whereas a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
part of the Imaginary plain, equal
to the Orifice of the Glaſſe, is by
the ſides of the pipe fenc'd from the
immediate preſſure of the oyle; ſo that
all thoſe other parts of the water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
far more preſs'd, then that part
which is comprehended within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Tube: and conſequently the
preſs'd parts of the external water, are
by the equal gravitation of the oyle,
upon the parts of the external water,
impell'd up into the Cavity of the pipe,
where they find leſs reſiſtance, then
any where elſe, till they arrive at ſuch
a height, that the Cylinder of water,
within the pipe, do's as much gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon the ſubjacent part of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Surface, as the water and
oyle together, do upon every other
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98187:26"/>
equal part of the ſame Surface or plain.</p>
            <p>But as well the former <hi>Lemma,</hi> as this
Experiment, will be ſufficiently both
clear'd and confirm'd by the following
Explications; to which I ſhould for
that Reaſon forthwith proceed; Were
it not that, ſince divers paſſages of the
following Treatiſe ſuppoſe the Aire
to be a Body not devoid of weight,
which yet divers Learned adherents to
the Peripatetick Philoſophy do reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
deny, it ſeems requiſite to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſomething for the proof of this
Truth.</p>
            <p>And though I think the Arguments
we have imploy'd to that purpoſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
do ſtrongly evince it: yet if I may
be allow'd to anticipate one of my own
Experiments of the Appendix, I ſhall
give an inſtance of the weight of the
Aire, not lyable ſo much as to thoſe
invalid objections, which <hi>ſome of</hi> the
Ariſtotelians have made againſt thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98187:27"/>
Proofs, wherewith we have been ſo
happy, as to ſatisfie the learned'ſt even
of our profeſſed Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>We caus'd then to be blown at the
flame of a Lamp, a Bubble of glaſs,
(of about the bigneſs of a ſmall Hen-egge)
which, that it might be light
enough to be weigh'd in exact Scales,
ought to be of no greater thickneſs, then
is judged neceſſary to keep it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(when ſeal'd up with none but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much expanded aire in it) broken
by the preſſure of the ambient Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaere.
This bubble was (like a
Peare with its ſtemme) furniſh'd with
a very ſlender pipe of Glaſs, at which
it was blown, that it might be readily
ſeald up; and then (the Aire within it
being by the flame of the Lamp gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
rarified, as much as conveniently
could be) whilſt the Body of the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was exceeding hot, the newly
mentioned ſtemme was nimbly put into
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98187:27"/>
the middle of the flame; where, by
reaſon of its ſlenderneſs, the Glaſs,
which was exceeding thin, was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
melted; whereby the Bubble
was Hermetically ſeal'd up. This
Glaſs being permitted leaſurely to
coole, I could afterwards keep it by
me an hour, or a day, or a week, or
longer, if I thought fit; and when I
had a mind to ſhew the Experiment,
<hi>I</hi> put it in one of the ſcales of an exact
ballance, that would turn, perhaps
with the <hi>30th,</hi> or <hi>50th,</hi> or a leſſe part of
a grain; and having carefully counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois'd
it, <hi>I</hi> then warily broke off the
ſeal'd end, placing a ſheet of paper juſt
under the ſcale to receive the fragments
of the Glaſs: and putting in again
thoſe fragments, that ſcale wherein
the Glaſs was would conſiderably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate;
which it muſt do upon
the account of the Weight of Aire,
there being no other cauſe, either
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98187:28"/>
needful, or juſtly aſſignable, but the
weight of the Aire that ruſh'd into the
Cavity of the Glaſs, as finding leſs
reſiſtance there then elſewhere, by
reaſon that the included Aire had it's
ſpring much weakn'd by it's great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion.</p>
            <p>This Experiment I many times try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſometimes before ſome <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi>
and ſometimes before others; who all
allowed it to be concluſive. For here
it could not be objected as againſt the
weighing of Aire in a Bladder, (which
objections yet I could eaſily anſwer,
if it were <hi>now</hi> proper) that the aire
which ponderates, it ſtuff'd with the
Effluvia of him that blows the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and (beſides that) is not aire in
its Natural ſtate, but violently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.
For here 'tis the free aire, and
in it's wonted laxity, that makes the
Glaſs preponderate.</p>
            <p>And that there is a great Ingreſs of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98187:28"/>
the external aire, is evident by theſe
three Phaenomena. The <hi>one,</hi> that if you
lend an attentive Ear, you ſhall plainly
heare a kind of whiſtling noiſe to be
made by the external aire, as it ruſhes
violently in upon the breaking of the
Glaſs; The <hi>other,</hi> that the Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the aire, ſeal'd up in the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
being very great, there is a great
deal of ſpace left for the ambient aire
to fill upon its admiſſion; and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this Rarefaction may be gueſs'd
at, both by the breaking of ſuch bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
now and then by the preſſure of the
External aire, which is not competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aſſiſted by the Internal to reſiſt; and
alſo by the <hi>third</hi> Phaenomenon I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to take notice of, namely, That if,
inſtead of breaking off the ſeal'd end of
the Glaſs in the aire, you break it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water, that Liquor will, by the
Preſſure of the Atmoſphaere, be forc'd
to ſpring up like an artificial Fountaine
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98187:29"/>
into the Cavity of the Bubble, and fill
about three quarters of it. By which
laſt circumſtance I gather, that the
weight of the aire is more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then ev'n many, who admit the aire
to have weight, ſeem to imagine. For
we muſt not ſuppoſe, that all the aire
contain'd in the Bubble, when broken,
weighs no more then the weight requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
in the oppoſite Scale, to reduce the
Ballance to an Aequilibrium; ſince this
additional weight is onely that of the
aire, that intrudes on the breaking of the
glaſs; which aire, by the Obſervations
newly mention'd to have been made
with water, appears to be but about
three quarters of the whole aire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the broken Bubble; and yet,
according both to our Eſtimate,
and that of divers Virtuoſi, and ſome
of them eminent Mathematicians, when
the capacity of the Bubble was ſhort of
two cubical Inches, (and ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98187:29"/>
in other glaſſes,) the nice Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
we us'd, manifeſted the newly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Aire to amount to ſome times
near halfe a grain, and ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it.</p>
            <p>And becauſe one of the laſt Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that I made to this purpoſe,
with ſeal'd Bubbles was none of the
leaſt accurate, I ſhall conclude this
Subject with the following account
of it.</p>
            <p>A thin glaſs Bubble, blown at the
flame of a Lamp, and Hermetically
ſeal'd when the contained aire was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
rarified, was Counterpoiz'd
in a nice paire of Scales, and then the
ſeal'd <hi>apex</hi> being broken off, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into the ſame Scale, the weight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to be increas'd by the re-admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
aire, a pretty deal above 11/16;<hi rend="sup">ths</hi>, and
conſequently very near, if not full ¾ of
a graine: Laſtly, having by ſome ſlight
(for 'tis no very eaſie matter) fill'd it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98187:30"/>
with common water, we weigh'd the
glaſs and water together, and found the
latter, beſides the former, to amount
to 906 grains: ſo that ſuppoſing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our former Eſtimate, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by ſome Tryals, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted
aire, which amounted to ¾ of a
grain, fill'd but ¾ of the whole Cavity of
the Bubble, the aire that was in it,
when ſeal'd, poſſeſſing one quarter of
that Cavity, the whole aire contain'd
in the Bubble, may be reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd
to weigh a whole grain; in which
caſe we might conclude (abſtracting
from ſome little Niceties not fit to be
taken notice of here; as elſewhere) that
the water in our Experiment, weighed
very little more then nine hundred times
as much as an equal quantity of Aire.
And therefore, though we allow, that
in an Experiment ſo diligently made, as
this was, the aire praexiſtent in the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
did not adaequately poſſeſs ſo much
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98187:30"/>
as a fourth part, but about a fifth or a
ſixth of its Cavity, the aire will yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
ſo heavy, that this Experiment will
agree well with thoſe others, recorded
in another Treatiſe, wherein we aſſign'd
<hi>(numero rotundo)</hi> a thouſand to one, for
the proportion wherein the ſpecifick
Gravity of water exceeds that of aire.</p>

               <head type="sub">That in Water, and other Fluids, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
parts are preſs'd by the upper.</head>
               <p>PRovide a Glaſs veſſel of a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
height and breadth A. B. C. D.
fill'd with water almoſt to the Top;
Then take a glaſs Pipe, open at both
Ends, Cylindrical, and of a ſmall Bore,
(as about the eighth or ſixth part of an
Inch in Diameter.) Put the lower End
of this Pipe into clear Oyle or Spirit
of Turpentine; and having by Suction
rais'd the Liquor to what part of the
Pipe you think fit, as ſoon as it is there,
you muſt, very nimbly removing your
Lips, ſtop the upper Orifice with the
pulp of your finger, that the rais'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
may not fall back again: Then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98187:31"/>
taking the Pipe and that Liquor out of
the Oyle of Turpentine, place it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly
in the Glaſs of water, ſo
as that the Surface of the Oyle in the
Pipe be ſomewhat higher then that of
the water without the Pipe; and having
ſo done, though you take off your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the upper Orifice of the Pipe,
the Oyle will not fall down at the lower
Orifice, though that be open, but will
remain ſuſpended at the ſame height, or
near there abouts, that it reſted at
before.</p>
               <p>Now Oyle of Turpentine, being a
heavy Fluid, does, as ſuch, tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and not being ſtopp'd by the
Glaſs it ſelf, whoſe lower Orifice is
left open, it would certainly fall down
through the Pipe, if it were not kept ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
by the preſſure (upwards) of the
water beneath it. There appearing no
other Cauſe to which the Effect can
reaſonably be aſcrib'd, and this being
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98187:32"/>
ſufficient to give an Account of it, as we
ſhall preſently ſee. For that it is not
any contrariety in Nature, betwixt the
oyle and the water, as Liquors that will
not mingle, is evident from hence, That
if you had remov'd your finger when the
Pipe was not ſo deeply immers'd in the
Glaſs, but that the Surface of the oyl in
the Pipe was an Inch or two more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
above that of the water in the
Glaſs, then in our preſent caſe we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it to be; The Oyle, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
its preſum'd contrariety to water,
would have freely ſubſided in the Pipe,
till it had attain'd an aequipollency of
preſſure with the External Water.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon therefore of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon
ſeems to be plainly this. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the imaginary ſurface, on which
the Extremity <hi>Q</hi> of the pipe <hi>P Q</hi> leans,
to be <hi>G H.</hi> If that part of the Surface, on
which the Oyl leans at <hi>Q,</hi> be as much,
and no more charged, or preſs'd upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98187:32"/>
by the weight of the incumbent Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Oyle <hi>Q X,</hi> then the other parts
of the ſame imaginary Surface <hi>G H</hi>
are by the water incumbent on Them,
there is no Reaſon why that part at <hi>Q</hi>
ſhould be diſplac'd, either by being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
by the weight of the Cylinder of
Oyle <hi>X Q,</hi> or rais'd by the equal preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of water upon the other parts of
the Superficies <hi>G H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that this <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> betwixt
the Oyle and the Water, is the true
cauſe of the Phaenomenon, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by obſerving what happens, if
the altitude of either of the two Liquors
be alter'd in Relation to the other.</p>
               <p>And <hi>(Firſt,)</hi> we have already taken
notice, That if the Cylinder of Oyle
reach in the Pipe, much higher then
that of the Surface of the water, the
oyle will deſcend: Of which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, Becauſe the deſignable Surface
<hi>G H,</hi> being more charg'd at <hi>Q</hi> then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98187:33"/>
any where elſe, the part <hi>Q,</hi> being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to reſiſt ſo great a preſſure, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
be thruſt out of place by the
deſcending oyle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This ſubſiding will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
but till the Surface of the Oyle in
the Pipe be fallen almoſt as low as that
of the water without the Pipe; becauſe
then, and not before, the parts at <hi>Q</hi> are
but as much preſs'd by the oyle, as the
other parts of the Surface <hi>G H</hi> are
by the water that leans upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis a concluding Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to our preſent purpoſe, That if
the Oyle and Water being in an <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium,</hi>
you gently lift up the Pipe, as
from <hi>Q</hi> to <hi>S,</hi> the depth of the water
being leſſend, the oyle in the Pipe will
grow praeponderant, and therefore will
fall out in Drops or Globuls, which by
the greater Specifick Gravity of the
water, will be buoy'd up to the Top
of the Liquor, and there flote: And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98187:33"/>
ſtill as you lift up the Pipe higher and
higher, towards the Surface <hi>L M,</hi> more
and more of the Oyle will run out.
But if you ſtop the Pipe any where in
its Aſcent, as at <hi>S,</hi> the Effluxion of the
oyle will likewiſe be ſtopp'd. And at
the imaginary Superficies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>J K,</hi> as by
Reaſon of the ſhallowneſs of the water
from <hi>L</hi> to <hi>J,</hi> or <hi>M</hi> to <hi>K,</hi> the preſſure
of the water upon the other parts of
the Surface is not near ſo great, as it
was upon the Surface <hi>G H,</hi> where the
water had a greater depth: So by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the proportionate Effluxion of
the oyle, whil'ſt the Pipe was lifted up
from <hi>Q</hi> to <hi>S,</hi> the remaining Cylinder
of oyle incumbent on <hi>S,</hi> is not able
to preſs that part of the Superficies
<hi>J K</hi> more ſtrongly then the other parts
of the ſame Superficies, are preſt by the
water Incumbent on them. And if the
Pipe be lifted up till the lower Orifice
be almoſt rais'd to <hi>V;</hi> that is, almoſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98187:34"/>
as high as the uppermoſt Surface of the
water <hi>L M,</hi> ſo much of the oyle will,
for the Reaſon already given, run out,
that there will ſcarce be any left in the
Pipe <hi>T V.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But if when the Pipe reſts
at the Surface <hi>G H,</hi> where the oyle is
in an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> with the water; you
ſhould inſtead of lifting it from <hi>Q</hi> to <hi>S,</hi>
thruſt it down from <hi>Q</hi> to <hi>O;</hi> then the
External water would not only ſuſtaine
the oyle, but make it aſcend in the Pipe
to a height equal to the diſtance <hi>E G;</hi>
and ſo the Pipe will containe beſides a
longer Cylinder of oyle <hi>AE W,</hi> a ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one of water <hi>AE O.</hi> For the pipe
being transferr'd from the poſition <hi>P Q,</hi>
to the poſition <hi>O N,</hi> there is a new I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
Surface <hi>E F,</hi> that paſſes by
the lower Orifice of the Pipe. Now
the part of this Surface at <hi>O</hi> will not,
by the Incumbent oyle alone, be preſs'd
as much as the other parts of the ſame
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98187:34"/>
Surface are by the Incumbent water.
For the oyl alone was but in <hi>Aequilibrium</hi>
with the water, when it was no deeper
then <hi>L G,</hi> or <hi>H M;</hi> ſo that the other
parts of the Superficies <hi>E F,</hi> being
more preſs'd upon by the water, then
the part at <hi>O</hi> by the oyle, the oyle muſt
give place, and be buoy'd up by the
water, (which, if it were not for the
weight of the oyle, would be impell'd
up into the pipe full as high as the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the External water) till the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the admitted water <hi>O AE,</hi> and
the Cylinder of oyle <hi>AE W,</hi> do both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
gravitate as much upon the part
<hi>O,</hi> as the reſt of the Incumbent water
does upon the other parts of the ſame
Superficies <hi>E F.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly</hi> and laſtly, 'Tis very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to what has been delivered, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> of the oyle and
water in the pipe <hi>P Q,</hi> that the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<hi>X</hi> of the oyle in the pipe, will not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98187:35"/>
be of the ſame level with <hi>L M,</hi> that
of the External water, but a little
higher than it. For though the ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of the Pipe do ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to this Effect, yet there would
be an inequality, though not ſo great,
betwixt theſe Surfaces upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
That oyle of Turpentine being
in <hi>Specie,</hi> (as they ſpeak in the Schools)
that is bulk for bulk, a lighter Liquor
than Water, it is requiſite that the
height of it, incumbent on the part <hi>Q,</hi>
be greater than that of the water on the
other parts of the ſame Surface <hi>G H,</hi>
to make the preſſure of the oyle on the
part it leans upon, equal to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the water on the other parts of
the Surface. And if the inequality
were greater betwixt the Specifick
Gravities of theſe two Liquors, the
inequalities betwixt the Surface <hi>X,</hi> and
the Surface <hi>L M</hi> would be alſo greater,
as may be try'd by ſubſtituting for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98187:35"/>
water, oyle of Tartar <hi>per deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
which is a ſaline Liquor much
heavier than it. And that, in caſe the
Pipe containe not a lighter Liquor
then the External fluid, the Surface of
the Liquor in the Pipe will not be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than that of the Liquor without it,
we ſhall by and by have opportunity to
manifeſt by Experience.</p>
               <p>From what has been hitherto ſhewen,
we may ſafely infer the Propoſition, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whoſe occaſion all this has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.
For ſince the oyle in a Pipe,
open at both Ends, may be kept ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in any part under water, as at <hi>Q,</hi>
becauſe it is there in an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi>
with the External water; and ſince being
lifted up in the water, as from Q to <hi>S,</hi>
the oyle can no longer be kept ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but by its own gravity will runne
out. And ſince, in a word, the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the water is, the greater weight and
preſſure is requir'd in the Cylinder of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98187:36"/>
oyle, to be able to countervail the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the water, and keep it ſelf from
being lifted up thereby; there ſeems
no cauſe to doubt but that the parts of
the water incumbent on the Superficies
<hi>G H,</hi> do more preſs that Superficies,
than the parts of the water contiguous
to the Superficies <hi>J K</hi> do preſs that;
and <hi>conſequently,</hi> that the parts of the
water that are under the uppermoſt
Surface of it, are preſs'd by thoſe of
the ſame Fluid that are directly over
them: As we ſaw alſo that the upper
parts of the oyle, whil'ſt the pipe was in
raiſing from <hi>Q</hi> to <hi>S,</hi> depreſs'd the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſo much, as to force them quite out
of the Pipe; there being in theſe caſes
no reaſon why the lowermoſt parts of
a Liquor ſhould preſs more, or have a
ſtronger Endeavour againſt any other
Liquor (or any other Body) the higher
the Liquor incumbent reaches, if theſe
inferiour parts deriv'd their peſſure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98187:36"/>
from their own particular Gravity,
(which is no greater then that of the
other Homogeneous parts of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor)
and therefore they muſt derive the
great force wherewith they preſs from
the weight of the Incumbent parts,
which conſequently muſt be allow'd to
preſs upon them.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
propoſitions, it will not be amiſs
to mention here, once for all, a few ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements,
to avoid the neceſſity of
repeating the ſame things in the ſequel
of the Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is here ſaid of the
preſſure of the parts of water upon one
another, and the other Affections that
we ſhall attribute to it, in the following
paper, are to be apply'd to heavy Fluids
in general, unleſs there ſhall appear
ſome particular Cauſe of excepting
ſome of them in particular Caſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas I lately intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98187:37"/>
That the inequality betwixt the
Surfaces of the oyle in the Pipe, and of
the External water, was in part to be
aſcrib'd to the ſlenderneſs of the Pipe,
to be imploy'd in theſe Experiments,
I did it for this cauſe, that, whatever the
Reaſon of it be, (which we need not
here inquire after,) we are aſſur'd by
Experience, as we have elſewhere
ſhewn, That when Glaſs pipes come
to be ſlender, water and many other
Liquors (though not Quickſilver) will
have within them a higher Surface then
that of the ſame Liquor without them,
and this inequality of Surfaces (as far
as we have yet try'd) increaſes with the
ſlenderneſs of the pipe. But this, as to
our preſent Experiment, is a matter of
ſo little moment, That it may ſuffice
to have intimated that we did not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherefore, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this little inconvenience of ſlender
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98187:37"/>
Glaſſes, we think it Expedient to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
ſuch in the following Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
becauſe we found, that in thoſe
of a wide Bore, upon ſuch little ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualities
of preſſure as are not eaſily to
be avoided, the oyle and water will paſs
by one another in the Cavity of the
pipe, and ſo ſpoile the Experiment,
which requires that the oyle within the
pipe be kept in an intire and diſtinct
Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Common oyle and water,
or any other two Liquors that will not
mingle, may ſerve the turn in moſt of
theſe Experiments; but we rather chuſe
oyle of Turpentine, becauſe it is light
and thin, clear and colourleſs, and may
be eaſily had in quantities, and is not
ſo apt to ſpot ones Cloaths, or obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
to adhere to the porous Bodies it
chances to fall on, as Common, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expreſs'd oyles. And for their
ſakes to whom the odour is offenſive,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98187:38"/>
we preſently correct it, by mingling
with it a convenient quantity of oyle
of Rhodium, or ſome other Chymical
oyle that is odoriferous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Oyle of Turpentine, though
it be not reckon'd among the ſaline
Menſtruums, will yet (as we elſewhere
note) work upon Copper, and ſo by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting
it upon crude filings of that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
we obtaine a deep green Liquor,
which may be made uſe of inſtead of
the Limpid oyle, to make the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Liquors more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And for the ſame purpoſe
we often uſe inſtead of clear water, a
ſtrong Decoction of Brazill, or Logg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
or elſe Red Inck it ſelf, I ſay,
a <hi>ſtrong Decoction,</hi> becauſe unleſs the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
be ſo deeply ting'd, as to appear
Opacous in the Glaſs, when it comes
into the ſlender pipe, its Colour will
be ſo diluted, as to be ſcarce diſcernable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98187:38"/>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In the ſhape of the Glaſs
Veſſel, we need not be Curious; though
that of a wide Mouth'd Jarr, expreſs'd
in the Scheme, be for ſome uſes more
convenient than other ſhapes. The
depth of theſe Glaſſes, and the length
of the Pipes muſt be determin'd by the
Experiments, about which one means
to imploy them. To make out the
firſt Paradox already prov'd, a Glaſs of
about five or ſix Inches deep, and a
Pipe about as many Inches long, will
ſerve the turn: but for ſome others of
the following Experiments, tall Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
Glaſſes will be requiſite; and
for ſome, Broad ones likewiſe will be
Expedient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> One muſt not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
by not being able at the firſt
or ſecond time, to ſuck up oyle of
Turpentine to the due height, and ſtop
it with ones finger from relapſing; but
one muſt try again, and again; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98187:39"/>
ſince many Tryals of this kind may
be made in a few Minutes: and for
Beginners 'tis a ſafe and good, though
not the ſhorteſt way, to ſuck up rather
more Liquor then one judges will be
needful; becauſe having fill'd the Pipe
to that height, you may by letting in
the Aire warily and ſlowly, between
the Orifice of the Glaſs and the pulp
of your finger, ſuffer ſo much Liquor
to run out of the Pipe, as will reduce
it to the height you deſire; and there,
by cloſe ſtopping the Orifice with your
finger, you may keep it ſuſpended as
long as you pleaſe, and immerſe it into
any Heterogeneous Liquor, and take
it out again at pleaſure without ſpilling
any of it. By which ſlight Expedient
alone, I can decline ſeveral Difficulties,
and do many things, which, according
to <hi>Monſieur Paſchal</hi>'s way, require a
great deal of Trouble and Apparatus
to be perform'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:98187:39"/>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In ſuch Experiments where
it may be of uſe, That there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
diſparity betwixt the two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
Liquors, we may (as is above
intimated) inſtead of fair water, imploy
<hi>Oleum Tartari per deliquium,</hi> and tinge
it with Brazill or Chochineele; from
either of which, but eſpecially from
the latter, it will obtaine an exceeding
deep Redneſs: and where one would
avoid ſtrong ſents and oylineſs, he may,
if he will be at the Charge, imploy
oyle of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> inſtead of
fair water, and highly Rectified Spirit
of Wine, inſtead of oyle of Turpentine.
For theſe two Liquors, though they will
both readily mingle with water, will
not with one another; and if a great
quantity of ſome other Liquor be to
be ſubſtituted for ſimple water, when
theſe Chymical Liquors are not to be
had in plenty, one may imploy (as we
have done) a very ſtrong Solution made
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98187:40"/>
of Sea-ſalt, and filtred through Cap-paper:
this Brine being near about as
Limpid as common water, and farre
heavier than it. And for a Curioſity,
we have added to the two lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Liquors (oyle of Tartar, and
Spirit of Wine) ſome oyl of Turpentine,
and thereby had three Liquors of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Gravities, which will not by ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
be brought ſo to <hi>mingle,</hi> as not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to part again, &amp; retire each within its
own Surface; and by thruſting a Pipe
with water in the bottom of it (placing
alſo ones finger upon the upper Orifice)
beneath the Surface of the lowermoſt
of theſe Liquors, and by opportunely
raiſing or depreſſing it, one may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
vary the Experiment in a way not
unpleaſant; but explicable upon the
ſame grounds with the reſt of the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
mentioned in this Diſcourſe.</p>

               <head type="sub">That a lighter Fluid may gavitate or

               <p>I Know that this is contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

but ev'n of divers hodiern Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and Writers of Hydroſtaticks; ſome
of whom have abſolutely rejected this
Paradox, though they do but doubt of
the truth of the former.</p>
               <p>But when I conſider, that whether
the cauſe of Gravity be the pulſion of
any ſuperior ſubſtance, or the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

elſe it be, there is in all heavy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as ſuch, a conſtant tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

               <p>But to this I anſwer, That though in
Reſpect of the heavier Liquor, the
leſs heavy may in ſome ſence be ſaid
to be light; yet, notwithſtanding that
relative or Comparative Levity, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all its abſolute Gravity, tending
downwards as ſtrongly as before;
though by a contrary and more potent
Endeavour upwards of the contiguous
liquor (whoſe lower parts, if leſs reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
are preſſed upwards by the higher
elſewhere incumbent; according to the
Doctrine partly delivered already, and
partly to be cleared by the proof of the
next propoſition,) its endeavor down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is ſo ſurmounted that it is forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
carry'd up. Thus when a piece of
ſome light wood being held under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is let go and ſuffer'd to emerge,
though it he buoy'd up by the water,
whoſe ſpecifick Gravity is greater, yet
ev'n whilſt it alcends it remains a heavy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98187:42"/>
Body; ſo that the aggregate of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
&amp; the aſcending wood weighs more
then the water alone would doe; And
when it floats upon the upper part of
the water, as part of it is extant above
the ſurface, ſo part of it is immerſt
beneath it, which confirms what we
were ſaying, That a lighter Body may
gravitate upon a heavier.</p>
               <p>And thus there is little doubt to
be made but that if a man ſtand in one
of the ſcales of a Ballance with a heavy
ſtone ty'd to his hand, and hanging
freely by his ſide, if then he lift that
weight as high above his head as he
can, notwithſtanding that the ſtones
motion upwards makes it ſeem a light
Body in reſpect of the Man whoſe
Body it leaves beneath it, yet it dos
not, either during its aſcent or after,
looſe any thing of its connatural weight.
For the Man that lifts it up ſhall feel
its tendency downwards to continue,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98187:42"/>
though his force, being greater than that
tendency, be able, notwithſtanding that
tendency, to carry it up: and when it is
aloft, it will ſo preſs againſt his hand,
as to offend, if not alſo to bruiſe it; and
the Stone, and the Man that ſupports
it, will weigh no leſs in the Scale he
ſtands in, then if he did not at all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it, and they were both of them
weigh'd apart.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, if you put into one Scale
a wide mouth'd Glaſs full of water,
and a good quantity of pouder'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt; and into the other Scale, a
Counterpoiſe to them both; you may
obſerve, that, though at the beginning
the Salt will manifeſtly lie at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
and afterwards by degrees be ſo
taken up into the Body of the Liquor,
that not a grain will appear there; yet
nevertheleſs (as far as I can judge by
my Experiments) the weight in that
Scale will not be diminiſhed by the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98187:43"/>
weight of as much Sale as is inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
either carried up, or ſupported by
the reſtleſs motion of the diſſolving
Corpuſcles of the water; but both the
one and the other, (allowing for what
may evaporate) will concurrently gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate
upon the Scale that the glaſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them leans on.</p>
               <p>But of this more elſewhere. Now
to prove the propoſiion by the New
Method, we have propos'd to our ſelf
in this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Take a ſlender Glaſs pipe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuck'd up into it fair water, to the
height of 3 or 4 Inches, ſtop nimbly the
upper Orifice with your finger, and
inmerſe the lower into a Glaſs full of
oyle of Turpenrine, till the Surface of
the oyle in the Veſſel be ſomwhat
higher than that of the water in the
Pipe; then removing your finger,
though the Pipe do thereby become o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
at both Ends, the water will not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98187:43"/>
fall down, being hinder'd by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the oyle of Turpentine. As will
be obvious to them that have attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſider'd the Explication of the
former Paradox; there being but this
difference between this Experiment and
that there Explain'd, that here the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is in the Pipe, and the oyle in the
Veſſel, whereas there the oyle was in
the Pipe, and the water in the Veſſel.
And if you either poure more oyle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Glaſs, or thruſt the Pipe deeper
into the oyle, you ſhall ſee that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will be buoyed up towards the top
of the Pipe; that is, a heavier Liquor
will be lifted up by a lighter. And
ſince, by the Explication of the firſt
Propoſition, it appears, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why the Liquor is in this caſe rais'd
in the Pipe, is the Gravity of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
that raiſes it, we muſt allow that
a lighter Liquor in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> may by its
gravity preſs againſt a heavier.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98187:44"/>
And it agrees very well with our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
both of this, and of the firſt
Experiment, that as there, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the oyle in the pipe was always
higher than that of the water without
it, becauſe the oyle being the lighter Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
a greater height of it was requir'd
to make an <hi>Aequilibrium;</hi> ſo in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Experiment, the Surface of the
Liquor in the Pipe will alwayes be
lower than that of the oyle without it.</p>
               <p>For in the imaginary plain <hi>E F,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the ſecond Figure.</note> the Cylinder of water
<hi>J G,</hi> contain'd in the Pipe <hi>J H,</hi> will,
by reaſon of its greater gravity, preſs
as much upon the part <hi>J,</hi> as the diſtill'd
oyle <hi>(K E, J L,)</hi> being a lighter Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
can do upon the other parts of
the ſame ſuppos'd plain <hi>E F,</hi> though
the oyle reach'd to a greater height a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
it.</p>
               <p>This ſecond Paradox, we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been diſcourſing of, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98187:44"/>
prov'd by what we formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,
to make out the Truth of the
third part of the Lemma premiſed
to theſe Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this and the former
Paradox are of importance, not only
in themſelves but to the reſt of this
Treatiſe, and are likely (in moſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)
to meet with indiſpoſition enough
to be receiv'd, I will ſubjoyn in this
place a couple of ſuch Experiments,
as will not, I hope, be unacceptable;
that I devis'd, the one to confirm this
ſecond Paradox, and the other to
prove the firſt.</p>
               <p>Some of the Gentlemen now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
may poſſibly remeber, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of the Year that preceded
the two laſt, I brought into this place
a centain new Inſtrument of Glaſs,
whereby I made it appear, that the
upper parts of water gravitate upon the
lower; which I did by ſincking a Body,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98187:45"/>
that was already under water, by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more water upon it.</p>
               <p>But that Experiment belonging to
other papers, I ſhall here ſubſtitute ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perform'd by an Inſtrument,
which though it makes not ſo fine a
ſhew, may be more eaſily provided,
and will as well as that other (though
you were pleas'd to command that from
me) ſerve to make out the ſame Truth;
which I ſhall apply my ſelf to do, as ſoon
as I have, by an Improvement of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
I am to propoſe, made good my
late promiſe of confirming the ſecond
Paradox.</p>
               <p>And before I can well draw an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from theſe Experiments, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the propoſitions to be prov'd
by them,<note place="margin">In certain, Notes upon ſome of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics-mechanical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, touching the Aire.</note> I muſt brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repeat what I have
elſewhere deliver'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
(on another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion)
touching the cauſe of the ſinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98187:45"/>
of ſuch Bubbles. Namely that
the Bubble <hi>X.</hi> conſiſting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of Glaſs,<note place="margin">Fig. 3.</note> which is heavier
in <hi>ſpecie</hi> then Water; and
Aire, which is lighter in <hi>ſpecie</hi> then
Water; and, if you pleaſe, alſo of
Water itſelf, which is of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Gravity with Water; as long as
this whole aggregate of ſeveral Bodys
is lighter then an equal bulk of Water,
it will float; but in caſe it grows heavier
then ſo much water, it muſt, according
to the known Laws of the Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
neceſſarily ſinck, (being not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
ſupported.) Now when there
is any competent preſſure (whether
produc'd by weight or otherwiſe,) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the water, in which this Bubble is for
the moſt part immers'd, becauſe the
glaſs is a firm Body &amp; the water, though
a Liquor, either ſuffers no compreſſion,
or but an inconſiderable one; the Aire
included in the Bubble, being a ſpringy
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98187:46"/>
and very compreſſible Body, will
be compell'd to ſhrink, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
poſſeſſing leſs Room, then it did
before, the contiguous water will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in its place; which being a
body above a thouſand times heavier
then aire, the Bubble will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
become heavier then an equall
Bulk of water, and conſequently
will ſink: but if that force or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
be remov'd, the Impriſon'd Aire
will by its own Spring free it ſelf
from the intruding water; and the
Aggregate of Bodys, that makes up the
Bubble, being thereby grown lighter
then an equal bulk of water, the ſubſided
bubble will preſently emerge to the
Top.</p>
               <p>This Explication of the Cauſes of
the ſinking of Bubbles agrees, in ſome
things, with the Doctrine of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Jeſuites <hi>Kercher &amp; Shottus,</hi> and ſome
other writers, in the Acount they give
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98187:46"/>
of thoſe two Experiments that are
commonly known by the name, the
one of the Romane, the other of the
Florentine Experiments. But there are
alſo particulars wherein I (who have
never a recourſe to a <hi>fuoa Vacui,)</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from their Doctrine; the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
I go upon, having invited and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
me to make that Experiment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
me ſome new Phaenomena, which
agree not with their Opinions, but do
with mine: but I forbear to mention
them here, becauſe they belong to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Papers; and for the ſame reaſon I
omit ſome acceſſion of Ludicrous Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena
(as they call them,) which I
remember I have ſometimes added to
thoſe, which our Induſtrious Authors
have already deduc'd from thoſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being premis'd, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the confirmation of the ſecond
Paradox, by the following Experiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98187:47"/>
Take a long glaſs pipe, ſeal'd or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
exactly ſtop'd at one end and
open at the other (whoſe Orifice if it
be no wider, then that it may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
ſtop'd with mans. Thumb, the
Tube will be the fitter to exhibit ſome
other Phanomena. Into this pipe
pour ſuch a quantity of common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as that there may be a foot, or half
a yard, or ſome other competent part
left unfill'd, for the uſe to be by and by
mention'd. Then having poiz'd a glaſs
Bubble with a ſlender neck, in ſuch a
manner as that though it will keep at
the Top of the water, yet a very little
addition of weight, will ſuffice to ſinck
it, put this Bubble thus poiz'd into the
Tube; where it will ſwim in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the water, as long as it is
let alone, but if you gently pour oyle of
Turpentine upon it, (I ſay gently to
avoid confounding the Liquors) you
will perceive that, for a while, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98187:47"/>
Bubble will continue where it was: but
if you continue pouring on oyl, till it
have attain'd a ſufficient height above
the water, (which, 'twill be eaſie to
peceive, becauſe thoſe two liquors will
keep themſelves diſtinct) you ſhall
ſee the Bubble ſubſide till it fall to the
Bottom, and continue there as long as
the oyl remains at the height above
the water.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this Phanomenon,
according to our Doctrine, is this,
That the oyl of Turpentine, though a
lighter Liquor then water, yet gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
upon the ſubjacent water, and by its
preſſuce forces ſome of it into the cavity
of the bubble at the open Orifice of its
neck, whereby the Buble, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but very little leſs heavy then an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Bulk of water, being by this acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made a little more heavy must neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
ſinck; and the cauſe of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion,
namely the preſſure of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98187:48"/>
oyle, continuing, it muſt remain at
the bottom.</p>
               <p>And to confirm this explication I
ſhall add, that in caſe, by inclining the
Tube or otherwiſe, you remove the
Cylinder of oyl, or a competent part
of it, (in caſe it were longer then was
neceſſary,) the Bubble will again
emerge to the Top of the water (for,
as for the oyle, that is too light a Liquor
to buoy it up;) which happens only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the preſſure of the oyle upon the
water being taken of the Aire, by vertue
of its own ſpring, is able to recover its
former Expanſion, and reduce the
bubble to be as light as 'twas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>And now we may proceed to that
other Experiment, by which we late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
promis'd to confirm the firſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.
And in ſome regard this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Experiment has been preferr'd, as
more ſtrange, to that I have been reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98187:48"/>
For it ſeem'd much leſs impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that of two Heterogeneous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
the inferior ſhould be preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the incumbent, which, though
lighter, kept in an intire body above it;
then that in water, which is a Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous
Liquor; and whoſe parts min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
moſt freely and exquiſitely with one
another, the upper part ſhould preſs
upon the lower; and that they will do
ſo, may appear by the Experiment it is
now time to ſub joyn.</p>
               <p>Provide a long Tube and a poiz'd
Bubble, as in the former Experiment,
then having pour'd water into the
Tube, till it reach above 5 or 6 Inches
(for a determinate height is no way
neceſſary) above the Bottome, caſt
in the Bubble, which will not only
ſwim, but if you thruſt it down into
the water it will of it ſelf emerge to the
upper part of it. Wherefore take a
ſlender Wand, or a Wire, or a ſlender
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98187:49"/>
glaſs pipe, or any ſuch Body that is
long enough for your purpoſe, and with
it having thruſt the bubble beneath the
Surface of the water, pour water ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Tube (whoſe Cavity will
not be near fill'd by the rod or wire) till
it have attain'd a competent height,
(which, in my laſt Tryals, was about
a Foot, or half a Yard above the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:)
and you ſhall ſee, that the bubble,
which before endeavour'd to emerge,
will by the additional weight of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
water, be depreſs'd to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Tube. After which you
may ſafely remove the wire, or other
body that kept it from riſing. For as
the weight of the Incumbent water
was that which made it ſinck, ſo that
weight continuing on it, the bubble
will continue at the bottom.</p>
               <p>But yet it is not without cauſe, that
we imploy a wire, or ſome ſuch thing,
in this Experiment, though we affirm
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98187:49"/>
it to be onely the weight of the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
water, that makes the Bubble ſinck.
For if you ſhould pour water into the
Tube, to the height lately mention'd,
or ev'n to a greater, if you did not make
uſe of the Wire, it would not ſerve the
turn; becauſe that as faſt as you pour
in the water, the Bubble being left to
it ſelf, will riſe together with it; and
ſo, keeping always near the upper part
of the water, it will never ſuffer the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
to be ſo high above it, as it muſt
be, before it can depreſs it. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that 'tis the weight of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
water that ſincks the Bubble, and
keeps it at the Bottom; if you take out
of the Tube a competent quantity of
that Liquor, and ſo take of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of it from the Bubble, this will
preſently, without any other help, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to ſwim, and regain the upper part
of the water; whence it may at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
be praecipitated, by pouring back
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98187:50"/>
into the Tube the water that was taken
out of it. And theſe Confirmations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the former Proofs of the firſt and
ſecond Paradoxes, being we conceive
ſufficient to ſatisfie Impartial Readers
of the Truth of them, we ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
advance to the next Propoſition,
if we did not think fit to interpoſe here
a <hi>Scholium.</hi>

                  <p>IT may perchance be wondred at,
why, ſince we lately mention'd our
having made ſome Tryals with oyle of
Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> we did not in the
preſent Experiment, in ſtead of fair wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
make uſe of that, it being a very
much heavier Liquor, and (though it
may be incorporated with expreſs'd
oyles) unmingleable in ſuch Tryals with
oyle of Turpentine. But to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98187:50"/>
That ev'n in ſuch ſlender pipes, as
thoſe made uſe of about the firſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
I found that oyle of Tartar was
ponderous enough to flow down, though
ſlowly, into the oyle of Turpentine at
one ſide of the immers'd Orifice, whilſt
the oyle paſs'd upwards by it along the
other ſide of the pipe. And my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of this could not but make me
a little wonder, That ſo Curious a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as <hi>Monſieur Paſchall,</hi> ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
teach, That if a Tube of above
14 foot long, and having its Orifice pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
14 foot under water, be full of
Quickſilver, the fluid Metal will not
all run out at the Bottom of the pipe,
though the Top of it be left open to
the Aire, but will be ſtop'd at a foot
high in the pipe, For the Impetus,
that its fall will give it, muſt probably
make it flow quite out of the pipe: And,
not here to mention thoſe Tryals of
ours with Quickſilver and ſlender
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98187:51"/>
Tubes, that made me think this very
improbable; if we conſider that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
will not ſucceed with much
more favourable circumſtances, betwixt
oyle of Turpentine and oyle of Tartar,
though the heavier of theſe two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
be many times lighter that quick.
ſilver: It tempts me much to ſuſpect,
that <hi>Monſieur Paſchall</hi> never actually
made the Experiment, at leaſt with a
Tube as big as his Scheam would make
one gueſs, but yet thought he might
ſafely ſet it down, it being very conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to thoſe Principles, of whoſe
Truth he was fully perſwaded. And
indeed, were it not for the impetus, the
Quickſilver would acquire in falling
from ſuch a height, the Ratiocanation
were no way unworthy of him.</p>
                  <p>But Experiments that are but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatively
true, ſhould be propos'd as
ſuch, and may oftentimes fail in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe;
becauſe there may intervene di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98187:51"/>
other things capable of making

by the peculator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is wont to

particullar thing which he principally
conſiders; As in this caſe our Author
ſeems not to haue conſider'd, that in
ſuch Tubes, as the Torricelliah Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
is wont to be made in the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                  <p>And I have known Ingenious men,

downwards, then (ſuppoſing there be
no Accidental Impediment) the Body
will be buoy'd or lifted up. And though
the Body be heavier then ſo much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and conſequently will ſubſide, yet
that Endeavour upwards of the water,
that touches its lower part, is onely
rendred ineffectual to the raiſing or
ſupporting the body, but not deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the force of the heavy Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from time to time reſiſted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded
by the water, as much as it
would be if that Body were put into
One Scale, and the weight of as much
water, as is equal to it in bulk, were
put into the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:98187:53"/>
To confirm this, we may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to what we ſaid in the Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſecond Experiment.<note place="margin">Fig. 1. 2.</note>
For in caſe the ſlender pipe,
wherein the water is kept ſuſpended, be
thruſt deeper into the oyl or in caſe theſe
be more oyle pour'd into the Veſſel, the
water will be impell'd up higher into
the pipe; which it would not be, if
the oyle, though bulk for bulk a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Body, did not preſs againſt the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Surface of the vvater, (where, alone,
the two Liquors are contiguous,) more
forcibly then the water by its gravity
tends dovvnvvards. And even vvhen
the Liquors reſt in an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> the
oyle continually preſſes upvvards, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the lower Surface of the water;
ſince in that continual endeavour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards
conſiſts its conſtant reſiſtance
to the continual endeavour that the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the water gives it to deſcend.
And ſince the ſame Phaenomenon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98187:54"/>
whether we ſuſpend water in
oyle, as in the ſecond Experiment, on
oyle in water, as in the firſt: it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that the propoſition is as well
applicable to thoſe caſes, where the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein'd
Body is ſpecifically heavier, as
to thoſe where 'tis ſpecifically lighter
then the ſubjacent fluid.</p>
               <p>But a further and clearer proof of
this Doctrine will appear in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the next propoſition. In
the mean time, to confirm that part of
out Diſcourſe, where we mention'd the
Reſiſtance made by the water to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
that ſinck in it, Let us ſuppoſe,
in the annexed Figure, That
the pipe E F contains an oyle
ſpecifically heavier then water,<note place="margin">Fig. 4.</note>
(as are the oyls of Guaisteum, of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon,
or Cloves, and ſome others,)
and then, That the oyle in the pipe,
and the water without, being at reſt
in an <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> the pipe be ſlowly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98187:54"/>
rais'd towards the Top of the Veſſel.
'Tis evident, from our former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and from Experience too, that
there will run out drops of oyle, which
will fall from the bottom of the pipe,
to that of the Veſſel; but far more
ſlowly then if they fell out of the ſame
pipe in the Aire.</p>
               <p>Now to compute how much the
preſſure of the water againſt the lower
parts of the drop amounts too, let us
ſuppoſe the drop to be <hi>G,</hi> to whoſe
lowermoſt part there is contigueus, in
any aſſignable place where it falls, the
imaginary Superficies <hi>H J.</hi> 'Tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
That if the drop of oyle were
not there, its place would be ſupplied
by an equal bulk of water; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſame ſpecifick Gravity with
the reſt of the water in the Veſſel, the
Surface <hi>H J</hi> would be laden every
where alike; and conſequently to part
of it would be diſplac'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But now,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98187:55"/>
the drop of oyle being heavier then ſo
much water, that part of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſuperficies, on which that drop leans,
has more weight upon it, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
equal part of the ſame Superficies;
and conſequently, will give place to
the deſcending drop. And ſince the
caſe of every other ſuppos'd Surface,
at which the drop can be conceiv'd to
arrive in its deſcent, will be the ſame
with that of the Superficies <hi>H J;</hi> it
will for the Reaſon newly given, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
falling till it comes to the bottom
of the Veſſel which will ſuffer it to
fall no further. And in caſe the drop
<hi>G</hi> were not, as we ſuppoſe it, of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
heavier in <hi>ſpecie</hi> then water, but
juſt equal to it, the contiguous part of
the Superficies <hi>H J</hi> would be neither
more nor leſs charged then the other
parts of the ſame Supeficies; and the
part lean'd on would be neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
nor rais'd, but the drop <hi>G</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:98187:55"/>
would continue in the ſame place. And
ſo we may prove, (what is affirm'd by
<hi>Archimedes,</hi> and other Hydroſtatical
Writers) That a Body acquiponderant
<hi>in ſpecie</hi> to water, will reſt in any aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
place of the water where 'tis put.</p>
               <p>And (to proceed further) ſince, if
the drop <hi>G</hi> were of a matter but acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderant
to water it would not ſinck
lower at all, no more then emerge; it
follows, that though being heavier in
<hi>ſpecie</hi> then water, it will fall, yet the
gravity upon whoſe account it falls, is
no more then that by which it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
an equal bulk of water; (ſince,
if it were not for that over plus, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the water would hinder it
from falling at all:) and conſequently,
it looſes in the water juſt as much of
the weight it would have in the aire, as
ſo much water, weigh'd likewiſe in the
ſame aire, would amount to.</p>
               <p>Which is a Phyſicall Account of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98187:56"/>
that grand Theorem of the Hydroſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
which I do not remember that I
have ſeen made out in any Printed
Book, both ſolidly and clearly; The
Learned <hi>Stevinus</hi> himſelf, to whom the
later Writers are wont to refer, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
but an obſcure (and not Phyſical)
demonſtration of it.</p>
               <p>And, becauſe this Theorem is not
only very noble, but (as we elſe where
manifeſt) very uſeful, 'twill not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
to add, That it may eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
by Experiment.</p>
               <p>For if you take (for inſtance) a piece
of Lead, and hang it by a Horſe haire
(that being ſuppos'd very near acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderant
to water) from one of the
Scales of an exact Ballance; and,
when you have put a juſt Connterpoize
in the other Scale, ſuffer the Lead to
ſinck in a reſſel of water, till it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
covered with it, but hangs free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in it, the counterpoize will very
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98187:56"/>
much preponderance, And, part of the
Counterpoize being taken out till the
Ballatice be again reduc'd to an <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium,</hi>
you may eaſily (by ſubducting
what you have taken out, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it with the whole weight of the
Lead in the aire) find what part of its
weight it looſes in the water And then
if you weigh any other piece of the
ſame Lead, ſuppoſe a Lump of 12
<hi>ounces,</hi> and hang it by a Horſe haire at
one ſcale, you may be ſure that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the other ſcale a weight leſs
by a twelfth part, (ſuppoſing Lead to
water to be as twelve to one) that is
eleven <hi>ounces,</hi> though the weights be
farr from an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> in the Aire,
they will be reduc'd to it when the
Lead it cover'd with water.</p>
               <p>The preſſure of water againſt the
lower part of the Body immers'd in it
may be confirmed by adding; That
we may thence deduce the cauſe of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98187:57"/>
the emergency of wood and other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
lighter then water; which though
a familiar Effect, I have not found its
cauſe to have been ſo much as enquired
into by many, nor perhaps to have been
well rendred by any. If we ſuppoſe
then that the pipe be almoſt fill'd, not
with a ſincking but a ſwimming oyle, as
oyle of Turpentine, if, as in the firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
the lower orifice be thruſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water, (to a far leſs depth then that
of the oyle in the pipe) and the upper
be ſlovvly unſtop'd, the oyl vvill (as vve
formerly declar'd) get out in drops at
the bottom of the pipe. But to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
vvhy theſe drops, being quite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
and ſurrounded vvith vvater, and
preſs'd by it as vvell dovvnvvards as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards,
ſhould rather emerge then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
I ſhall not content my ſelf to ſay,
that vvater <hi>in ſpecie</hi> heavier then this
kind of oyle; For, beſides that in ſome
caſes (e're long to be mention'd) I have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98187:57"/>
made the water to depreſs ev'n this
kind off oyle, and beſides that 'tis not
every piece of wood lighter in <hi>ſpecie</hi>
then water that will float upon water,
how ſhallow ſoever it be: The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is how this praepollent Gravity of
the water comes to raiſe up the oyle,
though there be perchance much more
water, for it to break its way thorough,
above it, then beneath it.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon then of the emerſion of
Lighter Bodies in heavier fluids, ſeems
to be this, That the endeavour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the water, contiguous to the
lower part of the Body, is ſtronger then
the endeavour downwards of the ſame
Body, and the water incumbent on it.
As, in the former Scheme, ſuppoſing
the Drop <hi>G</hi> to be the oyle of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
and to touch the two imaginary
and parallel plains <hi>H J, K L;</hi> 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that upon the lower part of the
Drop, <hi>N,</hi> there is a greater preſſure of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98187:58"/>
water, then upon the upper part of the
ſame Drop, <hi>M:</hi> becauſe that upon all
the ſurface <hi>K L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> there is but an uniform
preſſure of water <hi>A K B L,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the parts of the ſurface <hi>H I,</hi>
there is a greater weight of water <hi>A H
B I,</hi> except at the part <hi>N;</hi> for there
the oyle G, being not ſo heavy as ſo
much water, the oyle being expos'd to
a greater preſſure from beneath, then its
own gravity (and that of the water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on it) will enable it to reſiſt,
muſt neceſſarily give way and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
upwards. And the caſe being
the ſame between that and any other
parallel plain, whereſoever we ſuppoſe
it to be in its aſcent, it muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be impell'd further and further
upwards till it arrive at the Top; and
there it will float upon the water: Or,
(to Explicate the matter without Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures)
when a ſpecifically lighter Body
is immers'd under water, it is preſs'd
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98187:58"/>
againſt by two pillars of water; the
one bearing againſt the upper, and the
other againſt the lower part; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the lengths of both theſe Pillars
muſt be computed from the Top of
the water, the lower part of the
immers'd body muſt be preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by a Pillar longer then the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part by the thickneſs of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
Body; and conſequently muſt
be preſs'd more upwards then down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
And by how much the greater
diſparity of ſpecifick Gravity there is
betwixt the water and the emerging
<hi>Body,</hi> by ſo much the ſwifter <hi>(caeteris
paribus)</hi> it will aſcend: becauſe ſo much
the more will there be of preſſure
upon all the other parts of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſurface, then upon that part that
happens to be contiguous to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the aſcending Body.</p>
               <p>And upon the ſame Grounds we may
give (what we have not yet met with)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98187:59"/>
a good ſolution of that Probleme, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by Hydroſtatical Writers, why,
if a Cylindrical ſtick be cut in two
parts, the one as long again as the other,
and both of them, having been detain'd
under water at the ſame depth, be let
go at the ſame time and permitted to
emerge, the greater will riſe faſter then
the leſſer. For ſuppoſe one of theſe
Bodies, as <hi>O P,</hi> to be two foot high, and
the other, <hi>Q R,</hi> to be half ſo much,
and that the lowermoſt Surfaces of
both be in the ſame imaginary plaine,
parallel to the uppermoſt ſurface of
the water and three foot diſtant from
it; in this caſe there will be againſt the
lower part of each of the wooden
Bodies a preſſure, (from the laterally
ſuperior water) equal to that upon all
the other parts of the Imaginary plain,
whereto thoſe Bodies are contiguous;
But whereas upon the upper ſurface of
the ſhorter Body, <hi>Q R,</hi> there will lean
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98187:59"/>
a pillar of water two foot high, the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of the ſame Liquor that will lean
upon the Top of the taller Body, <hi>P O,</hi>
will be but one foot high; as the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
conſiderer will eaſily perceive. So
that the wooden Bodys being lighter <hi>in
ſpecie</hi> then water, both of them will be
impell'd upwards; but that compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
pillar, (if I may ſo call it) which
conſiſts of one foot of wood and two
foot of water, will by its gravity more
reſiſt the being rais'd, then that which
conſiſts of two foot of wood and but
one foot of water: ſo that the cauſe of
the unequal celerity in the Aſcenſion of
theſe Bodys conſiſts chieflly, (for I
would neither overvalue nor exclude
Concomitant Cauſes) that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the preſſure againſt the upper
and lower part of each body reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is greater in one then in the other.</p>
               <p>And hence we may probably deduce
a reaſon of what we often obſerve in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98187:60"/>
Diſtillation of the oyles of Anniſſeeds,
Cloves, and diverſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aromatick vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
in Lembecks by the intervention
of water; for oftentimes, when the fire
has not been well regulated, there will
come over, beſides the floating Oyle,
a whitiſh water, which will not in a
long time become cleare. And as we
have elſwhere taught, That whiteneſs
to proceed from the numerous refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from the oyly ſubſtance of the
Concrete' by the heat of the fire bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
into innumerable little Globuls,
and diſpers'd through the Body of the
water; ſo the reaſon why this white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
continues ſo long, ſeems to be
<hi>chiefly</hi> (for I mention not ſuch things, as,
the great ſurfaces that theſe little Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buls
have in reſpect of their Bulk) that,
becauſe of the exceeding minuteneſs of
theſe Drops, the height of the water
that preſſes upon the upper part, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
equal to that of the water that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98187:60"/>
preſſes againſt the lower part; ſo that
the difference between theſe two preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
being inconſiderable, it has power
to raiſe the Drops but very ſlowly, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that upon this ground I devis'd
a Menſtruum, wherewith I could mingle
oyle in drops ſo exceedingly minute,
that, ev'n when there was but a few
ſpoonfuls of the mixture, it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
whitiſh for divers whole days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
though at length they will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge;
and the ſooner, becauſe whilſt
they ſwim up and down, as they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
chance to meet and run into
one another, they compoſe greater
Drops; which are (for the Reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given) leſs ſlowly impell'd up by
the water: at the Top of which, the
Chymiſt; after a due time, is wont to
find new oyl floating. But whether this
be any way applicable to the ſwimming
of the inſenſible particles of corroded
metals in <hi>Aquaflortis,</hi> and other ſaline.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98187:61"/>
Menſtruums, I muſt not now ſtay to
enquire.</p>
               <p>One thing more there is, that I would
point at before I diſmiſs this Paradox;
Namely, that, for the ſame Reaſon
we have all this while deduc'd, when
the emergent drop, or any other Body,
floats upon the Top of the water, it will
ſinck juſt ſo far, (&amp; no farther) till the
immers'd part of the float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Body be equal in Bulke
to as much water as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in weight to the whole Body.<note place="margin">Fig. 5.</note> For
ſuppoſe, in the annexed figure, <hi>Y</hi> to be
a Cube of wood three foot high and
ſix pound in weight; this wood, being
much heavier then Aire, will ſinck into
the water, till it come to an imaginary
ſuperficies, <hi>X W,</hi> where, having the
poſition newly deſcrib'd, it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
acquieſce. For all the other equal
parts of the Superficies, <hi>X, W, Q,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lean'd upon by pillars of water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98187:61"/>
in height to the part <hi>X A,</hi> or
<hi>W B,</hi> if the whole weight of the wooden
Cube be greater then that of as much
water as is equal to the immers'd part,
it muſt neceſſarily ſinck lower, becauſe
the ſubjacent part of the Surface (at
<hi>V,)</hi> will be more charg'd then any of the
Reſt. And, on the other ſide, if the
Cube were lighter then as much water
as that whoſe place the immers'd part
takes up; it muſt by the greater preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the water upon the other parts
of the imaginary ſuperficies <hi>X W,</hi> then
upon that contiguous to the wood, (as
at <hi>V)</hi> be impell'd upward, til the preſſure
of the whole wood upon the part it
leans on, be of the ſame degree with that
of the reſt of the water, upon the reſt of
the ſuperficies: and conſequently be the
ſame with the water, whoſe place the
immers'd part of it takes up. The
lightneſs of that immers'd part, in
reſpect of ſo much water, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98187:62"/>
by the weight of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>immers'd
part, which is extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Superficies of the water.
And we ſee, that when a piece of wood
fals into water, though, by the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
it acquires in falling, it paſſes
through divers imaginary plains that
lye beneath its due ſtation; yet the
greater preſſure, to which each of
thoſe plains is expos'd in all its other
parts, then in that which is contiguous
to the Bottom of the wood, dos quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impel it up again, till, after ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſions
and ſubſidings, it reſts at length
in ſuch a poſition, as the newly expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

ought to hold, not only in ſuch

exemplifie it in, (ſuch as a piece of

Bodyes, though of a concave figure, and
made up of many Bodys of never ſo
differing natures; (and perhaps ſome
of them joyn'd together only by their
ſuperincumbency upon one another)
and partly becauſe that a Truth, which
is one of the main and uſefulleſt of the

                  <p>After (then) having imploy'd ſeveral
Veſſels, ſome of wood, ſome of Laton,
and ſome of other materials, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
what I deſir'd; we found glaſſes
to be the moſt commodious we could
procure. And therefore filling a large
and deep glaſs to a convenient height
with fair water, we plac'd in it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deeper glaſs, ſhap'd like a <hi>Goblet</hi> or
Tumbler, that it might be the fitter for
ſwimming; and having furniſh'd it firſt
with Ballaſt, and then, for merryment
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98187:63"/>
ſake, with a wooden Deck, by which a
tall Maſs, with a Sayle fuſten'd to it,
was kept upright; we fraughted with
wood, and by degrees pour'd Sand into
it, till we had made it ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Then obſerving how high the water
reach'd in the larger Glaſs, (which by
reaſon of the Veſſels Tranſparency
was eaſie to be ſeen) we carefully
plac'd two or three markes in the
ſame level with the Horizontal Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the water; and taking out
the floating Veſſel, as it was, with
all that belong'd to it, and wiping the

into the large Glaſs above mentioned,
we found it to reach to the marks that
we had faſtened to the outſide of the

make it reſemble a Ship, had made it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe

Veſſel it ſelf, with all that was in it,
or ſupported by it, was equal in weight
to as much water as was equal in
bulk to that part of the Veſſel which
was under water, ſuppos'd to be cut off
from the extant part of the ſame veſſel
by a plain continuing the Horizontal
Surface of the water: ſince the weight
of the floating Veſſel, which rais'd up
the water in the larger Veſſel to the

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98187:64"/>
with the weight of the water, which
being pour'd into the larger veſſel (when
the other was taken out) rais'd the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therein to the ſame height. We
may alſo obtaine the ſame end, by a
ſomewhat differing way, (which is the
beſt way in caſe the Veſſels be too
great <hi>viz.</hi> to obſerve, firſt, by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in water out of a Bowle or Paile,
or other Veſſel of known capacity, as
often as is neceſſary to fill the great Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
or Ciſtern, or Pond, to the Top,
(or to any determinate height requir'd)
and, next, letting out, or otherwiſe
removing all that water, to put in its
place the Veſſel, whoſe weight is to be
found out. Thirdly, to let, or poure
in, water till the Veſſel be afloat, and
by its weight raiſe the External water
to the height it had before: And laſtly,
to examine how much this water, that
was laſt pour'd in, falls ſhort in weight
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98187:65"/>
of the water that was in it at firſt, and
afterwards remov'd. For this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
will give us the weight of as much
water, as is aequiponderate to the whole
floating Veſſel, whither ſmall or great,

               <p>THis Propoſition may be eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
deduc'd from the already
mention'd Experiments. But yet, for
further illuſtration and proof, vve vvill
add that vvhich follovvs.</p>
               <p>Take a ſlender Glaſs-pipe, (ſuch as
vvas us'd about the firſt Experiment)
and ſuck into it about the height of an
Inch of deeply tincted vvater; and, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſtopping the upper Orifice, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſe
the lovver part of the pipe into
a Glaſs half fill'd vvith ſuch tincted
vvater, till the Surface of the Liquor
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98187:66"/>
in the pipe be an inch (or as low as you
would have it) beneath that of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
water. Then pouring on oyle of
Turpentine till it ſwim 3 or 4 Inches, or
as high as you pleaſe above the vvater;
looſen gently your finger from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Orifice of the pipe, to give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed
Aire a little intercourſe vvith the
External, and you ſhall ſee the tincted
vvater in the pipe, to be impell'd up,
not only higher then the Surface of the
External vvater, but almoſt as high as
that of the External oyl, through vvhich
(it being tranſparent and colourleſs) the
Red Liquor may be eaſily diſcern'd.</p>
               <p>Novv in this caſe it cau't be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
That the aſcent of the water in the
pipe proceeds from Natures abhorren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> ſince the pipe being
full of aire, and its Orifice unſtopp'd,
though the vvater ſhould not aſcend, no
danger of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> vvould enſue; the
aire and the vvater remaining contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:98187:67"/>
The true Reaſon then of the aſcent
of the water, in our caſe, is but this,
That upon all the other parts of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
Superficies, that paſſes by
the immers'd Orifice of the pipe, there
is a preſſure partly of water, and partly
of the oyle ſwimming upon that water,
amounting to the preſſure of 4 or 5 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of water; whereas upon that part
of the ſame ſuperficies whereon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
contain'd in the pipe leans, there
is but the preſſure of one inch of water,
ſo that the parts near the immers'd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice
muſt neceſſarily be thruſt out of
place by the other parts of water that
are more preſs'd; till ſo much Liquor
be impell'd up into the pipe as makes
the preſſure on that part of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Superficies, as great as that of the
oyle and water on any other equal part
of it: and then, by Vertue of the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium,</hi>
(often mention'd) the water will
riſe no further; and, by vertue of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98187:67"/>
ſame <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> it will reſt a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
the Surface of the External oyle,
becauſe this laſt nam'd Liquor is leſſe
heavy, bulk for bulk, then water.</p>
               <p>And by this we may be aſſiſted to
give a reaſon of the Aſcenſion of water
in ordinary ſucking Pumps. For as the
oyle of Turpentine, though a lighter
Liquor then water, and not mingleable
with it, does, by leaning upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the External water, preſs up the
water within the pipe, to a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
height then that of the External wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it ſelf: ſo the Aire, which, though
a far lighter Liquor then oyle of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine,
reaches I know not how many
Miles high, leaning upon the Surface
of the water in a Well, would preſs it
up into the Cylindrical Cavity of the
Pump<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much higher then the External
water it ſelf reaches in the Well, if it
were not hinder'd.</p>
               <p>Now that which hinders it in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98187:68"/>
Pump, is either the Sucker, which
fences the water in the Pump from the
preſſure of the External aire, or that
preſſure it ſelf. And therefore, all
that the drawing up of the Sucker needs
to do, is, to free the water in the Pipe
from the impediment to its Aſcent,
which was given it by the Suckers lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on it, or the pillar of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaeres
being incumbent on it; as in our
Experiment, the ſides of the pipe do
ſufficiently protect the water in the
pipe from any preſſure of the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
oyle, that may oppoſe its aſcent.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, as the water in our
pipe was impell'd up ſo high, and no
higher, that the Cylinder of water in
the pipe was juſt able to ballance the
preſſure of the water and oyle without
the pipe; ſo in Pumps, the water does
riſe but to a certain height, as about
33 or 34 foot: and though you pump
never ſo long, it will be rais'd no
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98187:68"/>
higher; becauſe at that height the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the water in the Pump, upon
that part of the imaginary Superficies
that paſſes by the lower Orifice of it,
is the ſame with the preſſure which
other parts of that imaginary ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſuſtaine from as much of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
water, and of the Atmoſphaere,
as come to lean upon it.</p>
               <p>That there may be caſes wherein
water may be rais'd by ſuction, not
upon the Account of the weight of the
aire, but of its ſpring, I have elſewhere
ſhovvn; and having likevviſe in other
places; endeavour'd to explicate more
particularly the aſcenſion of vvater in
Pumps; vvhat has been ſaid already
may ſuffice to be ſaid in this place,
where 'tis ſufficient for me to have
ſhovvn, That vvhither or no the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion
of water <hi>may have</hi> other cauſes,
yet in the caſes propos'd, <hi>it needs</hi> no
more then the competent vveight of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98187:69"/>
an External Fluid, as is the Aire; vvhoſe
not being devoid of gravity, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
of our Experiments has brought
even our Adverſaries to grant us.</p>
               <p>For confirmation of this, I will here
add, becauſe it now comes into my
mind, (what might perhaps be elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
ſomewhat more properly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd)
an Experiment that I did but
lightly glance at in the Explication of
the firſt, and the <hi>Scholium</hi> of the ſecond
Paradox.</p>
               <p>In order to this I muſt advertiſe,
That, whereas I there took notice, that
ſome Ingenious men had complain'd,
that, contrary to the Experiment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by <hi>Monſieur Paſchall,</hi> they were
not at all able to keep <hi>Mercury</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in Tubes, however very ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
though the lower end were deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
immers'd in water, if both their
ends were open: The Reaſons of my
doubting, whether our Ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98187:69"/>
had ever made or ſeen the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
were, not only that it had been
unſuccesfully tryed, and ſeem'd to me
unlikely to ſucceed in Tubes more ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then his appear'd; but becauſe the
Impetus, which falling quick ſilver gains
by the acceleration of motion it acquires
in its deſcent, muſt in all probability
be great enough to make it all run out
at the bottom of a Tube, open at both
ends, and fill'd with ſo ponderous a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
though the Tube were very much
ſhorter then that propos'd by <hi>Monſieur
Paſchall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This advertiſement I premiſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
that, notwithſtanding the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs
of the Experiment, as it had been
propos'd and tried, I might have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
not to think it impoſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
by another way, the main thing
deſir'd; which was to keep Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuſpended in a Tube, open at both
ends, by the reſiſtance of the ſubjacent
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98187:70"/>
water. For by the Expedient I am
going to propoſe, I have been able to do
it, even with a Liquor much lighter
then water.</p>
               <p>Finding then, that even a very ſhort
Cylinder of ſo ponderous a fluid, as
<hi>Mercury,</hi> would, if it were once in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
deſcend with an impetus not eaſy
to be reſiſted by the ſubjacent Liquor,
I thought upon the following Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to prevent this inconvenience. I
took a ſlender pipe, the Diameter of
whoſe Cavity was little above the ſixth
part of an Inch, and having ſuck'd in
at the lower end of it ſomewhat leſſe
then half an inch of Quickſilver, and
nimbly ſtopp'd the upper Orifice with
my finger; I thruſt the Quickſilver
into, a deep glaſs of oyle of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
with a care not to unſtop the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Orifice, till the ſmall Cylinder of
quickſilver was 18 or 20 times its depth
beneath the Surface of the oyle. For
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98187:70"/>
by this means, when I unſtopp'd the
pipe, the Quickſilver needed not (as
otherwiſe it would) begin to fall, as
having a longer Cylinder then was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to make an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> with
the other fluid. For by our Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
the preſſure of the oyle was already
full as great, if not greater, againſt the
lower part of the Mercurial Cylinder,
as that which the weight of ſo ſhort a
Cylinder could exerciſe upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
and ſubjacent oyle. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
upon the removal of my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
the Quickſilver did not run out,
but remain ſuſpended in the lower part
of the pipe. And as; if I rais'd it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Superficies of the oyle, the
Mercury would drop out for want of
its wonted Counterpoize; ſo, if I thruſt
the pipe deeper into the oyle, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
preſſure of the oyle would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
impell up the Mercury to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the higher parts of the pipe,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98187:71"/>
which being again a little, and but a
little, raiſ'd, the Quickſilver would fall
down a little nearer the bottom of the
pipe: and ſo, with a not unpleaſant
ſpectacle, the ponderous Body of quick
ſilver was made ſometimes to riſe, and
ſometimes to fall; but ſtill to float up
on the Surface of a Liquor, lighter ther
common Spirit of Wine it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But, beſides that the Experiment,
if the maker of it be not very careful;
may eaſily enough miſcarry, the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
it gives ſeldome proves laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
the oyle of Turpentine after a
while inſinuating it ſelf betwixt the
ſides of the pipe, and thoſe of ſo ſhort
a Cylinder of Mercury, and thereby
diſordering all. And therefore, though
I here mention this Experiment, as I
tryed it in oyle of Turpentine; becauſe
that is the Liquor I make uſe of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
theſe Paradoxes; and becauſe alſo
I would ſhew that a lighter fluid then
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98187:71"/>
water, (and therefore why not aire, if
its height be greatly enough increas'd:)
may by its weight and preſſure, either
keep the Mercury ſuſpended in pipes,
or even raise it in them: Yet I found
water (wherewith I fill'd tall glaſſes)
a fitter Liquor then oyle for the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment;
in which though I ſought, and
found ſome other Phaenomena, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they more properly belong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
place, I ſhall leave them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
in this.</p>
               <p>And ſince Experience ſhews us, that
a Cylinder of, Mercury, of about 30
Inches high, is aequiponderant to a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of water of about 33 or 34 foot
high; its very eaſie to conclude, That
the weight of the External aire, which
is able to raiſe and keep ſuſpended 33 or
34 foot of water in a Pump, may do
the like to 29 or 30 Inches of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver
in the Torricellian Experiment.</p>

aſide all other Arguments, he contents
himſelf to confute his Adverſaries with
one Demonstration (as he calls it) groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the quite contrary of what we
here aſſert. For his Objection runs
to this ſence. That if it were the
preſſure of the External Aire, that
kept the Quickſilver ſuſpended in the
newly mention'd experiment, the height
would not (as Experience ſhews it is)
be the ſame in all Cylindrical pipes,
though of very differing B<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es. For,
ſuppoſing the height of the Mercurial
Cylinder, in a Tube of half an Inch
Diameter, to be 29 Inches; 'tis plain,
that a Mercurial Cylinder of the ſame
height, and three Inches in Diameter,
muſt weigh divers times as much as the
former; and therefore the preſſure
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98187:73"/>
of the External aire, being but one and
the ſame, if it be a juſt Counterpoize to
the greater Cylinder, it cannot be ſo to
the leſs; and if it be able to keep the
one ſuſpended at 29 Inches it muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to keep the other ſuſpended at a far
greater height, which yet is contrary to
experience. And indeed this Objection
is ſo ſpecious, That, though I elſewhere
have already anſwer'd it, both by reaſon
and Experience, as far forth as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
the Torricellian Experiment;
Yet, to ſhew the miſtake on which it is

both <hi>that</hi> the Aſſertion is true, and
<hi>why</hi> it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>Provide then a more then
ordinarily wide mouth'd
Glaſs,<note place="margin">Fig. 6.</note> cleer, and of a Convenient
depth; into which having put a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98187:73"/>
quantity of water, deeply
ting'd with Brazil or ſome other Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
fit to the Orifice a broad but
thin Cork, in which, by burning or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
make divers round holes of very
differing wideneſſes; into each of
which you may thruſt a glaſs Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
open at both ends, and of a ſize fit
for the hole that is to receive it; that
ſo the ſeveral pipes may be imbrac'd
by theſe ſeveral holes; And, as neare as
you can, make them parallel to one
another, and perpendicular to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the water, into which they
are to be immers'd. But we muſt not
forget, that, beſides theſe holes, there
is an aperture to be made in the ſame
Corke (it matters not much of what fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
or whereabouts) to receive the
ſlender end of a glaſs Funnel; by
which oyl may be convey'd into the
veſſel, when it is ſtopp'd with the Cork.
And in the ſlender part of this Funnel
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98187:74"/>
we uſe to put ſome Cotton-week, to
break the violence of the oyl that is to
be pour'd in, which might elſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
the Experiment. All this being
thus provided, and the Cork (furniſh'd
with its pipes) being fitted to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Veſſel; if at the Funnel you
pour in oyl of Turpentine, and place
the Glaſs betwixt your eye and the
Light; you may, through that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Liquor; perceive the Tincted
water, to be impell'd up into all
the pipes, and to riſe uniformly in
them. And, when this tincted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
has attain'd to the height of two
or three, or more Inches, above the
lowermoſt Surface of the External oyl;
if you remove the Funnel, (which yet
you need not do, unleſs there be yet
oyl in it,) you may plainly perceive the
water to reach as high, in one
of the ſmaller pipes, as in another three
or four times as great; and yet the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98187:74"/>
water in the ſeveral pipes (as 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent)
is ſuſtain'd, at that height above
the level of the other water, by the
preſſure or counterprize of the external
oyle; which then if one being lighter in
<hi>ſpecie</hi> then water, will have its Surface
ſomewhat higher without the pipes,
then that of the Tincted water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them. And if by the Aperture, that
receives the Funnel, you immerſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to the Bottom of the oyle, the
ſhorter leg of a ſlender glaſs Syphon,
at whoſe longer Leg you procure by
Suction the oyle to run out; you ſhall
perceive, That, according as the depth
and preſſure of the External third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes,
ſo the water in the pipe will
ſubſide; and that uniformely, as well
in the leſſer as in the greater pipes.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this is not difficult
to be render'd, by the Doctrine already
deliver'd. For ſuppoſe, E F to be
the Surface of the water, both within
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98187:75"/>
and without the pipes, before any oyle
was poured on it: if we then ſuppoſe
the oyle to be poured in through the
Funnel, its lightneſs in reſpect of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherewith it will not mingle, will
keep it from getting into the cavity of
the pipes <hi>L, M, N;</hi> and therefore
ſpreading it ſelf on the outſide of them
above, it muſt neceſſarily, by its gravity,
preſs down the Superficies of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
water, and impell up that liquor
into the cavities of the pipes. And if
we ſuppoſe the pouring on of the oyl to
be continued till the uppermoſt ſurface
of the oyl be raiſed to <hi>G H,</hi> and that of
the external water depreſs'd to <hi>I K,</hi>
(or thereabouts,) an imaginary plain

water, then any other part, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to that Circle of the ſame Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Superficies, is by the water or oyle
incumbent on it; (and conſequently,
no more then the part comprehended
within the circle of the finall pipe <hi>N,</hi>
is by the water contain'd in that ſmall
pipe;) the external oyle having as
much a greater height upon the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<hi>I K,</hi> then the water within the
pipe, as is requiſite to make the two
Liquors Counter-ballance each other,
notwithſtanding the difference of their
ſpecifick Gravities. And though the
pipe <hi>L</hi> were twice as bigg, it would
Charge the ſubjacent plain <hi>I K</hi> no
more then the preſſure of the oyle on
the other parts of the ſame imaginary
Surface is able to reſiſt. And yet this
preſſure of the External oyle ought not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98187:76"/>
to be able to raiſe the water in the
ſlender pipe <hi>N,</hi> higher then the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<hi>Q</hi> in the ſame Level with the
Surface <hi>O.</hi> For, if the water were
higher in the ſmall pipe; being a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
Liquor then oyle, it muſt preſs
upon that part of the Surface <hi>I K,</hi> it
leans on, with greater force then the
external oyle upon the other parts of
the ſame plain <hi>I K;</hi> and therefore with
greater force then the weight of the
External oyle could reſiſt. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
the water in the ſlender pipe
muſt ſubſide, till its Surface be inferiour
to that of the External oyle; ſince, till
then, the difference of their ſpecifick
gravities cannot permit them to reſt in
an <hi>Aequilibrium.</hi> To be ſhort; It is
all one, to the reſiſtance of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
oyl, how wide the Cylinder is
that it ſupports in the pipe; provided
the height of it be not greater in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the height of the oyl, then
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98187:76"/>
the difference of the reſpective Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
of thoſe two Liquors requires.
For, ſo long the preſſure of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of water-will be no greater, on
that part of the Imaginary Superficies
which it leans upon, then the preſſure
of the external oyle will be on all the
other parts of the ſame Superficies;
and conſequently, neither the one, nor
the other of thoſe Liquors will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
but they will both reſt in an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it will not he amiſs to note;
Firſt, that it is not neceſſary that the
Glaſs Cylinders <hi>L, M, N,</hi> ſhould be
all of the ſame length; ſince, the lower
Orifice being open, the water will riſe
to the ſame height within them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the parts immers'd under the
water be exactly of the ſame length or
no.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, That throughout all
this Diſcourſe, and particularly in the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98187:77"/>
Explication of this Paradox, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
either that the ſlendereſt pipes,
that are imploy'd about theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are of a moderate ſize, and not
exceeding ſmall; Or that, in caſe they
be very ſmall, allowance be made in
ſuch pipes for this property, That
water will riſe in them to a greater
height, then can be attributed to the
bare Counterpoize of either the water
or the oyle, that impels it upwards and
keeps it ſuſpended. But this difference
is of ſo little moment in our preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
That we may ſafely neglect
it, (as hereafter we mean to do) now
we have taken this notice of it for
prevention of miſtakes.</p>

by it may be confirm'd the firſt part of

may be alſo apply'd to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98187:79"/>
countenance the ſecond. But becauſe
this is one of the nobleſt and uſefulleſt
Subjects of the Hydroſtaticks, we
think it worth while to illuſtrate, after
our manner, each of the two parts of
our Paradox by a ſenſible Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, Take a ſlender Glaſs pipe,
of an even Bore, turn'd up at one end like
the annexed Syphon.<note place="margin">Fig. 8.</note> Into this
Syphon ſuck oyl of Turpentine
till the Liquor have fill'd the ſhorter
leg, and be rais'd 2 or 3 Inches in the longer.
Then nimbly ſtopping the upper
Orifice with your finger, thruſt the
lower part of the Syphon ſo farre into
a deep Glaſs full of water, That the
Surface of the oyle in the longer leg of
the pipe, may be but a little higher then
that of the External water; and, upon
the removal of your finger, you will
find the Surface of the oyle to vary but
little, or not at all, its former Station.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98187:80"/>
And as, if you then thruſt the pipe a
little deeper, you will ſoe the oyle in
the ſhorter leg to begin to be depreſs'd;
ſo, if afterwards you gently raiſe the
pipe toward the top of the water, you
ſhall ſee the oyle not only regain its
former ſtation, but flow out by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in drops that will emerge to the
Top of the water. Now, ſince the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was able, at firſt, to keep the oyl, in
the longer leg of the pipe, ſuſpended no
higher, then it would have been kept by
a Cylinder of water equal to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the ſhorter leg of the pipe, and
reaching directly thence to the Top of
the water; (as may be eaſily cried, by
making a Syphon, where the ſhorter
leg may be long enough to contain ſuch
a Cylinder of water to conterpoize the
oyl in the longer;) &amp; ſince, when once,
by the raiſing of the pipe, the height
of the incumbent water was leſſen'd,
the oyle did more then Counter-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98187:80"/>
it; (as appears by its flowing
out of the Syphon,) we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude;
That, though thence were in
the Veſſel a great deal of water, higher
then the immers'd Orifice of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,
(and it would be all one, though
the Syphon were placid at the ſame
depth in a pond or lake;) yet, of all
that water, no more did gravitate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Orifice, then that which was
plac'd directly over its, which was
ſuch a pillat of water, as the Paradox
deſcribes.</p>
               <p>And, by the way, we may hence
learn; That though water be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in pipes, yet it may preſs as
regularly upon a ſubjacent Body, as if
it were. And therefore we may well
enough conceive a pillar of water, in
the free water it ſelf, where there is
nothing on any ſide, but the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
water, to bound the imaginary
pillar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:98187:81"/>
But I had forgot to add, That the
firſt part of our Paradox will hold,
not only when the water, ſuperior to
the Body it preſſes upon, is free; but
alſo, when it is included in Veſſels of
never ſo (ſeemingly) diſadvantageous a
ſhape. For, if you ſo frame the ſhorter
leg of a Syphon, that it may expand its
ſelf into a funnel, like that of <hi>Fig.</hi> 6. em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
about the proof of the foregoing
(fiſth) Paradox; (for which purpoſe the
legs muſt be at a pretty diſtance from
each other:) though you fill that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
with water, the oyle in the longer
and ſlender leg of the Syphon will be
able to reſiſt the preſſure of all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
notwithſtanding the breadth of the
upper part of the funnel. So that, ev'n
in this caſe alſo, the Surface of the oyle
in the longer leg, will be but a little
higher then that of the water in the
funnel.</p>
               <p>For further Confirmation of this;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98187:81"/>
we caus'd to be made a Syphon, ſo
ſhap'd, that one of the legs (which
were parallel, and of the ſame Bore,)
had in the midſt of it a Sphaere of
Glaſs, ſave that it communicated with
the upper and lower parts of the ſame
leg.</p>
               <p>In the uniform leg of the Syphon,
we put a convenient quantity of oyle
of Turpentine, and into the other, as
much water as fill'd not only the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of it, but the Globular part too.
And yet we did not find, that all this
water was able to keep up the oyle in
the uniform leg, at a greater height
then if the leg that contain'd the water
had been uniform too; as much of the
water in the Globe, as was not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over the lower Orifice of it, being
ſupported by the lateral parts (if I may
ſo call them) of the ſame Globe. And,
if that leg were, inſtead of water, fill'd
with oyle, and the uniform leg with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98187:82"/>
water; notwithſtanding the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quantity of oyl, that was neceſſary
to fill that leg, whereof the hollow
ſphaere was but a part; the water in
the uniform leg would not be kept up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſo much as to the ſame height with the
oyle in the miſhapen leg.</p>
               <p>But to make this matter yet the
more clear, we caus'd a Syphon to be
made of the Figure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
in the adjoyning
Scheme;<note place="margin">Figur. 9.</note> into which having pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a convenient quantity of Mercury,
till it reach'd in the ſhorter leg <hi>C D,</hi>
almoſt to the bottom of the Clobulou
part <hi>E,</hi> and in the longer leg <hi>A B,</hi> to
an equal height: We afterwards,
poured a ſufficient quantity of water
into the ſaid longer leg <hi>A B,</hi> which
drove away the Quickſilver, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
it up in the ſhorter leg till it
had half, or more then half, fill'd the
Cavity of the Globular part <hi>E,</hi> (which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98187:82"/>
yet we did not wholly fill with Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,
becauſe the Tube <hi>A B</hi> was not
long enough for that purpoſe;) and
then we obſerv'd, that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great weight of (that Body,
which is of all Bodies, ſave one, the
moſt Ponderous) Quickſilver, which
was contain'd in the lower part of the
ſame leg of the Syphon, the ſurface of
the Quickſilver <hi>H G,</hi> was impell'd up
as high by the water in the Leg <hi>A B,</hi>
as the diſparity of the ſpecifick weights
of thoſe two Liquors (whereof one is
about 14 times as heavy as the other)
did require: So that it appear'd not,
that, for all the great weight of
Quickſilver, contain'd in the Globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Cavity <hi>E,</hi> there preſs'd any more
upon the ſlender and ſubjacent part
<hi>E C</hi> of that leg, then as much as was
plac'd directly over the lower Orifice
of the ſaid Cavity <hi>E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> So that the other,
and lateral parts of that Mercury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98187:83"/>
ſupported by the concave ſides of
the Glaſs, whereunto they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous,
the water in the leg <hi>A B,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
not any more preſs'd by the
quickſilver, then if the leg <hi>C D</hi> had
been, as well as the other, of an uniform
bigneſs; and, by this means, if we had
made the hollow Globe of a large Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter,
a ſmall quantity of water, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the leg <hi>A B,</hi> might have been
able to raiſe a quantity of quickſilver
exceedingly much heavier then it ſelf.
But then ſo little water can raiſe the
quickſilver, in ſo broad a pipe, but to an
inconſiderable height.</p>
               <p>To make out the ſecond part of our
Paradox by an Experiment, we took
three Glaſs-pipes; the one
made like a Bolt-head,<note place="margin">Fig. 10.</note> with
a round Ball and two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Stemms; the other was an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
pipe, blown with an Elbow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it made an Angle; and the third
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98187:83"/>
was as irregularly ſhap'd, as I could
get it blown; being in ſome places
much broader, and in ſome much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
then the lower Orifice of it.
And theſe two laſt nam'd pipes had
their upper ends ſo inſerted into holes,
made fit for them in a broad piece of
Cork; that, when they were immers'd,
they made not right Angles, but very
oblique ones, with the Horizontal Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Liquor. The other Glaſs
likewiſe, which conſiſted of a great
Bubble, and two oppoſite pipes, was
faſtened to the ſame Cork, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
before hand been made fit for a
wide mouth'd glaſs of a good depth,
and half fill'd with water, was thruſt
as a ſtopple into the mouth of the ſaid
glaſs, ſo that the water a ſcended a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
way into each of the three pipes by
their lower Orifices, which as well as
the upper we left open; Then a good
quantity of oyle of Turpentine being
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98187:84"/>
pour'd into the ſame Veſſel, through
a funnel, the water was by the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
oyle impell'd up to the height of
2 or 3 Inches in each of the three pipes.
Which argues, that, notwithſtanding
their being ſo unequal in bigneſs, and
ſo irregular in ſhape, (inſomuch that we
gueſs'd one of them was 10 or 12 times
greater in one part, then in another,
or then it was even at the Orifice) the
water, contain'd in each of them, preſs'd
upon its lower Orifice <hi>no more</hi> (I do
not add, nor no leſs) then it would have
done if it had been a Cylinder, having
the Orifice for its Baſis, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
depth of the water and oyle
above, for its height. For in caſe each
of the pipes had contein'd but ſuch a
Cylinder of water, that water would
nevertheleſs have had its uppermoſt
Superficies at the ſame height: and
on the other ſide, it would have been
impell'd up beyond it, if its weight did
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98187:84"/>
not as ſtrongly endeavour to depreſs
the immediately ſubjacent water, as the
preſſure of the External fluids endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to impel it up.</p>
               <p>And ſince the height of the water
was about the ſame in the ſeveral pipes,
though two of them, being very much
inclin'd, contain'd much more water
then if they were erected: yet by the
ſame way of reasoning we may gather,
That the imaginary plain, paſſing by
the immers'd Orifice of either of theſe
inclining pipes, ſuſtain'd no more of
preſſure, then it would have done from
a ſhorter Cylinder of water if erected.
And indeed, in all theſe caſes, where a
pipe either is broader in other places
then at its lower Orifice, or inclin'd any
way towards the Horizon, the weight
of the contain'd Liquor is not all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Liquor or the Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
to the lower Orifice, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the ſides of the pipe it ſelf. And
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98187:85"/>
therefore if, when in a ſlender pipe you
have brought a parcel of oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
to be in an <hi>Equilibrium</hi> with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
water, as in the Experiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the firſt Paradox; If, I ſay,
when this is done, you incline the pipe
towards the ſides of the Glaſs, You
may indeed obſerve the Surface of the
oyle in the pipe to be, as before, a little
higher then that of the water without it:
But you ſhall likewiſe ſee, That, though
the Orifice of the pipe were not thruſt
deeper into the water, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will be
a pretty deal of water got up into the
pipe; becauſe the oyle not leaning now
upon the water only; as it did before, but
partly upon the water, and partly upon
the pipe, its preſſure upon the ſubjacent
water is conſiderably leſſen'd; and there
by the external water, whoſe preſſure is
not diminiſh'd too, is able to impel up
the oyl, and intrude for a little way into
the pipe. But if you re-erect the pipe, the
preſſure of the oyle being then again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98187:85"/>
upon the ſubjacent water, it will
be able to depreſs, and drive it again out
of the Cavity of the pipe.</p>
               <p>And to this agrees very well what we
further try'd as follows: We cauſed 3
pipes to be blown (ſhap'd as the
adjoyning Figures;<note place="margin">Fig. 11.</note>) one having
in it divers acute Angles; the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a winding form, like a <hi>ſcrue</hi> or <hi>worm</hi>
of the Limbeck; and the third very ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly
crooked; and yet each of theſe
pipes having all its crooked parts, and
ſome of its ſtreight &amp; erected parts, fil'd
with oyl of Turpentine; being thruſt to
a convenient depth under water and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopp'd
there, (after the manner already
often declar'd) we found, that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our Paradox, the ſurface of the
oyle in the pipe was higher than that of
the water without it, as much as it
would have been in caſe the pipe had
been ſtreight, (as we try'd by placing
by the crookedeſt of them a ſtreight
pipe with oyle in it) though the quantity
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98187:86"/>
of the oyle, in one of theſe pipes, were
perhaps three times as much as would
have ſuffic'd, if the pipe had been ſtrait:
So that this ſurpluſage of oyle did not
preſs upon the ſubjacent water, (for if
it had done ſo, the oyle would have run
out of the pipe.) And I remember, that
lifting up as much of one of theſe crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
pipes, as I thought fit, ſomewhat
above the Surface of the water; when
the Superficies of the oyle in the pipe
was not above half an inch higher then
that of the water without it, I eſtimated
that the crooked pillar of oyl, contain'd
in that part of the <hi>pipe</hi> which was above
the Surface of the water, was about 7
or 8 Inches long. So true it is, that the
preſſure of Liquors, contain'd in pipes,
muſt be computed by the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
that meaſures their height, what
ever be their length or bigneſs.</p>

I choſe thus to expreſs this Theorem,
(which might be, according to <hi>Stevinus,</hi>
propos'd in more general terms,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this way of expreſſing it will beſt
ſuit with the ſubſequent Experiment,
and may conſequently facilitate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of the Paradox. But
though the Learned <hi>Stevinus</hi>'s aims
were to be commended; who finding
this Propoſition doubted, ſeems to
have had a great mind to give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
Demonſtration of it, and
therefore propoſes no leſs then five
pragmatical Examples (as he calls
them) to make out the truth of what
he aſſerts; yet in this he hath been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
unhappy, that that Experiment,
which alone (for ought I can find) has
been try'd of all the five, is rejected as
incompetent, by thoſe that profeſs to
have purpoſely made tryal of it. And
indeed, by reaſon of the difficulty of
bringing them to a practical examen,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98187:87"/>
I have ſomewhat doubted whether or
no this uſeful writer did ever make all
thoſe Tryals himſelf; rather then ſet
down the events, he ſuppos'd they muſt
needs have; as preſuming his conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
rightly deduc'd from a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative
Truth. Wherefore though an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of the Experiments, he propoſes,
be not free from difficulty, yet having,
by the help of an Expedient, made
it practicable, we are induc'd by its
plainneſs and clearneſs to prefer it to
what elſe he propoſes to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>We provided then a veſſel of Laton,
of the figure expreſſ'd in
the Scheme,<note place="margin">See Fig. 12.</note> and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it with a looſe Bottom
<hi>C D,</hi> made of a flat piece of wood co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with a ſoft Bladder and greas'd on
the lower ſide neer the edges, that lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the rim of wood <hi>G H,</hi> contiguous
every where to the inſide of the Laton
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98187:88"/>
it might be eaſily lifted from off this
Rim; and yet lye ſo cloſe, upon it, that
the water ſhould not be able to get out
between them: And to the midſt of this
looſe bottom was faſtned a long ſtring,
of a good ſtrength, for the uſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be declared. The Inſtrument
thus fitted, the water was poured in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace
at the Top <hi>A B,</hi> which, by its
weight preſſing the falſe Bottom <hi>C D</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſubjacent Rim, <hi>G H,</hi> contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to make the Veſſel the more tight,
and to hinder its own paſſing. The
Veſſel being fill'd with water we took
the forementioned ſtring, one of whoſe
ends was faſtned to <hi>I,</hi> the middle part
of the looſe Bottom; and, tying the
other end K to the extremity of the
Beam of a good pair of Scales, we put
weights one after another into the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
ſcale, till at length thoſe weights
lifted up the falſe Botom <hi>C D</hi> from
the Rim <hi>G H;</hi> and, conſequently,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98187:88"/>
lifted up the Incumbent water; which
preſently after ran down between them.
And having formerly, before we pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in any water, try'd what water
would ſuffice to raiſe the Bottom <hi>C D,</hi>
when there was nothing but its own
proper weight that was to be ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
we found, by deducting that
weight from the weight in the ſcale,
and comparing the Reſidue with the
weight of as much water, as the cavity
of the broad, but very ſhallow
Cylinder <hi>B E C H G D F</hi> would have
alone (if there had been no water in the
pipe <hi>A I)</hi> amounted to; we found, I
ſay, by comparing theſe particulars,
that the preſſure upon <hi>C D</hi> was by ſo
very great odds more, then could have
been attributed to the weight of ſo
little water, as the Inſtrument pipe and
all contain'd, in caſe the water had
been in an uniform Cylinder, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
a very ſhallow one, of a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98187:89"/>
as large as that of our Inſtrument,
That we could not but look upon the
ſucceſs, as that, which though it did
not anſwer what the reading of <hi>Stevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
might make a man expect; yet
may deſerve to be further proſecuted,
that whether or no the Paradox of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi>
(which not only ſome others,
but the Learned Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> himſelf
queſtion) wil hold; the Inquiry he has
ſtarted, may be ſo perſued, as to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſome improvement of this part of
Hydroſtaticks: where, to define
things with certainty, will perhaps be
found a difficulter Task then at firſt
glance one would think; both becauſe
divers ſpeculative things muſt be taken
into conſideration, whoſe Theory has
not perhaps yet been clear'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the difficulty that will be
found in practice by them that ſhall go
about to make <hi>Stevinus</hi>'s Experiments,
or others of that ſort with all requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98187:89"/>
Accurateneſs: As indeed, it is far
eaſier to propoſe Experiments, which
would in likelyhood prove what we
intend, in caſe they could be made,

               <p>Take then a ſlender Glaſs pipe
(like that imployd about the
firſt Experiment;)<note place="margin">Fig. 13.</note> and cauſe
it to be bent within two or three Inches
of one end, ſo that the longer and the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98187:90"/>
ſhorter legs, <hi>E F</hi> and <hi>F G,</hi> may make, as
near as can be, a right Angle at <hi>F;</hi> then
dipping the Orifice of the ſhorter leg
<hi>F G</hi> in oyle of Turpentine, ſuck into
the Syphon (if I may ſo call it) as
much of the Liquor, as will fill the
ſhorter leg, and reach two or three
Inches high in the longer; then, nimbly
ſtopping the upper Orifice with your
finger, immerſe the lower part of the
Glaſs under water, in ſuch manner as
that the longer leg <hi>E F</hi> may make, as to
ſenſe, right Angles with <hi>(A B)</hi> the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
Surface of the water, and the
ſhorter leg <hi>F G</hi> may be ſo far depreſs'd
under that Surface, That <hi>I K,</hi> the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the oyle in the longer leg,
be but a little higher then <hi>A B,</hi> that of
the external water. Then, removing
your finger, you may obſerve, That
the oyle in the Syphon will continue
(with little or no change) in its former
ſtation. By which it appears that there
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98187:91"/>
is a lateral preſſure of the water againſt
the oyle contiguous to <hi>G,</hi> the Orifice of
the ſhorter leg of the pipe, ſince it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that preſſure that hinders the efflux
of the oyl at that Orifice, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the preſſure of the perpendicular
Cylinder of oyle that would drive it
out.</p>
               <p>And that this preſſure of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
Cylinder doth really urge
the oyle in the ſhorter leg to flow out;
you may learn by ſlowly lifting the
Syphon (without changing its, former
poſture) towards the Surface of the
water. For as the lower leg comes
nearer and nearer to that Surface, (to
which, as I newly intimated, it is ſtill
to be kept parallel) the oyle in the
Horizontal leg will be driven out in
drops, by the preſſure of the other oyle
in the perpendicular leg.</p>
               <p>That likewiſe before you begin to
raiſe the Syphon, the lateral preſſure
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98187:91"/>
of the water againſt the lower Orifice
of it is, at leaſt in ſuch Experiments,
near about the ſame with what would
be the perpendicular preſſure of a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of water, reaching from the ſame
Orifice <hi>G</hi> (or ſome part of it) to the
top of the water, may be gather'd from
hence, That the Surface of the oyle in
the longer leg will be a litle higher then
that of the external water, as (by reaſon
of the often mention'd comparative levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the oyl) it would be, if we ſuppoſe,
That a pipe of Glaſs of the ſame bore,
and reaching to the top of the water,
being fitted to the Orifice of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal
Leg (as in the annex'd figure the
Cylinder, <hi>G H)</hi> were fill'd with water.</p>
               <p>And, to make out the latter part of
our propoſition, we need add no more,
then that, if you plunge the Syphon
deeper into the water, you ſhall find
the oyle, by the Lateral preſſure
of the water, driven by degrees
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98187:92"/>
quite out of the ſhorter leg into the
longer: and if you thruſt it yet dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
you may obſerve that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
leg will admit a Cylinder of water,
upon which that of oyle will ſwim;
the whole oyle alone being unable to
counterballance the lateral preſſure of
the water at ſo great a depth.</p>
               <p>By which laſt circumſtance, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that water has alſo a lateral
preſſure againſt water it ſelf, and that
increas'd according to its depth; ſince
otherwiſe the external water could not
impel that in the Horizontal leg of the
Syphon, into the perpendicular leg,
though to doe ſo, it muſt ſurmount the
weight or reſiſtance of the whole cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of oyl, that muſt be hereby violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rais'd in the ſaid perpendicular leg.</p>
               <p>But if you gently raiſe the Syphon
again, the lateral preſſure of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
againſt the immers'd Orifice being
diminiſh'd, (according as the diſtance
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98187:92"/>
of that Orifice <hi>G</hi> from the Horizontal
Surface, <hi>A B,</hi> comes to be leſſen'd,)
the prevalent oyle will drive out the
water, firſt out of the Longer leg, and
then out of the ſhorter, and will at
length flow out in drops at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
Orifice, and thence emerge to
the Top of the water.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when the oyle in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon
does juſt counterballance the
external water, if you keep the ſhorter
leg parallel to the Surface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and move the Orifice of it this way
or that way, and place it nearer or
further off from the middle or from
the ſides of the Glaſs, (provided you
keep it always at the ſame depth under
the water,) you'l find the oyl in the
longer Leg to continue (as to ſenſe) at
the ſame height: Whence we may learn
(what I have not yet found mention'd
by any Writer,) That, ev'n in the
mid'ſt of the water, we may ſuppoſe a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98187:93"/>
pillar of <hi>water,</hi> of a Baſis equal to the ſide
of an immers'd Body, (and reaching to
the loweſt part of it;) And that, though
this Imaginary aqueous pillar, ſuch as in
our figure <hi>G H,</hi> be not included in any
ſolid Body or ſtable ſuperficies; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
its lower parts will have a lateral
preſſure tending outwards, againſt the
imaginary ſides, from the weight of
the water that is above theſe ſubjacent
and lateral parts; and will have that
preſſure increas'd proportionably to the
height to which the imaginary pillar
reaches above them. Which obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being duely noted and apply'd,
may be of no mean uſe in the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of divers Hydroſtatical phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena.</p>
               <p>And laſtly if, in ſtead of holding <hi>E F,</hi>
the longer leg of our Syphon, perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular,
(and, conſequently, the ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
parallel to the Horizon,) you va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly

an Experiment, which though it
do not ſhew what the preciſe quantity

afford ſome hints that may
render it not unacceptable; I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
it, as I ſet it down not long after I
devis'd it.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place then, there was
made a glaſs Bubble with a ſlender
neck; and (in a word) of the figure
expreſs'd in the annex'd
Scheme;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fig.</hi> 14.</note> This Bubble I
caus'd to be ſo poys'd,
That, though it would float upon the
water, yet the addition of a weight
ſmall enough would ſuffice to make it
ſinck.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98187:94"/>
This done, I provided a very large
wide mouth'd Glaſs, and caus'd to be
fitted to it, as exactly as I could, a
ſtopple of Cork, which being ſtrongly
thruſt in, would not eaſily be liſted up.
In the middle of this Cork there was
burn'd, with a heated inſtrument, a
round hole; through which was thruſt
a long ſlender pipe of Glaſs; ſo that the
lower end of it was a pretty way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Cork, and the upper part
of it was, as near as could be, at right
Angles with the upper part of the ſaid
Cork. And in an other part of the
ſtopple, near the edge, there was made
another round hole, into which was
likewiſe thruſt another ſmall pipe;
whoſe lower part reach'd alſo a pretty
way beneath the Cork; but its upper
part was but about two or three Inches
high; and the Orifice of this upper
part was carefully clos'd with a ſtopple
and Cement. Then the glaſs veſſel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98187:95"/>
fill'd with water, and the pois'd
Bubble being made to float upon it, the
ſtopple or cover of the great glaſs veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
was put on, and made faſt with a
cloſe Cement, that nothing might get
in or out of the veſſel, but at the long
ſlender pipe; which was faſtned into
the Cork<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as was alſo the ſhorter
pipe) not only by its own fitneſs to
the hole, it paſs'd through, but by a
ſufficient Quantity of the ſame
Cement, carefully apply'd to ſtop all
creveſſes.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtrument thus prepar'd, (and
inclin'd this or that way, till the float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bubble was at a good diſtance from
that end of the long pipe, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
a pretty way downwards beneath
the Surface of the water,) we began to
pour in ſome of that Liquor at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Orifice of the pipe <hi>E F;</hi> and, the
mouth of the Veſſel being exactly
ſtopp'd, the water for want of another
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98187:95"/>
place to receive it, aſcended into the
pipe through which it had fallen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
And, if I held my hand when
the water I had pour'd in was able to
reach but to a ſmall height in the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
as for inſtance, to the Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<hi>J;</hi> the Bubble <hi>X</hi> would yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
floating. But if I continued pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
till the water in the pipe had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to a conſiderable height above the
Surface of that in the Veſſel, as if it
reach'd to K; then the Bubble <hi>X</hi> would
preſently ſinck to the bottome of the
Veſſel; and there continue, as long as
as the water continued at ſo great a
height in the pipe <hi>E. F.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Experiment will not only teach
us, That the upper parts of the water
gravitate upon thoſe that are under
them, but (which is the thing we are
now to confirm) That in a Veſſel, that
is full, all the lower parts are preſs'd
by the upper, though theſe lower be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98187:96"/>
not directly beneath the upper, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of them, and perhaps at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Line in which they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
preſs: Theſe things, I ſay, may
be made out by our Experiment. For
the Addition of the Cylinder of water
<hi>K J,</hi> in the pipe <hi>E F,</hi> makes the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>X</hi> ſubſide; as the force or preſſure
of any other heavy body upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the veſſel would do. And ſince
(as may be gather'd from the Reaſon
formerly given (in the Proof of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Paradox) of the ſincking of pois'd
Bubbles) the included aire in our Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was notably compreſs'd; it will
follow, that the Cylinder of water, <hi>KI,</hi>
did preſs the ſubjacent water in the
Veſſel. For, without ſo doing, it could
not be able to compreſs the aire in the
Bubble. And ſince the ſaid Bubble
did not ſwimme directly under or near
the pipe <hi>E F;</hi> but at one ſide of it, and
at a pretty diſtance from it, nay and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98187:96"/>
floated above the lower Orifice, <hi>F,</hi> of
the pipe; 'tis evident that that Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cylinder, <hi>JK,</hi> does not only preſs
upon the water, or other Bodies that
are directly under it; but upon thoſe
alſo that are laterally ſituated in reſpect
of it, provided they be inferior to it.</p>
                  <p>And, according to this Doctrine, we
may conceive, that every aſſignable part
of the ſides of the Veſſel does ſuſtaine
a preſſure, encreas'd by the encreaſe of
that parts depth under water, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the largneſs of the ſaid part.
And therefore, if any part were ſo weak,
as that it would be eaſily beaten out or
broken by a weight equal to the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>I K,</hi> (making always a due abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the obliquity of the preſſure)
it would not be fit to be a part of our
Veſſel: Nay the Cork it ſelf, though
it be above the Surface of the water in
the Veſſel; yet becauſe the water in
the pipe is higher then it, each of its
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98187:97"/>
parts reſiſts a conſiderable preſſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to its particular bigneſs, and
to the height of the water in the pipe.
And therefore, if the Cork be not well
ſtopp'd in, it may be lifted up by the
preſſure of the water in the pipe, if that
be fill'd to a good height. And if the
Cement be not good and cloſe, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will (not without noiſe) make it ſelf
a paſſage through it. And if the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>G,</hi> of the ſhorter pipe <hi>G H,</hi> (which
is plac'd there likewiſe to illuſtrate the
preſent conjecture) do not firmly cloſe
the Orifice of it, it may be forced out,
not without violence and noiſe. And,
for further ſatisfaction, if, in ſtead of the
ſtopple <hi>G,</hi> you cloſe the Orifice with
your finger, you ſhall find it preſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as ſtrongly, as it would be preſs'd
downwards by the weight of a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of water of the breadth of the pipe,
and of a not inconſiderable height, (for
'tis not eaſie to determine preciſely,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98187:97"/>
what height:) ſo that (to be ſhort) in
the fluid Body, we made our tryal with,
the preſſure of the Superior parts was
communicated, not onely to thoſe that
were plac'd <hi>directly</hi> under them, but
ev'n to thoſe that were but <hi>obliquely</hi> ſo,
and at a diſtance from them.</p>
                  <p>I had forgot to confirm, that it was
the preſſure of the ſuperiour parts of
the water, that made our floating bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſinck, by ſuch another circumſtance
as I took notice of in ſome of the former
Experiments; <hi>viz.</hi> that, when it lay
quietly at the bottom of the Veſſel, if
by inclining the Inſtrument we pour'd
off as much of the water in the pipe,
<hi>E F,</hi> as ſuffic'd competently to diminiſh
its height above the water in the Veſſel
<hi>A B C D,</hi> the air in the bubble, finding
its former preſſure alleviated, would
preſently expand it ſelf, and make the
bubble emerge. And to ſhow, That
the very oblique preſſure w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98187:98"/>
ſuſtain'd from the water in the pipe,
was not overmuch differing from that
which it would have ſuſtain'd from an
External force, or from the weight of
water plac'd directly over it; I caus'd
two ſuch bubbles to be pois'd, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
put each of them into a long Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical
Glaſs, open above, and fill'd
with water, upon which it floated, if we
thruſt it down a little way it would (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably
to what hath been
above related) aſcend again;<note place="margin">See the Proof of the 11. Paradox.</note>
ſo that we were forc'd to thruſt it down
to a good depth, before the preſſure of
the incumbent water was great enough
to make it ſubſide.</p>
                  <p>And perhaps it will not be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent

               <head type="sub">That water may be made as well to depreſs

               <p>HOw ſtrange ſoever this may ſeem,
to thoſe that are prepoſſeſs'd with
the vulgar Notions about gravity and
levity: It need not be marvail'd at, by
them that have conſider'd what has
been already deliver'd. For ſince, in
Fluid Bodies, the upper parts preſs
upon the lower, and upon other bodies
that lie beneath them. And ſince,
when a Body is unequally preſs'd
by others, whether lighter or heavier
then it ſelf, it muſt neceſſarily be thruſt
out of that place, where it is more
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98187:99"/>
preſs'd, to that where 'tis leſs preſs'd;
If that a parcel of oyle be by a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
ſo expoſed to the water, as that
the water preſſes againſt its upper Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies,
and not againſt the undermoſt

that there is nothing (whoſe preſſure is
not inferiour to that of the water) to
hinder its deſcent, (ſuppoſing, withal,
that the oyle and water cannot paſs by
one another; for which cauſe, we make

give way downwards, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
be depreſs'd and not buoy'd
up. This is eaſily exemplified by the
following Experiment.</p>
               <p>Take a ſlender Glaſs Syphon <hi>E F
G H,</hi> of the bore we have often
mention'd,<note place="margin">Fig. 15.</note> whoſe ſhorter leg
<hi>G H</hi> may be about 3 or 4 Inches long,

in oyle of Turpentine, till the oyle

quite fill the ſhorter leg, and reach to
an equal height in the longer, as from <hi>F</hi>

longer leg with your finger, and immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the repleniſh'd part of the Syphon
about an inch under water, you ſhall
perceive that as you thruſt it lower and
lower, upon the removal of your finger,
the oyle in the ſhorter leg will be made
to ſinck about an inch or ſomewhat
more; and as afterwards you thruſt
the pipe deeper, the oyle in the ſhorter
leg will, by the weight of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent

more and more, till it come to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

by continuing the immerſion, you may
impel it into the longer. The cauſe

make it needleſs to add any thing here
about it.</p>
               <p>It remains, that, before I proceed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98187:100"/>
to the next propoſition, I add; That,
to Exemplifie at once three Paradoxes,
(both this, and the next fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going,<note place="margin">Fig. 16.</note>
and the ſecond) I caus'd
to be made a ſlender Glaſs-pipe, of
the Figure expreſs'd in the annexed

Orifice <hi>L,</hi> ſuck'd into it as much oyle
of Turpentine, as reach'd in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt

the Orifice <hi>L,)</hi> I firſt ſtopp'd the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

And then, thruſting it as before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water to a convenient depth, upon
the removal of my finger, the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

that was in <hi>L M,</hi> that part of the

that is from <hi>M</hi> to <hi>N:</hi> And laſtly,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98187:101"/>
it impell'd it all up into the longer

ſubjoyne, That 'twas eaſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for me to collect from hence,
that, the Reaſon why it ſeems not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
That a parcel of oyle lighter then

from emerging to the Top of it, being
this, <hi>That ſince the Surface of a Veſſel
full of ſtanding water is (Phyſically ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)

the lower part of the immers'd Body,

the matter that the water that leans

againſt the lower, (and the Bodies not

the oyle might be kept ſuſpended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

               <p>To reduce this to practiſe, I took
the following courſe; having ſuck'd
into a ſlender pipe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſuch as that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
about the firſt experiment about
an Inch of water, and kept it ſuſpended
there by ſtopping the Orifice of the
pipe; I thruſt the lower part of the
pipe about two inches beneath the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of ſome oyl of Turpentitie (which,
to make the effect the clearer, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
tinge deeply with Copper:) then
removing my finger, the oyle being
preſs'd againſt the immers'd Orifice
with a greater force, then the weight
of ſo little ſuſpended water could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
that oyle was impell'd into the
lower part of the pipe to the height of
near an inch; and then again I ſtopp'd
the upper Orifice of the pipe with my
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98187:103"/>
finger, and thereby keeping both the
Liquors ſuſpended in it, I thruſt the
pipe into a Glaſs full of water, three
or four inches beneath the Surface of
it; and then (for the Reaſon juſt now
given) the water, upon the Removal
of my finger, will preſs in at the lower
Orifice of the pipe, and impell up the
oyle,<note place="margin">Fig. 17.</note> till they come to ſuch a

any thing in it. But as for the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he propounds to juſtifie his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination,
I fear his Readers will
ſcarce be much invited to attempt it.
For, beſides that it requires a great
quantity of Quickſilver; and a new
kind of Syphon, 15 or 20 foot long;
the Veſſels of Quickſilver muſt be
plac'd 6 or 7 yards under water, that
is, at ſo great a depth, that I doubt
whether men, that are not divers, will
be able conveniently to obſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
of the Tryal.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we will ſubſtitute a way,
which may be try'd in a glaſs Tube, not
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98187:105"/>
two foot deep, by the help of another
peculiarly contriv'd glaſs, to be prepar'd
by a skilful hand. Provide then a glaſs
Tube <hi>A B C D,</hi> of a good wideneſs,
and half a yard or more in depth; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
alſo a Syphon of two legs <hi>F K,</hi>
and <hi>K G,</hi> whereunto is joyn'd (at the
upper part of the Syphon) a pipe <hi>E K,</hi>
in ſuch manner, as that the Cavity of
the pipe communicates with
the cavities of the ſyphon;<note place="margin">Fig. 18.</note> ſo
that if you ſhould pour in
water at <hi>E,</hi> it would run out at <hi>F</hi> and
<hi>G.</hi> To each of the two Legs of this
new Syphon, muſt be ty'd with a ſtring
a pipe of Glaſs, <hi>I</hi> and <hi>H,</hi> ſeal'd at one
end, and open at the other; at which it
admits a good part of the leg of the
Syphon to which it is faſtned, and
which leg muſt reach a pretty way
beneath the Surface of the water,
wherewith the ſaid pipe is to be almoſt
fill'd. But as one of theſe legs is longer
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98187:105"/>
then the other, ſo the ſurface of the
water in the ſuſpended pipe <hi>I,</hi> that is
faſtned to the ſhorter leg <hi>K F,</hi> muſt be
higher (that is, nearer to <hi>K</hi> or <hi>A B</hi>)
then the ſurface of the water in the
pipe <hi>H,</hi> ſuſpended from the longer leg
<hi>KG;</hi> that (according to what is uſual in
Syphons) the water may run from a
higher veſſel to a lower.</p>
               <p>All things being thus provided; and
the pipe <hi>E K</hi> being held, or otherwiſe
made faſt that it may not be mov'd;
you muſt gently poure oyle of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine
into the Tube <hi>A B C D,</hi>
(which, if you have not much oyle,
you may before hand fill with water
till the liquor reach near the Bottom
of the ſuſpended pipes, as to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies
<hi>X Y)</hi> till it reach higher then the

the mean time cloſe with your finger
or otherwiſe, and afterwards unſtop)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98187:106"/>
and then the oyle preſſing upon the
water will make it aſcend into the legs
of the Syphon; and paſs through it,
out of the uppermoſt veſſel <hi>J,</hi> into the
lowermoſt <hi>H;</hi> and if the veſſel <hi>J</hi> were
ſupply'd with water, the courſe of the
water through the Syphon would
continue longer, then here (by reaſon
of the paucity of water) it can do.</p>
               <p>Now in this Experiment we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſee the water made to take its
courſe through the legs of a Syphon
from a higher veſſel into a lower, and
yet the top of the Syphon being perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
at <hi>K,</hi> the aire has free acceſs to
each of the legs of it, through the
hollow pipe <hi>E K</hi> which communicates
with them both. So that, in our caſe,
(where there is no danger of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi>
though the water ſhould not run <hi>through</hi>
the Syphon) the fear of a <hi>Vacuum</hi> cannot
with any ſhew of Reaſon be pretended
to be the cauſe of its running. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98187:106"/>
we muſt ſeek out ſome other.</p>
               <p>And it will not be very difficult to
find, that 'tis partly the preſſure of the
oyle, and partly the contrivance and
ſituation of the veſſels; if we will but
conſider the matter ſomewhat more
atentively. For the oyle, that reaches
much higher then <hi>K,</hi> and conſequently
then the leggs of the Syphon, preſſes
upon the ſurface of the External water,
in each of the ſuſpended pipes <hi>I</hi> and <hi>H.</hi>
I ſay the <hi>External water,</hi> becauſe the
oyle floating upon the water, and the
Orifice of both the legs <hi>F</hi> and <hi>G</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immers'd under the water, the oyle
has no acceſs to the cavity of either of
thoſe legs. Wherefore, ſince the oyle
gravitates upon the water without the
legs, and not upon that within them,
and ſince its height above the water is
great enough to preſs up the water
into the Cavity of the legs of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,
and impel it as high as <hi>K,</hi> the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98187:107"/>
water muſt by that preſſure be made to
aſcend.</p>
               <p>And this raiſing of the water hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
at firſt in both legs, (for the
cauſe is in both the ſame) there will be
a kind of conflict about <hi>K</hi> betwixt the
two aſcending portions of water,
and therefore we will now examine
which muſt prevaile.</p>
               <p>And if we conſider, That the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſuſtein'd by the two parcels of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the ſuſpended pipes <hi>I</hi> and <hi>H,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the height of the oyle that
preſſes upon them reſpectively; it
may ſeem (at the firſt view) That
the water ſhould be driven out of the
lower veſſel into the higher. For if we
ſuppoſe that part of the ſhorter leg
that is unimmers'd under water to be 6
Inches long, &amp; the unimmers'd part of
the longer leg to be ſeaven Inches; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſurface of the water in the
veſſel <hi>I,</hi> is an Inch higher, then that of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98187:107"/>
the water in the veſſel <hi>H,</hi> it will follow,
That there is a greater preſſure upon
the water, whereinto the longer leg is
dip'd, by the weight of an Inch of oyle:
ſo that that liquor being an inch higher
upon the ſurface of the water in the
pipe <hi>H,</hi> then upon that in the pipe <hi>I,</hi>
it ſeems that the water ought rather to
be impell'd from <hi>H</hi> towards <hi>K,</hi> then
from <hi>I</hi> towards <hi>K.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then we muſt conſider, That,
though the deſcent of the water in the
leg <hi>G,</hi> be more reſiſted then that in
the other leg, by as much preſſure as
the weight of <hi>an Inch of oyle</hi> can amount
to; Yet being longer by an Inch then
the water in the leg <hi>F,</hi> it tends down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
more ſtrongly by the weight of an
<hi>Inch of water,</hi> by which length it exceeds
the water in the oppoſite leg. So that
an inch of water being <hi>(ceteris paribus)</hi>
heavier then an Inch of oyle; the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the longer leg, notwithſtanding
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98187:108"/>
the greater reſiſtance of the external
oyle, has a ſtronger endeavour down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
then has the water in the ſhorter
leg; though the deſcent of this be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but by a depth of oyl leſs by an Inch.
So that all things computed, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be made towards that way
where the endeavour is moſt forcible;
and conſequently the courſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
muſt be from the upper veſſel, and
the ſhorter leg, into the longer leg, and
ſo into the lower veſſel.</p>
               <p>The application of this to what
happens in Syphons is obvious enough.
For, when once the water is brought
to run through a Syphon, the aire
(which is a fluid and has ſome gravity,
and has no acceſs into the cavity of the
Syphon,) muſt neceſſarily gravitate
upon the water whereinto the legs of
the Syphon are dip'd, and not upon
that which is within the Syphon: and
conſequently, though the incumbent
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98187:108"/>
aire have ſomewhat a greater height
upon the water in the lower veſſel, then
upon that in the upper; yet the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
it thereby exerciſes upon the
former more then upon the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very inconſiderable, the water in
the longer leg much preponderating
(by reaſon of its length) the water in
the ſhorter leg, the efflux muſt be out
of that leg, and not out of the other.
And the preſſure of the External aire
being able to raiſe water (as we find by
ſucking Pumps) to a far greater height,
then that of the ſhorter leg of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon;
the efflux will continue, for the
ſame reaſon, till the exhauſtion of the
water, or ſome other circumſtance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the caſe. But, if the legs of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon
ſhould exceed 34 or 35 foot of
perpendicular altitude; the water
would not flow through it;<note place="margin">In the Phyſico-Mechanical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</note>
the preſſure of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
aire being unable, (as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98187:109"/>
has been elſewhere declared,) to
raiſe water to ſuch a height. And
if a hole being made at the top of a
Syphon, that hole ſhould be unſtopp'd
while the water is running, the courſe
of it would preſently ceaſe. For, in
that caſe, the aire would gravitate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the water, as well within as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the cavity of the Syphon; and ſo
the water in each leg would, by its own
weight, fall back into the veſſel belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it.</p>
               <p>But becauſe this laſt circumſtance,
though clearly deducible from Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical
principles and Experiments,
has not, that I know of, been verified
by particular Tryals, I caus'd two
Syphons to be made, the one of Tin,
the other of Glaſs; each of which had,
at the upper part of the flexure, a
ſmall round hole or ſocket, which I
could ſtop and unſtop, at pleaſure,
with the pulp of my finger. So that,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98187:109"/>
when the water was running through
the Syphon, in caſe I remov'd my
finger, the water would preſently fall,
partly into one of the ſubjacent veſſels,
and partly into the other. And if the
legs of the Syphon were ſo unequal
in length, that the water in the one
had a far greater height (or depth) then
in the other; there ſeem'd to be, when
the liquor began to take its courſe
through the Syphon, ſome light preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
from the external aire upon the
finger, wherewith I ſtopp'd the Orifice
of the ſocket made at the flexure.</p>
               <p>And on this occaſion I will add,
what I more then once try'd; to ſhew,
at how very minute a paſſage the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the External aire may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
to Bodyes fitted to receive
it. For, having for this purpoſe ſtopp'd
the orifice of one of the above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Syphons, (inſteed of doing it with
my finger,) with a piece of oyl'd paper,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98187:110"/>
carefully faſtned with Cement to the
ſides of the ſocket; I found, as I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that though hereby the Syphon
was ſo well clos'd, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ran freely through: yet, if I made
a hole with the point of a needle, the
aire would at ſo very little an orifice
inſinuate it ſelf into the cavity of the
Syphon, and, thereby gravitating as
well within as without, make the
water in the legs to fall down into the
veſſels. And <hi>though,</hi> if I held the point
of the needle in the hole I made, and
then caus'd one to ſuck at the
longer leg; this ſmall ſtopple, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other help from my hand,
ſuffic'd to make the Syphon fit for uſe:
<hi>Yet</hi> if I remov'd the needle, the aire
would (not without ſome noiſe) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
get in at the hole, and put a
final ſtop to the courſe of the water.
Nor was I able to take out the needle
and put it in again ſo nimbly, but that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98187:110"/>
the aire found time to get into the
Syphon; and, till the hole were again
ſtopp'd, render it uſeleſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the water was by
ſuction endeavour'd to be ſet a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

               <head>PARADOX XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">That a ſolid Body, as ponderous as any
yet known, though near the Top of the
water it will ſinck by its own weight;
yet if it be plac'd at a greater depth then
that of twenty times its own thickneſs,
it will not ſinck, if its deſcent be not
aſſiſted by the weight of the incumbent
water.</head>
               <p>THis Paradox, having never been
(that I know of) propos'd as yet
by any, has ſeem'd ſo little credible
to thoſe to whom I have mention'd it,
(without excepting Mathematicians
themſelves,) that I can ſcarce hope it
ſhould be readily and generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this Illuſtrious Company, upon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98187:111"/>
leſs clear Teſtimony, then that of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
And therefore, though (if I
miſtake not) ſome part of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
may be plauſibly deduc'd by the
help of an Inſtrument ingeniouſly
thought upon by <hi>Monſieur Paſchal;</hi>
Yet I ſhall have recourſe to my own
Method for the making of it out, for
theſe two Reaſons. The one, That
a great part of the Paradox muſt be
Explicated, as well as prov'd, by the
Doctrine already ſetled in this paper.
The other, That the Experiment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by <hi>Monſieur Paſchal,</hi> being to be
done in a deep River, and requiring a
Tube 20 foot long, whoſe Bottome
muſt be fitted with a Braſs Cylinder,
made with an exactneſs, ſcarce (if at
all) to be hoped for from our Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
If I ſhould build any thing on this
ſo difficult an Experiment, (which
himſelf does not affirm to have ever
been actually tryed,) I fear moſt men
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98187:112"/>
would rather reject the Experiment
as a Chimaerical thing, then receive for
its ſake a Doctrine that appears to
them very Extravagant.</p>
               <p>Let us then, to imploy in this caſe
alſo the method we have hitherto made
uſe of, Fill a Glaſs veſſel, <hi>A B C D,</hi>
almoſt full of water;<note place="margin">Fig. 19.</note> only, in
regard that there is a great
depth of water requiſite to ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of the Experiment, This
laſt muſt not be ſo ſhallow as thoſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
imploy'd: but a deep Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or Tube ſeal'd at one end, whoſe
depth muſt be at leaſt two or three
foot, though its breadth need not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
2 or 3 Inches; and, to keep it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
it may be plac'd in a ſocket of
metal or wood, of a ſize and weight
convenient for ſuch a purpoſe. This
Glaſs being thus fitted in water, let
us ſuppoſe <hi>E F,</hi> to be a round and flat
piece of ſolid Braſs, having about an
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98187:112"/>
Inch in Diameter, and a fourth or ſixth
part of an inch in thickneſs. This Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
being immers'd under water till
it be juſt cover'd by the uppermoſt
Surface of that Liquor, and being let
go, muſt neceſſarily fall downwards in
it; becauſe if we ſuppoſe the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Superficies, <hi>G H,</hi> to paſs along the
Circle <hi>F,</hi> which is the lower part of
the Braſs Body, that metal being <hi>in
ſpecie</hi> far heavier then water, the Braſs
that leans upon the part <hi>F,</hi> muſt far
more gravitate upon the ſaid part <hi>F,</hi>
then the incumbent water does upon
any other part of the Superficies <hi>G H;</hi>
and, conſequently, the ſubjacent water
at <hi>F</hi> will be thruſt out of place by the
deſcending Body. And becauſe that,
in what part ſoever of the water, not
exceeding nine times its thickneſs mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
from the Top of the water <hi>A C,</hi>
the ponderous Body, <hi>E F,</hi> ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to be; there will be ſtill, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98187:113"/>
of the ſpecifick gravity of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
a greater preſſure upon that part
of the imaginary Superficies that
paſſes along the bottome of the Body
on which the part <hi>F</hi> ſhall happen to
lean, then upon any other part of the
ſame imaginary Superficies; the Braſs
Body would ſtill deſcend by vertue of
its own weight, though it were not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by the weight of the water that
is over it. But let us ſuppoſe it to
be plac'd under water on the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
plain <hi>J K;</hi> and let this plain, which
(as all other imaginary plains) is,
as well as the real Surface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to be conceiv'd parallel to the
Horizon; and let the depth or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of this plaine, from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt
Surface of the water, be
(ſome what) above nine times the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Braſs Body: I ſay that, in
this caſe, the body would not deſcend,
if it were not preſs'd downwards by
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98187:113"/>
the weight of the water it has over it.
For Braſs being but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
nine times<note n="*" place="margin">The word, <hi>about,</hi> is added, becauſe indeed the Author, as he elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where delivers, did by exact ſcales find Braſs to weigh between eight or nine times as much as water; but judg'd it needleſs to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Argument, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the fraction.</note> as
heavy as water of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
bulk to it, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>E F</hi> alone would
preſs upon the part <hi>F,</hi>
but as much as a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of water would,
which having an equal Baſis were 8 or
9 times as high as the Braſs is thick.
But now all the other parts of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
ſurfaces, <hi>I K,</hi> being preſs'd
upon by the incumbent water, which
is as high above them as the newly
mention'd Cylinder of water would
be; there is no reaſon why the part <hi>F</hi>
ſhould be depreſs'd, rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the Superficies <hi>J K:</hi> But
becauſe it is true, which we formerly
taught; namely, that water retains its
gravity in water; and that too, though
a body, heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then it, be plac'd
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98187:114"/>
immediately under it; it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
happen, That in what part ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the ſolid body be plac'd, provided
it be every way environ'd with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it muſt, for the Reaſon newly
given, be made to move downwards,
partly by its own weight, and partly
by that of the incumbent water; and
muſt continue to ſinck, till it come to
the bottom, or ſome other body that
hinders its farther deſcent.</p>
               <p>But in caſe the water above the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
body did not gravitate upon it, and
thereby aſſiſt its deſcent; or, in caſe
that the incumbent water were by ſome
Artifice or other, ſo remov'd, That
none of the lateral water (if I may ſo
call it) could ſucceed in its place to
lean upon the ſolid; then it will follow,
from what we have newly ſhown, that
the ſolid would be kept ſuſpended.
And in caſe it were plac'd much deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the water, as over againſt the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98187:114"/>
point <hi>L</hi> or <hi>M;</hi> Then, if we conceive
the incumbent water to be remov'd or
fenc'd off from it, the preſſure of the
ſolid alone upon the part <hi>F,</hi> of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Superficies <hi>L M,</hi> being very
much inferior to that of the water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the other parts of the ſame Surface,
the part <hi>F</hi> would be ſtrongly impell'd
upwards, by a force proportionate to
the difference of thoſe two preſſures.
And therefore, ſince I have found by
tryals, purpoſely made in ſcales mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly
exact, and with refined Gold,
(purer then perhaps any that was ever
weighed in water) That Gold, though
much the ponderoufeſt of bodies yet
known in the world, is not full 20 times
as heavy as water of the ſame Bulk;
I kept within compaſs (as well as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
a round number, as they call it)
when I ſaid, That no body (yet known,)
how ponderous ſoever, will ſubſide in
water by its own weight alone, if it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98187:115"/>
were ſo plac'd under water, that the
depth of the water did above twenty
times exceed the height of the Body;
(not to mention here, that though gold
and water being weigh'd in the aire,
their proportion is above 19 to one,
yet in the water, gold does, as other
ſincking bodies, looſe as much of its
weight, as that of an equal bulk of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
amounts too.)</p>
               <p>I was ſaying juſt now, that in caſe
the Brazen body were plac'd low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough
beneath the Surface of the
water, and kept from being depreſs'd
by any incumbent water, it would be
ſupported by the ſubjacent water. And
this is that very thing that I am now
to ſhew by an Experiment.</p>
               <p>Let then the Braſs body <hi>E F,</hi> be
the cover of a braſs Valve;<note place="margin">Fig. 20.</note>
(as in the annexed figure:)
and let the Valve be faſtned
with ſome ſtrong and cloſe Cement
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98187:115"/>
to a Glaſs pipe, <hi>O P,</hi> (open at both
ends) and of a competent length and
wideneſs. For then the Body, <hi>E F,</hi>
being the undermoſt part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
and not ſticking to any other
part of it, will fall by its own weight
if it be not ſupported. Now then, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thred to a Button <hi>Q,</hi> (that is
wont to be made in the middle of the
doors of Braſs valves) you muſt, by
pulling that ſtring ſtreight and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
make the Body, <hi>E F,</hi> ſhut the
orifice of the Valve, as cloſe as you can;
(which is eaſily and preſently done.)
Then thruſting the Valve under water,
to the depth of a foot or more; the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the ſides of the Glaſs, <hi>O P,</hi>
(which reaches far above the top of
the water <hi>X Y)</hi> will keep the water
from coming to beare upon the upper
part of the body <hi>E F;</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the imaginary Surface, <hi>V W,</hi> (that
paſſes by the lower part of the ſaid
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98187:116"/>
body) will, where it is contiguous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
be preſs'd upon only by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
weight of the body <hi>E F;</hi> but in
its other parts, by the much greater
weight of the incumbent water. So
that, though you let go the ſtring, (that
held the body, <hi>E F,</hi> cloſe to the reſt
of the Inſtrument) the ſaid body will
not at all ſinck, though there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but water beneath it to ſupport
it.</p>
               <p>And to manifeſt that 'tis onely the
preſſure of the water, of a competent
depth, that keeps the ſolid ſuſpended;
if you ſlowly lift up the inſtrument to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>(X Y)</hi> the top of the water;
you ſhall find, that, though for a while
the parts of the Valve will continue u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited,
as they were before; yet, when
once it is rais'd ſo near the Surface, (as
between the plain <hi>J K,</hi> and <hi>X Y)</hi> that
the ſingle weight of <hi>E F,</hi> upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
part of the imaginary plain that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98187:116"/>
paſſes by it, is greater then the preſſure
of the incumbent water upon other
parts of the ſame plain; that Body,
being no more ſupported as formerly,
will fall down, and the water will get
into the pipe, and aſcend therein, to
the level of the External water.</p>
               <p>But if, when the Valve is firſt thruſt
under water, and before you let go the
thred that keeps its parts together, you
thruſt it down to a good depth, as to
the Superficies <hi>R S:</hi> then, though you
ſhould hang a conſiderable weight, as
<hi>L,</hi> to the Valve <hi>E F,</hi> (as I am going to
ſhew you a Tryal with a Maſſy Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
of ſtone broader then the Valve,
and of divers inches in length) the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage
of preſſure on the other parts
of the plain, <hi>V W,</hi> (now in <hi>R S)</hi> over
and above what the weight of the body
<hi>E F,</hi> and that of the Cylindrical ſtone,
<hi>L,</hi> to boot, can amount to, on that
part of the Surface vvhich is contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98187:117"/>
to the ſaid body <hi>E F,</hi> will be great
enough to preſs ſo hard againſt the
lower part of the Valve, that its own
weight, though aſſiſted with that of
the ſtone, will not be able to diſjoyne
them.</p>
               <p>By which (to note that by the way)
you may ſee, that though, when two
flat and poliſh'd marbles are joyn'd
together, we find it is impoſſible to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them without force; we need not
have recourſe to a <hi>fuga vacui,</hi> to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
the cauſe of their Cohaeſion,
whilſt they are environ'd by the Aire,
which is a Fluid not devoid of Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and reaching above the Marbles no
body knows how high.</p>
               <p>And to evince, That 'tis only ſuch
a preſſure of the water, as I have been
declaring, that cauſes the Cohaeſion of
the parts of the Valve; if you gently
lift it up towards the top of the water,
you will quickly find the Braſs body,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98187:117"/>
                  <hi>E F,</hi> drawn down by the ſtone <hi>(L)</hi> that
hangs at it; as you will perceive by the
waters getting in between the parts of
the Valve, and aſcending into the pipe.</p>
               <p>To which I ſhall only add, what
you will quickly ſee, That, in perfect
Conformity to our Doctrine, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the body, <hi>E F,</hi> upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
water, being very much increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the weight of the ſtone that
hangs at it, the Valve needs not, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
be lifted up above the plain <hi>J K,</hi>
to overcome the reſiſtance of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
being now enabled to do it before
it is rais'd near ſo high.</p>

propos'd by a late Learned Writer,
to evince, that the upper parts of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preſs not upon the lower.</head>
               <p>AFter I had, this Morning, made
an end of reviewing the foregoing
papers, there came into my hands ſome
queſtions lately publiſh'd, among other
things, by a very recent Writer of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtaticks.
In one of which Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
the Learned Author ſtrongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
the contrary to what has there
been in ſome places prov'd, and divers
places ſuppos'd.</p>
               <p>The Author of theſe Erotemata
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98187:118"/>
aſſerts, That, <hi>in conſiſtent water, the
upper parts do not gravitate or preſs upon
the lower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, I think it will be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uſeleſs, nor improper, briefly to
examine here the Arguments he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces.
Not uſeleſs; becauſe the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he aſſerts, both is, and has long
been, very generally receiv'd; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
too, it is of ſo great importance,
that many of the Erroneous Tenets
and Concluſions, of thoſe that (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
profeſſedly or incidentally) treat
of Hydroſtatical matters, are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. And not <hi>improper;</hi> becauſe our
Learned Author ſeems to have done
his Reader the favour to ſumme up
into one page all the Arguments for
his Opinions that are diſperſedly
to be found in his own or others mens
Books. So that in anſwering theſe,
we may hope to do much towards a
ſatisfactory Deciſion of ſo important
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98187:119"/>
a Controverſie. And, after what we
have already deliver'd, our Anſwers
will be ſo ſeaſonable, that they will
not need to be long: The things they
are built on having been already made
out, in the reſpective places whereto the
Reader is referr'd.</p>
               <p>Our Author then maintains,
that, in Conſiſtent water, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
do not actually preſs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
parts, by the ſeven following
Arguments.</p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>Sayes he,</hi> Becauſe elſe
the inferiour parts of the water would be
more denſe then the Superior, ſince they
would be compreſs'd and condens'd by the
weight of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But if the Corpuſcles, whereof
water conſiſts, be ſuppos'd to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſolid &amp; hard; the inferior Corpuſcles
may be preſs'd upon by the weight of
the ſuperior, without being compreſs'd
or condens'd by them. As it would
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98187:119"/>
happen, if Diamond duſt were lay'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in a tall heap: For though the
upper parts, being heavy and ſolid Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles,
cannot be deny'd to lean
and preſs upon the lower; yet theſe,
by reaſon of their Adamantine hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
would not be thereby compreſs'd.
And 'tis poſſible too, that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
of water, though not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
hard, but that they may a little
yield to an extream force, be ſolid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
not to admit from ſuch a
weight, as that of the incumbent water,
(at leaſt in ſuch ſmall heights as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
are wont to be made in,) any
compreſſion, great enough to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
As, beſides ſome Tryals I have
formerly mention'd in another place,
thoſe made in the preſence of this
Illuſtrious Company ſeem ſufficiently
to argue; <hi>viz.</hi> That water is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
compreſſible by an ordinary
force. And I find not, by thoſe that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98187:120"/>
make the Objection, that they ever
took pains to try, whether in deep
places of the Sea, the lower parts are
not more condens'd then the upper:
nor do I ſee any abſurdity, that would
follow from admitting them to be
ſo.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>Our Authors ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is,</hi> Becauſe Divers feel not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water, the weight of the water that lyes
upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But for Anſwer to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I ſhall content my ſelf to make
a reference to the enſuing Appendix,
where this matter will be conſidered
at large; and where; I hope, it will be
made to appear, that the phaenomenon
may proceed, partly from the firm
Texture of the Divers body, and partly
from the nature of that preſſure which
is exercis'd againſt bodyes immers'd in
fluids; which, in that caſe, (as to ſenſe)
preſſes every where equally, againſt all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98187:120"/>
the parts of the body, expos'd to their
Action.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>The third Argument is,</hi>
That ev'n the ſlighteſt Herbs growing at the
bottom of the water, and ſhooting up in it
to a good height, are not oppreſs'd or lay'd
by the incumbent water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But the Anſwer to that is eaſie,
out of the foregoing Doctrine. For the
Plants, we ſpeak of, ſuſtain not the
preſſure of the water above them by
their own ſtrength; but by the help
of the preſſure of water that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath:
which being it ſelf preſs'd by the
water that is (though not perpendicular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
over it) ſuperior to it, preſſes them
upwards ſo forcibly, that if they were
not by their Roots, or otherwiſe
faſtned to the ground, they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>in ſpecie</hi> lighter then water,
would be buoy'd up to the top of the
water, and made to float; as we often
ſee that weeds do, which ſtorms, or
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98187:121"/>
other accidents have torn from their
native ſoyle.</p>
               <p>Object. 4. <hi>A fourth Objection is
this,</hi> That a heavy Body ty'd to a ſtring,
and let down under water, is ſupported,
and drawn out with as much eaſe, as it
would be if it had no water incumbent on it;
nay, with greater eaſe, becauſe heavy
bodyes weigh leſs in water then out
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But an Account of this is eaſie
to be rendred out of our Doctrine; For,
though the water incumbent on the
heavy body do really endeavour to
make it ſinck lower, yet that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
is rendred ineffectual, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
by the equal preſſure of the water
upon all the other parts of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ſurface, that is contiguous to the
bottom of the immers'd body. And
that preſſure upon the other parts of
that ſuppos'd plain, being equal not
only to the preſſure of the pillar of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98187:121"/>
but to that pillar, and to the
weight of as much water as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
body fills the place of; it muſt
needs follow, That not only the hand
that ſuſteins the body, ſhould not feel
the weight of the incumbent water,
but ſhould be able to lift up the Body
more eaſily in the water, then in the
aire. But though the preſſure of the
water incumbent on the ſtone can not,
for the reaſon aſſign'd, be felt in the caſe
propos'd; yet if you remove that water,
(as in the Experiment brought for the
proof of the laſt Paradox,) it will
quickly appear by the preſſure againſt
the lower part of the heavy body,
and its inability to deſcend by its own
weight, when it is any thing deep under
water; it will (I ſay) quickly appear,
by what will follow upon the abſence
of the Incumbent water, how great a
preſſure it exercis'd upon the ſtone
whilſt it lean'd on it.</p>

Object. 5. <hi>The fifth Argument is
propos'd in theſe words,</hi> Becauſe a
Bucket full of water, is lighter in the
water, then out of it; nor does weigh more
when full within the water, then when
empty out of it; nay it weighs leſs, for
the reaſon newly aſſign'd <hi>(in the fourth
Objection;)</hi> therefore the water of the
Bucket, becauſe it is within water, does
not gravitate, nor conſequently preſs down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
either the Bucket, or the water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Bucket. <hi>This is the grand and
obvious Experiment, upon which the
Schools, and the generality of Writers,
have very confidently built this Axiom:</hi>
That the Elements do not gravitate in their
proper place; <hi>and particularly, that
water weighs not (as they ſpeak) in its
own Element.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What they mean by proper
or <hi>natural place,</hi> I ſhall not ſtand to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
nor to enquire whether they
can prove, that water or any other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98187:122"/>
body poſſeſſes any place, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account, that the cauſe of gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or ſome other movent, enables it to
expel other contiguous Bodies (that are
leſs heavie or leſs moved,) out of the
place they poſſeſs'd before; and gives
it an inceſſant tendencie, or endeavour
towards the lowermoſt parts of the
Earth.</p>
               <p>But as to the Example propos'd, its
very eaſie to give an account of it.
For ſuppoſe <hi>ABCD,</hi> to be a Well;
wherein, by the ſtring <hi>E F,</hi> the Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
is ſuſpended under water, and has
its Bottom contiguous to the imaginary
plain <hi>I K.</hi> If now we ſuppoſe the Bucket
to conſiſt only of wood, lighter then
water, it will not only not preſs upon
the hand that holds the Rope at <hi>E,</hi> but
will be buoyd up, till the upper parts of
the Bucket be above the top of the
water; becauſe the wood, whereof the
Bucket is made, being lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:98187:123"/>
then water, the preſſure of the water
in the Bucket <hi>G,</hi> and the reſt of the
water incumbent on that, together
with the weight of the Bucket it ſelf,
muſt neceſſarily be unable to preſs the
part <hi>H</hi> ſo ſtrongly, as the other parts
of the imaginary plaine <hi>I K</hi> are preſs'd
by the weight of the meer water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on them. But if, as tis uſual,
the Bucket conſiſts partly of wood,
partly of iron; the Aggregate may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
indeed be heavier then an equal
bulk of water: But then the hand, that
draws up the Bucket by the Rope
<hi>F E,</hi> ought not, according to our
Doctrine, to feel the weight of all the
Bucket, much leſs that of the water
contein'd in it. For though that aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of wood and iron, which we here
call the Bucket, be heavier then ſo
much water; yet it tends not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with its whole weight, but only
with that ſurpluſage of weight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98187:123"/>
it exceeds as much water as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to it in Bulk; which ſurpluſage
is not wont to be very conſiderable.
And as for the water in the Cavity,
<hi>G,</hi> of the Bucket, there is no reaſon
why it ſhould at all load the hand at <hi>E,</hi>
though really the water both in the
Bucket and over it do tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with their full weight; becauſe
that the reſt of the water, <hi>L I,</hi> and <hi>M K,</hi>
do full as ſtrongly preſs upon the reſt
of the imaginary Superficies <hi>I K,</hi> as
the Bucket aud the incumbent water
do upon the part <hi>H:</hi> and conſequently
the bottom of the Bucket is every
whit as ſtrongly preſs'd upwards by the
weight of the water, upon all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the plain <hi>I K;</hi> as it tends
downwards, by virtue of the weight
of the Incumbent water, that is partly
in the Bucket, and partly above it;
and ſo theſe preſſures ballancing one
another, the hand that draws the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98187:124"/>
Rope at <hi>E,</hi> has no more to lift up then
the ſurpluſage of weight, whereby
the empty Bucket exceeds the weight
of as much water as is equall in bulk
(I ſay, not to the Bucket as 'tis a hollow
Inſtrument, but) to the wood and iron
whereof the Bucket conſiſts.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this Example of the
lightneſs of fil'd Buckets within the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
has for ſo many Ages gain'd credit
to, if it have not been the only ground
of, the aſſertion, That water weighs
not in its own Element, or in its proper
place; I ſhall add (though I can ſcarſe
preſent it to ſuch a <hi>company</hi> as this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſmiles) an Experiment that I made
to convince thoſe, that were, through
unskilfulneſs or prejudice, indiſpos'd to
admit the Hydroſtatical account I have
been giving of the phaenomenon. I
took then a round wooden Box, which
I ſubſtituted in the room of a Bucket;
and (having fill'd it with melted
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98187:124"/>
Butter, into which, when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal'd,
ſome ſmall bitts of lead were
put, to make it a little heavier then ſo
much water,) I caus'd a ſmall ſtring
of twin'd ſilk to paſs through two ſmall
holes, made in the oppoſite parts of the
upper edge of the box, and to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
at one end of the beam of a
pair of Gold-ſmiths Scales; and then
putting it into a veſſel full of water, till
it was let down there, to what depth
I pleas'd, it appear'd that not only the
leaſt endeavour of my hand would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſupport it, or tranſport to and
fro in the water, or draw it up to the
top of it; and this, whether the box
were made uſe of, or whether the
butter and lead alone, without the box,
were ſuſpended by the ſilken ſtring:
but (to evince, that it was not the
ſtrength of my hand, or the ſmallneſs
of the immers'd body, that kept me
from feeling any conſiderable reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,)
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98187:125"/>
I caſt ſome grains into the
ſcale that hung at the other end of the
above mention'd Beame, and preſently
rais'd the Lead and Butter to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the water. So that unleſs the
Schoolmen will ſay that the butter &amp;
lead were in their own Element; we
muſt be allow'd to think, that the eaſie
ſuſtentation, and elevation of the box,
did not proceed from hence, That
thoſe bodyes weigh'd not becauſe they
were in their natural place. And yet in
this caſe, the effect is the ſame with
that which happens when a bucket is
drawing out of a well.</p>
               <p>And, to manifeſt that 'twas the
preſſure of the water againſt the lower
part of the ſurface of our ſuſpended
body, that made it ſo eaſie to be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the water, or rais'd to the top of
it; I ſhall add, that though a few grains
ſuffic'd to bring the upper ſurface of
the butter to the top of the water:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98187:125"/>
yet afterwards there was a conſiderable
weight requiſite, to raiſe more &amp; more
of its parts above the waters ſurface;
&amp; a conſiderabler yet, to lift the whole
body quite out of the water. Which
is very conſonant to our Doctrine. For,
ſuppoſe the bucket to be at the part
<hi>N,</hi> half in and half out of the water:
the hand or counterpoiſe, that ſupports
it in that poſture, muſt have a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtrength then needed to ſuſtein it,
when it was quite under water; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that now the imaginary plain
<hi>P Q,</hi> paſſing by the bottom of the
bucket, has on its other parts but a
little depth of water, as from <hi>L</hi> to <hi>P,</hi>
or <hi>M</hi> to <hi>Q,</hi> and conſequently the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the bucket, <hi>H,</hi> will ſearce be
preſs'd upwards above half as ſtrongly
as when the bucket was quite under
water. And if it be raiſed to <hi>O,</hi> &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
quite out of the water; that
liquor reaching no longer to the bottom
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98187:126"/>
of the bucket, can no longer contribute
to its ſupportation; and therefore a
weight not only equal, but ſomewhat
ſuperiour to the full weight of the
bucket, and all that it contains, (being
all ſuppos'd to be weighd in the aire,)
will be neceſſary to lift it clear out of
the water.</p>
               <p>But to dwell longer on this ſubject
cannot but be tedious to thoſe that have
been any thing attentive to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Diſcourſes. I proceed therefore
to our Authors ſixth Argument, which
is,</p>
               <p>Object. 6. That Horſe-hairs, which
are held to be of the ſame gravity with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
keep whatever place is given them in
that Liquor; nor are depreſs'd by the weight
of the ſuper-incumbent water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether the matter of fact
beſtrictly and univerſally true, is ſcarce
worth the examining, eſpecially ſince
we find the difference in point of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98187:126"/>
gravity, betwixt moſt Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haires,
and moſt waters, to be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
enough. But the phaenomenon,
ſuppoſing the truth of it, is very eaſily
explicable, according to the Doctrine
above deliver'd. For ſuppoſing in the
laſt Scheme the body, <hi>R,</hi> to be bulk for
bulk exactly equiponderant to water;
'tis plain there is no reaſon why that
body ſhould preſs the part <hi>S,</hi> of the
imaginary Superficies <hi>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> K,</hi> either
more or leſs then that part <hi>S</hi> would
be preſs'd, if, the body <hi>R</hi> being anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated
or remov'd, it were ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by parcel of water of juſt the
ſame bulk and weight. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
though all the water directly
above the ſolid <hi>R</hi> do really lean upon
that body, and endeavour to depreſs it;
yet that endeavour being reſiſted by an
equal and contrary endeavour, that
proceeds (as we have been but too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
faine to declare) from the preſſure
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98187:127"/>
exercis'd upon the other parts of the
Superficies, <hi>I K,</hi> by the water incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on them; the body, <hi>R,</hi> will be
neither depreſs'd nor rais'd. And its
caſe being the ſame in what part of
the water ſoever it be plac'd, provided
it be perfectly environ'd with that
Liquor; it muſt keep in the water
(which in this whole Diſcourſe we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to be Homogeneous as to gravity)
the place you pleaſe to give it.</p>
               <p>And, (to add That on this occaſion)
though Mathematicians have hitherto
contented themſelves to prove, that in
caſe a Body could be found or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that were exactly equiponderant
to water, it would retaine any aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
place in it; yet the Curioſity we
had, to give an Experimental proof of
this Truth, at length produc'd ſome
glaſs Bubbles, which ſome Gentlemen
here preſent have not perhaps forgot,
that were (by a dexterous hand we
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98187:127"/>
employ'd about it) ſo exquiſitely pois'd,
as, to the wonder of the Beholders, to
retain the places given them, ſometimes
in the middle, ſometimes near the top, &amp;
ſometimes near the bottom of the water
(though that were Homogeneous) for a
great while, till ſome change of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
or gravity in the water, or ſome
of its parts, made the bubble riſe or fall.</p>
               <p>The Application of this, to what
has been objected concerning Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hairs,
being too eaſie to need to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
on, there remains to be diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
our Authors ſeventh and laſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
which is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 7. That, otherwiſe, all the
inferiour parts of the water would be in
perpetual motion, and perpetually expell'd
by the Superior.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if, by the inferior parts,
he means, ſuch portions as are of any
conſiderable bulk; the Anſwer newly
made to the laſt objection (where we
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98187:128"/>
ſhew'd that the body, <hi>R,</hi> would retain
its place any where in the water, and
conſequently near the bottome) will
ſhew the invalidity of this Objection.
And unleſs we knew of what bigneſſe
and ſhape the Corpuſcles of water are,
it would perhaps be to little purpoſe
to diſpute how far it may be granted,
or may be true in the particles that
water is made up of. Onely this I
ſhall add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That, whereas this Learned
Authour mentions it as an abſurdity,
that the lower parts of water ſhould
be in perpetual motion: And <hi>Stevinus</hi>
himſelf, in the beginning of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droſtatical
Elements, ſeems to me to
ſpeak ſomewhat inconſiderately of this
matter; and though, as I lately ſaid,
I allow ſuch ſenſible bodies, as thoſe
whoſe gravity in water Writers are
wont to diſpute of, to be capable of
retaining their places in water, if they
be <hi>in ſpecie</hi> equiponderant to it: Yet I
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98187:128"/>
am ſo far from thinking it abſurd, that
the inferiour Corpuſeles of water
ſhould be perpetually in motion; that
I ſee not how otherwiſe they could
conſtitute a Fluid body, That reſtleſs
Motion of their parts, being one of the
generaleſt Attributes of Liquors; and
being, in water, though not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be <hi>ſeen,</hi> yet to be eaſily <hi>diſcover'd</hi>
by its Effects: As, when Salt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
caſt into water, the aqueous parts
that are contiguous to it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
near to the bottom, do ſoon
carry up many of the faline ones, to
the very top of the water; where, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while, they are wont to diſcloſe
themſelves in little floating grains of a
Cubical ſhape.</p>
               <p>But, of this reſtleſs motion of the
parts of Liquors having profeſſedly
treated elſewhere already;<note place="margin">In the Hiſtory of fluidity &amp; firmneſs</note>
I ſhall add nothing at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
But rather take
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98187:129"/>
notice of what our Authour ſubjoyns
to the laſt of his Arguments, (as the

               <p>The common Anſwer of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers

               <p>But, by his favour, notwithſtanding

For I have abundantly prov'd, that
(contrary to the Aſſertion on which

of water preſs againſt the lower, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a body heavier or lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi>
then water be underneath the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
And, the contrary of which being
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this Controverſie,
perhaps the matter may be ſomewhat
cleard, by mentioning here a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98187:131"/>
which I ſometimes make uſe of. I
conſider then a body may be ſaid to
gravitate upon another body in two
ſenſes. For ſometimes it actually ſincks
into, or gets beneath the body that was
under it, as a ſincking ſtone gravitates
upon water, and which I call Praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
or ſucceſsful Gravitation; &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it does not actually, at leaſt not
viſibly deſcend, but only exerciſes its
gravitation by preſſing againſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
body that hinders its deſcent; as
when a VVoman carries a Paile of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on her head, though the weight do
not actually get nearer the Center of
the Earth; yet actually preſſes with
its whole gravity upon the Womans
head, and back, and other ſubjacent
parts that hinder its actual deſcent;
and according to this Doctrine I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
admit our Authors reaſoning, that
becauſe a mans body is bulk for bulk
heavier then water, therefore the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98187:131"/>
does not endeavour to place its ſelf
beneath it. For water, being a heavy
body, derives from the cauſe of its gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
(what ever that be) an inceſſant
endeavour towards the Center of the
Earth; nor is there any Reaſon, why
its happening to be incumbent on a
body heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then it ſelf, ſhould
deſtroy that endeavour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though it may be ſaid that the
water does not endeavour to place it
ſelf beneath a humane body, becauſe
indeed an inanimate Liquor cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be ſaid to act for this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end; yet the water being a heavy
body, tends continually towards the
lower part of the Earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will get beneath any body that is
plac'd betwixt it and that, (without
regard whether the inferior body be
heavier or lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then it ſelf)
as far as the degree of its gravity will
enable it; nor would it ever reſt, till
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98187:132"/>
it have reach'd the lowermoſt parts of
the Earth, if the greater ponderouſneſs
of the earth and other heavy bodies did
not hinder, (not its endeavour down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
nor its preſſure upon ſubjacent
bodies, but only) its actual deſcent.</p>
               <p>This Learned Author himſelf tells
us, (as well as <hi>Stevinus,</hi> and others, that
have written of the Hydroſtaticks, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
teach,) that if the bottom of
a veſſel be parallel to the Horizon, the
weight of water, that reſts upon it, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to a pillar of water, having that
bottome for its Baſis, and for its height
a perpendicular reaching thence to the
uppermoſt Surface of the water. Nor
is it reaſonable to conceive that there
will be any difference in this preſſure
of the incumbent water, whether the
bottom be of Deale that will ſwimme,
or of Box that will ſinck in water; or
to ſpeak more generally, whether it be
of Wood, <hi>in ſpecie</hi> lighter then water,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98187:132"/>
or of Copper, or ſome other Metal,
that is <hi>in ſpecie</hi> heavier then it. And
ſince water, being not a ſolid Body,
but a fluid, conſiſts (as other fluids)
of innumerable Corpuſcles, that,
though extreamly minute, have their
own ſizes and figures; And ſince the
preſſure of water upon the bottom of
a veſſel is proportionate to its perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
height over the bottom; 'Tis
manifeſt, that the upper Corpuſcles
preſs the bottom as well as the lower;
which, ſince they cannot do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
they muſt do by preſſing the
intermediate ones. And I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſhown (diſcourſing one of the
former Paradoxes,) that the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
parts of water do not onely preſſe
thoſe that are directly under them, but
communicate a preſſure to thoſe that
are aſide of them, and at a diſtance
from them.</p>
               <p>And if it be objected, That water
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98187:133"/>
endeavours to get beneath a Bottome
of Glaſs Veſſels, or other bodies hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
<hi>in ſpecie</hi> then its ſelf, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that bottome there is aire, which
is a body lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then water:
I ſay, that this is precarious; for the
indiſputable gravity of the water is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
ſufficient to make it always tend
downwards, (though it cannot always
move downwards) what ever body
be beneath it. And who can aſſure the
makers of this Objection, That there
are not beneath even the bottome of
Rivers, or of the Sea, (where yet they
ſay water is conſiſtent, and reſts as
in its own place,) vaſt ſpaces repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
but with aire, fumes, or fire, or
ſome other body lighter then water?
For, (not to mention that the Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
take the Earth we tread on, to be
but a thin Cruſt of the Terreſtrial
Globe, whoſe inſide, as farre as the
Center, is repleniſh'd with a ſubtle fluid
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98187:133"/>
matter, like that whereof the Sunne
conſiſts.) We know that in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as particularly at a Famous Coal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there are great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
that reach a good way under
that ground that ſerves there for a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
to the Sea: So that, for ought
theſe Objectors know, ev'n according
to their own Doctrine, the water ev'n
in the Sea, may endeavour to get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
a body heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>But, for my part, I cannot but
think, that, to imagine the water
knows, whether or no there be aire or
ſome lighter body then it ſelf beneath
the body it leans on, and the ſuperior
parts do accordingly exerciſe or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
their preſſure upon the inferior;
is to forget that it is a heavy Liquor,
and an inanimate Body.</p>
               <p>Another Solution there is of this
Hydroſtatical problem, we have been
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98187:134"/>
diſcourſing of, which I met with in a
Printed Letter of Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi>
in theſe terms.</p>
               <p>Je ne me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I remember not what
reaſon 'tis that <hi>Stevinus</hi> gives,<note place="margin">Second Tome lettre 32.</note>
why one feels not weight of
water, when one is under it: but the true
one is, that there can no more of water gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate
upon the body that is in it, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, then as much water as could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
in caſe that body left its place.
Thus for Example:<note place="margin">Fig. 22.</note> If there
were a Man in the Barrel, <hi>B,</hi>
that ſhould with his Body ſo ſtop the hole,
<hi>A,</hi> as to hinder the waters getting out, he
would feel upon himſelf the weight of the
whole Cylinder of water, <hi>A B C,</hi> of
which I ſuppoſe the Baſis to be equal to
the hole <hi>A;</hi> for as much as if he ſunck
down through the hole, all the Cylinder
of water would deſcend too, but if he be
a little higher, as about <hi>B,</hi> ſo that he does
no longer hinder the water from running
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98187:134"/>
out at the hole <hi>A,</hi> he ought not to Feel any
weight of the water which is over him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>B</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> becauſe if he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
toward <hi>A,</hi> that water would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
with him, but contrarywiſe a part of
the water which is beneath him towards
<hi>A,</hi> of equal bulk to his Body, would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
into its place: ſo that in ſtead of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the water to preſs him from the Top
downward, he ought to feel that it buoys
him upward from the bottome; which by
Experience we ſee.</p>
               <p>Thus far this ſubtil Philoſopher:
for whoſe Ratiocinations though I am
wont to have much reſpect, yet I
muſt take the liberty to confeſs my
ſelf unſatisfy'd with this. For have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already ſufficiently prov'd, That
the upper parts of water preſs the
lower, and the bodies plac'd beneath
them, whether ſuch bodies be lighter
<hi>in ſpecie</hi> then water or heavier; we
have ſubverted the Foundation, upon
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98187:135"/>
which Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s ingenious,
though unſatisfactory, Explication is
built. And yet I ſhall add <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti,</hi>
That ſuppoſing what he ſayes,
That in caſe the ſolid <hi>B</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
towards <hi>A,</hi> the incumbent wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would not deſcend with it, but a
part of the ſubjacent water, equal in
bulk to the ſolid, would aſcend, and
ſucceed in its room; yet that is but
accidental, by reaſon of the ſteinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and fulneſs of the Veſſel. And
though indeed the Superior water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
actually deſend upon the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the ſolid at <hi>B,</hi> if, at the ſame
time while that body deſcends, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
bulk of water ſucceeds in its
place: Yet both the ſolid about <hi>C,</hi>
and the water that ſucceeds it, do, in
their turns, hinder the deſcent of the
Superior water; which therefore muſt
gravitate upon which ſoever of the
two it be that actually comes to be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98187:135"/>
plac'd directly under it, if there be
nothing, before the diſplacing of the
ſolid, capable to take away the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
gravity, upon whoſe account the
water, over <hi>B</hi> and <hi>C,</hi> does inceſſantly
tend downwards. And though Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> does not ſo clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
himſelfe, whether he ſuppoſes
the hole at <hi>A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to be ſtopp'd with ſome
other body, when the ſolid is plac'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>B:</hi> yet, becauſe he is wont to
ſpeak conſiſtently, I preſume he means,
that when the ſolid is remov'd to <hi>B,</hi>
the hole at <hi>A</hi> is otherwiſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
ſtopp'd; I ſay then, that the
reaſon why the ſolid, which, whilſt at <hi>A,</hi>
ſuſtain'd a great preſſure from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
water, feels not the weight
of it, when plac'd at <hi>B,</hi> is not that
which <hi>Monſieur des Cartes</hi> gives, but
this, That the ſolid being environ'd
with water, the ſubjacent water does (as
we have often had occaſion to manifeſt)
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98187:136"/>
preſs it upwards, full as ſtrongly (and
ſomewhat more) as the weight of the
incumbent water preſſes it downwards;
So that a mans body, in ſtead of ſinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
would be buoy'd up; if, as it is a
little heavier, it were a little lighter <hi>in
ſpecie</hi> then water. Whereas, when the
ſolid was that alone which cover'd and
ſtop'd the hole, there was a manifeſt
Reaſon why it ſhould be forcibly
thruſt downwards by the weight of the
incumbent water <hi>B C.</hi> For, in that caſe,
there was no water underneath it at <hi>A,</hi>
to ſupport the ſolid; and, by its preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
upward, to enable it to reſiſt ſo
great a weight.</p>
               <p>And this, (to hint that upon the by)
may perchance help us to gueſs at the
reaſon of what Geographers relate of
the Lake <hi>Aſphaltites</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> (in caſe
the matter of fact be true,) That this
dead Sea (as they alſo call it) will not
ſuffer any living creature to ſinck in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:98187:136"/>
it. For the Body of a Man (and for
ought we know of other Animals,) is
not much heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi> then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
freſh water: Now if in this Lake
(that ſtands where <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi>
did, before thoſe impious Regions
were deſtroy'd by fire from Heaven,)
we ſuppoſe, (which the nature of the
Soyle, and the Sacred Story makes
probable enough) That the water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with Saline or Sulphurous
Corpuſcles; (the former helping the
later to aſſociate with the water, as we
ſee in ſope conſiſting of ſalt and oyle,
and in Chymical mixtures of Alcalis
and Brimſtone diſſoluble in water) the
Liquor may have its gravity ſo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
as to become heavier <hi>in ſpecie</hi>
then the body of an animal. For I have
learned of a Light Swimmer, that he
could hardly begin to Dive in ſalt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
though he eaſily could in freſh.
And 'tis not difficult to make a Brine
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98187:137"/>
or <hi>Lixivium</hi> (which are but Solutions
of ſalt in water,) heavy enough to keep
up an egg from ſincking. And, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
barely by diſſolving a metalline body
in a ſaline <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> without other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
thickning the Liquor, I have
brought ſolid pieces of Amber it ſelf to
ſwim upon it: but I have try'd that
certain ſaline Solutions, which I elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
mention; nay, and a diſtill'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
(I us'd defleam'd oyle of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol)
without any thing diſſolv'd in it,
would do the ſame thing; by reaſon
of the numerous, though minute, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles
of ſalt and ſulphur, that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with.</p>
               <p>There remains but one ſolution
more of our Hydroſtatical probleme,
that I think worth mentioning, and that
is given by the Learned <hi>Stevinus</hi> in

               <p>This Solution of <hi>Stevinus,</hi> I eſteem
preferrible by farr, to thoſe that are
wont to be given of this difficult Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme:
But yet, the Phaenomenon
ſeems to me to have ſtill ſomewhat in
it of ſtrange. 'Tis true, that if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
were only that which ſome put,
<hi>viz.</hi> Why the body of a Diver, when
it is near the bottom of the Sea, is not
preſs'd down by ſo vaſt a weight of
water, as is incumbent on it; It might
be rationally anſwer'd, That the
weight of ſo much water, as leans up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the body, is not ſuſtein'd by the
force of the body it ſelf, but by that
of the water which is under it. For,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98187:138"/>
by the Experiments and Explications,
we have annexed to ſome of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Paradoxes, it appears, That the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
water, by its preſſure upwards,
is able, not only to ſupport the weight
of the incumbent water, but ſo far to
exceed it, that it would not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the immers'd body, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
water, but buoy up the body,
if it were never ſo little lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi>
then water. And as for what <hi>Stevinus</hi>
inſinuates, That, when the water
preſſes the body every way, that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is not felt, though it would be,
in caſe it preſs'd upon ſome parts, and
not upon others; I am of the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
too; and, to prove it, ſhall not
make uſe of the example he propoſes,
in the words immediately following
thoſe of his, I juſt now recited: (For I
doubt, that example is rather a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
then a try'd thing;) but by
an Experiment which may be eaſily
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98187:139"/>
made, and has diverſe times been ſo, in
our Pneumatical Engine. For, though
the aire be a heavy fluid, and though,
whilſt it uniformely preſſes the whole
ſuperficies of the body, we feel not the
preſſure of it. And though, for this
reaſon, you may lay the palm of your
hand upon the open orifice of a ſmall
braſs Cylinder, apply'd to the Engine
inſtead of a Receiver, without any hurt;
Yet when, by pumping, the aire that
was before under the palm of your hand,
is withdrawn, and conſequently can no
longer help to ſupport your hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the preſſure of the external and
incumbent aire; the external aire will
lean ſo heavy upon the back of your
hand, that you will imagine ſome pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
weight is lay'd upon it. And I
remember by ſuch an Experiment, I
have not onely had my hand put to
much pain, but have had the back of it
ſo bent downward, as if it were going
to be broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:98187:139"/>
But though ſuch conſiderations, as
theſe, may much leſſen the difficulty
of our phaenomenon, whoſe cauſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
into; Yet ſtill it ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
odd to me, That (ſince 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the nature of the thing, and
by <hi>Stevinus</hi>'s his confeſſion, that there
is a vaſt preſſure of water againſt every
part of the body, whoſe endeavour tends
inward,) ſo exceedingly forcible a
preſſure, (which thruſts, for inſtance,
the Muſcles of the Arms and Thighs
againſt the Bones, the Skin and Fleſh
of the Thorax againſt the Ribs,)
ſhould not put the Dives to any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pain; As I find not (by one that
I examin'd) that it dos; (Though this
man told me, he ſtay'd a good while
at the depth of betwixt 80 and 100
foot under the Sea water, which is
heavier then freſh water;) For, that
which <hi>Stevinus</hi>'s Explication will only
ſhowis, That there muſt be no mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98187:140"/>
diſlocation of the greater parts of
the Body; whereas the bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of two ſmall parts, one againſt
another, is ſufficient to produce a ſenſe
of pain.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems, the Texture of the
bodyes of Animals is better able to
reſiſt the preſſure of an every way
ambient fluid, then, if we were not
taught by experience, we ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
And therefore, to ſatisfie thoſe
that (ſecluding the Queſtion about the
ſenſe of pain,) think it an abundantly
ſufficient Argument, (to prove, that
bodyes immers'd under water, are not
compreſs'd by it;) That <hi>Divers</hi> are
not oppreſs'd, and ev'n cruſh'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſo
vaſt a load of water, (amounting, by
<hi>Stevinus</hi>'s computation, to many
thouſands of pounds) as is incumbent
on them. We will add, that though an
Experiment, propos'd by Monſieur
<hi>Paſchal</hi> to this purpoſe, were ſuch,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98187:140"/>
that at firſt ſight I ſaid that it would
not ſucceed, (and was not upon tryal
miſtaken in my conjecture;) yet it
gave me the occaſion to make another,
which will, I hope, fully make out the
thing I deſign'd it for.</p>
               <p>The Ingenious Monſieur <hi>Paſchal</hi>
would perſwade his Readers, that if
into a glaſs Veſſel, with luke-warm
water in it, you caſt a flie; and, by a
Rammer, forcibly preſs that water,
you ſhall not be able to kill, or hurt the
flie. VVhich, ſays he, will live as well,
and walk up and down as lively, in
luke-warme water, as in the aire. But,
upon tryal with a ſtrong flie, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
was (as we expected,) preſently
drowned, and ſo made moveleſs, by the
luke-warm water.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we ſubſtituted another
Experiment, that we knew would not
only ſucceed, (as you will preſently ſee
it will do,) but teach us how great a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98187:141"/>
preſſure the included Animal muſt
have been expos'd to. VVe took then
a ſomewhat ſlender Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical
pipe of Glaſs,<note place="margin">Fig. 24.</note> ſeal'd
at one end, and open at the
other; and to this we fitted a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
which (by the help of ſome
thongs of ſoft leather, that were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
wound about it) did ſo exactly
fill the pipe that it could not eaſily be
mov'd to and fro; and would ſuffer
neither water, nor aire, to get by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
it, and the internal ſurface of the
Glaſs. VVe alſo provided ſome ſmall
Tad-poles (or <hi>Gyrini)</hi> about an Inch
long or leſs; which ſort of Animals
we made choice of before any other,
partly becauſe they could, by reaſon of
their ſmalneſs, ſwim freely to &amp; fro in
ſo little water as our pipe contain'd; &amp;
partly becauſe thoſe Creatures, being
as yet but in their Infancy, were
more tender, and, conſequently, far
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98187:141"/>
more expos'd to be injur'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
then other Animals of the
ſame Bulk, but come to their full age
and growth, would be, (as indeed ſuch
young Tad-poles are ſo ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that they ſeem, in compariſon to the
bigger ſort of flies, to be but organiz'd
Gelly.) One of theſe Tadpoles being
put into the water, and ſome Inches
of aire being left in the pipe, for the uſe
anon to be mention'd; the water and
aire, and conſequently the Tadpole,
were by the intruſion of the plug or
rammer, with as great a force as a man
was able to imploy, violently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd;
and yet, though the Tadpole
ſeem'd to be compreſs'd into a little
leſs Bulk then it was of before, it
ſwom freely up and down the water,
without forbearing ſometimes to aſcend
to the very top, though the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were held perpendicular to the
Horizon. Nor did it clearly appear to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98187:142"/>
us, That the little Animal was injur'd
by this compreſſion; and moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
it is, he was not cruſh'd to death,
or ſenſibly hurt by it.</p>
               <p>And having repeated this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeveral times, &amp; with Tadpoles of
differing ages; we may, I preſume, ſafely
conclude, That the Texture of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
is ſo ſtrong, that, though water be
allowed to weigh upon water, yet a
<hi>Diver</hi> ought not to be oppreſt by It:
Since, whether or no water weighs in
water, 'tis manifeſt that in our Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the water, and conſequently the
Tadpole, was very forcibly by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Agent compreſs'd betwixt the
violently condens'd aire, and the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
And, by the notice we took of
the quantity of aire before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
began, and that to which it
was reduc'd by compreſſion; The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateſt
eſtimate we could make, was,
That it was reduc'd into an <hi>eighth,</hi> or
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98187:142"/>
                  <hi>tenth</hi> part of it's former ſpace; and ſo
(according to what we have elſwhere
prov'd) the preſſure that was upon the
aire, (and conſequently upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the included Tadpole,) was
as great as that of a Cylinder of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of above 200 if not 300 foot high.
And yet all this weight being unable
to oppreſs, or ſo much as manifeſtly
to hurt, the tender Tadpole (which
a very ſmall weight would ſuffice to
have cruſh'd, if it preſt only upon one
part of it, and not upon the other) we
may thence learn the Truth of what
we have been endeavouring to evince:
That though water be allowed to preſs
againſt water, and all immers'd Bodys;
yet a <hi>Diver</hi> may very well remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppreſs'd
at a great depth under water,
as long as the preſſure of it is uniforme
againſt all the parts expos'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
