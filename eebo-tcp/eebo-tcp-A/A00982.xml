            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight High, Right Excellent, and gracious ſweete Prince, (in all humilitie) I beſeech your Highneſſe to pardon me, in that (being one of the meaneſt among the King your Fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants) I haue preſumed to Dedicate this ſimple ſmall Treatiſe to your Excellencie: the Subiect whereof is notwithſtanding ſuch and ſo great, as may ſeeme vnmeete to bee tearmed a Subiect. For, it treateth onely of Kings and Princes; all excellent Worthies: a matter (I confeſſe) much vnbefitting my ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der capacity, and leſſe learning, to deale with. In which regard, I cannot but acknowledge, the true Prouerbe moſt fitte to bee applied
<pb facs="tcp:18602:3"/>
againſt me, <hi>Blinde Bayard is the boldest horſe in the Cart.</hi> Notwithſtanding, that, which hath ſpurred me forward to commit the fault, may (I hope) in ſome meaſure, qualifie and excuſe it; to weet, my ſeruent loue and zealous heart: which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not endure, your Grace ſhould paſſe by me, without ſome little teſtimony of my great ioy, zeale, and bounden duety: howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in the maner of expreſſing it, my diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may perhaps be worthily taxed, and my inſufficiencie layed open to the world. But to proceede on: The Worthies, here recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are nine in number; all <hi>Henries,</hi> al mighty Potentates: eight of which haue already been Souereigne Kings of this renowmed Nation; ſeuen of them excelling in Martiall valour and conqueſt, one of them (namely, King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt) in vertue and pietie, (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſinne and himſelfe) and none of them much inferiour to ſome of the ancient nine Worthies. Now, your Highneſſe being of the ſame name with them, and Heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the ſame Dominions, which thoſe eight Worthies (your glorious Anceſtors) ſometime held, and the bleſſed ſonne of a mighty Monarch; the eye of the World is

vpon you, and lookes for a tranſparent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of their vertues into you, and a reflexion from you: the ioy and comfort of this famous Realme of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> (aſwell in Church as Common wealth) is ſet and ſettled in and vpon you, next to our King and preſent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Gouernour. And their hopefull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation hath already inſtalled you the ninth Worthy; as being likely (in time) I ſay not, to equall the eight, but euen to ſurmount and exceed them. For, as the ages, ſince theirs, haue been illuſtrated with more learning, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and diuine wiſedom: ſo, beſides your gifts of Nature (who, in perfections, hath not been niggardly towards you) your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe taking alſo your princely and happie education in a time of peace, and that vnder the wings and eyes of the moſt learned King your father, vertuous Queene mother, and ſuch a Councel of ſettled and deep wiſedom, as not the like in <hi>Europe;</hi> your Highneſſe, I ſay, hath (herein) meanes, examples, and leaſure to heare, learne, behold, and obſerue the ſingular goodneſſe of God, in that, which hereafter ſhall be your owne greatneſſe and happineſſe.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Obles and Gentlemen: Pleaſe yee to peruſe the Chronicles of this Realme, you may therein reade of many your famous and worthy Progenitors, who (ſome of them by Valour; the reſt, by Wiſedome and their other vertues) haue growen great in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereignes fauour, been preferred to high Place in Common wealth, liued and died in much glorie; leauing an ouer-plus of honour and dignitie (by many deſcents) to you their children. The conſideration hereof may, and (I doubt not) wil, incite and egge you on (who are already well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the way) to tread the ſame ſteps of honour, by imitating thoſe your worthy Anceſtors in their vertuous actions. For, your tender yeeres are
<pb facs="tcp:18602:5"/>
not ignorant, that The readieſt way to get (and ſureſt to hold) true honour, is to deſerue it; and (conſequently) that Vertue onely, which firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Nobilitie, must ſtill maintaine it: whereas, contrariwiſe, by degenerate and baſe conditions, many forfeit their Nability, ere they come at it. For, who knowes not, that Nobilitie, without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue, is but apocryphate Gentry? and that, therefore, as it began in vertuous Anceſtors; ſo it endeth in their wicked progenie. We ſee, The ſtrongeſt wine becomes the ſharpeſt vineger: and, The moſt Noble, by nature, are made moſt vile by negligence. Of which Ranke and ſort, are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as hold learning in ſcorne, and the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of knowledge not worth the while. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of whom, truely and eloquently was it (long ſince) written by M. <hi>Aſcham; The fault is in your ſelues, ye Noble-mens ſonnes (and therefore ye deſerue the greater blame) that commonly the meaner mens children come to be the wiſeſt Counſailors, &amp; greateſt doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the weighty affaires of this Realme: and why? For, God will haue it ſo by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; becauſe yee will haue it no otherwiſe by your negligence.</hi> And againe, <hi>It grieueth me to ſay (but it helpeth not to hide) what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb facs="tcp:18602:5"/>
man ſees; Tis ſeldome ſeene, that the ſonne of an excellent man prooues excellent.</hi> I graunt, that in excellent men, Nature muſt frame the chiefest parts: but learning addeth a further ornament, groundeth a deeper iudgement, and formeth perfection, and excellencie, in ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time. The beſt learned are beſt aduiſed. And, No man is deceiued, but in thoſe things whereof he is ignorant. In a word: What ſoeuer may bee ſaydin dispraiſe of Ignorance, is the praiſe of Learning and Knowledge. Wherefore, I trust, your Honours, and the reſt, <hi>wil thinke it as great ſhame</hi> (which alſo are M. <hi>Aſchams</hi> words) <hi>to be valiant and Courtly without Learning, as to be ſtudious and bookiſh without Valour.</hi> My ſeruent prayers, to almighty God, ſhall be ſo to direct your generous hearts to the ſtudie of good literature, with the loue of vertue and true valour, that you alwayes (not onely in time of this your tender youth) may be found meete Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen to attend ſo worthy a Prince.

                  <p>HE was a man of good ſtature and very wel formed, of comely conntenance, partly red hayred, grey eyes, of wit quicke, and perfect good memory, ſo that he could remember long al things of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he had eyther heard or ſéene; of body ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fleſhy, and ſtrong, and could abide very patiently the diſpleaſures both of colde and heate, he had a large head, a broad breaſt, and very ſpare of dyet, the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not be too fat, therefore when he was at leaſure and free from warres, his exerciſe was hunting, and progreſſe trauels.</p>
                  <p>He was a Prince of ſtout ſtomacke and inuincible courage, more reſolute and conſtant in time of aduerſitie, then in proſperitie: liberall to all men, but chiefely vnto ſouldiers. Pittifull to the poore (an excellent vertue and nature in a Prince). For proofe whereof in a time of dearth which happened in <hi>Aniow</hi> and <hi>Mayne,</hi> hee did at his owne coſt and Princely pitty: feede ten thouſand poore people euery day with good victuals, from the firſt of Aprill till the laſt of Iuly, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1176. And aboue his Princely and moſt magnificent houſe-keeping he ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red garners, cellars, and ſtore-howſes, religious perſons and their howſes. Tributes and Taxes he tooke verie ſeldome, and thoſe not great. Hee was very expect in feates of warre, and no leſſe fortunate therin. He would praiſe his Captaines and men of warre after their deaths to encourage thoſe that liued; hee was well learned as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18602:13"/>
thoſe Princes aforeſayde, and excéeding wiſe. His care to haue Iuſtice duly adminiſtred in his Realme was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding great, in ſo much that finding that the Sheriffs in his time were rather inclined to ſeek their owne gaine, then to deale vprightly with his ſubiects, hee appointed Sapraniſors ouer them to ouer ſée their doings, as if they had béen Controllers, ſo as an awfull regard made them circumſpect, and wary in their doings. He ordained alſo puniſhment for Hunters in Forreſtes and groundes of warren, either by fines or byimpriſonment. He ordained that murtherers ſhould be hanged, other offences he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with loſſe of limmes, and otherwiſe as the qualitie of the offence required. Moſt carefull hee was to haue iuſtice adminiſtred without corruption. He tryed men of ſundry ſorts to execute iuſtice with iuſtice, but in fine hee referred it to the Biſhops and Clergy men, hoping in that profeſſion to finde the moſt integritie: and yet he little regarded the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or feared his cenſures, as is manifeſt by the hiſtory of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> in this Kings time, and ſundry others.</p>

And conſidering with himſelf what charge hee had in hand, and what appertained to his duty and office, he truſted not too much to his owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Iudgement, and directions: but as is aforeſayde he called to his Counſell ſuch honourable perſonages as might aſſiſt him in the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſo weighty a charge to inſtruct him with ſuch good reaſons and fruitefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, as that thereby he might ſhewe himſelfe to his ſubiects, a Mirror of vertue, and an example of iuſt and vpright dealing.

And further that the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and the other Princes ſhould remaine priſoners till his ſonne came to lawfull age, leaſt by returning they might kindle more fire in one day, then could well be quenched againe in thrée.

                  <head>His Deſcription.</head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Henry</hi> was a king whoſe life was immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and his liuing without ſpot, this king was a prince whom all men loued, and was of none enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this prince was a Captaine againſt whom fortune neuer frowned, nor miſchance once ſpurned: this Captaine was a Shepheard, whom his flocke both loued and obeyed. This Shepheard was ſuch a Iuſtitiary, that he left no offence vnpuniſhed, nor good deſert vnrecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced &amp; fully rewarded. This Iuſtitiary was ſo feared, that all rebellion was baniſhed, and Sedition ſuppreſſed. His vertues were no more notable then his other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were worthy of prayſe. In ſtrength, and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of body, from his youth fewe or none were to him comparable. In wreſtling, leaping, and running, no man (almoſt) durſt with him preſume. In caſting of great iron bars, &amp; heauie ſtones, he excelled commonly al men: cold weather neuer made him ſiothful, nor hot cauſed him to ſhrink, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he moſt labored his head was vncouered:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18602:22"/>
he was no more weary of his armor, then of a light cloak. Hunger and thirſt to him were neuer noyſome, he was neuer afraide of a wounde, nor would ſhrink for the paine in dreſſing, he neither turned his noſe from ill ſauoures, nor from ſmoake and duſt would cloſe his eyes, no man could be found more temperate in eating and drinking, whoſe dyet was not too delicate, but rather more méete for men of warre, then for dainty and delicate perſons: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery honeſt perſon was permitted to come to him euen ſitting at meales, and either ſecretly or openly to declare their minds, and intent: high and waighty cauſes as wel betwéen men of warre, as other he would gladly heare, and either determine them himſelfe, or commit them to other to giue ſentence. He ſlept very little, and that was mooued either by bodily labour, or vnquietneſſe of minde: but béeing in ſléepe no ſmall noiſe could awake him; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as when his ſouldiers did ſing, or minſtrels play in the campe that it ſounded withall, then hee ſlept moſt ſoundly. His courage was inuincible and his heart ſo immutable that fear was baniſhed from him. If an <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> chanced to be raiſed by his enemies he was the firſt in armor, and the firſt that would ſet forward: in the time of warres he would not only get knowledge what his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies did, but what they ſayd, and intended to do; ſo that all things to him, were knowne aforehand. And of his deuiſes, fewe perſons before the execution of his purpoſed intent ſhould be made priuie: he had knowledge in the ordering and guiding of an army, and ſuch a rare gifte to encourage his men to fight, that the Frenchmen ſayde it was impoſſible for him to be vanquiſhed in battaile: he had ſuch wit, ſuch prudence, and ſuch policy, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enterpriſed any thing before he had fully debated it, and foreſéen al the maine chances that might happen: and when the end was once concluded, he with all diligence and courage ſet his purpoſe forward. What policy hée

had in finding ſodaine remedies, from preſent and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous miſchiefes, and what practiſe he vſed in ſauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his people in ſodain diſtreſſes, except by his acts they did plainely appeare, it would ſéeme incredible to be tolde; and no leſſe admirable how hee did abſtaine from laſciuious liuing, and auaritious deſires in ſuch time and eſtate of riches and prouoking youth. In the time of loſſe he was no more ſad then in the times of victory, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy fewe Princes haue euer vſed. To ſpeake of his bounty and liberality, no man could be more free, gentle and liberall in beſtowing rewardes vpon all perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts: ſauing that hee did not regarde money to kéepe, but to giue away, and to ſpend. What may beſayd? he was the Myrror of al Chriſtendome, and the glory of his Country, the flower of Kings paſſed, and the glaſſe of all ſuccéeding Maieſtie. No Prince had leſſe of his ſubiects, no king conquered more: whoſe fame by his death liuely floriſhed, as his acts in his life were ſéene and remembred. The loſſe of ſuch a Prince could not bée ſufficiently lamented of his ſubiectes: blaming fortune for taking away ſo precious a iewel, ſo noble an ornament ſo ſure a defence: for no doubt ſo much hope as was taken away from the Engliſhmen (the aſſured conqueſt of all <hi>France)</hi> by his ſodaine death, ſo much truſt was increaſed in the French nations ſtomackes to recouer their late loſſes againe; as not many yeares after they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed: <hi>Peeter Baſſet</hi> Eſquier, and one of his chamber, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that he dyed of a <hi>Pleuriſy,</hi> there were others that did aſtirme otherwiſe, but the moſt likely was a <hi>Pleuriſy</hi> indeed; the nature of that diſeaſe being then vnknowen to Phiſicians, or to the world in thoſe dayes eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>This King raigned nine yeares, fiue moneths and three and twenty dayes: and liued not full thirty eight yeares: he was of ſtature higher then the common ſort, of body leane, ſingularly proportioned and ſtrongly made,

He was ſober, modeſt, moderate, honeſt, curteous, bountious; ſo much abhorring pride, and arrogancy, that he was euer ſharpe and quicke to all about him noted with that fault, he was alſo an vpright Iuſtice: by the which one propertie he wan to him the heartes of many people. He left to that luſtie valiant and gallant young Prince his ſonne and heyre many excellent good partes and properties of a Prince, as alſo Coffers full ſtuffed with coyne, iewells and treaſure. To conclude, he had in him as many good giftes both of body and minde, and fortune as it was poſſible for any King to haue: his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke wiſedome in gouernance was u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ngular, his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome alwayes aſſured, reaſons pithy and ſubſtantiall, his memorie freſh and holding, his experience notable, his counſels fortunate and taken by wiſe deliberation, his ſpeeches grations in diuers languages: leagues and confederations he had with all Princes Chriſtian, his mighty power was dread euery where both within his owne Realme and without, all his people were to him in humble ſubiection as euer they were to King: his land many a day in peace and tranquilitie, his proſperitie in battayle againſt his enemies was maruellous: his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in time of perils and dangers was cold and ſober, with great hardineſſe.
