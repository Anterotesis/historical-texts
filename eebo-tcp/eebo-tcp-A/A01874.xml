            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Great, and long suspition was held of this person to be a witch, and the eye of Mr. <hi>Arthur Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> a worthy Iustice of Peace, who dweleth at <hi>Totnam</hi> neere to her, was watchfull ouer her, and her wayes, and that not without iust cause; stil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his former long suspition of her, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of her neighbours that dwelt about her: from suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, to proceed to great presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, seeing the death of Nurse-children and Cattell, strangely and suddenly to happen. And to finde out who should bee the author of this mischiefe, an old ridiculous custome was vsed, which was to plucke the Thatch of her house,
<pb facs="tcp:18135:4"/>
and to burne it, and it being so burnd, the author of such mischiefe should presently then come: and it was obserued and affirmed to the Court, that <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer</hi> would presently frequent the house of them that burnt the thatch which they pluckt of her house, and come without any sending for.</p>
            <p>This triall, though it was slight and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, yet it setled a resolution in those whom it concerned, to finde out by all meanes they could endeauour, her long, and close carried Witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to explaine it to the world; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried, to pay in the ende such a worker of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, her wages, and that which shee had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, (namely, <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>Death</hi>) from which the Diuell, that had so long deluded her, did not come as shee said, to shew the least helpe of his vnto her to deliuer her: but being descried in his waies, and workes, immediately he fled, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her to shift and answere for her selfe, with publike and priuate markes on her body as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Her face was most pale &amp; ghoast-like with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bloud at all, and her countenance was still deiected to the ground.</item>
               <item>2 Her body was crooked and deformed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen bending together, which so happened but a little before her apprehension.</item>
               <item>3 That tongue which by cursing, swearing, blaspheming, and imprecating, as afterward she
<pb facs="tcp:18135:4"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fessed, was the occasioning cause, of the Diuels accesse vnto her, euen at that time, and to claime her thereby as his owne, by it discouered her lying, swearing, and blaspheming; as also eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofes produced against her, to stop her mouth with Truths authority: at which hearing, she was not able to speake a sensible or ready word for her defense, but sends out in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Iudge, Iury, and all good people that stood by, many most fearefull imprecations for destruction against her selfe then to happen, as heretofore she had wished and indeauoured to happen on diuers of her neighbours: the which the righteous Iudge of Heauen, whom she thus inuocated, to iudge then and discerne her cause, did reueale.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus God did wonderfully ouertake her in her owne wickednesse, to make her tongue to be the meanes of her owne destruction, which had destroyed many before.</p>
            <p>And in this manner, namely, that out of her false swearing the truth whereof, shee little thought, should be found, but by her swearing and cursing blended, it thus farre made against her, that both Iudge and Iurie, all of them grew more and more suspitious of her, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great cause: for none that had the feare of God, or any the least motion of Gods grace left in them, would, or durst, to persume so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently,
<pb facs="tcp:18135:5"/>
with execrations and false oathes, to affront Iustice.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, being the fourteenth day of Aprill, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1621. this <hi>Elizabeth Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> late of <hi>Edmonton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> Spinster, was arraigned, and indited three seuerall times at Iustice Hall in the Old Baily in <hi>London,</hi> in the Parish of Saint <hi>Sepulchers,</hi> in the Ward of Farrington without: which Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That shee the said <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer,</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the feare of God before her eyes, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and seduced by the Diuell, by Diabolicall helpe, did out of her malicious heart, (because her neighbours where she dwelt, would not buy Broomes of her) would therefore thus reuenge her selfe on them in this manner, namely, witch to death their Nurse Children and Cattell. But for breuities sake I here omit formes of Law and Informations.</p>
            <p>She was also indited, for that shee the said <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth Sawyer,</hi> by Diabolicall helpe, and out of her malice afore-thought, did witch vnto death <hi>Agnes Ratcleife,</hi> a neighbour of hers, dwelling in the towne of <hi>Edmonton</hi> where shee did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dwell, and the cause that vrged her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto was, because that <hi>Elizabeth Ratcliefe</hi> did
<pb facs="tcp:18135:5"/>
strike a Sowe of hers in her sight, for licking vp a little Soape where shee had laide it, and for that <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer</hi> would be reuenged of her, and thus threatned <hi>Agnes Ratcleife,</hi> that it should be a deare blow vnto her, which accordingly fell out, and suddenly; for that euening <hi>Agnes Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleife</hi> fell very sicke, and was extraordinarily vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a most strange manner in her sicknesse was tormented, Oath whereof, was by this <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Ratcleifes</hi> Husband, giuen to the Court, the time when shee fell sicke, and the time when shee died, which was within foure dayes after she fell sicke: and further then related, that in the time of her sicknesse his wife <hi>Agnes Ratcleife</hi> lay foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the mouth, and was extraordinarily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered, which many of his neighbors seeing, as well as himselfe, bred suspition in them that some mischiefe was done against her, and by none else, but alone by this <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer</hi> it was done; concerning whom the said <hi>Agnes Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleife</hi> lying on her death-bed, these wordes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently spake: namely, that if shee did die at that time shee would verily take it on her death, that <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer</hi> her neighbour, whose Sowe with a washing-Beetle she had stricken, and so for that cause her malice being great, was the occasion of her death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18135:6"/>To proue her innocency, she put her selfe to the triall of God and the Countrey, and what care was taken both by the honourable Bench and Iury, the iudicious standers by can witnesse: and God knowes, who will reward it.</p>
            <p>The Iury hearing this Euidence giuen vpon oath by the husband of the aboue named <hi>Agnes Ratcliefe,</hi> and his wiues speeches relating to them likewise an oath, as she lay on her death-bed, to be truth, that shee had said vnto her husband; Namely, that if she dyed at that time, shee the said <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer</hi> was the cause of her death; and maliciously did by her Witchery procure the same.</p>
            <p>This made some impression in their mindes, and caused due and mature deliberation, not trusting their owne iudgements, what to doe, in a matter of such great import, as life, they dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med might be conserued.</p>
            <p>The Foreman of the Iury asked of Master <hi>Heneage Finch</hi> Recorder, his direction, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to whom hee Christianlike thus replyed, namely, <hi>Doe in it as God shall put in your hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Master <hi>Arthur Robinson,</hi> a worshipfull Iustice of Peace dwelling at <hi>Totnam,</hi> had often &amp; diuers times, vpon the complaints of the neighbours against this <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer,</hi> laboriously and carefully examined her, and stil his suspition was strengthened against her, that doutlesse shee was
<pb facs="tcp:18135:6"/>
a Witch. An Information was giuen vnto him by some of her Neighbours, that this <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer</hi> had a priuate and strange marke on her body, by which their suspition was confirmed against her, and hee sitting in the Court at that time of her triall, informed the Bench thereof, desiring the Bench to send for women to search her, presently before the Iury did goe forth to bring in the verdict, concerning <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Sawyer,</hi> whether that shee was guilty or no: to which motion of his, they most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condescended.</p>
            <p>The Bench commanded officers appointed for those purposes, to fetch in three women to search the body of <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer,</hi> to see if they could finde any such vnwonted marke, as they were informed of: one of the womens names was <hi>Margaret Weauer,</hi> that keepes the Sessions House for the City of <hi>London,</hi> a widdow of an honest reputation, and two other graue Matrons, brought in by the Officer out of the streete, passing by there by chance, were ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with her in this search of the person named, who fearing and perceiuing shee should by that search of theirs be then discouered, behaued her selfe most sluttishly and loathsomely towards them, intending thereby to preuent their search of her, (which my pen would forbeare to write
<pb facs="tcp:18135:7"/>

And they all three said, that they a little aboue the Fundiment of <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer</hi> the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there indited before the Bench for a Witch, found a thing like a Teate the bignesse of the little finger, and the length of halfe a finger, which was branched at the top like a teate, and seemed as though one had suckt it, and that the bottome thereof was blew, and the top of it was redde. This view of theirs, and answere that she had such a thing about her, which boldly shee denied, gaue some insight to the Iury, of her: who vpon their consciences returned the said <hi>Elizabeth Sawyer,</hi> to be guilty, by dibolicall help, of the death of <hi>Agnes Ratcliefe</hi> onely, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted her of the other two Inditements.

            <p>And because it should not bee thought that from me alone this proceeded, I would haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther testimony thereof to stop all contradictions of so palpable a verity, that heard her deliuer it from her owne mouth in the Cappel of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> the same time.</p>

               <p>I, with all my heart and minde.</p>
               <p>This was confirmed, in the hearing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundreds at her last breath, what former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shee in prison confessed to me, and at that time spake more heartily, then the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of her execution, on whose body Law was iustly inflicted, but mercy in Gods power reserued, to bestow, when and where hee pleaseth.</p>
               <p>My labour thus ended concerning her, to testifie and auouch to the world, and all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers hereof, this to be true; those that were present with me in the prison, that heard her confession, I haue desired here their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which is as followeth.</p>

               <p>Deare Christians, lay this to heart, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cause, and first time, that the Diuell came vnto her, then, euen then when she was cursing, swearing, and blaspheming. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell rageth, and mallice reigneth in the hearts of many. O let it not doe so, for heere you may see the fruites thereof, that it is a playne way to bring you to the Diuell; nay that it brings the Diuell to you: for it seemed that when shee so fearefully did sweare, her oathes did so coniure him, that hee must leaue then his mansion place, and come at this wretches commande and will, which was by her impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. Stand on your guard and watch with sobrietie to resist him, the Diuell your aduersary, who waiteth on you continually,

to subuert you<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that so you, that doe detest her abhominable wordes, and wayes, may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taste of the cup nor wages of shame and destruction, of which she did in this life: from which and from whose power, Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> saue, and defend thy little flocke. <hi>Amen.</hi>
