            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the Duties in particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Maſters and Miſtreſſes, in relation
to their Servants?</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:38470:4"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are ſeveral: Firſt, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of their Authority in Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
They are to command nothing that
is Sinful: For Maſters, in their Families,
being the Vice-gerents of God, they ought
to Order nothing contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God, by whoſe Authority they
act. And if they give Orders contrary to
this their Commiſſion, they are not only
to anſwer for their own Sin, but likewiſe
for the Sins of their Servants, complying
with ſuch their undue Orders.</p>
               <p>Again, they ought not to hinder their
Servants from doing what God requires of
them. And ſince God has given Command
to Servants, as well as to all other Chriſtians,
to Worſhip him, to ſeek the <hi>Kingdom of
God,</hi> and to work out their <hi>Salvation,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are not to hinder their Servants from
complying with theſe Duties, which God
exacts from them; neither directly, by
forbidding them, nor indirectly, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
them with ſo much Buſineſs, as
to allow them no opportunity for ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commands of God. For this is
to incurr the guilt of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Sin, who,
when God had commanded the Children
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to go and offer Sacrifice to him
in the Deſart, doubled their Tasks, and by
new Burthens confin'd them at home.</p>

               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38470:5"/>
               <p>Secondly, Where God's Service is not
particularly concern'd, there ought yet to
be Moderation in all Commands, ſo as not
to burthen Servants with more Work,
than they are well able to do. For tho'
it be a great Fault, to let Servants live
without Buſineſs, ſo to betray them to
all the Miſchiefs of Idleneſs; yet to be
unconcern'd at the Hardſhips put upon
Servants, and not to value what they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
is a great Fault too, not only in the
want of Compaſſion, but of Charity;
which being the love of our Neighbor as
of our ſelves, cannot allow of this Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of laying on Burthens, without any
Conſideration for thoſe, who are to bear
them.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell, but it may look Great,
to Command without Compaſſion; and I
know a Wordly and Covetous Spirit
thinks nothing too much for Servants,
when it carries with it the proſpect of
Intereſt. But however it may look, it is
certain there is no Greatneſs in it, but
that of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> for there can be no Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity,
where there is ſo much Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
there is none but a ſlaviſh Spirit is
fit to make Slaves. And as for the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and Worldly Temper, 'tis ſo Mean
and Baſe in it ſelf, that there needs no
more to mark the Oppreſſion of Servants
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38470:6"/>
with Infamy, than to ſee it the Fruit of
that Contemptible Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Rule therefore ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both Extremes, ſo as to keep Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
employ'd, for their own ſakes, as
well as their Maſters, and yet ſtill with
that Moderation, as to conſider what is
neceſſary for their Health and Reſt, and
not to think, that becauſe their Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
make them ſerve, they therefore
have no Senſe or Feeling. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
is one Ingredient of the Good
Chriſtian; and where-ever 'tis excluded,
either by Paſſion, Imperiouſneſs, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
or Immoderate Niceneſs, there
is the Reſemblance of an Ill Compound,
which has Gall thrown in inſtead of
Honey.</p>

               <p>AS there is to be Moderation in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
ſo likewiſe in the way of

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:38470:7"/>
yet they are not to be treated as
Dogs. If ſome are of that ſlaviſh Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that they will do nothing, except
they be ill treated, then it is they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that make the ſpur neceſſary: But
this muſt not be taken up as a Plea to
juſtifie Paſſion or Pride in other Caſes.
For certainly, there are many Servants,
whoſe Fidelity and Willing Temper
need not Paſſion to puſh it on: And here
all Peeviſh and Imperious Commands, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Words or Tone of the Voice, is
an Argument of their Weakneſs, who are
in Power.</p>
               <p>A like Moderation is to be us'd in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fault, and Reproving; becauſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
ought to be ever Juſt and Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and it cannot be ſo, but by bearing
proportion with the Fault; now theſe
being very different; as ſome being the
Effect of Careleſneſs, ſome of Sloth, ſome
of Miſtake, ſome of Overſight, enquiry
ought to be firſt made, before Reproof
be given, for otherwiſe it may do more
harm than good, by creating an ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of their Injuſtice, who give it.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, It cannot be allow'd, to find
fault with every thing a Servant does;
for, beſides it being the certain way to
keep Servants in an ill Humor, there is
nothing can more diſcourage them from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38470:8"/>
being Induſtrious, than when, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the beſt of their Care, they
are ſure to be blam'd. This Nice, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptious
Temper, that is never to be
pleas'd, may eaſily ſpoil, but will never
make a Good Servant. But it puniſhes it
ſelf in its own uneaſineſs, by many
Changes bringing ſometimes ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
into the Houſe, whoſe Crimes
ſhew them the unreaſonableneſs of their
Impatience, in not bearing with ordinary
Failings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They ought not with Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
declaim againſt ſuch Faults, which are
no more than Overſights, or the Effect of
ſome Accident; becauſe it is not Juſt;
and with thoſe of a Good Temper, it is
very unreaſonable, ſince the very Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it ſelf is Grief enough, without the
addition of a Maſter's Paſſionate Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which only ſerve to change the
Grief into Confuſion, and inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Servant more careful, puts him
beyond himſelf, and makes him not
know what he does.</p>
               <p>But, Thirdly, If Servants are faulty
thro' Neglect or Careleſneſs, I except not
againſt Reproof, but approve it as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
and think thoſe Maſters are very
much to be condemn'd, who paſſing by
ſuch Faults in ſilence, give their Servants

Encouragement to become good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
In this Caſe too much Eaſineſs is
Weakneſs, and Connivance is not Charity,
but the Silence of an Enemy.</p>
               <p>But then the Reproof ought to be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Perſon and the Fault: Some
are to be treated with ſharpneſs, ſuch
whoſe Dull or Heedleſs Temper has no
Life, but from the Spur: And others will
be prejudiced by this Severity. In all
Caſes Reproof is to be reaſonable, and
therefore as free from Paſſion, as may be,
becauſe this ſeeing nothing right, is not
qualified either for being Judge, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice. For which reaſon S. <hi>Paul</hi>
cautions Maſters againſt it, adviſing them
to forbear threatning, and putting them
in mind, that they alſo have a Maſter in
Heaven, with whom there is no reſpect
of Perſons, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 9. Where he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
not Maſters from giving juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
but puts them in mind of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
how they do it; becauſe they
likewiſe are Servants of a Maſter in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
who will call them to an Accompt,
for whatever they do againſt their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
unreaſonably, and in Paſſion.</p>

that nothing be wanting neceſſary

ſpend their Lives, and often hazard their

               <p>This is very unlike the Spirit of the
Centurion, mention'd in the Goſpel, who
when his Servant was Sick, ſent ſome
Principal Men of the <hi>Jews</hi> to petition

               <p>THis Care of Maſters ought to be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extended, even to the Care of
their Servants Souls; ſo far at leaſt, as to
ſee, they perform their Duty to God, in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38470:12"/>
doing Good, and avoiding Evil, as far as
falls within Family-Diſciplin.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, They are to examin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſay their Prayers, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Public Worſhip of God. The
Ignorance or Careleſs Temper of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of this Inſpection and Concern in
Maſters, and the Omiſſion of this Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
is enough to draw upon them the
guilt of their Servants Neglects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are to ſee, they have
time to perform theſe Duties; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are to take Care, they be not ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd

a real hindrance, and if it be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſo, there is a neceſſity of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
how it may be moderated. Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Works cannot be omitted; but how
many things are there in a Family, which
are the Commands only of Pride, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,

more reaſonable in a Chriſtian, that ſome
of theſe at leaſt ſhould be retrench'd,
than that Servants, for giving attendance

If the thing be conſider'd, Faith

allowing them ſo much time at leaſt,
that they may not be forced to renounce
the Practice of Chriſtianity, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the Weakneſs or Vice of
thoſe whom they ſerve.</p>
               <p>This enquiry again ought to be made,
becauſe many make Exceſſive Buſineſs
their Excuſe for not Praying, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
other Spiritual Duties, when
in reality 'tis nothing better than Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;
and Sloth is at the Root of all
their Omiſſions. For which Reaſon,
Maſters ought to Examin their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that ſo they may confound the
Slothful with their Neglect, and help
to Contrive for thoſe of better Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who have a Good Will, but for
want of Management cannot find Time
to Pray.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This enquiry ought to be
made with a ſtricter Eye, as to <hi>Sundays</hi>
and Holy-days, to ſee, if they take care
to Sanctifie them, according to their
Inſtitution. The great Liberty in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning
theſe Days, or at leaſt, in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them over, without any Concern
for anſwering the purpoſes, for which
they were ordain'd, ought to preſs
Chriſtian Maſters to call their Servants
to an Account. And a Principal care
ought to be, on their own parts, to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38470:14"/>
ſee, that by unneceſſary Buſineſs they
be not hinder'd in the Duties of thoſe
Days: Nay more, they ought to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
things ſo, and exact ſo little Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from them, that having their time
at Command, the Maſters may be in
no danger, of their Servants Neglects
being charg'd upon them.</p>
               <p>Hence it cannot but be adviſable, on
theſe Days, to diſpence with that Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which on other Days may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
in Cleaning of Rooms. Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may be ſo order'd, as to excuſe a
great part of their uſual Drudgery in
preparing it, and of the Attendance in
waiting unſeaſonably at Table. Viſits
may be excluded till a fitting time, and
going abroad, with Retinue, put off,
till the Duty of the Day be over. By
this and other like Management, thoſe
who have the Care of Families may
ſhew the beſt kind of Compaſſion to
their Servants, in giving them great
Opportunities for Saving their Souls,
and taking all Excuſes out of their
Hands.</p>
               <p>But ſince no part of the Duty of theſe
Days can be well perform'd without
due Inſtruction in the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
hence are Maſters to ſee, that their
Servants have all neceſſary Convenience
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38470:14"/>
for being Taught what they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to know. Many are ſo unhappy,
either in their Education, or the Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Temper, that 'tis not a little
help, will ſerve for their Inſtruction;
this Circumſtance is therefore to be well
conſider'd, and Proviſion muſt be made
for every one according to their Wants:
If ſome Service be excus'd for Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
this ſo neceſſary Work, the
Maſters will be no loſers in the End;
ſince, beſides the Reward they will have
from God for this Charity, they may
Hope to be better ſerv'd; there being
nothing that can better ſit Servants for
being every way Faithful to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
than the due Knowledge of their
Duties to God. The want of this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
being a general Occaſion of their
failing in many Obligations, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to their State, and running into
Diſorders.</p>

               <p>THIS Care again of Maſters ought

               <p>Thoſe Heads of Families, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
exaſperated upon the Ordinary
Neglects of Servants in the Buſineſs of

of their own unhappy State,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38470:15"/>
in being ſo Solicitous for the things of

for the next. And tho' this may not
touch them at preſent, yet the effect of
this Indifferency will fall Heavy at laſt,
when they ſhall be call'd to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for all the Sins of their Servants,
which have been encourag'd by their
Silence, and grown up under the favor
of their Connivance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe then, who will eſcape the
weight of this Charge, muſt with a
watchful Eye inſpect all the Ways of
their Servants, as to the Method of
their Converſation at home, and all
the Circumſtances of their going abroad,
both as to the Places and Company they
frequent, and the Hours of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out and returning home. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this care, how ſhall Maſters be able
to give an Account of their Servants?
And what will the Diſciplin of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
be, when Youth are left to the
Liberty of their own Inclinations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Apprehenſion of any to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or controul them?</p>
               <p>Whence I cannot but think thoſe
Maſters much to Blame, whoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
being early diſcharg'd every
Evening from their Buſineſs and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
have ſome Hours left to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38470:16"/>
their own Diſcretion, without being
call'd to any Account of their Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For thoſe, who Reflect on the
Corruption of our Age, and the little
Confidence, that can be had in unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
Years, muſt ſee, that this is
nothing leſs, than putting into the
Hands of Youth daily Opportunities of
ruining themſelves: And ſuch Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Inſtances there are of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
abus'd, to the Irrecoverable loſs of
Youth, that 'tis a ſubject deſerves
Tears; eſpecially when we conſider the
ſad Diſappointment of Parents, who
after a Pious Education, having placed
out their Children, and being ſatisfied
in the Proviſion they have made for
their Livelihood, find them afterwards
loſt to all that is Good, by the Neglect,
of their Maſters, and the unreaſonable
Liberties they have given them.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence of this Sin, both
in the Affliction of Parents, and in the
Ruin of Youth, brings ſo heavy a
Charge after it, that I cannot ſee, how
Maſters will be able to anſwer it;
ſince 'tis ſeldom in their Power to make
any Reparation for the Miſchiefs they
do by ſuch Neglects; which have ſtill
a greater Aggravation of guilt, if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the Diſorders of their Clerks or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38470:16"/>
Apprentices, they purpoſely let them
go on, that ſo, when out of their
Time, there may be no probability of
their taking Clients or Cuſtomers out
of their Hands; for this has ſuch a
Complication of Injuſtice in it, that
it would be a Reproach even in a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and therefore not to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd
with the Principles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Profeſſion All Heads of Families
then, who have Thoughts of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for another World, muſt be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that all thoſe under their Care, be
a daily part of their Care, in adviſing
and reproving, and cutting off, as
much as may be, all the Opportunities,
by which the Indiſcretion of Youth is
induſtrious in drawing Miſchief on it
ſelf: For without this Care, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>ONE Principal part of this Care
muſt be in giving Good Example
to their Servants; for without this the
beſt Advice cannot be expected to be
very ſucceſsful: As to all Family-duties
therefore, thoſe, who are the Heads,
ought to be moſt Regular, as in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and keeping good Hours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
ſince nothing can go on well in any
Family, where Diſciplin is not obſerv'd,
this muſt be a daily part of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
Concern, to ſee, that good Order
be kept, and not only, that it be kept
by others, but that he be Punctual, as
far as Buſineſs will permit, in leading
the way. For if he, by any Habitual
Diſorder, gives ill Example, it muſt
needs make his Advice Ridiculous, and
it cannot but be fear'd, but where
there is ſo much Ignorance and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it will ſoon have Followers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the Care, that can be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38470:17"/>
us'd by others, for Authority is more
prevalent in Evil, than in Good; and
therefore to think, that a Family ſhould
be Regular, and the Maſter only Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
is a Thought without Experience,
and can give no more than groundleſs
Hopes.</p>
               <p>I conclude now theſe Duties of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
with that of being Juſt to their
Servants, in the due Payment of their
Wages, and of complying with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
other Conditions were agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at their Enterance; for tho' they
were made only with Servants, yet
Juſtice ought to be as ſtrictly obſerv'd
with them, as with others, who have
both Power and Money to make good
their Right. God requires this at the
Hands of Maſters, and 'tis with the
Addition of ſuch Threats to ſuch as fail
in it, that if from them the guilt be
Meaſur'd, the Conſequence of no other
Sin can more juſtly be Apprehended,
than of this Oppreſſion, which Cries to
Heaven for Vengeance.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rules may ſerve for Maſters,
as far as concerns their Servants; but
there being ſtill many other Difficulties,

expect the Cenſure to be moderated.
But the Evil of Trading being not in
the Profeſſion, but in the Abuſes of it,
I come to thoſe Rules, which may ſerve
for ſome help in avoiding them.</p>
               <p>For a General Rule, I ſet down this
Principle; That no Chriſtian ought to
do an Injuſtice to his Neighbor. This
is more particularly applied by S. <hi>Paul</hi>
to Buyers and Sellers, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. where,
after this Preamble, Ver. 2. <hi>You know,
what Commandments we gave you by the
Lord Jeſus:</hi> He inſtances ſeveral of theſe
Commandments, and then adds this
belonging to our preſent purpoſe, Ver.
6. <hi>That no Man go beyond and defraud</hi> (or,
as in the Margin, <hi>over-reach) his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in any Matter; becauſe that the Lord is
the Avenger of all ſuch, as we alſo have
forwarn'd you, and teſtified.</hi> It is one
Commandment then of Jeſus Chriſt,
deliver'd and publiſh'd by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to
all the Profeſſors of the Goſpel: <hi>That
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38470:19"/>
no Man defraud or over-reach another in any
Buſineſs.</hi> And I wiſh it were writ in
great Characters in every Shop and
Place of Trade, that it might be a Rule
to all that are concern'd, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their deſire of Gain be, they may
be diſcourag'd from ſeeking it, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching
or defrauding their Neighbor,
of which God has declar'd, that he will
be the Avenger.</p>
               <p>This then is the Rule, Plain and
Poſitive; by it are to be examin'd
the General Methods of Traders, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Buying and Selling; and in
whatever Caſe there is any thing of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
or Over-reaching, it muſt, of

the Goſpel will not allow, and God will

               <head type="sub">Frauds and Injuſtice in the Goods
they Sell.</head>
               <p>IN regard of the thing that is Sold,
there may be Fraud and Over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many ways; as, Firſt, If that which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38470:19"/>
is Damag'd or Imperfect, be Sold for
Good in its kind, for Sound and Perfect.
For thus the Buyer is over-reach'd,
in having that put into his Hands for
Good, which is not Good; and if he
pays the Price of Good, he is defrauded,
ſince he pays for what he has not.</p>
               <p>I do not here except againſt the Arts
of ſetting off Goods, where the deſign
is no more, than to encourage Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers
to give a Juſt and Lawful Price
for them, according to their true Value.
But if theſe Arts are made uſe of to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Cuſtomers, in making thoſe
Goods paſs for Good, which are not
ſo, and for bringing in a Price above
their real Value; then all ſuch Arts,
as far as they ſerve for this End, muſt
be condemn'd as Unlawful, ſince their
whole deſign it to over-reach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud
the Buyer, which is expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There may be Fraud and
Over-reaching, as to the thing Sold,
if the Buyer declaring the End and Uſe
of the Goods he asks for, the Seller
puts ſuch Goods into his Hands, which
are altogether unfit for that uſe, for
which they are bought.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a Perſon Sells, that,
which is not his own: For here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38470:20"/>
the Injuſtice done the right Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
he that Buys it is wrong'd, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Price for that, which, when pay'd
for, is not his own, but muſt be reſtor'd,
and may be ſeiz'd by the Owner, if
ever it comes to his Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If a Perſon Sells that,
which may be Prejudicial to the Buyer;
as in Apothecaries making up their
Bills with Drugs, that are either pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd,
or, at leaſt, do not anſwer the
Intention of the Phyſician: For thus
the Phyſician is impoſ'd on, and the
Patient wrong'd both in Money, Health
and Life.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If a Perſon Sells that, which
cannot be Sold; as in taking Money
for that which is Spiritual, or annex'd
to Spiritual, for this is Simony.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If a Perſon Sells that, which
ought not to be Sold, as being in it
ſelf Sinful, or immediately tending to
Sin; ſuch are all ſorts of Immodeſt
Pictures, Books, Songs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as likewiſe
all Books of Irreligion and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and of ſuch Errors, as are evidently
contrary to the Truth of the Goſpel.
For tho' there be no wrong done to the
Buyer, as to the Price of ſuch Goods,
yet there is an Injuſtice, in thus help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to betray the Cauſe of God, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38470:20"/>
directly Contributing to the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sin, That Chriſtians ſhould
do this for Gain, is an Action ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of what they profeſs, that I cannot
ſee, but that keeping on ſuch a Trade,
is joining with <hi>Judas,</hi> in betraying
Chriſt, in Selling the Goſpel and their
Souls; and what will be the Fruit of
ſuch Gain, but the loſs of all?</p>

               <head>SECT. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">In the Price.</head>
               <p>THere may be Fraud and Injuſtice
in the Price of what is Sold, by
exacting an unreaſonable Rate. There
is a Gain allow'd to all that Trade,
but this Gain has its bounds; and tho'
theſe cannot be ſo fixt in Particular, as
to condemn all Exceſs of Oppreſſion;
yet there is no one, who Trades, but
from that Common Light of Reaſon
and Juſtice, which God gives to every
Soul, may eaſily diſcover, when he
acts againſt that, which is Reaſonable
and Juſt. They all know the true
Value of their Goods; they know the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38470:21"/>
Circumſtances, which raiſe or leſſen
their Value; they know the Rates, at
which they are generally Sold, and
their own Conſcience bears Teſtimony
againſt them, when making an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Buyer, they take of him
a Price exceeding both the Value and
Common Rates of ſuch Goods.</p>
               <p>Such is the Injuſtice, when a Perſon
coming to Buy, who neither knows
the Price of the Goods, nor when they
are Good in their kind, has either
Faulty Goods put upon him, or ſuch a
Price exacted from him, as far exceeds
their Value. For this is evidently
over-reaching him, by taking an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> This is the Buyer's fault, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
what he does not underſtand. <hi>Caveat
Emptor;</hi> 'Tis the Buyer's part, to take
Care he be not impos'd on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis an overſight indeed for a
Man, when he is amongſt Pick-pockets,
not to take Care of his Purſe: And
would you have every Man, that goes
into a Shop, think this to be his Caſe?
If he ought to think ſo, then the Fault
of an Ignorant Chapman, is in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Shopkeepers to be Honeſter than
they are. And ſo in reality it is, if they
ſtand ready in their Shops to over-reach
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38470:21"/>
all they can, and then only do it not,
when a Cuſtomer's Skill and Caution
will not give them Opportunity for it.</p>
               <p>Truly if this be all the Honeſty of
Shopkeepers, 'tis like that of Robbers,
who quietly paſs by thoſe, who ſeem
too well arm'd againſt them: But how
far is this from the Juſtice requir'd of
them by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who expreſly gives
them Command, Not to over-reach or
defraud any? If their Duty then be to
over-reach none, and this Principle of
Juſtice ought ſo to poſſeſs their Souls,
as to give them a Horror of all Frauds,
and to Tie up their Hands from all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
and God demands this at their
Hands; how wretched muſt be the
State of their Souls, who, as if there
were no ſuch Command, defraud all they
can, and ſpare only thoſe, who will
not be deceiv'd by them?</p>
               <p>If this be the Method of Traders,
then 'tis true now, that ſuch Traders
cannot pleaſe God, and that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
can be ſuch a Trader, becauſe
God's Will and Commands are no Barr
upon their Conſcience, but they give
themſelves up to their Covetous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
contrary to all the Principles of
Truth and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>But this is not the only Injuſtice in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38470:22"/>
taking the Advantage of a Buyer's want
of Experience or Skill; 'tis much the ſame
of any other Advantage, that is taken, for
raiſing the Price above what is juſt; as
in Caſe of ſome preſent Diſtreſs or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
obſerv'd in the Buyer; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
upon diſcovering ſuch Neceſſity,
exacts more than is due, is Guilty of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and Extortion, and overthrows,
in this, all the Principles of the Goſpel,
by being then Barbarous and Cruel,
when Circumſtances oblige to Charity,
Tenderneſs and Compaſſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there can be no leſs than Infinit
Woes pronounc'd againſt thoſe, who
upon this Conſideration, exact upon
the Poor, or ſuch, who by unhappy
Circumſtances are brought into
Streights, and God will be the Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of ſuch Iniquity.</p>
               <p>'Tis not much Inferior to this, if a
Perſon being earneſtly bent on a thing,
reſolves to have it on any Terms; and
this being obſerv'd, the Seller raiſes it
to an Extravagant Price: For tho' here
he has the Opportunity of a good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket;
yet ſince the Phancy of the Buyer
adds nothing to the real Value of his
Goods, he has no other Motive for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them ſo high, but only the fair
Opportunity of making a Prey: And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38470:22"/>
what does this betray in him, but the
Diſpoſition of thoſe above-mention'd,
who are ready to catch at all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
and ſtand waiting for thoſe, who
are fit to be deceiv'd?</p>
            </div>

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">In the Seller.</head>
               <p>THere may be Injuſtice in the Seller,
if by Lying he endeavors to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
his Cuſtomers that his Goods are
Sound and Perfect, when they are not
ſo; or that their Value is much above
what they deſerve. This is more Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
if he adds Oaths and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to gain Credit to his Lies; for
then there is a double Iniquity; in the
Injuſtice of his Price, and in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
by which he prevails on the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomer
to give it.</p>
               <p>Lies have not that notorious Guilt,
when they are only Perſwaſives to a
Juſt Price; nay, the Hardneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
of Cuſtomers is ſuch, that they
ſeem almoſt neceſſary for thoſe, who
think to Sell. But however, this is
not enough to juſtifie the Practice; for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38470:23"/>
ſince Lies are expreſly forbid by God,
they muſt be judg'd unlawful, by as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
as believe in him, and make his
Will the Rule of their Conſcience, and
therefore are not to paſs for Innocent,
even when they are to perſwade a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomer
to give a Juſt Price.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, the Hardneſs of
Cuſtomers is a great Temptation, and
the fear of loſing Trade puſhes it on.
And is not this a ſtrange Character of a
Chriſtian World, that believing Truth
and Juſtice to be the Way to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Truth, there is ſcarce ſuch a thing
to be found amongſt them, as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of any being True and Juſt;
but in all Buſineſs there is as general a
Diſtruſt, as if there were no Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them? The Hardneſs of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers
makes Shopkeepers Swear and
Lie; and therefore are Cuſtomers Hard,
becauſe they know Shopkeepers will
Swear and Lie. Both have ſomething
to Mend, and I think, thoſe, who keep
Shop may ſafely begin, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being much Loſers by it. For I
cannot but believe, that if a Perſon
were ſo exact to Truth, that thoſe who
come to Buy, could have a Confidence in
him, that he would neither demand
an unreaſonable Price, nor put off
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38470:23"/>
things for Good, which are not ſo,
this would encreaſe the Number of
Cuſtomers, and by Moderate Gain come
to equal their Heaps, who uſe all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
Means for impoſing on
thoſe, who come to Buy: And in caſe
it ſhould not, yet there would be the
Comfort of a Good Conſcience, which
with the Hopes of God's Bleſſing,
would make abundant Recompence for
whatever Advantage their Neighbors
have over them, and is the Fruit of their
Injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Another Injuſtice may be in the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
if he makes uſe of Falſe Weights
or Meaſures; for this is nothing leſs
than Cheating; and as God has declar'd
this to be an Abomination to him, ſo
thoſe, who make this their Gain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God's Wrath againſt them, and
muſt look from him the Puniſhment of
all the Injuſtice they have done their
Neighbor.</p>
               <p>Here muſt have place the Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and Compacts of Traders, who by
theſe undue Ways make a Scarcity
when there is none, and by either keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or getting all into their own Hands,
oblige thoſe that will Buy, to come to
whatever Extravagant Rates they are
pleas'd to ſet upon their Goods. This
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38470:24"/>
cannot be allow'd in any Trade, becauſe
there is Oppreſſion in it; but 'tis moſt
Criminal, when the Monopoly is in
things neceſſary for Life, as in Corn,
Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this is bringing Calamity
on the Public, and Starving the Poor:
'Tis that, which provokes the Curſes

               <p>ON the Part of the Buyer there may
be likewiſe Injuſtice: Firſt, If he
that undertakes to Sell, knowing not
the true Value of what he Offers to
Sale, the Buyer takes this Advantage,
and gives much below the real Value.
For tho' Tradeſmen are ſuppos'd to
know the Price of their Goods, and
there is no need of Scruple in the
Caſe; yet while Servants undertake to
Sell, they may be eaſily over-ſeen; as
likewiſe many others may be, in the
caſe of Offering to Sell what they do
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38470:24"/>
not well underſtand. And yet no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
ought to be made of ſuch Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or Over-ſight; becauſe every

Fair-dealing, to be thus Treated by
another, but would eſteem it Deceit or
Over-reaching.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If a Perſon obliges a Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
to Sell for loſs; as in caſe he be
in Debt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3+ letters">

Price. Likewiſe if a Perſon
knowing a Shopkeeper to be in Diſtreſs
for ready Money, preſſes him to Sell
with loſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If a Perſon pretends, he
has no want of ſuch Goods, knowing,
that no Body elſe will Buy them, that
ſo he may perſwade the Seller to part
with them with loſs. Infinit other
ways there are betwixt Buyer and Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
in which, by Diſſembling, Lying,
and other Artifices, they impoſe on each
other. But whatever they be, tho'
Authoriz'd by Cuſtom, and Univerſal in
Practice, they muſt all be Cenſur'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38470:25"/>
and Condemn'd by the Apoſtle's Rule,
as far as they have any thing of Fraud
or Over-reaching in them.</p>
               <p>And that Cuſtom muſt be here inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which is of Buying Stolen Goods.
For this is an Injuſtice equal to Theft, if
it be done with a Compact of taking off
the Hands of Thieves, whatever they
meet with belonging to their Trade.
And it cannot be excus'd, if they only
Buy, what is by accident Offer'd to be
Sold at their Shop. The Reaſon is,
Firſt, Becauſe ſuch Goods are not theirs,
who Offer them to Sale, and it is not
Juſt to Buy of thoſe, who cannot Sell.
Secondly, Becauſe by taking ſuch Goods
off their Hands, they encourage Thieves,
by making their Theft an Advantage
to them, and thus do Injury not only
to Private Perſons, but alſo to the
Government, in helping to ſupport
Robbers, by making their Wickedneſs
Serviceable to them. Thirdly, For
their own ſakes; becauſe, when they
have paid for ſuch Goods, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be eſteem'd their own, but theirs
from whom they were Stoln; and
whatever Advantage they make in Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſuch Goods again, it is not theirs,
but of Right belongs to the Owners,
from whom they were taken.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:38470:25"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But if Shopkeepers Buy ſuch Goods
with a good Conſcience, without Suſpicion of
their being Stoln?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There is ſomething ſo particular
in Thieves Offering Stoln Goods to
Sale, both in the way of Offering them,
and in the Under-rate, which they ask,
that it is eaſily diſcern'd by ſuch as are
us'd to Trade: But if we muſt ſuppoſe
your Caſe, I anſwer, that if Stoln
Goods are bought without Suſpicion
of their being Stoln, there can be no
Sin in ſuch a purchaſe, becauſe it was
made with a Good Conſcience, and
without any appearance of Evil. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
if afterwards there be Evidence
of the Goods having been Stoln, the
Purchaſer, tho' he has paid for them,
can make no Advantage of them, nor
Sell them, but they are to be return'd
to the Owner, who has the only Right
to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is not this hard, when he has paid
for them, and bought them with a Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is his Misfortune to be thus
impos'd on. He has been Cheated, and
muſt be a loſer by it, as he muſt be in all
other Bargains, where the Goods do not
anſwer his Expectation, but, upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
prove Damag'd, Imperfect
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38470:26"/>
or Counterfeit; for as here, he muſt
bear the loſs, except he can recover
ſomething of him that made the Sale;
ſo in the Caſe propos'd, the Purchaſer
of Stoln Goods muſt ſtand to the loſs,
except he can find a way to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of him, that Sold them; for
the Firſt Owner has all the Right to
them; his Title being ſtill as Good as
ever, notwithſtanding the Theft and
the Sale, that has been made of them.
Thus the Law decrees, and 'tis found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the trueſt Principles of Juſtice:
Becauſe no Man loſes his Right by the
Act of another, who has no Right for
what he does. It would be the ſame it
an Eſtate, which the Owner would
not loſe, tho' another ſhould have
paid the full Price of it, to one, who
had no Right to Sell it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what if the Purchaſer has Sold
the Goods again, before he has any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their having been Stoln?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Caſe is hard, but I muſt
judge as the Law does, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
no Diſtinction betwixt the Goods,
and the Price of the Goods, obliges in
both Caſes to Reſtitution. Thus, I
think, Conſcience obliges, ſince ſuch
a Perſon is in Poſſeſſion of what is not
his own upon a juſt Title; and I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38470:26"/>
know of no Relief, but from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to whom the Reſtitution is to
be made, who being aſſur'd of his Buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Selling ſuch Goods with a good
Conſcience, without any Suſpicion of
their being Stoln, ought in Equity to
conſider him, and not let him bear the
whole Loſs. This, I know, the Law
will not Encourage, becauſe it takes
no Cognizance of Conſcience, but only
of the Overt Act: But where Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is wholly conſider'd, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
muſt be different, and I ſee
none more Equitable, than what I have
here declar'd; for ſo, I think, Sincere
and Juſt Perſons would do on both
ſides. And hence, if there ſhould be
any, who, upon the Motive of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
after having thus Bought and Sold
Stoln Goods, ſhould make their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
to the Party from whom they
were Stoln, I think it would be Cruelty
to take the Advantage, which the
Law gives in ſuch Caſe, and Refuſe the
Compoſition here preſcrib'd; becauſe
Equity will not allow ſuch Rigor, but
requires Tenderneſs towards Perſons of
Tender Conſciences.</p>
               <p>Theſe Directions may ſerve for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
but having preſcrib'd Juſtice to
to be obſerv'd in the Manner of Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I cannot Conclude without this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38470:27"/>
Fundamental Caution, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Lawfulneſs of the Trade they
profeſs. The far greater part are ſo;
but ſome are to be queſtion'd, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the way, they are generally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd;
ſuch, I mean, which have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Poor, and Extortion in
them. Amongſt theſe I reckon Pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brokers,
and ſome Private Perſons, who
lend Money to ſuch as are in Diſtreſs.
There are many Reaſons abſolutely to
except againſt them; but certainly, as
the Common Practice is, of Doubling
the Principal, or gaining Fifty or Eighty
<hi>per Cent.</hi> they are ſo far from helping
the Poor, as they pretend, that they
Eat out their very Bowels, and Devour
them; and therefore, in this way, muſt
be Condemn'd of Oppreſſion. And if
they are any way to be juſtified, it
muſt be, by bringing them to ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation,
by having the whole Matter
laid before thoſe in Authority, and a
Moderate Gain ſettled, upon a due
Computation of their Expences, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
and Loſſes. If this were done,
they might be Serviceable to the Public,
and live by the Service they do to thoſe,
who want their Aſſiſtance; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this, I do not ſee, how any, who
pretend to Conſcience, can live in the
Profeſſion and Practice of ſo Evident
an Extortion.</p>

               <head>SECT. VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">In Workmen and Laborers.</head>
               <p>HAving gone thus far with Traders,
as to Buying and Selling, I muſt
now ſpeak to others, whoſe Profeſſion
is to ſerve their Neighbor, and take
Money as the Reward of their Labor,
whether of Mind or Body. And theſe
are to keep to the ſame Standard-Rule
with the former, of not over-reaching,
defrauding, wronging, or doing any
kind of Injuſtice to their Neighbor.</p>
               <p>There is Injuſtice in theſe, if they
exact more for their Labor, than what
is due according to the Common Rate,
which Cuſtom and Practice have ſet
upon it. But I ſpeak not here of thoſe,
whoſe particular Art, as in Painting,
Carving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be thus rated,
but muſt be differently Valued, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rarity of the Work.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they do not take due
Pains, that the Work they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
be done according to Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For if they either put not in
good Materials or Ingredients, or
ſlightly make up a Work, ſo as not to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38470:28"/>
anſwer the Contract, it is evident, they
over-reach their Neighbor, and take
Money for what they have not done;
ſince the Price of Slight Work is very
different from that, which is more
Subſtantial. In this are concern'd all
ſorts of Working Trades; and as it is
a Principal Part of Honeſty belonging
to their Profeſſion, to Finiſh their
Work according to Agreement, both
as to the Goodneſs of Materials, and
due Care in making it up; ſo it is an
evident Injuſtice to do otherwiſe, and
no Generality of Practice will excuſe
the guilt any more, than the Number
of Offenders does in other Sins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If by neglecting to Finiſh
their Work according to Agreement,
or in due time, they conſiderably injure
thoſe, who employ them. This may
be in many Caſes, and is moſt evident
in what belongs to Plowing, Planting
and Gardening, where Neglect proves
the loſs of the Seaſon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If the Materials or Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
are conſiderably prejudiced, and
the Work damag'd by their neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make it up in due time. This
happens in many Compounds, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Goodneſs and
Virtue depends often upon a Nicety.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:38470:28"/>
               <p>Fifthly, If they demand more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
than is neceſſary for the Work,
and keep what remains for themſelves.
This is a Method of many Working
Trades, but particularly of thoſe, who
make up Cloaths; but how to excuſe
it from Fraud, I cannot tell; ſince
being paid for their Work, they have
no Right to the leaſt part of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
that remain, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
keep them, without his Knowledge
and Permiſſion to whom they belong,
but by being Unjuſt to him. If any
thing be due for Time ſpent in Buying
for thoſe, who ſet them to Work, this
ought to be ſet down and conſider'd by
ſuch as employ them; for Time is valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to ſuch as Work for Bread; but
however, they ought not to be their
own Pay maſters, but deal fairly, and
let thoſe, who are to pay them, know
what they pay for.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If they do not Work the
the whole time, according to Contract.
In this are principally concern'd Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-men
and Day-laborers, who make
no Conſcience of Neglecting their
Buſineſs, and Idling away Hours, when
they have no Overſeer to oblige them
to more exactneſs. This is a Point too
eaſily paſs'd over without examining
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38470:29"/>
by thoſe, who are concern'd in it, and 'tis
nothing but <hi>not thinking</hi> can give them
any Peace of Conſcience; for certainly
there is as much Injuſtice in this, as in
Stealing, and for this they will be call'd
to an Account.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of all theſe Points is,
becauſe whoever Labors by Compact,
is Bound in Juſtice to comply with all
the Conditions of the Compact, both as
to Time and Manner of the Work;
and purpoſely, or by neglect to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any, cannot be done, but with
Injuſtice, if it turns to the prejudice or
loſs of him, with whom the Contract
was made.</p>

               <head type="sub">In Lawyers, Phyſicians, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons.</head>
               <p>THE ſame Judgment is to be made
of thoſe, who are of a more Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Profeſſion, but undertake Buſineſs by
a ſort of Virtual Contract, and expect
the Reward of their Induſtry or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor;
ſuch are All that belong to the
Law, Phyſic, or Surgery.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:38470:29"/>
               <p>Firſt then, 'tis an Injuſtice in any of
theſe mention'd, if they bring in Bills
of Charges, and either ſet down what is
unreaſonable for what they have done,
or add what they have never done.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they undertake the
Defence of a Cauſe, that is evidently
Unjuſt; or, for their own Gain, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Perſons to commence Litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Suits, to the Prejudice of both
Parties, or Ruin of either.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If they take no Pains to
underſtand the Cauſe, in which they
are to Plead. If they make Delays in
bringing on a Cauſe to a Hearing. If
they have been wanting either in duly
Soliciting, or Drawing up Breves; if
they have purpoſely put off a Cauſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit
ways there are, by which Men of
this Profeſſion, put their Clients to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
and repeated Charges, and at
other times make them great Sufferers
thro' their Neglect Cuſtom, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of others, may leſſen the Horror
of this Sin; but certainly it is ſo great,
that it cannot eaſily be equall'd, ſince
in raiſing themſelves upon their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
Misfortunes, and encreaſing their
Unhappineſs, that they may be Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by it, has ſo much of Hard-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in it, ſo much Cruelty, and is ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38470:30"/>
contrary to the Spirit of Charity, that,
I think, it cannot be practis'd, but by
renouncing the Goſpel, and all Right
to Life Eternal.</p>
               <p>The Caſe is much the ſame, when
Phyſicians, Surgeons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neglect
their Patients, or Prolong their Cure
for their own greater Advantage; for
this cannot be excus'd from Oppreſſion
and Cruelty; which is likewiſe their
Crime, when for making their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
another way, they preſcribe more
Medicines, or more Chargeable, than
the Caſe requires.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In all Profeſſors of the
Law, it is acting both againſt Law and
Goſpel, to take Fees of the Adverſe
Party to betray their Clients. The
like Injuſtice may be in thoſe, who ſit
on the Bench, if they take Bribes, if
they are prevail'd on by Paſſion in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring
or oppoſing either Party, or if
they take not due Care in diſcerning the
Juſtice of the Cauſe before them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There may be the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
in the Jury, upon the ſame
Heads; for if they give not due Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Cauſe, if they accept Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
or Money, if they are over-rul'd
by Paſſion or Party in the Verdict they
bring in, they betray the Truſt repos'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38470:30"/>
in them, and muſt anſwer to God for
whatever wrong they do their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
whether in Life, Eſtate or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The ſame guilt falls on all
thoſe, who are concern'd in Empan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelling
the Jury; for if they do not
nominate Perſons of known Integrity,
and ſuch as they think moſt Indifferent
to Both Parties; if they are Induſtrious
in putting thoſe on, whom they know
indiſpos'd by Paſſion or Intereſt for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Juſtice, or if they take Bribes for
doing ſo, they are Falſe to their Truſt,
and have all the Injuſtice to anſwer,
which is the Conſequence of whatever
unjuſt Verdict is brought in.</p>

               <head type="sub">In paying Wages or Hire.</head>
               <p>BEſides the Heads already mention'd,
there may be Injuſtice, as to the
Wages to be paid to ſuch as are Hir'd
to Work. Firſt, In abſolutely refuſing
to pay what is thus due. Secondly,
In unreaſonably changing the Wages
agreed upon, as <hi>Jacob</hi> complain'd of
<hi>Laban.</hi> Thirdly, In unreaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
of paying what is due, by which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38470:31"/>
ſuch as Work Hard, come to want the
Bread they have Work'd for, are forced
to run in Debt, and take up what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for Life at the Higheſt Rates,
and bring their Family into many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By oppreſſing Poor Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
obliging them to Work at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-rate,
or otherwiſe not to employ
them; this is a Force upon Perſons,
whoſe Bread is to come by their Work,
and therefore muſt be contented to take
a little rather than Starve by ſtanding
Idle. But in this may be great Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
whilſt their Works being Valued
at a High Rate by ſuch as employ them,
theſe grow Rich by the Sweat of the
Poor, without allowing them any
Tolerable proportion of what is gain'd
by their Labors.</p>
               <p>Here muſt have place a like Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Spiritual Affairs; as in a Caſe
much practis'd, of thoſe, who having
Rich Benefices, put in Vicars to bear
the whole Weight of the Duty, and
ſcarce allow them what is ſufficient for
a decent Subſiſtance: For ſince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Donations have been made, or
whatever Tenths are paid, are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the Service, that is to be
done the Flock, and for their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38470:31"/>
and Encouragement, who ſerve
it, the whole ſeems in Juſtice their
Right, who Labor in performing all
the Functions due to the Flock. Thus
it was certainly intended by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
and in the Firſt Inſtitution of
Tithes, and it was never deſir'd, theſe
Pious Proviſions ſhould be made the
ſupport of Idle Church-men, or to raiſe
their State, whilſt others for a Poor
allowance do their Work. This then
muſt be ſet down as an Abuſe, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Charities of Pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
But if it be conſider'd farther,
that ſuch Plentiful Benefices were at
Firſt deſign'd, that the Flock might be
provided with Able Men, and that theſe
might not only live decently themſelves,
but likewiſe have wherewith to give
relief to thoſe of the Pariſh whom they
ſhould find to be diſtreſs: This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
ſhews a double Injuſtice in
the preſent Method; Firſt, In their
Committing the Flock to the Care of
ſuch, whoſe want of Experience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
makes them unfit for the Charge, and thus
robbing them of that help, which they
want, and is their due. Secondly, In
either unprofitably Hoarding, or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
Spending, what ought to be the
Relief of thoſe Poor, whoſe Paſtors
they are.</p>

               <p>HERE again may come in ſtill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Injuſtices too much pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd;
as, Firſt, In Maſters, Governors,
Overſeers of Colledges, Hoſitals,
Alms-houſes. For all theſe being plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
founded, and the expreſs Intention
of the Founders and other Benefactors,
being to provide for ſuch, whoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
anſwer the Conditions by
them declar'd; all Governors, Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are bound in Juſtice, by
their Place, to preſent or admit no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but ſuch as come neareſt to the
Conditions preſcrib'd; and thus only
can they ſatisfie their Truſt, and anſwer
the End of the Founders. As often then,
as they are over-rul'd either by Private
Intereſt, Affection, or other Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in preferring Relations, Friends,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38470:32"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to others, whoſe Circumſtances
come nearer the deſign of the Founder,
they abuſe his Charity, and act againſt
Juſtice, and are Falſe to the Truſt they
have undertaken.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In all ſorts of Truſtees,
Guardians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if theſe are wanting
to their Truſt, and let thoſe, for
whom they have undertaken it, be
Sufferers thro their Neglect, in not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining,
how things are manag'd, or
not calling Stewards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
Or if they make their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Truſt, above what is
due, by turning to their own uſe what
belongs not to them, or by making
very unreaſonable Accounts, this is
acting againſt Juſtice, and no Man of
Integrity or Honeſty can do it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In Overſeers of the Poor,
Collectors and Church-wardens: For
if theſe make undue Diſtributions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
ſuch for Favor, into their
number, who are not in want, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
others thro' Paſſion, who are
in want: Or if they give in Falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
or turn to their own uſe what is
given to the Poor, or Spend any part of
it in Drink, Dinners, or Entertainments;
they ſo far Rob the Poor, and can have
no more Hopes of Mercy, without a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38470:33"/>
Sincere Repentance, and making Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
than they who commit Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
and Murther on the High-way;
nay, they are in ſo much worſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as God has undertaken the Cauſe
of the Poor, and declar'd, that he will
be the Revenger of thoſe, that do them
wrong.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In Maſters of Schools, or
others, who have the Care of Youth:
For if theſe have either a ſettled Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
or are paid by the Parents of thoſe,
who are under their Charge, they are
oblig'd in Juſtice, to take due Pains in
teaching ſuch Youth, and to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in every particular, as far as they
have undertaken, in order to their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And if they are either Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
or Careleſs in teaching them, or
for want of due Inſpection, give them
Opportunities of doing themſelves In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
by Idleneſs, or Ill converſation,
they betray their Truſt, and will have
all thoſe Miſchiefs to anſwer for,
which are the Conſequence of their
Neglect. And may not the Ruin of
many Families, and Loſs of many Souls,
be a part of this?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In thoſe, who having the
Money of others in their Hands, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to give them ſufficient Security:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38470:33"/>
For tho' thoſe to whom it belongs,
ought to preſs it, yet there are Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
where Baſhfulneſs, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance,
Friendſhip, will not allow
ſome. Tempers to be importune in the
Caſe; and here for the Debtor to omit
or delay the ſecuring ſuch Money, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be clear'd from Injuſtice, ſince
'tis hazarding another's Right, and may
eaſily prove his Ruin. Theſe Delays
have often been follow'd with ſuch
Effects, that neither Juſtice nor Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
can expoſe another's Right to ſuch
Uncertainties, as are thoſe of Life.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, In thoſe, who neglect to make
their laſt Will in time of Health, who
have Matters of Juſtice, Proviſion for
Younger Children, the Peace of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> depending on their Settlements.
The Injuſtice of Delays in this Point is
very evident, where Juſtice preſſes ſo
ſtrongly for it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In all thoſe, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily
Contract Debts, which may
be never in their Power to pay; and
in all thoſe, who, being able, Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
to ſatisfie Juſt Debts. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the former part is, becauſe doing
Juſtice ought not to be put to hazards
without Neceſſity. And the Reaſon
of the latter is, becaule paying Debts
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38470:34"/>
is a Point of Juſtice, and therefore
ought to be ſatisfied. This is moſt
preſſing in Regard of thoſe, who want
their Money; and the greater the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
are, which they Suffer
for want of it the greater is the Crime.
'Tis no leſs than Cruelty and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the denial of Juſt Debts
ſtreightens Families, ſo as to want Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for Managing their Trade,
Educating their Children, and brings
ruin upon them. 'Tis generally injurious
to all, becauſe there are few, but what
are Sufferers for want of their Money;
and ſometimes thoſe are the greateſt,
who ſeem leaſt Importune in Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own. At leaſt their Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
are not to be diſputed, who
ſolicite for their due; and therefore,
tho' it be no ſurprize, that Men of no
Principles Contract Debts on all ſides,
and are not concern'd in paying; yet
it is a matter of juſt wonder, that thoſe,
who ſeem ſerious in the Buſineſs of
Salvation, and make a Scruple of being
Unjuſt, ſhould be ſo little Solicitous
in Paying what they Owe, but let their
Debts run on, with no more Reflection,
than as if no Body were injur'd by
their Debts unpaid, or that it was not
their Duty to pay them. They ſeem
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38470:34"/>
to think little of it, and ſo are at Reſt
within themſelves; but to me their
Caſe looks ſo very ill, by Reaſon of the
many Injuries, they may do by their
Neglect; that in my Opinion, 'tis
much ſafer for them to conſider it in
time, than to run the hazard of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
which may be charg'd upon
them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In many Maſters of Families,
and Gentlemen of Eſtates. For when
I conſider theſe, upon the Title of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
bound to provide for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and Family, I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Neglect of this is doing
contrary to Juſtice, contrary to that
Duty, which God has laid upon them,
and they by a virtual Contract, have
undertaken. And what then muſt I
ſay of Tradeſmen or others, who live
by their Induſtry, when thro' Sloth or
Ill Company, they neglect their Buſineſs,
and expoſe their Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all
the Miſchiefs of Want? What of
Gentlemen, who either thro' want of
Care, or the Immoderate Expences of
an Idle, Extravagant or Vicious Life,
waſte their eſtates, and many ways In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure,
if not wholly Ruin their Family?
Can theſe think themſelves Juſt, I do
not ſay to God, but to Men, while
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38470:35"/>
they Prodigally throw away their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
of which, according to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Scheme, they are no more than
Principal Stewards, and ought to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
for the good of their Poſterity, to
whom whilſt they give a Being, they
ought likewiſe to provide a Well-being?
Can they think themſelves Juſt, while
to gratifie their Humors, their Vices
and Idle Company, they are more Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
to the Children of their own Bowels,
than the worſt of Enemies? I cannot
tell what their Thoughts may be, tho'
I fear they do not think; but to make
a Judgment from the Infinite Miſchiefs
I have ſeen brought upon Generations
by this unchriſtian Method, I think
the Violence of Thieves and Murtherers
may more likely find Mercy, than the
Treachery of theſe Modiſh Parricides.
And therefore, whatever their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be, to eſteem them for Chriſtians, is
what I cannot do, without Violence
to all the Principles I have learnt from
Chriſt and his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Infinite other Injuſtices there are, but
from the Conſideration of theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
I think they may be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
by thoſe, who are not reſolv'd
to ſmother all the Principles of Nature,
Reaſon and Faith, which God has given
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38470:35"/>
them; and therefore I conclude with
this Requeſt to all thoſe, who are any
ways engag'd in Money-concerns, that
they would be watchful againſt all the
Temptations of unjuſt Gain, and not
loſe their Souls for any Advantage that
can be expected from over-reaching or
defrauding their Neighbor; but to be
contented with the Fruit of Fair and
Juſt dealing, hoping for the Bleſſing of
God on it, and eſteeming a Little with
the Comfort of a Good Conſcience, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the Abundance of Fraud and
Injuſtice; for thus only can they Act
as Chriſtians.</p>
