            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>The Spaniard now conjectur'd his intent,</l>
                     <l>By seeking death t'avoid imprisonment,</l>
                     <l>And so forbore to shoot, drew neere and sought</l>

                     <l>She's down-right foundred, and can work no more.</l>
                     <l>Here might be seen the sad effects of feare</l>

                     <l>Bryan's all confidence and hastens thither</l>

The place design'd was hardly twelve yards square,</l>
                     <l>No traversing of ground, no boyes-play there,</l>
                     <l>The rest was bog, ore which some planks were laid</l>

                     <l>Their mettle is the whetstone of their swords.</l>
                     <l>They clap together like two sons of thunder,</l>
                     <l>Their blades struck lightning, whilst the earth quak'd under</l>

                     <l>Seemes to attend it, till both out of breath</l>
                     <l>Consent to make a stand, but this short rest</l>
                     <l>Was like a sallet with a muttons brest</l>
                     <l>To their sharp stomacks, to't they go again,</l>
                     <l>And lay on load like devils, not like men.</l>
                     <l>Their well-try'd arms do blush with their own blood,</l>
                     <l>To find their flesh in whose defence they stood,</l>
                     <l>Stand, whilst it fell: for that their keen swords whipt off</l>
                     <l>As if they would each other make a chipt loaf.</l>
                     <l>At last, as I have seen a man of war</l>
                     <l>Exalt a Carrick, which exceeds him far,</l>
                     <l>In bulk and strength: so <hi>Iones</hi> deales now with Bryan,</l>
                     <l>With shuns and shifts, more like a Fox than Lion.</l>
                     <l>For (to speak truly) this fell Pagan lout</l>
                     <l>Doth so belabour <hi>Jones</hi> from head to foot,</l>
                     <l>That both his eares doe oft with sorrow sing,</l>
                     <l>And's eyes see starres at noon (a wondrous thing)</l>
                     <l>We must conceive those furious blowes he dealt,</l>
                     <l>Were well repaid with use, which Bryan felt.</l>

But <hi>Iones</hi> esteeming it an equal thing</l>
                     <l>To be self-conquer'd, and long conquering,</l>
                     <l>Resolves to put the businesse out of doubt</l>
                     <l>With one Passe more, which was the fatall bour.</l>
                     <l>On this Resolve, with both his hands he prest</l>
                     <l>The pummel of his sword against his brest,</l>
                     <l>Then like a thunder-bolt tilts swiftly at him:</l>
                     <l>With th' fear of this, Bryan had quite forgot him.</l>
                     <l>That't was a bog behinde, so backward springs,</l>
                     <l>And his whole body up to th' arm-pits flings,</l>

                     <l>With which ore-born, our <hi>Jones</hi> so mawles his pate,</l>
                     <l>That th' helmet flies, and leaves his head to th' danger,</l>

                     <l>And now the day is his, his strength he straines</l>
                     <l>With hand and hilt to beat out Bryans brains:</l>
                     <l>Who cries out quarter, Man of Mars I yeild</l>
                     <l>My self and sword, the honour of the field.</l>
                     <l>And where the power rests, 'tis much better far</l>
                     <l>To give then take a life in chance of war.</l>
                     <l>This and the bog doth cool the wrath of <hi>Jones,</hi>
                     </l>

Command, Ile do't; here see him hither led</l>

                     <l>The joy was great, but short; 'twas quickly known,</l>
                     <l>This was but some impostor for Tyrone:</l>

                     <l>Made known, who him and his condition knew.</l>

                     <l>Himself, where he suppos'd the Rebell lay:</l>
                     <l>Who wisely rais'd his camp the day before,</l>

                     <l>At last he was encountred with a rout</l>
                     <l>Of ravening wolves, who fiercely all at once</l>
                     <l>Assail'd the back and face of manly <hi>Jones.</hi>

The first good blow he dealt took off a head,</l>

                     <l>The Queen can pardon, and inrich at once.</l>
                     <l>Be you but good, she can be gratious,</l>
                     <l>Your own experience can informe you thus.</l>
                     <l>Thus <hi>Jones</hi> possest his noble heart so far,</l>
                     <l>He is resolv'd to wave the chance of war;</l>
                     <l>Himselfe and house he yeelds unto the Queen,</l>
                     <l>And her cold mercy, which too soon was seen.</l>

This is the last great act I can relate,</l>
                     <l>Of his good service for the Queen and State:</l>
                     <l>Rewards fit for his worth there were prepar'd,</l>
                     <l>Which his high spirit past by without regard:</l>
                     <l>And his great Queen was seriously bent,</l>
                     <l>To put him in some place of government;</l>
                     <l>But Nature onely taught the man to fight,</l>
                     <l>And his rude Mother not to read and write.</l>
                     <l>Which was the chiefest cause that made him hate</l>
                     <l>To be imploy'd in mysteries of State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </l>
                     <l>Besides, he was not pleased that her Grace</l>
                     <l>Cut off this Noble man before his face,</l>
                     <l>Whom he brought in; it may be his owne lot,</l>
                     <l>With axe or cord for nought to goe to pot.</l>
                     <l>Thus ignorance, a discontented mind,</l>
                     <l>And worth ill weigh'd, doe make him fall behind</l>
                     <l>Occasions lock; which lost, he never more,</l>
                     <l>Though bred and breath'd on hills, shall get before.</l>
                     <l>Now time and bruises, and much losse of blood,</l>
                     <l>Had made <hi>Iones</hi> feel cold age was not so good</l>
                     <l>As fiery youth; he needs must find a fail</l>
                     <l>Of what he was: declin'd from top to tail.</l>
                     <l>Which made him wish he might put up his rest,</l>
                     <l>And breath his last in his own Countries brest.</l>
                     <l>And for this cause he went unto her Grace,</l>
                     <l>And begg'd of her a Muster-masters place,</l>
                     <l>In Wales, neere his first home: where he may spend</l>
                     <l>His later dayes in peace, and in it end:</l>
                     <l>And yet to leave behind his martiall art,</l>
                     <l>To Wale's posterity, before he part.</l>

This sute with speed and readinesse is granted,</l>
                     <l>And so to Wales our Muster-master's janted.</l>
                     <l>Here many years he spent in telling more,</l>
                     <l>Or lesse of those strange things he did before:</l>
                     <l>At last in his old age he growes so wilde,</l>
                     <l>He needs must marry, to beget a childe.</l>
                     <l>Which though he mist, the mastery he must have</l>

                     <l>He meditates thrice every day at least.</l>
                     <l>His only prayer was the Absolution</l>
                     <l>In our old Liturgy, with some confusion</l>
                     <l>Of short ejaculations in his bed,</l>
                     <l>For some old slips, and for the bloud he shed;</l>
