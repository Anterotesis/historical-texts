         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By theſe meanes, treaſons are conſpired, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are prepared, monies collected, euill minds v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, fires kindled within our owne bowels: to the whiche forraine flames will ſoone bee added to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume vs: the miniſters of theſe miſchiefes are crept vnto our Dioces, they haue peruerted manye, they haue reconciled many, and now of late in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie they haue trauelled much, I knowe they are not vnknowne to you, and that either their woordes or writings or both haue very much preuailed with you. As a gentleman I do fauour you, as a ſeduced man I doe pitty you, as a reconciled man (if ſuche a one you be) I muſt deteſt you, ſith thereby you haue abandoned the miſticall body of Chriſte, and haue
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13112:4"/>
ioyned your ſelfe to the miſchieuous body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. In that you came of curteſie to ſee me, I muſt thanke you, and am right ſorye my leiſure did not ſerue me to haue further ſpeches with you. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto me two Propoſitions, as the grounde-worke of your opinion, the one, that the principles of your doctrine, are grounded firmelie vpon the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, which antiquitie, vniuerſalitie, and conſent doe plainelie make manifeſt vnto you. The other, that the ſignes giuen of a true Church by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reformed religion, which are the ſincere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the worde, the right adminiſtration of the ſacraments, religious prayers &amp; holeſome diſcipline are no true ſignes of a true Church, but ſo to affirme them is an error in Logique, for that the Church is a ſigne of them, and not they of the Church. For your firſt propoſition that the errors thereof may better appeare, I will brieflie handle theſe 3. points.</p>
            <p>Firſt that neither the Catholike Church nor the doctrine, antiquity, vniuerſality, or conſent thereof can otherwiſe be knowne then by the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that ſundry principles of your religion are not at all grounded vpon the catholike Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the Romaine Church vpon the which your principles are grounded, is neither the Catholike Church, nor a ſounde member of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church.</p>
            <p>For your 2. propoſition, that the errors thereof may likewiſe be ſeene, I will in few words deale with <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſe three points.</p>
            <p>Firſt that of a particuler Church no better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be giuen, whether it be ſounde or vnſound or of two particuler Churches which is the ſounder, then by the worde and doctrine that they preach, by the ſacraments that they miniſter, by the praiers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13112:5"/>
that they vſe, and by the diſcipline that they exerciſe for where theſe are moſte purelieſt and perfectlieſt done, that Church is to be thought the pureſt and perfecteſt member of the Catholike Church. Where theſe are impureſt and corrupteſt, that Church is to be iudged the impureſt and corrupteſt member, &amp; where theſe are not at all, there is to bee accompted no viſible Church to be at all. Thus to affirme is an error in Logike but a truth in diuinitie:</p>
            <p>Secondly that of the truth of the doctrine, of the right adminiſtration of the ſacraments, of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and puritie of the praiers, of the godly exerciſe of the diſcipline in any Church, the onelye perfecte abſolute and true touchſtone is the holy ſcripture, which ought diligently to be read of all men.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie that for the true vnderſtanding of the Scripture in thoſe things that are neceſſarie, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the place, the conference of other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the proportion of the doctrine, the ſummary of our faith, and the holy Ghoſt working in our harts doe ſufficiently enable and enlighten vs.</p>
            <p>The holy Catholike Church wee define to bee the congregation, companie and ſocietie of all thoſe that haue beleeued in Chriſt from the beginning of the world to this preſent time, all that nowe beleeue in him, and all that from henceforth ſhall beleue in him to the end of the world. It is called <hi>Sancta</hi> holy becauſe it is ſanctified &amp; hallowed by the holy ghoſt it is called <hi>Catholica,</hi> catholike or vniuerſall, becauſe it conteyneth all ages, all places, al perſons that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: it is called <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> becauſe it is a calling out or euocation of people out of ignorance and error vnto the faith and knowledge of God. This Church is the miſticall body of Chriſt, who is the true and onely heade of it, which gouerneth it in omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13112:5"/>
and is ioyned vnto it in charitie. <hi>Saint Auguſtine vpon the</hi> 56. <hi>pſalme, confirmeth this our definition of the Church.</hi>

For the whole church conſiſteth of all the faithfull, for all the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full are members of Chriſt, hauing that head placed in the heauenly places, which gouerneth his bodye, though it be ſeparate from the ſight, it is adioyned in charitie.</p>
            <p>It is deuided into two parts the militant and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant: the triumphant already in bliſſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ineffable: the militant, hoping for the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and in the meane time vnder the banner of Chriſt Ieſus, warfaring heere on earth, againſt the world the fleſh and the Diuell.</p>
            <p>This church for antiquitie ſo auncient, for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo great, for eſtate ſo diuers, for ſituation ſo v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall, no mans age coulde ſerue to knowe, no mans knowledge were able to conceiue, no mans conceit were of ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy to comprehend, if the holy Scriptures, wherein the ſpirit of God hath deliuered theſe thinges for our inſtruction, were not extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

            <p>In them we are taught that the churche began in <hi>Adam,</hi> that the firſt Martyr was <hi>Abel,</hi> the firſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor <hi>Cain,</hi> that by the Breach of Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement mankinde fell into that miſerable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt eſtate that it was not able to performe that Law of perfect obedience and righteouſneſſe, that GOD had giuen and grauen in the hartes and mindes of men, by the accompliſhment whereof, they were to haue life, and by the impeachment whereof they were to haue death eternall: and that then GOD in his infinite goodneſſe and mercie graunted a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for vs in the promiſed ſeed, which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore mankinde, and treade down the ſerpents head which was the firſt preaching of the Goſpell, publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by God himſelfe, apprehended by faithe &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued by <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterward of God reiterated to the holye Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, by them imbraced and taught to their children and families, preached and foretolde by the Prophetes, ſhadowed out in the Lawe written, &amp; in the Leuitical ceremonies, performed in Chriſt, teſtified and publiſhed by the Apoſtles, confirmed with ſignes and miracles, beleeued of al nations, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned by the Deuill, perſecuted by the wicked in all ages, and yet continued to the end of the worlde, by Gods eſpeciall grace &amp; prouidence. Theſe things wee plainely ſee conteyned from the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to the laſt of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> which otherwiſe coulde neuer haue come to our knowledge. In them wee may ſee the beginning increaſing continuance and perpetuation of the church, the eſtate and condition of it in tyme paſt, at this preſent, &amp; in time to come: the doctrine deliuered by the holy Ghoſt to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, to the Prophets, to the Apoſtles: and the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13112:6"/>
faith imbraced by the children of God in all ages, there may we obſerue the antiquitie that yeeldeth to no nouelties, there may we ſee the vniuerſalitie, that giueth place to no ſchiſme or diuiſion, there may we finde that conſent that grounded in veritye is polluted with no error or iniquity. Therefore <hi>S. Auguſtine rightly iudgeth,</hi> that the catholike church is to be ſought in the Scriptures: his words are theſe: <hi>contra Petiliani Donat epiſt.</hi>

language made either impious or vnprofitable.</p>
            <p>The diſcipline which ſhould keep all things in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and frame in it, is altogether ſtained with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and couetouſneſſe: finally, it is a member ſo ful of corruption, ſo ſwolne with pride, and ſo enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed with ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it perſwadeth the world, that it is the body, and that all the reſt of the partes are but members of it, and that whatſoeuer parte is not like it, is corrupt: and carying vppon it the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Byſhop as a moſt peſtilent vlcer it ſaith, that is the head, to which all other partes muſt ſubmit and ſubiect themſelues,</p>

            <p>Examine in like ſort any other particuler church: Do it vprightly and ſincerely, and it ſhal make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto you whether it be a ſounde, or vnſounde member of the catholike church: and if vnſound, in what degree, proportion and meaſure it is ſo to bee iudged and accompted.</p>
            <p>Theſe therefore are perfect and pregnant ſayings which can neuer deceaue you, if the lampe of eternal light, Gods holy and heauenly worde beare any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite or authoritye with you: for by that ſhall you knowe whether the doctrine of any church be pure, or impure, whether the Sacraments be rightly or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe adminiſtred, whether the praiers be godlye and religiouſly, or Idolatrouſly and ſuperſtitiouſlye made and vſed: &amp; whether the diſcipline be ſincere and perfect, or diſorderly and corrupt: and in this we fall to the ſecond point that aunſwereth your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition.</p>
            <p>If the doctrine of any church is conformable to the doctrine of the <hi>Patriarkes, the Prophets, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> whoſe doctrine and documents the holye ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>If the Sacraments in any church bee miniſtred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their firſte inſtitution and vſe, which the holy ſcriptures doth declare, they are to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rightly and duely adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>If prayers in any church be vſed according to that forme, manner, purpoſe and intent that the godlye of all ages teſtified in the ſcriptures did vſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, they are to be reckoned godly, deuout and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</p>
            <p>If the diſcipline be according to the Law of God according to the direction of godly Magiſtrates, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the councel and commandements of the Apoſtles, and according to the vſe and practiſe of the pureſt churches: whereof the holy ſcriptures are true records vnto vs, we iuſtly may accompt it good and ſincere.</p>
            <p>Therefore hath God commaunded, and all good men commended the ſtudie, ſearch, reading &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the ſcriptures. In the 6. of <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> wee read: <hi>Sunto verba iſta in corde tuo, ea<expan>

            </p>
            <p>It is ſhewed that not onely ſtudy is to be vſed for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13112:16"/>
to learne the holy ſcriptures: But alſo wee ought to pray to God, and to craue day and night, that the lambe of the tribe of Iuda will come, that he taking in hand the booke ſealed, will vouchſafe to open it.

He hath alſo ten hornes &amp; ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crownes, his hornes ſignify his mighty force, power and violence: his crownes, his dignity, honor and authority in this wicked world: wherof he is called Prince and chiefe potentate of this darkenes.</p>

Of this tayle were the Scribes and Phariſyes, and other religious folke of the Iewes: of the ſame alſo are all ſuch as by falſe doctrine haue drawen any out of the firmament of Chriſtes church, that were once there placed as ſtars by baptiſme, and regeneration. Hereunto the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> doth allude, ſaying the falſe prophet is a verye tayle: but ſuch ſtarres were not fixed in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13112:19"/>
the firmament: therefore the dragons tayle had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the dragon stoode before the woman which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ady to be deliuered, to deuoure her childe when ſhe had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught it forth.

                  </p>
                  <p>This childe that the church brought foorth whom the Dragon ſought to deuoure, was Chriſt our Sauiour: againſt whom the Dragon ſtirred firſt <hi>Herode,</hi> then the chiefe of the Iewes, the Scribes, the Phareſies, the highe Prieſtes, laſtlye the whole multitude, to the ende to deuour this man childe, that the church had brought foorth to her euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting comforte, and to the Dragons eternall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>This was that childe whom <hi>Dauid</hi> by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of propheſie ſpeaketh of in the ſecond <hi>Pſalme. I will preach the law whereof the Lord hath ſayde vnto me, thou art my Sonne this day haue I begotten thee: deſire of me and I ſhall giue thee the heathen for thine inheritaunce and the vttermoſt partes of the earth for thy poſſeſsion: thou ſhalt bruſe them with a rodde of yron, and breake them in peeces like a potters veſſell.</hi>

                  <q>And her Sonne was taken vp vnto God, and to his throne.</q>
                  <p>Thus when the Dragon had ſpitte all his venome, had vſed all the deuiſes and ſubtilties of his ſeauen heads, al the force and violence of his ten hornes, all the authority &amp; dignity of his ſeuen crownes, finally when he had ſhewed al his ſpite, crueltye &amp; malice, he preuailed no whit at all, for the childe whiche hee perſecuted Chriſt Ieſus, aſcended into heauen,

                  <q>
                     <hi>7</hi> And there was fought a great battaile in heauen, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought.</q>
                  <p>Here is deſcribed a fight and great battayle, whereof the place and parties are ſpecially to bee conſidered: for the place it was in heauen, that is to ſay in the church, for the congregation of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers is termed heauen: euen as the companye of the vnfaithfull and vnbeleeuers is called the earth: ſo wee finde in the beginning of this chapter, that the Dragons tayle, that is to ſaye falſe teachers, tyrants, perſecutors, and ſuch like drewe the thyrde parte of the ſtarres of heauen, that is to ſaye a great number that were accompted belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and members of the church militant, and caſte them to the earth, that is, made them reprobates &amp; vnbeleeuers.

On the other ſide is the Dragon and his angelles: that is Sathan and his miniſters, which are tyrants, perſecutors, ſeducers, falſe prophetes, hypocrytes, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13112:21"/>
ſuch like, with death, ſinne, hell and damnation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>8</hi> But they preuailed not, neyther was their place found any more in heauen.</q>
                  <p>Here he declareth vnto vs the ſucceſſe of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, the victorie was <hi>Michaels,</hi> the dragon was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, driuen out of the church, and had no place in the hearts of the faithfull. Thus Chriſt vanquiſhed the Diuell, death, hell &amp; ſinne, in ſo much that none of theſe haue any power or authority, vpon his elect and choſen people.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>9</hi> And that great dragon was caſt out, euen that old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which is called the Diuell, and Sathan which deceaueth all the worlde, hee was euen cast into the earth, and his Angels were caſt out with him.</q>
                  <p>The dragon that is to ſay the Deuill beeing dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out of heauen, out of the Church, out of the heartes of the godlie was caſt into the earth, that is, into the reprobate, the vnbeleeuers, the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whoſe heartes are the temples of Sathan, whoſe ſences are groſe and earthlie, whoſe adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and religions are terreſtriall, whoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are altogeather fixed vpon earthlie and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges. And his Angels were caſt out with him: death, ſin, hell &amp; ſuch other the Dragons aſſociates, &amp; miniſters: as they haue no place with the faithful, ſo amongſt the vnbeleeuers &amp; reprobates, they haue their proper ſeate, and throne, being together with Sathan their leader caſt into the earth: that is to ſay, among the wicked and earthly people.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>10</hi> Then I heard a loude voyce ſaying: now is ſaluation in heauen, &amp; ſtrength, &amp; the kingdome of our God, &amp; the power of his Chriſt for the accuſer of our brethren is caſt downe, which accuſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before our God day &amp; night.</q>
                  <p>Here is laide before vs the reioyſing of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Citizens, for the felicitie, and happines, of the

church that by Chriſts death and paſsion had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and obtained the victory ouer the Diuell and his aungels. For <hi>Michaell</hi> ouercame the Dragon, Chriſt vanquiſhed the Diuell, ouerthrew his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion power and authoritie, and now raigneth only himſelfe, in moſt heauenly and triumphant ſorte in the hearts and mindes of the faithfull. So the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer is caſt downe that we may well ſay with <hi>S. Paule VVho ſhall accuſe the elect of God? It is God that iustifieth VVho is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt which died, yea which roſe againe: which is alſo on the right hand of GOD, which maketh interceſsion for vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So the accuſer of our brethren is caſt downe which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them before our God day and night.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <hi>11</hi> But they ouercame him by the bloud of the Lambe, and by the word of their testimony: and they loued not their liues vnto the death.</q>
The faithfull, the choſen and elect people of God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame the Diuell, but how? Not by their deſartes workes or merits, but by the bloode of the Lambe, and worde of their teſtimonie: that is to ſaye, by the death and paſsion of Chriſt: and by beleuing in him that raiſed our Lord Ieſus from the dead, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to deathe for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our iuſtification: the apprehenſion by faithe of this incomprehenſible benefite, which was the word of their teſtimony, by the blood of the Lambe doth ouercome the Diuell, conquer the world, vanquiſh the fleſh, ouerthrowe ſinne, death hell and all infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall powers, according to the ſaying of <hi>Saint Iohn This is the victory that ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the world eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our faith.</hi>
                     <q>And they loued not their liues vnto the death.</q>
That is to ſay, they moſt willingly ſuffered death for the truthes ſake and for their teſtimony, in reſpecte whereof they loued not their liues, but after the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13112:22"/>
counſell of our ſauiour, in the fourteenth of Luke, denied themſelues, tooke vp their croſſe and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, and hated their life in this worlde, to the end to keepe it to life euerlaſting.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>12</hi> Therefore reioice ye heauens, and ye that dwell in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. VVoe to the inhabitants of the earth, and of the ſea, for the Deuil is come down vnto you, which hath great wrath, knowing that he hath but a ſhort time.</q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>13</hi> And when the Dragon ſaw that he was caste into the earth, hee perſecuted the woman whiche had brought forth the man child.</q>
                  <p>When the Dragon that is to ſay the Deuil percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe to be vanquiſhed and ouercome, driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and expulſed out of the harts of the faithfull: caſte and throwen downe amongſt the vnbeleeuers, and reprobats, hee perſecuted the woman whiche had brought forth the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> child: he perſecuted the church the congregation of the faithfull, which to her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

                  <q>
                     <hi>14</hi> But vnto the woman were giuen the wings of a great eagle that ſhe might flie into the wilderneſſe, into her place: where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the preſence of the ſerpent.</q>
                  <p>The prouidence of God aſsiſted the Churche, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the malice of Sathan: The Church hauing her faith ſupported by the two teſtaments, as it were, by the two wings of a great eagle in this wilderneſſe of the world, did infinitly ſpread it ſelf by the outward preaching of the goſpel, and the inwarde operation of the holy Ghoſt. The time, times, and halfe a time that is to ſay a yeare, two yeeres, and halfe a yeare is the ſelfe ſame that we reade before, a thowſand two hundred and threeſcore daies, the which wee there reduced to 42. monethes, and expounded the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths by Sabaoths of yeares, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Daniel.</hi> It may alſo ſignifie both heere and in the place before, the whole time and troubles of the church militant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the birth of Chriſt, to the end of the world, reckoning for a time, 500. yeares, for times 1000. yeares, for half a time 250. yeares.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>15</hi> And the Serpent cast out of his mouth water after the woman, like a flood, that he might cauſe her to be caried away of the flood:</q>
                  <p>Sathan that curſed ſerpent abounding in malice againſt the church, caſt out of his mouthe water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the woman: that is ſtirred and procured ſundrie people, nations and gouernments (which heere are compriſed in the word water) to perſecut and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor to extinguiſhe the church.

That is to the end that he might cauſe her to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by perſecution: and as it were caried awaye by violence from the face of the earth. <q>
                        <hi>16</hi> But the earth holpe the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed vp the flood which the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon had caſt out of his mouth.</q> The church increaſed by perſecution dayly, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors died, the earth ſwallowed them vp in their graues: and as it were opened her mouth dailye for them: and they daily fell in. But the church remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, continued, and augmented euery day: and the blood of the Martirs became the ſeed of the church.

                  </p>
                  <p>That is to ſaye, the Deuill aſsigned him to bee his cheefe inſtrument in perſecuting the members of the church, thoſe that haue the teſtimony of Ieſus. And to that end aduanceth his power throne and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in this wicked world.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>3</hi> And I ſawe one of his heades (as it were) wounded to death, and his deadly wounde was healed, and all the world wondred at the beaſt.</q>
                  <p>Theſe heades ſeeme vnto me to haue three ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: two of them are laide downe by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, in the ſeauentienth chapter, where they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to bee mountaynes or hilles, as heretofore we haue taken them: and alſo kings or gouernors, as hereafter we ſhall ſhewe them. But in this place it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13112:24"/>
to bee taken neither for the one, nor for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but for a chiefe and principal parte, of the eſtat euen for Roome, and Italy it ſelfe. Which aſwell by the ciuill warres of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey, Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Anthony:</hi> as by the looſe and execrable gouernments <hi>of Claudius, Tiberius, Caius, Caligula, Claudius</hi> the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Germanicus, Nero</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Domitius,</hi> and <hi>Aulus Vitellius,</hi> was as it were wounded and that moſt greeuouſly. Which in the time of <hi>Flauius, Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſianus, Titus, Nerua, Traiane,</hi> and the Emperours ſucceding it recouered: whereby the deadlye wound was healed.</p>
                  <q>And all the world wondred at the beaſt.</q>
                  <p>Such was the might and maieſtie, the force and fortune of the Romaine Empire, that all men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and maruailed at it: had it in admiration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde and reuerence, as an eſtate moſt happye, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and in a manner diuine.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>4</hi> And they worſhipped the Dragon, which gaue power vnto the beast, and they worſhipped the beast, ſaying VVho is like vnto the beaſte? VVho is able to make warre with him.</q>
                  <p>By reaſon of the falſe religions and Idolatries of the Romaine Empire, the Dragon that is to ſaye, the Deuill, was worſhipped. And by reaſon of the might and puiſſance of the forſaid eſtate, it was of al nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons feared, and honored, inſomuch as they thought that none other was like vnto it: nor any able to make warre againſt it.</p>

<q>
                        <hi>6</hi> And he opened his mouth vnto blaſphemy againſt God to blaſpheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heauen.</q>
The blaſphemous ſpeeches and actions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Empire, being corrupted with all kinde of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and impietie, was bent firſt againſt the name of God, ſecondly againſt his tabernacle, thirdly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that dwell in heauen. Againſt the name of God, that is to ſay againſt the eſſence, maieſtye, worde and wiſedome of God: Whereas in ſteade of the creator, they honored creatures, in ſteade of one true God, they ſerued many falſe Idols, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored them in corporall rites and ceremonies: in ſteade of him that was to be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth: againſt his tabernacle, that is to ſay his church for of the church it is ſpoken, beholde the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God <hi>is with men, and he will dwel with them, and they ſhalle his people, and God himſelf ſhalbe their God with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againſt them that dwell in heauen, that is to ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

the members of the Church: for that wee are no more forrenners, and ſtrangers, but citizens wtih the Saintes, <hi>and of the houſhould of God.</hi> And therefore may be well termed dwellers in heauen. For that as the Apoſtle ſaieth in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes. In that we are members of the miſticall bodie of Chriſt, we are come to the mount Sion, and to the Citie of the liuing God: the caeleſtiall Hieruſalem, and to the companie of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Angels, and to the congregation of the first borne, which are written in heauen. And to God the iudge of all, and to the Spirites of iust and perfect men: and to Ieſus the Mediatour of the new Teſtament, &amp; to the bloud of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that ſpeaketh better thinges then that of Abel.</hi> Wherefore as in the former chapter, the Dragon, that is to ſaye the Diuell, perſecuted firſt the man childe, that is Chriſt Ieſus. Then the woman clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Sunne, which is the Church. And laſtlie the remnant of her ſeede which keepe the commaundementes of God, and haue the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Ieſus: that is to ſaye, the members of the church. So this principall inſtrument of the Deuill the Romaine Idolatrous Empire blaſphemeth, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayeth and perſecuteth, firſt the name of God: that is his worde and wiſedome Chriſt Ieſus. Secondlie his tabernacle, that is his church. Thirdly, thoſe that dwell in heauen: that is to ſay the faithfull, that are the members and ſeede of the church.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>7</hi> And it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him to make war with the ſaints, and to ouercome them: and power was giuen him ouer euerie kindred, and tongue and nation.</q>
                  <p>They that before were tearmed dwellers in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, are heere tearmed ſainctes, againſt whome this Romaine Empire hath made warre, rayſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and preuailed in all cruell tormentes and rigorous kindes of death, &amp; that not in one contrie

or prouince alone, but throughout all the worlde, for the authoritie therof and power did reach in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ouer euery kindred and tongue and nation.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>8</hi> Therefore all that dwell vppon the earth ſhall woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe him: whoſe names are not written in the booke of life of the lambe which was ſlaine from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde.</q>
                  <p>Such therefore as are not the elect of God, whoſe eyes are not illumined with his heauenly light, and whoſe mindes are not ſanctified with his holy ſpirit: whereby they may diſcerne trueth from falſehoode, but are whollie led with earthly conceites, worldly conſiderations, and terreſtriall appetites, and therin doe as it were dwel and inhabite, vnwilling any way to be weaned from it. They ſhall worſhippe, obey, reuerence, and followe in all Idolatrie, and naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this Romaine Empire: iudging it to bee the beſt way for their ſaftie, benefit and aduauncement, although in truth it worke their ruyne ouerthrowe, and euerlaſting deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>With good reaſon it is here required that men ſhould be attentiue: for here is declared the courſe of the iudgementes of God, whoſe diuine maieſtie not vnlike to the lawe of <hi>Talion,</hi> puniſheth men by that by the which they doe offende</p>

                  <p>Sith therefore this Romaine Empire by force and fraude, by power and pollicie hath wrought the ruyne, and ouerthrowe of manie: it is the

iudgement of God, that by force and fraude, by power and pollicie, manie ſhall worke the ruyne and ouerthrowe of it: how inſeparable and inſuperable ſoeuer it ſeeme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Sainctes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is that in the expectation heereof, there is matter giuen for the Sainctes to exerciſe their faith and patience. For it was not a matter ſo probable, but that faith was needefull: nor yet ſo quickely accompliſhed, but that patience was requiſite: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by little and little it was waſted and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For as the Popedome which here next is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, did by degrees increaſe: ſo did the Empire decay by the ſame meanes: that the dignitie of the one was aduanced, the authoritie of the other was diminiſhed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>11</hi> And I behelde an other beaſt comming vppe out of the earth, which had two hornes like the lambe, but he ſpake like the Dragon.</q>
                  <p>The former beaſt roſe out of the ſea, that is out of the waues of worldlie gouernementes, out of tumultes and tempeſts of people and nations: out of the which in time was produced and brought foorth the Romaine Empire. And <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> when he ſawe that viſion, ſtoode vpon the ſea ſande: that is entered into conſideration of worldlie gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, eſtates and dominions: whoſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are like vnto the ſande of the ſea, vppon the which there may be no ſure building: for that they are ſubiect to the variable tumultes of people and nations: as the ſand is to the raging waues and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſea. But this other beaſt commeth vp out of the earth: a place of more conſtancie of greater ſtabilitie, a place of fruitfulneſſe and fertility, which ought to yeelde a plentifull croppe to the Lorde of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13112:27"/>
the harueſt: who hath prepared for the pure wheate of his elect, the barnes of euerlaſting blyſſe. The earth heere therefore ſignifieth the church, out of the which the ſeconde beaſt commeth, which is the Popedome.</p>
                  <q>Which had two hornes like the lambe: but he ſpake like the Dragon.</q>
                  <p>That the Popes pretende the hornes of the lambe, that is the power and authoritie of Chriſte: aſwell touching his prieſthoode, as his principalitie, all chriſtendome can witneſſe: who knowe right well that as Chriſte is in trueth the chiefe Prince, and chiefe Prieſt of the faithfull: ſo for theſe manie yeares the Byſhoppes of Rome haue applyed theſe two hornes of the Lambe vnto themſelues. As concerning the Popes prieſthoode, <hi>Durandus</hi> one of his fauourites thus writeth: This is <hi>Melchiſedeth</hi> whoſe Prieſthoode is not comparable Vnto others, hee is the heade of all Byſhoppes: from whome they all growe, as members growe from the heade, and of whoſe fulneſſe they all receaue: as touching his Princehoode, thus writeth Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Fredericke:</hi> My ſeate is in the citie Rome: the Emperours ſeate is in <hi>Acon,</hi> in <hi>Arden</hi> (a foreſt of France) what ſoeuer, the Emperour hath, hee hath it of vs: as Pope <hi>Zacharias</hi> tranſlated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from Greece into Germanie: ſo may we againe tranſlate the ſame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Germaines to the Greeks. Beholde it is in our power to beſtowe the ſame vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we liſt. Therefore are we appointed of God ouer nations and kingdoms, to pull downe, to roote vp, to buylde and to plant againe, in reſpect of both theſe authorities, Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight at Rome in a great Iubilie, as it were in the face of the worlde went in publicke proceſſion, one day in his prieſtly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13112:27"/>
pontificalibus, and the next day in the robes Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, with a naked ſword carried before him, cauſing this ſentence to be proclaimed, <hi>ecce hic duo gladij</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde here are the two ſwordes. Thus this ſeconde beaſt hath two hornes, that is to ſay, prieſthood and princehood like the lambe, that is like Chriſt: but he ſpeaketh like the Dragon: that is like the Deuill: falſelye and corruptlye, ſubtillye and maliciouſlye, proudely and prophanely: ſuch is the ſpeach and doctrine: wherein he reſembleth the Dragon, who is a murtherer and a lyer from the beginning, and the father of lyes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>12</hi> And he did all that the firſte beaſt coulde do before him: and he cauſed the earth and them that dwell therin to worſhip that firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</q>
                  <p>The might, poyſons and authoritie of the Popedome, grewe to be ſuch that it was equall alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if not ſuperiour in power and dignitie to the olde Romaine Empire, in ſo much that it could do in commanding and gouerning the prouinces &amp; potentates of the world, as much and as throughlye as euer the old Romaine Empire in his greateſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and authority could do: and that <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13112:28"/>
was by the iudgement and decree of a counſel, as a ſounde point of doctrine eſtabliſhed in the myndes of men: no maruaile if the talleſt Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Libanus did ſhake for feare of the bramble, leaſt fyre ſhould come out from him and conſume them. From this point of doctrine that it was in the power of the Pope to depoſe the Emperour, another was inferred of no leſſe moment: that it was likewiſe in his power to make the Emperour: &amp; for that the ceremonie of impoſing the crowne vpon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours head belonged to the Pope. When they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their greatnes they altered this peece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to a point of ſoueraignety: interpreting the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the crowne, to bee the diſpoſing of the crowne: Therefore <hi>Innocentius</hi> the ſecond, vpon the coronation of <hi>Lotharius</hi> the Emperour, the yeare of our Lord 1133. cauſed the whole ſolemnity therof to be drawen in picture within his Pallace of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, with theſe verſes ſubſcribed.</p>

But to returne to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall excommunications, ſo wonderfull were they in operation, that by them <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour, by <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> the ſecond, was cut off both from the tribute, and from the obedience due vnto him in Italie. His ſubiectes there were made to rebel againſt him: two of his exarchats were ſlaine, and the thirde had his eyes pulled out.

Yet is it apparant to the eye, that ſith from the ſtampe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne cleargye, this counterfecte did proceede: they had hereby a good deſire, to make their Romayne Church, an Image, and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the olde Romayne Empire, which is the beaſt, that had the wounde of a ſworde, and did liue: neither did they onelye endeuour to reſemble it, in dignitie, authoritye, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of honor and maieſtie: but alſo in forme and manner of religion, which is not vnknowne in the olde Romaine Empire, to haue conſiſted in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitye of goddes: they hauing a god for euerye countrie, for euerye prouince, for euery Citye, for euery place, and for euery thing: and for theſe they had alters, and Idols, and ſacrifices, and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ceremonies, in theyr honour.

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:13112:38"/>The interpretation hereof is nothing difficult. The firſt which is <hi>Eccleſia Italica, ſeu Romana,</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Italian or Romaine church. The ſeconde expreſſeth his gouernement: that is, <hi>Pontifex maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> the cheife Byſhoppe, <hi>&amp; Summus Sacerdos,</hi> and higheſt prieſt, <hi>qui plenitudinem obtinet poteſtatis,</hi> who hath obtayned the fulneſſe of power: <hi>cui in ijs quae vult, eſt pro ratione voluntas,</hi> vnto whom in what him liſt, his will, ſtandeth for reaſon, as his Canoniſtes deliuer. And the thirde is a myſterie by them alſo in theſe wordes layde open, <hi>Dominus Deus Papa,</hi> the Lorde God the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Thus in this charecter of 666. wee ſee contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the countrie, the language, the pryde, the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, the doctrine, the gouernment, the function, the impiety, and the blaſphemie of Antichriſt, which are euerie of them ſpeciallie: and all of them onely appliable to the Byſhops of Rome.</p>
                  <p>It reſteth that we further conſider in what ſort it is tearmed the number of a man: for ſo it is layde downe in the text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is the number of a man, and his number is ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixtie ſixe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better vnderſtanding hereof, we are to obſerue two thinges. Firſt, the matter handled in theſe three chapters, the 12. 13. and 14. Secondly the methode vſed and obſerued therein: the matter is the eſtate of the church of God from the byrth of Chriſt, to the end of the world: the byrth of Chriſt, the comfort that the church thereby had: Chriſtes conqueſtes, by his paſsion: his glorious aſcention, the malice and endeuour of Sathan: firſt againſt Chriſt himſelfe, ſecondly againſt his church: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the members thereof, the perſecutions, and afflictions of the faithfull: the reſtauration
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13112:38"/>
of the trueth: the decaye of falſhoode, and laſtly the glorification of the godly, and condemnation of the wicked, at the finall iudgement. The methode is firſt a deſcription of the church of God, in the forme of a woman: out of whoſe wombe, Chriſt is borne. Sathan is deſcribed in the forme of a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon: ſeeking to deuour this childe, which the church had brought foorth. Thirdly the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt is declared: and the perſecutions rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the Churche, after Chriſtes aſcention. Fourthly Gods prouidence is layde downe, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing the vniuerſall church from ruyne: which was doone by three meanes: by the generall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing of the church: by the two Teſtamentes, which preſerued the trueth of the doctrine: and by the mortalitie of the perſecutors. Fiftly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans endeuours are manifeſted againſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church: when as hee ſawe that hee coulde not preuaile againſte the whole bodie, that hee might the more violentlye afflicte the members, hee vſeth principally two inſtrumentes: the firſt the Romaine Empire, the ſeconde the Popedome. The Romaine Empire is deſcribed in the forme of a beaſt moſt vglye, and cruell. The pryde and proceedinges thereof are layde downe: and alſo the decaye, which was wrought by another beaſt, that hadde two hornes like the Lambe: but ſpake like the Dragon. Which by the iuſt iudgement of God, partly by fraude, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by force inuaded the greatneſſe, and authoritie of the former, and ſo brought it to ruine, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſt is the Popedome, whoſe pride and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is likewiſe declared: and finally the fall thereof, which is wrought by the reſtauration of the puritie of the doctrine: by the woorde of God, and ſhall
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13112:39"/>
throughly be accompliſhed by Chriſtes comming in iudgement. And this is it that <hi>Saint Paule</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs,<note place="margin">Paul. <hi>2.</hi> Theſ. <hi>2.3.8.</hi>
                     </note> that the man of ſinne the ſonne of perdition, ſhall bee conſumed by the ſpirite of the Lordes mouth: and aboliſhed by the brightneſſe of his comming. Nowe the next verſe which is the firſt of the next chapter, beginneth to expreſſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the doctrine. Chriſt manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his Church in mount Sion, accompaned with thoſe whome the former perſecutions of the Romaine Empire and Popedome, had conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as martyres vnto him, and ſendeth an Angell with an euerlaſting Goſpell, to preach vnto them that dwell vppon the earth: to euerie nation, and kindred, and tongue and people: which verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then I looked and loe a Lambe ſtoode on mount Sion, &amp;c.</hi> Which intimateth this muche vnto vs: that when that man ſhall come whoſe name ſhall be ſixe hundred ſixtie and ſixe. If it be wittily accounted: that then Chriſt ſhall manifeſt himſelfe: that then the euerlaſting Goſpel ſhalbe preached to them that dwell vppon the earth: that then the puritie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhalbe reſtored: that then the will, and word of God,<note place="margin">Re. cap. <hi>14.</hi> verſ. <hi>7.8.</hi>
                     </note> ſhall be publiſhed: by the which <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, and the popedome bee waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe circumſtances do leade vs to <hi>Paulus tertius,</hi> whoſe name being well accompted, contayneth this number of ſixe hundred ſixtie ſixe, if wee alter the numerall letters to Arithmeticall figures, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con it thereafter, thus:</p>
                  <p>PAVLVS. III. 555 111.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:13112:39"/>For <hi>Paulus</hi> containeth three numerall letters. vz. VLV. the firſte V is 5. the L and V is 55. which layd downe arithmeticallye thus 555. is fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty and fiue: then III which in numerall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſignifieth the thid in arithmeticall account is one hundred and eleuen. And both theſe numbers, holde an equall proportion, as one, ten, a hundred, fiue, fifty, fiue hundred: which both ſummes being added together, do make vp a third number of the ſame proportion, which is 666.</p>
                  <p>In the time of this Pope, the Goſpell began to take roote: in many countries ſundry learned men, both by wordes and writinges, preaching and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing the ſinceritie and truth of the doctrine. For the ſuppreſsing wherof, in this Popes tyme the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent was aſſembled, and no practiſe omitted by confederacies, leagues, and complattes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the progreſſe of the truth, and to perſecute the profeſſors thereof: but ſo had Gods goodnes ordayned thinges, that now the riuer of Euphrates was dryed vp: that the way of the kinges of the Eaſt might be prepared, Euphrates the glory, &amp; ſtrength of Babylon: the power and authoritye of Rome, was ſo decayed, by the euil opinion, that many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and potentates iuſtly conceiued of it, that the way of the kinges of the Eaſt was thereby prepared.</p>
                  <p>So that as at the birth of Chriſt there came wyſe men out of the Eaſt vnto Hieruſalem to worſhippe him: falling downe before him, and preſentinge vnto him their giftes, of golde, incenſe, and myrhe. Euen ſo at the ſecond birth (as it were) of Chriſt by the reſtitution of the true doctrine, manye noble, wiſe and learned men (who by alluſion to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtorie) are tearmed kinges of the Eaſte: embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Goſpell, fell downe and worſhipped Chriſt,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13112:40"/>
and beſtowed the talents, of their power, learninge wiſedome, iudgement, and induſtrie, vnto his glorye and aduauncement of his truth.</p>
                  <p>In this Popes time the ſocietie of the Ieſuits, was conſtituted, and ordayned: hauing added to their vowes of ſingle lyfe and pouertie, the vowe of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to a chiefe head, and principall preſident, <hi>cui omnes in terris tanquam Chriſto parerent: cuius in verba iurarent, &amp; cuius ſibi nutum, &amp; voluntatem, instar diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni cuiuſdam oraculi ducerent.</hi> This gouernour was as it were their chiefe prophet: and they as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the prophets. To theſe three vowes, they ioyned a fourth: which is, that whether ſo euer the Biſhop of Rome ſhall pleaſe to ſend them: thether without any gayneſaying, without any rewarde, or allowance ſought towardes their iorney, they muſt immediately go. Whereupon this Pope enlarged their ſocietye with his priueledges, firſte to the number of threeſcore, and afterwardes vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their faithfull ſeruice vnto him, he made it ſans number.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ieſuites are the three or threeſcore or many folde ſpirites or frogges, that come out of the mouth of the Dragon, that is by the direction of the deuill, out of the mouth of the beaſt, that is by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pope, and out of the mouth of the falſe Prophet, that is by the direction of their prepoſite, or preſident: For they are the ſpirites of deuils, that is to ſay, deuilliſh voyde of all trueth and charitie, which worke miracles, by their hypocriſy illuſions and oſtentation of learning, and go to the kinges of the earth, and of the whole worlde, whether ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it pleaſeth the Pope to ſende them, to gather them to the battaile of the great day of god almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye: that is to moue them to the affliction, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13112:40"/>
of the true chriſtians: in the which they ſhall confederate, band, &amp; combine themſelues by theſe mens perſwaſions, but ſhall be deſtroyed, vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ouerthrowne, in the middeſt of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiuous enterpriſes, by the omnipotent power of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing declared by theſe premiſes how this miſticall number, is the number of a man whoſe number is 666. we will here impoſe an ende, to the interpretation of this thirtenth chapter: onelye ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this much, that <hi>Paulus tertius,</hi> in whoſe name this accompt, and number is contained, was a man, euen in his owne time charged, with extortion &amp; ſacriledge, with adulterie and inceſt, with murther and parricide: with negromancie and coniuration. The particularities whereof are plainely expreſſed, in the xxi. booke of <hi>Sleidans</hi> commentaries, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ende of the yeare 1549. whereby hee ſeemeth a man not vnmeete in whoſe name this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall number and periode of Papall proſperitye ſhould be accompliſhed.

Jf it ſhall better pleaſe any to take the earth in that place in the worſer part, then doth it ſignifie corruption, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, terreſtriall appetites, and earthly conceiptes of heauenly matters, and in whether ſoeuer part the worde be interpreted, the deſignation of the perſon there expreſſed is the ſame and receiueth no alteration.</p>

The ſeauen heades ſignified ſeauen Kinges, or ſoueraigne gouernours, that haue ruled, and borne chiefe authoritie within the citie of Rome.

is the eight ſoueraigne, gouernour of Rome, and is one of the ſeauen that is to ſaye, Romaine Emperour, This Pope Boniface the eight well declared, when as in a great Iubilie at Rome, he went one day in his pontificall attire, as Romaine Byſhoppe, and the next day in his robes Jmperiall as Romayne Emperour in the one he ſhewed himſelfe as the eight, in the other as one of the ſeauen.</p>
            <p>They that miſlike this interpretation will affirme that there were either fewer ſoueraigne gouernours of Rome or more if they ſaye there were fewer they will be conuinced by the auncient hiſtories of Rome by the which wee ſhall proue the firſt fiue ſo preciſely as the occaſion of their beginning, the time of their continuance, the cauſe of their ceaſing, the perticular perſons that gouerned in euerie of them ſhall manifeſtly appeare.

            <p>
               <hi>But after the line of</hi> Charles <hi>the great was extinguiſhed, which continued not aboue</hi> a hundred yeeres, a ſhorte time inreſpect of the former, the Popes attained the ſuffraintie of <hi>Rome</hi> both as Byſhoppes and Emperours, ſo became they the eight and one of the ſeauen, as <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight manifeſtlie declared.</p>
