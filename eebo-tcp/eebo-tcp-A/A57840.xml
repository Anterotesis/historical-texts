            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Master Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His great Affaire of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> concerns this Kingdome in Nature, in Honour, in Reason of State, in Religion.</p>
            <p>We all know, how neare in Bloud the Prince Elector is to his Majesty.</p>
            <p>Many of us here know, what solemn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station hath been made in this place, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> by which we are bound in Honour to pursue it with our best assistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104780:3"/>God hath so framed the Powers of man, and so ordered the course of things in this world, as that in all actions, right Reason, and true Religion may well hold, and goe a great way together.</p>
            <p>If we consider Religion according to reason of State, wee shall find, that Christendome divides it selfe into two sides, with the Pope, against the Pope. His Majesty is the greatest King of <hi>the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; and therefore fittest to be the Head of that Party, which will adde a greater Greatnesse to Him then can be gotten any other way.</p>
            <p>The meanes to it are, first, to preserve <hi>Religion</hi> sound and entire, within His own Kingdomes at home: next, to unite the Homogeniall parts of it, pieces of the same, together, by Alliances, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federations abroad.</p>
            <p>The good Effect of this <hi>Germane</hi> Match was lost by the ill Councels of those times; It will be an Honour to us to repaire it by better.</p>
            <p>The restoring of the Prince Elector to his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory and Dignity, will restore Religion there; will strengthen it; may increase it further in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>; which consideration is of a great and vast Consequence, proportionable to the greatnesse and vastnesse of that Countrey. It will likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh and comfort the needfull heart of that most Noble, Vertuous, and Magnanimously suffering Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> his Majesties sister, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse mother, who is ever to be highly and tenderly regarded by this House, by this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>This is a fit conjuncture of time to begin it in, whilst the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath so much to do of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104780:3"/>
his own, as he is not able to afford his usuall aids to the Emperour, which probably may induce the Emperour to abate of former resolutions.</p>
            <p>That which is now propounded, is onely a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, to expresse and declare our zeale and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the Cause, thereby to give it Countenance and Reputation in the present <hi>Dyet</hi> at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi> Reputation, in matters of State, doth many times prevaile, as much as Substance.</p>
            <p>His Majesties Father (of blessed memory) and Himselfe, have for many yeares mediated and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the successive Emperours, by all faire and amiable wayes. They have been deluded, they have been neglected. It behoves us, Master Speaker, to be <hi>Englishly</hi> sensible of the Injustice, of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my humble Motion is, That the House will be pleased, presently to name a select Committee, to compose a Declaration sutable to the Importance of the Cause.</p>

               <salute>Master Whitlock,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we may do the Prince Elector good, by our good word, I hope we shall not stick to afford it Him. A Word spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in due season, is worth more than Gold and Silver at another time.</p>
            <p>His Majestyes Embassadour is now at the <hi>Dyet</hi> at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> where the Emperour and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are by friendly Treaties endeavouring to make
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104780:4"/>
up the breaches of <hi>Germany.</hi> If this opportunity be omitted, His Highnesse affaires will be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly cast behind hand.</p>
            <p>It is true, That our Treatyes heretofore have not been prosperous; the reason hath been, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the unhappy distance between the King and his people, which brought a disvalue upon this Kingdome abroad. But now, when the world shall take notice of the good understanding between his Majesty and his Subjects, by an earnest and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Ioyning of the whole Parliament with his Majestyes Declaration, the Propositions comming from hence, will carry with them more weight, more Authority; which is the way to redeem our Engagement at an easy rate, to save those great Charges which some doe so much feare.</p>
            <p>If we should be backward in this great worke; we shall cancell the Obligations of Nature, of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of Reason, of State, of Religion, which binde us to it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, Master <hi>Whitlock,</hi> my humble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, That we may draw up a short round Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, to wait upon and affirme the Kings Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be still managed by advice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which will be safe for our selves, more powerfull and effectuall for the Prince Elector.</p>
