         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVLL SYR EDVVARD COOKE KNIGHT, His Maiesties Attorney generall:</head>
            <p>SYR, I had no sooner taken a sight of your last Booke, entituled: <hi>The fifth Part of Reportes</hi> (vvhich vvas some number of monethes after the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therof in England) but there entred vvith the reading, a certaine appetite of ansvvering the same, and this vpon different motiues, as vvell in regarde of your person and place, abilitie and other circumstances depending theron; as also of the subiect and argument it selfe, vvhich yovv handled, and manner held in handling therof, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he greatest preiudice, vvrong, and disgrace of Catholickes, and Catholicke religion that you could deuise.</p>
            <p>And first in your person and place, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered your facultie and profession of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lavves of our Realme, your long standing, and speciall preferment therin, your experience, and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t gathered thereby, your estimation and credit in the Common-vvealth, and your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, honour, and riches ensuing thervpon; all


<pb facs="tcp:14426:3"/>
vvhich drevv me to the greater consideration of your Booke, but principally your said profession of our <hi>Common temporall Municipall lawes,</hi> vvhich science aboue all other,  <note place="margin">A stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge attempt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religion by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Princes lawes in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> next to Diuinitie it selfe, doth confirme, and conuince vnto the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of an English-man, the truth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Roman religion. For so much as from our very first Christian Kings &amp; Queenes, vvhich must nedes be the origen, and beginning of all Christian common lavves in <hi>England,</hi> vnto the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, for the space of more then nyne hundred yeares, all our Princes and people being of one, and the selfe same Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Roman religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their lavves must needes be presumed to haue byn conforme to their sense and iudgment in that behalfe, and our lavvyers to the lavves: so as novv to see an English tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lavvyer to come forth, and impugne the said Catholicke religion, by the antiquity of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-lavves, throughout the tymes and raignes of the said Kings, in fauour of Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Caluinistes, or other professors not knovvne in those dayes, is as great a nouelty and vvonder, as to see a Philosopher brought vp in <hi>Aristotles</hi> schole, to impugne <hi>Aristotle</hi> by <hi>Aristotles</hi> learning, in fauour of <hi>Petrus Ramus,</hi> or any other such nevv aduersary, or lately borne Antagonist: Or as to behold an ancient Phisitian, trayned vp in <hi>Galens</hi>

            <p n="2">2.

in doctrine, to ioyne with the Apostles. And this is the leap they make from our age to the Apostles time.</p>
            <p n="16">16.

            <p n="17">17. Now it shall be sufficient onlie, for the argument of this Preface, concerning the weight, and importance of this Controuersie we haue with <hi>M.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14426:42"/>
aske him what great, and singular antiquity he findeth in our municipal laws, that so often he nameth them <hi>ancient,</hi> as though, they were eminent, and singular in that point of antiquitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other laws;  <note place="margin">Of the antiquity of our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipall lavves.</note> wheras I, for my part, finde noe memory of any of them extant, before the <hi>Conquest</hi> and no written statute law before the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> which was two hundred years after that againe, &amp; with him doth Iudge <hi>Rastall</hi> also begin his collection of laws and statutes, from <hi>Magna Charta</hi> downwards: which was made in the 9. yeare of the said <hi>King,</hi> and of Christ, one thowsand, two hundered &amp; sixteene; which is not yet ful foure hundred years gone. And yet did English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men liue in England before the <hi>Conquest,</hi> more then twyse as longe, vnder lawes, partly municipal, and partly Imperiall; to say nothing of the <hi>Britaines</hi> before them againe: And consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, I see not how we may bragge so much of antiquity in this point.</p>
               <p n="20">20. As for the <hi>excellency</hi> of our laws, I meane not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, any due commendation, as before I said, nor to stand heere to discusse, what commodities, and incommodities they haue, as al humane things that depend of the variable iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and likinge of men; yet cannot any indifferent, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionat man, but remember that, which all our writers do commonly note, that they were brought in principally by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> and a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and such a one as intended to bridle the <hi>English</hi> by that meanes, and to bring them vnder by those lawes;  <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities &amp; discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of our municipal lavves.</note> And what misery, calamity and exceeding thraldome, our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted nation passed in those dayes, vnder those lawes, and the insolent dominion of the <hi>Normans</hi>; let any man read <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> that liued in those dayes, and other English Historiographers that ensued soone after, as <hi>Malmesbury, Huntington, Houeden,</hi> and the like, and then will he pitty their case that first liued vnder them.</p>
               <p n="21">21. It is euident likewise by all testimony of our old histories, how frequent, and earnest reclaime was made by the people, and nobility to diuerse Kings after the <hi>Conquest,</hi> against these newer laws, for the restoring of such, as were in vse before the said <hi>Conquest,</hi> especially those of King <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>S. Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor, about which point oftentymes, there were no small tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults made, and yet now by vse, and tract of tyme, the mislike being asswaged, and wee taught to be still, yea and to kisse the rodde, wherwith then we were beaten; <hi>M.

<pb facs="tcp:14426:43"/>
needes haue vs, adore the same, and esteeme them not only for ancient, but excellent lawes also, wherin I meane not to loose tyme in stryuing with him, for that I do hasten to a more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conclusion.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Further then, he not being contented with these two most honorable Epithetons and Euloges of <hi>Antiquitie</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> passeth on to another superlatiue degree, saying, that <hi>they are not only the vndoubted patrimony, and birth-right, but also the most ancient and best inheritance, which the subiects of this Realme haue</hi>; wherof hee yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this reason, for that by them, <hi>they enioy, their life, liuings, and countrey in peace and saftie:</hi>

Will this <hi>patrimony</hi> of the law, make them rich? <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> and diuers of his fellowes, haue had a good <hi>patrimony,</hi> and <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce</hi> by them: but this is not euery mans case.</p>
               <p n="23">23. I confesse that the lawes of euery countrey, are a certeyne birth-right of all subiects that are borne therin; and if they bee good and equall, it is a publike benefit, but much more if they be well executed, by a iust Prince, which importeth more than writen lavves. For that he, as <hi>M. Attorney</hi> confesseth, is the soule of the law, that giueth life, who also without writen lawes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther municipall, or Imperiall, may administer iustice, by law of nature and nations, if he will. What speciall, or singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity then, is here shewed to issue out of the municipall lawes of England aboue others, that they should be called <hi>our ancient, &amp; best inheritance?</hi> Yea, as he addeth after, <hi>in matters of greatest Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> meaning therby our soule, &amp; saluation. Is not this an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lashing? is not this an egregious <hi>hyperbole?</hi> Do not subiects in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Italy, Spaine,</hi> and other places, enioy their goods in peace and quietnes, and their liues, and deare countreyes in saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as wel by their lawes Imperial, as we do, by our municipall Yes; and much more, if we will beleeue them, and their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedest, &amp; this vpon some attent consideration of euents, which dayly they heare, and reade, of many men both great, and small, to haue bin ouerthrowne, and condemned in our countrey, both in liues, &amp; liuinges, which they thinke by their Imperiall lawes were impossible. And one only circumstance of English tryall in life, and death (to omit the rest) doth leaue them astonished, to


<pb facs="tcp:14426:43"/>
witt, that be he neuer so great a man, yet for his life, and landes honour, &amp; posterity, he may not haue that allowed him, which in an action of fiue poundes renr, or lesse, he should obteyne; <note place="margin">The obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of externe lavvyers against di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse points of ours.</note> which is a learned lawyer, or aduocate to speake for him at the barre; but that all the Princes officers, and learned Counsell, shall plead against him, exaggerating matters to the vttermost; and he only suffered to speake for himself, and that in measure, who for lack of skill, or memory, or tyme to consider, or boldnes to speake, or talent to vtter well his meaninge, may there betray, and ouerthrow both himself, &amp; his whole posterity in his owne defence.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And finally, the last vpshot being of that dreadfull action, to commit the matter to a iury of vnlearned men, that must giue their verdicts openly; and by consequence, vpon the same causes before mentioned of error, feare, hope, or other passion (the Prince being alwayes on part interessed) may easily be led fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously to the prisoners condemnation. <note place="margin">Se also Syr Thomas Moore <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Vie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi>
                  </note> All which inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, being carefully prouided for, by course of other lawes do make forreine learned men to thinke, that ours are more defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, than we persuade our selues, and that it may easily be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that they were made indeed by a Conquerour. And I could haue byn glad, that <hi>M.

And yet, do we not deny, but that our English lawes, for the whole corpes, and dryft therof, are very commendable; especially where the spirit, and meaninge of the first founders is obserued by the followers: yet want there not, by graue mens iudgments, many considerable points that might be better recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and namely concerning the imperious, and dominant ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding of many lawyers, and their exorbitant gaines, which yet perhaps <hi>M.

he hath taken these peeces, against Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction; which after he hath set downe, I must needs saie, that it is litle to the purpose.

            <p>THE whole bulke of <hi>M. Attorneyes</hi> booke (such as it is) consisteth (as before hath byn noted) in the recitall of certayne lawes, or peeces of lawes, and therfore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him <hi>Reports</hi> or Relations of clauses, found in his Commonlawes, or Statutes that may seeme somwhat to sound against the absolute Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ecclesiasticall of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops and <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to the restraint therof vnder certayne Kings, and in certaine occasions; and to ascribe vnto the said Kings some Ecclesiasticall power, in those cases, as afterwards shalbe seene. Wherin first is to be considered, that which before hath been obserued, that he abandoning, as it were, the first head of proofes <hi>De Iure,</hi> flyeth only to the other <hi>De facto</hi> which alwayes holdeth not: for that all factes, doe not infer necessarily the right of equity and Iustice, as before hath been shewed. And secondly, if all the examples <hi>De facto</hi> were graunted, in the sense, as by him they are set downe; yet are they farr of from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his principall, as often afterwards vpon many particular occasions shalbe declared.

               <q>Thus goeth the <hi>Charter,</hi> which though <hi>M. Attorney</hi> thought not good to put in English, but to set downe both his pages in Latin; yet wee shall translate the same, for the better vnderstanding of all sortes of Readers. <hi>K. Kenulfus, &amp;c.</hi> by his letters parents with the Counsell, and consent of the Bishops and Councellours of his nation, did giue to the monasterie of <hi>Abindon</hi> in <hi>Barkshire,</hi> and to one <hi>Ruchinus</hi> Abbot of that monastery, a certaine portion of his land, to witt fifteen mansians, in a place called by the countreymen <hi>Culnam,</hi> with all profittes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, both great and small, appertaining therevnto. And that the foresaid <hi>Ruchinus, &amp;c.</hi> should bee quiet from all right of the Bishop for euer, so as the inhabitants of that place, shall not be depressed for the time to come by the yoke of any Bishop, or his officers, but that in all euents of thinges, and controuersies of causes, they shall be subiect to the decree of the Abbot of the said monasterie; so as, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus goeth the <hi>Charter,</hi> which if it were all graunted by vs, as it lyeth; yet is it far of (as you see) from inferring <hi>M. Attorneys</hi> conclusion, that <hi>K. Kenulfus</hi> was head of the Church, or had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power Ecclesiasticall. It might make it probable, that hee had some Iurisdiction in some particular case, but what or how much that was or whence hee had it, either of himself, or by delegation of another, to wit of the Popes or Cleargie that is not euident by the <hi>Charter.</hi>

                  </gap>
               </note> But let vs see, what <hi>M. Attorney</hi> can make of these words, for that lawyers commonly can make the most of matters to their aduauntage. First he will needs inforce out of his Charter, that this <hi>K. Kenulfus,</hi> tooke vpon him Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Iurisdiction; for thus hee writeth. <hi>By this it appeareth, that the King by this Charter, made in Parlament (for it appeareth to be made by the Councell, and consent of his Bishops, and Senatours of his kingdome, which were assembled in Parlament) did discharge and exempt the said Abbot from the Iurisdiction of the Bishop,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And by the same Charter did graunt to the same Abbot Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction vvithin his said Abbey: VVhich Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Iurisdiction being deriued from the Crowne, continued vntill the dissolution of the said Abbey in the raigne of K. Henry the</hi> 8. So hee.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In which words three things are affirmed by him, wherof


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14426:103"/>
I hould neuer a one to be certaine, and the last euidently false. For neither doth it appeare, by the words of the <hi>Charter,</hi> that the King did exempt the said <hi>Abbot</hi> from all Iurisdiction spirituall of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> but rather of some temporall interest or pretense that the Bishop of that Diocesse might haue, or pretend to haue in those daies. Nor doth he seeme to haue giuen Ecclesiasticall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction to the <hi>Abbot,</hi> but rather temporall concerning contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies that might arise about the lands of the lordship of <hi>Culnam,</hi> wherof he had made donation to the said monastery. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly howsoeuer this might bee, the third point and cheife con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is false, that he either gaue, or tooke away Iurisdiction by his owne power deriued from his temporall crowne (for this was impossible, as before in the second Chapter of this answere hath been shewed) but rather by some spirituall Iurisdiction, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him by some other higher Ecclesiasticall power, either of his Bishops gathered togeather in Parlament, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; or of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> himself: all which three points, wee shall breiflie here shew, and therby conclude that <hi>M. Attorney</hi> his inference, sett out with a <hi>Nota</hi> in the margent, is worth no note at all, but onlie of weaknes and impertinencie.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For first, to begin with the second, <note place="margin">The first pointe of <hi>M. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi> colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> it doth not appeare by the words of this <hi>Charter,</hi> that the King did graunte to the same Abbot Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, within his said <hi>Abbey</hi>; but only <hi>that in all euents, and discussions of causes or controuersies arising about the foresaid Lordship of Culnam,</hi> giuen vnto the said monasterie, <hi>the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants therof should stande to the Decree of the said Abbot, and not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Bishop of the Diocesse,</hi> who before, perhaps, pretended temporall Iurisdiction ouer them, or at least-wise ouer that Lordship of <hi>Culnam.</hi> And this coniecture is greatlie confirmed by a Canon of a Nationall Synod held in <hi>Hereford</hi> almost a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered yeares before this, vnder <hi>Theodorus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> the 24. of <hi>September. Anno Christi.</hi> 670. and related by <hi>S. Bede:</hi>

               <q>That all monasteries consecrated to God, noe Bishop hath authoritie to inquiet them, nor violentlie to take from them any thing of their goods; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherby appeareth that some Bishops in those daies did pretend also temporall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer monasteries and their goodes, which heer <hi>K.

And by this also the other point is confirmed, that it doth not appeare by the force of these words, that the Abbot was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all spirituall Iurisdiction of the Bishop by this <hi>Charter</hi> of the King (though otherwise by some priuiledge of the Pope I doubt not but he was, it being a thing common lightly to all Abbots) for he saith only: <hi>Abomni Episcopali Iure:</hi> from all right of the Bishop, and not Iurisdiction, which might be meant, as hath been said, of some temporall right pretended ouer that Lordship, and was found now not to be iust; or for that the said Bishop in Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or otherwise (for <hi>M. Attorney</hi> holdeth, that all this was done in Parlament) had renounced his temporall right therin, which before hee pretended to haue; or that the King made this declaration of the monasteries exemption (for he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth rather to haue declared what was done, or graunted, then to ordaine it himself) by force of the foresaid Synodicall Decree of the Ecclesiasticall Councell before mentioned.</p>

               </note>8. And truly, that the words of this <hi>Charter</hi> doe seeme rather to meane temporall, then spirituall Iurisdiction in this place (though I doubt not (as I said) but that they were exempted in the one, and in the other by the priuiledges of the Sea Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like accustomed in such cases) that which ensueth in the said Charter doth much confirme, to witt, <hi>that the Abbot should be quiet from the Bishops right, and that the inhabitants from thence-forward should not be depressed by the Yoke of the Bishops officers.</hi> Which importeth as much, as that they had byn vniustly disquietted &amp; depressed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the same noe way seeming fittly to agree to be spoken of Bishops Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, and consequently it is not improbable, that only temporall Iurisdiction is heere talked of: and so neither spirituall Iurisdiction taken from the Bishop, nor giuen to the <hi>Abbot</hi> by the King in his Charter.</p>

               </note>9. But howsoeuer this were, or may bee; most certaine it is, that <hi>M. Attorney</hi> his inference and conclusion, is manifestly false; to witt, <hi>that it vvas deriued from his Crowne.</hi> For albeit, it were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the meaning heere were of spirituall Iurisdiction: yet might the King haue that power, to giue the exemption which he did to the monastery, either from the Bishops gathered togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now in the Parlament, or before <hi>in Synod,</hi> as hath been said, renouncing all their Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therin: or he might haue it from the Pope, which is most likely, for that all such priuiledges, and exemptions were demaunded in those dayes at his hands, by


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14426:104"/>
Princes, and founders of pious workes. And the said Popes made ordinary graunts therof, (as in our dayes also they doe) and this is different sorte and manners: For that sometimes they graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same immediatly, as from themselues, sometimes they gaue comission to Princes to giue it in their names; and some other times they confirmed that which Princes had done before in this kinde vnder ratihabition, or future allowance, or rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Sea Apostolike.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And of all these three sorts, many examples might be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <note place="margin">Of diuers sortes of exemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Wherby we see, that a temporall King, and founder of a monastery or other pious worke, might giue priuiledges, either by commission, or vnder ratihabition as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been said.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The like examples we finde in the liues of King <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>S.

The King, who is the vicar of the highest King, is ordeined to this end, that he should rule, and gouerne the Kingdome, &amp; people of the land, and aboue all things the holy Church, &amp; that he defend the same from wrong-doers, and destroy and roote out workers of mischeif. Which words, supposing them to be truly allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as they lye, haue a plaine and easy interpretation, which is, that the King, as Gods minister (for so <hi>S. Paul</hi> called also the hea-Magistrate) must gouerne the Church, and Cleargie of his land in temporal matters; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> for that they are members also of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as before we shewed: In which respect they are

subiect to the sayd temporall Magistrate, and in that sense to be gouerned by him, though not in spirituall things.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And if <hi>M. Attorney</hi> will inferre, that because the King is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called <hi>Gods Vicar,</hi> he hath spirituall Iurisdiction; then may he as well inferre that the heathen Magistrate had spirituall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ouer Christians, for that <hi>S. Paul</hi> calleth him the minister of God, which is as much in effect as <hi>Vicar,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> for that the minister supplieth the maisters place. And thus you see that albeit we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit these words as heere they ly alleadged by <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> noe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage can be rightly inferred against vs by them. But I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to suspect some little fraud or shuffling to be vsed in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this peece of law, and therfore I intreate the Iudicious Reader, who is learned and hath the commodity to see the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals; that he will examine both this, and the former instance of <hi>K. Kenulfus,</hi> in the authors whence they are taken, for I haue them not by mee.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The reasons of suspicion are, first for that I see <hi>M. Attorney</hi> his translation in these few lines, not to be very exact, as it will appeare to him that examineth the same; and secondly for that I find this clause of <hi>S. Edwards</hi> law, differently alleaged heare by <hi>M. Attorney</hi> from that which is cited by <hi>Roger Houeden</hi> in the life of <hi>K. Henry</hi> the second, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rog. Houed. part</hi> 1. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t. al. in vit. Hen.</hi> 2.</note> as also from another allegation therof by <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> in his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioan. Fox in Act. &amp; Monument.</hi>
               </note> by all which may be gathered that the verbe <hi>regat</hi> is wrongly placed in <hi>M. Attorneys</hi> allegation, which being amended, and the said verbe placed before in his dew place, the sense is perfect; to witt, <hi>vt Rex regnum terrenum &amp; populum Domini regat, &amp; sanctam eius veneretur ecclesiam, &amp; ab iniuriosis defendat, &amp;c.</hi> that the King rule his earthly Kingdome, and the people of God, and reuerence and defend the holy Church. Thus (I say) ought the words to stand, to make good and congruons sense, and not as they are transposed, both by <hi>M. Attorney</hi> and <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> to make a blind sense: who yet agree not in their allegations therof, as in the places cited you may see.</p>
            <p n="19">19. And this our assertion (concerning the true sense &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the former clause) is confirmed yet further by the words of <hi>K. Edward</hi> immediatly following in the same law, omitted heere by <hi>M.

Church) the name of a King agreeth not to him; but he must leese that name, as testifieth Pope <hi>Iohn.</hi> So he. And the same <hi>K.

The second which is <hi>confirmation</hi> and giuing of iurisdiction, <note place="margin">Election confirme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Bishop by vvhomel</note> must only proceed from him that is the fountaine of all spirituall iurisdiction vnder Christ (which is the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) or some <hi>Metropolitan</hi> or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop vnder him, that hath authority and commission from him. The third which is <hi>consecration,</hi> must be done according to the Canon-law, by three Bishops at the least. And by this also may wee vnderstand, what is necessary for the appropriating or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of any lower Benefice with Cure to an ordinary Priest, to wit, the two first, <hi>election</hi> or <hi>presentation,</hi> which may be done by


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14426:142"/>
a secular man and <hi>confirmation</hi> or <hi>inuestiture,</hi> which allwayes must come, as hath byn said, either from the Sea Apostolicke, or some Bishop authorized vnder him; for that it giueth spirituall power and iurisdiction ouer soules, which no man can doe, but he that hath it in himself, &amp; no man can haue it, but he that receaued it from those that had it immediatly from Christ, to wit <hi>S.

And yet further it is to be noted, for more cleernes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, that the first of these three to wit <hi>Election,</hi> is of foure distinct sortes in the Canon-law.

But the legate &amp; Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> were of opinion, that first the violence of the fact should be remedied, and then the matter tried according to the said Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons: which the King refusing to doe, the two Bishops interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi> whervnto the King answered by his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney <hi>Albericus</hi> in these words:
<q>For as much as some of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had vsed threats, and were preparing to send some to <hi>Rome</hi> against the King; in this (said he) the King doth commend them for their appealinge:</q>
but yet he would haue them know, that if any went against his will, <note place="margin">K. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to Rome but doubteth the same.</note> and against the honour of the Realme, his returne home should be harder then perhaps he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. Nay moreouer the King shewing himself greiued in this cause, did of his owne free-will and motion, appeale for himself to <hi>Rome.</hi> Which when the King, partly praising their appeale, &amp; partely threatning (as you se) had vttered, all men vnderstood whitherto it tended, to wit that they should not carry the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Rome</hi> at all, but end it at home.</p>
               <p n="33">33. This was the euent of that Councell; which I haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted somewhat more largely out of the writing of an eye-witnes, for that it expresseth manifestly what was then held and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for truth in our controuersie. For that <hi>K.

                  </note> And surely if our <hi>Attorney</hi> and that Attorney should haue disputed about the plea that was to be held therin, they would greatly haue differed; &amp; yet was that Attorney <hi>in Causaruns varietate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatus</hi> (saith <hi>Malmesbury</hi>) much exercised in all variety of causes: but his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, learninge, &amp; beleife, was different from that of ours, though he were foure hundred years elder.

<q>He sware also, that he would neither let, nor permit to be letted, any Appellations to be made in his Kingdome, to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in Ecclesiasticall causes, with this condition, that if any that doe appeale be suspected to the King, they should giue security, that they would not seeke, or procure any hurte to him or his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</q>

               <p n="27">27.

All which maketh for vs, shewing that the King would haue the subordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two Courts to be obserued, and the spirituall to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the temporall, where any one thing might belonge vnto them both. As for example, if any man were impeached of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy, &amp; thervpon his inheritance were claimed by another, the Ecclesiasticall Court was first to giue sentence of the marriage, whether it were lawfull, or no; &amp; then according to that sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral Court to giue possession, or not, of the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</p>

                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:14426:180"/>29. And that this was the true sincere meaning of the law at that time, intending therby to shew the excellency and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the Bishops spirituall Courts, aboue the Kings tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; is plaine and euident by an other Statute of this maner (which <hi>M.

And by this we may see how carefull the auncient lawes were to haue the spirituall Courte, as the superiour, well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med according to the law of Holy Church; and how not only ordinary Iudges, but the Chauncellour of <hi>England</hi> himself, &amp; his highest Court of Chauncery was appointed to serue vnto this: <note place="margin">Spirituall co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</note> for that of the spirituall Courts iudgement, depended in all such causes, the iudgement of the temporall Courts. And by this you will se also, the vaine sleight of <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> in telling vs, that the King did euer write vnto the Bishop of that Diocesse, <hi>as mediate officer and minister to his Courte, to certifie the loyaltie of marriage, &amp;c.</hi> For where doth he find in any ancient law at all, those words (<hi>as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate officer and minister to his Courte</hi>) &amp; in the latine, himself leaueth out the words, <hi>to his Courte</hi>; though in calling the Bishop mediate <hi>officer, or minister,</hi> which is as much to say, as superior officer, (for that in mediation and subordination of officers, and ministers that gouerne, the mediate hath the higher roome, in respect of the people and Court wherof he is officer) he includeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction against himselfe, for then is the said Bishop also aboue all immediate temporall Iudges, that must giue him certificate (wherof the Chauncellour we se is one) euen in the Kings tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Courts themselues.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. But the inference is much more subtile, when <hi>M. Attorney</hi> saith:
<q>All which doe apparantly proue, that those Ecclesiasticall Courts, were vnder the Kings iurisdiction and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement.</q>
But M. Attorney must


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14426:180"/>
not so huddle vp <hi>iurisdiction</hi> and <hi>commaundement,</hi> for that no man will deny, but that all sortes of persons (as before hath byn said) are vnder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, &amp; gouernement of the temporall Prince, whom he may commaund, ech one to doe their office &amp; duty in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth. And so may he appoint Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Courts, to notifie their sentences, iudgements, &amp; proceedings to his Courts, &amp; his Courts to informe the Ecclesiastical Courts, for good &amp; mutuall correspondence between them both, which we graunt also to be necessary in euery Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. But <hi>iurisdiction,</hi> which <hi>M. Attorney</hi> craftely confoundeth heer and shuffleth vp with <hi>commaundement,</hi> is a far different thing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a higher authority in the same kinde: as if the temporall Prince haue iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall vpon Bishops and their spirituall Courtes; <note place="margin">Hovv spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Courtes are the Kings courtes.</note> then doth it follow that all their power in spirituall matters is subordinate to him, and deriued from him; and so were there no necessity of this distinction, and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of spirituall and temporall Courts. For that the Prince hauing both powers in himself, might giue the same vnto any temporal Iudge to decide Ecclesiastical matters also in his Court: which yet <hi>M. Attorney</hi> doth often deny, that the Common-lawes can take <hi>conusaunce</hi> of such affaires. And surely it is worth no lesse then laughter, to heare him repeat so often <hi>The Kings Ecclesiasticall Courte,</hi> as though this were sufficient to proue the Kings Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall authority in those Courts, for that all Courts are the Kings Courts, in that they are vnder his protection, gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and direction, and to the vse, and profit of his people. And so were also the Ecclesiasticall Courts of King <hi>Henry</hi> the third in this sense, who yet chalenged no spirituall authority therin, as by our whole former discourse you haue seen.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. But now let vs contemplate a little the last conclusion of <hi>M. Attorney</hi> vpon this narration.
<q>Now to commaund <hi>(saith he)</hi> and to be obayed, belongeth to soueraigne and supreme gouernement:</q>
which we deny not in the sense, wherin it may be true; that is, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and to be obaied in temporall matters, belongeth to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty in that kinde; and to commaund, <note place="margin">M. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hovv it holdeth and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not.</note> and be obaied in spirituall matters, belongeth to soueraignty in those affaires: wherof you haue heard many examples, concerning the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> before alleadged. But for the King, and his temporall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers <hi>to demaund a certificate from the Bishops Court</hi> (for the Statute vsed not the word, <hi>of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding or obaying</hi>) <hi>to let them know thereby, what


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:14426:181"/>
the Bishops sentence and iudgement is, to the end they may frame theirs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly</hi>; this by M. Attorneys leaue is no commaunding in the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction it self of spirituall affaires; and consequently inferreth no Ecclesiasticall soueraignty. And if he be not satisfied by that which we haue already alleadged, out of the raigne of <hi>K. Henry</hi> the third, of spirituall soueraignty acknowledged by him, and all his Realme in the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> but would see further some examples in particular of the same soueraignty, or superiority at least, vsed and practised by the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> towards the King himself and Realme in that kind; let him consider these examples following besides the former.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. When <hi>K. Henry</hi> the third vpon the 16. yeare of his raigne falling out with <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> that had byn his great fauourite, &amp; high Iusticer for many former years, cast him into prison, and he escaping, fled to a certaine Chappel for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, <note place="margin">Diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing M.

And what followed of this? Did the King deny his authority? or say that he was not vnder his iurisdiction? or that himself had supreme authority and iurisdiction ouer the Bishop in that case? (as he might haue done according to M. Attorneys assertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) No: For the words of <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> immediately following, are these: <note place="margin">

                  <p n="41">41. For better vnderstanding wherof, wee must note, that wheras by the auncient Ciuill-law, great respect was had euer to children, borne out of wedlocke, if marriage afterward did ensue, notwithstanding they held marriage but only for a Ciuill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tract: so afterward when Christian Emperours came to beare sway, more indulgence and fauour was shewed therin; as may appeer by the Constitutions, both of <hi>Constantine</hi> the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperour, and <hi>Zeno</hi> that ensued him, and more yet by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian,</hi>

<q>Tanta est vis matrimonij, vt qui anteà sunt geniti, post contractum matrimonium legitimi habeantur.</q>
So great is the force of matrimony <hi>(held for a Sacrament among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians)</hi> as it maketh such to be legitimate after it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracted, who were illegitimate before. But yet this is with some restrictions: as for example, that they must be borne, <hi>ex soluto &amp; soluta:</hi> that is to say both the father, &amp; mother must be vnmarried at the time when the said children are begotten. For if either of them were married at that time, then this priuiledge holdeth not, as  <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p n="42">42.

Wee considering that it belongeth to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and not to the Church to iudge of such posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as depend of legitimation; we commaund your brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, that leauing the iudgment of the said possessions to the King and his Courts, you examine onlie the principall cause, concerning the loialtie of the marriage it self, and determine the same.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Heerby then wee see first, that <hi>M. Attorney</hi> alleadging this instance, hath alleadged nothing at all against vs, or for himself. For that when the Earls and Barons refused to change the laws of <hi>England,</hi> concerning inheritance vpon legitimation, they said no more, then is allowed them by the Canon-law it self, as you haue heard. And how will <hi>M. Attorney</hi> inferre of this, that <hi>K.

But this is not sincerely related: For the Canon-law, as you haue heard, putteth diuers restrictions, both in the persons to be legitimated, and in the ends and effects, whervnto they are legitimated; as also concerning the Countries &amp; Kingdomes, wherin they are legitimated. Of all which variety of circumstances and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations <hi>M. Attorney</hi> saying nothing, his intention therin may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be ghessed at.

Attorney) <hi>by iudgement of the Common-law, he lost the landes of his whole Bishopricke</hi>; But here I would aske <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> what high contempt could this be <hi>against the King, his crowne, and dignity,</hi> if the Archbishop pleaded that he could not doe it, eyther in right, or in power? Not in right, for that nothing was more receaued at that tyme in <hi>England,</hi> then for the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to prouide cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne benefices in <hi>England,</hi> and not only benefices, but also Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks, and Archbishopricks, as before in the life of this King, and his ancestours hath byn declared. And as for power, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile if the Archbishop durst not vse violence in those dayes, against the Popes prouisions, wherby he might incurre excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; for so much as the King himself so greatly respected the same, and made such diligent premunition, least my such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication should come against him, as in the answere to the former instance hath byn declared.</p>
                  <p n="17">17.

And still I must demaund what is this Common-law? by whome was it made? how came it in? where is it founded, either in reason, vse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the people, or authority of law-giuers? For if it consist in none of these, but only in the particular will and iudgement of

the Prince himself, neuer so passionate, and in the approbation &amp; execution of these Sages, which here <hi>M.

                  <p n="30">30. And as for the other example alleadged heere by <hi>M.

But if he meane the other offence againe after this, when he accused the said Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>VVinchelsey</hi> to the Pope, and caused him to be called to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to be suspended from his office, as before we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: then doth this case make directly against <hi>M.

                  <p n="31">31. About this instance, taken out of a Statute made in the 4. yeare of <hi>K. Edward</hi> the first, it is first to be noted: that albeit, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made heere only of the late constitution of the Councell of <hi>Lyons</hi> vnder Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the tenth concerning <hi>Bigamies,</hi> or those that are twise married; yet is the thing it self of more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity in the Catholicke Church, as may appeare throughout the whole title <hi>De Bigamis non ordinandis,</hi> in the first booke of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretalls, <note place="margin">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:14426:193"/>
coming forth, presently there arose a doubt in <hi>England,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such Bigamies, as had borne that attyre, and tonsure before that tyme, and were now in present necessity, to vse the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Clergy, <note place="margin">The true state of the case and doubt risen in England.</note> for deliuering themselues out of the secular iustice hand, ought to haue the same or no; for that it might be presumed, that the Councell meant only of these Bigamyes, that should beare the habit afterward. Vnto which opinion, as to the more pious and pittifull, the Bishops inclining, demaunded to haue deliuered vnto them, as Clerkes, all such fellons, as had bin Clerkes or taken for Clerkes before the Councell. But the King, and his Counsell were of an other opinion, to wit, that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> his decision was in generall tearmes, and excepted none, neyther before, nor after, and thereby vnderstood and meant to exclude all.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. This is the case, and this is the decision thereof. And now let the discreet Reader iudge, whether this example maketh more for <hi>M. Attorneys</hi> purpose, or against him; for that here the King &amp; his Counsell doe stand more strictly to the obseruaunce of the Popes decree as it lyeth, then those Bishops themselues, (who would haue had these Bigamyes deliuered vnto them as Clerkes) and therefore vrge to haue it punctually and exactly obserued. And for that men of reason might meruaile, why <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> a man of such accompt in the law, hath brought in such an instance, so impertinent to his purpose, he seeketh to remedy the matter, by this note in the margent: <hi>Obserue</hi> (saith he) <hi>how the King by the aduise of his Counsell, expounded how the said Councell of Lyon should be vnderstood, and in what sense it should be receaued, and allowed heere.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A poore commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and shifte of M. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> And why is all this diligent commentary thinke you? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth to the end, that you may imagine, that the King and his Counsell tooke themselues to be aboue the Pope, and generall Councell of <hi>Lyons,</hi> for that they tooke vpon them to expound, &amp; admit the said Councells decree. By which argument <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> may proue also, that Archbishop <hi>Peckam</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> calling a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod (as before you haue heard) of his Bishops Suffragans, and other Prelates, for receauing, publishing, and obseruing the said decrees of the same Pope and Councell, the very next yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was held, did thinke themselues to be aboue the said Pope and Councell, and to haue authority ouer them, for that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, allowed, and expounded the same decrees. And doth not euery man see the folly of this kind of reasoning?</p>
                  <p n="34">
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:14426:193"/>34. And yet you must note further, that for better bringing in of this argument, <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> straineth the text extremely in three or foure things, to make place for this his note. For whereas in the latin text of the Statute (for <hi>K. Edward</hi> the first put forth in latin, and so is it extant vntill this day) it is said: <hi>Quidam Praelati s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>quam Clericos exigerunt sibi liberandos, &amp;c.</hi> Certaine Prelates did require, or exact, to haue such Bigamies deliuered freely vnto them as Clerkes, which were made Bigannies before the said constitution; <hi>M. Attorney</hi> saith: <hi>Certaine Prelates haue prayed to haue them deliuered</hi>: whereas betwene <hi>exigere</hi> and <hi>rogare,</hi> to exacte, and pray, is a great difference in this case.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. And againe where it is written in latin: <hi>Concordatum est &amp; declaratum, coram Rege &amp; Consilio suo, quod constitutio illa intelligenda fit, quod siuè effecti fuerunt Bigami ante praedictam constitutionem, siuè post, de catero non liberentur Praelatis, imò fiat de ijs iustitia sicut de Laicis: M.

                        </gap>ext to helpe himself.</note> ouer that of the generall Councell, putterh it downe thus: <hi>It is agreed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, before the King and his Counsell, that the same constitution shalbe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in this wise.</hi> Whereas the Latin speaketh in the present tense, <hi>It is to be vnderstood,</hi> nor hath it the words, <hi>in this wise.</hi> And where <hi>M. Attorney</hi> saith: <hi>They shall not from hence forth be deliuered, but iustice shall be executed vpon them, as vpon other lay men</hi>: those <hi>shalls</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that herby you see the labour that <hi>M. Attorney</hi> taketh to draw a little water to his mill, and yet that nothing commeth but puddle, that driueth not but choaketh the same.

Whereby we may see, in what vigour Ecclesiasticall power was at this day in <hi>England.</hi> And albeit the King being in passion, did storme greatly thereat, and seased presently vpon all the said Bishops goods and lands, as he had done vpon those of the Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne,</hi> and of others before: yet could he not deny, but that this was law &amp; iustice, which the Bishops did, according to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall priuiledges of the Realme, whervnto the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and all his ancestours in their coronations, had solemnely sworne. For breaking wherof it may be presumed, that so great a punishment fell vpon him, as soone after ensued, to the horror of the whole world, by depriuation both of his Kingdome, and life.

Or where is this Common-law? How, or when did it begin (as often elswhere I haue demaunded)? Either by vse, or statute, or common agreement between the Prince and people? For none of these haue we heard of hitherto, vnder former Kings, though for presenting and nomination to benefices, we haue oftentymes said, that there is no difficulty, but that the temporall Prince, may present in such benefices, or Bishopricks, as he is patron of, either founding the said bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:14426:203"/>
or by particular concession of the Sea Apostolicke vnto him; as we haue shewed more largly before in the life of <hi>K. VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and before him againe vnder <hi>K. Edward</hi> the <hi>Confessor,</hi> to whom the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> in those dayes, gaue spirituall iurisdiction also, in some cases, ouer the Abbey of <hi>VVestminster,</hi> &amp; some other places of his Realme.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. But that the Common-law should dispose of these things, <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lavv cannot determine vvho shall giue cure of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vvith spirituall authority belonging therevnto.</note> and especially giue spiritual iurisdiction to the King ouer bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; (for so must the meaning of <hi>M. Attorney</hi> be, if he delude not his Reader with equiuocation of words) this (I say) is both contrary to his owne rule before set downe, and much more to reason. For that to giue Ecclesiasticall iurisdictiom, is much more, then to haue the conusaunce of Ecclesiasticall causes: which he denying to his Common-law, in diuers places of his booke, as before we haue seen, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ascribe to th'other.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Wherefore though we graunt this graduation heer set dovvne, as good and conueuient, <hi>that if the particular patron doe not present within six moneths, nor the Ordinary, or Metropolitan within their tymes prescribed, the Prince as supreme gouernour of the Common-wealth to see all things done in due order, may present, as if he were patron, to the said benefice</hi>; yet first this cannot come originally from the Common-law, for the reasons alleadged. Secondly this proueth no spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall iurisdiction at all in any presentor, but only power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, which may be in any man that hath <hi>Ius patronatus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Church and head therof, as before hath byn said. <note place="margin">This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance maketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst M.

Attorney</hi> would inferre, which is euident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other reasons by this: For that the Prince when he doth present in this manner, by lapse of tyme, or omission of others, is the last in power of presentation, after the Metropolitans and Bishops; which yet should be first, if he were supreme in that sorte of authority, and that the matter went by rigour of law, &amp; not by composition &amp; agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And finally for that the Prince in this case cannot put in a Pastor immediatly from himself, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him spiritual iurisdiction ouer soules; but must present him to the Bishop or Metropolitan, to be induced by him, &amp; indued with that iurisdiction: which he should not doe, if his owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority spirituall were greater then the said Bishops or Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.

               <p n="44">44. For proofe then of this, that King <hi>Richard</hi> did confirme and maintaine, all the dayes of his raigne, these libertyes, franquises, and priuiledges of the Church, and of Clergy-men, appeareth by his owne Statutes: As for example, by the first Statute made in his first yeare, with this title. <hi>A confirmation of the libertyes of the Church</hi>: and the second Statute made in his second yeare hath the same title, and subiect; as also hath the first Statute of his third yeare, and first of his 5. and first of his 6. and first of his seauenth yeare.

King <hi>Richard</hi> stood zealously with the said true Pope, and not only made a Statute in Parlament, that whosoeuer should be obedient to any other person, as Pope, but only to Pope <hi>Vrban,</hi>

                  <hi>should be out of the Kings protection, and his goods seased,</hi> as the words of the Statute are; but also some yeares after that againe when the said Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> had appointed <hi>Henry</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> to be his Captaine general, to passe ouer into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and by force, to constraine the said schismaticall Pope to surcease that diuision; the said King not only allowed, but assisted also that enterprise.</p>

such Synods or Councell, for conuicting of euery particular man, that shall be accused of that heresie: and much lesse was it needfull, that there should be two seuerall conuictions, the one before abiuration, the other after: (except in such as were relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) for what if the hereticke should stand stiffely to it, vpon his first conuiction, and would not abiure, but defend his heresie? did the anncient laws Ecclesiasticall of England (thinke you) forbid him in this case to be punished?

                  <p n="12">12. First then it is presumed in this assertion, that no hereticke could be put to death in old tyme, except he were relapsed, that is to say, had once (at least) abiured his heresie, and fallen vnto it againe: <note place="margin">

The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops also of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that liued with these Kings, <hi>Thomas Bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, Iohn Morton, Henry Deane,</hi> and <hi>VVilliam VVarham</hi> (who was the last Catholicke Archbishop that held that Sea immediatly before <hi>Thomas Cranmer.</hi>) All these (I say) besides other points of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their obedience, and subordination to the said Sea, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the auncient stile of their Catholicke predecessours, write themselues <hi>Legats of the Sea Apostolicke,</hi> as may be seen in <hi>Fox,</hi>

he doe. For what law is that, by iugment wherof the Sanctuarie of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Church in <hi>London</hi> grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the Pope, was disalowed, for so much as all other Sanctuaries had, and haue from that Sea, their franquises, and liberties? Was it Common-law, or Canon and Ecclesiasticall? Not Ecclesiasticall. For that all such law dependeth from thence, and consequently cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to haue disanulled the Popes authority in graunting Sanctuary. Common law if it were, it must appeare how it came in, by whom it was admitted, by what right it came to haue conusau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this Ecclesiasticall cause, which <hi>M. Attorney</hi> so often hath denyed before to apperteyne to his Common-law, wherof ensueth that eyther those temporall Iudges exceeded their limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in handling this cause, or that there was some temporall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance therein that brought it into that Courte.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And surely it may bee that this Sanctuarie pretended by the Prior of the Knights of <hi>S. Iohns in London,</hi> might not onlie bee the ordinary Sanctuarie of their Church and appurtenances the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto (which all Churches haue by Canon law more or lesse) but also of some greater circuite, <note place="margin">Hovv the cause of Sanctuary might be handled by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> round about their said Church and habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which (they being Knights and souldiars) might importe some inconueniences to the common wealth by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of contentions, fights, &amp; brawles that might there fall out, the temporall officers hauing no accesse by reason of the said pretended Sanctuary. And so this case not being meere spirituall, but mixt also with temporall interest of the Common-wealth, the common Iudges, vntill the matter were better discussed and resolued in ecclesiasticall right, might put difficultie about the admission or execution of the said priuiledges, without the Kings expresse consent. And this is answered, according to <hi>M.

Wherby is cleerly declared the meaning of the former cause, to wit, <hi>that the popes excommunication, which is a spirituall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or punishement for spirituall affaires, may not preiudice temporall all suites at the Common-law in temporall matters</hi>; and it is not much sinceritie in <hi>M.

<q>that such Canonicall laws are to bee still in force, as were allowed by generall consent, not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant to the laws, statutes, and customes of this Realme, nor importe anie dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Kings prerogatiue Royall. <note place="margin">Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall lavves made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>

And what are these thinke you? And how vncertaine a rule is this prescribed for laws, whereby matters of conscience must be determined? Who may not say in his owne case, or others; this Canon, or Constitution, though it be of neuer so auncient Councels, or Decrees of the Church, (for of such consisteth the Canon-law) was neuer allowed by generall consent of <hi>England</hi>; this is contrariant to some Statute or Custome; this importeth dammage to the Kings prerogatiue Royall: and so indeed by establishing this new headship, the whole body of Ecclesiasticall regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was ouerthrowne, though <hi>M.

<q>that the said Canonicall lawes should remaine still in force <hi>(with the restrictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s aforesaid)</hi> as the Kings Ecclesiasticall lawes;</q>
which is as much to say, as that these Canon-lawes that were made by generall Councels, Nationall or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall Synods, and by the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> themselues, shall not remaine as their lawes, but as the Kings lawes, for that he retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them: of which poore refuge I haue spoken often before, how weake and idle it is.</p>

I haue said before in the second Chapter of this our confutation, for the confirmation of the exemptions of Clerks, their persons, and goods, out of the Decrees of auncient Christian Emperours, that ratified the Church-Canons in that behalfe, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity therevnto of our Christian Kings before the <hi>Conquest,</hi> handled in the 5. &amp; 6.

               <p n="8">8. In the second point, being no lesse notoriously vntrue then the first, he offereth the said Catholickes much more iniury, in


<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14426:243"/>
affirming, that vpon this occasion of the Bul of <hi>Pius quintus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> they first refused to goe to the Church, as not holding her for true and lawfull Queene: insinuating therby another consequence also, much more false and malicious then this, to wit, that the same may be said and vnderstood of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Catholickes at this day, in respect of his Maiesty that now is. But the vntruth of this assertion is most manifest, both by that we haue shewed before, that great multitudes of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes refused euen from the beginning to goe to Protestant-Churches, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See the booke intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.</hi>
                  </note> though then the matter was not much vrged against them; as also by this other reason, for that their holding the Queene, for true, or vnlawfull, was, and is impertinent to the matter of going to Church: Nay, their holding her for not Queen (if any so did) did rather disoblige, then oblige them to this recusancy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The reason heerof is, for that one principall cause binding them in conscience not to goe to the seruice of a different, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite religion to their owne, was the precept and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen by the said Queene, <hi>that all should repaire to the said ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to shew their conformity &amp;c.</hi> For that the obeying of this precept in matters of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (they offering themselues otherwise to goe to any Church for temporall matters) was a kind of publike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying their owne faith: As for example; if in <hi>Persia</hi> at this day, or other places of differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Religion, Christians liuing there should of their owne curiosity goe sometimes to the Churches or <hi>Moscies</hi> of that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, to heare &amp; see only what is there done, though not to pray or worship; or (which is lesse) should carry or weare their Turbant or <hi>Mahometan</hi> habit, it were not so great a matter of offence; but if the King, or Emperour should commaund the same to be done in attestation of their conformity of religion, <note place="margin">Consider vvell this reason.</note> now this precept doth make it much more vnlawful, though yet if he were not true King indeed, nor true magistrate that should make such a precept, but some priuate man of his owne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; euery man seeth, that it would rather diminish, then encrease the obligation of recusancy, And so <hi>M. Attorney,</hi> when he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>that Catholickes first began their recusancy of going to Church, vpon this persuasion that Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was not lawfull Queene,</hi> he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth circstuma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that might rather, in some sort, facilitate their going, then encrease their obligation to the same recusancy. For that her precept and commaundement binding them not at all,


<pb n="373" facs="tcp:14426:244"/>
as not Queene, they were freed thereby of that obligation, as before hath byn said, springing of this head of Royall commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
               <p n="10">10. This then is the first great iniury, which <hi>M.

                  <hi>In all this tyme, no law was either made, or attempted against them for their recusancy, though it were grounded vpon so disloyall a cause, as hath byn said.</hi> And againe a little after talking of the penall laws, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them for the same recusancy, he saith:
<q>That it was a milde, aud mercifull law, considering their former conformity, and the cause of their reuolt.</q>
But I hauing shewed now, that there was no such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conformity before, and consequently no reuolt, and much lesse any such cause of reuolt, as he faineth to himself; the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth of these charges, and the wrong done therby to innocent men, is made euident and manifest.</p>

All which Kings and Queens, Counsellors, Nobilitie, Archbishops, Bishops, Doctors, Vniuersities, Lawyers, and Sages of all sortes, were for so manie ages by one, and the self-same religion, profession, and beleife, directed and saued, if anie were saued: that is to say, by the selfsame means, doctrine and Sacraments of our auncient Catholicke English Church continuing vntill <hi>K.

               <head>THE THIRD EXPOSTVLATION, In the name of all moderate and peace-louing subiects whatsoeuer. §. III.</head>
               <p n="31">31. My third complaint or expostulation with <hi>M. Attorney</hi> is yet more generall, as concerning not onlie all sortes of Catholickes whatsoeuer, but other men in like manner of any profession in Christian religion that are wise, moderate, peaceable, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of the tranquillitie of the Prince and State where they liue, who out of their prudence, easilie doe foresee, cannot but incurre danger of perturbation by immoderate exasperation of minds, <note place="margin">The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise by the insolency of some priuate men.</note> when particular men (otherwise not loued but rather hated, or enuyed for their extraordinarie fortunes, riches, and aduauncements) doe passe to such insolencie of speach and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauiour, as they seeke to drawe whole multitudes into disgrace and daunger, by vniust oppresion. We know, and may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber out of our histories, what general exulceratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hartes haue risen in former years against <hi>Huberts de Burgo, Gauestons, Spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cers, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timers, Veares, Scroops, Catesbies, Ratcliffes, Louels, Empsons, Dudleys,</hi> and other vpon like occasions, for that they were thought, or suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to incite the Prince vnder whome they liued, to the vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued hurts and ruines of many others.</p>
               <p n="32">32. And surelie what <hi>M. Attorney</hi> hath perfourmed, or attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this behalfe, partlie by his iniurious speaches at the barrs where he pleadeth, partlie by this his Booke, and other means, against so great a multitude of his Maiesties Subiects, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke partie and their well-willers are, both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; is not heard to consider: for so much, as he maketh their verie beleife, or act of vnderstanding, <note place="margin">Men brought into des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all reason and duty.</note> which lyeth not in their handes to alter at their pleasure, to bee disloialtie and treason (as before hath byn shewed) and consequentlie that against their wills they must be traitors. Wherof ensueth againe another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence worse then this, which is, that when men see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:14426:250"/>
vrged, egged, and pressed in matters that lie not in their owne hands to remedie, &amp; this also as they persuade themselues, not so much by the inclination of the Prince, as by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie &amp; insolencie of others, that being wanton with wealth, delight themselues in other mens vexations; this perswasion (I say) when once it entereth into the head of multitudes in any common-wealth, driueth men to extreme impatience, and vtter despaire of redresse; the only remedy wherof, is none other, but to preuent the occasion it selfe.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And (truly) it may be probably hervpon inferred (and so it is also thought of diuers at home and abroad) that this Booke of <hi>Reportes</hi> of <hi>M. Attorneys</hi> comming forth at the time when it did, and beating to the end, which before we haue seen, presented also particularlie to his Maiesty, <note place="margin">The exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="34">34. Wherfore the summe of this my expostulation with <hi>M. Attorney</hi> is, that hee being otherwise a wise, and learned man (as in his profession I take him to bee, by his preferments) and not insolent, or cruell by nature (as willinglie I incline to beleiue) would at such a time, as he saw so great a multitude of Catholike people greiuously afflicted for their religion, come forth with so odious and new drift against them, <note place="margin">A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
