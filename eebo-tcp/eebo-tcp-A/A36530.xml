         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE General Remarks that are made of thoſe two Elements Fire and Water, that they are good Sevants, but bad Maſters, may in a great meaſure be ſaid of that Grand Compound <hi>Powder;</hi> for tho' it be a good Servant, in all times of neceſſity, for to ſerve as a Defence againſt the Aſſaults and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of our Enemies; yet when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Inſtrument of Deſtruction to Humane kind, when at its own Conduct, nothing is more Detrimental to its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In <hi>Hackney-Marſh</hi> on the Brinks of the ſaid River, diſtant three Miles and a half from <hi>London,</hi> lately ſtood three Mills, two whereof were for the uſe of making of Gun-powder, and the other for grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bark for Dying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the Nineteenth of this Inſtant <hi>April,</hi> 1690. about the Hour of Seven in the Evening, one of the two above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gun-Powder-Mills took Fire, and in an inſtant blew up it ſelf, and tearing up the Trees and Earth, reached the other, which likewiſe blew-up, with ſeveral lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Weavering Rooms, all which it laid level with the Ground in a moment; it gave but two Reports, but of ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a nature, that it amazed not only <hi>Hackney</hi> and other adjacent Towns, but even the whole City of <hi>London,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gree, that it has occaſioned matter of much Diſpute and Obſervation among the Curious; for tho' the Naturaliſt do give diverſe Reaſons for Earth-quakes, and their ſtrange ſhaking the Earth for a great circumference, the Chief of which, is its being ledged for a time in the grand Caverns and Channels of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet this laſt Example is a Matter of more Novelty, and no leſs dreadful conſequence to the poor Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons aſſigned for its taking Fire is variouſly ſaid, ſome ſay, the over-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs of the Work-men, in working a longer time than (by their Rules) they ought, to get Money for their Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Expences the Week following; but the more conſiderate Neighbours adjacent do believe, That they were miſtaken in their Time about an hour, through their neglect in counting, and forgetting to Turn up their Hour Glaſſes, by which their <hi>Punns,</hi> that their Powders beat into over heated, and occaſioned the <hi>Gun-Powder</hi> to take Fire, as them Skilled in thoſe Affairs affirm it will.</p>
            <p>There is Six poor Souls killed, Four Men kind, and Two Women, one of which is the Maſter of the <hi>Powder Mills,</hi> who lies upon the Earth, another a Miniſter that Lodged there, whoſe Head is beaten clear off, and his Intrails hangs out of his Body, a Boys Face and Breaſt viſible, his other parts being buried in the Earth, an Antient Woman lying with the upper part of her body above, and her lower part under the Ground; another blown into the River, they all lying there to be viewed by the Beholders, as miſerable Spectacles of humane miſery; ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſcaped by leaping into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>There was (in the <hi>Store-houſe,</hi> which was adjoyning to the <hi>Mills</hi>) Two hundred and Sixty Barrels of Gun-Powder, the loſs of which, with the two <hi>Mills,</hi> a Dwelling Houſe, two ſmall Houſes for weaving of Cloath, being wholly Ruined; alſo two other large Houſes adjoyning, with the <hi>Dying Mill;</hi> all which, though they are ſtill ſtanding, yet miſerably Shattered, with other Damage; in all valued at <hi>Four Thouſand</hi> Pounds Sterling.</p>
