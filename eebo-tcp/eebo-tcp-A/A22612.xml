            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of these opinions our prechers &amp; lerned men gaue warninge that they dyd varie and dissente from holy scripture / &amp; did hurt &amp; diminyshe the glorie of the passion of Christ / for the passon of Christ was an oblation and a satisfactyon not onely for the synne of byrthe (called origynall syn) but also for all other synnes / as it is wryten to the Ebrues / we are sanctifyed by the oblatyon of Iesu Christ ones for euer / Also / he made perfect the sanctifyed without oblation for euer. Also the scrypture teacheth vs to be iustifyed before god by faythe in Christe when we beleue that our synnes be forgyuen vs for Christe. Nowe if

the Masse dothe take awaye the synnes of the quicke and of the deade euen of the owne proper vertue: then iustifycation dothe chaunce &amp; come of the worke of Masses / &amp; not of fayth. Whiche thynge scripture doth not suffer / but Christ com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundeth to do it in rememberaunce of hym.

And that the worlde dyd so thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke / it appereth by that / that newe cere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monies / newe orders / newe holy dayes / &amp; newe fastynges / were dayly instituted / and teachers in temples / did exacte and require these workes as a necessarie honour to the obteynynge of rightuousnes / and they greatly did put in feare the sely consciences yf they shulde omitte and leue vndone any of these thynges. Of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of traditions / many myschiefes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniencies ensued in the churche. Fyrste of all / the doctrine of grace and the ryghtuousnes of faythe was obscured and defaced / whiche is the chief parte of the gospell / and ought most of all to stonde forthe and to appere in the church / to the entente that the meryte of Christ myght be wel knowen / and that fayth / which beleueth that sinnes be forgyuen for Christe / and not for any of our workes / myght be aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced and set vppe farre aboue workes. Wherfore Paule also leaneth greatly to this part / and remoueth and putteth awaye the lawe and traditions of men because he wold shewe that the christian rightu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ousnes is an other thynge then suche workes / 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9761:22"/>
that is to wyt / that it is faythe / which beleueth that synnes be frely forgiuen for Christe. But this doctrine of Paule is almoste all together oppressed by traditions / which haue engendred and brought forthe an opinion that we muste neades meryte and get remission of sinnes and iustification by diuersitie of meates / and lyke honorynge of god. In penaunce there was no spekynge of faythe / only these satisfactory wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes were purposed and set forthe / the hole pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce appered to consyste and stonde in them. Secundarely these tradityons haue obscured and darkened the preceptes of god / because that traditions of men were preferred and regarded aboue the preceptes of god. The hole christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie was thought to be the obseruatyon and kepinge of certayne feries / rytes / fastinges / and vestures. These obseruations had by longe pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scription of time won them selues a very hyghe &amp; an honeste tytle. for they onely were called the spiritual lyfe / &amp; perfecte lyfe. But in the meane season the preceptes of god executed accordinge to a mans vocation and callynge had no laude nor prayse / as that the father and good man of the house brought vp his children / that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chylded / that the prynce gouerned the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men welthe / these thynges were thought to be worldly workes and vnperfect / and farre worse then those shyninge and glitteringe obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And thys errour dyd greatly vexe &amp; greue wel disposed consciencies / which were sory that they were holden in an vnperfecte kynde &amp; state
<pb facs="tcp:9761:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of lyuinge / as in mariage / in gouernaunce and in other offices &amp; ciuile ministrations. On the other syde they magnifyed and had in hyghe re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>putation the Monkes and such lyke cloisterers whiche call them selues religious parsons / and thought (though vntruly) that theyr obseruati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons dyd a greate dele more deserue remission of synnes and iustifycation / than the symple lyfe of a christian man dyd. Thirdly / traditions brought greate parell and daunger to conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces / for it was impossible to kepe al traditions / and yet men iudged these obseruations to be ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessary worshyppynges and honoryng of god.

                     <p>Nor it is no newe matter that we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The olde definicion ryghtly vnderstande sounde to the same effecte, when it sayeth that originall synne is a lackynge of originall ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. But what is iustice? Scolemen do here brable of logicall questions, but they expound
<pb facs="tcp:9761:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nat what is originall iustyce. Undoubtedly iustice in scriptures conteyneth nat onely the seconde table of the Decalogie, but the fyrste also whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth the feare of god / the faythe in god, the loue of god. So that iustice originall shulde haue had nat onely an egall temperame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the qualities of the bodie, but also these gyftꝭ / a notice of god more certain / the feare of god / the affiau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in god / or at leste a direction and power to do these thynges. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wytnesseth the scripture wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it sayeth, that man was create to the image &amp; similitude of god which is nothyng else, but that to man this wysdome and iustice was naturally gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with whiche he myght compasse and conceiue god, and in whiche god myght be apparantly noted and sene / this is to say, that to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these gyftꝭ, the notice of god, the dreade of god, the truste in god, and suche lyke. For thus dothe Ireneus interprete the similitude of god, and also Ambrose whiche besyde other thyngꝭ which he spake for this purpose dothe expresly gather in this wyse. <hi>Non est ergo anima ad imaginem dei, in qua deus non semper est.</hi> It is nat then the soule that was made to the ymage of god, for in it, god is nat alwayes. And Paule to the Ephesians and Colossenses shewe the ymage of god to be the notice of god / iustice and veritie. And Longobardus is nat aferde to say that iustice originall is the very simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of god, which god gaue to man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we recite the sentencies of the olde fathers whiche do nothynge lette saynt Austins interpretacyon of the ymage.</p>

                        <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> wherfore the olde definicion, that calleth originall synne the lacke of iustice detracteth

By this it appereth that the olde defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion dothe speake the same thyng that we do. detractyng or plucking away the feare of god and hope, that is to say, nat only actual dedes but also the gyftes and myght to do this.</p>
                     <p>The same sentence hathe the definicyon of Austyne, who vsethe to define originall synne to be concupiscence. For he meaneth that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iustice was loste, concupiscence succeded. For the decayed nature because it can nat feare, loue, and truste god, it seketh and loueth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall thynges. The iudgement of god, thys sycke &amp; corrupte nature eyther voyde of feare despyseth, or beynge replenyshed with feare hateth. Thus Austyne compriseth aswele the defaulte or faylyng, as the viciouse qualitie whiche therof ensueth. Nor this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is nat only a corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the qualities of the bodie, but also an vnryght turnyng to thyngꝭ carnal in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> superiour powers. Nor they se nat what they saye whiche do bothe attribute to man concupiscence nat mortified of the holy ghoste, &amp; also the loue of god aboue althyngꝭ. we therfore haue ryghtly expressed bothe two in the description of original synne, that is to saye, those defautes, as nat to be of power to beleue god, nat to be of power to dreade and

And Paule cyteth the hystorye of Abraham. Abraham bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God, and it was recompted vnto hym for ryghtwysnes. That is to wytte, Abraham perceyued that God was vnto hym mercyful, only for hys promyse sake.

Syn was aboundaunt by the lawe. But grace by Iesus was more aboundant. For after that the hole worlde was become subiecte, he toke away the sinne of the hole worlde, as testifieth Iohan saing.

tencies of the lawe, one solution may be gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the lawe can nat be done without Chryst, &amp; if any ciuile workes be done without Christ, they please not god. Wherfore when the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes be preached it is necessarye to be added that fayth is requyred, that for faythe they be preached, that they be frutes and testimonies of faythe. What thynge can be spoken more symply and syncerely tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this doctryne? For it is necessarie to the knowledge of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes of Christ to discerne the promyses from the lawe: Ambiguouse and perilous causes do engender many and sundry solutions. But in good and ferme causes one or two solutions taken out of the fountaynes do answere all that maye be obiected. Whiche thynge also appereth in thys our cause. For that rule whiche I ryght nowe recyted expounneth all the saynges whiche be recited of the lawe and of the workes. For we graunte that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture otherwhyles doth teache the lawe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whyles the free promyse of remyssyon of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for Christe. But our aduersaries do vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly destroy the promyse in sainge that fayth dothe not iustifie, but teache that for our loue and workes we receyue remission of synnes, &amp; reconciliation. For yf remissyon of synnes shulde hange of the condicion of our workes, so were it very vncertayne. For we neuer do sufficient workes. Then the promyse shall be put out of yre. Wherfore we call agayne good myndes to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of the promisses, and we teache them of the free remyssyon and reconcilement that is made by the faythe in Christe. After thys, we adde also the doctrine of the lawe, nat that by the lawe we shulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue

For we muste wysely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincte the lawe and the promyses. It must be sene what scripture gyueth to the lawe, and what to the promyses. For it prayseth and commaundeth good workes in such sorte that it taketh not awaye the free promyse nor the benefyte that we haue by Christe.

                        </note> Althoughe it may here be answered in sundry wyses of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: yet we wyl simpely recite the meaning of Paule. Certayne it is that Paule speaketh of the loue of the neyghbour. Nor it is nat to be thought that Paule attributeth eyther ius<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before god, to the workꝭ of the seconde table, rather than to the workꝭ of the fyrste. Furthermore if loue be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte fulfyllyng of the lawe and satisfyeth the lawe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we nede nat Christe to be our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and redemer. But Paule teacheth that we be therfore accepted for Christ and nat for the fulfyllyng of the lawe, because the fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of the lawe is nat perfyte. Wherfore syth in other place as he manifestly plucketh from vs perfection, it is nat to be thought that he speaketh here of the personall perfection of euery particular persone, but speaketh of the comune integritie and vnitie of the churche. For to this entent he sayeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> loue is a bonde or knyttyng together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because he wolde signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto vs that he speketh of the couplyng or knyttyng together of all the membres of the churche.

at and forgyuen: so commaundeth Paule that in the churche be kept loue and charitie to the reteynyng of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>corde, and whiche shall beare otherwhyles (when nede requyreth) the boystous manners of theyr bretherne, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng certayne lyte offensies, lest the churche runne into sundry Schismes and dissensions and of Schismes do ryse hatredes, secres, &amp; heresies. For it can no otherwyse be, but that concorde shalbe broken, when the byshoppes do laye on the peoples backes harder bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens than is expedyent and haue no manner regarde of the peoples imbecilitye. Also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes do ryse whan the people iudgeth ouer sharpely of the maners of theyr teachers, or dispiseth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for certayne lyte causes, sekinge then an other kinde of doctryne and other tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers.

way to god through faythe.</hi> Therfore as often tymes as workes be required and praysed, the gospell of Christe is to be put vnto. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, these textes, which I haue a lytle here tofore recited, be well nere sermons or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynges of penaunce / for they be made of two partes. They haue in the begynnynge prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the lawe, whiche rebuketh synne, and commaundeth good workes. Afterwade there is added a promyse. But this is moste certein and vndoubted, that in preachynge of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, it is nat sufficient to préache the lawe whiche dothe comonly trouble and conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne the coscience. But it is requysite, that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the gospell be added that synnes be frely forgyuen for Christe, and that by faythe, we obtayne remission of synnes. These thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be so certayne and so clere, that if our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries wolde vary from them, and exclude Christe and faythe from the preachyng of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce: they were worthy to be reiected as persones blasphemous agaynst Christ. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sermon of Daniel ought nat onely to be applyed to almose deades but faythe also is to be requyred in it. The sermon of Daniel is farre vnlyke the speache of Aristotle, who wryttyng vnto his kynge Alexander,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aristotle to kynge Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.</hi>
                        </note> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so exhorte hym to liberalite, and counseilleth him to vse his power to the comen vtilite and to the welth of al the people and nat to pride. For thus he wrytteth to Alexander, <hi>wherfore assay and endeuour your selfe to vse &amp; apply your Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piere and dominion nat to any contumely or pryde but to munificence and liberalite.</hi> For sothe thys was a very honest sayeng and there coulde nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g be sayde better touchi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the duetie of a greate

prynce. But Daniell instructeth and teacheth his kyng nat only of his office or calling: but also of repentaunce, of loue, and deuotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes god / of remission of synnes / and of those greate thynges, whiche be clene aboue philosophy. Nat only therfore almouse deadꝭ be to be requyred here: but also faythe. And that the texte dothe declare, where it sayeth that the kyng was conuerted, nat only to gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of almouse, but muche rather to faythe. For there remayneth yet the excellent confes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sion of that kynge, and prayse of the god of Israel. <hi>There is none other god, whiche can saue in this wyse.</hi> So then there be two partes of the sermon of Daniel. The one parte is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, whiche rebuketh synnes and gyueth monition of a newe lyfe sayeng. <hi>Redeame thy synnes with ritghtuousnes, &amp; thy wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes with benefites towardes y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> pore.</hi>

For Daniel knewe that remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of si<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes was promised for the sede that was to come (that is to wyt) Christ, and that nat only to the Israelites, but also to al nations. For els he coulde nat haue promysed to the kynge remissyon of synnes. For it belongeth nat to man, namely in the affrayes of synne, to decre, &amp; determyne of the wille of god without some assured worde of god, that he wyll cease to be angry. Therfore syth here is a promyse put, it appereth sufficiently, that faythe is requyred, for a promise ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nat be receyued but by fayth. Yf thꝭ fayth shuld depende vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of workes, then were remissyon vncertayne.

We ought to call our selues backe from this carnall opinion to the gospell and to the promyse of mercye, in which is freely exhibited remission of synnes for Christes sake.

The fyrste parte requireth good workes.

Therfore our forgiuing, which is acceptable and pleasaunt to god, foloweth goddes forgiuynge. Nowe Christe is wonte after suche sort to ioyne together the lawe, &amp; the gospell, that he dothe teache bothe two, I meane the doctryne of fayth and the doctrine of good workes, to thend he shuld admonishe vs that it is but hypocrisy and a faynynge of

                        <hi>who therfore is a synner maculate with any spotte, can not be sayde of the churche of Christe, nor subiecte to Christ.</hi> Wherfore although hypocritꝭ and euyll men be felowes of this true churche accordynge to externe rytes: yet whan the churche is defined, we must nedes define that whiche is the lyuynge bodye of Christe, and which is the churche both in name &amp; in de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if we shulde onely define the churche to be an externe polecie of good and euyl, men shal not vnderstande that the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ is the iustice of the herte, and a gyuynge of the holy ghoste, but shall iuge it only to by an outwarde kepi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of certaine rytꝭ &amp; ceremonies.

But in the people of the lawe besyde the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse made of Christ / also the carnal sede had ꝓmises of corporal thingꝭ, of a kyngdome. &amp;c.

also they whiche amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge them were euyll. For god seuered this carnall sede from the rest of the gentyles by certayn externe ordinaunces and promyses. And yet those euyll persones pleased not god. But the euangell bryngeth not a shadowe of eternall thingꝭ, but the selue thynges whiche be eternal, as the holy ghost, and ryghtwysenes, by whiche we be rightwyse before god. Wherfore they only be the people accordyng to the gospel, whiche receyue this promyse of the spirite. Besyde this, the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the kyngdome of Christ, distincte from the kyngdome of the deuyll. But certayne it is that wycked men be in the power of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and membres of his kyngdome, as Paule teacheth sayinge,<note place="margin">

And Christe sayth to the phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees (whiche without doubte had an externe societe with the churche, that is to wyte, with the holy persones that were in the people of the lawe, for they were rulers, they sacrifised and taughte) <hi>Ye be of your father the deuyll.</hi> So that the churche, which is the true kingdome of Christe, is proprely the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation of the godly. For the wycked be ruled of the deuyll, and be his captiues &amp; prisoners, they be not ruled by the spirite of Christ. But what nede mo wordꝭ in so manifest a thyng? If the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, whiche is truely the kyngdome of Christ is distincte from the kyngdome of the deuyll, it ensueth necessarily that wycked men, which be in the kyngedome of the deuyll, be not the churche, Althoughe in this lyfe because the kyngdome of Christe is not yet declared and opened, they be myxed with the true churche, and beare offices in the churche / nor the wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:9761:94"/>
be not therfore of the ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gdome of Christ, bicause the reuelation &amp; openi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the matter is not yet made. For this is alway the kynge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ, whiche he by his spirite viui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, be it disclosed or hydde by the crosse. Lykewyse as Christ is the selfe same, whiche is nowe glorified, and whiche was before cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and afflicte. And to this agree the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes of Christe, whiche clerely sayth, that the good sede be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> chyldren of the kyngdome,<note place="margin">

Neyther do we dreme of a Platonical citie (as certain men do wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly belye vs) but we do saye, that this hath
<pb facs="tcp:9761:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a beinge and is in dede, euen the true beleuers and ryghtous men sparcled &amp; scatered abrode throughout the hole worlde. And we put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, tokens and markes, the pure doctrine of the gospell, and due administration of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes. And this churche is proprely the pyller of trouthe, for it holdeth faste the true and pure gospell, and (as Paule saythe) the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, whiche is the true knowledge and faythe of Christ, albeit there be euen amonge these also manye weyke persones, whiche v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fundation do buylde stubble or strawe that shall perysshe, that is to say, certayne vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>profitable opinions, whiche yet bicause they do not ouerturne and destroye the fundation, be partly forgyuen them, and partly also be a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mended. But the wrytynges of the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do witnesse, that otherwhiles they haue also buylded stubble vpon the fundation, but yet suche haue not ouerthrowen theyr fayth. But the most parte of these thynges, whiche our aduersaries do defende, do quite &amp; cleane ouerthrowe the faythe / as (for example) that they do condempne the article of remission of synnes. In whiche we do say, that by fayth is receyued remission of synnes. It is a a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feste and a perylous errour also, that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries do teache men to merite remission of sinnes by loue towardes god, before grace. For this also is to take awaye the fundation, (that is to witte) Christe. Also what shall we nede faythe, if the sacramentes iustifie by the vertue of the warke that is wrought, without the good motion of mynde? And lykewyse as the churche hath a ꝓmyse, that it shall alway haue the holy ghoste: so hath it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minations

And this diffinition not of the churche of Christ, but of the kyngdome of the pope, hath auctores for it, not only cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistꝭ, but also Daniell in the .xj. chaptre. That if we wolde define the churche after this faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ꝑaduenture we shulde haue more egall and indifferent iudges.

                     <p>Many men also do openly scorne all good ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and the true &amp; syncere religion of Christ, or yf they do prayse any thynge, they prayse those thynges, whiche are agreinge to the rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son of men.

Wherfore we according to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures do thinke, that the churche taken in his

proper sygnifycation: is the congregation of holy men, which do truly beleue the gospel of Christe, and haue the holy ghost. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles we graunte that there be many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and euell men mengled amonge them in this lyfe, which haue a societie &amp; feloshype of outwarde sygnes and sacramentes, &amp; which be members of the churche, as touchynge the societie of outwarde signes, and therfore they beare offices in the Churche.

For the apostelles wolde nat that we shulde thynke ourselues iustifyed by suche rites, or that suche rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, be necessary to iustice in the syghht of god.

It is nat y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe to alledge an example. They obserued and kepte certayne dayes, nat because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same obseruation was necessary to iustification but that the people shulde knowe, what tyme they ought to come together. They obserued also certayne other rites and ceremonies, as the ordre of the lessons, at what tyme they cam to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether.

doctrine concernynge these questions whiche I haue rehersed: amonge our aduersaries is full of errours and hypocrisie, and defaceth obscureth and endymmeth the benefyte of Christ, the power of the keyes, and the iustice of faythe. These thynges be done in the fyrst acte or parte of the playe. But what whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be come vnto confession? What infinite and greate busines is there in that endles reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, numbryng and reckenyng vp of synnes? Whiche neuertheles for a greate parte is spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and consumed in mans traditions and lawes. And because that the good and deuoute myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des myght be the more vexed: they fayne and ymagen that this rehersall and iuste reckeni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of the synnes is commaunded by goddꝭ lawe. And though they do exacte and require thys rehersall of all the synnes vnder the pretence of the lawe of god: yet in the meane season of absolution whiche is in dede of the lawe of god they speake full slenderly and full coldly. They fayne that the selfe sacrament, <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> that is to say, euen of the very worke that is wrought gyueth and conferreth grace without any good mocion of the vser. But of faythe who receyueth the absolution and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the conscience: is made no mencio nat all.

<pb facs="tcp:9761:106"/>
and parte they teache to be redemed with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions. They adde moreouer that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions must be workes of suꝑerogation, and them they set and put in moste folyshe obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunces, whiche haue not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of god to beare them, as in pylgrymages, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and lyke obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whiche be mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned by no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of god. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more lykewyse as· they redeme Purgatorye with satisfactions: so hath there ben a crafte deuised of redemynge satisfactions, whiche hath ben a very gayngfull &amp; profytable crafte and hath broughte in moche lucre. For they sell pardones, whiche they do interprete to be releaseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tꝭ of satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And this gaynes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in not onely by them that be alyue: but moche more largely by them, whiche be deade. And not onely by pardons, but also by the sacrifice of the masse they redeme the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions of deade men. Finally the matier of satisfactions is endeles.

But that is an vnfaythfull hope and a vessell apte &amp; mete to receyue malediction: when we do synne in hope. Howebeit that ought nat to be called any hope or truste at all, but rather a certayne insensibilitie, &amp; a perelous dissimulation. For what truste hathe he whiche regardeth nat the ieoperdye? Or what remedy of feare is there, where neyther feare is felt, neyther the mater it selfe and cause of feare? Truste is a comfort but he nedeth no comfort whiche is mery whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hathe done amisse, and reioyceth in his vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gracious factꝭ. Let vs therfore (o bretherne)

pray that answere may be made vnto vs, howe greate iniquities and synnes we haue. Let vs desyre to haue our synnes and trespasses she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto vs. Let vs serche and ransake our wayes / and all our studies and all our ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies let vs consider and ponder with diligent intention. Let euery man say in his feare and dreade, <hi>I shall go to the gates of helle,</hi> to the ende we may nowe reste and comforte our selues in the only mercy of god. This is the true truste of man shrynkyng away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him selfe and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to his lorde. Thys (I say) is the trewe truste, to whiche mercie is nat denyed, wytnes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syng the Prophete in the psalme. The lorde hathe bene wele plesed with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feare him and in them whiche truste vpon hys mercie. And there is verely in vs no lytle cause of feare and in him no lytle cause of truste. Thus farre speaketh Bernarde, whose sentence and mynde we were therfore the more wyllyng to reporte that the readers myght see &amp; perceiue howe we in thꝭ place do take fayth to be mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the hope of mercie whiche lyfteth vp and comforteth affrayed myndes, whiche faythe Bernarde calleth ryght wele fiduciam that is to say truste. And this may be euidently sene, when there is made an antithesis or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of terrours and of comfortes. Lykewyse as Barnarde here wyl that there be in men an acknowlegyng of synnes or contrition or ter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rours. And wyl also that there be added trust whiche may lyfte vp and comforte vs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. But because our aduersaries do here principally &amp; expressely condempne vs where we saye that men by faythe obteyne remission of synnes: we wyll adde a certayne fewe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations
<pb facs="tcp:9761:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by whiche it may be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that forgyuenes of synnes do chaunce nat by the worke wrought for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trition, but by that espe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cial faythe, by whiche euery persone beleueth that he is forgyuen and pardoned of his syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for Christes sake. For this is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal article about which we do stryue with our aduersaryes, and the knowledge wherof we thynke to be moste necessarie to all Christen men. But forasmoche as we seme to haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ynoughe of the same thynge before in the title of iustification: therfore here we wyll be the shorter. For they be placꝭ very moche like &amp; as who wolde say, nere cosyns, the doctrine of repentaunce, and the doctrine of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Our aduersaries when they speake of faythe &amp; say that it goeth before repentaunce, they meane faythe nat this whiche iustifyeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that whiche in a generalitie beleueth that god is, and that there be paynes ordeyned for wycked men. &amp;c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But we ouer &amp; besydes that faythe do require, that euery man shuld beleue hys synnes to be forgyuen hym for Christes sake. About this speciall faythe we stryue and do set it againste the opinion whiche byddeth to truste nat in the promyse of Christe, but in the worke wrought of contrition, of confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of satisfactions. &amp;c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

This is the testimonie, which the holy ghost heareth in thy herte, sayenge, Thy synnes be released the. For thus iudgeth thapostle that man is freely iustified by fayth. These wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Barnarde do wonderfullye illustrate and set forthe our cause, for he not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in a generalitie, that we shulde beleue our synnes to be pardoned throughe mercye, but byddethe vs also put to a speciall faythe, by whiche we may beleue, that euen vnto our owne selues sinnes be pardoned. And he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth howe we may be assured of remission of synnes, that is to saye, whan by faythe hertes be lifted vp, and be made quiete and set at rest by the holy ghoste. What do our aduersaries require more? Dare they yet deny, that we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne remission of synnes through fayth? Or that faythe is a parte of penaunce?</p>

                        </note> Thyrdly. Our aduersaries say, that synne is in this wyse forgyuen, because he that is attrite or contrite doth brynge forthe an acte of the loue of god, &amp; that by this acte he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth to receyue remission of synnes. This is nothyng els but to teache the lawe, and to destroy and abrogate the gospell, and to disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null the promyse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng Christ. For they
<pb facs="tcp:9761:116"/>
do onely require the lawe and our workes, for the lawe requireth loue. Besydes this, they do teache vs to truste that we obteyne remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of synnes, bicause of contrition and loue. What other thynge is this, than to sette oure trust and confidence vpon our owne workes, and not vpon the worde and promyse made by god of Christe? Nowe if the lawe be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the obteynyng of remission of synnes, to what purpose nede we the Gospell? what nede haue we of Christe, if for our workes we obteyne forgyuenes of synnes? But we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywyse do calle agayne consciences from the lawe vnto the gospell, and from the truste in theyr owne workꝭ, to truste and to haue sure confidence in the promyse, and in Christe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the gospell setteth forthe Christe vnto vs, and promyseth remission of synnes freely for Christꝭ sake. By this promyse the gospel byddeth vs trust, that for Christes sake we be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to the father, and brought in to his fauour agayne: and not for our owne contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for our owne loue. For there is none other mediator or pacifier than Christe. Neyther can we worke the lawe, oneles we be fyrste reconciled by Christe. And though we coulde do any thyng: yet we ought to thinke that not for these workꝭ we obteyne remission of synnes, but for Christes sake, whiche is the mediator and mercye stocke. Yea it is iniurie and dishonour to Christe, and a defeatyng of the gospell, to thynke that we do obteyne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synnes for the law, or by any other wayes, than through faythe in Christe. And this reason we haue handeled before in the title of iustification, whan we tolde wherfore
<pb facs="tcp:9761:116"/>
we do holde opinion that men be iustified by fayth, and not by loue. Therfore the doctrine of our aduersaries, where as they teache, that men for contrition and loue obteyne forgyue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of synnes, and bydde them truste in this contrition and loue, is only a doctrine of the lawe, and that not vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Lykewyse as the Iewes dyd loke vpon the couered face of Moyses, For admitte that we had loue, let vs imagyne that we had workes: yet can neither loue, neither workes be a price, raunsome, or propitiation for synne. Neyther can they be set and pleded, as it were in barre, agaynste the wrathe and iudgement of god, accordyng to that sayenge of Dauid in the psalme: <hi>Thou shalte nat entre in to iudgement with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt: for no creature lyuyng shall be iustified in thy syghte.</hi> Neyther ought the honoure of Christ to be plucte from hym, &amp; gyuen to our workꝭ. For these causes Paule dothe styffly affirme, that we be not iustified by the lawe, and he set<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth agaynst the lawe, the ꝓmyse of remission of synnes, whiche is gyuen for Christes sake, and reacheth vs, that we freelye for Christis sake thrugh fayth receiue remission of sinnes. To this promyse Paule dothe calle vs backe from the lawe, Upon this promyse be byddeth vs stedfastly to beholde, which doutles shalbe voyde and of no strength, if we be iustified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the lawe, or euer we be iustified by the promyse, or if we obteyne remission of synnes for our owne iustice. But the case is cleare, that therfore the promyse was made vnto vs, and therfore Christ was gyuen to vs,<note place="margin">

What a monstruous thynge than is it to say, that the satisfaction of Christe dothe redeme the synne or offence, and our paynes do redeme eternall deathe? so that nowe that sayenge, I shal be thy deathe, ought to be vnderstande not of Christ, but of our workes, and that not of workes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by god, but of certeyne colde ceremonies deuised by men.

God, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>descendyng to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes infirmitie hath sette and ordeyned to man a measure of these thinges, vnto whiche he is bounden of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and that is the obseruyng of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes: so that with the residue of workes, whiche they call workes of suꝑerogation, he may make satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces &amp; sinnes. Here they fayne, that men may so worke and fulfyll the lawe of god, that they may also do more than the lawe dothe require. But the scripture euerywhere dothe crye, that we be farre of from that perfection, whiche the lawe requirethe. But these felowes do imagine, that the lawe of god is contented with oute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde or ciuile iustice, they se not that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the true loue of god with all our her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. &amp;c. and that it condempneth al concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in nature. Wherfore no man dothe so moche as the lawe requireth. It is a folyshe thyng therfore to fayne, that we may do more than the lawe requireth.

For the keyes can neyther laye them on, neyther remitte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but god without the ministerie or seruice of the keyes, bothe dothe laye them on, and also remitte them. Neyther doth this vniuersall rule folowe, as to gather in this wyse. Upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dauid was layd a propre punyshement for his offence: ergo be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sydes the comen afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, there is a certeine other payne of Purgatory, in which to euery synne is correspondent a degree of punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Where dothe the scripture teache this, that we can not be delyuered from eternall deathe, but by that recompence of certeyne paynes besydes the comen afflictions? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywyse the scripture dothe often tymes teache, that remission of synnes dothe come freelye for Christis sake / and that Christe is the ouercomer of deathe and of synne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought not to patche vnto him the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And though there be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions left, yet not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng the scripture dothe iudge them to be mortifications of the synne presente, not recompensations of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deathe, or prices of eternall deathe. Iob is excused, that he was not punyshed for his offences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in tymes passed: wherfore
<pb facs="tcp:9761:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
afflictions be not alwayes punyshementes, or tokens of wrathe. But rather frearefull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences be to be taughte, that there be other better endes of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: lest els they myght thynke them selues to be reiected of god, if in afflictions they do se nothynge but punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; the wrathe of god. Other better endꝭ I say are to be consydered, as this ende, that god dothe a nother mannes workes, that he maye do his owne worke. &amp;c. as Esaie dothe teache in a longe sermon.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Esa.</hi> 28.</note> And whan the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples dyd aske Christ, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the blynde man, who had synned: Christe answered, that synne was not the cause of his blyndnes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohan.</hi> 9</note> but that the worke of god myghte be shewed and declared in hym.

As the prophetes were slayne, and Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Baptiste, &amp; other holy men. Wherfore afflictions be not always punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes for certeyn synnes done in tymes past, but they be workes of god appoynted to oure vtilitie and ꝓfite, and that the power of god shulde be the more shewed, and the better sene &amp; knowen in our infirmitie. So Paule sayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The power of god is made perfecte in myn in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmitie and weykenes. Therfore our bodies oughte to be sacrifices or oblations, bicause of goddes wyll and pleasure, to declare oure obedience, and not to make recompense for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall deathe, for whiche god hath a nother price, I meane the deathe of his sonne. And after this sentence &amp; meanyng doth Gregorie interprete also that punyshement of Dauid,<note place="margin">S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorye.</note> whan he sayth, If god for that synne had thre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tened that he shuld be so hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled of his sonne:
<pb facs="tcp:9761:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
why after that the sinne was forgyuen, dyd he fulfylle that, whiche he had thretened? It is answered, that that forgyuenes of synne was done, lest the man shulde be letted to receyue eternall lyfe. And that example of punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thretened dyd folowe, that the holynes of the man also in that humilitie or affliction myght be exercised &amp; ꝓued. So also god dyd laye vpon man deathe of the body, bicause of synne, and after the forgyuenes of synnes, he hath not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away death, for cause of iustice to be exercised, that is to saye, that the iustice myghte be exercised &amp; proued of them, whiche be sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctified. Neyther be the comen calamites and afflictions taken away proprely by those workes of canonicall satisfactions, that is to witte, by those workes of mennes traditions, whiche they do say to be of suche strength, by reason of the worke that is wroughte, that al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit they be done in deadely synne, yet they do redeme paynes. And whan that texte of Paule is alledged, If we wolde iudge our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, we shulde not be iudged and condempned of the lorde: that worde, iudge, ought to be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstanded of the hole repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and of the due frutes, and not of workes, whiche be not due.

The deuisers and chiefe worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maysters of the confutation do wryte, that it is not to be suffered, that satisfactions shulde be taken away, contrary to thexpresse gospel. We therfore hytherto haue shewed howe that those canonicall satisfactions, that is to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> workes not due to be done for the recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of eternal payne, haue not for the main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenaunce of them any warraunt or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the gospell.

For no wyse man wyl greately striue aboute the nombre or the name, so that those thynges be reserued and kepte, whiche haue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundemente of god and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myses of god to maintaine and fortifye them. This thynge is more necessary, to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and knowe howe we ought to vse the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. And here we dampne and vtterly dispraise the hole multitude of scolasticall doctours, whiche teache, that the sacramentes, to hym that putteth no stoppe or impedimente of his owne parte, do giue grace by the vertue of the worke that is wrought, without the good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the harte. This is vtterly a Iudaicall opinion to thynke that we be iustified by a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony without good motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the harte, that is to say, without faythe. And yet neuertheles this wycked and pestilente opinion is taught with greate auctoritie in all the kyngdome of the pope. Paule crieth agaynst it, and denieth that Abraham was iustified by circumcision, and sayeth that circumcision was but a token or signe put forthe to exercise faythe. So we do teache that in the vse of the sacramentes faythe ought to be put vnto whiche dothe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
<pb facs="tcp:9761:138"/>
those promises, &amp; dothe receiue the thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gꝭ promysed, whiche be offred in the sacramente. And the reason to proue it is playne and very stronge whiche is this. The promyse is vnpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable onles it be receiued by faythe / but the sacramentes be signes of the promyses. Ergo in the vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faythe ought to be put vnto. As for example, if any man shal vse the souper of the lorde, let hym so vse it. Because that it is a sacrament of the newe testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as Christ playnly declareth. Therfore lette hym beleue stedfastly that the thingꝭ promised in the newe testament be geuen or offred vnto him, that is to wete free remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of synnes. And this thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g let hym receiue by faythe / let hym comforte &amp; lyfte vp hys fearefull conscience / and let hym thynke these testimonies nat to be deceitfull, but to be so sure and vndoubted as if god with a newe miracle dyd promyse from heuen, that he wyll forgyue. But what shulde these mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and promises auayle, to hym that dothe nat beleue them? And we speke here of special faythe whiche dothe beleue the present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse, and nat only of that faythe, whiche in generall dothe beleue that god is, but whiche dothe beleue that remission of synnes is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Thys vse of sacramente dothe comforte godly and fearefull myndes. But howe great a multitude of abuses haue ben brought vp in the churche through that mad opinion of the work wrought, without the good motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vser, no man can with wordꝭ expresse.

The seconde parte they vtterly condempne, in which we say, that mans traditions instituted to appeace god, to merite grace / and to satisfy for synnes be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the gospell. Albeit in our confession co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the choyse of meares, we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many thynges ynough of traditions: yet this natwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding certayne thingꝭ shal here brefly be repeted. For although we thought, that our aduersaries wolde for other causes defende the traditions of men: yet we dyd nat thynke, that euer they wolde haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempned this our article / whiche is. That we deserue nat forgiuenes of si<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, or grace through the obseruyng of mennes traditions. Syth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thys article is condempned: we haue an easy and a playne cause. Now our aduersaries do openly play the Iewes, and do openly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the gospell with deuillyshe doctrines. For than dothe the scripture call tradicions the doctrines of deuyls: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is taught, that they be seruices profitable to deserue remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of synnes, and grace. For then they endymme the gospel, they minishe the benefite of Christ they annulle the iustice of faythe. The gospel teacheth vs, that we through faythe for Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes sake frely receiue remission of sinnes, and be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to god. Our aduersaries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wyse make another mediatour, that is to wete
<pb facs="tcp:9761:140"/>
these traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For the traditions sake, they wyll obteine remission of sinnes, by these they wyll appease the wrathe of god. But Christe sayth openly, They honour me in vayne with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes of men. We haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before largely disputed, that men be iustified throughe faythe, whan they beleue that they haue god pacified, not for our workes, but fre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye for Christe. This is vndoubtedly the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the gospell, for Paule sayth playnly to the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2</note> Ye be freely saued through faythe, and that not of your selues, it is the gyfte of god, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>methe not of men. Nowe our aduersaries say, that men deserue remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of synnes by these humane obseruaunces. What other thyng is this, than besides Christ to set vp a nother iustifier, a nother mediator? Paule saythe to the Galathians, Ye be fallen from Christ,<note place="margin">Gala. 5</note> ye whiche be iustified by the law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to saye, if ye thynke, that by the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge of the lawe, ye deserue to be accompted ryghtuous in the syght of god: Christe shall nothing auayle you. For wherunto nede they Christ, which thynke them selues to be rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous by theyr owne obseruynge of the lawe? God hath set forthe Christe vnto vs, that for this mediatours sake, and not for our iustices sake, he wyll be mercyfull to vs. But these men thynke, that god is pacified and made mercyfull for our traditions sake and not for Christꝭ sake.

                        </gap>om Christ the honour and prerogatiue of a mediator. Neyther is there any difference betwyxte our traditions, &amp; the ceremonies of Moyses law, as concernynge this matter. Paule therfore condempneth the ceremonies of the lawe of
<pb facs="tcp:9761:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Moyses, lykewyse as he condempneth tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, bicause they were iudged to be workes, whiche dyd merite iustice in the syght of god, by reason wherof the benefite of Christe, and the iustice of faythe were obscured. wherfore he putteth awaye the lawe, he puttethe awaye traditions, and proueth playnlye, that not for these workes sake, but for Christis sake remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of synnes is freelye promysed, so that by faythe we receyue it. For asmoche therfore as by faythe ne receyue remission of synnes / and syth through faythe we haue god mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fauourable to vs for Christis sake, it is playne errour and heresy to decree, that by these obseruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces we deserue remission of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. If any man do here say, that we deserue not by these traditions remission of synnes, but that we being alredy iustified, do by these traditions deserue grace: here agayne Paule cryeth agaynst hym, sayeng that Christ shuld be the minister of synne, if after iustification it were to be thoughte, that afterwardes we be not reputed ryghtuous for Christis sake, but that fyrst we ought by other obseruations to deserue to be reputed ryghtuous. Also to a testament made by man, nothynge ought to be added: Ergo to the testament of god, whiche promysethe that for Christis sake he wyll be mercyfull vnto vs, it oughte not to be added, that fyrste by these obseruations we ought to merite to be reputed acceptable &amp; ryghtuous. Howbeit, wherto nedethe any longe disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? No tradition hath ben instituted by the holy fathers, for this entent, that it shulde me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite forgyuenes of synnes: but they haue ben instituted for cause of good ordre to be had in
<pb facs="tcp:9761:141"/>
the churche, and for cause of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quilitie. And though any man wolde institute certeyn wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to deserue remission of synnes or ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes: howe shall he know that those warkꝭ please god, whan he hath no testimonie or wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the worde of god? Howe shall he make men assured of the wyll of god, withoute the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and worde of god? Dothe not god euerywhere in the prophetes forbydde to institute any peculiar maner of honour or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice without his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement?

For what difference is there? if it hath ben laufull for vs to institute seruices profitable to merite grace or iustice: whye was not the same thynge laufull to the gentyles, and to the chyldren of Israel? But therfore were the honours of the Gentyles and of the Israelites disalowed, because they thought them selues by the sayde honours to merite remission of sinnes and iustice, and dyd not knowe the iustice of fayth. Finally, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be we made sure, that honours or seruices instituted by men, without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of god do iustifie? For of the wyll &amp; pleasure of god, nothynge can be affermed without the worde of god. What if god dothe not accepte

                     <p>And what nede many wordes in a thyng that is manifeste and open?

Also that they be seruices necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to iustification / and that for them men be accompted ryghtuous in the syghte of god.

And certayne kyndes of publike vengeaunce be the iudgementes, ponyshementes, warres, and batayles. Of these thynges, howe euyll many wryters haue iudged, it is euident and playne / for they haue bene in this errour and wronge opinion, that the gospell is a certeyn newe outwarde and monastical pollicie or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre of a comen weale / and they dyd not see, that the gospell dothe brynge eternall iustice to the hertes, and outwardely dothe approue the ciuile estate. This also is a very false lye, that it is christen perfection, not to kepe any thyng propre. For the christen pfection doth not stande in the contempte and despisyng of ciuile ordenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: but in the motions of the harte, in the great feare of god, in great fayth, as Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Dauid, Daniel, euen in those great ryches and empires were no lesse pfecte, than any heremites.

And they adde also more, that remission of synnes and iustification is due of necessitie to suche maner workes. For the hertes of men without the holy ghoste, be without feare of god, without trust towardes god / they do not beleue, that they be herde of god, that theyr synnes be forgyuen, that they be holpen and saued of god. Therfore they be wycked. But so it is, that an euyll tree can not brynge forthe good frutes, And without faythe it is impossible to please god. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although we graunt vnto frewyll libertie and power to worke the outwarde workes of the lawe: yet we graunt not to frewyll power to worke spirituall workes, that is to witte, to drede god truelye, to beleue and truste in god truelye, to decree with it selfe truelye, and to thynke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god dothe loke vpon vs, doth heare vs, dothe forgyue vs. &amp;c.

This fayth, it is an herde thyng euen for holy men also to kepe and holde fast: ergo moche lesse it is in wycked men, and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued (as we sayd before) whan hertꝭ thrugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly made affrayde, do heare the gospell, and do take consolation and conforte.

To this churche of the prophetes let vs assente and agree, rather than to these vngratious writers of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation, whiche so boldely without shame blaspheme Christe.

This faythe holdeth vp, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth hartes in that moste sharpe batayle of desperation.

dyd hange vpon our workꝭ, it shulde nat be firme and stable / if remission of synnes were giuen for our workes, when shulde we knowe, that we had goten remission? when shulde the troubled conscience fynde a worke whiche he were assured to be sufficiente to appease the wrathe of god? But we haue spoken before of the hole matter, and from thens let the reader take testimonies. For the vnworthynes and shamefulnes of the thyng hathe enforced and compelled vs to make thys complaynt and be waylyng rather then a disputation, because in thys place they haue spoken expressly, that they do disalowe our article where we saye, that we obtayne remission of synnes nat for our owne workes, but by faythe and frely for Christes sake.

is to make the cause of that whiche is nat the cause. For Peter speaketh of workꝭ folowyng remission of synnes, and he teacheth wherfore they ought to be done, that is to wete, that the calling myght be sure and stable, that is for to say, that they do nat fal from theyr callyng, if they do syn agayne. Do good workes, that ye may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in your callyng, leaste ye lose the gyftes of callyng which ye had before nat for the workes folowyng, but they be nowe retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and kepte by faythe, and faythe dothe nat abyde in them, which lose the holy ghoste, and whiche do caste away repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as we sayde before, that faythe standeth in repentaunce. They adde other authorities hangynge nat muche better together. And in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion they say, that this opinion was condempned more then a thousande yeres paste in the tyme of Augustine. Thys also is a false lye. For the church of Christ hathe alwayes thought, that remission of synnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth frely. But on the contrary syde the Pelagians were condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whiche dyd stifly affirme,<note n="*" place="margin">The Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>anes.</note> that grace is gy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen for our workes. But we haue shewed suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently here before, that we thinke, that good workes ought of necessitie to folowe faythe. For we do nat (sayeth Paule) take awaye the lawe, but we do establyshe it,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> because syth with faythe we haue receyued the holy ghost, there foloweth necessarily the fulfyllynge of the lawe, whiche dothe continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace more and more, as loue, patience, chastitie, and other frutes of the spirite.</p>

                        </gap>rme this, that the scripture dothe nat teache the inuocation of sayntes, or to desyre helpe of sayntes. But forasmuche as neyther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, neyther promyse, neyther exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of praieng to saintes can be brought or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of the scriptures: it foloweth that the conscience can haue no certayntie ne any assurance concernyng that inuocation. And sythe it is so, that prayer ought to be made with faythe: howe do we knowe, that god doth accepte and allowe that inuocation? Whereby knowe we without the testimonie of scripture, that sayntes do vnderstande and knowe the prayers and petitions of euery particular per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son? Some men do make of the sayntꝭ vtterly very goddes, giuinge vnto them, that they do se the secrete thoughtꝭ of the myndes in vs. They dispute of the morow tyde knowledge, and the euentyde knowlege, peraduenture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do doubte, whether they do heare in the morowtyde, or elles in the euentyde. These thynges they do imagine, not to then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to put the saintes to worshyp: but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende worshypfull gaynes, which come by the worshyppynge of sayntes. Our aduersaries can brynge nothyng agaynst this reason, that in asmoche as inuocation of sayntes hath no testimonie of the worde of god: it can not be affermed, that sayntꝭ do vnderstande &amp; knowe our inuocation &amp; prayer / or thoughe they do knowe it neuer so moche, that god dothe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe it. Wherfore our aduersaries ought not
<pb facs="tcp:9761:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to compell vs to a thyng vncerteine &amp; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For prayer without faythe is no prayer. For as for thexample of the churche, whiche they do alledge: it is vndoubtedlye knowen that this is a newe maner and custome in the churche. For the olde prayers or collectes, although they make mention of sayntes: yet do they not praye to the sayntes. Howe be it this newe inuocation also in the churche, is farre vnlyke the inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche euery man vseth priuately.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore oure aduersaries not onelye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire inuocation in the honouryng of sayntꝭ, but also they do applye the merites of sayntꝭ for other men, and do make of the saintes not only intreaters or intercessours, but also mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cygrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tours or propitiatours. This is in no wyse to be suffred. For here the honoure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely due vnto Christe, is vtterly taken from hym, &amp; gyuen to the sayntes. For they make the saintes mediatours and mercy graunters. And albeit they make a distinction betwyxte mediatours of intercession,<note place="margin">A distin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</note> and mediatours of rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption: yet for al that they make plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the saintes mediatours or meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And agayne they haue no testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of scripture for them, that sayntes be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours of intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. which worde though it be spoken moste shamefastly &amp; measurably: yet neuertheles it dothe obscure and deface the benefite of Christe / and it translateth the truste of mercy due to Christ, vnto the sayntꝭ. For men do fayne and imagine, that Christ is more harde to entreate, and that sayntes be more gentle and easie to please, and they trust more on the mercy of sayntꝭ than on the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye
<pb facs="tcp:9761:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Christe / and fleinge from Christe, they seke to the sayntes. So they make of them in very dede mediatours of redemption. Therfore we shal shewe, that they make vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of sayntes not only deprecatours, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatours, that is to saye, mediatours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We do not yet recite here the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the comen people / we do yet speake of the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of lerned men. The rest euen the vnlerned may iudge. In a propitiatour these two thynges muste co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre &amp; runne together. Fyrst there must be the worde of god, by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we may knowe assuredly, that god is wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge to haue mercye, and to heare those that call on hym, for this propitiatours sake. Suche maner ꝓmyse is there made of Christ, What soeuer ye shal aske my father i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my name he shall gyue it you. Of the sayntes there is no suche maner promyse. wherfore conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can not certaynly decree with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, that we be herde by the inuocation of sayntꝭ. wherfore that inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not made through faythe. Furthermore we haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we shulde call vpon Christe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to that texte, <hi>Come vnto me all ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: &amp;c.</hi> whiche doubtles was sayd also to vs. And the prophete Esaie saythe,<note place="margin">Esa. 9.</note> In that daye shall the roote of Iesse stande as a marke and signe to the people / hym shall the gentyles praye and beseche.

The seconde thyng that belongeth to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiator or mercy gyuer is that his merites be set forthe, as whiche be gyuen to other men by goddꝭ imputation, so that for them they be reputed ryghtuous, as it were for theyr owne merities. As for example, if one frende doth pay anothers debtes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the detter is delyuered by another mans merite, as though it were by his owne. So the merites of Christ be gyuen to vs, that we myght be reputed rightuous by the trust of the merites of Christ, whan we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in hym, as though we had merites of our owne. And of both these two, that is to wit, of the promyse, and of the gyuyng of merites, there rysethe truste of mercye. Suche maner truste of goddes promyse, and also of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christe, ought to be brought with vs whan we entende to praye.

                     <p>Here our aduersaries hyd vs fyrste to call v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon sayntes, where as they haue neyther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse of god, neyther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, neyther example of the scripture.

But experience teacheth that by the comon persuation, the blessed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine is vtterly come in to Christis stede / her men haue called vpon, and prayed vnto / vpon her grace and mercy they haue trusted / by her they wolde pacifie Christe, as though he were not a mercy gyuer, but onely a terrible iudge, and an aduenger. But surely we thynke, that we be iustified only by truste of the merites of Christe, and not by trust of the merites of the blessed virgine, or of other sayntes. Of other sayntes it was sayde, Euery one shall receyue theyr rewarde, accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to theyr labour, that is to saye, they can not amonge them selues gyue theyr meritꝭ one to another / so as freers and other religious men do selle the merites

euen the most knowen &amp; euident abuses. So disceytfully is the confutation made, not onely in this place, but almoste euerywhere. There is no place, in which they do discerne the manifest abuses from their decrees and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. And yet amonge them selues, if any be wyser than other, they do graunte, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false persuations do stycke in the doctrine of schole men &amp; canonistes, and besydes this that many abuses haue cropen in to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, throughe the greate ignoraunce and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of pastors and curates. For Luther was not the fyrste, whiche complayned of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen abuses. Many ryghte connynge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men haue longe before these dayes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and bewayled the abuses of the masse / the truste in the obseruaunces of monkes and freers / the gaynfull worshyppynge of sayntꝭ / the confuse darkenes of the doctrine of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce / whiche ought to be euen most playne and open of all other in the churche.

And yet amonge these, the olde men be more nere to the scripture, than the wryters of late tyme. So the diuinitie of them hath thus gone out of kynde more and more. Neyther was there any other cause to many good men, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ganne to loue Luther at the begynnyng: then that they sawe hym to rydde and delyuer the myndes of men from those endeles mases of mooste confuse and enuegeled disputations / whiche be amonge the schole diuines and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonistes,

But our aduersaries go not aboute to helpe and further the most honeste and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entente and purpose of themperoure: but that they maye oppresse vs by all maner mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Many euidente tokens shewe, that for the churche they take lytle thoughte. They gyue no diligence, that the people maye haue amonge them some certeyn fourme of decrees and opinions in the churche.

What they entende by these thyngꝭ good men maye easelye iudge. But by this waye they neyther ꝓuyde well for theyr owne kyngdome, neyther yet for the churche. For wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good teachers be burned and slayne, and the true doctrine is oppressed: afterward there shall ryse madde and frantike persones, whom our aduersaries shall not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, whiche shall trouble the churche with wycked opinions, and shall ouerthrowe the hole ordre of the Churche, whiche we desyre very greately to conserue and kepe.

The sacramente was instituted to comforte &amp; lyfte vp troubled and feared myndes, when they be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue, that the flesshe of Christe, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the lyfe of the worlde, is meate / &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they beleue, that they ioyned to Christe be quickened.

Many heretikꝭ throughe the mysunderstandynge of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd lawe of Moyses, haue had contumelious and shamefull opinions of wedlocke.

yet they dyd dysprayse it, as a kynde of lyui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, whiche scarcely at any tyme dothe please god or at the leaste wyse shulde nat please god but only because of procreation. But single lyfe they dyd extolle and magnifie as an angelical kynde of liuing. This they preached to be the moste pleasaunte sacrifice vnto god, to merite remission of synnes / to merite garlondes or crownes / to brynge forthe the hundreth folde frute and other thinges out of nombre. These religions of aungelles Paule dothe greately improue wryting to the Collossians. For they do oppresse the knoweledge of Christe, when men do thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke, that they be reputed ryghtuous for suche maner obseruaunces, and nat for Christꝭ sake / they oppresse also the knowlege of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mauddementes of god, whan besides the preceptꝭ of god newe ceremonies and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices be deuised, and preferred before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And it maye be so, that the herte of a maryed man, as of Abraham, or of Iacob, whiche had many wyues, is more cleane, and doth lesse brenne with wanton lustes, than the hertes of many virgines, yea whiche do lyue chaste in very dede.

This faythe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth &amp; lyfteth vp co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trite &amp; troubled myndꝭ. And lyke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wise as the worde was gyuen to styrre vp this faythe: So the sacrament was ordeyned for this entente, that the visible signe sette forthe vnto the iye shuld moue the hertes to beleue.

And suche maner vse of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whan fayth quickeneth troubled and feareful hertes, is a sacrifice of the newe testamente. For the newe testamente hath spirituall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that is to say, mortification, and viuifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And to this vse dyd Christe institute it, whan he byddethe vs do it for a memoriall and remembraunce of hym. For to remembre Christe is no vayne or ydle celebration of the sighte or shewe, or instituted onely for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, as we se in tragedies, the memorye of Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les or Ulisses to be honourablye made: But it is to remembre the benefites of Christ, and to receiue them by fayth, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may be quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by them. Therfore the psalme saythe. A memorie hath the most merciful lorde made of his merueiles / he hath gyuen meate to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that feare hym. For he signifieth &amp; meaneth, that the wyll and mercye of god shulde be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged
<pb facs="tcp:9761:191"/>
in that ceremonie. But faythe, whiche knowlegeth &amp; confesseth mercy, doth vndoubtedlye make a lyue. And this is the principall vse of the sacrament, wherby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth who be mete and conuenient persones to this sacramente (that is to witte, troubled consciences and throughlye made affrayde) and also howe they ought to vse the same. There is put to also a sacrifice, for there be many endes of one thyng. After that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science lyfted vp and conforted with faythe, hath felte and perceyued oute of what maner feares it is delyuered: than verely it truelye gyueth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes for the benefite and passion of Christe / and dothe vse the ceremonie to the laude &amp; prayse of god, to thende that by this obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it may shewe due kyndnes / and may knowledge it selfe to esteme greatly the gyftꝭ of god. So the ceremonie is made a sacrifice of prayse.

Sythe than it is so, that not so moche as by the workes of goddꝭ law, we can merite remission of sinnes, or eternall lyfe, but it is necessary to seke the mercy promysed in Christ: moche lesse is suche honour to be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Monasticall obseruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces (seinge theyr be nothynge elles but traditions of men) that they shulde deserue remission of synnes or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall lyfe.

But our aduersaries wolde full wylyly seme to moderate the comen ꝑsuasion of pefection.

It is wryten that to Antony,<note place="margin">An hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of saynte Antony</note> when he desyred of god to knowe howe muche he had profyted in this kynde of lyuynge, there was shewed in his dreame a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne shomaker dwellyng in the citie of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrie, to whom he was compared.

When he had spoken with the man: he hearith nothynge of hym, but that he dyd euery mornynge in fewe wordes pray for the hole citie, and afterwardꝭ dyd applye his crafte and occupation. Here Antony perceiued, that iustification is nat to be imputed to that sorte of lyuing, whiche he had taken vpon hym and professed. But our aduersaries, although they now moderate the prayses of perfection: yet in very dede they thynke otherwyse. For they sell merites, and apply them for other: vndre this prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that they obserue bothe the preceptes and also the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sayles.

But they busye them selues all together, eyther in philosophicall disputations, or in traditions of ceremonies, whiche do obscure &amp; mynyshe the honour of Christ. We wyll not here speke of all that holle pompe of ceremonies, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges, of syngynges, and semblable thyngꝭ, whiche myghte be suffered, if they were taken for exercises, so as lessons be in the scholes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of whiche is to teache the hearers, and in teachi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to styrre them to feare, or to fayth.

For they for the same ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t encrease these ceremonies. That if they dyd take these ceremonies vpon them, to teache &amp; exhorte the hearers: shorte &amp; pyked lessons shulde do more good, than those infinite and endles bablynges. So all the hole lyfe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men is full of hypocrisye, and of false opinions. Besydes this there is another ieopardie, and that is this, that they, whiche be in those Monasteries be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to assent &amp; agree vnto them, whiche psecute the truthe. There be therfore many wayghtie and greate reasons, whiche delyuer good men from this kynde of lyuynge.</p>

consciences, so that it shulde be iudged synne to leaue them vndone: our aduersaries shall neuer be able to proue, that byshops haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and auctoritie to institute suche honours and seruices.</p>
                     <p>But what power the gospell dothe gyue to byshoppes we haue shewed in our confession. They whiche de byshoppes nowe a dayes, do nat execute the offices of byshops according to the gospell: but they be byshoppes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the policie and ordenaunce in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones / which we do nat rebuke: But we speke of a bysshop accordyng to the rule of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.<note n="*" place="margin">The olde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of power.</note> And that olde diuision of power / into power of ordre, and power of iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sith vs verie wel. The bysshop therfore hathe power of ordre, that is the ministration of the worde and of sacramentꝭ. He hath also power of iurisdiction (that is to say) auctoritie to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>communicate those that haue committed open crymes / and agayne auctoritie to assoile them if they wyll conuert &amp; desyre absolution. But neyther haue they tyrannicall power (that is to say) without any certayne lawe / but they haue a certayne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, I meane, the vndoubted worde of god, whiche they oughte to teache / and accordyng to it to vse theyr iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. Wherfore it folowith nat, although they haue some iurisdiction, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute newe honours and seruices.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, howe farre forthe they ought to excercise theyr iurisdiction / whiche is, if any man haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted and trespassed agaynst the worde, whiche they haue receiued of Christe.
<pb facs="tcp:9761:211"/>
Howbeit in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession we haue added also, howe farre forthe it is laufull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make traditions / that is to wete, nat as necessary seruices, but that there myght be an ordre in the churche because of tranquilitie. And these ought nat to bynde and entangle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences, as though they dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde necessarie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and seruices / as Paule teachith when he sayeth.<note place="margin">Gala. 5.</note> Stande faste in the libertie, in whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che Christe hathe deliuered you / and be nat brought agayne vnder the yoke of bondage. The vse therfore of suche ordinations ought to be lefte free (so that we auoyde the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of our bretherne) leaste they myght els be iudged to be necessary seruices. And so dyd the apostles them selues / they ordeined many thynges, whiche afterwardes in processe of time were chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged. Neyther did they in suche wyse ordeyne the sayde traditions, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it myght nat be laufull to chaunge them. For they dyd nat disagre from theyr owne writyngꝭ, in whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they labour very greatly that this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shulde nat oppresse the church, that humayne rytes and ceremonies be necessary seruices. This is the simple and playne maner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretynge traditions (that is to wete) to knowe that they be no necessary seruices, and yet that we obserue and kepe them, when we se opportunitie, without superstition to auoyde the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of our bretherne. And this hath ben the mynde of many ryght connynge and excellent men in the churche. Neyther we se what can be brought agaynste it. For this is vndoubted, that the sentence of Christe. <hi>Qui uos audit me audit.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luc. 10</note> that is to saye. Whosoeuer hearith you hearith me / dothe nat speake of

traditions / but it maketh moste agaynst tradi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions. For it is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, but a wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes gyuen to the apostles, that we shulde giue credence to them of another mannes worde. For Christe wolde confirme and strengthe vs (as nede was to do) that we shulde knowe, that the worde taught by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was of force and strengthe / and that we shulde nat nede to seke for any other worde from heuen, but it can nat be vnderstonded of traditions. For Christe requirith that they shulde so teache: that he myght be herde / for he sayeth (he hearith me) He wyll therfore, that his worde, &amp; his voyce be herde, and nat humaine traditions. So the sayeng that makith moste for vs, and contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith moste graue consolation and doctrine: these Asses do wreste and apply to moste tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felynge thynges / I meane to the choyse and diuersitie of meates, varietie of clothyng, and se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blable thyngꝭ.
