         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>AS want of Coin did ſtore of Banks beget;</l>
            <l>So Poets ſwarm upon this Dearth of Wit.</l>
            <l>And as thoſe Banks, when ready Caſh grew ſcant,</l>
            <l>Excus'd non-payments by the publick want:</l>
            <l>Ill Poets ſo, when you on them reflect,</l>
            <l>Their proper Faults upon the Times reject.</l>
            <l>Shoals of damn'd Play-wrights in our Pits are found</l>
            <l>Like Brother Bankrupts for each other bound;</l>
            <l>Who, ſinking firſt themſelves beneath the Teſt,</l>
            <l>With joint Endeavour ſtrive to damn the reſt:</l>
            <l>And, having fail'd to ſatisfie the Town,</l>
            <l>Turn Levellers and cry all credit down.</l>
            <l>Fools, French-men, Players, fill the crouded Pit,</l>
            <l>Thoſe ſworn Confederates to write down Wit.</l>
            <l>Inſtead of Manly ſenſe, and ſtrong writ Plays,</l>
            <l>They bring you <hi>Harlequin,</hi> and <hi>Opera</hi>'s.</l>
            <l>They let you thus, like Children, have your will,</l>
            <l>Knowing how fond you are of Rattles ſtill.</l>
            <l>Theſe Practices on us have brought ſuch Ills,</l>
            <l>That half our Cuſtomers proteſt our Bills;</l>
            <l>And our Receipts of late to leſs amount</l>
            <l>Than formerly by double Bank diſcount.</l>
            <l>Our young Beginner, fearing this to day,</l>
            <l>Offers Security for his firſt Play.</l>
            <l>To raiſe his Stock he wiſe proviſion made,</l>
            <l>Of a rich Partner to ſupport the Trade:</l>
            <l>Whoſe viſible Eſtate, and Credit yet</l>
            <l>Make his Bills current through the Land of Wit,</l>
            <l>Which upon ſight, if any doubt be made</l>
            <l>In ſpecie ſhall in new mill'd Wit be paid.</l>
            <l>For like our Mints, our Scribler has made bold,</l>
            <l>To make all new by melting down the Old.</l>
            <l>Nor can you blame him, if he has the Skill,</l>
            <l>But to maintain the Ancient Standard ſtill;</l>
            <l>For, what he finds in weight deficient grown,</l>
            <l>He will make good with Bullion of his own.</l>
            <l>Thus much he thought was to the Criticks due:</l>
            <l>Next comes his Complement fair Sex to you.</l>
            <l>He wou'd not raiſe your Bluſhes by his Play,</l>
            <l>Nor ſuffer Scandal on the Stage to day.</l>
            <l>On Knaves alone at preſent he makes War;</l>
            <l>For only ſuch are brought unto the Bar:</l>
            <l>And yet the Fool did the whole City ſpare.</l>
            <l>Like running Traders thus he does begin,</l>
            <l>By courteous dealing firſt to draw you in.</l>
            <l>If to his word this time you find him juſt,</l>
            <l>It may encourage you to greater Truſt.</l>
            <l>Next time perhaps alone He'l undertake,</l>
            <l>And by your Favours in your Debts may break.</l>

Court, than my Lord is. Who Powders, or Eſſences higher? Who dreſſes,
or dances better? Who Sings, Fences, or Vaults finer than he? Then he's as
Proper, a well-ſet Man as e're you ſaw, and as fit for a Ladies Service;
'twould do your heart good to ſee him a Horſe-Back, he ſits ſo gracefully in
the Saddle.</p>

            <l>For well he knows 'em to be Birds of Prey.</l>
            <l>To you, ſweet Beaus, he fain wou'd ſomething leave,</l>
