            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Poor Man's Propoſal,</hi> To Supply the MINT, AND Prevent Counterfeiting the COYN when Mended.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Humbly conceive that any Propoſal for Supplies, that may be both Effectual and Expeditious, will be very Acceptable; and if you would not hear of the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Taxes, they ſhould be laid where Men are able to pay them; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not only the neceſſity of the Caſe, but the Grandeur of the Nation, will make that Tax eaſie, that hath ſuch Properties. And farther, the Addreſſes to ſome of the Worthy Members, by their Repreſentatives, that they would raiſe their Supplies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, might embolden me to hint ſomething of this nature; for I humbly conceive there can be no Tax laid, but will be in ſome caſes Oppreſſive, but what I am now about to offer, if it be in any caſe hard, it will moſt certainly fall upon the Rich; and although theſe be the Perſons that muſt make our Laws, and raiſe the Taxes, yet ſince they would have the word <hi>Effectual</hi> put into Their Addreſs, I do not doubt, but they will (more than in Words) raiſe Effectual Supplies. Which I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive may in part be done, by laying a Tax upon all Plate in this Nation, both in uſe, and out of uſe; and not only what is made, but what ſhall be made for Seven Years to come; or ſo long as the War ſhall continue.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing there be but Eight Millions worth of Plate, this at Six-pence <hi>per</hi> Ounce, will raiſe 800000 <hi>l.</hi> but if it ſhould raiſe but 600000 <hi>l.</hi> and bring 2000000 <hi>l.</hi> of Silver to be Coyned, I hope it would be a very neceſſary Tax at this time, and if you think fit to double the Tax upon all Plate uſed in Publick Houſes, and to lay an Impoſition upon all Bullion to be Exported out of the Nation, and the Reſiners to pay for what they uſe, it might add much to the Sum that would be raiſed hereby.</p>
            <p>The Propoſal above having been offer'd on the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> to a worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Houſe, and ſince hearing of no more effectual means than this, I thought good to make it more Publick, by Printing of it, with ſome Additions, to prevent the Counterfeiting our Coyn when Mended.</p>
            <p>The Deficiency of our Coyn, was a thing ſo noto<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ous, that I cannot but highly approve of your Reſolve, to reſtore it to its former Value.</p>
            <p>The Methods whereby this Evil was brought upon us, need not ſo much as to be hinted. But if I can ingage the <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> themſelves, and all the <hi>Bankers</hi> to watch againſt the Counterfeiting of it for the future, I hope this will be a Means (<hi>Effectually</hi>) to prevent the like miſchief; which if laying a Penalty of Forfeiture of Eſtate, and the Eſtate of the next Heir, upon any Perſon that ſhall be found Guilty, will not do, I doubt not but making of it Penal for every Perſon that ſhall Vent it, will make every one Careful of whom they Receive their Monys, and if Bad, they muſt either Return it in ſuch a Time, or elſe in ſuch a Time Swear, whom they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it of, and they ſhall be obliged, not only to make it good to the Perſon that Received it, (and have it defaced before the Juſtice of Peace,) but ſhall pay .. — to the Poor, and the Juſtice to Record it, and every Quarter Seſſions Examine who are Common Venters of Bad Mony, and Proceed againſt them accordingly; and if any Perſon for the Future ſhall Preſume to Coin any Bad Monys, this will be a Means to make it Sink in their hands, or at leaſt they will Run more Risk then the Profit will Countervail, Yea, were it Poſſible, to Corrupt the <hi>Mint</hi> it ſelf, this would certainly diſcover them.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be willing to anſwer ſuch Objections that may be raiſed; and might ſay much more to Recommend this, but ſubmit all to your Wiſdom.</p>
