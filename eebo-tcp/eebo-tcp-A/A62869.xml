            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The reason of this writing is rendred.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere came newly to my hands a
Pamphlet, wherein the Intitler
speaks like a vain braggadochio,
as if the book had ript up the
Anabaptists (as he terms them)
and like a Prelate had silenced
them, though there was but one
whom with any face it could be
pretended that he was anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
or silenced, who yet speaks
and writes for the truth, which
these Opponents do endeavour to disgrace, and rejoiceth that he
lives to find that these men have no other thing to charge him with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118327:3"/>
than his contending for a reformation of that prophane abuse of
infant-sprinkling, and that they have no other encouragement from
him to persist in their Paedobaptism, but a fond hope of his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to that sinful practice. The Libel hath a Frontispice, which
pretends to shew the manner of the Anabaptists dipping, but most
falsly, sith it represents it to the eyes of the Beholders as if they
held persons by the heels when they baptize them, which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than their practice. The pretended manner of Laying on of
hands, and Washing of feet, is unknown to me, if they do
use it, yet they have such likely proofs from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. and our
Saviours practice and command <hi>John</hi> 13. as might have deterred
the Author of this Frontispice from exposing the ordinance of
Baptism, and those other rites, to contempt, had he any reverence
to holy things, and regard to Chrisis appointment. But the
Frontispice of Dr. <hi>Featlies</hi> book, and this, with the Epistles and
other passages, do give occasion to intelligent persons to conceive
that this sort of men do make but a sport of Christs Ordinance,
and that they have little mind to search for, or receive truth, but
to expose them that are for believers baptism, and against infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkling,
to the contempt of light and profane wits, and to the
hatred of the ignorant and superstitious common people. And
I conceive that this book is published by men of that spirit, who
seek to make odious the endeavoured reformation of ignorance,
superstition, profanenesse, and ungodliness, which abounds in
those parts, and to uphold those either loose or formal pretended
Ministers, who take upon them to teach, but do indeed, as <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
the Sorcerer <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>pervert the right way of the Lord.</hi>
Surely did they seek the truth in love, they would not so insult
over tender consciences as they do, encourage the looser sort, and
deter the enquiring souls from the wayes of Christ, For my self,
as I have found from others, so I deprehend in these men the same
unrighteous spirit, in their reporting my answers, and publishing
them in print, without my revising of them, though it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and as I remember yielded, by one, that in a private way, I
should have his arguments sent to me in writing, &amp; for the other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
2 Copies of his Sermon sent me, yet I wrote to know whether
he would own them, nor did publish any thing though I had sent
some animadversions on the notes I received, of which I was told
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118327:3"/>
one copy was shewed to Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> himself, and not disowned
by him. And I do account it a shameful practice which these
men, and another before have used towards me, that after I have
been drawn to a verbal extemporary dispute, and no common
notary agreed on, yet my answers are published by them without
ever allowing me the sight of them, that I might either own
them or amend them, afore the printing and publishing them.
But I see, faction so prevails with them, that like as if they were of
the <hi>Romanists</hi> minds, they allow themselves liberty to use any arts
as pious frauds to bear down the truth of Antipaedobaptism. And
this they do with so much insolency as may stir up the inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to trample upon their Antagonist, and create prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the truth. Which hath necessitated me in this hast to write
this.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A view of the Epistles is taken.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHo the <hi>J. T. P.</hi> or <hi>J. W.</hi> is I know not. What the
first Epistle saith of <hi>Austins</hi> rule, it is neither true, for
then the observation of an <hi>Easter,</hi> and sundry other superstitious
rites should be from the Apostles, nor if it were true, is it true
of infant-sprinkling that the whole Church held it, sprinkling
being not used in sundry ages instead of baptism, and infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
as it is now used, opposed by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Gregory
Nazianzen,</hi> and only the Popish doctrine (disclaimed by Mr.
<hi>Cragg</hi>) of the necessity of baptizing infants to their inheriting
heaven, taught by the writers called Fathers. As false it is that
the baptizing believers (called by these Anabaptism) <hi>had its
spring and rise from Nicolas Stork,</hi> and others there named, it
being commanded by Christ, practiced by the Apostles, continued
in the first ages without any infant-baptism, and when infants
were baptized, it was very rarely, onely in case of danger of the
neernesse of death to the infant, and when reformation of other
Popish abuses was sought, the reformation of this was sought with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118327:4"/>
the first, some hundreds of years afore <hi>Luther.</hi> As vain is the
assignation of the causes of Anabaptism (which is indeed true
baptism) whereas the true cause is the shining forth of light from
the Scriptures, and other Authors, not discerned formerly as
now.</p>
               <p>The true reason why our books and practice are permitted is,
because they have at least so much appearance of truth as is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to make wise men to let them alone, lest they haply should fight
against God. The Epistlers reasons are but his own ignorant sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
               <p>Though disputes are useful, yet such unworthy artifices as I
find in and after them are a just reason for me to wave them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with such men as I have met with. What the successe
hath been of the disputes mentioned its not so proper to me to
enquire. The publishing of that at <hi>Bewdley</hi> in so unbrotherly
manner, hath, I imagine, diverted many from the truth, who if
they had not been willing to be deluded, had never been caught
with such a cheat as is the mock-titled book, <hi>Plain Scripture
proof for infant-baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rest of the disputes have not gained (that I hear) any credit
to Paedobaptism, but on the contrary, among the intelligent. It
is true I was importuned to visit some friends at <hi>Abergaveny,</hi> and
did preach there, and some of the things the letter mentions I
spake, and do still avouch.</p>
               <p>The two men mentioned were unknown to me, I slighted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though being wearied with preaching I did forbear to speak
much, and was willing to get into a dry house from the rain. I
was willing to have conference with Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> who seemed
modest and intelligent. The other Opponent I found before to
be a man of talk, who could not blush.</p>
               <p>That which the second Epistle writes of my being <hi>wounded,</hi>
and <hi>vaunting,</hi> is meerly fabulous, and I think the like of the short
time of conceiving the Dispute and Sermon. It displeaseth me
not, that the <hi>business should be truly stated,</hi> which is the end of
this writing, though it displease me that such unworthy tricks are
used to deceive people, as those which appear in the publishing
this Disputation and Sermon. I intend not to lengthen the
businesse by insisting on the falsity of the reports of my Answer:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118327:4"/>
It is not improbable I might in five hours dispute with one who
talked so fast as to give no time to consider of what he said, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
not so cleerly as I would, had I had the arguments to view
and examine deliberately. I presume it will be sufficient, for cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truth, if either I shew how my Answers are misreported, or how
they are to be amended.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> dispute is answered.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO begin with Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> dispute. Had it been framed
into a Syllogism it had been thus. <hi>They that were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
lawfully into the Covenant of grace by Circumcision, may
be admitted into the Covenant of grace by Baptism; But infants
were admitted lawfully into the covenant of grace by Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
Therefore they may be lawfully admited into the covenant
of grace by Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which had it been thus formed I should have said.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is false that either by circumcision or baptism in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
or other persons are admitted into the Covenant of Grace, yea
Paedobaptists themselves suppose they are in the Covenant of
Grace before, and therefore they are baptized: Nor doth Mr.
<hi>Vaughan</hi> shew how persons may be in Congruous sense said to be
admitted into the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were true, yet it is certain that infants of unbelievers
were admitted by circumcision as well as infants of believers, and
so his <hi>medium</hi> proves as well the baptizing of unbelievers infants
taken into a believers house, as believers. But in the manner he
framed his reason I denied the consequence.</p>
               <p>And when he urged, <hi>it must be either because the Covenant
of grace made with</hi> Abraham <hi>and his seed, is not the same in
substance, withthat which is now actually in force with believers &amp;
their children, or secondly because baptism succeedeth not in the
room of circumcision,</hi> I did rightly say I could deny your division.
For there is another reason, <hi>viz.</hi> because there is not the same
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118327:5"/>
command of baptizing infants as there was of circumcising them,
and yet that the disputation might proceed, I denyed the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
for both those reasons.</p>
               <p>And to what was replyed I answered rightly, that the Covenant
now in force according to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 14. was not to the natural seed
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the spiritual; nor is it true, <hi>That all the children
of</hi> Abraham <hi>were circumcised,</hi> for the females were not, or
that <hi>They that were circumcised were consequently admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Covenant.</hi> For even Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> presently tells us, <hi>That</hi>
Ishmael <hi>though circumcised belonged not to the promise.</hi> Now
what is it to be admitted into the Covenant, but to be admitted to
the promise or participation of the Covenant? what he replyed
further, <hi>That the Covenant</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>was made alike, in the
same extent and latitude, promiscuously with all the seed of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
even the natural, is most palpably false. For none
but the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by believing, as he did, have
the promise of righteousness, which is the covenant of grace, and
<hi>Ishmael</hi> is expiesly excluded <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 19, 20, 21. and he grants
himself, <hi>None but the children of</hi> Isaac <hi>were children of the
promise,</hi> nor were the Jewes, who were broken off because of
their own unbelief, <hi>Romans</hi> 11. 20. comprehended in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace. <hi>Romans</hi> 9. 8. proves cleerly that the Covenant
made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed as it was a covenant of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
grace was not made to all his natural seed, and so not to any
of his natural seed, because they were by natural generation of him,
but because elect of God.</p>
               <p>And it is false which Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> saith, <hi>The children of</hi> Isaac
(he should have said <hi>Isaac,</hi> and after him <hi>Jacob</hi>) <hi>are not called
children of the promise in regard of any peremptory election, or
aesignation to faith and salvation.</hi> For the contrary is manifest
from <hi>verses</hi> 11, 12, 13. Nor is it any thing contrary to the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
decree of reprobation, that <hi>Paul</hi> lamented, desired and
prayed for the <hi>Israelites,</hi> but his lamentation doth rather prove
it that they were rejected, and desires and prayers may be even
for that which may not be, as when Christ prayed to have the cup
passe from him. His reasons why the children of <hi>Isaac</hi> are called
children of the promise, are not to his purpose but against him.</p>
               <p n="1">For 1. He doth thereby tacitly imply that none but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118327:5"/>
of <hi>Isaac</hi> were children of the promise, and therefore none but
they in the Covenant of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the reasons of the children of <hi>Isaac</hi> their being called
children of the promise were the inheritance of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the
descent of Christ, then only <hi>Jacob</hi> was a child of the promise,
not <hi>Esau,</hi> and so it remains, the Covenant <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. was not
made to all the circumcised, nor they by circumcision admitted
into the Covenant <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. After his explication, it is cleer that the Covenant of grace
made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed is not the same in substance
with that which is now actually in force with believers and their
children, contrary to what he said before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After this doctrine none are now children of the promise,
sith there are none that inherit <hi>Canaan</hi> according to that promise,
nor from whom Christ descends, and then if the promise be
the same with the covenant of grace, none are now admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same Covenant, and consequently none to be baptized,
according to Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> reasoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What he saith he might have added,</hi> That if none but the
elect and faithful can be admitted into the Covenant, there is
no subject left for the ordinance of baptism.</p>
               <p>I deny it. It goes upon this mistake, that none are to be
admitted but those that are admitted into the Covenant of grace,
and known to be so: Whereas persons that are disciples and
believers by profession at least, are to be admitted to baptism,
and no other ordinarily, whether they be admitted into the
Covenant of Grace, or not. Nor are we to baptize upon
<hi>A judgement of Charity, of thinking no evil,</hi> for then we
must baptize <hi>Turks</hi> infants as well as Christians, nor upon
a faith in the seed, or the parents actual faith, but their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p>It is not true, no not according to Mr. <hi>Vaughan's</hi> own grant,
<hi>that they were admitted into the same Covenant by Circumcision,
into which we are now admitted by Baptism,</hi> For we are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into that Covenant which hath the Promise of the inheriitng
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and descent of Christ from us, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
acknowledged to be promised in the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Neither need we say, that <hi>the circumcised had the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118327:6"/>
of faith inherently in themselves, or that of their Parents
imputed to them, or that Circumcision was a false seal.</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it said <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. of any mans Circumcision but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
in his own person, nor of his, that it was the seal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of faith to any but a believer. This was my answer, not
as Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> mistook me, that Circumcision was a seal onely of
<hi>Abrahams</hi> own faith in particular. Nor is there a word <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 177. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. to prove that <hi>the Covenant or Promise
was the same, and alike, to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his seed, and to us belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and to our children.</hi> Nor is it true that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. is meant of
covenant holiness of children, nor doth he bring any proof that it is
so. For that which he dictates, that <hi>there is certainly some special</hi>
privilege set forth to the children of believers, accruing to them
<hi>from believing Parents,</hi> is false, the Text ascribing nothing to the
faith of the one Parent, but to the conjugal relation. And for that
which he saith, <hi>it was no news to tell them that they might have
the lawfull use one of another,</hi> I say, though they might not doubt
whether they might lawfully use one another when both were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
yet it is manifest the believer doubted whether it might
be so still, and therefore the Apostles telling them it might, was an
apposite resolution of their doubt, whether it be to be called <hi>news</hi>
or no: and their not doubting of the legitimation of their issue is
the very Reason from whence the Apostle by an Argument <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>
infers, the continuance of their lawfull copulation. And
what I said of the use of the words sanctified and holy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 5. 1 <hi>Thess</hi> 4 3 4 7. was right; nor do I think Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi>
would have urged that Text, as he doth, if he had read what I have
written in the first part of my <hi>Antipaedobaptism,</hi> in which is an
ample disquisition of the meaning of that Text, to which I refer
Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and other Readers, who shall be willing to search
out the truth.</p>
               <p>What I said, that if Baptism succeeded Circumcision, and thence
infant-baptism be deduced, female infant-baptism could not be
thence inferred, for they were not circumcised, is manifest, nor is it
pertinent which Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> brings to infringe it. For though
<hi>Females be granted to be in the Covenant of Circumcision,</hi> yet
they were not circumcised, and if <hi>in the eys of all Laws whatsoever
women are but as ignoble creatures,</hi> and so not circumcised, this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118327:6"/>
confirms what I allege, that by virtue of Baptisms succession to
Circumcision their Baptism cannot be inferred. What he <hi>thought
to have told me about the Proselites of Righteousness, and the
baptizing of their Infants,</hi> I conceive I have considered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in the second part of my <hi>Antipaedobaptism</hi> or <hi>Full Review,</hi>
now in the Press, in which the feebleness of Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Proof
is shewed.</p>
               <p>It is neither true that <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. is <hi>an explanation of what is
meant by the circumcision of Christ, in these words, being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him in baptism</hi> nor <hi>any thing said of the analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
circumcision and baptism,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> saith <hi>is
so evident in this place,</hi> nor if it were doth it prove that our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
succeeds the Jewish circumcision. And what he grants,
that <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4, 5. <hi>Immersion and emersion in Baptism
are alluded to, as the custom then of baptizing</hi>; and that which
he saith, <hi>that indeed it seemed to him that for some centuries of
years, that Baptism was practiced by plunging; for sprinkling was
brought first in use by occasion of the</hi> Chinicks, taking what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is manifest, and not denied, that sprinkling is not baptizing but
rantizing, it is manifest that in infant-sprinkling now in use there is
a mockery, when the Minister saith, I baptize thee, and yet doth
not baptize but sprinkle or rantize. And it was truly said by me
that it is a nullity, it being done neither on persons, nor in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Christ appointed to be baptized, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> baptizing the
<hi>Americans</hi> was a meer nullity and mockery. Not do I know
why Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> should say, [<hi>This concludes our selves and all
our Ancestours, even all in the Western Churches for fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years, under damnation</hi>] unless he imagine with the Papists
infant-baptism necessary to salvation.</p>
               <p>That which Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> saith, p. 13. <hi>of the Churches power to
alter any thing from the Form of Christs institution to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by all</hi> Divines, <hi>and that he is none that denies it,</hi> is not true,
except he account none Divines but the Papists. For I know none
but Papists that do acknowledg that the Church hath power to
alter Christs institution. Nor in my practice do I acknowledg
it. I plainly tell Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> I do use to administer the Lords
Supper in the evening, and though. I do not say it was instituted
by Christ to be in the evening, yet because it is called the Lords
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118327:7"/>
Supper, and the Apostle takes notice of the time, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and the administring of it in the morning occasions many to think
they must take it fasting, and not a few that they are first to receive
Christs body in the popish sense, I think it very requisite the Lords
Supper be administred in the evening. The Love-feasts I finde not
appointed by Christ, and therefore might be altered. But in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> advice to me, I advise him to take heed of
that erroneous and dangerous Tenet which avoucheth a power in
the Church to alter Christs institution, which serves to justifie Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
corruptions, and to condemn the practice of all the Reformed
Churches. I fear to embroil the Church of God: they do it who
oppose the truth. I am willing to submit to the judgment of the
Church when they agree with Christ, but to none but Christ, in what
he hath appointed. It is neither true <hi>that the practise of infant-baptism,</hi>
much lese of infant-sprinkling, <hi>hath been fifteen hundred
years:</hi> nor, if it were, is it so strange a thing, that <hi>God suffered
such an error</hi> as that is. I thank Mr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> for his ingenuous
grant, and his modest carriage, and with expressions of my pity of
his being misled by the conceit of the Churches power (by which,
what is meant is hard to say) conceiving I have answered him
sufficiently, I take my leave of him and pass on to Mr. <hi>Cragg.</hi>
Concerning whom the Reader is to be premonished, that by reason
of his fast speaking, and many words, I was often uncertain what
to apply an answer to at the dispute.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cragg's</hi> Dispute is examined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS for his Preface I let it pass. His first <hi>Euthymene; pag.</hi>16:
<hi>Some infants may not be baptized, therefore some infants
may be baptized,</hi> is so frivolous, that I neither did then, nor do
now think it worth any thing but contempt. For if the reasoning
were good, it must be resolved into this Syllogism, All that may not
be baptized may be baptized, Some Infants may not be baptized,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> Some infants may be baptized, there being no other way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Logick Rules to make it good. Any man of common
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118327:7"/>
sense might see the foolery of that Argument. For if it be good he
might in like manner say, Some infants may not have the Lords
Supper, therefore some infants may; some boys are not to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Bishops, therefore some are. I denied the consequence, and
Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> not sensible of his folly prints a Syllogism, which
shews he proved not what was to be proved, which when I would
have rectified by shewing what he should have concluded, he run
on so fast in his vain prattle, that the Reader may easily perceive I
had reason to say, What would the man say?</p>
               <p>The next Argument is concerning the <hi>essence of Baptism,</hi> which
he saith, <hi>belonged to infants; therefore they may be baptized,</hi> and
then insinuates me to have been driven to absurdities in denying
that Baptism is a relation, and <hi>Austins</hi> definition of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, 1. This proposition <hi>the essence of baptism
belongs to infants,</hi> may have two senses, 1. That the Baptism of
infants is true Baptism, that is, is according to transcendental verity
such as hath the nature of Baptism, and in this sense I grant the
Proposition is true, and so it is true that an infants eating bread and
drinking wine is true eating and drinking the Lords Supper, it hath
the essence of it; but this I did not imagine he meant, and therefore
denied his <hi>minor,</hi> till his next Syllogism shewed he meant it, and
then I perceived I should have denied the <hi>major.</hi> But his quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and multiplying words would not permit me to recall my self.
2. The other sense is this, the essence of Baptism, that is, that
which is of the essence to right Administration of Baptism belongs
to infants, in which sense I denied it, nor doth his Argument from
the definition prove it, for it is all one as to argue, infant-baptism
is Baptism, therefore it is right Baptism. As for the absurdities he
imputes to me, I deny them to be absurdities. For I take Baptism
to be either an action or passion, though Christian Baptism have a
relation superadded, and so in the use is a sign, and the <hi>genus</hi> of it,
which is of the essence, I should make an action. As for the other
absurdity, I do confess that the term Sacrament being but a term in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers may be laid aside, nor is there any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nature of Sacraments expressed in Scripture. And I confess I
take <hi>Austins</hi> definition, if it be his, that <hi>a Sacrament is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
sign of invisible grace,</hi> to be but imperfect, sith it may be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118327:8"/>
applied to the descent of the Holy Ghost as a Dove, Christs washing
of his Disciples feet, a persons kneeling and holding up his hands
to pray, the kissing of the Bible, and many other actions which are
not Sacraments, I confess I was weary of these quirks, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
that he used them onely to weary me, and blunt my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to make some oftentation of himself, I replied not to his
vain talk, but called for Scripture-proof.</p>
               <p>As for that which he saith, I denyed <hi>all that were Church-members
were to be baptized, and yet affirmed it in my Sermon:</hi>
in both I said true, the former being understood of invisible, the
latter of visible Church-members.</p>
               <p>In the Argument <hi>pag.</hi> 24. <hi>Those whom God did promise before
the Law, foretell under the Law, actually receive into Covenant</hi>
under the Gospel, those God did appoint Church-members under
the Gospel. But, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo.</hi> Had not Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> quickness hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
me, I had shewed the vanity of the <hi>major,</hi> as well as denied
the <hi>minor.</hi> For if he mean by [<hi>Church-members</hi>] visible Church-members,
and by [<hi>actually receiving into Covenant</hi>] understand
such an actual receiving as is without any act of faith or Profession
of the persons received into Covenant, as I conceive he doth, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the <hi>major.</hi> But I also denied the <hi>minor.</hi> In the next Proof he
changeth the term [<hi>of actually receiving</hi>] into [<hi>being in Covenant</hi>]
Now there is a manifest difference between them, sith a person
may be in Covenant, that is, have a Covenant made to him, who
is not yet born, as <hi>Isaak, Gen.</hi> 17. 21. But he is not actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into Covenant till he be born, and by some acts of his own
engageth himself to be Gods: receiving importing an offering, which
is to be done by Profession. As for his Proof from <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.
I had many Exceptions against it. First, that if it be understood of
the natural seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> the everlastingness of it was but for
a time, and that time afore the Gospel, as in the next Verse, the
possession of <hi>Canaan</hi> is promised to be everlasting, and yet the <hi>Jews</hi>
dispossessed now of it. Which Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> grants, and therefore
must needs grant that the Promise Verse 7. though it be termed
everlasting, yet it is to be understood onely of a limited time, as in
other passages, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. 24 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if meant of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Nor is he resieved by saying, <hi>They shall
have</hi> Canaan <hi>again,</hi> for however the Possession was not everlasting,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118327:8"/>
that is, at all times, particularly not in Gospel-times. As for his
Proof <hi>of the continuance of the Gospel Covenant unto the end of
the world, to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his seed,</hi> the very Text he allegeth,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. doth manifestly express the thing promised to be <hi>justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
and that of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and that <hi>through faith,</hi> that had
not the man a face which could not blush, he would have been
ashamed to have urged it to prove, <hi>that</hi> Abrahams <hi>natural seed
were promised to be in Covenant under the Gospel.</hi> And his next
allegation is as vain, that because <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11. The whole
congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> are said to <hi>stand before the Lord with their
little ones, to enter into Covenant, therefore the Covenant Gen.
17. 7. is to continue to infant natural seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>to the end
of the worlds</hi> whereas the speech is onely of a transient fact, not
of a command, much less of a promise of something perpetually
future, and what is said of <hi>the little ones</hi> is as well said of <hi>wives,
hewers of wood, and drawers of water,</hi> and therefore if thence be
concluded a continuance of covenant to infants, a continuance of
covenant to wives and servants will be concluded.</p>
               <p>His allegation of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. is as vain, For he brings it to
prove, <hi>That if infants were in covenant under the Law, they are
in Covenant under the Gospel,</hi> whereas the meliority of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is not placed in the extent to the sort of persons, for then it
should be extended to more sorts than the Covenant of the Law
was, but <hi>to the meliority</hi> of the promises, which were of better
things, or better terms, then the promises of the Law, but not to
any other than elect and true believers, and so not to infants as
the natural seed of believers.</p>
               <p>And for that which he saith, <hi>This unchurcheth the one half
of Christendome, and leaves them no ordinary means of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
if he mean by Christendome all that are commonly called
Christians, I grant it, if the infants be the one half of them, and
their unchurching be in respect of visible Church-membership,
but count it no absurdity. nor do know what ordinary means of
salvation he conceives they are left without except baptism, which
I take not to be an ordinary means of salvation without faith,
and therefore think it no inconvenience to say that infants are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ordinary means of salvation, which are the preaching the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118327:9"/>
word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet are saved by the election of God, redemption of
Christ, and work of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>What I said, that the Covenant under the Gospel was made
onely with the spiritual seed of Abraham, was right, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
so <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. <hi>John</hi> 8. 39.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor is it true because <hi>the partition wall is broken down,
therefore there is the same Covenant</hi> national to the natural seed
of believers as was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that therefore as the Apostle
speaks <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> (to wit believing Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 16.) <hi>should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his promise in Christ by the Gospel.</hi> Nor is it ture, <hi>That
the Gospel Covenant is made with the whole visible Church,</hi> as
the Gospel Covenant is expressed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And
if I denied the Major <hi>pag.</hi> 29. in the first argument, I confess I
was mistaken through inadvertency, whether by reason of Mr.
<hi>Craggs</hi> fast speaking, or some humane infirmity, or some other
occuirence now not remembred, I cannot tell. But I deny the
Minor understood of the Gospel Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. and the
whole visible Church being taken without any Synecdoche for
every visible Churchmember.</p>
               <p>But I perceive by Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> words page 30. <hi>If the Church in
regard of outward administration of Ordinances (which is the
question) were only the elect, &amp;c.</hi> that the terms Church and
Covenant were so ambiguously used by him, that I knew not
how to conceive of his meaning, and his fast speaking would not
permit me deliberately to consider his words, and therefore no
marvel I desired liberty to explain my self, and to enquire into
Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> meaning, it being impossible for me otherwise to answer
appositely, and to make the disputation profitable for finding out
truth.</p>
               <p>As for that which Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> saith, <hi>That it was the question
whether the Church in regard of outward administration of
Ordinances were onely the elect,</hi> it doth untruly suggest as if I so
conceived, who, though I hold the Church invisible are
the elect onely, and that the Gospel Covenant of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.
10, 11, 12. is made to them only, yet have still granted that the
Church visible consists of others than elect persons, and that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ordinances may lawfully be administred to them upon their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118327:9"/>
profession of faith in Christ. But Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> by confounding
these terms [to be in Covenant, to be subjects of baptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]
misleads unwary hearers and readers.</p>
               <p>The next text Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> brought was <hi>Isaiah</hi> 49. 22. whence
he would prove that <hi>Infants should be Churchmembers under
the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which my answer was at first (though it was otherwise ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
that it is a prophecy that the Gentiles should bring back the
Jewes, not only infants but others, from captivity, which the
words before <hi>verse</hi> 19, 20, 21. and after <hi>verse</hi> 24, 25. do plainly
evince; and this is given as the meaning by the New Annotations
made by Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> who doth on verse 23. say, <hi>it was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in those</hi> Persian <hi>Potentates, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Darius,
Ahasuerus.</hi> Nor is there in the Contents of the Chapter (which
Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> without ground makes the judgement of the Church
of <hi>England</hi>) any thing to the contrary, but the words, which are
[18. <hi>The ample restauration of the Church, 24. The powerfull
deliverance out of the Captivity</hi>] do rather confirm this. If any
people laughed at this, they shewed their ignorance, and Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi>
shewed his heedlessness when he said, <hi>That it was an addition to
the text that the Gentiles should bring the lewes,</hi> when the very
distinction of [<hi>thy children</hi>] from [<hi>the Gentiles</hi>] shews it meant of
the Jewes, otherwise it should have been [their children] in the
third person, not [thine] in the second; nor can it be meant of
Gods children as his, for then it should be [mine] in the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for God speaks those words. Though I deny not but the
words may be accommodated to the times of the Gospel, but not
to Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> purpose of bringing infants to baptism, which
hath no colour from the text. Which appears by considering Mr.
<hi>Craggs</hi> answer to my questions put forth needfully to cleer the
text.</p>
               <p n="1">For 1. if by [<hi>standard</hi>] be meant [<hi>baptism</hi>] which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
never calls Gods standard, and the bringing should be to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
then the sense should be that Supreme Magistrates as Kings &amp;
and Queens should bringinfants in their arms, and carrythem on
shoulders to baptism, which no story ever mentions to have been
done, and is too srivolous to be made the matter of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:118327:10"/>2. The terms [<hi>nursing Fathers, and nursing Mothers</hi>] shew
it to be a <hi>Metaphor, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
                  </hi> Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> granting, though it follow not,
that <hi>nothing could be gathered from it,</hi> yet it follows, that Mr.
<hi>Craggs</hi> application, which is according to the proper sense of the
words, is not right. What I said, that it was fulfilled in <hi>Hesters</hi> time,
I said rightly, and Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> before me in those Annotations
of his which are taken for the most incomparably learned, and
<hi>Hester</hi> as a Queen among the Gentiles, might well be stiled a
nursing mother to the Jewes. I will not trouble my self to examine
Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> dictates, but refer the Reader to the notes of Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for what I said, that though it should be understood of the
times of the Gospel, yet it might be meant of grown men perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the preaching of the Gospel, as <hi>Junius</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> was
true. Nor doth the bringing in the bosome being a <hi>Metaphor</hi>
prove they were infants. And if so, the Church is spoken to, and
the children were both the Gentiles children, and yet [<hi>thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>]
that is the Churches. And so theres no interfering in my
words.</p>
               <p>The next text was <hi>Isaiah</hi> 65. 20. in reading which Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi>
left out those words, <hi>nor an old man that hath not filled his daies,</hi>
nor would read them, nor the words following, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. I
perceived he meant nothing but fallacy, and yet he added impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to it in accusing me as urging it to deceive the people, when
his own course, in concealing what would have cleered the text,
had a manifest shew of deceit, and mine of plain dealing.</p>
               <p>As for his interpretation, <hi>There shall be no more an infant of
daies, that is, infants shall not be uncapable of the seal,</hi> it hath
no proof but his dictate, and it is without all shew of probability,
there being not a word of any such thing as ou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ward ordinances,
but of peace, increase, possession, and long life, as the verses
before and after shew.</p>
               <p>The like is to be said of his interpretation of the other part of
the verse, <hi>The child shall dy an hundred years old, that is, as an
hundred years old, or as well a Churchmember as if he
were a hundred years old,</hi> when the term [as] is added to the
text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:118327:10"/>To which he replyed that I do put in [as] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. and
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 19. But this latter is false. I grant I do so interpret
[baptized 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2] because otherwise the proposition were
not true, and the sense is plain according to this sense, were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
that is, their passage through the Sea and under the cloud
was to them as if they had been baptized, and so did <hi>Grotius</hi>
expound it, which is the same with that which others mean
when they say, they were Analogically baptized. But in <hi>Isaiah</hi>
65. 20. there is no need of such an interpretation, and that I may
use the words of Mr. <hi>Gataker Annot. on Isaiah</hi> 65. 20. <hi>The
Syntax is familiar, and as cleer as the day-light or Sunshine:
the child or youth (that now is) shall dy the son of an hundred
years; that is, shall be an hundred years old when he dyeth.</hi>
Nor is this contrary to the Contents, which though they be intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet there is no Canon or Act of
any Synod which did ever make them so, and who ever framed
them, yet I think it no disparagement to say that Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi>
understood the text as well or better than he: and this text was
rightly made by me answerable to <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 4. nor is there either
absurdity or <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntruth, or blasphomy in my interpretation: which
might be shewed by transcribing Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> forementioned
notes on <hi>Isaiah</hi> 65. 17, 19, 25. were it not I am forced to be
brief. What I said about Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> his use was true, that he
would require the respondent afore he answered to read the text,
and consider it, which is necessary in Divinity disputes, however
Respondents be restrained in other disputes.</p>
               <p>And for my <hi>Explosion</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi> it is a meer figment, and that
neither Dr. <hi>Savage,</hi> nor the Doctor of the Chair, did avoid my
argument by their answer is manifest enough from Dr. <hi>Savage</hi>
his own recital of his answer in his printed book, and this had
been shewed in print ere this but that the Printer failed to print
my answer in the fit time. The frivolous conceit of my fear of Mr.
<hi>Craggs</hi> gunshot is foolish; I do not count Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> arguments
to be of so much force as a Squib.</p>
               <p>As for his argument from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. I answered, that all
nations or whole nations did not include every part, all nations
being taken synecdochically for the disciples of all nations.</p>
               <p>As for his division I gave the genuine reason why infants are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118327:11"/>
excepted from the precept of baptizing, because they are no
disciples. Nor was there any defect in Logick when I did
not reduce it to one of his members. For [capable of baptism]
and [disciples] are not terms subordinate, but distinct, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
opposition. And though to be disciples made them capable,
yet there is a difference between the terms. I presume Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi>
thinks baptized persons already disciples, yet not capable of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p>What he saith of me, <hi>That I found fault with him at</hi> Rosse
<hi>for translating <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> make disciples of all nations,</hi> I am as
sure is his fiction, as that I spake any thing there to him. Nor will,
I think, any man believe I should do so, except he found me now
crazed in my brain, that hath either read my <hi>Examen par.</hi> 3. s. 12.
or 13. or shall read that part of my Review now in Press, in
which I often assert that translation, and largely answer objections
to the contrary in the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, &amp;c. of
that book. In which book I shall at large answer all that Mr.
<hi>Baxter</hi> hath said to prove infants disciples from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10.
As for what Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> saith here, it is frivolous. For though <hi>v.</hi>
1. 5. there is mention of circumcision, yet not of circumcision as
acted on infants, but as taught brethren, and when the Apostles v.
6. did consider of the matter, they did not consider of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as acted but as taught, and not only of circumcision, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of imposing the whole Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as necessary, which
was the putting the yoke v. 10. and it is ridiculous to conceive
that those teachers mentioned <hi>verse</hi> 1. did attempt to do any thing
to infants, and therefore it is a meer wrangling to contend that
the disciples on whom they would have put the yoke, <hi>verse</hi> 10. were
infants, contrary to the constant use of the term throughout all
the New Te<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ament some hundreds of time.</p>
               <p>As so: Mr. <hi>Craggs Arguments</hi> from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39. it is false
that the Apostles inference is as Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> insinuated, unless his
argument have four terms, that they may be baptized to whom is
the promise. For the Apostle expresseth a duty in the imperative
mood, not a <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight in the indicative or potential, it is [<hi>be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>]
not [<hi>may be baptized</hi>] as in Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> Conclusion.</p>
               <p>I excepted that those parents were not then believers, which Mr.
<hi>Cragg</hi> co<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>ied in saying, <hi>They were believers</hi> in fieri, <hi>though
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118327:11"/>
not perhaps</hi> in facto, which is all one as to say they were not yet
believers, but in the way to it. As for his saying, <hi>They were
believers by outward assent and disposition, though perhaps not by
inward assent and habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I reply 1. if they were by disposition, how were they not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
assent?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How doth he know they were believers by outward assent
and not by inward? Doth he know they were hypocrites?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What act did they shew which expressed outward assent to
the acknowledgement of Christ as their Lord? what Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi>
saith he knows of me, and tells of a ministers rule, is a fault he
chargeth me with as not pertaining to the dispute.</p>
               <p>What he saith, that <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Repentance is not made a
condition of being baptized,</hi> is in my apprehension manifestly
false. For the requiring Repentance as first to be done, and then
Baptism to be annexed doth make it a condition of baptism, as
when it is said, <hi>Believe and thou shalt be saved,</hi> belief is made
a condition of salvation. His talk <hi>about incompleat repentance,
because they were pricked in their hearts, as a sufficient qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
for baptism,</hi> doth make the Apostles speech as idle, which
requires that <hi>which they had already,</hi> if Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> say true; But
who will believe Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> that the Apostle required no more to
baptism but an incompleat repentance or pricking the heart, <hi>v.</hi>
38. Which it is said they had before? or that he took that as a
sufficient qualification for baptism, and yet required more as previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to it? Or who will believe him that the 3000. Jewes were
baptized upon an incompleat repentance, when the text expressely
saith, <hi>Then they that gladly received the word were baptized?</hi>
or that there was <hi>no new</hi> act of <hi>Peter,</hi> but a <hi>recapitulation
of the heads of his Sermon that he preached to them before
they were pricked in conscience, or were exhorted to be baptized,</hi>
when the text saith, <hi>with many other words he testified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted</hi>?
Or that there was any, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, putting that as

note the order of time, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which our Translatours
render [<hi>then</hi>] and if it be rendred [<hi>therefore</hi>] it proves that which

               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118327:12"/>To the Argument, <hi>To whom the promise of grace belonged, to
them baptism belongs also: But the promise of grace belongs to
believers and their children. Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answered out of the text, <hi>when they are called,</hi> or are
believers, not before, it neither belongs to fathers nor children
without calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Mr.</hi> Cragg <hi>replyed,</hi> 1. <hi>That</hi> the verb is in the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative
present tense,<hi>which implies,</hi> it is to them for the present,
as well to your children as to you. 2. The opposition is between
them and their children as near, to distinguish them as to whom
the promise was at present from them to whom it was afar of, that
is in the future,</p>
               <p n="1">But all this is frivolous. For 1. the verb is in the Indicative
Mood when it is said, <hi>The promise is to those that are afar off,</hi>
as well as when it is said, <hi>The promise is to you and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their being afar off</hi> is not in respect of time, but of place
or dwelling, and the meaning is, they that are in the dispersion as
it is called <hi>James</hi> 1. 1. or if it were meant in the sense that it is
used <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 15. (not <hi>Romans</hi> 2. 15. as Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> miscites) yet
they are said to be afar off in respect of Gods favour, or their
affection to him, not in respect of time.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is frequent, even in speeches like this, to put the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
mood present tense, by an enallage of tense, for the future, as
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10; 12.</p>
               <p>I added, that by [children] is no necessity to understand infants,
yet Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> contrary to the common use, as <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 20.
would have [<hi>children</hi>] restrained to infants.</p>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>signifies properly a young child</hi>? or that <hi>child is</hi> ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logum
<hi>to old and young</hi>? I had hitherto thought child and parent
had been Relatives, and that child signifies as well an elder as
a younger. To that of the verb of the present tense answer is

               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:118327:12"/>How doth Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> prove that <hi>their children they had were
young children</hi>? It is vainly supposed that <hi>the Promise is to them
&amp; their children, as the</hi> Jews <hi>children were in covenant with their
Parents.</hi> The Text makes it to belong neither to parents nor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but those that God cals? Does Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> think that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing
<hi>Jews</hi> had the promise? And yet they were in covenant
in his sense before, even the whole Nation? Or doth he think that
Christs bloud was not avenged on them? If it were, How was the
Remedy as large as the Disease?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next Mr.</hi> Cragg <hi>argues thus,</hi> They that are holy with a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-holiness
are capable of the outward visible part of blessing:
But infants of believers are holy with a covenant-holiness; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are capable of the outward and visible part.</p>
               <p>Of which Syllogism I might have denied the <hi>major,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Covenant-holiness according to election, which doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
instate the person in that which he calls the outward visible
part of the blessing, by which he means title to Baptism. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the <hi>minor,</hi> understanding it of the outward Covenant-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as
they call it, which I truly said, is gibberish, and however
<hi>Vossius, Bullinger</hi> (for <hi>Grotius</hi> I think means otherwise) conceive
of it, or the Assembly, yet it is a meer mistake, and that holiness of
children which is mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. is truly said by me to
be onely matrimonial holiness, or legitimation. And his argument
out of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> I justly retorted, that in six hundred times in
which Holy is used in Scripture, in none of them it is found for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Covenant-holiness intituling to Baptism: which is a right
way of answering, though it be called indirect by the Logicians.
And as for that he replies that <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. I confessed at <hi>Ross</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-holiness
is meant, I grant it, but not outward Covenant-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
intituling to Baptism, but that real saving holiness which is
according to the election of grace, according to which <hi>Iews</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
shall hereafter be graffed in again.</p>
               <p>I said, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Holy seed</hi> is all one with a legitimate seed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Against this it is objected, <hi>that then
the meaning should be, The holy seed, that is the lawfully begotten
Iews, have mingled themselves with the seed of these Lands,
that is the bastards of those Lands</hi> But I deny this consequence.
The sense is this, <hi>the holy seed,</hi> that is, those who were descended
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118327:13"/>
by lawfull generation of allowed women, these have taken to
themselves of the daughters of the nations whom God forbad them
to marry, which is plain out of the <hi>vers</hi> 1, 2. so that the people of
the Land with whom they mingled themselves, are not considered
as illegitimate in there birth, but as not allowed to the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
and yet the holy seed is that seed which by a right generation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Moses</hi> law was legitimate. As for what he saith, that
<hi>Iepthe was a Saint and yet a bastard,</hi> it is true, he was holy in one
respect as borne from above, yet unholy by naturall birth. And
whereas he saith, <hi>Moses had childeren by an</hi> Ethiopian <hi>woman,
and yet not unholy,</hi> I grant it: for the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> woman was not
forbidden: nor were <hi>Rahab</hi> though a <hi>Canaanitess,</hi> nor <hi>Ruth</hi> a
<hi>Moabitess</hi> when they joyned themselves to the God of <hi>Israel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,
or there children illegitimate: yet this is not the same
with Covenant-holiness, intituling to Church-ordinances, but legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
intituling to be reckoned in the genealogy and inheritance
of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The last argument Mr</hi> Cragg <hi>used was this,</hi> They that Christ took
up in his arms, blessed, said, the Kingdom of God belonged unto
them, pronounced a curse upon those that despised, and would not
receive them, are holy with a covenant-holiness; But Christ lock
up little children into his arms, blessed them, said, the Kingdom of
God belonged unto them, pronounced a curse upon those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
and would not receive them: therefore little children are
holy with a covenant-holiness.</p>
               <p>In this Argument I denied the <hi>minor,</hi> after some debate about the
way of forming of it, in which I imagined that fallacy <hi>I</hi> do not now
upon fight deprehend, &amp; particularly I denied, <hi>that Christ pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a
curse upon those that despised and would not receive them.</hi>
Then he alleged <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 2. whence he argued, <hi>They to whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Kingdom of Heaven are holy &amp; in covenant: But to little
children belongs the Kingdom of Heaven; therefore little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are holy and in covenant.</hi> In which Argument any Reader
may perceive he proved not what I denied, <hi>that Christ pronounced
a curse upon those that despised, and would not receive little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or infants,</hi> and yet that Text he alleged did not say of little
children, <hi>that to them belongs the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but
those that <hi>were not to be offended, v.</hi> 6. <hi>despised, v.</hi> 10. were to be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118327:13"/>
                  <hi>received in Christs name,</hi> v. 5. were not little children in age,
but little ones in spirit, which appeared in that they are said <hi>to be
believers,</hi> v. 6. and <hi>to be converted,</hi> and <hi>become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
To which, as the Relator himself sets it down, Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi>
said, <hi>The meaning is not, that the little children are converted,</hi>
which is a grant of what I alleged, that the little ones not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
despised, but received, were not little children in age, but
affection of humility. Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> added, <hi>But it hath relation to
the Desciples in the first Verse, who must be converted from their
actual sins, and become as little children which have no actual
sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which words it is true, <hi>I</hi> said, and that justly, O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
are the People that are seduced with these Toys, Are you
not ashamed? To which he replied, and it seems is not ashamed
that it is printed, <hi>I see nothing worthy of shame:</hi> whereas if this
speech of his were true, then this is a truth, <hi>Except men be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from their actual sins, and become as little children, which
have no actual sin, they shall not enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
for this is the meaning of Christs words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> interpretation, which whosoever believes
must of necessity despair of Heaven, sith as <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Chap. 3. 2.
In many things we offend all:</hi> and <hi>John 1. Epist. chap. 1. ver. 8.
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth
is not in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> added, <hi>that the Disciples were belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
which are meant Matth. 18. 6. and not the children,</hi> and
yet saith, <hi>his argument remains unanswered,</hi> hath more of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
in it. For his argument being that <hi>Christ pronounced
a curse on them that despised and received not little ones in age,</hi>
and yet confessing that this was meant not of little ones in age, but
Disciples, believers in him, it is the heighth of impudency to say
his argument is unanswered, when his own confession answerd it.
Justly here, after five hours time, having promised but one, did I
breakoff, and having had experience of Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> meet cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
at <hi>Rosse</hi> and <hi>Abergaveny,</hi> dwelling many miles from that
Town, and finding nothing in him, and those other Paedobaptists <hi>I</hi>
have answered, but a spirit of wrangling, <hi>I</hi> yielded not to any other
Dispute, nor shall for time to come, being now sufficiently taught
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118327:14"/>
by experience what dealing I am like to have, yield to such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes.</p>
               <p>As for that which Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> saith, <hi>He was hurried to that
extemporal discourse through importunity,</hi> I do not believe it,
being advertised before, that if I came to <hi>Abergaveny</hi> he would
oppose me. That the speech of him that said I answered nothing,
was the speech of an impudent, brazen-faced fellow, I think any
will judge who reads this my writing.</p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whatever his worth be, yet how justly I might
say (though the words set down were not used as the Relator ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
them) that I have answered all he saith against me, will
appear in the Review of the Dispute between him and me, and
others, of which part of it is printed, part in the Press, and the
rest (if the Lord permit) shall not be slackned.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> arguments from <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Romans</hi> 11. and other
places, if they be not in his Sermon (to the examining of which I
now hasten) yet are they in other books answered by me: I shall
take some view of his Sermon on which I had made some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions
before, according to the imperfect Copy I had then,
and sent them to <hi>A ergaveny,</hi> but have them not now by me in
<hi>London,</hi> yet however in this straight of time I think it necessary
to write thus much.</p>

Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> hath a special tooth at Itinerants, though his Relator
claw Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> and Mr.<hi>W.</hi> But what he saith, that <hi>it is too strict</hi> an
interpretation to expound <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. of men of age and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118327:14"/>
excluding children, shews he little considers what he
saith. For if it be so, then Christ, commandeth the Apostles to
preach the Gospel to infants, and sith Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> is bound to do
so, he sheweth that he sins against his own light, if he do not so.
But how foolish it would be for him to attempt it, his own words
shew, when he saith, <hi>Infants are not capable to be taught</hi> of
men. And when he saith, <hi>That infants only</hi> in actu primo <hi>are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the first seeds of understanding, of profession of faith,</hi>
I would know, in what <hi>sense they are sensible of the benefit they
have by Christ.</hi> And whereas he grants, That <hi>baptism is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by

                     </gap>y of precept if conveniently it may be had,</hi> it is all I
assested in my Sermen, when I said all that would be saved must
be baptized after profession. If <hi>Austin</hi> were a hard Father to
infants for holding they must be baptized or not see the Kingdom
of God, then Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> cannot gather from <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. infants
baptism. From <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. is rightly gathered that believing
is to be before baptism, and yet from <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4. it is not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gathered that we must be baptized, before we can hear the
word preached or repent; For the text doth not express that <hi>John</hi>
baptized afore he preached, but recites these two as connexed,
yet the latter is put first, not because first done, but because he was
to set down more amply what he preached.</p>
               <p>Though we cannot know that the person to be baptized hath a
saving faith, yet a saving faith is the rule of baptism to the person
baptized, he should not undertake that ordinance without a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
faith; and in respect of the baptizer, so far as he can discern, he
should require a saving faith of those he baptizeth.</p>
               <p>Dipping over head, or baptizing over head, after profession of
faith, is no invention of man, but the Command of Christ, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Apostles, and their Successors for many ages, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism
was opposed many ages afore <hi>John of Leyden,</hi> who
though he were otherwise not to be justified, yet I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that any hath written he ever confessed that he had that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from Satan.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> saith, <hi>Baptizing is in Greek any washing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by dipping or sprinkling.</hi> And he cites <hi>Ravanel</hi> who hath
made a Dictionary according to the present use of terms. But he
shews not out of any of the Pillars, as he calls them, of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118327:15"/>
                  <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, that baptizing in <hi>Greek</hi> ever signifies to sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He confesses that</hi> Casaubon <hi>in his notes on</hi> Matth. 3. 6. <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
between baptizing and rantizing or sprinkling, But saith,</hi>
The whole state of the question is determined against me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he addes, that their judgement is deservedly long since
exploded, and trampled down, that would have baptizing to
be by dipping, seeing the force and efficacy of this mystery consists
not in that.</p>
               <p n="1">But 1. by Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> leave the question is plainly determined
for me by <hi>Casaubon,</hi> when he distinguisheth between baptizing
and sprinkling, for that is the question, not wherein the efficacy
and force of the mystery consists.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though <hi>Casaubon</hi> were a very learned man, yet this speech
of his is not right. For we are to observe what Christ appoints,
though the efficacy and force of the mystery of Sacrament consist
not in it, as we are to break bread, not take a wafer-cake down
whole, drink wine in the Lords Supper, because of the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though the force and efficacy of the mystery consist not in it.
Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> speeches out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Dominicus à Sato,</hi> are
of no weight with them who know who those Doctors were, to
wit, Papists, and very unskilful in the <hi>Greek</hi> language.</p>
               <p>It is as vain which Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> saith the <hi>Israelites were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
when their feet did but touch the water,</hi> for the text saith <hi>Exo.
14. 29. they walked upon dry land in the middest of the Sea, and
the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their
left,</hi> and therefore their feet did not so much as touch the water,
much less were they sprinkled with it. And if the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
baptized in the cloud, and yet no water upon them, then the text
1<hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. doth not prove baptizing to be by sprinkling, but
proves plainly that as <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> said they were baptized, that
is, <hi>they were as if they had been baptized,</hi> or as other, <hi>they were analogically baptized,</hi> that is in proportion, or likeness, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,
that is according to what is meant by that term.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is without proof, yea false which Mr.</hi> Cragg <hi>saith,</hi> Where
is mention<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="6 letters">
                     <desc>••••••</desc>
                  </gap> in the Gospel of washing themselves, of Cups,
of Vessels, of Tables, this cannot be meant of plunging in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
so often, but rinsing. <hi>For water was not so scarce but that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118327:15"/>
they might do it by dipping as well as sprinkling. He might have
seen</hi> Ainsworth <hi>on</hi> Levit. 11. 32. <hi>who out of the Hebrew Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
tells us,</hi> All that are unclean, whether Men or Vessels,
are not cleansed, but by dipping (or baptizing) in water: And
wheresoever the Law speaketh of washing a mans flesh, or wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of clothes for uncleanness, it is not but by dipping the whole
body therein.</p>
               <p>Me thinks Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> should allow Anabaptists to make conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
though they allow not his. And that <hi>John Baptists</hi>
and <hi>Philips</hi> going down into the water, proves something me thinks
Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> should not deny, sith it cannot reasonably be imagined
they should go down, not to the water, as Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> would have
it, but into the water, whereas for baptizing a person a man might
easily have fetched or taken water out of any spring to baptize with,
if it had been so to be done by sprinkling, and not by dipping.
But if he please to see a book intituled <hi>Of Baptism,</hi> written by an
eminent man in the State, he might see many of the prime writers,
even leading Protestants, gathering dipping thence, as used then in
baptizing.</p>
               <p>The like they do from <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. Of which whatever <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher</hi>
or Traveller saith, <hi>Enon</hi> (where <hi>John</hi> baptized) <hi>was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
brook that one may stride over scarce knee deep, and therefore
not capable of dipping</hi> (which doth not follow) <hi>deserves not to be
believed in this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 64, we do not press a necessity of dipping, because
of the resemblance, but from the resemblance alluded to shew the
use then, ingenuously confessed by Mr. <hi>Vaugban,</hi> and therefore
should be the use still. Nor doth it follow, we must ly<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> three daies
and nights in water, the resemblance of Christs burial is to be
continued though not the duration.</p>
               <p>Whatever other resemblance there may be of our burial with
Christ, yet we are to follow the institution and practice set down
in Scripture, from which he that swerves (as Sprinkless do) do sin
against Christs command, whatever any Divines or Assemblies of
men say to the contrary.</p>
               <p>It is well Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> confesseth, <hi>That if he were to baptize
converted</hi> Turks <hi>or</hi> Pagans <hi>of ripe age he might baptize them by
dipping:</hi> it shews that it is only for infants sake that the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118327:16"/>
of Christ is altered, and so one corruption hath brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>What he addes, <hi>Provided their garments were not first bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
or washed,</hi> intimates he would have them naked, which
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would conclude to be against the sixth and seventh
Command, and he may do well to school Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> for it. His
reason is as foolish, though the Garments be baptized in water,
yet are not baptized with that use that the person is, but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
nor baptized as Bells to drive away Devils, Nor is by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
the garment any worship done to it, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
doth to the image: For then the baptizing the body should be
worshipping it, the Garments and body are not worshipped at
all by baptizing, and therefore foolishly is it compared to <hi>Romish</hi>
Superstition and Idolatry. He that affirms that baptizing without
dipping is not lawful, that it is will-worship, that the sprinkling
used is a nullity, that notwithstanding such pretended baptism,
yet baptism remains a duty, speaks but truth. The decree of
the Senate of <hi>Zurick</hi> was an unrighteous decree, which, whatever
state follows, it will draw the guilt of murdering innocent persons
on it, and Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> by reciting it with seeming approbation,
doth make it probable that he is a bloody-minded man, who
would rejoice to see innocent men, who out of tenderresse of
conscience follow the plain rule of Christ, so put to death: which
its not unlikely to be the aim of his, or his Complices printing
this book against those he calls Anabaptists, that he might stir
up either Magistrates or furious common people against them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> saith, <hi>He hath resolved the former doubt, that
baptizing is not dipping,</hi> and yet page 81. the Authors he cites,
and by citing approves, do all make dipping or dying one of the
first of its significations. Now he undertakes to prove <hi>that infants
may, nay ought to be baptized.</hi> And he begins as an Advocate
for infants with this childish preface, that <hi>those poor souls cannot
speak for themselves,</hi> as if in speaking for their baptism he spake
for them, when he doth thereby rather speak for that which is
to their hurt, and calls them poor souls, whom before he called
Saints.</p>
               <p>There is more in his pittyfull preface, He <hi>supposeth, if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
had been asked, why they did not put down Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118327:16"/>
in plainer terms, they would have answered, that they
thought none would have denyed it.</hi> And I suppose they would
have answered, that they thought none would have affirmed it,
being quite against Christs appointment, and their practice, who
had then no such custome, nor the Churches of God.</p>
               <p>The rest, as it is taken from Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> so it is answered in
the answer to him now in the Press <hi>sect.</hi> 3. Lets view Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi>
Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His first is,</hi> Those that are in Covenant with God ought to
have the seal of the Covenant which is baptism; But infants of
believing parents are in Covenant with God; Ergo.</p>
               <p>He saith, <hi>The former Proposition is firm by the confession of
all Diviues, even our adversaries,</hi> and cites five, but not
where they say it, nor is any one his Adversary in this point. It is
true <hi>Ferus</hi> was a Popish Frier, though more ingenuous than most
of them. But doth Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> think we must take that for true,
which Protestants and Papists do avow without any proof from
Scripture? If so, then let us lay aside the Scripture, and read their
books. But he might know, and tis likely did know, that I
(though I will not take on me the name of a Divine) yet have
denyed, yea and proved his former proposition to be false <hi>Exam.

Review first part sect.</hi> 5. which shall be fully vindicated (God
assisting) in the <hi>third part.</hi> Yea were his arguing good, it would
prove infants were wronged because they had not the communion.
For I can as well from his own <hi>medium</hi> prove that they are to
have it, as he Baptism.</p>
               <p>The Minor he takes on him to prove from <hi>Genesis</hi> 17. 7. But
there is not a word of infants of believing parents. But to prove
it he ci es <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> a Jesuit, for him, and yet had he
not falsly translated his words, the words would have appeared
to be against him. For whereas he renders them in, <hi>The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
seed to the faithful</hi> (which mars his sense) it is, <hi>In the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual seed the faithful.</hi> So likewise <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. though there be not
the term <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, yet it is directly against him, for it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
justification to the believing Gentiles onely from <hi>Abrahams</hi>
promise, not a promise to them and their seed. I deny not but that
<hi>Isaac was in Covenant with God,</hi> that is, a child of the promise,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118327:17"/>
not onely <hi>when he was but eight days old,</hi> but also afore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
yea afore he was born; but when he saith, <hi>he had the seal</hi>
(meaning Circumcision) <hi>by virtue of the Lamb to be slain,</hi> it is
strange Divinity to me, who never heard or read that any person
was circumcised by virtue of Christs death, but by reason of Gods
command. And that which he saith, <hi>Much more the Children of
believing Parents by virtue of the Lamb that is already slain,</hi>
which seems to intimate, that Circumcision is due to them much
more, and that by virtue of Christs death, is a foppery like to the
Authors ingeny. He saith, <hi>Deut. 29. 11. When all the People
stood in covenant before the Lord, their little ones are mentioned
amongst the rest.</hi> And are not their wives, and servants, hewers of
wood, and drawers of water? Are all these in covenant with
God? How doth he prove they were believers infants? The words
<hi>v.</hi> 4. seem to make to the contrary. It is no shift but a manifest
truth, that those, <hi>Acts 2. 38, 39.</hi> to whom <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is to you and your childdren,</hi> were not then believers in
Christ, when the words were spoken to them. For, 1. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
exhorts to repentance, therefore they had not yet repented, and
so were not believers. Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> himself, <hi>pag.</hi> 78. in this <hi>Sermon</hi>
saith, <hi>Repentance is a fruit and effect of faith,</hi> therefore according
to him, not before it. And in the Dispute, <hi>pag.</hi> 52. he made them
<hi>believers</hi> in fieri, with an incompleat repentance, <hi>though perhaps
not believers</hi> in facto, 2.<hi>v.</hi> 40. he exhorted them with more
words, and then <hi>v.</hi> 41. some of them <hi>gladly received the Word,</hi>
and were believers. Yet <hi>Peter</hi> said to them before they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<hi>The Promise is to you and your children,</hi> nor is there a
word in the Text that makes it clear, that <hi>as soon as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
their children were in covenant with them, and to be
baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His second argument is,</hi> Such as were circumcised under the
Law may be baptized under the Gospels: But infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were circumcised under the Law; Therefore they may be
baptized under the Gospel. He cites <hi>Whitaker saying,</hi> all the
Anabaptists shall not be able to resist this argument.</p>
               <p>I answer, notwithstanding so learned a mans conceit, it hath
not the force of a feather so as to need resistance. To it I answer,
1. Indirectly by retortion. Such as were circumcised under the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118327:17"/>
Law may be baptized under the Gospel: But infants of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
as the males bought with <hi>Abrahams</hi> money of the stranger,
not of his seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 12, 13, 23, 27. persons out of Covenant as
<hi>Ishmael, Gen.</hi> 17, 19, 21, 25. were circumcised under the Law:
<hi>Ergo.</hi> If the one be irresistible so is other. 2. Directly, by denying
the <hi>Major</hi> if it be universal; if not, the syllogism is naught, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
from particulars. His proofs are vain. That from <hi>Austin</hi>
is of no force, unless it be supposed, 1. That by circumcising under
the Law, and baptizing under the Gospel, the grace of God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
which is a popish conccit. Circumcision did binde to the
keeping of the Law, but never that I finde is the grace of God said
to be either physically or morally conferred by the Circumcision of
each person rightly circumcised. 2. It supposeth, if infants be not
baptized, the grace of God is straiter in the New Testament than
in the old. But that is false. For the grace of God is as much
without Sacraments as with it. Above two thousand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Abrham</hi> was circumcised there was neither Circnmcision
nor Baptism of infants, nor any other Sacrament instead thereof;
Shall we say that Gods grace was straiter before <hi>Abrahams</hi> time
than since? As bad as the Schoolmen were, who gave too much to
Sacraments, yet they held, <hi>that the grace of God is not tied to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That question from <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>How were it a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
if all poor infants that were in Covenant under the Law
were out of Covenant under the Gospel,</hi> runs upon these common
mistakes, that to be circumcised or baptized is all one as to be in
covenant; all that were in covenant were to be circnmcised or
baptized; all that were not, were out of covenant; that the reason of
the circumcising or baptizing a person is his being in covenant,
which are all false, as I have proved <hi>Exam. Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Baily, Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Antipaed. Part.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. and shall
<hi>Part.</hi> 3. in many Sections, if God permit. And to the question I
answer from the next words, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. the new Covenant <hi>is a
better Covenant because it is established on better promises,</hi>
though it were imagined never a poor infant (as he childishly
speaks) which yet I do dot conceive, were in Covenant.</p>
               <p>The next from <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. supposeth, <hi>If infants be not to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
the grace of God appears not to them,</hi> which is of no force,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118327:18"/>
unless that popish conceit obtain, that by it, and not without it,
Gods grace appears to all. But this is false, and not in the Text.
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> words are not that <hi>Christ was a little one,</hi> that little ones
might be baptized from his example, for then he would have been
baptized in infancy, whereas he was not baptized till about thirty
years of age. We need not deny Christs Redemption of infants,
because we deny their Baptism, there's no such connexion between
them. His saying <hi>of little ones that they were the first Martyrs
that suffered for Christ,</hi> is false. For how were they Martyrs who
testified nothing concerning Christ? That of the Collect in the
Common Prayer book on <hi>Innocents</hi> day, that <hi>they witnessed onely
by dying</hi> is vain; For dying without some other expression doth not
witness: nor did they suffer for Christ whom they knew not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of <hi>Herods</hi> beastly rage. This speech of Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> smels
rank of the Common Prayer Book superstition in keeping <hi>Innocents</hi>
day, which it seems Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> yet retains; But is nothing to the
proof of his <hi>major,</hi> nor any thing hitherto alleged. That which he
saith last, hath most shew of proof, <hi>that Baptism came in place of
Circumcision, the Apostle clears it, Col. 2. 11, 12. Ye are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
with Circumcision made without hands, How is that?
buried with him in Baptism:</hi> but it is not true that he saith, ye
are circumcised with Circumcision made without hands, in that
ye are buried with him in Baptism: these are predicated of the
same persons, and so were conjoyned, but yet not so as to express
how that the former was done by the latter, no more than by that
which follows, that <hi>therein they were raised by the faith of the
operation of God who raised Christ from the dead:</hi> yea it had
been false, so expounded: for how could it be true that they were
circumcised without hands, in that they were buried in Baptism
with hands? Nor if this were granted, were it true, <hi>that it is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Apostle that Baptism comes in the room of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:</hi>
For there is not a word to that end, yea the scope is to prove
that we have all in Christ without Circumcision, as <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
shew, and that Christ came in the place of Circumcision, and the
rest of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ceremonies, as <hi>v.</hi> 17. is expressed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle asserts the contrary, that no Rite but Christ came in
the room of Circumcision. If any ask why is <hi>v.</hi> 12. added, I
have answered formerly, and the answer is not gainsaid by M. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:118327:18"/>
that it is to shew how persons come to be in Christ, and so to
be compleat in him, which he usually ascribeth to Faith and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5. and they are put together, <hi>Col.</hi>
2. 12. so that if Baptism be conceived thence to succeed Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
Faith also is said to succeed it: which is more agreeable to
the expressions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23, 25. I add the Circumcision mentioned
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. is either Circumcision made without hands, or Christs
personal Circumcision, therefore if the placing of Baptism after
<hi>v.</hi> 12. prove its succession to Circumcision, it proves onely its suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to that made without hands, which was not the Ceremony
commanded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. or to Christs Circumcision, not to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Circumcision of others. Yet were a succession granted, this
proves not, it must be in Baptism as in Circumcision, without a like
command, as I prove <hi>Antipaed: Part. 2. Sect.</hi> 2, 3. No more than
because the Ministers of the Gospel succeed the Priests of the Law,
doth it follow, the Ministers children must be Ministers, anointed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it was in the Law. So that Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> irresistible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is as easily blown away as a feather. And I hardly imagine
any Anabaptist so called to be so weak but that he is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it, by telling Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> that his first Proposition is false, unless
there were the like command to baptize infants as there was to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise
them.</p>
               <p>If the third argument arise thence, it hath its answer thence,
that it is frivolous talk in Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> to speak as if denying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
Baptism were <hi>putting out of the Covenant, disfranchizing,</hi>
and circumcising, supposed being in Covenant, was a seal of the
covenant of grace. His proof <hi>that the Gospel puts not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
out of the Covenant</hi> is true of the elect infants, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of grace expressed in the Gospel. And yet his proofs are
silly. <hi>New born babes desire milk, little childeren are humble,
and are proposed herein as paterns to us, therefore they are in
Covenant;</hi> whereas this is as true of infidels children as of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and therefore proves the one in Covenant as well the other,
and both these acts of little childeren are onely natural, not virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and so give not evidence of their being in covenant; nor doth
<hi>the Gospel give them large commendations beyond them of riper
years, making them the Rule of our perfection:</hi> For there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commendation of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. nor <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 3. nor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118327:19"/>
making them the rule of our perfection, any more than Sheep and
Doves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16. but onely those virtuous qualities, which
are resembled by their natural qualities are propounded to us as our
rule. His testimony out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> intimates that <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
said, <hi>There is no impediment to infants baptism, because the case
is clear,</hi> as if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would not have said it, had the case not
been clear, whereas it is more likely to be false than true, because
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> a Jesuit saith it; yea it is manifestly false; for the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
being onely to baptize Disciples, prohibits baptizing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
which are not such, but for want of being Disciples unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Baptism.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> in his fourth Argument will prove <hi>infant-baptism
commanded, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>because Nations are commanded to be
baptized.</hi> To this I answered before in the Dispute, and my answer
is, and was, Nations are not commanded to be baptized without any
other circumscription, but Disciples of the Nations, Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi>
confessed, <hi>pag.</hi> 48. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>is, <hi>Ye shall make Disciples,</hi> and then
baptizing is of Disciples. His speech, <hi>Infants are not uncapable
of Baptism, because they have not faith and repentance, because
Christ was baptized without repentance,</hi> is frivolous, for there is
not the same end of Christs Baptism and ours, and therefore though
repentance were not required of him, yet it is of us, and the want
of it makes infants uncapable of Baptism. It is false, that <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no more of persons in Covenant, and born of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
to their Baptism, but a meer objective power or receptabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
as he cals it, as was in the world at its creation, or in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
which he new makes us.</hi> And it is meerly false, <hi>that
upon any such account as he speaks of, many whole families were
baptized, or that any infants were included.</hi> The very Texts which
speak of the baptizing of the housholds either there or elsewhere
speak of their <hi>fearing God, Acts</hi> 2. 2. that <hi>all the houseshould be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by</hi> Peters <hi>words, Acts</hi> 11. 14. <hi>had repentance and the like gift
with the Apostles,</hi> v. 17, 18. <hi>had the word spoken to them, Acts</hi>
16. 32. <hi>believed, v.</hi> 34, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 8. <hi>addicted themselves to the
Ministery of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 16, 15. Which shew no infants
were meant under the houshold, for they did none of these things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Cragg <hi>goes on Argument</hi> 5. They that are capable of the
Kingdom and the blessing which is the greater, are capable of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118327:19"/>
Baptism which is the lesser: But infants are capable of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and the blessing which is the greater: Therefore they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Baptism which is the lesser.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, The <hi>major</hi> is false: if it were true, it would
follow infants are capable of the Kingdom and the blessing, which
is the greater, therefore they are capable of the Lords Supper, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Ministery, Church-discipline, which are the less. Though
into the Kingdom of Heaven infants be admitted by God who
knows who are his without any visible expression, yet into the visible
Church persons are not admitted without visible testimony of their
faith, of which sort were all added to the Church <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47. Not
one of those Texts <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13. to <hi>17. Mark</hi> 9. 14, 36, 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.
2, 3, 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 14 15.<hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15, 16. seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
nor all joyntly prove, <hi>infants visible Church-members. The
kingdom of God, Mark</hi> 10. 14. is not the visible Church, for into
it such as are not humble, as little children may enter, which our
Saviour denies, <hi>v.</hi> 15. but the same with the Kingdom, <hi>v. 23, 24,
25. into which it is so hard and impossible for a rich man or one
that trusts in riches to enter,</hi> which is called <hi>v.</hi> 17, 30 <hi>eternal
life.</hi> It is false, that Christ saith, <hi>The Angels</hi> of little ones in age
<hi>see the face of his Father which is in Heaven;</hi> But of little ones
in spirit, who are converted and believe in Christ, <hi>Matth,</hi> 18. 3, 6,
10. for whose sake they are sent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. They are but Paede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
dreams, that the three Evangelists recorded Christs blessing
little ones to check Antipaedobaptists, or to declare that which
Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> cals <hi>a precious truth,</hi> though it be a very ly, and may
be gathered to be so even from the story. For sure if infants had
been to be baptized, Christ would have then appointed them to be
baptized, and blamed his Apostles for not doing it. And therefore
Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> questions are answered by questions. 1. <hi>Doth
Christ take children in his arms. and would be have all put out of
his visible Church? Answ.</hi> Doth Christ no more but take
them up in his arms, lay his hands on them, and bless them? And
shall we presume to do more without any warrant of his, even to
admit them into his visible Church by Baptism? 2. <hi>Would he
have us receive them in his Name, and yet not receive them into
his visible Church, &amp;c? Answ:</hi> Where doth Christ ever bid us
receive little children in age? Where did he ever send them, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118327:20"/>
they might be received in his name? must we make Christs words
to import that which we would in another censure as a spice of
madnesse, when he hath told us plainly they are his Apostles,
and other Preachers he hath sent whom we are to receive in his
name <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 41. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 48. though they are as mean and
contemptible as a little child? How should children be received
but by providing Nurses? would Christ have us provide Nurses
for little children? our Lord Christ expresseth a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to drink, as some part of the reception in his name <hi>Mark</hi>
9. 41. Is this a thing fit to entertain an infant with? This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to answer Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> frivolous questions. And in answer
to the words of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who is the godly and reverend
Divine he means, I say for my part, seeing the will of Christ is
that I must walk by, and his word that I must be judged by,
and he hath given so full a discovery of his will in this point, I
will boldly adventure to follow his rule to baptize disciples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
faith, and had rather answer him upon his own incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
for not admitting by baptism those he never appointed to
be baptized, than to adventure upon the doing like <hi>Uzzah</hi> upon
mine own head that which doth prophane the ordinance of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
and corrupt the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Craggs <hi>sixt argument is;</hi> Infants are disciples; therefore
they may be baptized.</p>
               <p>The antecedent he would prove from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. in that it
was circumcision which was the yoke, which he proves from <hi>ver.</hi> 5.
But he confesseth it was not circumcision only, but the attendants,
and that it is no shift, but a cleer truth, that it is not circumcision
as acted on infants, but as taught, imposed on the consciences of
believing Gentiles, with the rest of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, as necessary
to salvation by some teachers (which cannot be said of infants)
is so manifest from the text, that I dare boldly say, they that
assert that by disciples <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. are meant, do but wrangle
against cleer light, and spit against the Sun. That the text <hi>Isai.</hi>
54. 13. is not meant of infants of believing parents, as such, but
of such as having <hi>heard and learned of the Father come to
Christ,</hi> is plain from those words of our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 6. 45.
alleged here by Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> himself, as expounding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118327:20"/>The seventh argument is,<hi>All that have faith may be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
But some infants have faith; Therefore some infants may
be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">But 1. the <hi>major</hi> is not true of faith onely in seed, or act secret,
and not made known.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> alters the Conclusion, which should have been
That all infants of believers may be baptized; But then he durst
not avouch the <hi>minor,</hi> that they all have saith, at least <hi>in semine</hi>
the contrary being manifest from Scripture and experience, He
proves his <hi>minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. From <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. where he saith, <hi>Christ expresly calls
them believers.</hi> But Christ calls not little children in age belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<hi>ver.</hi> 6. it had been ridiculous to threaten so heavy a doom to
the offending of little children in age, who are offended with none
so much as Nurses for dressing, or chiding them when they cry:
but the Apostles and other Christian disciples are there meant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are said to receive the Kingdome of God</hi> Mark 10.
<hi>that is, the grace of God, remission of sins, and life eternal;
now the Kingdome is not received, but by faith in Christ.</hi>
But onely elect infants dying do receive the Kingdom, either by
faith in the seed, not in the act, or by faith in the act secret only, and
yet are not to be baptized till they make profession, not are all or
any children of believers, as theirs, elect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saith Mr. <hi>Cragg, They please God, therefore Christ
blesseth them; but without faith it is impossible to please God.
Answ.</hi> The like argument is urged by the Remonstrants at the
Synod at <hi>Dort,</hi> It is impossible to please God without faith,
therefore election which supposeth pleasing of God presupposeth
faith; The answer is, that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. the pleasing of God is
meant of the works, as <hi>Enoch</hi> pleased God walking with him, and
so infants please not God, and therefore may be without faith,
not of the persons, in which sense infants may please God, that
is be beloved with a love of benevolence, though not of delight,
without faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Faith must be allowed them, or not salvation, for faith pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyeth
the heart</hi> Acts 15. 9. <hi>and no unclean thing shall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heaven. Answ.</hi> Faith in the seed is sufficient to make them
clean, which is not denyed may be in infants, though neither <hi>Isai.</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:118327:21"/>
65. 20. sayes any such thing, and <hi>Austins</hi> words express nothing
but his own conceit according to the language of his time, but
faith in seed or act unknown doth not intitle to baptism.</p>
               <p>The eighth Argument was answered before by denying the
<hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor,</hi> and his calling those that expound 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14.
of legitimation <hi>gross Anabaptists</hi> doth but involve <hi>Melancthon,
Camerarius, Musculus,</hi> &amp;c. in the same censure, and that it
is <hi>no bastard,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> called it, but a genuine exposition is
demonstrated at large in my <hi>Anti-paedobaptism first part,</hi> and
tis granted, <hi>That Pagans children are holy in the Apostles sense</hi>
if lawfully begotten; for the sanctifiedness of the yoke-fellow,
and holiness of the children is not ascribed to the faith of the one
parent, but to the conjugal relation between them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16.
<hi>The first fruits and root,</hi> are <hi>Abraham,</hi> not every believer, <hi>The
lump and branches</hi> are <hi>Abrahams</hi> children by election and
faith, not every believers, nor all <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural children:
and the holiness is meant of saving holiness, not meer outward
visible holiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The breaking off and grassing in</hi> Rom. 11. 17. are meant of
the invisible Church, in which sense Parents and children are
not broken off or graffed in together. See my <hi>Anti. paedobap.
first part.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nineth Argument tells us <hi>Of dangerous absurdities if infants
should be out</hi> of Covenant under the Gospel. But this is not all
one as to be baptized; we may grant them to be in the Covenant of
grace, and yet not to be baptized, and to be baptized, and yet
not in the Covenant of grace. But let us view the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Infants <hi>(saith he)</hi> would be losers by Christs comming,
and in a worse condition than the jewish infants were, they with
the parents were admitted to the Seal of the Covenant, which
was Circumcision, and not Parents with Children to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I rather think that by being not admitted to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
the condition of Parents and Children is the better by
Christs comming, sith as Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> teacheth here page 100. <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
is the yoke</hi> Acts 15. 10. of which the Apostle saith,
<hi>Neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear it,</hi> and is so farr
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118327:21"/>
from being the seal of the Covenant of Grace, that (they are Mr.
<hi>Craggs</hi> own words) <hi>Circumcision was the seal or ordinance by
which the Jews were bound to observe the doctrine and the Law,</hi>
meaning of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But were it imagined a pure Evangelical privilege, yet sure
it is not such a privilege, but Parents and Children did well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, afore <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and all the females from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
daies till Christs. I suppose what ever privilege it were, it
was abundantly recompensed by Christs comming without infant-baptism,
except a meer empty title of visible Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which yet will not stand them so much in stead, as to admit
them to the Lords Supper, be such an inestimable treasure as is
not recompensed with the glory of the Gospel now exhibited to
spiritual persons, in spiritual benefits by the Spirit, instead of
the carnall Promises, Ordinances, and Church-state of the
Law.</p>
               <p>The second is answered already, though infants be not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
Grace is larger under the Gospel being extended to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
in all nations, then under the Law to the <hi>Israelites</hi> and some
few Proselytes.</p>
               <p>The third is a speech that hath neither truth, nor sobriety of
expression, nor proof, it is but a bugbear to affright the ignorant
people to make use of such as he is, and to make odious them that
will not baptize infants, as counting them as vile as the children
of <hi>Turks, Tartars,</hi> or <hi>Canniballs,</hi> even as they make them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that will not burie their dead, as not affording them
Christian burial (though they are buried as Christ was without a
Priest,) but burying as dogs. But we know how to put a difference
between Believers and Pagans children in regard of the love God
bears to us, some promises he hath made to us concerning them,
the hopefullnesse of them by reason of prayers, education, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
society, confirmed by many experiences that are comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
all which things we should be contented with and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
for want of an imaginary privilege, which is indeed no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,
but a dammage to our children.</p>
               <p>I for my part look upon the children of believers unsprinkled,
as precious, and rather more hopeful than those that are. And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118327:22"/>
I think Mr. <hi>Cragg,</hi> as hard a conceit as he hath of the Anabaptists
and their children, yet would he be ashamed to say as he doth
here of them, <hi>That they are as vile as the children of</hi> Turks, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
<hi>or</hi> Cannibals.</p>
               <p>But that which he closeth with, sheweth he was minded to
affright the poor ignorant people, as the Popish Priests did of
old.</p>
               <p>Fourthly <hi>(saith he)</hi> They would be without God, without
Christ, without hope in the world; not the children of God, but
would all be damned, for out of covenant and visible Church
(ordinarily) there is no salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By Covenant, he means doubtless no other than the
outward covenant, which is not shewed to be any other than
baptism, and indeed we do no otherwise put them out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
than by denying them baptism; which being presupposed,
Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> speech must needs imply, that denying baptism inferrs
all this. Which cannot be true without conceiving, <hi>That all
that are unbaptized are without God, without Christ, without
hope in the world, not the children of God, but of the Devil,
will be all damned, have no salvation.</hi> Which is not only more
than what the Epistler makes hainous in me, all that would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
must be baptized after profession (though it were understood
by me onely of necessity of precept, which Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> himself
asserts to be imported <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.) but worse than <hi>Austin</hi>
sayes, whom Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> himself called the hard Father of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
and saies went too far, worse than the Papists themselves
speak of the dying unbaptized. Which shews that he preached
this Sermon with a bitter and furious spirit.</p>
               <p>His closing speech [<hi>out of Covenant and visible Church (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily)
there is no salvation.</hi>] if understood of the Covenant of
saving according to election, I grant, that neither ordinarily, nor
extraordinarily is there salvation: if of the outward Covenant
(as they call it) that is, the outward administration of Seals, it
is certain there may be salvation, unless profane contempt or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
neglect against conscience do hinder salvation.</p>
               <p>The speech, <hi>out of the Church is no salvation,</hi> hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by Protestants of the invisible Church. A person of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118327:22"/>
years that believes, though he be joined to no particular visible
Church, if there be not prophane contempt, or wilful neglect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
conscience, may be saved. But they that are only negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or privatively out of the Church visible, meerly for want of age
to understand the faith, and ability to make profession, may ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
if by it be meant frequently, constantly be saved, though
they be not ordinarily saved as [ordinarily] notes ordinary means,
preaching the word and profession of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His last argument is,</hi> That which hath continued since the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
times with blessed success, must needs be lawful; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism
hath continued with blessed success since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times;
Ergo.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is denyed. The blessed success he proves not. In
my <hi>Exercitation</hi> I shew many errours and corruptions which have
come from it, not by accident in respect of some persons that
imbraced it only, but even from the tendency of the practice it
self. I may ruly say that Paedobaptism hath been as cursed a
root of corrupting the Churches, and losing the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
conferred at first commonly at baptism by laying on of hands,
as I think (except some few) any other corruption in the rites of
Christian Religion. But Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> thinks to draw it down from
the Apostles daies.</p>
               <p>He begins with words of <hi>Dionysius Areopagita, holy men
have received a tradition of the Fathers,</hi> which very words shew
it was not <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 17. he would
doubtless have said, I have received it from blessed <hi>Paul,</hi> not have
told what other holy men have received from the Fathers, whom
Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> vainly conceives to be meant of the Apostles. But the
books that go under his name have been so often by so many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, Papists and Protestants proved to be meer counterfeits,
that either it is much ignorance, or much impudence that this is
produced as his.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salmasius</hi> sundry times speaketh of them as certain, that the
Author of them was not till the fifth age. The Apostolical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
appear by many observations of <hi>Scultetus,</hi> and others,
not to have been written by <hi>Clement,</hi> but of much later time.
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> his words make nothing for Mr. <hi>Cragg,</hi> as he cites them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118327:23"/>
nor as they stand in his own works. <hi>Origens</hi> speeches are in the
<hi>Latin</hi> books translated by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> into which many things were
foisted by him, and these its probable were so as being so expresse
against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> nor do I find he was ever alleged by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi>
who gathered the most Ancient testimonies he could for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
sin and infant-baptism. Therefore saith <hi>Vossius</hi> in his
<hi>Theses</hi> of infant-baptism, <hi>We less care for Origen, because they
are not in Greek. Cyprians</hi> testimony is granted to be in the third
Century, and <hi>Ambroses</hi> and <hi>Austins,</hi> and the <hi>Milevitan</hi>
Councils and innumerable more, but all upon the Popish errours
of giving grace, and the necessity to save a child from damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> before him disswade from
it, except in case of danger of death in appearance near: out of
which case the Ancients did not baptize infants, and in that case
the communion was given them: But otherwise they baptized not
infants, no not of believing parents, till they came to years, and
then they were first catechized in <hi>Lent,</hi> and then solemnly baptized
at <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> as may be gathered even from the
Common Prayer Book in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> before baptism.</p>
               <p>It is most false <hi>that all ages, all Churches agree in infant-baptism.</hi>
Some Churches never had it, some Churches five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years ago of the most godly and learned that then were,
did oppose it, and practice the baptism of believers only. If
Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and others did account Anabaptists hereticks, it was
for other tenents than this. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself saith no sober
Divine did ever <hi>reckon the Anabaptists as hereticks meerly for
the errour of rebaptizing, Plain Scripture proof, &amp;c. part</hi> 1.
<hi>chap.</hi> 1. Yet Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> bespatters Anti-paedobaptism thus, <hi>it robs
the Scripture of its truth, infants of their right, parents of
their comforts, the Church of its members, Christ of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
God of his glory.</hi> Sure he hath learned the art of him in
the <hi>Comaedian</hi> to calumniate boldly, imagining somewhat will
be believed, though there be not a word true. But there is more
of this venome behind; <hi>That it is the mother of many other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours;
Hence sprung the Ranters, Socinians, Antitrinitarians,
Shakers, Levellers, they that are above Ordinances, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripturians.</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:118327:23"/>
Will any believe that from the tenet which doth
so stifly maintain an Ordinance should spring the errour of being
above Ordinances? Or that the errour of Antiscripturians should
spring from that tenet which doth so strictly insist on the Scripture?
Let Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> shew any the least connexion between Antipaedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism
and the errours he names, and he saith something, else if
only the persons, and not the tenet be guilty of these errours he
doth but calumniate. He might with like reason say, The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
religion is the mother of many other errours; hence sprung
<hi>Ebionites, Cerinthians, Nicolaitans, Gnosticks, &amp;c.</hi> Such
kind of criminations are most stinking and base slanders; unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a sober minded man, much more a Divine in a pulpit, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to many people who examine not but take all for true, which
such <hi>Rabbins</hi> talk with confidence. The like may I say of the
judgements of God. Those in <hi>Germany</hi> were by war, the events
that have happened in our daies should teach us to be sparing in
our judging. Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> speech was according to his prejudice.
<hi>Solomon Eccles.</hi> 9. 1, 2. <hi>Christ Luke</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. teach us more
sobriety than so easily to pronounce of Gods judgements. If we
should judge of men and tenents by outward judgements, <hi>Job</hi>
had been condemned justly. One man had his house burned that
did not sprinkle his child, thousands have had their houses burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
who did, and perhaps upon occasion of that abuse, by means
of provision for the feast. May not we as well say. God thereby
judged against infant-sprinkling? Thousands have prospered after
their refusing to baptize infants, thousands have fain into calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
after they have baptized them. May not we this way as well
decide for Antipaedobaptists as against them? Divines that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Scriptures to be their rule should not thus judge of what
is true or false by Gods dealing with mens persons, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon secret reason, not discemable by us, but by his word
which is our rule, and wherein he hath revealed his mind. The
rest of Mr. <hi>Craggs</hi> speech is as vain. Doth this benefit come to
parents, and children by infant baptism, that God is not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be called their God, and the God of their seed after them,<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. what a ridiculous conceit is this? The text saith, that
through the faith of the persons it is, that God is not ashamed to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118327:24"/>
be called their God, not their God, and the God of their seed,
much less a word of infant-baptism, as if such a benefit came by
it. All the benefit he talks of that comes to infants is either a
meer empty title, or else it comes to infants as well without baptism
as with it. The Devils dealing if it be, as Mr. <hi>Cragg</hi> saith, makes
it appear the faith is good into which the pretended baptism is, but
not that the Baptism is right.</p>
               <p>Enough of this frothy, unconcocted Sermon, calculated for
the ignorant and superstitious common people, and the profane
loose Gentry, who mind not godliness in earnest, and for the
blind Teachers of those parts, who know not the Gospel, but
mind their own profits more than the understanding of the truth.
From whom the Lord deliver the dark parts of this Land, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
teachers for the people after his own heart, that it be not as
now it is in too many parts, <hi>The blind lead the blind, and both
fall into the ditch.</hi>
