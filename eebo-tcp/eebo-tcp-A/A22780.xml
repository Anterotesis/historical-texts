            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9218:17"/>
yf I haue no ſones but doughters

from my father or his bloode,
they ſhall neuer deſcende to my hey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res
by my mothers ſyde.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſe a greate difference in
this behalfe, bytwene purchaſed
landes and landes which deſcende
from my anuceſtour.</p>
            <p>Yf there be thre ſones, and the
myddell ſone purchaſeth landes, &amp;
dye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out iſſue, theldeſt ſhall haue
the landes, and not the yongeſt.</p>
            <p>Alſo it is a principle in our lawe,
that none can be myne heyre of lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
that I hold in fee ſimple, onles
he be myne heyre by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole bloode / 
for yf a man hath iſſue, two or thre

dyeth without iſſue, his halfe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb facs="tcp:9218:18"/>
ſhall not haue the lande, but
it ſhall go to his vncle. Lykewyſe
yf a man hath by his fyrſt wyfe a
ſone and a doughter, and by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde

landes in fee, and dyeth without

by diſcent, as heyre to her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not to the yonger brother.
Otherwyſe it is of landes entayled
as ſhall be hereafter ſpecifyed.</p>
            <p>Alſo yf a man be ſeiſed of landes
in fee ſimple, and hath iſſue a ſone
and doughter by one wyfe, &amp; a ſone
by another, and dyeth, and theldeſt
ſone entreth i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the landes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dyeth without iſſue, the dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſhall haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> landes and not the
yongeſt ſone, &amp; yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yongeſt ſone is
heyre to his father, but he is not ſo
to his brother. But yf in this caſe
<pb facs="tcp:9218:19"/>
theldeſt ſone had not entred after
the deth of his father but had died
before any entre made by hym, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhall not the ſyſter germayne entre
but the yonger brother as heyre to
his father, bicauſe theldeſt brother
was neuer in actuall poſſeſſyon,
which is requiſyte to that perſone
that claymeth to be heyre collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.
But to the lyniall heyres, it
ſuffyſeth that the aunceſtout ſhold
haue ben heyre yf he had lyued / I
meane as thus. A man is ſeaſed of
landes, and hath iſſue, a ſone and
doughter by one wyfe, and a ſone
by another / he dyeth / theldeſt ſone
entreth not, but dieth without iſſue
before he can make any actuall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree
/ his ſyſter ſhall not haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
as heire to her brother, bicauſe
her brother was neuer actually
poſſeſſed / but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yonger brother ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:9218:19"/>
haue them as heyre to his father.
Yet yf theldeſt ſone in that caſe had
lefte behynd him iſſue of his body,
whether it had bene ſone or dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
this iſſue notwithſtandynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

doughter is linial heyre, where as
the brother, ſyſter, vncle, aunte. &amp;c.
be heyres collateral, and ſo obſerue
a dyuerſitie.</p>
            <p>I call an actuall poſſeſſyon, whan
a man entreth in dede in to landes
to hym deſcended, but a poſſeſſyon
in lawe, is called whan landes be
deſcended to a perſone, and he hath
not yet really and actually entred
into them. For notwithſtandynge
that he is not in actuall poſſeſſyon
yet he is poſſeſſed in the lawe / that

            <p>Ye ſhall vnderſtande that this

            <p>Fee tayle is whan it is lymytted

As I gyue landes to a man and to
his heyres and go no further, this
is fee ſimple: but yf I make a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitacion,
and adde of his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goten,
now is it fee tayle / that is to

yf I gyue landes to a man and to

yf I gyue landes to him and to his

he hath but a fee tayle / foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moche

the gyuer or his heyres.</p>
            <p>But ye muſte obſerue that there
be two kyndes of fee tayle. There
is a generall tayle, and a ſpecyall
tayle. Fee tayle gn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rall is as where

heyres of his body begoten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expreſſynge by what woman
they are to be begote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore
Yf a man be tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te in the generall

&amp; he taketh an other wyfe, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of theſe iſſues is inheritable to this

in the gyfte by what woman the

an eſpecyall tayle: as yf landes be

(and ſhe we not by what man) this
is a generall tayle / but yf I adde &amp;
ſaye by ſuche a man her huſbande,
than is it an eſpecyall tayle.</p>
            <p>Alſo yf I gyue landes to a man

               </gap>
of theyr two bodyes lawfully bego<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten:
this is an eſpecyall tayle / as
well in the huſbande as my wyfe.</p>
            <p>Semblably it is, if a man gyueth
landes to an other man with his
doughter or kynſwoman in franke
maryage, this i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plyeth a ſtate tayle
eſpeciall / and as well the man as
the woman hathe eſtate in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

            <p>But yf I gyue landes to a man
<pb facs="tcp:9218:22"/>
and to a woman, and to his heyres
that he ſhall begete of her / here the
woman hath eſtate but for terme
of her lyfe, &amp; the huſbande an eſtate
in the eſpeciall tayle. In lykewyſe
it is on the womans behalfe: as yf
I gyue landes to a man and his
wyfe, and to her heyres of the body
of her ſayd huſbande engendred / 
he hath an eſtate but for terme of
lyfe, and ſhe an eſtate in the ſpeciall

            <p>Ye ſhall alſo vnderſtande, that if
landes be gyuen to a man, &amp; to the

female ſhall neuer inheryte.</p>
            <p>Finally it is to be noted, that of
landes wiche a man hath in fee
ſimple, the poſſeſſion of the brother
ſhall cauſe the ſyſter germayne to
inherite / and not the brother by the
halfe blode, as here to fore was ſaid
but of landes entayled otherwiſe it
is. Therfore yf a man be ſeiſed of
landes in the generall tayle, &amp; hath
iſſue by his fyrſt wyfe a ſone and a
doughter, and a ſone by an other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wyſe,
and dyeth / and theldeſt ſone
entreth i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> landes and dyeth the
ſyſter germayne ſhall not haue the
landes, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yonger brother of the

ſhall inheryte landes in tayle, muſt
clayme them as next and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

whome the landes were fyrſte
<pb facs="tcp:9218:23"/>

            <p>Ye ſhall vnderſtande that by the

Semblably it is where as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

dyuers cuſtomes &amp; vſages whiche
other townes haue not. For ſome
burghes haue a cuſtome, that the

            <p>¶A tenaunte in vyllenage is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

(whoſe bondman he is) certayne
landes or tenementes, accordynge

the demene landes of his lorde / or
to do ſuche lyke ſeruyle or villayne

by ſuche maner of ſeruyce / &amp; theyr

and yet they them ſelues be no vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laynes.
For the lande holden in vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenage
maketh not the tenaunte a
villayne, but contrarye wyſe a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne
maye make free lande to be
villayne lande vnto his lorde. As if
a villayne purchaſeth lande in fee
ſimple or in fee tayle, the lord of the

ſo purcaſed by his bondman, &amp; put
hym and his heyres out for euer / 
and this done, the lorde yf he wyll
may leaſe the ſame lande to his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne
to holde of hym in villenage.</p>
            <p>And here ye ſhall vnderſtande,
that ſeruitute or villenage, is thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce,
not of the lawe of nature

<hi>Ius gentium,</hi> by whiche a man is

            <p>They be made vyllaynes two

as whan a free man beynge of full

            <p>Or elles by the lawes of armes cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led

            <p>And ye ſhall note that vyllaynes

that whan they be taken in

            <p>Nowe as I ſayd by the lawe of
