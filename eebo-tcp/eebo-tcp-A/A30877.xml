            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHat ſhould be the ſcope of putting forth this my not ſufficient Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Treatiſe, after ſo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Learned Writings of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> the Title before will declare unto thee, <hi>viz.</hi> That my Deſign was both out of the Ancient and Modern, to extract the very Marrow, and plainly to ſhew the beſt way of Curing Diſeaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Chirurgery: Therefore I have purpoſed not to obtrude upon thee this or that Man's Fancy,
<pb facs="tcp:52336:3"/>
or Conceit, for Modern Practice: For who ever was ſo mad as to Embrace the Opinion of any one Region, City, or Man? Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though moſt ingenious and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, equally excelled in all the Parts of his Profeſſion? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath not pleaſed the Giver of all Arts to grant this perfectneſs to Men: But I reſolve to ſet down that Practice which Reaſon and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, after a diligent Reading of the beſt Authors, and an exact obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſeveral Operations, have Taught me to be the ſafeſt, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienteſt and eaſieſt, for prolixity I have purpoſely avoided, and uſed not more words than only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the thing it ſelf. Nevertheleſs I have ſtudied to conprehend the Foundation of the Art in few Chapters. Read over all diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let not what I purpoſely
<pb facs="tcp:52336:3"/>
omitted trouble thee: Great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns eaſily affright the Reader, as thoſe that are too little betrays him: I have carefully endeavoured, what is hardly found, a mean; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have rather in few words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted my Obſervations, in the very deſcriptions of the Diſeaſes, then to waſte thy time with a prolix diſcourſe: To this end, that I might not repeat in particular Diſeaſes, what I had once ſet down in generals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tumors, Wounds,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> which neither in Cauſe nor Cure differ, I have reduced under one Head, contrary to what moſt Writers uſe to do, who only from the difference of the Part and Member affected, difference the Diſeaſes, which aftewards gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them new names, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any benefit multiply, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:52336:4"/>
they render that Art which is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult enough of it ſelf, much more difficult. The moſt diligent of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents can ſcarce diſtinguiſh them, who unprofitably ſpend much labour and time, in the Controverſies of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients concerning the Name, whoſe Opinions they ſuppoſe they ought to follow to a Tittle, if they will arrive at the degree of Doctor. We are the Miniſters of Nature, not the Slaves of thoſe Men that deſcribe it: We account neither them Prophets, nor their Writings ſacred, neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to add, or diminiſh to them without the name <hi>Heretick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſet down both few, and many Medicaments; for thoſe that I have produced, although few in number, yet of great vertue, which by vaſt pains, and no leſs charges I have found out, and which dayly
<pb facs="tcp:52336:4"/>
Practice hath confirmed to me, as the ſafeſt of all. Other Medicines ſeek for amongſt others.</p>

                     <p>ALthough the word <hi>Chirurgery</hi> ſignifies all <hi>Manual Operations</hi> in general; yet, by reaſon of its pre-eminence above all the reſt, it is now only given to that <hi>Art,</hi> which endeavours to remove the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of the Body, by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that External Accidents require not only the help of the <hi>Hands,</hi> but alſo <hi>Internal</hi> Means; therefore it is no wonder for a Part of Phyſick to require the whole: <hi>Chirurgery</hi> being a Part, which depends upon the Body of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi>: But theſe internal Medicines we impart to you, not as <hi>Chirurgeons,</hi> but as <hi>Phyſicians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The General Operations of this Art, to which all the particular ones may be reduced, are of four ſorts:</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. Of the Nature, Difference, Signs, Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks and Cure of Fractures in general.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Fracture is a Solution of Continuity in the hard parts of the Body, cauſed by an hard Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment externally forced upon the part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, 1. From the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; there being ſome tranſverſe, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Fractures</hi>; others that are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length of the Bone, called <hi>Fiſſures</hi>: and others are <hi>Comminutions,</hi> when the Bone is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52336:9"/>
broken into many ſmall parts. 2. From the <hi>Part,</hi> it being ſome times in the Head, ſometimes in the Shoulders, Ribs, Arms, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. From the <hi>Accidents</hi>; there being ſometimes a Wound accompanying it; at other times, a Diſlocation, Inflamation, Gangrene, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe</hi>] is, Whatever is able to break, bruiſe, or cut: Sometimes alſo a Bone corrupted by the Pox, Gout, or otherwiſe, hath been broken without any external force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] A Bone being tranſverſly or oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke, by handling it, you perceive an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality; the Patient is ſcarce able to move the Part affected, and ſometimes that Part is ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the other; the Thigh, Leg or Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, the Patient cannot ſtand at all; but he may ſomewhat, though with pain, in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location: And this is the ſureſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Fracture and a Diſlocation. A <hi>Fiſſure</hi> is diſcerned by the thickneſs, pain and uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Part, and requireth the judgment of a skilful Chirurgion. A <hi>Comminution</hi> is eaſie to be perceived, the Bone being very unequal, and here and there yielding to the Fingers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſticks</hi>] A <hi>Tranſverſe</hi> Fracture is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to cure than an <hi>Oblique</hi>; or when accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with apparent Inequalities; <hi>that,</hi> where but one Bone is broken, than where two are, or where the Bones are much ſhattered; <hi>that,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s made in the midſt of the Bone, than what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be near the Head; and a ſingle one, than a compound. If the Patient remain undreſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſeventh day, the Member is in danger of mortifying, eſpecially if that the Part be too <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ard bound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52336:10"/>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] A broken Bone requires theſe four Operations; <hi>Extention, Conjoining, Ligature, Well-placing</hi>; and withal, the application of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward Remedies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Extention</hi> can hardly be performed without pain; which yet will be much leſs, if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be ſo extended, that the Muſcles do not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; that is to ſay, The Part muſt be ſo laid, that when <hi>in health,</hi> they could hold out longeſt without tiring. Sometimes the extenſion muſt be greater, ſometimes leſſer; which will be performed aright, if regard be had to the time of the Fracture, to the Age of the Patient, and to the greatneſs of the Bone. A recent Fracture, a tender Patient, a ſmall Bone, require a gentler Extention: on the contrary, an old Fracture, a ſtrong Patient, and a big Bone, a greater. The manner of extending I deſcribe not, becauſe it is better learnt by the frequent view of Practice, than by Reading.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Extention,</hi> you are to join the Bones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; in the doing of which, the Muſcles muſt not be wreſted, but retain their natural poſition and figure.</p>
                     <p>Then the Part muſt be bound with a double Rowler; the <hi>firſt</hi> is to be rowled thrice about the Fracture, and then upwards. The <hi>(ſecond</hi> (which muſt be twice as long) is to be once wound about the Fracture, proceeding down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and then upwards again, a little higher than the firſt Rowler; to which you will give more firmneſs, if you bind ſome convenient Splints (of Wood, or rather of Paſt-board) round about the Member.</p>
                     <p>The Ligature ought not to be too ſtrait, leſt it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52336:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſe pain, and rob the Part of its nouriſhment; nor too looſe, leſt the Bones ſlip out of their place. And unleſs great pain, or other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms require, it muſt not be opened before the <hi>third</hi> day; and at the <hi>ſecond</hi> dreſſing, it muſt be bound ſomewhat cloſer; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards changed but once every four, five or ſix dayes.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Part ought to be <hi>well placed,</hi> that is, ſoftly, evenly, and a little raiſed. If you lay it too low, the Bone will bend outwards; if too high, it will bend inwards: Wherefore you muſt obſerve a mean.</p>
                     <p>Now, whether theſe four Operations have been duly performed, may be known by the enſuing Signs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Extention</hi> is well done, if the part be ſtrait, and as long as its fellow; if it appear to outward view every where even, and a little hollow about the Fracture.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>joining together</hi> is duly made, if the Bone be any thing firm, and all about the Fracture be found equal.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ligature</hi> is as it ought to be, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as ſoon as he is dreſſed, find the pain aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; if the pain do ſomewhat encreaſe the firſt and ſecond night, and there be perceived the third day, without the place of binding, a little ſwelling yielding to your hands.</p>
                     <p>The Bone is <hi>well placed,</hi> if in the ſecond dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you find all even.</p>
                     <p>Before you rowl the Ligature about the Member, bathe the part with Spirit of Wine or Red Wine; or, with Oyl, Wine and Vinegar mix'd together; Or, take the White of an Egg,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52336:11"/>
with ſome Bolus, Frankincenſe, Dragons-Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or anoint it with Oyl of Roſes, Mirtles, Violets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or lay Plaiſters on it. In Winter, the <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> will do well: At all times that which follows;</p>
                     <p>Take Maſtick, Frankincenſe, of each two drams, Aloes, Gum Tragacanth, Dragons-Blood, Bole-Armonick, of each a one dram; <hi>Lapis Haematitis,</hi> Burnt Talch, of each one dram; Whites of Eggs, and Oyl of Roſes, as much as is ſufficient. Make it into a Plaiſter.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Wound</hi> accompany the Fracture, then ought you to extend the Part firſt (yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what gentler than in a ſimple Fracture) then you are to join the Bones together; next, to obſerve the Wound, to bring the Lips thereof together with Plaiſters, rather than with a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and to guard it with a Defenſive: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rowl the Part, and lay it conveniently.</p>
                     <p>If there be a <hi>Cominution,</hi> or great ſhattering of the Bones joined with the Wound, then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with Forceps to remove the ſmall looſe Bones, leaving thoſe to Nature that are yet any way fixed; for ſhe will, though ſomewhat later, of her ſelf throw them out; and ſometimes ſhe will unite them again to the whole. Yet, to forward her, you may aſſiſt Nature with the following Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Take Aſhes of Earth-worms, three drams; Virgins-Honey, an ounce and half, mix them, and make an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Aloes, Myrrhe, of each half a dram; Roots of Comfrey the great, Round-Birthwort, of each three drams, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> two drams;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52336:11"/>
Turpentine and Wax, as much as is ſufficient, with a little Oyl of Lillies, to make it into an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>If the Bone be <hi>bare,</hi> cover it with its own skin and Nuſcles, and defend it from the Air as much as is poſſible.</p>
                     <p>If it be <hi>bare</hi> and alſo <hi>ſtarted out,</hi> endeavour to reduce it again into its place; but if it be got out too far, take away the pieces thus ſtarted out, with Saw or Nippers.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe Manual Operations being well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Patient muſt obſerve a good Diet; open a Vein upon occaſion, and afterwards purge the Blood. In the Fractures of the lower parts, purging is not convenient; but if the Patients Belly be bound, he muſt take a Suppoſitory.</p>
                     <p>In the Fractures of the upper parts, Purging or adminiſtring Clyſters, is oftner neceſſary, and may be done by the enſuing compounded or ſimple Medicines, which may alſo ſerve you in all other Accidents that we may deſcribe in this whole Treatiſe.</p>

                     <p>THe Fractures of the <hi>Skull</hi> are divided into ſix ſeveral kinds; A <hi>Fiſſure, Contuſion, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, Inciſion, Puncture</hi> and <hi>Contra fiſſure.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Fiſſure</hi> is made by a hard and blunt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and paſſeth ſometimes through both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſometimes through one only.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Contuſion</hi> is made, when by a hard and blunt Inſtrument the Skull is ſo hurt, that it appears whole from without, but yet is ſever'd from the

whole within: Which yet in little Children may be done without a Fracture.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fracture</hi> is made, when a part of the Skull is ſeparated from the whole.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Inciſion</hi> is made by a cutting Inſtrument; where ſometimes one part of the Bone is rais'd up and ſeparated, as it were, but is yet faſt to the reſt of the Bone; ſometimes a part is quite taken away; ſometimes there remains a mark in the Bone according to the Figure of the Inſtrument.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Puncture</hi> is made by a pungent or thruſting Inſtrument, and ſeldom paſſeth through both Tables.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Contra-fiſſure</hi> is made, when the part ſtruck remaining whole, the oppoſite part is cleft.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are, Swimming of the Head, dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Eyes, Vomiting, Bleeding at the Mouth, Noſe and Ears. The Patient grows dumb, and ſuddenly falls to the ground: whereupon follows Raving, a Feaver, Convulſions, Palſie. Any hard thing, as a piece of Wood, a Spoon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being put into his Mouth, he is not at all, or hardly able to bite upon it. Here it muſt alſo be carefully enquired, in what manner, and with what Inſtrument he hath been hurt? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be young or old, tender or ſtrong, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or unhealthy? Preſently after the Fall or Stroke, before the Part ſwells, you may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feel the hurt with your Fingers; and if there be a Wound with it, you may either ſee it, or find it out with a <hi>Probe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] The Fractures of the Skull, how fair ſoever they may look, is never without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but more dangerous, when both the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are hurt or broken; and more dangerous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52336:16"/>
yet, if the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and moſt dangerous, if the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> be alſo hurt. The more Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms there are, the leſs hope of a good event. If the Bone grow black in the beginning, that is a mortal Sign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] If the Skin be yet whole, or the wound not large enough, make a croſs inciſion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> If under it you find a fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, put ſome Ink into it, and bind up the wound. The ſecond day, or as ſoon as the bleeding is ceaſed, ſcrape the Skull at once, or at ſeveral times, until the Ink with the Fiſſure is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gone, and the Bone grow ſomewhat bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then throw the enſuing Powder upon it.</p>
                     <p>Take Dragons Blood, burnt Harts-horn, of each one dram and half; Myrrhe half a dram; Frankincenſe, and Orriſe roots, of each a dram; Make it into a very fine Powder.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Fiſſure</hi> paſs through both Tables, then are you to make uſe of Trepanning; as likewiſe in the <hi>Contra-fiſſure, Fracture</hi> and <hi>Contuſion</hi> of the Skull, or elſe you will quickly loſe your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Inciſion</hi> is healed like the <hi>Fiſſure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Puncture</hi> you muſt put the Trepan juſt in the middle, and not on the ſides of the place hurt.</p>
                     <p>If you find a Fracture with a Cominution, then take out all the ſmall looſe Bones, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Nature thoſe that are yet faſt to the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium,</hi> or cannot be taken away without force. And then if the Fracture be ſo large, that you can free the Brains from the coagulated or corrupted Blood, or from the pricking Bones, Trepanning will be needleſs; but if it ſhould happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52336:16"/>
you muſt, with great care, apply the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, unleſs the Patient be ſtrong, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very little. The manner of Trepanning will be taught in another place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In a Fracture of the Noſe, what is raiſed, is to be preſſed down; and what is preſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to be raiſed with a <hi>Spatule,</hi> or other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument: afterwards a Pipe or Quill is to be put up, and continually kept there, till the Cure be done, and a Fracture-Plaiſter is to be laid on without. If the Bone be not corrupted, it will be healed in ten or twelve days.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A broken <hi>Jaw-bone</hi> is reſtored by ones fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers uſed both within and without the Mouth; and if thoſe be too weak, then one is to draw the Head backward, and the Chirurgeon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo to put it in. It is cured in twenty days.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Clavicle</hi> being broken, there muſt be one to draw the Arm backward, and another to draw the Neck or Shoulder forward; the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon himſelf, in the mean time, drawing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what was fallen down, and downwards what was raiſed too high. If a Ball be put into the Arm-pit, and the Elbow be preſſed againſt the Ribs, the Operation will prove more eaſie. It is cured in twenty four days.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If the <hi>Shoulder-Blade</hi> be broken about the place where it is united to the <hi>Arm,</hi> then is the hurt for the moſt part incurable. If it break in the <hi>Acromion</hi> (which may be eaſily felt) then let the Arm or Shoulder be pulled down, either with Hands or Ligatures, and in the mean time ſet it in. If it be broken into ſeveral pieces, make an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and take them out, unleſs they be yet faſt to the <hi>Peri-eſtium</hi>; in which caſe, you muſt leave
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52336:17"/>
Nature to her ſelf, which will either make them unite again, or throw them out. It is healed in forty days.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Sternum,</hi> or Breaſt-bone happens ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>broken,</hi> and then you'll find an uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which being toucht, will yield to the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and cauſe ſome cracking; or to be preſſed in, and then you'll feel a bending inwards, which will cauſe pain, a ſhort breath, coughing and ſpitting blood. To reſtore the ſame, lay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient on his Back upon a great ſtone, preſſing both his Shoulders downwards; then preſs the Ribs backward and forward, until the Bone be reduced again in its right place. This is cured in twenty days.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A ſimple Fracture of the <hi>Ribs,</hi> which is without any great Contuſion, or Inflamation of the neighbouring parts, may be healed in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, applying the Fracture-Plaiſter. If the Ribs ſtand out, they muſt with ones Hand be preſſed in. If they bend inward, let the Patient keep in his Breath, and ſo preſs the Rib outward; in the mean time, aſſiſting him with your hand. If that ſucceed not, then lay a ſticking Plaiſter upon it, and pull the ſame off ſo often, until the Rib return into its place. Cupping-Glaſſes here are of no uſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. A ſimple Fracture of the Joynts of the <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> is eaſily ſet again with ones finger, and is made whole in twenty days. But if the Marrow of the Back-bone be ſo hurt or preſſed in, that the Arms or Legs of the Patient become lame or ſenſeleſs, that he cannot retain his Urine, or his Excrement, then he ſeldom eſcapeth death. Yet you are to do your utmoſt; and if one or more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52336:17"/>
ſmall Bones be altogether looſe from the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſtium,</hi> then make Inciſion, and take them out.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The ſame is to be underſtood of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> which alone hath this peculiar, that you may put your fingers into the <hi>Anus,</hi> and reſtore it to its right place.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Hip-bone</hi> being broken, is to be ſet as ſoon as poſſible may be, and then it will heal in twenty four days; otherwiſe you may expect various accidents. But if it be fractured into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pieces, then you are forthwith, in the firſt dreſſing, to make an Inciſion; take out the ſmall Splinters, and re-place thoſe that have yet any hold-faſt. Yet, by reaſon of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Tendons, Muſcles, Veins, Arteries and Nerves, that are ſpread over the whole part, ſuch an Inciſion cannot be made without great danger.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If the <hi>upper-Bone</hi> of the <hi>Arm</hi> be broken, firſt bend the Elbow toward the Breaſt, then take the lower part of that Bone cloſe to the Elbow, pulling it ſtraight down towards the ground, and ſo reſtore it; well obſerving here, that the Arm, during the whole time of Cure, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that poſture in which it was extended; otherwiſe the Fracture will, upon the leaſt change of its poſture, ſlip out again. Where yet 'tis to be underſtood, that the Chirurgeon after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third dreſſing, as often as after that he dreſſeth the Patient, muſt ſtretch out his Arm ſtrait, to the end that the Tendons which run from the Arm, and are inſerted below the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, ſhrinking by the long lying ſtill, may not cauſe a troubleſome ſtiffneſs. However, this ſhrinking of <hi>Tendons</hi> (which are by pretenders to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52336:18"/>
Chirurgery, ridiculouſly call'd <hi>Nerves</hi>) may yet conveniently be cured in two or three months, if you make the Patient to carry every day ſome weight, and endeavor to relax and mollifie the Tendons with Fomentations and Embrocations, abſtaining from the uſe of any Brandy, or any other corroborating and aſtringent Medicines. I have always found ſucceſsful the following Unguent.</p>
                     <p>Take Man's and Duck's Greaſe, of each one ounce; Oyntment of Marſh-mallows, half an ounce; Oyl of Earth-worms, white Lilly, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, of each two drams. Make an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>broken Bone</hi> is cured in forty days. The reſtoring of the broken Thigh-bone, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from this.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The <hi>Elbow</hi> hath two Bones; of which, the greater is called <hi>Radius,</hi> the leſſer <hi>Ulna</hi>; both <hi>Fociles</hi>: The ſmall <hi>Focile</hi> being broken, 'tis eaſie to reſtore it. The Cure is harder, when the great one is broken; and yet harder, when both are broken: In which caſe, the extention is to be made the ſtronger. When they be well ſet, and bound up, then muſt the hand be placed a little higher upon the Cheſt than the Elbow; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, every ſecond or third day (without pain or violence) the Arm is gently to be ſtretch'd out, to the end that the Humors flowing thither, and there ſtaying too long, may not cauſe a concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Bones, and a ſtiffneſs in the Arm, as not extenſible any more. It is cured in thirty days.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The <hi>Leg</hi> hath alſo two Bones, the greater called <hi>Tibia,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Fibula.</hi> Their Cure had nothing different from the next foregoing.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. If the <hi>Patella,</hi> or Knee-pan, break croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52336:18"/>
the Patient commonly remains lame. If it break long-ways, then by the Muſcles that draw upwards, without any great help of the hands, it is almoſt of it ſelf reſtored, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in twenty days.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. Of the Nature, Difference, Signs, Cauſes, Prognoſticks, and Cure of <hi>Diſlocations</hi> in general.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Diſlocation is a forcing of the Bone out of its cavity and natural place into another, hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voluntary motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, 1. From the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; for ſometimes the Bone is altogether forced out of its place, and that is properly called <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> or <hi>Diſlocation:</hi> Sometimes it is got out but a little or half, which is called Sub-laxation, or <hi>Elongation.</hi> 2. From the <hi>Cauſe</hi>; for ſometimes it is from an external accident, as by wreſtlings, Falls, or Blows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes from internal Cauſes, by the afflux of Humors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> are of two ſorts; 1. <hi>External,</hi> Such as are Falling, Beating, Running, Wreſtling, and vehement extention, as it often happens to Women in Labour, through the unskilfulneſs of Midwives; yea, by a violent ſtroke or fall, even the Bones of the Infant in the Womb, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located. 2. <hi>Internal,</hi> By the afflux of Humors, which falling into the Joints, relax and reſolve the Ligaments, and ſo cauſeth the Bones to ſlip out of their places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52336:19"/>The <hi>Signs,</hi> eſpecially in a lean Body, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enough. The Bone cauſeth in the place to <hi>which</hi> it is forced, a tumor or riſing; and in that <hi>whence</hi> it is forced, a cavity. If there be a perfect Diſlocation, the Member will be drawn up, and ſhorter (unleſs the luxation happen by the laxity of the Ligaments, than it becomes longer) the part is painful, chiefly upon motion. In a Subluxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe Accidents are leſſer, and ſeldom all together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] In Children and other tender Bodies, the Bones may be reduced more eaſily; but are kept in with more difficulty; the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happens in ſtrong and full grown perſons: The Diſlocation of the Head is mortal, that of the <hi>Vertebra</hi>'s dangerous; and that which is inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate is hard to be cured. That which proceeds from an inward Cauſe, is of a ſlower Cure, and does eaſily return.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] The Bone forced out, muſt be reduced to its place, either by the Hands, Ligatures, or Inſtruments; but by which of theſe three it ſhall be performed, the Nature of the affected part will declare. 'Tis certain, that theſe four Manual Operations (<hi>Extention, Setting, Binding</hi> and <hi>Well-placing</hi>) muſt <hi>here</hi> be uſed as well as in <hi>Fractures</hi> of Bones.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Extention</hi> muſt be made ſo great, that there may be a cavity between the Bone that remains well, and that which hath been forced away, to the end that in the ſetting, the one may not rub againſt the other; whence afterwards are wont to riſe very grievious, and ſometimes incurable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Setting,</hi> care muſt be had not to wreſt the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52336:19"/>
Bones nor the Muſcles, but to keep their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral figure. Before you proceed to <hi>binding</hi> up the Member, endeavour to preſerve the part from inflammation and flux of Humors, and ſtrengthen it with the following Medicines.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>A ſtrengthening Plaſter.</head>
                        <p>Take Frankincenſe, Maſtick, Bole-armonick, Dragons-Blood, of each half an ounce; fine-Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, an ounce; Roots of great Comfrey, two drams; Weather-Sewet, three ounces; white-Wax, as much as ſufficeth to make a Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>Another.</p>
                        <p>Take Litharge, Wax, Roſin, of each three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; being melted over the fire, add to them, of great Comfrey, Bean-Meal, Bole-armonick ſteep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Vinegar, and dried, of each three ounces; Tragacanth, two ounces. Make it into a Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>If the pain, or other ſymptoms do not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily require it, you ought not to looſen the Bandage before the fifth, ſixth, or ſeventh day, and then do it with as little motion as is poſſible. Laſtly, lay the Part <hi>even,</hi> and in ſuch a poſture, in which, when found, it can longeſt remain without trouble.</p>
                        <p>If you find the Diſlocation accompanied by an Inflammation, beware of extending the part, or doing ought to it before that be removed; which you are to do, firſt with emollient, and afterwards with diſcutient, Medicines.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Jaw-bone,</hi> except it be in young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, can hardly be diſlocated otherwiſe than forwards. Sometimes it is only diſlocated in one ſide, and is eaſily reſtored; ſometimes in both, in which caſe it is difficult to ſet, and very dangerous, and often mortal.</p>
                     <p>It is very ſeldom luxated from a debility of the Muſcles; ſometimes from the laxity of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the moſt part, from a too wide open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mouth. If it be diſlocated but on one ſide, it ſtands a-skew, and is turned towards the ſide hurt; ſome thing is prominent, the Teeth ſtand not directly under one another, nor can they be brought together, ſo that the Mouth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains open. You muſt draw it towards the op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſite ſide, and reduce it to its place, which is not hard to do; yea, by a ſtiff box on the Ear it hath often been reſtored.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52336:20"/>If it be diſlocated on both ſides, then does it fall forwards, the Mouth ſtands open, both the <hi>Apophyſes</hi> are prominent, the lower Teeth ſtand further than the upper, and the <hi>temporal</hi> Muſcles are diſtended. In this caſe, let yout Servant hold the Patient's Head firm, or hold it againſt a Wall; draw the Jaw-bone firſt downward, putting both your Thumbs in the Mouth, then backward, and laſtly upward.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Collar-bone</hi> rarely happens to be luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and is ſeldom ſet, but it ſtands ſomewhat out; whereby it often comes to paſs, that the Patient cannot lift up his hand to his mouth, much leſs to his head. For reſtoring it, you are to lay the Patient on his back, and a ſtone under his ſhoulder; then you muſt draw his Arm for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and backward, as the Diſlocation requires; then preſs the Clavicle, ſo raiſed, down into its place.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>Great Bone of the Arm (Adjutorium)</hi> is never diſlocated backward; ſeldom upwards and forwards, but for the moſt part downward: a certain ſign of it is, if you find it roundiſh hardneſs under the Arm-pits, and on the top of the Shoulder a hollowneſs, and the Arm be longer, and the Patient cannot bring his hand to his Mouth. It may be reduced ſeveral ways; but theſe are the moſt convenient, and the moſt ſure. 1. Let a ſtrong man hold the Patient faſt about the hurt Shoulder, and let another draw the Arm downwards; then lift the upper part of the Arm into its Cavity, and the Bone will be ſoon reſtored into its place. 2. Take a ſtrong Ladder, at the foot thereof put a <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

ſtep, bind ſomething round that may juſt fit the Arm-pits; put the Patients Arm upon it, and draw it downward, moving the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone to and fro; let your Servant, mean while, draw the ſound Arm downward, and withal, thruſt away the Stool from under the Patient, that whilſt he is thus pendulous, the Shoulder-bone may be reſtored. 3. Lay the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits of the Patient upon the Shoulder of a ſtrong and taller man than himſelf; draw the diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Arm downward, ſo that he lifting up his own Shoulder, the Patient may remain in a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous poſture: In the mean time, preſs his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der downward, working the Arm to and fro, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be reſtored to its due place. 4.

                     <p n="7">7. A <hi>Rib</hi> diſlocated, muſt not remain long out of its place, leſt more grievous Accidents follow. If it be removed out of its <hi>Vertebra</hi> upwards, then hang the Patient by his Arms over a Door, and ſo preſs it in. If it be out of joint downward, the Patient muſt bend himſelf, laying his hands upon his Knees, and the Chirurgeon in the mean time, muſt move to and again the diſplaced Rib till it be reſtored to its right place. If it be diſlocated inward, lay a ſticking Plaiſter on it, and often pull it away with violence; and thus ſometimes it may be reſtored; if not, it often proveth mortal, not being capable to be reduced by the Hands.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Cubitus</hi> may be diſlocated <hi>forward</hi> or <hi>backward, inward</hi> or <hi>outward.</hi> And ſometimes the <hi>Radius</hi> is likewiſe diſlocated with it, ſometimes it remains in its place; which by handling the part, is eaſily perceived. If the <hi>Cubitus</hi> be out <hi>forwards,</hi> the Arm thereby becomes ſhorter, &amp; cannot be bent; the Bone ſtands out forwards, and behind there is a preternatural hallowneſs. The forced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bone muſt, as well in this, as in all other kinds of diſlocation of the Elbow, be ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; otherwiſe there will follow grievous Pain, Inflammation, Feaver, Vomiting of Choler, and ſometimes Death it ſelf. Let the Arm be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obliquely, and ſo far, that one Bone may not hurt the other in the ſetting. If the Hands be not ſtrong enough, then bend the diſlocated Arm about a Pillar or a Bed-poſt, and by the help of a Bandage extend it, preſſing the Bone backward, until it be replaced. If it be diſlocated <hi>back-ward,</hi> the Arm will then alſo be ſhorter, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52336:22"/>
cannot be bent, the Bone will ſtand out behind; and before there is a preternatural cavity. If it be <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward,</hi> there are the like ſigns; only the Tumor will be in the place, to which the Bone hath been forced; whereas the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is there, whence it hath been forced. All theſe <hi>three</hi> diſlocations may be eaſily cured by a convenient Extention, if they be not invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The ſame is to be underſtood of the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> when forced out of its place.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Hip</hi> may be put out of joint four man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ways chiefly; <hi>inward, outward</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> but ſeldom <hi>backward.</hi> If <hi>inward,</hi> the Leg is longer, and moveth with difficulty; the Knee is turned outward, and the head of the Thigh-bone by the hands may be perceiv'd in the Groin. As it is difficult to put in, ſo eaſily doth it ſlip out again, whereby the Part affected is waſted, and the Patient lamed. To reduce it to its place, lay the Patient upon the midſt of a Bench or Table; between his Legs put a ſtrong ſtick, wound about with Linnen, and upon it let him ſtifly ſtretch out his Leg, and the Chirurgeon in the mean time with his hands ſet it. If outwardly diſlocated, the Leg grows ſhorter, and the Foot is turned inwards. The Patient can then indeed bend his Leg, but hardly bring it to the ground. Though it be not ſet aright, yet the pain vaniſheth of it ſelf, and the Patient in time is able to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Crutches. Lay him on a Bench or Table as above; let the Leg be ſtrongly extended, either with hands or Bandage, and mean while reduce it into its place. If the Hip be forced out <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> the Groin is ſwoln, and the Buttocks fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, the Leg is neither longer nor ſhorter, nor
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52336:22"/>
cannot be bent but with trouble; and the Urine is ſuppreſſed. Though it be not ſet aright, yet the Patient in time will be able to go well enough upon it; though ſometimes it falls out, that he muſt ſomewhat trail his Leg after him. To reſtore it, let the Patient lie on his ſound ſide, and ſtrongly ſtretch out his Leg, preſs it into its former place; and in caſe the hand be too weak, thruſt it in with your Knee. If it be diſlocated <hi>backward,</hi> the Patient can neither ſtretch out, nor bend his Leg, nor is he able to bring his Heel to the ground, and if he ſhould force himſelf to do ſo, he would fall backward; the Leg is ſhorter, there is a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowleſs in the Groins, and if the Buttocks be preſſed upwards, you ſhall find an unuſual ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Though it be not put in, yet the pain will in time vaniſh, and then the Leg may be bent again, but it remains ſhorter and ſtraight, nor is the Foot turned inward nor outward. Lay the Patient on his Belly, and ſtrongly extend his Leg; mean time apprehend the Thigh bone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Knee; ſtretch it outward from off the ſound Leg; preſs the Head into its Cavity, in which yet it will not ſtay, if thenceforth the Patient do not keep himſelf very quiet.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VII. Of Ruptures.</head>
                     <p>HAving thus roughly handled the boney and hard parts of the Body, it now follows, that I treat the ſoft and fleſhie more gently, and deſcribe their <hi>Syntheſis</hi> or re-unition again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin with the broken <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which ſometimes gives way to the Inteſtines, at other times to the Cawl, and not ſeldom to both, to get out of their natural place into the Groins or <hi>Scrotum,</hi> there cauſing a Rupture called <hi>Entorocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Inteſtinalis,</hi> if the Guts come out; an <hi>Epiplocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Omentalis,</hi> if the <hi>Omentum</hi> or Cawl be out.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is made up of two ſtrong, but ſoft Membranes, which do ſo contain whatſoever is included in the Belly or loweſt Cavity, that when ſound, nothing can fall out. In Women, the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> is its utmoſt Limit. In Men, its outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Membrane reaches farther; and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the firſt proper Coat of the Teſticles. In the Groins, it comprehends the Seminal Veſſels as in a Sheath, called <hi>Proceſſus,</hi> or <hi>Productio Peritonaei.</hi> This being ſtretch'd, or enlarged, or coming to burſt, is the proximate cauſe to the lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Ruptures. The Groins therefore are the uſual places of Ruptures: But do not imagine, that the <hi>Peritonoeum</hi> cannot be diſtended or burſt in other places, and there to cauſe a Rupture. It happens ſometimes above the Navel, yet ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: <hi>Beneath,</hi> and <hi>on the ſide</hi> of the Navel, far
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52336:23"/>
above the Groins, I have not only ſeen it often, with many others, but ſeen it ordered and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed juſt like an Abſceſs; the Chirurgeon giving no other reaſon for his miſtake, than that it was not the place of Ruptures; which thoſe that love the Art and their own Honour, may take notice of.</p>
                     <p>Moſt times the <hi>Ileon</hi> falls down, yet ſometimes the other Guts come out with it, and fall into the <hi>Scrotum</hi>; which cannot come to paſs by a ſimple diſtention of the aboveſaid <hi>proceſs,</hi> but that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in all ſuch great Ruptures it muſt be broken.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> which make the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> to burſt or to dilate, are Falling, Leaping, Blows, bearing of heavy Burdens, ſtrong Vomiting or Coughing, difficult going to Stool, Winds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and all vehement Motions of the Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] The Tumor is ſometimes bigger, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſer, ſometimes altogether vaniſht, but with the leaſt Motion returning. Though the Caul or Inteſtines ſhould be fallen down never ſo much, they may eaſily, without any pain, be thruſt in again, unleſs Wind or Excrement hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, in which caſe the Rupture is very painful.</p>
                     <p>If the Inteſtines be full of Wind, the whole bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is tenſe; you may hear a noiſe, and the Patient breaks Wind upwards and downwards. If the Excrements be grown hard, the Patient goes with difficulty to Stool, and the ſwelling, weight and hardneſs, little by little encreaſeth. If the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> be only relaxed and widened, then the Tumor from little becomes bigger by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; but if it be broken, it ſuddenly deſcends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] In little Children, Ruptures are eaſily cured; in aged people, ſlowly or not at all, eſpecially if the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> be burſt. If
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52336:24"/>
the Inteſtines be filled with Wind or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there follows pain; and if that be not ſuddenly removed, an Inflamation, Gangrene, and at laſt Death it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] Lay the Patient on his Back with his Legs on high, and a little aſunder, by which it often comes to paſs, that the Caul or the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines return of themſelves into their former place; but that not happening, preſs them in gently with your fingers. And if you cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this, by reaſon of Wind or hardened Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, then uſe the following Medicines.</p>

                        <p>Take Mummy, one dram; Galbanum diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Vinegar, two drams; Myrrhe, Filings of Steel, dried Hares-Dung, of each half a dram; Powder of Earth-Worms, two ſcruples: Make them into Pils about the bigneſs of a great Peaſe.</p>
                        <p>If by a Wound, the Caul or Inteſtines come out, you are to endeavour to put them in again, before they loſe their natural warmth or colour by the Air, otherwiſe there will remain but ſmall hopes of recovery.</p>
                        <p>If the Inteſtines be wounded, then with a wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Thread ſtitch the Lips together, and with a gentle hand return it into the Body; as alſo the <hi>Omentum</hi> ſlipt out, unleſs it ſhould have loſt its natural colour and warmth; in which caſe, you muſt tie it in the place where it is ſound, cutting off the part that is putrid, and reduce it into the Belly, leaving the Thread hanging out of the Wound, that after Suppuration, it may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently fetcht out.</p>
                        <p>And then you muſt ſtitch together the Wound of the Belly and the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which is to be done after this manner; Take a Needle, thred it with a Waxen Thread, thruſt it from without through the Skin and Muſcles unto the very <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi>; leaving it on this ſide untoucht, but lay hold on it on the other ſide; pierce it through, and the Muſcles and the Skin alſo, drawing the Lips together; then paſſing over the ſpace of an inch, thruſt in the Needle on the ſame ſide again, on which you drew it out laſt, through the Skin
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52336:26"/>
and Muſcles, leaving again the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> on the ſame ſide untoucht, but holding it on the other ſide, thruſt it through together with the Skin and Muſcles, and ſo on: Then ſeeing that by reaſon of the continual motion of the Belly, your ſtitches may be eaſily undone, the rather, becauſe the haſte, ſometimes here to be uſed, will not permit to make them with Exactneſs, it is always neceſſary to apply to the Wound a ſticking-Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>Among theſe Ruptures is to be reckoned the <hi>Navel-Rupture</hi> (called <hi>Exomphalos,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicalis</hi>) which proceeds from the ſame cauſe, and is cured by the ſame means: Only you are here to obſerve, That upon the Plaiſter, you muſt put Bolſters of Leather, or other hard things, and this according to the bigneſs of the Rupture; that by this means it may be ſufficiently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly kept in.</p>
                        <p>It is worthy nothing that the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom burſts in this part. I have divers times found and ſhewed in diſſected Bodies, that the Navil, together with the Inteſtine following, ſtood out bigger than a mans Head, inſomuch that the right Muſcles of the Belly were preſſed to the ſide, and ſevered from one another; and yet was the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> but ſtretched, and no where broken.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſe</hi> are the ſimple and compounded Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are commonly deſcribed; but <hi>Practice</hi> ſhews us many others, not mention'd by Writers. For, <hi>Experience</hi> hath taught me, that the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> may burſt in the back-part, and there cauſe a Rupture. We alſo find, that the <hi>Proceſſus Peritonaei</hi> near to the Groins, may come
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52336:26"/>
ſo to be lacerated, that the Guts preſs not into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> but between the Skin and Muſcles falls down toward the Thigh. Beſides, we have more than once found, that the <hi>Vás deferens</hi> was <hi>fallen</hi> twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and had there made a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which happening, it may with the Hands be eaſily reduced, yet, goes in of it ſelf by lying backward, without any further inconvenience.</p>
                        <p>The manner of cure had nothing peculiar in it ſelf, but that you contrive ſuch Bands, that may reduce the parts fallen out into their right place, without prejudicing the ſound ones.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Matrix</hi> does not eaſily fall down by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation, much leſs by Laceration of her broad Ligaments, as moſt Writers imagin; from hard Labour, or by an indiſcreet drawing away of the <hi>Secundine.</hi> Others with me have ſeen, that the bottom of the <hi>Matrix</hi> hath been plainly inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>pudendis,</hi> ſo that the inward part ſhewed it ſelf as the outward. We have alſo found (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe that were ſubject to Coſtiveneſs or Belly-ach) that the membranes of the <hi>Puden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> were ſo far ſtretcht out, that the unskilful have taken it for the <hi>Matrix</hi> it ſelf, and do ſo ſtill.

                     <p>To cure this Diſeaſe, lay the Patient on her back, with her Knees on high, and Legs aſunder; then take a Wax-Candle of a competent thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mix therewith ſome <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> or <hi>Aſſa Foeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and with it gently preſs the Womb inward, and having ſaſtened the Candle with a Bandage,

apply outwardly to the Belly the <hi>Emplaſtrum Barbarum,</hi> or the following:</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of Cyprus, Biſtort, of each a dram; Galls, Acacia, of each half a dram: Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs-Nuts, Date-ſtones, Myrtle-Berries, of each one dram; Pitch and Colophony, as much as ſufficeth to make it into a Plaiſter.</p>

                     <p>Here great care is to be had, that your Wax-Candle be not too thick, to the end that by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual friction it may not cauſe <hi>Fluorem Album,</hi> whereby the ſtrength of the Body would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to decay.

                     <head>CHAP. XI. Of opening a Vein.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>BLeeding</hi> (one of the greateſt Remedies in the Art of Phyſick) is ſometimes highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but ſometimes ſo dangerous, that it ought not to be uſed without very urgent Cauſes. Here therefore I think it will be better ſomewhat to digreſs for fuller information, than to leave the unskilful in their error.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Blood</hi> is the darling of Nature, by whoſe aſſiſtance ſhe performeth all her Operations, and which can hardly be drawn from her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dammage; yet does Art require, that thoſe who meddle with it, being neither venturous nor timorous, but diſcreet and couragious, and making out of neceſſity a virtue, do ſometimes proceed to the opening a Vein; yet for no other than theſe <hi>four</hi> following cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In a <hi>Plethora,</hi> or ſuper-abundance of blood, that by this means Nature may be eaſed of her too heavy burden, and the innate heat preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſuffocation.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52336:29"/>2. For <hi>Revulſion-ſake,</hi> when the blood and the (therein) mingled humors, by flowing too plentifully to this or that part, hinder the Cure: Here you are always to chuſe a Vein of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide, and that ſometimes the fartheſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſometimes the neareſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Derivation</hi> or conveyance of the Blood (which is already got into the part, but is not yet altogether ſetled there, nor extravaſated) into another place; in which caſe a Vein is to be opened the neareſt to the Part.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For <hi>Refrigeration,</hi> when the heat of the Blood is ſo exceſſive, that it cannot be allayed by cooling Medicines, or not time enough.</p>
                     <p>Theſe limits are too narrow for ſome, who will needs take into thoſe a <hi>fifth</hi> cauſe, which they make the <hi>Corruption</hi> of the Blood, held by them to be as great an inducement for bleeding as any of the <hi>four</hi> by us recited; to the end, <hi>ſay they,</hi> that Nature being rid of part of what is corrupt, may be the better able to correct what remains.</p>
                     <p>But I much wiſh, 1. That they could make this diſcharge without the loſs of that ſtrength which is ſo highly neceſſary. 2. That they would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when their Patient is to bleed, and preciſely tell to what degree of <hi>corruption</hi> his blood is come, that ſo the Chirurgeon may know how much of it he is to take, and how often; foraſmuch as they will not allow, that Bleeding is good in all ſorts of the Blood's corruption, but in that only which is not gone conſiderably far. 3. That they would declare, why they will have cur'd the greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by Purging, and the leſſer by Bleeding, ſince that they give to the one as well as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (and that duly) the name of <hi>Cacho-Chimia.</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52336:29"/>
Let them ſhew, that things differing only <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Majus &amp; Minus,</hi> do differ in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and ſo require ſpecifically different Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Others proceed yet further, and ſhed innocent Blood in all ſorts of Fevers, without any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſpots of the Plague, or of Poiſon it ſelf; thus freeing themſelves from a great deal of labor and trouble, otherwiſe caus'd to the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> from the variety of Fevers. But becauſe the nature of all Poyſon and Malignant Humors is continually to aſſault the Heart, and ſuddenly to proſtrate the ſtrength of the ſtrongeſt Perſons; and ſince Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth likewiſe <hi>both,</hi> not only diminiſhing ſtrength, but alſo drawing the malignity toward the Heart, and driving in again, for the oppreſſion of Nature, what ſhe had thrown out for her relief: I do intreat and warn all the Practiſers of our Art, That as they love the quiet of their Mind, and the good of their Patients, they would beware of bleeding in Peſtilential and other Malignant Fevers; as alſo in all caſes that may befal People by Poyſon, either inward or outward.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French, Italians, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugueſes</hi> (great Blood-letters) will, I expect, tell me; That Nature, when by bleeding ſhe hath vent, and is ſomewhat diſcharg'd, ſhall be better able to throw out the remaining Evil. And this ſeems to be true, for the blood indeed receives Air, that the Spirits may the better flie away, and is robb'd of that ſtrength which it ſo neceſſarily wants; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nature exchangeth the Life of the Patient for death, and extorts tears from the By-ſtanders.</p>
                     <p>Without alledging other Reaſons, they ground themſelves upon Experience. And it were to be wiſhed they had that ground indeed; for we find
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52336:30"/>
ſuch Patients of theirs, who in the morning were in no danger, even after but the taking away of five or ſix ounces of Blood, to be cold and ſtiff at night. Whence it may eaſily be collected, what it is they call <hi>Experience, viz.</hi> If the Patient by chance eſcape death, then <hi>Bleeding</hi> muſt have the honor of it; but if he die, as for the moſt part, then the malignity of the Diſeaſe was the cauſe of it. Wherefore I alledge Experience againſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and praiſe God Almighty, that he hath vouchſafed to furniſh all thoſe, who without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, paſſion, or ſlaviſh dependance upon others, will duly conſider Diſeaſes with ſurer means.</p>
                     <p>The more moderate ſort of them would have <hi>Bleeding</hi> only adminiſtred in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, and before the Malignity appears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. This I ſhall willingly allow them; 1. In very hot Countreys. 2. In a Plethorick Body. 3. If the humors flying to the head, cauſe any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſymptoms there; in which caſe, bleeding in the Hand or Foot may be, I think, very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. Otherwiſe thoſe that uſe it in all bodies, and without diſtinction in theſe cold and moiſt parts, will find the ill effects of it, and be puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led withal to give a reaſon for their Practice, allowable by Art; the rather becauſe, by their own confeſſion, they dare not uſe this their Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Bleeding at certain times, but find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beſt in the uſe of Sudorificks and cooling Drinks. But enough of this.</p>
                     <p>Now how <hi>many Ounces</hi> of Blood ought to be taken at once; the degree of the Diſeaſe, and the Patients more or leſs ſtrength, will indicate. And 'tis better too little than too much. I have never taken more from the ſtrongeſt and moſt plethoric
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52336:30"/>
Perſon under my Cure, than twelve ounces at once, chuſing rather, in caſe of need, to let out twenty ounces at two times, than fifteen at once; of which method I have found good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of the <hi>year,</hi> and the <hi>hour</hi> of the <hi>day,</hi> little regard needs to be had in thoſe Diſeaſes, wherein bleeding cannot be deferred without danger, as in Pluriſies, Squinancies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Otherwiſe, the Spring and Autumn, and the Morning are beſt.</p>
                     <p>The veins that are wont commonly to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are theſe: In the Forehead, the <hi>Vena frontis</hi>; in the Temples, the <hi>Vena Temporalis</hi>; in the Mouth, the <hi>Vena ſublingualis,</hi> or <hi>Ranularis</hi>; in the Neck, the <hi>Jugularis externa</hi>; in the Arm, the <hi>Baſilica,</hi> under which lieth an Artery; the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi> under which lieth a Nerve, and under both of them a Tendon; and the <hi>Cephalica,</hi> which hath under, or near it, neither Artery, Nerve, nor Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and therefore may ſafely be opened: This laſt hath but one ſmall Branch that runs outward to the head, whence it hath got the name of the <hi>Head Vein.</hi> Without this conſideration, it little matters which of theſe three be opened, in regard that about the Arm-pits they all acknowledge no more but one Branch. In the Hand, between the little finger and its neighbour, the <hi>Salvatella</hi>; in the Foot, the <hi>Saphena</hi> and <hi>Iſchiatica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>manner</hi> of Bleeding is ſo well known, that I think it needleſs here to deſcribe it; only I could wiſh, that ſome of thoſe that let blood, would take care ſomewhat better to gueſs of the number of Ounces of Blood they take from their Patients, that ſo we might not find 12, 16, 18, yea, 22 ounces drawn away inſtead of 6 or 8, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52336:31"/>
were preſcribed. To prevent ſo intolerable a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, I would adviſe, that ſmall Porringers of Tin or Copper were made, in which the number of ounces were mark'd; though expert Maſters do not at all need them, as knowing that Blood is really weightier, than it outwardly ſeems.</p>

When it may affect a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler part. 3. When it lieth in the Joynts. 4. When it is caſt out by a <hi>Criſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before you proceed to the opening, you are to conſider, whether the matter be contain'd <hi>in its own proper Tunicle,</hi> or whether it be without any <hi>Tunicle.</hi> If <hi>without</hi> any, then make your aperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a right Line, obſerving the Fibres of the Muſcles. <hi>For Example</hi>; In the head, according to the poſition of the Hair, long-ways; in the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, tranſverſe; in the Temples, the Noſe, Neck, Breaſt, Back, Arms, Feet, Joynts, long-ways;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52336:31"/>
in the midſt of the Abdomen, let it be long-ways; in the ſides of it ſomewhat oblique; in the Groins, tranſverſe; but not very deep, by ſeaſon of the ſubjacent ſeminary Veſſels. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beware of touching any great Vein, Artery or Nerve, though the Fibres be cut a-croſs, leſt from a leſſer evil there ſhould ariſe a greater.</p>
                     <p>The propereſt place for the opening, is the moſt raiſed and ſofteſt part of the Abſceſs, if poſſible in the depending, that the purulent matter may the more conveniently be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: To which end alſo you are with a Tent ſo long to keep open the wound, until the part, being altogether cleanſed of its preternatural Humors, may return to its former Functions.</p>
                     <p>In the opening, thruſt not in the Launcet too deep, nor further into the Cavity than to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as ſoon as you perceive <hi>that,</hi> draw it a little back, and turn the point upward; making your opening through the Skin ſo big as may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the contained matter a free vent.</p>
                     <p>If the Abſceſs be included in a Tunicle, if ſmall, make the Inciſion long ways; if big, then make a double inciſion, that is, croſs-ways; and beware of touching the Veſicle, otherwiſe you muſt expect a foetide and almoſt incurable Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This being well done, preſs out with your Fingers the Veſicle, which ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſticks to the Skin, and eaſily follows; cut off the little Artery by which it is fed; and have a care, that not the leaſt Particle of the Bag may remain on it, leſt it gather again.</p>
                     <p>Foraſmuch as in this Operation I find, that Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons differ in the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> they ought to uſe, ſome chuſing the <hi>Launcet,</hi> others the <hi>Potential Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52336:32"/>
and extol it far above the former: I think my ſelf obliged to declare here what I judge of this matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Potential Cautery</hi> hath this Advantage, that it doth not terrifie timorous Patients, nor is painful to the tender; eſpecially joyning with it the preſent and known good Remedies: For <hi>unquenched Lime,</hi> mixed with <hi>Holland Sope,</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deep enough into the fleſh, yet much gentli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Corroſive of <hi>Ambr. Paraeus.</hi> But it hath theſe Inconveniencies:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That according to the tenderneſs or ſtrength of the Skin or Bodies, ſometimes it eats in deeper than needs; for we have found by experience, that in ſome it hath eaten through the Skin and Muſcles, to the very cavity of the Belly; in others irrecoverably wounded the proceſſes of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> together with the ſeminal veſſels therein.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Commonly it ſpreads it ſelf in length and breadth ſomewhat further than you would have it, eſpecially if it be to be applied under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, in the Groin, or in the Joynts; for it no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grows warm, but it melts, and ſo ſpreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, notwithſtanding the Plaiſter with which the Surgeon deſigned to bound it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are neceſſarily required ſome hours (in ſome Bodies more, in others leſs) before it can perform its Operation; and this the Humor will not always bear, eſpecially if it be malign.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And the Scar falls not preſently off; and if you would give a preſent vent to the Humors, you will be obliged ſtill to make uſe of a Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. Be as circumſpect as you can, I am ſure, you will hardly avoid theſe Inconveniencies.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Launcet</hi> hath this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52336:32"/>
that many people are affrighted at it, and that it is painful: But the fear may be prevented by ſilence, and the pain is little conſiderable; mean time you have theſe Advantages:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That with the <hi>Launcet,</hi> the Apertion may be made as long and as deep as the Chirurgeon deſireth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The matter is ſuddenly diſcharged, and the Patient hath preſent relief.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The unconcocted remainder may be the ſooner concocted, by aſſiſting Nature with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Remedies, both inwardly and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. You will not be troubled with a long gleet, which if it happens, the fault is aſſuredly in the Chirurgeon. For almoſt all Tumors that appear behind the Ears, in the Neck, under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, or in the Groin, ſpring from indurated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, replete with a preternatural humor; theſe Glandules are all included in their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, which being toucht, either with a Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, or with Corroſive Medicines, there muſt needs follow a gleet (for 'tis impoſſible that the Glandule ſhould be able to preſerve it ſelf, or the contained Humor, its Tunicle being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) which will continue until the whole Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule and Tunicle are both conſumed.</p>

                     <p>WIthin the <hi>Ear</hi> is a thin, but ſtrong <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> called the <hi>Drum.</hi> This being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergrown with another preternatural Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, or a Caruncle, the Patient loſeth his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; which is not at all to be cured by any Manual Art, and difficultly by Medicines. But if the Cavity of the Ear come to be cloſed up with a Membrane, and thereby the hearing loſt, then is it to be opened with a fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as ſoon as may be, cicatriz'd.</p>
                     <p>That many have been born with the <hi>Anus</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perforated, and the Inteſtine covered with a Membrane, hath been often obſerved; which if the Membrane be tender and thin, is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with the Fingers; if thick, with a Launcet, long-ways; and afterwards kept open with a ſmall leaden Pipe, and drying Medicines.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pudenda Virginum</hi> are ſometimes alſo clos'd with a preternatural Membrane, which cauſeth moſt grievous Accidents, when they are grown marriageable. Sometimes the part is altogether grown together; ſometimes upon an ill-treated <hi>Ulcer, coaleſcunt Labia &amp; Membrum illud ineptum reddunt congreſſui virili.</hi> Sometimes a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Caruncle ſhuts the <hi>Os Vulvae.</hi> The two firſt are to be opened long ways with a ſharp In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, in part wound about with linnen Rags,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52336:33"/>
and then cured according to Art. To the laſt, which cauſeth moſt difficulty, you'l need in the Operation a <hi>Speculum Matricis,</hi> and in the latter end of the Cure, a ſmall Pipe, perforated through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in length, to promote the Cicatrizing.</p>
                     <p>Here we ſhall take leave to ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> not of a long and ſharp one, for which I have found either none, or at leaſt, no better remedy than contempts, patience and commiſeration; but of thoſe, that being ſhort and tied, deprive Children, firſt, of Sucking, afterwards of Speaking: Which is eaſily remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by looſening the ſtring of the Tongue, by cutting it tranſverſe with a pair of Sciſſars, and anointing it afterwards with Honey of Roſes three or four times a day. In the cutting, the neighboring parts and veins muſt be carefully ſhunned; and ſometimes the Nerve of the ſixth pair of its Branches run ſo near the String, that by a deep inciſion they may be eaſily hurt, and the Patient fall into ſad Accidents. Here let the Chirurgeon know, that of an hundred Children, ſcarce one needs this Manual Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and that thoſe Midwives are as raſh as ignorant, who in all new-born Babes, do forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with dilacerate this String, whereby the found parts being hurt, they are often deprived of their neceſſary Sucking, and, by ſubſequent ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, of their Life.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ALthough the word <hi>Paracentheſis,</hi> ſignifies all Punctures, yet cuſtom hath appropriated it ſolely to the opening of the Belly in a <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> and to that of the Breaſt in <hi>Empyema,</hi> though more to <hi>that</hi> than to <hi>this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Manual Operation is ancient, and full of danger; yet ſometimes preſerves the life of the Patient. Nature and Succeſs have emboldened us now and then to make uſe of it; but Experience hath taught us, that the greateſt difficulty conſiſts herein: 1. That the parts debilitated, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their natural heat, do eaſily, after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mortifie. 2. That together with the Water, iſſues out likewiſe the Spirits. 3. That the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing water can hardly be ſo kept in, but it will run out in deſpight of the Chirurgeon; and if, the better to cloſe the Wound, you do forcibly preſs in the Pipe, a Gangrene ſoon and eaſily enſueth.</p>
                     <p>Who therefore expects a good iſſue of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, muſt uſe it only upon a Body that is not emaciated or waſted; in a Dropſie that is recent (or at leaſt, when the Tumor in a ſhort time hath riſen to a great bulk) and which, upon the uſe of proper Remedies, would not preſently be removed; in ſuch Patients that are not moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Fever, or with difficulty of breathing, and where the noble parts are yet ſound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted; and in perſons of a middle age, ſince in Children and in old people it ſucceeds not ſo proſperouſly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52336:34"/>As to the <hi>Place</hi>; if the Navel ſtands out, ſeek for no other, but make your opening therein: But if that be much drawn in (as it commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be in Hydropical Perſons) it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it: In which caſe you muſt take for your place three inches beneath the Navel, not in the white-Line, which, to my wonder, I find propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome; but, on the ſide of the <hi>right Muſcle,</hi> in the Muſcle called <hi>Oblique Deſcendens</hi>: Mark it firſt with Ink, and then make a ſmall Apertion through the Skin, Muſcles, and <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great care that the <hi>Omentum,</hi> or Guts, be not wounded; which alſo, by reaſon of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Water, cannot eaſily be hurt. He that will be very careful of the opening, muſt make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Ductus</hi> of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely downwards (according to this \) in the left ſide; and (according to this, /) in the right ſide.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as you perceive Water to come forth, take a Golden, Silver, or Leaden ſmall Pipe, that is, 1. Smooth. 2. Furniſht at the Head with a Button or Wing. 3. Perforated on the ſides with three or four holes. 4. No longer than the thickneſs of the diſſected part, that is, an inch broad. 5. Somewhat crooked at the end. 6. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fitting the ſize of the Orifice. Put this into the Apertion, lay over it a ſticking-Plaiſter (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take a Spunge, or a four double linnen Rag) bind up the Patient, and let him reſt two or three hours; then open the Bandage again, and take away one, two, three, ſeldom or never more pints of Water, and ſo repeating it once or twice a day, till the water be <hi>almoſt</hi> all diſcharged. You muſt not take away all at firſt, for the chilneſs of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52336:35"/>
the parts, following ſo great an Evacuation, very often cauſeth death. The Pipe is not to be taken out, but muſt remain all the time of the cure in the Wound, which you muſt at length heal up according to Art.</p>
                     <p>For the opening of an Hydropical Belly, this is the ſafeſt as hitherto practiſed way, that is left us by the Ancients; but the induſtry of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity hath invented for us a much convenienter Inſtrument, whereby we not only do avoid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the above-mentioned difficulties, but alſo with leſs trouble preſerve the lives otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Patients, freeing them from ſtretching, pain and trouble, according to our pleaſure, or the degree of their ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>This never enough commended <hi>Inſtrument</hi> was firſt of all brought out of <hi>Italy</hi>; by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Chirurgeon of this City, Mr. <hi>Jacob Block,</hi> and by him put into practice, to the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of many Patients.</p>
                     <p>Commonly he chuſeth the place lately pointed out by us, <hi>viz.</hi> about three inches below the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and perforates the Skin, Muſcles and <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> unto the very Water, taking away no more at once than a quart.</p>
                     <p>That done, he draws out his Inſtrument again, puts nothing upon the made hole but dry Lint and a ſticking-Plaiſter, whereby he ſufficiently hinders the running out, againſt your Will, of even a drop of Water; for, upon the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Inſtrument, the opened Skin, Muſcles and <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> are eaſily by their natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo far drawn aſunder, that the holes cannot any more exactly cloſe upon one another.</p>
                     <p>This being once performed, we regulate our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52336:35"/>
according to the ſtrength of the Patient, ſtaying two, three or more days, before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this Operation; then either the firſt Orifice is to be opened, or again a new one to be made, eſpecially if the Chirurgeon finds, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be more conveniently drawn away in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place.</p>
                     <p>In an <hi>Hydrocele</hi> (when the water is fallen into the <hi>Scrotum</hi>) the ſaid Chirurgeon doth by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument ſo dexterouſly diſcharge the Water out of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> that the next day you ſhall not, or hardly be able to find where the Hole was.</p>
                     <p>The Perforation ſeems to me a little inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, wherefore I have cauſed this Inſtrument ſo far to be altered, as that I make the end not to be wrought round, but ſharp on both ſides, Launcet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by which means it may be ſooner thruſt through the Muſcles. But then, <hi>his</hi> may be made of Silver, <hi>mine</hi> muſt be of Steel.</p>
                     <p>To the end that you may the better compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what we ſay, we ſhall repreſent to your view the Inſtrument, and the Operation it ſelf, in the enſuing <hi>Figures.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XV. Of the Opening of the Breaſt.</head>
                     <p>THere is ſometimes collected in the Cavity of the Breaſt a <hi>water</hi> or <hi>purulent matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Water</hi> gathers either by ſome <hi>Lymphatick Veſſels</hi> burſt, or from an unconcocted watrineſs of the Blood. The <hi>purulent Matter</hi> follows upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the Throat, or Lungs, or a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be Matter that is collected, it is called <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema</hi>; if Water, <hi>Hydrops pectoris vel pulmonis,</hi> the Dropſie of the Breaſt or Lungs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Marks</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> are, a dry Cough, a painful heavineſs, a difficulty of breathing, even to Suffocation, great Thirſt, little Appetite, a pale Look and ſometimes a ſwelling of the Legs, now and then accompanied with a Feaver; and when the Patient turns himſelf, you may perceive a rumbling noiſe.</p>
                     <p>The collected <hi>Sanies</hi> may be known by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Signs</hi>; When the Inflamation of the Lungs or <hi>Pleura,</hi> will not, upon Bleeding, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient means, be ſufficiently removed, then may you apprehend a collection of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to come within a fortnight. Between the thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and fortieth day the Tumor commonly breaks. The Patient ſhall find a great heavineſs in his Cheſt without conſiderable pain; and in caſe it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pain, then you are to Expect a new Flux, which you muſt divert by Bleeding. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52336:37"/>
Patient hath a difficulty in breathing; in motion, he hears a rumbling, at leaſt he is ſenſible that the matter changeth place, and the ſide affected is to the touch, hotter than the other. He caſts up, with violent coughing, a purulent matter, having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fever; he finds an anxiety at his heart, and hath little ſtomach to his meat.</p>
                     <p>If we cannot expel theſe Humors by Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, nor by Diureticks, nor Diaphoreticks, nor by purging Medicines, then are we forc'd to come to Manual Operation.</p>
                     <p>This cannot be done without danger, and is not to be attempted in caſe the Patient be weak, and the inward parts already corrupted. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this Operation hath leſs danger than the next foregoing, and people oftner recover upon it; yea, Learned Writers aſſure us, that by this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and the uſe of Injection, they have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many of Ulcers of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>Place</hi> of Opening, Authors are not agreed in it; the reaſon whereof is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> runs higher in ſome perſons than in others; whence it comes to paſs, that the collected Humors in ſome Patients, lie higher than in others. Secondly, the Cheſt is raiſed in ſome, flat in others; which here much alters the caſe. Beſides, the Lungs do often grow ſo faſt to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> that the ſanious matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be carried into the Cavity of the Breaſt: In which caſe it would be ill done, to choſe the place of Opening loweſt, in reſpect of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.</hi> And in regard that in this, as in other ſwellings, the moſt eminent place is, eſteemed the moſt convenient for opening, it cannot be otherwiſe but that one Chirurgeon hath made
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52336:38"/>
choice of this place, and another uſeth that place as the beſt. Upon which account, <hi>Hyppocrates Guido, Amatus Luſitanus,</hi> &amp;c. do make the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the third and fourth Rib, counting from beneath upwards: <hi>Fienus, Riverius,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, between the fourth and fifth; <hi>Paulus Aegineta, Vidus Vidius, Fabritius ab Aquapendente, Sennertus,</hi> &amp;c. between the fifth and ſixth; which place, in my opinion, is the ſafeſt; for, if higher, the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> if lower, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> may be wounded, of which there have been many ſad Examples. But in this difference of diſſenting Writers, what hath been ſaid, will direct you to paſs into the ſafeſt Haven.</p>
                     <p>All things therefore well conſidered, chuſe the place where to make your Apertion; not the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part (for, <hi>before,</hi> the <hi>Sternum</hi> or Breaſt-bone will hinder your operation here; nor in the back-part, for the Ribs are ſo cloſe to one another, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting ſome Veſſels, you cannot make any Apertion there) but on the ſide, four or five inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from the <hi>Sternum</hi>: Neither ought the Inciſion to be ſo near to the upper Ribs, as to the lower, becauſe the intercoſtal Veſſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vein, Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Nerve, lie in the lower part of each Rib, where Nature hath aſſigned them a place, branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into the middle of the intercoſtal Muſcles; which diſſemination nevertheleſs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that the Inciſion may be made in the middle between the two Ribs.</p>
                     <p>After you have marked the place with Ink, charge the Patient to breath forth as long as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he can, without taking it in, and in the mean time make an oblique, but ſmall Orifice, and put into it a Silver or Leaden Pipe, and take forth four
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52336:38"/>
or five ounces of Matter to run out in a day. In caſe the Matter does not come forth well, place your Patient on the wounded ſide, and make him to cough; if by reaſon of its toughneſs it will not yet come forth, then inject into the cavity ſome abſterſive, exſiccating and healing Medicines; As,</p>
                     <p>Take Goats whey, eighteen ounces; Honey of Roſes, four ounces; the Juice of Celandine and Smallage, of each ſix drams: Mingle it.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of Comfrey the greater, an ounce; of Sanicle, half an ounce; the Leaves of Betony, Agrimony, Periwincle, Burnet, of each half a handful; the Cordial Flowers, two pugils; the Seed of St. John'swort, Holy-Thiſtle, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Nettle, of each half a dram: Boil them in Water and Honey to a pint and half; ſtrain it, and keep it for your uſe.</p>
                     <p>Of this Injection, the Patient may alſo drink a little twice or thrice a day.</p>
                     <p>It is yet further to be obſerved, that the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Matter is often contained in a Membrane of its own, and by its riſing, manifeſts it ſelf from without; and then the <hi>Latines</hi> call it <hi>Vomica Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis</hi>: In which caſe, you muſt not ſtay till the Membrane breaks of its ſelf; for by delay, the Matter flowing up and down is more difficulty to be got out of the Breaſt; but open it preſently, taking no other place, but the moſt raiſed part of the ſwelling.</p>
                     <p>Now, ſince an <hi>Empyema</hi> for the moſt part fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> and 'tis dayly found, that ignorant Chirurgeons take all kind of pain in the Sides, Belly and Breaſt, although cauſed from Winds only, for a Pleuriſie; thereupon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52336:39"/>
opening a Vein; I thought therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to write in this place of the <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> as much as is neceſſary for a Chirurgeon to know, for the preventing ſuch miſtakes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Pleuriſie then is an inflammation of the</hi> Pleura, <hi>and commonly of the Lungs themſelves, cauſed from afflux of Blood, accompanied with Pain Cough, ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood, ſhortneſs of Breath, continual Feaver, ſtrong and quick Pulſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is the Blood, ſometimes alone (when a true Pleuriſie) ſometimes mixt with other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors then it occaſions a <hi>Baſtard</hi> one.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs,</hi> as may be ſeen in the Deſcription, are ſo evident, that thoſe who know not how to diſtinguiſh it from a <hi>Cholick,</hi> are not worthy of any excuſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] The ſooner the matter is concocted, and the whiter and eaſier 'tis ejected, the quicker and ſafer is the Iſſue. If the Cough, and difficulty of breathing leſſen not by a copious Expectoration, 'tis an ill ſign. If the Patient come not to ſpit the third or fourth day, then will he ſcarce ſee the ſeventh. If upon Bleeding, and other fit means, the pain ceaſe not, the Patient muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, or the Pleuriſie will turn to a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an <hi>Empyema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] In this caſe, <hi>Bleeding</hi> is one of the moſt neceſſary and ſafeſt means of Cure; and if uſed in time, the Patient, in the very Operation, and before the Vein be cloſed, will find relief, and ſometimes be altogether freed of the pain. Nor do I know any Diſeaſe, in which there may, to the Patient's benefit, be ſo much Blood taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at once, as in this.</p>
                     <p>There are different Opinions concerning what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52336:39"/>
ſide the Patient is to bleed on: But thoſe have had little Experience of this ſickneſs, who have not found, that Patients (at leaſt in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys) are relieved much more and ſooner, when they are bled in the Arm of the ſame ſide where the Pain is, than when it is done in the oppoſite ſide.</p>
                     <p>The Pain not ceaſing in four and twenty hours, we are neceſſitated to bleed twice or thrice, moſt commonly in the ſame Arm; but here you muſt well obſerve the Patient's ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>After letting Blood, ſometimes Purging, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Expectorating Remedies, are very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. One only Medicine I cannot conceal from you, becauſe of its Excellency. The Induſtrious Phyſitian Dr. <hi>Hadden</hi> in his <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> hath much commended it, and I have, after once Bleeding, always in the beginning uſed it with great ſucceſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take the Juice of Dandelion, an ounce and half; the Water of Plantane, two ounces; of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Thiſtle and Scabious, Syrup of Poppies Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, of each an ounce; Crabs-Eyes, a ſcruple and half: Mix it.</p>
                     <p>Let the Patient every half hour take down a ſpoonful or two of it, until the Flux be ſtopped: After which you are to uſe other Remedies.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVI. Of Removing a Cataract of the Eye.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Cataract</hi> (by the Greeks called <hi>Hypochyma</hi> by the Latines, <hi>Suffuſio</hi>; in the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Tongue, <hi>De Staer) is a concretion of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humors, by little and little generating a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Membrane betwixt the</hi> Cornea <hi>and the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline Humor, covering either totally, or in part, the Pupil of the Eye, and ſo depriving the Patient, of his ſight, or hindring it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Difference.</hi>] It is either <hi>Imperfect,</hi> when the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is thin, or the Apple of the Eye not totally covered; or <hi>Perfect,</hi> when it is changed into a Membrane, or the Pupil is quite covered. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis white, gray, yellow, green, ſometimes of a leaden colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as the green, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or black Choler is mingled amongſt it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seat</hi> of it is between the <hi>Cornea</hi> and the <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> humor, being ſometimes nearer to <hi>this,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>that.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is a Phlegmatick Humor, either collected there by the weakneſs of the Eyes, or by the Brain tranſmitted thither by reaſon of its abundance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] In the beginning, the Patient ſees every thing double, and of many colours; the Air ſeems to him full of Flies, Nets and Clouds, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure a great light. Thereupon his ſight leſſens, and all things appear as Spots, and at length there follows blindneſs. If it be juſt in
<pb facs="tcp:52336:40"/>
                        <figure>
                           <pb facs="tcp:52336:41"/>
                        </figure>
                        <figure>

the Center of the Pupil, yet covers not the whole Pupil; but leaveth round about the ſight ſome place free, and then all the Patient ſees, ſeems per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated. If the Pupil ſpreads it ſelf, when you rub the Eye with your Fingers, then is it yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; if it remains unmoved, there is no doubt of its being perfect.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] The imperfect Cataract may eaſily be cured in the beginning, by convenient External and Internal Medicines, in ſound Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in Patients of a middle Age. The leſs the Pupil is dilated, the leſs hope of Cure. The nearer the Suffuſion is to the Cryſtalline Humor, the more dangerous. If the Eye be turned to the Sun, and the Patient then ſees no glimmering of Light, there is no benefit to be expected from the Manual Operation. If the Humors of the Eye be commixt by the Needle, though the Membrane be removed, then blindneſs will certainly remain. If in the Operation you happen to touch the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Eye, called the <hi>Retina,</hi> the Patient will after that always ſee the Air, as if full of ſmall Hair and Flies. A Cataract commonly remains ſo ſoft unto the third year, that it will not follow the Needle; after the third or fourth year, it is ſo firm and hard, that it can by no Art be looſned. The Blood ſpilt by the uſe of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, cauſeth no danger, and ſoon ceaſeth of it ſelf. Though the Cataract be not altogether ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but divided into ſeveral pieces, the ſight doth often perfectly return within ſix or eight weeks, though before that time the whole Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould ſeem to be fruitleſs; which I ſpeak from manifold Experience.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] The <hi>Imperfect</hi> Cataract requires
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52336:43"/>
ſolely the Aid of the Phyſitian, who by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and ſtrengthening the Stomach and Head, have done much; to which purpoſe the conſerve of Marjoram, Roſemary, Beteny, <hi>Pulv. Diambre,</hi> &amp;c. are very good. And outwardly uſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing means.</p>
                     <p>Take Gum Tragacanth diſſolved in Eyebright water, two drams; Burnt Allom, one ſcruple: Make a Collyrium.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Celandine water, an ounce and half; White wine, half an ounce; Spirit of Wine, two drams; White Vitriol, ſix grains; Prepared Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a ſcruple; Glaſs of Antimony, five grains; Sugar-Candy, two drams and an half; Camphire, ſix grains: Mix it, and make a <hi>Collyrium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Juyce of Fennel, of Celandine, of each two ounces; Leaves of Rue and Marjoram, of each a Pugil; Eye-bright, one handful; of the Gall of an Oxe, four ounces; the Gall of Hens; an ounce; Red-Myrrhe, Aloes, of each a dram and half; Sarcocols, half an ounce; Camphire, two ſcruples: Mingle them, and let them be dilled in <hi>B. M.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Cataract be confirmed, then let the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Operation be your only refuge; but beware of attempting the Operation, if the Patient have long before complained, and ſtill complains of Head ach or pain of his Eyes; if the Body hath not been cleanſed in general, nor the Head in particular; and if the Patient be yet moleſted with a Fever, Sneezing, Coughing or Vomiting.</p>
                     <p>Having choſen a convenient ſeaſon of the year, ſome morning in the decreaſe of the Moon, and a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52336:43"/>
clear and ſerene Air, ſet the Patient in a Chair, and againſt him let the Operator ſit in one ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what higher than his, bind up his ſound Eye, and make him clap his hand about your waſte, without ſtirring them at all as long as you are buſie in the Operation. Let ſome body hold his Head faſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and hold you aſunder his Eye-lids, charging him to turn the Eye towards his Noſe, which when he doth, quickly thruſt your Needle into the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> half a ſtraws bredth from the <hi>Iris,</hi> and bring it unto the hollow of the Eye; when the Needle hath toucht the Cataract, endeavour therewith to preſs it gently, and ſo long from above downwards until it remains there; if it be ſtubborn, in ſpringing up again and again, divide it into ſeveral parts, and keep theſe particles, or the whole Cataract a little while <hi>under,</hi> that it may not return again before the Pupil of the Eye; then draw out the Needle, and bind up as well the ſound as the unſound Eye, with Linnen-cloths moiſtened in ſome Roſe water, the White of an Egg, and a little Allom mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Beware in the Operation, of hurting the Cryſtalline Humor, and the ſound Tunicles.</p>

After they have ſuckt a ſufficient quantity of Blood, and they fall not off them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, put upon their Heads a little Aſhes or Salt, and they will ſuddenly deſiſt from their work: they are not to be pull'd off by force, leſt they leave their heads behind them, from whence incurable wounds, and oftentimes Death ſucceeds.

                     <head>CHAP. XVIII. Of the Cutting in the Hard Parts.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THe Section which is uſed in the Hard and Bony Parts, is of four kinds,</hi> viz. <hi>Scraping, Filing, Sawing and Perforating, that is, Trepanning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scraping is uſed in a Fiſſure and foul Bone,</hi> in the <hi>Teeth</hi> alſo, when they are cruſted over with a Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous black ſubſtance; the Bones are to be ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped till you come to the ſound part, which is white and ſolid, and a little blood caſt forth; and to the Bone thus ſcraped, ſome drying Powder is to be applied; the <hi>Pericranium</hi> and <hi>Perioſtium</hi> muſt firſt be ſeperated from the Bone, before you go about this Operation; for by no means are they to be touched with the Inſtrumenr, neither like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the lips of the Wound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Filing</hi> is uſed in the Teeth; for when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally ſtand forth, and either in Eating or Speaking, are any hinderance to a man; then that which thus ſticks forth, is with a File to be taken off, which muſt be done carefully, without any injury to the neighouring parts, and by degrees, neither with two great a Violence, leſt it looſen the Tooth.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of the <hi>Saw</hi> is in a mortified part, when the Bone is to be cut a ſunder; concerning which Operation I ſhall ſuddenly ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Perforating</hi> or <hi>Trepanning</hi> is of great uſe, when the Bones are extreamly ſoul, but 'tis of greateſt uſe in thoſe effects, which the Fiſſure or a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52336:45"/>
of the Skull, or a Contuſion may produce: Seeing therefore this Operation is ſo full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, 'tis diligently to be enquired in what Caſes 'tis neceſſary, and in what 'tis not; for a Fiſſure as a Fiſſure, as likewiſe a Fracture as a Fracture, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not the Trepan as an operation without which they cannot be cured: In like manner a ſlight Contuſion doth not always occaſion ſuch dangerous ſymptoms, that the Trepan may not cauſe worſe; for oftentimes a ſmall quantity of extravaſated Blood, in Robuſt People, is often diſcuſſed by the work of Nature her ſelf; except the innate heat be weakened by external Cold, which in the uſe of the Trepan, let what care poſſibly be had, cannot be totally avoided; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the Blood is more often extravaſated between the two Membranes, the <hi>Dura-Mater</hi> and the <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> there the Trepan can ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe but little good; but in this caſe I would not much matter to divide the <hi>Dura Mater</hi>; Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence having taught us, that by the help of Art and Nature, hath an Inciſion, nay, Gangrene of the Part it ſelf been cured: <hi>Therefore for the moſt part but in three caſes is the Trepan required.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Where the looſe pieces of the Bones prick and wound the Meninges</hi>; which is to be known by the continual pricking pain preſently from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurting perceived, granted the Patient be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but if not, he is always feeling the Part affected wirh his hands: There happens likewiſe Contuſions of the Eyes, and Convulſions of the Limbs: Beſides, the quality of the Inſtrument which the Fracture hath made, will more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Where the firſt Table is only depreſſed, but the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52336:45"/>
ſecond broke</hi>; there being no way to give paſſage to the pieces, how well ſoever by Art or Nature ſeparated. The Signs of this, are, a Dimneſs, a Giddineſs, a Fever, Vomiting, and ſometimes an Apoplexy; a feeble ſmall Pulſe, and eſpecially about the Temples, the depreſſed Bone in ſome manner obſtructing the Circulation of the Blood in the Brain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Extravaſation</hi> of <hi>Blood, upon which follows Putrefaction,</hi> and if not remedied, <hi>Death it ſelf:</hi> The Signs which declare this Putrefaction, is a continued Fever, a great Heat in the Head, unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Sleep, Watchings, Inflammation of the Eyes, and light Delirium; and moreover, the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raments of Bodies are diligently to be conſider'd; for in Plethorick People, to thoſe above-named Symptoms are joyned, a Laughing, Talking idly, and Redneſs of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he whole Face. In the Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick appears a yellowneſs of the Face and Eyes, great Heat, and Madneſs. In the Phlegmatick, all the Symptoms are leſs; but ſometimes it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Palſie, ſometimes with an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy. In Melancholy men, a dread impertinent Talk, and Laughing is uſual.</p>
                     <p>Where the Trepan is neceſſary, apply it as ſoon as poſſible, leſt the putrifying Blood cauſeth greater evils, that is, on the third, fourth, or fifth day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The manner of Trepanning</hi> is thus, The Hair being ſhav'd, Let the Skin be divided with a double In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, inform of a Croſs to the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the greateſt diligence always the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peral Muſcles, and the Sutures of the Head; this done, bind up the Wound, except the Hemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage be ſmall (which very often is ſo violent,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52336:46"/>
that it hinders the Chirurgeon for ſome days from any further Operation) if it will then give leave, to divide likewiſe the <hi>Pericranium</hi> from the Skull: After ſome few hours (the Skull already bar'd of its <hi>Pericranium</hi>) the Patient well plac'd, his Head muſt by ſome Perſon be firmly held, his Ears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopt with Cotton; then ſet on the Trepan with a Pin, which muſt neither be upon the Fracture, nor upon the Sutures (although there are ſome that venture to apply it upon the very Sutures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) the Surgeon holding in his left hand the Inſtrument, and with his right, let him gently turn about the Trepan until it hath taken good hold round; then take out the Pin, and ſet the Trepan on again without it, moving it ſtill about, and if you ſee any ſmall Filings of the Skull, take off the Trepan and wipe them away; and the Trepan it ſelf is ſometimes to be dipt in the Oyl, that it may the eaſier be turned about; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Water, that it grows not hot. If any Blood appears, you may be certain that the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan had paſt the firſt <hi>Table,</hi> then are you to have a greater care, leſt the Trepan ſhould unawares ſlip in, and wound the Meninges, from whence oftentimes follows ſudden Death: For the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> inveſts the inſide of the Scull, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Pericranium</hi> doth the out-ſide, but yet not ſo ſtrongly joined to it, but that by a fall or blow, it may be eaſily ſeparated from the Skull.</p>
                     <p>When the piece of Bone, ſeparated by the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, begins to be looſe, you muſt with a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument put in, between the Skull and the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan'd part, and free it from the whole, and ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take it out with a pair of Forceps.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52336:46"/>If there remain any inequality from Trepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the inſide of the inward Table, that may cauſe injury to the Meninx, 'tis to be taken away with an Inſtrument called <hi>Lenticula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that there may be a diſcharge given to the coagulated Blood and Matter, the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is to be compreſſed with an Inſtrument called a <hi>Decuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorium.</hi> To effect the ſame, 'tis commended that the Patient (if ſenſible) his Mouth and Noſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut, hold his Breath, ſo that the Brain being raiſed upward, the concreted and corrupted Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be thrown forth; but very ſeldom is the Matter diſcharg'd by this only remedy; for the Chirurgion hath need enough of the <hi>Decuſſorium, Spunges, Lint,</hi> and the like Inſtruments; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and delineation of the which, you may find in <hi>Joh.

                        <hi>ISſues are little Ulcers made by Art in a ſound part of the Body by a red-hot Iron, Launcet, Sciſſars, or corroſive Medicine, to evacuate ſuperfluous humors, and ſo either to cure or prevent Diſeaſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe troubleſome Gueſts are rarely courted, and are chiefly preſcribed when we ſee gentler Medicines to profit nothing, and after the Body hath been well purged.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In what part ſoever they are made,</hi> it is always to be obſerv'd they never ought to be inſerted in the beginning, middle or end of a Muſcle, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the ſpace between two Muſcles, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the knowledge of Anatomy, except ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of Quacks, whoſe cuſtom hath taught them to find out a place ev'n blindfold. In the Head, the place is the middle of the <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Suture,</hi> made oftner by other Nations than is a practice amongſt us. In the <hi>Neck</hi> they are not ſo often made, how neceſſary ſoever they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The <hi>Italians</hi> uſe to make them between the Shoulders with ſucceſs. In other places they are either very troubleſome or inconvenient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52336:47"/>The <hi>Manner</hi> of making Iſſues is divers: If you make uſe of the <hi>Potential Cautery,</hi> apply a Plaiſter to the part, having a hole in the middle about the bigneſs of a Pea, in which lay a little <hi>Coſtick,</hi> and over that a Bolſter and another Plaiſter; and after three or four hours, take off the Plaiſters, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Eſcar a Plaiſter of <hi>Diapalma</hi>; dreſs it twice a day, that it may the ſooner ſeparate.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which deſire it rather by <hi>Inciſion,</hi> the Skin being taken up either by the Forceps, or by the Hand, divide it with a pair of Sciſſars or Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. If Burning be preferred before the other ways, burn the Skin, but not the ſubjacent Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; for indeed the Skin it ſelf is not to be wholly penetrated, oftentimes the touching only the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of it is enough.</p>
                     <p>When the Scar falls off, take little hard Doſſels made of Lint, ſpred upon them ſome Deterſive Medicine, and preſs them into the Ulcer, until they have made a ſufficient Impreſſion; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward keep in this Cavity a Ball of Wax, Wood, or Silver, or a Pea, which is to be often taken out, and another put in, and ſo is to be continued till the Diſeaſe be cured, or Weakneſs hinder.</p>

                     <p>There are <hi>three Inſtruments</hi> neceſſary to perform this Operation; <hi>A pair of Forceps, a Needle,</hi> and <hi>String.</hi> The <hi>Forceps</hi> which are to hold up the Skin, muſt be perforated of each ſide; the <hi>Needle</hi> muſt be three-pointed, and anſwer to the hole of the <hi>Forceps,</hi> which it muſt paſs through. The <hi>String</hi> is to be of <hi>Silk,</hi> not exceeding the thickneſs of the <hi>Needle:</hi> Let the Chirurgion take up the Skin with the <hi>Forceps</hi> and gripe it hard, which being ſomewhat ſtupified, the Patient will feel the leſs pain; then let him paſs the Needle red-hot through both the holes of the Forceps, Skin and all; after which, with another Needle let him bring through the thread: The firſt day, to eaſe pain, apply to the Part Lint dipt in Whites of Eggs and Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water mixt together: Afterward let Digeſtion be procured by the uſe of convenient Medicines; when digeſted, let the String be drawn every day, ſometimes to this ſide, ſometimes to that, ſo that the mattery part may hang out of the Wound.

                     <p>After this manner many Authors, both Antient and Modern, order the making the <hi>Seton</hi>; but this Oparation is much eaſier perform'd, if in the right place the Chirurgion take up the Skin with one hand, and his Servant with another, and ſo paſs it through with a ſharp-pointed Needle, but

                     <p>We treat of the laſt firſt, to wit, <hi>The Extraction of Bullets out of the Body</hi>; which is not difficult, if it appears whether it be nearer to the part where it made its entrance, or to the oppoſite to which it hath penetrated.</p>
                     <p>If it be obſerved to be near the Orifice; let it be drawn forth with a convenient Inſtrument; if nearer to the oppoſite part, let the Inciſion be made upon it, and there taken forth: But if the Bullet cannot be found out by a Probe, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is to be ſo placed, that the Bullet by its own weight may come forth; which if it happens not to do, the Wound is to be cured; and let the Chirurgeon expect until the Bullet ſhews it ſelf near the Skin, which very often requires a long time.</p>

                        <p>The Mother feels no more the Motion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, although ſtrengthening Cordials be exhibit'd; but in this caſe when the Infant is as it were tir'd, ſtirs it ſelf a little, you have a much more certain Sign. Take a piece of the Crum of Bread, and dip it in Canary Wine, and apply it to the Navel of the Mother, then open a Vein in the Foot, and if by the uſe of theſe things, there follows not a motion of the Infant, it is a very ill Sign.</p>
                        <p>When the Mother turns her ſelf from one ſide to the other, and perceives the Child to fall on the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52336:50"/>
ſide laid upon, like a ſtone or a great weight; the Face, and chiefly the Lips grow pale, the extream parts cold, as likewiſe the lower Belly, the Paps begin to grow lank, the Breath becomes fetid, great pains of the Head, Faintings and Fevers, Water and ſtinking Gleet flows out of the Womb; If the After-Birth be excluded before the Child, 'tis impoſſible the Child can live long; but the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſign of all is, if the Membrane of the Head of the Child be not obſerved to be any longer tenſe; for as long as it is tenſe, the Infant lives.</p>

                        <p>But firſt, it is diligently to be enquired into, which of the Cauſes it is that hinders the Birth: If the Child be greater and the paſſage ſtraighter than uſually, they ought to be dilated; this ſome Midwives do with convenient Inſtruments, and ſo draw forth the Child alive; but where they are wanting, the Midwife muſt clutch her hand very cloſe, and thruſt through the Internal Orifice into the Womb it ſelf; then putting her Fingers one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another through the Orifice into the inner part of the Womb, to diſcover the ſituation of the Child; and if ſhe finds the Arms or Feet to come inconveniently, let her gently raiſe it up, bringing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52336:50"/>
the Head downwards, which if ſhe finds to be next the Orifice, if poſſible, let her put in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand through the <hi>Pudenda</hi> into the Womb, and ſo with both her hands laying hold of it, draw it forth.</p>
                        <p>But if this Operation cannot be performed, then with a hook firmly fixt (leſt it injure the inſide of the Womb) in the Mouth, Eye or Ear of the Child, and ſo gently draw it forth; and if the <hi>Faetus</hi> will not follow, then with another Hook, blunt on the out-ſide, and ſharp within, let him cut in pieces the Belly, Breaſt, or Head of the Child; and if the Arms or Legs cannot be brought forth, let him cut them off; ſo at length, being deprived of its Limbs, the remainder may be drawn forth.</p>
                        <p>But if by this way the Woman can neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, with a ſharp and ſtrong Knife, the Limbs one after another are to be cut out, and ſo the Child be drawn forth by piece-meal: It is neceſſary that this be perform'd by none but a good Anatomiſt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Secundine</hi> will preſently follow the Birth, for it's of no uſe, that being excluded; for the Mouth of the Womb, ſuddenly after delivery, is ſo cloſly ſhut, that not without great pain it can admit the Hand of the Midwife; therefore the Midwife, as ſoon as may be, is to draw it forth, and with her fingers, if it ſticks very cloſe to the Womb, gently to ſeparate it, but not pluck it a way forcibly, which is mortal; and although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Writers and Midwives of inferior Rank, little regard the retention of the After-Birth for ſome time after delivery; yet I think I have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to pronounce it, one of the greateſt Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of Womens Labour.</p>

                        <p>The Patient having receiv'd convenient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to be placed upon a Form; then let the Skin and fubjacent Muſcles be drawn up as much as poſſible, by a ſtrong Man, and there kept; and an inch above the place where the Member is deſign'd to be taken off, with a narrow Ligature is the Part to be very hard bound; this done, with a diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring Knife, the Skin with the Fleſh is ſpeedily to be cut all round to the Part, and the <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> by ſcraping, is to be ſeparated from the Bone; and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52336:51"/>
if it be where there is a double Bone, as in the Leg, and below the Elbow, the Fleſh and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between them is to be divided; which being performed, let the Bone be ſeparated with a very ſharp Saw. If the Flux of Blood be not great, to apply only thoſe Medicines that ſtop Blood, will be ſufficient; but if great, an actual Cautery is to be uſed, which is only to be applied upon the great Veſſels; then let the Ligature be taken off, and the Part be fitly bound up.</p>
                        <p>If either the Patient or Chirurgeon be averſe to the uſe of a Cautery, then as ſoon as the Member is taken off, let the Skin together with the Fleſh, in four diſtinct places oppoſite one to the other, be taken up with a Needle and waxed Thread, and the Ligature being looſened above, or drawn down, that, if poſſible, they may meet: So by this way is the <hi>Hemorage</hi> ſtaid, the Bone preſerved from all danger, and the Wound ſooner cured. But this way is painful and troubleſom, therefore ought it the ſeldomer to be uſed.</p>

                     <p>SArcocele, <hi>which is a Fleſhy Rupture, is a Tumor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Nature, produced from impure Blood, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in too great quantity itno the Teſticles, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into Fleſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Definition, received by the beſt Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chirurgeons, I note two things: 1. The <hi>cauſe</hi> of this Tumor, <hi>not to be impure Blood,</hi> ſeeing the beſt, may produce it; <hi>not ſimply abounding in quantity,</hi> becauſe it alſo happens in waſted Bodies, though 'tis not ſo ſoon generated, nor arrives to ſuch a greatneſs in theſe, as in thoſe Bodies; but <hi>the true cauſe is the Eroſion, Rupture or Dilatation of the Membranes which cloſe the Mouths of the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Veſſels, that the nutritious Blood may not flow too ſuddenly into the Part</hi>; from whence, more Blood flows into the Part than what is required for its nouriſhment; and Nature changeth that Blood which otherwiſe would purifie into a fleſhy Subſtance. 2. <hi>This fleſh ſometimes grows to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the common Tunicles of the</hi> Scrotum, <hi>and not to the Teſticles,</hi> in which caſe it may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52336:52"/>
without either hurting, or cutting of them out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> are, the hardneſs, and ſlow encreaſe of the Tumor, which is rather more troubleſome than painful, except accompanied with ſharp Humors; no appearance of any Tumor in the Groin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] A <hi>Sarcocele</hi> is hardly cured by the help of Medicines, and ſeldom by manual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, without taking off the Teſticle, if it extends it ſelf into the Groins, for the moſt part incurable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] In the beginning, when the Membranes of the Veſſels being eroded, broke or dilated, do give leave for too much leave to iſſue forth, <hi>Bleeding, and the uſe of Repelling and Reſtringent Medicines profit much</hi>; but when it hath begun to augment, then we may uſe theſe following means: Let there be made a little Orifice into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> rather in its Superior then Inferior Part, through which, by the help of Plegets let Suppurating Medicines be applied, ſo that if poſſible, to waſte the Fleſh, every dreſſing diligently wiping away the Matter, but not at all, that the remaining Fleſh may be the better conſumed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If theſe things ſucceed not,</hi> draw forth the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticle, and by Inciſion take off as much Fleſh as may be done without injury to it; then reſtore it again into its place, and the remainder of the Fleſh endeavor to conſume by Suppuration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But if there be no hope of curing this Rupture by the recited means,</hi> draw forth the Hernious Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as far as you may, then paſs once or twice a Silken Thred above the Tumor by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>; then paſs both ends of the Silk through the Orifice it ſelf, ſo that which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52336:53"/>
was on the right ſide, may be on the left, and that of the left, on the right; and having ordered that the proceſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> may be tied with a knot, then cut off the Teſticle, letting both the ends of the Silk hang out of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and ſo cure it as another Wound.</p>
                     <p>I cannot here but friendly adviſe, 1. <hi>The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon ought to conſider well of the Cauſe, before he comes to the Operation it ſelf</hi>; for ſometimes the <hi>Paraſtates</hi> are ſo ſwell'd, eſpecially the Teſticles being Scirrhous, that they may eaſily deceive a very curious Examiner. 2. The Ligature ought to be made as near to the Tumor as poſſible, for by how much the higher part of the Proceſs of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> be perforated, it is obſerved to be ſo much the thicker, which thing will retard the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration and the falling of the Thread; in the mean time <hi>Convulſions</hi> coming on, denounce death. 3. The Spermatick Veſſels detain'd in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> oftentimes by Natures variety, exceed the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles themſelves in greatneſs, which cauſes no other inconvenience but only Fear, which I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be true, in more than one.</p>

                        <hi>The Cauſe is a Pituitous, Salt or Earthy Matter,</hi> which neither by heat nor cold, by <hi>a peculiar la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidifying quality is changed into a Stone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] The Urine is white, ſlimy, crude and troubled, ſuddenly adhering to the Urinal; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is bloody, ſometimes ſandy or gravelly; ſometimes full of little Threads, and not ſeldom ſuppreſt; a great thirſt, a frequent making of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, but with pain and by drops: The Patients place themſelves with their Thighs acroſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways holding their Privy-Parts in their hands, preſſing the bottom of their Belly; the Privy-Part is always erected, very painful to go or walk, in the Region of the Belly a weight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Patient ſeldom making Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going to Stool, the Inteſtine commonly falls out, eſpecially in young People.</p>
                     <p>Although all theſe Signs ſeem plain, yet they may ſometimes deceive a Phiſician; it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cuſtom with a <hi>Catheter</hi> paſſed through the <hi>Ureter</hi> into the Bladder, then thruſting in one or two fingers into the <hi>Anus,</hi> not only to ſearch for the Stone, but alſo underſtand its greatneſs. But this ſearching was ſo very painful, that it was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, through fear of pain, to have it permitted a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time; and this thing gave occaſion to have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the ſecond time of ſearching, all Inſtruments neceſſary for cutting out the Stone; but the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and great Prince of Phyſicians hath now granted to thoſe miſerable Patients, thoſe Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, who not only without <hi>Catheter,</hi> but alſo without pain, both in old People and Children, which can moſt certainly find out the Stone; and for this Reaſon they Excel the ſo much Eſteem'd <hi>French-men.</hi> I wiſh other places may may enjoy the ſame Artiſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:52336:56"/>
                        <hi>Prognoſtick.</hi>] A crumbling Stone ſeldom, a hard Stone can never be waſted by Medicines, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever boaſting perſons may ſay; ſometimes it is ſo ſoft, that by the very <hi>Catheter</hi> it ſelf it may be broke to pieces in the neck of the Bladder, and be brought forth; ſometimes through its ſmalneſs it comes forth whole; ſometimes it ſticks in the <hi>Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi> out of which, without danger and great pain it cannot be removed; if it ſticks in the <hi>Tunicles</hi> of the Bladder, or grows to the Superficies of the Interior Coat, it cannot be taken away by Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the death of the Patient: By how much the greater the Stone is, the Operation is the more dangerous and painful. Stones are often drawn forth out of Womens Bladders about the bigneſs of an Olive, or a Walnut, without Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but this way by Dilatation, of Extracting the Stone, is ſo dangerous, that it ought not to be performed but by experienced Chirurgeons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] Stones generated in the Kidneys, Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or other parts of the Body (for, they may in any) in general, require the aſſiſtance of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; but we in this place treat only of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of drawing them forth out of the Bladder by Inciſion. There are ſeveral ways by various Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors propoſed; but that which follows, is the moſt common, and moſt ſure.</p>
                     <p>Let the Chirurgeon place his Patient on a ſoft Pillow in a ſtrong mans Lap, after he has three or four times jumpt from a high place, then let him tie both his hands to the ſoles of his Feet, and let two ſtanders by hold each Knee, extending them as far as may be one from the other; then let him take the firſt Finger of his left-Hand, or if neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity requires, the two firſt, anointed with Oyl of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52336:56"/>
Lillies, Roſes, or freſh Almonds, and thruſt them up the Fundament, with his right hand gently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> ſo that the Stone may ſlip down under the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> into the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> which when brought thither by the foreſaid Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, let him make Inciſion with a ſharp Knife in the left ſide between the Teſticles and the <hi>Anus,</hi> near to the Suture of the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> cutting to the very Stone it ſelf; and if it comes not out of the Wound it ſelf, nor by the thruſting forth of the Fingers which are in the <hi>Inteſtinum rectum,</hi> let him draw it forth with a pair of Forceps, or which is better, with the <hi>Lapidillum</hi> or Spoon. The Stone being taken out, and all the Ligatures looſed, let the Wound be bound up according to Art, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, ſtopping Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> of Meal and Bole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the greateſt care to conſolidate it as ſoon as poſſible, leſt the Patient labour with a dropping of his Urine through the wounded part: And this is the manner of drawing forth the Stone, which Chirurgeons uſe to call <hi>Apparatus Minor,</hi> which chiefly is uſed in Children, although there are thoſe which proceed thus in People of full growth: But in our Country always this Inciſion is made by them whoſe Fingers are fitted for this Operation,</p>
                     <p>But in People of full Age it is ſometimes very difficult to reach the Stone by the Fingers put up into the Fundament, and after the ſame manner to bring it down into the <hi>Perinoeum,</hi> if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſible, as many think it; therefore there is another way found out, which they call <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus Major</hi>; the Patient is put on a Table, and bound, and held as above, the Chirurgeon through the <hi>Uretra</hi> paſſeth a Director into the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52336:57"/>
Bladder to the Stone, then Inciſion being made as obove, in the hollow of the Director, puts in the Conductor, taking the Director out of the <hi>Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> he paſſeth into the Wound the Forceps, the <hi>Lapidillum,</hi> or other Inſtrument convenient for drawing out the Stone, by which he may both lay hold of it, and draw it forth, not making uſe of his Fingers in the <hi>Anus,</hi> except great neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to it. Where the Stone is bigger than the Orifice, and cannot come forth, the Wound is to be enlarged, or the Stone to be broken into pieces by the Forceps, and ſo drawn forth in parts: This done, the Binding and Conſolidating the Wound, ought to be the ſame as in Children, giving it a ſtitch if it be too great, putting in a Silver-Pipe for two or three days, that may give paſſage to the Concreted Blood, Slime and Sandy Urine.</p>
                     <p>The manner is the ſame in Women, but only the Fingers are not put into the <hi>Anus,</hi> but into the Privy-Parts, and the <hi>Catheter</hi> muſt not be crooked, but ſtraight, and much ſhorter than the other.</p>
                     <p>There is likewiſe another manner of drawing forth the Stone; the Chirurgeon thruſting his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the <hi>Anus,</hi> preſſeth the Stone upwards to the Belly; then through the Wound made in the right Muſcle above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> according to the <hi>ductus</hi> of its Fibres, by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillum</hi> or Forceps draw forth the Stone; by this way is never obſerved any coming forth of the Urine, and the place ſuppoſed convenient to draw forth the Stone: But this Operation in it ſelf is dangerous and troubleſome, and if the Lips of the Wound made in the Bladder unite not to the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> there follows an Ulcer of the Bladder, more painful, but leſs cureable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52336:57"/>
than the Stone it ſelf; which inconveniences have cauſed it not to be reckoned among other Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by true Practiſers.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Cauſes</hi> are, 1. <hi>The Parts of the Body remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of their Natural place.</hi> 2. <hi>The Four Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,

as well Natural as Preternatural,</hi> viz, <hi>Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Choler, Phlegm, Melancholy,</hi> to which likewiſe we add <hi>Serum</hi> and <hi>Wind.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Tumors</hi> for the moſt part are generated from the Humors, and that either by <hi>Congeſtion,</hi> or <hi>Fluxion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They</hi> come by <hi>Congeſtion,</hi> when the Natural heat of the Part being diminiſhed, the good Humors are ill concocted, or the vicious are not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evacuated.</p>
                     <p>By <hi>Fluxion,</hi> from a two-fold Cauſe, <hi>External, viz.</hi> a Fall, Blow, External Heat, too great Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c. Internal, viz.</hi> Pain, Superabundancy, Thinneſs, Acrimony of Humors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Signs of Tumors are, an Extention of the Part, Pain, Redneſs, Heat, Hardneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe are better explained in particular Tumors, than in general.</p>
                     <p>The times of Tumors (for all curable Tumors have four) are as followeth, <hi>Beginning,</hi> when the Part begins to ſwell; <hi>Increaſe,</hi> the ſwelling, pain, and other Symptoms are augmented; <hi>State,</hi> the Symptoms ſtand at a ſtay, and grow not worſer; <hi>Declination,</hi> when the Symptoms are diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſtick.</hi>] Tumors produced from Phlegm or Melancholy, are hard of Cure. Thoſe are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, which are generated from corrupt Blood or Choler, which ſeizeth the Internal Parts, which ſhew themſelves about the greater Veſſels, Joynts, Nerves, and the Membranous or Noble Parts: Thoſe that are of great bigneſs, and that happen in <hi>Cacochymick</hi> Bodies.</p>
                     <p>They are <hi>Terminated four ways</hi>; 1. By <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation,</hi> which the leſſening of the Symptoms do declare. 2. By <hi>Suppuration,</hi> wherein the Pain
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52336:59"/>
and Pulſation is increaſed together with a Fever. 3. By <hi>Induration,</hi> which the too often and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate uſe of Repelling and Diſſipating Medicines hath cauſed. 4. <hi>Degenerating into a Gangrene,</hi> from the defect of Natural Heat.</p>
                     <p>The Cure is performed two ways: 1. <hi>By hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering any further Flux to the Part.</hi> 2. <hi>In removing that which is already gathered in the Part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſtay the Flux of Humors, 1. <hi>By Intercepting.</hi> 2. <hi>By Repelling.</hi> 3. <hi>By Revelling.</hi> 4. <hi>By Derivation.</hi> 5. <hi>By Corroborating the Part it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Matter already gathered, is taken away, 1. <hi>By Aſtringing and Repelling Medicines,</hi> to wit, when 'tis thin, and ſticks not too firm to the Parts. 2. By <hi>Reſolvents,</hi> when it is thick, and adheres more firmly to the Part. 3. By <hi>Suppuratives,</hi> when the other are too weak. 4. By <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Cutting,</hi> when other means effect nothing.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> hath four <hi>Indications.</hi> The firſt of theſe reſpects a good Diet; let him chuſe a clear Air, his Meat and Drink little, and that cooling; all hot, ſweet and fat things, as Pepper and Ginger, are hurtful; as alſo the motion of the Body, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Part affected; Sleep is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: All Coſtivenefs, Anger and Venery are noxious,</p>
                     <p>Second, that ſtops the further Flux of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which may be performed by Revulſion, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, Repelling and Interception; therefore let a Vein be opened as ſoon as poſſible, it being moſt neceſſary: Revulſion is made in the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and moſt Remote part, Derivation in the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt: If you may not open a Vein, you muſt uſe Leeches and Scarifications. Whilſt theſe things are done, ſeeing the Body is ſeldom clean, but that always there are ill Humors mixt with the Blood, by Purging rightly uſed, and often repeated, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Bleeding, we effect much.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Part affected requires Repelling Medicines, from which we muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, Where, 1. The Noble Parts ſend the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52336:60"/>
to convenient places, and to the <hi>Glandules.</hi> 2. Where the Humors are Malignant. 3. When Critical. 4. When the Body is very impure. 5. When the part affected is very weak or painful. 6. Where the Inflammation is about ſome Noble Part.</p>

                        <hi>Difference.] 'Tis perfect,</hi> when ſprung from Choler alone; as it is imperfect, when Blood, Phlegm or Melancholy is mixt with it; from whoſe Appellation it likewiſe takes its name, and is called <hi>Eryſipelas, Phlegmonodes, Oedematodes, Scirrhodes</hi>; ſometimes an Ulcer is joined with it, which ſometimes conſumes only the Skin, other times the Fleſh it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe</hi> is Choler, ſeldom alone, ſometimes mixt with Phlegm and Melancholy, but oftentimes with Blood or Serum; whence, thoſe Medicines that are proper for a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> oftentimes do good in an <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi>

                     <p>Purging is very neceſſary, therefore thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines deſcribed in the third Chapter of the firſt Part, are here convenient.</p>
                     <p>A perfect <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> admits not of <hi>Bleeding</hi>; for the fatneſs of the Blood bridles the ſharpneſs of the Choler: But if the Fever be vehement, the Flux great, and any Blood (which for the moſt part happens) be mingled with the Choler, 'tis convenient to bleed, eſpecially in Plethorick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: In delicate and weak Bodies, Cupping-Glaſſes, with Scarification or Leeches, if things ſhould require, will ſerve,</p>
                     <p>Theſe being thus done, to provoke Sweat, is the beſt of all other Remedies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Outwardly</hi> to the affected part, <hi>ought not to be applied,</hi> 1. <hi>Oyl,</hi> or any <hi>fat thing</hi>; as thoſe things which yield matter to the Choler, eaſily increaſe Putrefaction: But if yet it is your pleaſure to uſe them, they muſt be tempered by mixing them with other Medicines. 2. <hi>Repellents,</hi> except the <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas</hi> be very little, the Part affected remote from the Noble Part, and the Humors be yet flowing, and then they ought not to be uſed without Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolvents mixt with them.</p>
                     <p>The Cataplaſms deſcribed in the foregoing Chapter, may for the moſt part be applied here with ſucceſs.</p>

                           <hi>Hydrocephalus</hi> is always of difficult Cure: Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Brain, or between the Brain and <hi>Meninges,</hi> is very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but leſs dangerous, when collected between the <hi>Dura,</hi> and <hi>Pia Mater,</hi> or between the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and the Skull: For the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> may be divided into a Lancet, if you can come at it; but leaſt danger of all, when detained without the Skull.</p>

                        <p>But which of them ſoever you chuſe, have a care of diſcharging all the Water at once, for in the very Operation it ſelf the Patient dies, or at leaſt is very much debilitated; for till the end of the Cure, all the Water is not to be taken away, leſt the debilitated Parts be deprived of that heat which the Water poſſeſt, do corrupt: but rather what remains muſt be conſumed by Internal and External Diſcuſſives; and this is to be obſerved in all Watry Tumors that are Cured by a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centheſis.</p>

                        <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] The <hi>Bubo</hi> that is not <hi>Malign,</hi> is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52336:72"/>
not dangerous, except it be long diſcuſſing, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purating, and then fear leſt it Fiſtulate: In the Arm-pits it is ſooner brought to maturity than in the Groins; and here ſooner than behind the Ears: On the contrary, a <hi>Malign</hi> is for the moſt part a ſign of ſudden Death, although all outward ſigns may appear well.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venereal</hi> is not mortal, but of hard Cure, and for the moſt part precedes the Pox; chiefly when by Bleeding, or the uſe of repelling Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, the Matter is returned from the External, into Internal parts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] Diet the ſame as in a <hi>Phlegmon</hi>: In a <hi>Benign, Purging</hi> is neceſſary, provided it be not with too ſtrong Medicines: <hi>Bleeding,</hi> except a great Fever, or a <hi>Plethora</hi> require, I admit no more of it here, than of <hi>Repellent Medicines</hi>; for 'tis unſeemly that Natures Aſſiſter ſhould return that into the interior parts, which Nature her ſelf did eject (which for the moſt part is Critical.) <hi>Sweating</hi> in all <hi>Buboes,</hi> profits much: <hi>Scarification</hi> hath no place here, except in <hi>Malignant,</hi> nor <hi>Leeches,</hi> but where very much inflamed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>External</hi> Cure is to be managed ſo, that the Humor may be diſſipated with <hi>Reſolvents,</hi> which by reaſon of the frigidity of the <hi>Glandules,</hi> are required the ſtronger; adding alſo <hi>Attractives</hi> to them; for in all, I ſuſpect leſt the Matter be not perfectly thrown forth: But in a painful <hi>Bubo,</hi> 'tis firſt neceſſary <hi>to eaſe the pain,</hi> before you come to any other Medicines.</p>

                        <p>If it yield not to diſcuſſion, Suppuration is to be endeavoured; which is of all, the ſafeſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: Being ſuppurated, let it forthwith be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but rather by Inciſion, than Cautery: And ſo let it be kept opened until the whole Tumor be diſſolved.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Children,</hi> for the moſt part, we commit it wholly to Nature; only preſcribing a good Diet, and forbidding the often touch of the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hands; or we apply the Plaiſter of Diachilon, or of Muſilages: 'tis alſo often cured by the only uſing of Oyl of Olives, Rape, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil, or white Lillies.</p>
                        <p>In a <hi>Peſtilential Bubo,</hi> neither Bleeding or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging (whatſoever others ſay) muſt be uſed: Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks and Refrigeratives are convenient; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <hi>Attractives</hi> in the beginning, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>

                     <p>If cauſed from an <hi>External Heat,</hi> or ſtopping of the Pores, the Redneſs is changed into White, then into Black; Pulſation and Pain ceaſe; the Senſes leſſened; and at laſt there appear ſome <hi>Puſtules,</hi> from whence iſſue a gleety Humor.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>from defect of Aliment,</hi> there is neither <hi>Pain, Inflammation</hi> or <hi>Tumor</hi>; the Body waxeth cold, and for the moſt part ſeizeth upon the Joynts.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe.</hi>] All Arteries, except thoſe that are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, through the Brain and upper parts, conſiſt of a double Tunicle; the inmoſt of which being either corroded or broke, the External may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſo much (without a Rupture of it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever others ſay) as to cauſe an <hi>Aneuriſm:</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, where the Tumor is of the bigneſs of ones Fiſt, it cannot be but that the External alſo muſt be either corroded or broke. Anatomy doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Opinion, which the Studious in the Art of Chirurgery may enquire into.</p>
                     <p>This Tumor alſo may be cauſed, where an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery be divided; ſo that the External Tunicle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Muſcles, the Internal, by reaſon of the continual pulſation, remains open.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] A Swelling increaſing by degrees, of the ſame colour as the skin; a continual Pulſation: If the Tumor be little, it eaſily yields to the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſo that it altogether diſappears, but ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returns again; but if great, not ſo eaſily yielding to the touch, not ſo ſtrong a Pulſation: but there is a noiſe obſerved, as of boiling Water; yet in the Head and Jaw, I have found after death an <hi>Aneuriſm,</hi> which while the man was alive,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52336:82"/>
there could be no Pulſe perceived: In the hard parts is greater Circumſpection to be uſed, than in the ſoft and fleſhy.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But where the Tumor is encreaſed, there are ſome would have the Skin divided, and the Artery tied both above and below, and cut out the middle with the Tumor, and looſen not the Ligatures, till the Wound is perfectly cured, and there is no fear of an Hemorrage; but this Operation is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, painful and troubleſome, and oft-times of little Benefit: But to preſerve Life, I would take off the Member.</p>

                     <p>OPthalmia <hi>is an Inflammation of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Eye from Blood, with Redneſs, Pain, and ſhedding of Tears.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Difference.</hi>] A light Inflammation, and which depends from external Cauſes, is called a Baſtard-<hi>Opthalmia, Taraxis,</hi> or <hi>Epiphora</hi>; but a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, accompanied with pain and tears, a true <hi>Opthalmia.</hi> And if it be ſo great, that the Eye-lids are ſo inflamed, and as it were turned inward, 'tis called <hi>Chemoſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes</hi> are two. 1. Internal, as Blood, oft-times mixt with <hi>Serum</hi> or Choler; ſeldom with Phlegm or Melancholy. 2. External, as Smoak, Duſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> vary according to the variety of Cauſes: If it proceed from too great a quantity of <hi>Blood,</hi> the Face looks red, and the Veſſels of the Eyes are extended: If either from more of <hi>Serum</hi> or Choler, the Redneſs of the Face is leſs, but the Tears are more ſharp, and the pain greater; if from more of <hi>Phlegm,</hi> the reddiſh pain, Heat and Acrimony of Tears are more remiſs; and the Eye-lids at night are as it were glewed together: If from any thing of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> there are but few Tears, and the Eye-lids are not cloſed together, the Inflammation is not great, but ſtubborn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi>] An <hi>Opthalmia</hi> is flower cured in Children, than in old people. Continual pain menaceth Blindneſs, by how much greater the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation is, ſo much the more dangerous it is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] The Diet muſt be the ſame as in a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>; all ſharp things are carefully to be avoided; as Garlick, Radiſhes, Muſtard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> little or no Suppers profit: <hi>Purging,</hi> the uſe of Gliſters, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be oft-times re-iterated; as alſo <hi>Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Glaſſes, Leeches, Bliſters</hi>; ſometimes alſo <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Iſſues,</hi> and <hi>Artereotomy</hi> it ſelf, which is not to be done by any but an expert Chirurgeon;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52336:83"/>
                        <hi>Sneezing</hi> is hurtful; <hi>Provoking of Sweat</hi> is ſometimes neceſſary, ſometimes not; which the Phyſician muſt diſtinguiſh: <hi>Dieureticks</hi> are of great uſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they are not too hot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>External</hi> Remedies vary according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cauſes; if from <hi>Smoke</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> let them be extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>If from <hi>Duſt,</hi> or <hi>any thing got into the Eyes,</hi> 'tis to be taken forth, which is often performed by blowing, or by the ſpurting in of Roſe-water.</p>
                     <p>If from the <hi>inverſion</hi> of the <hi>Eye-lids</hi>; the Hairs are to be cut off, or wholly to be pull'd out.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Eye-lids are glew'd together,</hi> they are to be ſeparated, with Butter, Beer, or Cream, the Rheum is gently to be wiped; and let the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent have a Care, leſt by the rubbing of his Eyes, he increaſeth his Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>Fat things are here hurtful: <hi>Repellent Medicines,</hi> except in the very beginning, are not to be uſed, or in a very ſlight <hi>Opthalmia.</hi>

                     <p>A Quinſie <hi>is a Tumor of the Jaws, from Blood, hindring Deglutition and Reſpiration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Difference.</hi>] 'Tis divided into three ſpecies; the firſt is called <hi>Cynanthe,</hi> when the Muſcles of the <hi>Larinx</hi> are inflamed: the Symptoms here are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous, although neither internally nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally appear any Tumor; the Patient puts forth his Tongue like a tired Dog, to fetch his breath. Second is <hi>Synanche,</hi> when the Tumor ſhews it ſelf within the Jaws; the Symptoms are likewiſe here great, but much leſs than in <hi>Cynanthe.</hi> Third is, <hi>Paraſynanche,</hi> when the Tumor appears more Externally than Internally; and in this the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes are leaſt of all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe</hi> is <hi>Blood,</hi> for the moſt part mixt with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> or Choler; ſeldom with Phlegm or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> of an approaching <hi>Quinſie,</hi> are, a ſtiffneſs of the Neck, ſwallowing and breathing ſomewhat hindred, an unuſual heat and pain in the Jaws, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when Quinſies are Epidemick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs of a preſent</hi> are, a ſuffocating Aſthma: ſwallowing hindred, which often increaſeth to ſo great a heighth, that Drink taken in at the Mouth, comes forth again through the Noſtrils, Pain, Redneſs, Tumor for the moſt part, alſo a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fever; the Tongue likewiſe ſwell'd, and the Voice altered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52336:85"/>
                        <hi>Prognoſtick.</hi>] A perfect Quinſie never wants danger, but ſometimes ſuffocates the Patient the firſt day, generally before the fourth: If the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be not ſuddenly concocted and thrown forth, it is deſperate; if the <hi>Vertebraes</hi> be laxated, death is near at hand; foaming at mouth is a ſign of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death; if the Patient be taken with a pain of the Head, a <hi>Delirium,</hi> raving and death it ſelf ſuddenly follows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.] Bleeding</hi> in this caſe effects much, both by taking away of the Inflammation, and by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering its increaſe, which is to be performed at firſt ſight therefore let the Median or Cephalick Vein of the ſide moſt affected be opened, though in Women with Child, then the Vein under the Tongue: <hi>Cupping Glaſſes</hi> with <hi>Scarification</hi> may alſo be applied to the Neck about the ſecond <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebra,</hi> Shoulders and Breaſt; <hi>Leeches, Cauteries,</hi> and <hi>Bliſters</hi> do much good, eſpecially in them that are Subject to Quinſie: In the mean time, if the Patient can ſwallow, let ſome purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines be given him; if not, let a Cliſter be caſt in, with Bleeding, which muſt be often reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as occaſion requires.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gargariſms</hi> then, and other External Medicines are to be uſed; which in the beginning are to be more Repelling, afterwards more Diſcuſſing; for Experience and beſt Authors have taught, 1.

                     <head>CHAP. I. Of the Nature, Differences, Cauſes, and Signs of Wounds.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Wound is a Solution of continuity in the ſoft parts of the Body, from a hard In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, cauſing an Abolition or Immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Action.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, 1. From the <hi>Form</hi>; ſome are long, others oblique; ſome are little, others great, ſome are deep, others ſuperficial. 2. From the <hi>wounded Part,</hi> as, the Head, Lungs, Heart, Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Guts, Nerve, Tendon, Vein or Muſcle; ſometimes the Skin is only penetrated, then 'tis a ſimple Wound; ſometimes a Part of the Fleſh is taken away,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52336:88"/>
and then 'tis call'd a compound or hollow Wound. 3. From the Cauſes, which ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be ſet down; ſometimes a wound happens to be poiſoned, and to have many Symptoms joined with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſes</hi> are five-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. All things that <hi>cut,</hi> as a Knife, Sword, Glaſs, 2. Al things that <hi>prick</hi>; as Needles, Arrows, Teeth. 3. Which <hi>perforate</hi>; as hot Iron, Bullets. 4. Which <hi>break</hi>; as a Fall, Stroke, or the carrying or lifting of any great Burdens. 5. All things which <hi>contuſe</hi>; as a Stone, Stick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] External Wounds are of themſelves manifeſt enough; but thoſe of the Internal parts, are not always ſo eaſily judged of; theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be known by Anatomy; 1. What is the ſituation of each part. 2. What the uſe. 3. The Symptoms are to be conſidered. 4. The Quality of thoſe things are to be noted, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ejected through the Wound: The other Signs you ſhall have in their proper places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſticks.</hi> [To know the Events of Wounds, eſpecially to predict which are Mortal, which not, is a thing abſolutely neceſſary for a Surgeon: For from this judgment oft-times depends the Life of unfortunate Man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A mortal Wound is that, which in the ſpace of few hours or days, of neceſſity cauſes Death, and cannot by any Art be cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For thoſe that in themſelves are curable, yet by reaſon of ill Symptoms, or through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect either of the Patient or Chirurgeon, do occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Death, ought not to be accounted mortal Wounds: Incurable Wounds themſelves are not to be call'd Mortal, if they are not the cauſe of Death
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52336:88"/>
ſuddenly to the Patient; but that he not only lives many weeks, but oftentimes many years after.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Among the Wounds that are Mortal, are to be accounted the Wounds of the Brain, but not all of them; for Experience hath taught us, that part of the Brain hath been taken forth, and the Life preſerved, though the Underſtanding loſt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore thoſe Wounds of the Brain that be abſolutely mortal, are, 1. <hi>When beſides the Brains, a Nerve is alſo wounded.</hi> 2. <hi>When Blood, or ſome other Humor obſtructs the beginning of the Nerves:</hi> 3. <hi>When after a few days the concrete and putrified Blood produceth a Fever,</hi> Delirium, <hi>and Death it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By concreted Blood, I underſtand not that which lies between the <hi>Dura-Mater</hi> and the Skull; for that is to be taken forth by the Trepan, and the Patient this way may be preſerved; but that which is included between the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or between the <hi>Pia</hi> and the Brain: Although ſometimes, that which is detained between both Membranes, by the dividing of the <hi>Dura,</hi> may be taken forth, and ſo the Patient preſerved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Wounds of the Spinal Marrow are alſo mortal, which happens in the Neck, or nearer to the Head; but thoſe which happen lower, as about the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> are of leſſer danger.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Wounds of the Lungs are mortal, if great and deep, where the great Veſſels, or the Branches of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> are hurt: Where the Veſſels are divided, there follows a great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Blood; where the Branches of the <hi>Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Arteria,</hi> the Breath comes forth more through the Wound than the Mouth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Wounds of the heart are always mortal;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52336:89"/>
for though one or two wounded in the heart, have lived, two, three, or four days, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found yet, that ever any eſcaped.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Wound of the Wind-pipe may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if the Membranes only behind, to which the Cartilaginous Rings are join'd, be hurt; but if the Rings themſelves are wounded, there's no cure to be expected; yet ſometimes thoſe wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lingering Death; ſo that I have ſeen on ſo wounded, live Eighteen weeks before he died.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Wounds of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> thoſe that are inflicted in the fleſhy Part of it, are curable; but thoſe that are in the Nervous Part, though theſe always occaſion not ſudden Death, yet 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ever to cure them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Wounds of the <hi>Stomach</hi> are ſometimes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; thoſe chiefly being mortal, that happen in the upper Orifice, or in Nerves that are diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over the Stomach.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Wounds of the <hi>Small Guts</hi> are ſeldom cured, but the <hi>Wounds</hi> of the <hi>Great Guts</hi> much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, eſpecially if they are not great.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Wounds of the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> are mortal, where the Veſſels themſelves are wounded; where not, they may be cured.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Wounds of the <hi>Kidneys</hi> are not mortal; if the Wound penetrate into the Cavity it ſelf, for the moſt part an Ulcer follows, which conſumes the whole Kidney, yet the Patient may continue many years: If the <hi>Parachyma,</hi> only be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſometimes, through difficulty, it may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Wounds of the <hi>Bladder</hi> are ſeldom ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, but that for the moſt part there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Fiſtula; but thoſe that are made at the neck of the bladder, are daily cured.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:52336:89"/>12. Wounds of the great <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> are often mortal; but every Surgeon underſtands not rightly to bind up ſuch Wounds; therefore the cauſe of death is not always to be caſt upon the guilty.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Wounds of the <hi>great Nerves</hi> are for the moſt part incurable, and ſometimes mortal.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Wounds from <hi>poiſoned Inſtruments</hi> or <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> generally are mortal.</p>
                     <p>Wounds of Nerves, Veins, Tendons and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, are more difficultly, and longer of Cure, than thoſe of the fleſhy parts.</p>
                     <p>A Wound from a pricking Inſtrument, is of leſs danger, than from a bruiſing.</p>
                     <p>A Nerve, Vein or Artery, if wholly divided, are leſs dangerous, than if they were but in part.</p>
                     <p>A great Inflamation coming upon a great Wound, is of no great danger, except it continue too long; but a great Inflamation falling upon a little Wound, is an ill ſign.</p>
                     <p>The Inflamation for the moſt part vaniſheth by the fifth day; therefore if the Wound then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear white, livid or black, 'tis not void of danger.</p>
                     <p>A Fever, Vomiting and Convulſion, are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but a Fever and Vomiting of leſs danger than a Convulſion.</p>

                     <p>CHirurgery removes the impediments of Cure, but Nature her ſelf cures the Diſeaſe; which it will ſcarce effect, where the Native heat is weak, or the Blood vitiated; or where it flows in too great or too little quantity to the Wound: in flowing in too great quantity, it produceth an Inflammation, Pain, Putrefaction, and many other Symptoms; where in too little quantity, the Wound is robbed of its Natural Balſam, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſolidate it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The natural ſtrength and native heat is preſerved</hi> by a convenient Diet, fitted to the temperament of Mans body in general, and in particular, to the Part affected. Of the Diet of the Sanguine,

                     </p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Care is to be had of the Blood,</hi> ſeeing it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords aſſiſtance to the matter, and ſerves to unite the Wound. <hi>Where it is vitiated,</hi> it requires purging: But <hi>if it flow in too great quantity,</hi> Intercipients, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellents, Revellents and Derivation muſt be us'd.</p>

                     <p>Then the Cure is to be perfected by External Medicines; which ſhall be declared in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter, when we ſpeak of the removal of the Symptoms, and the Cure of Wounds themſelves.</p>

Ligatures occaſion a <hi>Gangrene</hi>; the ſureſt way therefore in my opinion, is an actual Cautery; the leſſer Veſſels may and will cloſe, Some cloſe the Wound of the Veſſels with their Fingers, and ſo hold them there while the Blood is coagulated, and the Flux ſtopt; but this Operation ſeldom ſucceeds; beſides the long holding of the Finger in the Wound is hurtful.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let the Wound together with the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels be forthwith clos'd by the Fingers, but if you cannot come to do this, outwardly make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon the Veſſel; which done, wipe away the Blood with a Spunge, then ſprinkle ſome reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Powder; but not over the whole Wound (which is uſed to be done by the ignorant) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Veſſels; then bind up the Wound, continuing the uſe of the Medicines ſtopping Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, while there appears no longer any Blood; not neglecting in the mean time, Generals, <hi>viz.</hi> Scarification and Bleeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THe Lips of the Wound are joined together, either by Ligature or Stitching. <hi>Ligature</hi> is convenient in Wounds made according to the length of the Member, and not deep; let the Bandage be neither too hard, nor too looſe, and of that breadth that it may take in the whole

Wound. If it be a long Wound, the Rowler muſt be three Fingers broad, and laying the midſt of it upon the Wound, rowl one part upward, and the other downward; which muſt neither be too looſe, for then it will not keep the Lips of the Wound together; nor too ſtraight, leſt it cauſe an Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: In the Winter the Rowlers muſt be of greater length than in the Summer: In great Wounds, beſides Rowlers, the Surgeon ſtands in need of Boulſters.</p>

                     <p>Where Ligature is not ſufficient, and a Stitch with a Needle not convenient, the ſticking Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is very neceſſary; for ſo firmly doth this Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter adhere to the Wound, that neither the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter flowing out of the Wound, nor the Blood, nor any other moiſture looſens it.

By conſidering <hi>the wounded place,</hi> and by Anatomy, which teacheth in what Members the Nerves are inſerted; but the Tendons ſeeing they terminate near the Joynts, the Hands and Feet having many; if a Wound ſhould be inflicted in theſe parts, who would not fear them to be ſo hurt, eſpecially if it be with a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe

                     <p>Moreover it is to be obſerved, whether the Nerve or Tendon lies bare or not; if bare, warm Medicines are convenient; but if <hi>covered,</hi> hotter Medicines are required; in the mean time, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and Bleeding are not to be neglected.</p>

                     <p>Here firſt the Bullet, and any thing elſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies it, is to be drawn forth, leſt pain and inflamation coming upon it, may hinder; and care is to be had, that neither of them increaſe; and the contuſed Part, by the following Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be brought to ſuppuration.</p>
                     <p>Take Oyl of white Lillies, of Violets, of each two pints; two Puppies newly whelp'd; boil them till their Bones be almoſt diſſolv'd; then add Oyl of Earth-worms, a pint; and boil them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; ſtrain them, and add of Venice-Turpentine,

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52336:99"/>
ſometimes by mad Beaſts, as Dogs, Wolves, which hurt more by their venomous quality, than by wounding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> are, vehement pain, a livid Colour ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly becoming black; Symptoms more grievous than for the quality of the Wound; a Heat over the whole Body; Trembling, <hi>Delirium,</hi> Fainting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure</hi> conſiſts chiefly in this, that <hi>the Venom be drawn</hi> forth by Cupping glaſſes, attractive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, Scarifications, or, which is ſafeſt, by an actual Cautery; but then it muſt not be in a Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Part, the Eſcar to be forthwith removed, and the Wound to be cured by degrees. Inwardly <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks</hi> and <hi>Cordials</hi> profit. Bleeding and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hurt.</p>

                        <p>In Wounds of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> you muſt abſtain from all Unctious things. The ſound Eye is to be bound as well as the whole. The Head muſt be placed upright; if there be a <hi>Flux of Blood,</hi> the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things are convenient.</p>
                        <p>The Blood of Turtles, Pigeons, Hens, Mucilage, of the ſeeds of Fleawort, of Quinces, Tragacanth, Bloodſtone, Ceruſe, Tutty, Frankincenſe, Aloes; the white of an Egg, Water of Roſes, and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Decoction of Balauſtians, Red Roſes, Galls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

ſelf, all the Tunicles being divided, the Wound of the Abdomen ought to be united by a Stitch, a little Orifice being left, through which a Tent is to be put, which muſt not enter the Wound of the Stomach, but only outwardly touch it; let it be armed with this, or the like.</p>

                        <p>Wounds of the <hi>Small-Guts,</hi> ſometimes, though ſeldom, may be cured (this I can prove by a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Example.) Thoſe of the <hi>Great-Guts</hi> are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Where the <hi>Small-Guts</hi> are hurt, the Chyle, and ſometimes the Meat &amp; Drink, comes forth through the Wound; there is great pain, with a Fever and Nauſeouſneſs.

                        <p>Wounds of the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> require bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if the Belly be bound, Cliſters are daily to be injected; to the Wound it ſelf are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Aſtringent and Drying Medicines.</p>

                        <hi>AN Ulcer is a Solution of continuity with Diminution of Magnitude in the ſoft Parts, from a Corroding Matter.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, .1. From the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Ulcer</hi>; ſo 'tis great, little; long, ſhort; broad, narrow; right, tranſverſe; equal, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; deep, ſuperficial. 2. From the <hi>Part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; which ſometimes is the Skin and Fleſh only, ſometimes the Tendons; Nerves and Veſſels that carry the Blood. 3. From the Cauſes; which ſhall be preſently ſpoken of. 4. From the Symptoms; ſo 'tis painful, itching, obſtinate, verminous, carious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:52336:103"/>
                        <hi>Cauſe is a ſharp</hi> and corroſive Humor, and that is twofold. 1. <hi>Internal,</hi> as Choler, Melancholy, Serum, Salt, Phlegm, and other Malignant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. 2. <hi>External,</hi> as Burning and Corroſive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: the Sweat of Man infected with the Itch, Leproſie or Pox.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſtick.</hi>] By how much deeper the Ulcer is, ſo much the longer 'tis in Curing. Ulcers in Parts that are ſubject to much Humidity, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly cured. If an Ulcer cannot be cured in a long time, or when Cicatriz'd, breaks out again, the Cauſe is, the Bone being foul under it. Ulcers near to the Nerves, Veins or Tendons are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. In Cacochimick Bodies, their Cure is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. If the Matter which comes from them be good, it gives hope of an eaſie Cure. Good Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of a middle conſiſtence between thin and thick, white, light, equal, and not at all ſtinking. That which is ill, is thin and fluid, pale, livid, and of ill ſmell. Old and inveterate Ulcers are not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without danger, except the Body be well pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and a good order of Diet obſerved, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome Diſeaſes will enſue.</p>

                        <hi>Signs</hi> of Corruptions are many: Where the Bone lies open to the ſight, at firſt it appears of the colour of fat, then yellow, afterwards black and unequal; but where it cannot be ſeen, Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may judge that there it is a Corruption. 1. If a Fiſtula preceded, or the Ulcer hath been of long continuance. 2. If the Ulcer being skinn'd break out again. 3. If the fleſh above it becomes looſe, ſpungy, pale or livid. 4. If with the Probe you find no reſiſtance, but an Inequality. 5. If the Matter be much, thin and ſtinking.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Fiſtula is a long, narrow hollowneſs, or a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newous Ulcer, narrow and callous, not eaſily receiving Cure; for the moſt part, taking its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from an Abſceſs.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Difference,</hi> are <hi>ſtraight, oblique, ſimple, manifold,</hi> that is, having many hollowneſses; ſome going to the Bone, ſome to the Veins, Tendons, or Nerves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] The edges of this Ulcer are white, hard, without pain, or but little; ſometimes moiſt, but commonly dry: Outwardly the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity may be perceived in one place or other by preſſing the Part; in which alſo ſometimes there is a noiſe perceived, and the Matter now in leſſer quantity, otherwhiles in greater, is <hi>preſt</hi> out through the Orifice of the Fiſtula: By a Probe we can ſearch the Cavity of a ſtraight Fiſtula; but in an oblique, we uſe a Wax-Candle inſtead of a Probe. That is more convenient when the Fiſtula pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates to the Bone; this, when it is in the fleſhy and ſenſible parts: <hi>If the Fiſtula remains only in the fleſhy parts,</hi> that which is touched by the Probe, is ſoft, and the Matter that comes out, is white, equal, and in great quantity. <hi>If it extend to the Nerve,</hi> there is great pain in ſearching it to the bottom of the hollowneſs, and the Matter is fat and oyly, but is leſs in quantity, and the action of that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which the Nerve goes to, is rendred very
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52336:106"/>
uneaſie: <hi>If it paſſeth to the Bone,</hi> that which is touched by the Probe, is hard, not yielding, and painful, where the <hi>Perioſtium</hi> is not conſumed; The Bone, is foul, is rough, and ſeems unequal to the touch, the Matter is black, ſtinking and very thin: If the Cavity <hi>joins to a Vein,</hi> the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is like dregs, but reder and thicker, where the Vein is eroded: <hi>If it penetrates the Arteries,</hi> that which comes forth, is thin and ſhining, and comes forth with a leaping.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prognoſtick.</hi>] All Fiſtulas are of hard Cure; ſome incurable, others that ought not to be cured; to wit, thoſe by which the ſuperfluous Humors have for long time been vented.</p>
                     <p>A recent Fiſtula, and not deep, in a young bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and otherwiſe ſound is eaſily cured; but an old deep Fiſtula, having many Sinew's in an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, emaciated, cachochimick Body, is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe are alſo difficultly cured, yea, for the moſt part incurable, which touch the Tendons, Nerves, Veins, Arteries, Bones, and thoſe that are in the joints, Vertebra's, Cavity of the Breaſt, and lower Belly, the Womb, Bladder, or Guts.</p>
                     <p>Fiſtulas are wont to come in thoſe places, where Nature is accuſtomed to diſcharge her ſelf of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated Humors, to wit, in the Abdomen, Groins, Buttocks, Fundament, Cod and <hi>Perinaeum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where the edges are not very hard, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſoft and mattery, they do promiſe ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Cure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure</hi> of Fiſtulas are twoſold, one Real, and the other Palliative; by this the Fiſtula is dried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and skinned without; the hollowneſs never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs remaining, commonly continuing ſome

little while cloſed, but eaſily breaks forth again, except by a good Diet, often Purging and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it be perfectly cured: The true Cure is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this manner; good <hi>Diet, Purging, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Wound-Drinks</hi> effect here very much; but the <hi>Haemorrhoids flowing</hi> more. <hi>Natural Baths</hi> do oftentimes cure the greateſt Fiſtula's; in defect of them, may be prepared <hi>Artificial,</hi> of Brimſtone, Alom, Salt and Tartar, boil'd in Water; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let the Fiſtula be dreſt according to Art: Externally, the Part is to be <hi>corroborated, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor contained in the Sinus to be dried</hi>; but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Calloſity of the edges is to be taken away</hi>; therefore are Medicines for this purpoſe to be us'd; by whoſe help many Fiſtulas have been cured: but theſe not being ſufficient, an <hi>actual Cautery</hi> is to be applied, having firſt divided the edges; for which purpoſe the <hi>Syringotomon</hi> of <hi>Fabritius Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> is a moſt uſeful Inſtrument.</p>

If a hairy part be burnt, it remains bald; never hair grows there again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] The chief care muſt be <hi>to draw out the fire,</hi> by which in a light burning you preſerve from Bliſters and Ulcers; in a great one, you free from all danger; therefore what Medicine ſoever is at hand, is preſently to be uſed; let the hurt Part be held to the Fire, and fomented with warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Ink, Lye; or let there be applied Soot, or an Onion beaten with Salt, or any the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                           <hi>Ulcers of the Noſe</hi> moſt commonly yield an ill Scent, whence they are called <hi>Ozaenae.

                        <p>Take Lime-water, three ounces; Plantain, two ounces; white Troches of <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> a dram; Mix them for an Injection, to be uſed twice or thrice every day.</p>
                        <p>Lime water in this place, is nothing elſe than common-water wherein quick Lime hath been quencht: have a care of making it too ſtrong.</p>

                        <p>Anoint a Wax-Candle with this Ointment, and put it into the Urinary paſſage, renewing it twice or thrice a day, until there is an abſolute Mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

                  <p>AS <hi>Chirurgery</hi> is a of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> that ought not to be ſeparated from it; ſo alſo let not any imagine to himſelf, that he can deſerve the name of an Experienced <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> except he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſome part of it, eſpecially <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> the only Foundation of <hi>Chirurgery.</hi> But ſeeing that the ſtudy of ſome moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Anatomiſts,</hi> hath found out many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things in this happy Age, altogether unknown to the <hi>Ancients</hi> (though ſome foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly affirm the contrary, with great pains, aſcribing thoſe things to them, which they never ſo much as dream'd of) which indeed are not to be accounted of, as ingenious ſubtleties; but as the Fundamental Rules
<pb facs="tcp:52336:114"/>
and Cynoſure to thoſe that Navigate through the vaſt Ocean of this Art. It is every ones part to labour in it, that it may be perfected, and every day more and more illuſtrated; which may at length be brought to paſs, if with the greater Pains, <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Curioſity,</hi> we enquire into the unknown <hi>Regions</hi> and <hi>Tracts</hi> of the <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> and not given to ſloth, plough our Ground with other Mens Oxen, only truſting on the Authority of the Ancients, which the Learned wiſely call <hi>Aſinorum Pontem.</hi> As for me, I have ventured to introduce ſome new <hi>Opinions;</hi> becauſe that I deemed them in the nature of things, to exceed thee and me, and all in Antiquity. If thou enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt into it with the ſame labour, perchance thou mayeſt embrace the ſame <hi>Opinions</hi>: That of the <hi>Circulation of the Blood</hi> is now ſpread over all <hi>Europe;</hi> yea, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Profeſſors</hi> in the Illuſtrious <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,</hi> do all with one voice approve it; the <hi>Salivous paſſages</hi> and <hi>Limphaducts,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Lacteal</hi> Veſſels, both the greater and leſſer, may ſo plainly be demonſtrated, that they may be perceived as it were with one Eye. My own proper and peculiar <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions</hi> I have confirmed with Reaſons, which I ſuppoſe are agreeable to our Art: In the reſt, if thou findeſt any thing new,
<pb facs="tcp:52336:114"/>
it is nothing but what can be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Diſſection. What others have writ at another time, pleaſeth us alſo; for <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor ought not to change the parts of the Body; nevertheleſs the <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of my <hi>Genius</hi> is ſo pregnant, that I hope it will free thee from great pains and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt I thought it convenient largely to diſcourſe of the ſimple Parts, their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, that thou mighteſt not be neceſſitated to repeat in following the ſame thing a hundred times.</p>
                  <p>To this end I have retained the Terms of our Art, uſed by the Ancient Latine Writers.</p>
                  <p>Then I expound the elaborating the <hi>Blood,</hi> which properly is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and which the Wits of the Learned have long and much wreſted: <hi>O foeliciſſimum qui metam proximè atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all the parts of the Head, Breaſt, Abdomen and Joynts, I have ſo deſcribed, having not at all ſeparated them, that thou mighteſt not be forced to ſeek one here, and another there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:52336:115"/>But that this knowledge might become the more profitable, I have ſhewn the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes of it in <hi>Chirurgery,</hi> which I hope you will well apply, and endeavour with me, as much as poſſible, to perfect this Imperfection.</p>

                        <p>Seeing 'tis very neceſſary, even at firſt ſight, that thou ſhouldſt know the nature and temperaments of Men, becauſe they give the Rules of what is to be done in the curing of each Diſeaſe, we have thought it convenient in the very beginning of this Treatiſe, to deſcribe their Signs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Sanguine</hi> abound with Hair, but lank and yellowiſh; in proceſs of time declining into black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, <hi>handſom, red cheek'd, freſhy, ſtrong:</hi> When young, addicted to <hi>Venery,</hi> not enduring <hi>

                        <p>They bear <hi>Bleeding,</hi> provided it be at a fitting
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52336:116"/>
time, and in a convenient quantity; otherwiſe they eaſily fall into a Dropſie. Strong <hi>Purges,</hi> to wit, <hi>Euphorbium, Scammony, Colloquintida,</hi> and thoſe that are compounded of them, they cannot bear; though <hi>gentle Medicines, eaſily</hi>; as <hi>Cream of Tartar, Manna, Tamarinds, Pruines, Syrup of Roſes with Senna, Syrup of Succory with Rhubarb, Pulp of Caſſia, Electuaries of Diacatholicum Lenitive,</hi> &amp;c. As they eaſily fall into a Diſeaſe, ſo they quickly again recover.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cholerick</hi> have black <hi>Hair,</hi> and for the moſt part curled; <hi>lean</hi> but very <hi>ſtrong: Coition</hi> profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; they are <hi>judicious,</hi> and <hi>ſwift</hi> in action, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>idleneſs</hi>; they truſt neither the words or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of Men; ſoon ſubject to Laughter, if the thing require it, otherwiſe <hi>grave</hi>: When <hi>irritated,</hi> addicted to ſtrike; more inclined to <hi>Drink</hi> and <hi>Watching,</hi> than to <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Sleep</hi>; their dreams are of Fire, Thunder, Quarrels, Battels. <hi>Pulſe ſtrong, quick</hi> and <hi>great: Urine</hi> high-coloured, as alſo their <hi>Excrements.</hi>

                           <hi>Choler</hi> requires not <hi>Bleeding,</hi> yet permits it, if there be a quantity of Blood joined with it; but it muſt neither be exceſſive, nor oftner repeated, than juſt neceſſity requires, leſt the Choler ſhews its Malignity; gentle <hi>Purges</hi> relieve it, but ſtrong irritate it; it produceth <hi>vehement and dangerous Diſeaſes,</hi> and for the moſt part ſhort.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. II. Of the Parts in general·</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Part (properly</hi> ſo call'd) <hi>is a firm, limited Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is nouriſhed by other living Parts but doth not nouriſh; having a peculiar uſe and operation for the advantage of the whole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is <hi>diſtinguiſhed,</hi> 1. Into the <hi>Principal Parts,</hi> or or thoſe <hi>not ſo: Principal</hi> are thoſe that perform ſome Noble Operation common to the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as the Heart, Liver, Brain, Teſticles: <hi>Thoſe not ſo,</hi> are thoſe that ſerve the Principal, and whence they are call'd their Servants, as the Eye, Ear, Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This diſtinction pleaſed ſome Anatomiſts many years ſince, whom I much eſteem; yet not me: For if the Liver and Heart are numbred amongſt the Principal Parts becauſe they elaborate the Blood for the advantage of the whole Body, why is not the Tongue accounted a Principal Part alſo? which is not only an Inſtrument of Speech, by which we are diſtinguiſhed from Beaſts, but alſo of Taſtes, by whoſe aſſiſtance we chuſe thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments which are beſt; which if wanting, how the Heart and Liver could ſupply the Body with good Nutriment, I ſee not. The Brain governs all, but how I beſeech you? If the Inteſtines did not perform their Orifice aright, what would it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? How ſhould we be eſteem'd, if, like an Oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, we ſhould want Eyes and Ears? How deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the Feet and Hands, yet in how many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52336:118"/>
do they ſerve? For thoſe not ſtirring, both Chilification would be impaired, and the Blood and the Spirits rendred thicker, and the Brain made unfit for all actions: In how ſhort a time would the <hi>Limpha</hi> of our Body be corrupted, if, beſides its own motion, it was not alſo moved with the whole Body? All things in our Body are joyned together as in a Clock, one cannot be without the other; neither is the moſt deſpicable Wheel leſs neceſſary than the Hand of the Clock itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it cannot be accounted a Clock.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Into <hi>ſimilar</hi> Parts and <hi>diſſimilar</hi>: A <hi>ſimilar,</hi> which divided into many parts, yet, whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle parts be of the ſame Nature with the whole.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Diſſimilar</hi> are made up of more or leſs <hi>ſimilars,</hi> as the Hand, Fingers, Feet.</p>
                     <p>There are <hi>ten Similars</hi> found in the Body; a Bone, Cartilage, Ligament, Membrane, Fibre, Nerve, Vein, Artery, Fleſh, Skin; the eight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are made of Seed; Fleſh, of Blood alone, the Skin of both.</p>
                     <p>This Diviſion is ſubject to greater difficulties than the former; but ſeeing it is not convenient to reject it, without the greateſt confuſion in the practice of Phyſick, let us conſider the thing it ſelf, committing the Diſputes concerning the Name, to the Schools.</p>
                     <div type="section">

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>A Principal Part being affected</hi> or <hi>wounded,</hi> renders the whole Cure dangerous: therefore <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> are not to be given here, but with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, leſt the ſudden alteration be rather aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to thee, than to the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Wounds of the <hi>ſimilar</hi> Parts are leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52336:118"/>
than of the <hi>diſſimilar</hi>; yea, oftentimes they are ſooner cured by ſimple Medicines, than by compound; the conſent of the Parts, by reaſon of the Vital and Animal Spirits, is ſo great, that ſcarce a Joint of the Finger being hurt, can be cured, without regard had to the whole Body. In deed by the aſſiſtance of the Ligaments, Tendons, Membranes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Parts are ſo ſtraightly knit together, and ſo abound with Sanguinary Veſſels, that oftentimes upon the ſlighteſt hurt, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Symptoms enſue, if you order not every thing aright.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Bone is a Similar Part, cold and dry, compoſed of Seed, that it might afford ſtrength to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and help its motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Naturally, 1. It is hard. 2. Covered with a Membrane. 3. White, with ſome Redneſs, 4. Hollow, or Spungy. 5. About the Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties covered with a Cartilage. 6. Smooth. 7. Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened with a fat Humor.</p>
                     <p>It is <hi>nouriſhed</hi> by Blood brought from the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (every where ſo ſmall, excepting the lower Jaw, that Writers of great eſteem have denied them to the Bones) but eſpecially contained in the Marrow.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Marrow</hi> is inveſted with a Membrane, it ſelf is altogether inſenſible; in the Cavities of great Bones, 'tis White mixed with Red; in the

leſſer, White; in the Spungy Bones, ſoft and juicy</p>
                     <p>Its <hi>Senſe</hi> it borrows from the covering Tunicle for the moſt curious Obſerver never ſaw Nerves.</p>
                     <p>The Bones are <hi>joined together,</hi> partly for the greater firmneſs, partly for the better Motion.</p>
                     <p>That Conjunction which is for their firmneſs, is called <hi>Symphyſis,</hi> and is ſix-fold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Suture,</hi> as in the Bones of the Skull.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Harmony,</hi> whigh is by a right or oblique Line, as in the upper Jaw.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Gomphoſis,</hi> as the Teeth in the Jaws.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Sinchondroſis,</hi> which is by an interpoſing Cartilage, as in the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> or the <hi>Sternum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Syneuroſis,</hi> which is by the aſſiſtance of a Ligament, as the Thigh-Bone with the Hips.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>That Conjunction which is for Motion, is call'd Articulation, and is twofold.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Diarthroſis,</hi> to wit, a looſe Articulation: And 2. <hi>Synarthroſis,</hi> to wit, a ſtraighter Articulation.</p>
                     <p>And both is performed by three manner of ways. 1. <hi>Enarthroſis,</hi> When the Cavity receiving the Bone is great, and the proceſs of the Bone to be received alſo great, as in the joining of the Thigh-bone with the Hips.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Arthrodia.</hi> When the Cavity is ſuperficial, and the Proceſs little, as in the hinder part of the Head, with the firſt Vertebra of the Neck.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Gynglymus,</hi> When one Bone takes into its Cavity the proceſs of another, and contrariwiſe the other Bone receives into its Cavity the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the former; as the Bone of the Thigh with the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and the Shoulder-bone, the <hi>Ulna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="209" facs="tcp:52336:119"/>The <hi>number</hi> of Bones is greater in Children than in adult People; for by years, many of them ſo grow together, as that they cannot be ſeparated any more; alſo their number is much leſſened, when conſideration of the Proceſſes and ſmall Bones is not had; from hence it is that ſome reckon 360. ſome, 304, others, 249,</p>

                        <p>The Bones are ſubject to many Diſeaſes. <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> and <hi>Diſlocations</hi> are already diſcourſed of, as alſo <hi>Putrefaction</hi>: But ſeeing there may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways produced, we will declare thoſe which are chiefly worth our conſideration.</p>
                        <p>Preternatural Humors, by what cauſe ſoever, either General or Particular, penetrating the Bone, ſometimes produce an <hi>Ulcerous Excreſcency with moiſtneſs of the Bone</hi>; ſometimes a <hi>Cancer of the Bone,</hi> to wit, <hi>Spina Ventoſa,</hi> effects neceſſary to be diſtinguiſhed; which becauſe no Phyſician hath made it his buſineſs to deſcribe, I will impart that which Reaſon and Experience hath taught us.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe of an <hi>Ulcerous Excreſcency with the Humidity of the Bone</hi> (which effect is called by the <hi>Dutch, een Beenſuyger</hi>) is preternatural Phlegm, depriving the Bone of its temper and hardneſs; the fleſh cannot be ſaid from this ſoft foundation to keep alſo its Natural ſtate; but its nouriſhment paſſeth into ſoft ſpongy fleſh, which by degrees encreaſeth, and at length cauſeth an Ulcer; from
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52336:121"/>
whence the Tendons Ligaments, and Nerves are corrupted, and the whole Member ſubject to danger.</p>
                        <p>In this caſe you muſt not flatter your ſelf, that Medicines can effect any thing before you come to the bottom, that is, the Bone it ſelf: And the Bone being made ſound, the Ulcer will be cured, and the fleſh return unto its natural Conſtitution. It is therefore neceſſary to make Inciſion, even down to the Bone it ſelf, and if there be a great excreſcency, <hi>extirpate it</hi>; and if it be obſerved to riſe again, apply an <hi>actual Cautery,</hi> always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration being had of the Bone.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Remedies proper</hi> againſt Putrefaction of the Bones, are already, both by us and others, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently deſcribed. To take away the <hi>Excreſcency</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Oyl of Vitriol, Oyl of Antimony, Spirit of Vitriol, <hi>Ung. Aegyptiacum, Fuſcum</hi> of <hi>Felix Wurtz,</hi> are very good; and this Powder is excellent.</p>
                        <p>Take the Reſtaurative Powder, an ounce; white Vitriol, a dram; prepared Arſenick, two drams: Mix them.</p>
                        <p>Sprinkle it upon the proud Fleſh, laying over it a drying Plaiſter, and it will make a thick Eſcar, without great pain, which may be taken off the next day.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of a <hi>Cancer</hi> of the <hi>Bone</hi> (by the <hi>Dutch</hi> named <hi>een Beenvreeter</hi>) is a ſharp Humor, firſt corroding the Bone, then making its way through the <hi>Perioſtium</hi>; then follows an Ulcer of the Fleſh and Skin, incurable, before the Bone be made ſound; its Orifice is very little, the edges are pale, the Matter that flows forth, is thin, the Fleſh ſoft, and ſomewhat ſwell'd, at leaſt (as we have
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52336:121"/>
ſpoken in an <hi>Ulcerous Excreſcency</hi>) encreaſeth of its own accord.</p>
                        <p>Here alſo is Inciſion neceſſary, made according to the length of the Part, to the Bone it ſelf; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with muſt be applyed thoſe things that <hi>correct Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction,</hi> to wit, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> Spirit of Vitriol, mixt with Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp;e.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have not only once experienc'd the Powder of Turpentine, hardned by boiling, to be of great virtue, mixt with <hi>Ung. Fuſcum</hi> of <hi>Felix Wurtz,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi>; an <hi>actual Cautery</hi> is very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: The Cure alſo will be accelerated, if inſtead of Tents made of Lint, you uſe Elder-pitch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this inbibes the ſharp and thin Humors, by which the Action of Nature is promoted.</p>
                        <p>Seeing that for the moſt part theſe Diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the diſtemperature of the whole Maſs of Blood, and when one Cancer is almoſt cured, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother appears in ſome other place, therefore 'tis highly neceſſary to have regard to the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For which purpoſe, the following, or the like Medicines may be taken.</p>
                        <p>Take Roots of Comfry the great, Oſmund Royal, <hi>China, Sarſaparella,</hi> of each an ounce; Guaiacum Bark, two ounces; Rhubarb, ſix drams; Senna, ten drams; Agarick, ſix drams; Cloves a dram; Cinamon, two drams: Infuſe them 24 hours in a ſufficient quantity of Barley water, then boil them with a gentle fire, and to two quarts of the ſtrained Liquor, add of Syrup of Comfrey of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> four ounces: Make it into an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeme.</p>
                        <p>Let the Patient, of a middle age, take three, four, or five ounces; it purgeth gently, forwards the Cure, and preſerves from further miſchiefs.</p>

                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p>Take Milk, ſix ounces; Yolk of an Egg; White-Sugar, three drams: Mingle them; let the Patient take often a ſpoonful or two.</p>

                        <p>I deem thoſe Anatomiſts to have committed a great Error, who have aſcribed this Malady to be an <hi>Inflamation of the Larinx</hi>; although I deny not, but that the Cartilages may be inflamed, and alſo corrupted; yet 'tis certain, that which they have ſet down, is not of the Cartilages, but of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Glandules, and of the fleſhy parts of the Jaws; for it would not be ſo frequently cured, becauſe an Inflamation and Corruption of the <hi>Larinx</hi> I always eſteemed a mortal Diſeaſe.</p>

                     <p>Of the laſt of which, a more convenient occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be offered to treat of in the following.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venae Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta</hi> take their beginning from the Liver. There are thoſe which would
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52336:126"/>
have them come from the heart, from a weak Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from unborn Embrio's. But where I find many Branches inſerted in the Liver, few or none in the Heart; yea, I have obſerved, that it hath not entred into the Heart it ſelf, but only to be joined to its right Auricle: I rather embrace the old Opinion, willingly granting thoſe honours to the Liver that I think belongs to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Roots of the Vena Cava and Porta were united by mutual Inoſculations,</hi> the old Anatomiſts perſwaded themſelves; but the curious Inquiſition of the Moderns hath both found out and clearly demonſtrated, that they mutually touch one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not ſo united, that the Blood can paſs out of one into the other; for the extremities of the foreſaid Veſſels, by means of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver, do ſo mutually conſent, that Milk or any liquid thing caſt into the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> with a Syringe, finds an eaſie paſſage into the <hi>Vena Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> without either an injury of the Veins or the Parenchyma. Concerning which, read <hi>Gliſſon. Anatom.</hi> of the Liver, <hi>pag.</hi> 272.</p>
                     <p>Veins have only one <hi>Tunicle</hi> with many <hi>Valves</hi> within, eſpecially in the external Joints.</p>
                     <p>They are <hi>nouriſhed</hi> with Blood from the <hi>little Arteries,</hi> not that contained within themſelves.</p>
                     <p>They are endowed with <hi>feeling,</hi> both from themſelves, and ſometimes from the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to receive the Blood not ſufficiently ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated from the Arteries, and return it to the Heart and Liver, there to be more perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted.</p>

                        <p>Chirurgeons were wont to tie a Bandage about the Neck; but ſeeing when it is hard bound, it is very troubleſome; it is better that the Ligature be made under the Arm-pits, which muſt be ſo ſtraight, that the Jugular Veins, and Carotide Artery may appear both by ſwelling and touch; then let the Arteries be compreſſed by the Thumb, a little below, where you intend to make the Inciſion; and being opened, (which muſt be done by a ſteddy and ſtrong hand) take forth as much Blood as is ſufficient; which done, ſtrew Aſtringent Powder upon the Wound; then put over it a double Linnen Cloth, with a Plate of Lead; then bind it up with a convenient Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and within five or ſix days ſpace, it will be perfectly well.</p>

                        <hi>THE Fleſh is a ſimilar, Bloody, Soft, Thick part, together with the Bones, to yield a ſtrengthening to the Body, and to cover the ſpermatick Parts.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Muſculous</hi> is ſoft, red, and is properly call'd fleſh, and for theſe many ages hath come under the name of Muſcles.</p>
                     <p>But yet a Muſcle is not a Similar Part, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of many others, to wit, Fibres, Tendons, Nerves, a Membrane, Veins, Arteries, that it might be a fitter inſtrument of voluntary motion, to which the Fibres, Tendons and Nerves do chiefly contribute.</p>
                     <p>It hath a Tendon in its begining and end, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times round, ſometimes broad, ſometimes but one, ſometimes double.</p>
                     <p>Its <hi>end</hi> is in that place where the Tendons are greater and more.</p>
                     <p>Its <hi>Head,</hi> or beginning, where the Nerve is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, the <hi>middle,</hi> where the fleſh ſwells out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> is, to promote voluntary motion, which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52336:134"/>
is <hi>performed</hi> after a three-fold manner.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the <hi>Contraction of the Muſcle</hi> is ſo, that the end comes to the beginning, and then its Antagoniſt is quiet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the <hi>Motion</hi> is <hi>Tonick,</hi> ſo that being contracted, it remains for ſome time in the ſame condition.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When it relaxeth, ſo that it is reſtored into its former ſeat and quiet, by its Antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Glandulous fleſh is white, thick and ſpungy,</hi> formed of ſeed (from whence it cannot properly be call'd fleſh) to this purpoſe ordained, 1. To prop up the Veſſels. 2. To receive the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humidities; whence they are called the <hi>Emu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories</hi> of the noble Parts.</p>
                     <p>Some Anatomiſts make ſtrange diverſities of them, but it will appear to any one that diligently enquires into all the Glandules, that they differ not ſo much in ſubſtance, as in their Uſe and Humor.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Viſcerous fleſh, or the Parenchemick is red, hard, convenient to prop the Veſſels, and to ſerve for many particular and various operations</hi>; this is the fleſh of the Lungs, Heart, Liver, Spleen, which ſhall be treated of in their places.</p>

                        <head>Chirurgical Conſiderations.</head>
                        <p>The Muſcles are ſubject to many Diſeaſes, very many of which are of ſo little conſequence, that they ſhall not be numbred here; ſome we have declared in another place: the following require conſideration, oftentimes wonderfully exerciſing the patience and diligence of the Chirurgeon.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. An <hi>Atrophy</hi> of the whole Body oftentimes comes from an Internal Cauſe: But if of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52336:134"/>
Hand, Arm, Foot, for the moſt part from an External Cauſe. Thus <hi>a Fracture, Luxation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion, Tumor, too hard Ligature,</hi> and the like, ſo vehemently compreſſing the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that it hinders the free paſſage of the Blood to the Parts, upon which happens an Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation; for where the Veſſels are wholly divided or ſtopt, ſo that the leaſt quantity of Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be carried to the Parts, there follows not a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the Part, but a Mortification; in this Caſe the External Cauſes muſt be removed: And care is to be taken that the Blood may again be carried to the Part: Here <hi>chafing</hi> the Part, and the uſe of <hi>Nettles</hi> (as many will) is good; the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts commend much <hi>Alumen Plumoſum</hi>; all hot Oyls likewiſe are here good; and this Oyntment is of excellent vertue.</p>
                        <p>Take freſh tops of Savin, Juniper, Lovage, of each two handfuls; Camomile Flowers, Juniper-berries, of each two handfuls; Oyl of Bayes, White-Lillies, of each twelve ounces; Hogs-greaſe, three ounces; Dogs-greaſe, an ounce and half; <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> two ounces; Boil them to the conſumption of the moiſture; then add to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd Liquor, Oyl of Spike, three drams; Juniper, a dram; Muſtard-ſeed in Powder, half a an ounce; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> Long-Pepper powdred, of each two draws; Yellow wax as much as is ſufficient to make it into an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Or,</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Pulvis Amianti,</hi> three drams; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> a dram and half;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:52336:135"/>
Caſtor, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> Oyl of Earth, of each two drams; Gum <hi>Ammoniacum,</hi> an ounce and half; <hi>Laudanum</hi> and Wax, as much as ſufficeth to make it into a Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The true reaſon of the generation of Wens, in my opinion, is this; the mouths of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries appointed to carry nouriſhment to the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſometimes are more opened than they ought to be, whether it be by Fall or Blow, or from an internal Cauſe, eſpecially in Plethorick People, and in Parts diſorderly moved, the native heat converts the extravaſated Blood into Fleſh: But ſeeing the Member requires not ſo great a quantity of nouriſhment, it increaſeth into a preternatural Swelling; and if this Blood be impure, Choler produceth Pain, Phlegm, Viſcouſneſs, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Cartilaginous hardneſs; and 'tis to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to theſe Humors, that this preternatural fleſh is more yellow, white or livid.</p>
                        <p>'Tis ſeldom included in a proper Tunicle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where Phlegm is its greateſt Cauſe, and then thoſe Tumors are generally in the Neck: The Veins grow big, according to the increaſe of the Tumor, ſo that under the Skin they appear as thick as ones Thumb.</p>
                        <p>'Tis not in it ſelf malignant, yet by ill applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be eaſily made ſo: Air is very hurtful, if the Tumor be expoſed to it.</p>
                        <p>For the moſt part the beſt Remedies are here uſed to little purpoſe; on the contrary, the Tumor more and more increaſing. You cannot promiſe any Cure, except you take it away by a Thred, Knife, or both.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning, the <hi>Medicines</hi> that are to be applied, ought to be very <hi>aſtringent</hi> and <hi>repelling,</hi>
                           <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52336:135"/>
the Part is gently to be rouled, having applied to it, either a Plate of Lead, or a Diachalcitheos Plaiſter, or of Frogs with Mercury, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                        <p>Take Pomegranate-rinds, Biſtort-roots, of each one dram; Scales of Iron, Quick-ſilver, Burnt-Lead, of each two drams; Bole-armenick, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Haematitis,</hi> of each a dram and half; Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Wax, as much as is ſufficient to make it into a Plaiſter according to Art.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, <hi>Purging, Bleeding, Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Leeches</hi> are not to be neglected. <hi>Sweating,</hi> alſo <hi>Watchings</hi> and <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> profit very much.</p>
                        <p>But if the Tumor yields not to theſe Remedies, but daily increaſeth, <hi>Suppuratives</hi> are to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if theſe within few days effect nothing, and the Tumor continuing in the ſame ſtate, an <hi>actual Cautery</hi> may be uſed; which, let not the contrary Opinions either of Chirurgeons or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by hinder; for by its uſe, the increaſe of the Tumor will be ſtayed for a long time; yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Diſeaſe will be wholly eradicated.</p>
                        <p>But if the Fleſh begins to repullulate again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation, the Surgeon ought not to defer to endeavour either by a <hi>Thred</hi> or <hi>Knife</hi> its extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; the <hi>Thred</hi> being ſmall and ſtrong, muſt be twice wound about the neck of the Tumor, and tied with a double knot, which muſt be ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſame day, and ſo every day until the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor be deprived of its colour, ſenſe and life, which is within ſeven or eight days; then 'tis to be taken off with a crooked Knife, which is very eaſie to perform, ſeeing neither any great pain or flux of Blood is to be feared: If the <hi>Thred</hi> be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52336:136"/>
wet in Mercurial or Arſenick-water, it haſtens the mortification of this Tumor: But in this Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Phlegmatick Body is required; for in other Bodies pain and inflamation do ſo much afflict the Patient, that 'tis ſeldom that the <hi>Thred</hi> in a ſhort time ſhould take them off; yet the Chirurgeon may to leſſen the Symptoms, and to cool, anoint with a Feather the part which the <hi>Thred</hi> toucheth, with white camphorated Ointment, of Roſes, or the like, continually putting the Patients in mind how that others bear it more quietly.</p>
                        <p>But if you deſign to uſe a <hi>Knife</hi> only, the whole Tumor muſt be endeavoured to be taken away, except you will conſume the remaining by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which is very rarely effected; beſides the Chirurgeon muſt have a Care that he divides not the greater Veſſels, leſt there follows a Flux of Blood not to be ſtopped.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Viſcerous Fleſh</hi> belongs rather to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians care, than the Chirurgeons.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Of the <hi>Glandulous Fleſh</hi> we have treated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in ſeveral places. In general 'tis to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1. That the <hi>Glandules</hi> are of a <hi>cold tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> therefore require hot Medicines, but very ill ſuffers cold. 2. The <hi>Tunicle inveſting them, being eroded or divided,</hi> the Skin cannot be conſolidated, before the whole Glandule, together with its Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, be conſumed with the Ulcer. 3. If <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> Medicines cure not the Ulcers of the <hi>Glandules,</hi> within the ſpace of few weeks, no hope remains of a ſound Cure, becauſe of the continual Flux of Humors: And this is the reaſon why we are for the moſt part compelled to take them away by Inciſion.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Fat, Nails and Hair.</head>
                     <p>IT hath been long diſputed, whether the Fat, Hair and Nails ought to be accounted Parts of the Body, or Excrements. I neither think them Excrements, nor Parts properly ſo call'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Not Excrements,</hi> for they are Bodies, enjoying with the reſt Life and Nouriſhment, but not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing others, and are of ſingular uſe for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They are not Parts properly ſo call'd,</hi> being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any certain bounds, and have no particular operation: Fat nouriſheth in Famine; the Hair and Nails, without injury to the whole, may be cut off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adeps,</hi> or <hi>Fat, is a ſimilar, ſoft, white, inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part, made to preſerve the Natural Heat, to help Chylification, to facilitate Motion, to moiſten the Parts, and to nouriſh the Body in Famine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hair is a ſimilar Part, produced by the worſt part of the Blood, covering ſome Parts, and in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner adorning them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis outwardly <hi>four-ſquare,</hi> inwardly <hi>hollow</hi>; the variety of <hi>Colour</hi> it owes to the Temperament &amp; Age of Men, to the Conſtitution of the Air or Country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Nail is a ſimilar part, ſprung alſo from the impureſt part of the Blood, flexible, hard, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fingers from external injuries, as alſo adorning them.</hi> Its Root is joyned to a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                        <p n="1">1. Blood wholly, or in part deſtitute of Fat, is not much to be commended; for its abundance conſtitutes fleſhy, its unctiouſneſs, fat Bodies, as where but little fat, lean; this fatneſs of the Blood diſperſed into the parts of the Body, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth into natural Fat more copiouſly in the cold parts, to wit, in the lower Belly, Breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than in the hot. Theſe Signs may confirm our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as often as they are required from the Blood, after the opening of a Vein; for the upper part of the Blood, which is erroneouſly taken by many, to be the Phlegm of the Body, and ſo the vitious part, oftentimes is the very beſt of it: This may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the Fire; for if it be fat, it will flame; if Phlegm, it uſeth to crackle; hence it comes to paſs, that the Fat, when it is any obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Cure of an external Diſeaſe, may be cut off without any pain, or other inconvenience.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Nails</hi> are oftentimes ſubject to <hi>clefts,</hi> to be <hi>rough,</hi> and of <hi>ill colour</hi>; the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is a vicious <hi>Humor,</hi> or ſome External Accident; theſe may be cured by the often paring of the ſuperfluities, and the applying the following Plaiſter.</p>

                           <hi>Blood</hi> ſometimes remains coagulated under the <hi>Nails,</hi> which may be diſcuſſed by this Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>Take Roots of Crow-foot, of <hi>Solomons</hi> Seal, red Mirrhe, of each a dram; Gum <hi>Sagapenum,</hi>

an ounce; Oyl of Nuts, a dram: Make it into a Plaiſter.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>falling</hi> off of the Nails, a <hi>Finger-ſtall</hi> may be prepared of Green Wax, <hi>Laudanum</hi> and <hi>Amoniacum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>ſhedding of the Hair</hi> is a frequent evil; the cauſes of it, are <hi>Burning Fevers, old Head-aches, the Leproſie,</hi> and <hi>the French Pox</hi>; and there is not to be expected any new in its room, before the Cauſe for ſome time hath been taken away; which being done, the following external Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations may be made uſe of.</p>
                        <p>Take Southern-wood, Maiden-hair, Mallows, Marjoram, of each one handful; Cummin, roots of Parſley, of Radiſhes, Storax Calamit, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, red Mirrhe, of each five drams; <hi>Euphorbium, Cantharides,</hi> of each a dram; Gum <hi>Laudanum,</hi> three ounces; Oyl of white-Lillies, an ounce; Roman Nettle-ſeeds, half an ounce: Infuſe them 36 hours in three quarts of fair Water, then diſtil them in <hi>Balneo Mariae.</hi>

                     <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Generation of the Blood, and its Circulation.</head>
                     <p>WE have hitherto treated of the Similar Parts, properly and improperly ſo call'd; from whom are the Diſſimilars compounded. The Blood ſerves to their Conſervation, as doth the Spirits to the Actions from thence proceeding; but how the Blood is generated in our Body, and how many Spirits are there found, is not as yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently underſtood by us. In this thing Writers differ among themſelves, ſo that the very Truth ſeems to lie hid in the profoundeſt darkneſs; yet the love and deſire of ſearching out the Truth exactly, gives me freedom to declare my Opinion, yet ſtill giving place to a better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sanguification</hi> I conceive to be performed after this manner: The harder Meat received in by the Mouth, chawed by the Teeth, and by the <hi>Spittle</hi> moiſtened, is in ſome manner prepared to be made Chyle.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Spittle,</hi> from whence it hath its beginning, no man as I know of, hath rightly demonſtrated: Thoſe that derived it from the Veins and Arteries, it is upon this reaſon, becauſe they communicate ſeveral Branches to the Maxillerary Glandules, through which the late invented <hi>Ductus Salivales</hi> paſs; and moreover, a Salivation raiſed by Art, ſeems to confirm this Opinion.</p>
                     <p>But how the Arteries and Nerves can ſeparate
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52336:140"/>
ſo great a quantity of <hi>Spittle,</hi> as we have often known to have been thrown forth in ſo ſhort a time, ſeems not poſſible to me, I do rather derive it from the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Limphaducts,</hi> which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to adhere to the Salivals, upon the following Reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As often as voluntary ſwallowing is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we obſerve the Spittle to aſcend as it were from the Stomach into the Mouth it ſelf, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Meat be moiſtened by Drink.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Tongue, Mouth and the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach have inwardly a common Tunicle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Meat in the Mouth, as in like manner in the Ventricle, ought to be mixt with Spittle.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It would be very troubleſome continually to drink in eating; for it is very eaſie for ſome time to keep the devoured Liquor in the Stomach, and then ſenſibly to communicate ſome part of it to the Mouth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Limphaducts are diſperſed through the whole Body, and they go both unto the Stomach and Tongue.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I judge no Humor to be thrown out of our Body, except by peculiar paſſages; and ſo for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reaſons, I think the Tears alſo to be ſhed though particular Channels, which a more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hand (whether mine or others) may ſometimes find out: Yea, the moſt Noble <hi>Lewis Bills,</hi> the great Anatomiſt, atteſts to have already diſcover'd them and promiſeth to demonſtrate them in the Body, and in Figures to the Favourers of Truth.</p>
                     <p>If you enquire of me of what nature <hi>Spittle</hi> is, I anſwer, that it is <hi>Salt</hi>; yet 'tis not always neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that this ſaltneſs be perceived by the Tongue, which thoſe that Underſtand the Nature
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52336:141"/>
of Artificial Salts, ſufficiently know: It is certain that there is ſome natural Salt in all Meats and Drinks; 'tis alſo certain, that Salt not only helps the commixing and concoction of the Meat, but alſo contributes much to the fermentation of the Humors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ductus Salivales,</hi> which we have now made mention of, have but one ſtrong <hi>Tunicle,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Ureters, but that they are leſſer.</p>
                     <p>Of each ſide <hi>one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They <hi>take their Original,</hi> endued with many Roots, from a certain great Glandule, lying under the Tendon of the <hi>Muſculus Digaſtricus,</hi> not far from the upper Part of the Jaw; then they run under the Tongue, above the great Nerve of our eighth Pare, to the more inward parts of the mouth, where, in the two ranine Glandules, near the bridle of the Tongue, they terminate; from whom being variouſly perforated, iſſues out the Spittle into the Mouth; of which, the enquiring Reader may more largely ſatisfie his curioſity, out of the Writings of <hi>Gliſſon</hi> and <hi>Van-Horn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Meat thus chewed by the Teeth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Mouth, through the <hi>Gullet,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of proper Muſcles, is carried into the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which that it may the better keep it, it preſently purſeth it ſelf together, ſo that the <hi>upper Orifice</hi> is cloſe ſhut, but the <hi>lower</hi> not ſo ſtraight, that though very lightly preſſed, may there find paſſage.</p>
                     <p>The Meat received by the Stomach, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened by Spittle, Drink, and its own humidity, forthwith by the heat of the Stomach, begins to be concocted; the <hi>Order</hi> is not obſerved here, which was in the eating of the Meat; yet in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52336:141"/>
I have obſerved the Meat to be diſpoſed in the ſame order, as it was devoured by the Animal that was diſſected; but afterwards the Stomack continually digeſting, firſt ſends away that Meat which is of eaſieſt Digeſtion, to the Guts, and it doth not detain it, whilſt the other is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, which Looſneſſes and Vomiting evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough declare, if you look into the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>The Meat being concocted, aſſumes a white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs like to Cream, and this is called <hi>Chile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chile</hi> out of the <hi>ſtomach through the Pylorus</hi> enters the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> in which paſſage there is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Periſtaltick motion: Out of this the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> ſuck what is uſeful to nouriſh the parts; and the unuſeful is caſt out through the Belly: The <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> conſiſt of one very thin Tunicle, but are endowed with ſeveral Valves, extended from the Liver towards the Glandules, they are diſtributed through all the Meſentery, and ſo are carried for the moſt part to the ſmall Guts, eſpecially the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junum</hi>; but yet the great Guts are not altogether deſtitute of them, that none of the Nutriment may be loſt.</p>
                     <p>From the Inteſtine, both theſe Veſſels and the Chile contain'd in them, go to the three <hi>Glandules of the Chile,</hi> the greateſt of which is in the middle of the Meſentery, called by <hi>Aſellius, Pancreas</hi>; the two leſſer are call'd the <hi>Lumbar Glandules,</hi> ſituate near the left Kidney.</p>
                     <p>Each of theſe <hi>Glandules</hi> ſend forth a Branch, which joining above the left Kidney, conſtitutes a Veſſel called <hi>Vena Lactea,</hi> about the bigneſs of a great quill.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>great Lactean Vein,</hi> lying between the <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52336:142"/>
aorta,</hi> and the <hi>Vertebra's</hi> of the Loins, cover'd with Fat, runs upwards, and above the Heart, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends by the Gullet, and ſo haſtens to the <hi>left Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavial Vein,</hi> where it ends in one, two or three branches; here a moſt thin valve occurs at the very end of the Vein looking inwardly, that the Chyle might not return back again, or run further into the Arm; out of this Subclavial they deſcend by the <hi>aſcending Trunk of Vena Cava</hi> into the <hi>right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart,</hi> that there by the help of the heat, and natural quality, it may be changed into Blood.</p>
                     <p>Being converted into Blood, it paſſeth by the <hi>Pulmoniack Artery</hi> to the Lungs, which are by part of it nouriſhed, and the reſt of it goes through the <hi>Pulmoniack Vein</hi> to the left Ventricle of the Heart, that it may be more perfectly elaborated; thence by the great Artery is carried to all the parts of the Body, communicating to them nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment for the preſervation of Life.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ways of Conveyance is diſpleaſing to ſome, who would rather retain that by the Meſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raick veins known, and ſo greatly cried up by the Ancients, than admit of a new Truth; therefore they ſay that the Chile, together with the Blood, may by this way be moſt conveniently carryed to the Liver, ſeeing that the Venal Blood is carried not from the Liver to the Guts (which was the falſe Opinion of the Ancients) but from the <hi>Guts</hi> to the <hi>Liver,</hi> and ſo not here to be allowed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motion of each Liquor, already ſufficiently known.</p>
                     <p>But in truth theſe Opinions they defend, rather by a probable Ratiocination, out of their old affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Liver, than that they can make it out by natural or demonſtrative Arguments, or anſwer theſe Queries following.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Why the <hi>Valves</hi> are ſo placed, that they may hinder the regreſs of the Chile into the Guts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Why do they all go together with the Chile to the <hi>Glandule</hi> of the Chile, and none of them to the Liver?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Why are the great Lacteal Veins joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. For what end doth the Chile paſs into the Subclavial Veins? All which can be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Body to the ſight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That part of the Blood which is not altogether uſeleſs, yet not fit for Nutrition,</hi> paſſeth out of the <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> ever joyned together by Inoſculations with the <hi>Veins,</hi> into the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta,</hi> and ſo by their means is brought again into the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> that it may be amended, and again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted.</p>
                     <p>I do not only ſay that the Blood is carried by the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> into the <hi>Heart,</hi> but alſo by the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> into the <hi>Liver,</hi> which I prove by theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Liver is the biggeſt of all the Viſcera</hi>; not that I would infer its pre-eminence from its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) but I ſuppoſe Nature would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have created ſo great a Body, but for the performing of ſome extraordinary operation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Its greateſt Vein, coming out with a large Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, forthwith goes to and enters the Heart.</hi> What neceſſity is there for the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> to be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch numerous Branches through the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo preſently to aſcend into the Heart; for indeed it ought to convey back the Blood not
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52336:143"/>
amended. Its Trunk likewiſe, and that of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Aorta</hi> might aſcend directly up the Body to the Heart, without concerning it ſelf with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, eſpecially when the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> near the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, may alſo yield ſufficient ways for freeing all the Blood from Choler: It ought to receive the Blood concocted in the Liver, and convey the ſame to the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Its colour is red.</hi> I well know that it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerved to be white, pallid, yellow, green; but this colour is to be aſcribed to the Diſeaſe, not to its natural Conſtitution; for in all Bodies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſound, it is found red.</p>
                     <p>What wonder is it, that the Liver being red, in weakneſs ſhould contract a whiteneſs; doth not a red face grow pale, when the Body is affected with ſickneſs? How eaſily likewiſe that the Liver ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Choler, ſhould be died with a yellow or green colour? 'Tis alſo obſerved in the firſt xx or xxx days after conception, it is naturally white, neither becomes red before the maternal Blood (concerning which, ſome of the Moderns have far otherwiſe aſcribed) comes to the nouriſhment of the already formed parts, which is the ſame in all <hi>Spermatick parts,</hi> even in the Heart it ſelf: But will you conclude from hence, that this red colour only happens to the Liver, and is not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it, than it is to the Muſcles, which yet therefore do not make Blood? To this I anſwer, that the affluent Blood is ſo neceſſary here, and ſo appropriated to the Liver, that without it it cannot be called a perfect Liver; but both the colour, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and number of Veſſels are ſo difierent in a Muſcle, and in the Liver, that in no wiſe the parts deſerve to be ſaid to be like one another; and what

abſurdity is it to ſay; that <hi>a Muſcle ſanguifies,</hi> when even the Heart it ſelf by the principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts and Philoſophers, is acknowledged a Muſcle.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The Maternal Blood comes firſt up the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vein to the Liver, ere it goes to the Heart of the Infant:</hi> And the Valves and Ligatures evidently demonſtrate, that the Arterial Blood is carried by the Umbilick Arteries from the Child to the Womb, but the Venal by the Umbilick Vein from the Womb to the Child; but whether the <hi>Infant</hi> is nouriſhed by the Maternal Blood, or by an External Humor, like as a Chicken in the Egg, is to me all one; when 'tis evident, the Blood, which either coming from the <hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Infant,</hi> paſſeth firſt to the Liver, before it enters the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The Choler is ſeparated from the Blood in the Liver</hi>; for every one knows, that there can no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration be made, without there be firſt a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
                     <p>From all theſe Arguments I cannot gather any thing, but that the returning Blood is carried by the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> to the Liver, that it may there be purified, and in ſome manner concocted, in which its operation, that the Blood may be rendred more perfect, 'tis carried to the Heart, eſpecially when by reaſon of its continual and neceſſary Pulſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Blood cannot remain long in the Heart: and for this reaſon I judge, the whole Blood muſt needs be moved about with a circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Blood made in the Liver, as is declared but now in the eighth Chapter, enters the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and from thence into the Heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:52336:144"/>And thus the Royal Liver, at the ſame time, when Kings are taken away, may yet uſe a limited power, and may remain with honour in its own Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhall we do with the Melancholick Spleen, which makes many laugh? It hath many accuſers, and not fewer excuſers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was never accounted by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Learned <hi>Greek,</hi> a receptacle of the Excrements; or is it any where to be found in him, that he call'd the Spleen another Liver.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The great number of Veins and Arteries, and ſo by conſequence the abundance of Vital Spirits, do not permit the Excrements to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It hath not any convenient Cavity wherein the Melancholy, Faeculent Juice can be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And if you imagine that there is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here of a Cavity, its Parenchyma is too thick, and not porous enough, therefore unfit for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſo thick a Humor; which alſo is never naturally found in it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is too great a Bowel to perform ſo vile an Office.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In dead men, where Melancholineſs hath been the cauſe of their death, upon the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Internal parts, there none of them leſs recede from its natural ſtate than the Spleen, the Heart only excepted, whom the Vital Spirits do ſo greatly defend, that it is leſs affected than other parts, which ſeldom happen to the Inteſtines, Kidneys, Gall and Bladder.</p>
                     <p>What is therefore its <hi>Uſe</hi>? It elaborates the Acid Humor, which is very neceſſary, but not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52336:144"/>
Excrementitious, and mingles it as a Ferment with the Blood, by which it becomes more perfect, and fitter for Circulation.</p>
                     <p>In my judgment the Salt of the Blood affords matter to this Humor, which it greatly requires that it may not be corrupted; but this Salt which proceeds from the Meat and drink, is never ſo pure, but that it hath need to be brought to a more perfect ſtate in our Body. But this is my Opinion.</p>
                     <p>The Supremeſt of the Kings is the Heart; to this are two others ſubject, the Liver and Spleen (I beſeech you give me leave to make uſe of this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude in favour of the Ancients) the Heart makes the Blood, the <hi>Liver</hi> repeats the Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſeparates the Choler; the <hi>Spleen</hi> from its own Salt, by an innate vigor, produceth an Acid Humor, which as a Ferment by the Venal Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Branch, it mixeth with the Blood, to render it the perfecter, and the more fit for Circulation; if any Excrementitious part ſhould be there ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, it is all by the Caeliack Artery, and the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhodal Veſſels ſent to the Guts.</p>
                     <p>If it appears to any one to be a contradictory, that by Salt a Humor ſhould be made Acid, we adviſe that perſon to taſte ſome Spirit of Salt.</p>
                     <p>About ſixteen years ſince, the great Anatomiſt <hi>Franciſcus Sylvius</hi> put forth ſome particular things concerning the uſe of the <hi>Spleen</hi>; he was of opinion, that the Blood was not made in the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles</hi> of the Heart, neither that it was carried from the Heart by the Arteries to all the parts of the Body, for nouriſhment-ſake alone, but that it likewiſe underwent ſome other Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the reſt of the <hi>Viſcera</hi>'s, particularly <hi>that the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52336:145"/>
Spleen further concocts the Arterial Blood, and brings it to a higher degree, yea that it more then perfects it,</hi> ſo that the Blood in a manner in this place aſſumes the nature of Ferment, by whoſe means in a ſhort time, a great quantity of Maſs may become acid; in the ſame manner he affirms, that the Blood more and more concocted in the Spleen there receives ſtrength, by which it reſtores the returned and weakned Blood, and preparing together with it the Chile, that it may the ſooner be turned into Blood: The Reaſons which he produceth for it, are theſe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spleen receives a much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood from the Heart, than is neceſſary, for its nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it can be returned back again to the Heart, by no other way than by the Branches of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta</hi>; for what hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been delivered of the ſhort Veſſel, are to be accounted but ridiculous Fictions, as may moſt evidently be made appear in diſſected Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Seeing this Blood is continually mix'd with the returned Blood and Chile in its paſſage to the Heart, it ought not to be an Excrement; for ſo the Noble Parts, and the whole Body would not be purged, but the more injured.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chymiſtry hath long ſince taught us, that ſuch mutations happen daily in Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Remaining Part of the Blood unuſeful to the Body, therefore Excrementious, is thrown out through the <hi>Guts, Ureters, and Parts of the Skin, &amp;c.</hi> concerning which it is not neceſſary to add more here; but now we are forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe thoſe new watry paſſages, which the ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52336:145"/>
in Anatomy have long and diligently inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into. The <hi>watery paſſages,</hi> the <hi>Lymphatick Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels</hi> have their riſe both from the <hi>Liver,</hi> and from the <hi>Joints,</hi> and receive the liquid Juice from the Arteries with which they correſpond.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which come from the <hi>Liver,</hi> embrace the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and ſo paſs to the Miſaraick Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Chile, as do thoſe alſo that aſcend from the Feet; thence they diſcharge their Water into the great Lacteal Vein, which as we have already declared, carries the Chile to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which proceed from the Arm, both lie above and under the Veins, until they come to the Subclavial Vein, which they enter about the ſame place; where the great Lacteal Vein doth, being furniſhed with a particular Valve juſt at their entrance, and ſo altogether they carry the Water to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>This Water is Sweet, not being as Urine is, Salt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Veſſels conſiſt of a very thin Tunicle, whence they are ſoon broke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Uſe</hi> of them in my opinion, is to take the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Water from the Arteries, and carry it to the <hi>Glandules</hi> of the Chile, and Lacteal Vein, by which the Chile being made more Liquid, may the more conveniently be conveyed through the narrower paſſages, thence to return the ſame to the Arterial Blood, making it fitting to ſerve to the nutrition of the moiſt parts, and to the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moiſtening of the hot.</p>
                     <p>But that it may the more clearly appear, in what manner I conceive, how what hath already been ſaid, is perform'd in our Body; obſerve that the Meat is converted in the Stomach into Chile,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52336:146"/>
to which part of the Drink is mingled, this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is carried through the Glandules of the Chile, and the great Lacteal Vein into the Heart, where it is changed into Blood, which is by means of the Arteries to be conveyed through the whole Body; every part of this Blood nouriſheth thoſe parts which are of the like temperament with it ſelf; the Hot part of it nouriſheth the Hot; the Dry, the Dry; the Moiſt, the Moiſt, &amp;c. that which is here not well concocted, muſt be brought back again to be perfected. Why we ſay that the Veins are not ſufficient, and the paſſages not commodious enough to perform the ſame, whoſe Office we know is to bring back to the Heart the Blood not ſufficiently concocted; the Reaſon is that the Water always remaining in the Veſſels, rendered the Blood too thin, ſo deprived it of its natural conſiſtence and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>From all thoſe ſo clearly and diſtinctly laid down, it ſufficiently appears what the CIRCU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATION OF THE BLOOD is, to wit, <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion of the Blood out of the Arteries into the</hi> Vena Cava <hi>and</hi> Porta <hi>to the Liver and Heart, that in them it may be fitted for the Nutrition and the life of the whole Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of the ſubtileſt part of the Blood are the SPIRITS produced, which are two-fold:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Vital,</hi> which begotten in the Heart, carry life to the parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Animal,</hi> who out of the Vitals elaborated in the Brain, impart Senſe and Motion to the Body.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ductus Salivales,</hi> when the ſtring of the Tongue is to be cut, or the Ranine Vein to be opened, or any other Diſeaſe of the Tongue that is to be cured by Manual Operation, warn you to have great care of thoſe little Glandules in which they end, that they might not be hurt with the Launcet, leſt there follow a continual ſpitting.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>great Glandule</hi> alſo of the <hi>Neck,</hi> from whence theſe Ductus's take their riſe, when it is inflamed, admits not of the uſe of Mercury; for from hence a dangerous Salivation may very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be raiſed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> either the greater or the leſſer, are oftentimes from a Contuſion or Wound ſo greviouſly hurt, that they cannot carry the Chile to the Heart; and though the wound be cured with great diligence, care, and ſpeed, yet the Patient will fall into a Conſumption, whence follows Death inevitably: This Truth will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Chirurgeons from many Calumnies.</p>
                        <p>In Children, and older People, is often perceiv'd an induration and inflamation of the Abdomen; the cauſe of which is the hardneſs of the Meſaraic Glandules, which allow not paſſage for the Chile to the great Lecteal Vein, except the very thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of it; whence the fleſh of the Muſcles waſts, the Body becomes heavy and weary, and at length a Feaver, and a waſting of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This evil I uſe to remedy without any great trouble, with this External Liniment.</p>
                        <p>Take compound Oyntment of Marſhmallows
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52336:147"/>
Ointment of Sow-bread, of Martiaton, of each two drams; Oyl of white Lillies, of Camomile, of each three drams: Mix it into an Ointment.</p>
                        <p>Inwardly the following Troches are excellent, being continually uſed the whole time of the Cure.</p>
                        <p>Take prepared Steel, prepared Crabs-Eyes, of each a ſcruple; Vitriolated Tartar, half a dram; <hi>Sal Prunella,</hi> xvj. grains; <hi>Species Aromatici Roſati,</hi> a ſcruple; white Sugar, two ounces: Make them into Troches according to Art.</p>
                        <p>In this caſe <hi>Purging</hi> is not to be uſed, but with <hi>Caſſia,</hi> Cream of Tartar, and Laxative Syrups; for the <hi>Glandules</hi> will not bear ſtrong Purges.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Blood taken out upon the opening a Vein, oftentimes after ſome few hours ſpace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very dry, and deſtitute of all <hi>Serum,</hi> which for the moſt part is aſcrib'd to its too great Heat, and Aduſtion: but this Argument is very invalid for if the ſame day, the ſame, or another Vein be again opened, there will be found a great quantity of <hi>Serum</hi> in the Blood; therefore the true Cauſe is to be deduc'd from the Circulation of the Blood, but eſpecially in the <hi>Lymphatick Veſſels,</hi> which at that time draws the <hi>Serum</hi> and <hi>Humidity,</hi> and ſo leaves the Blood dry.</p>
                        <p>It very often alſo happens, that the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Tumid, Turgid</hi> and <hi>Languid,</hi> upon which the fearful Phyſitian forthwith pronounces nought but dangers.</p>
                        <p>When with the uſe of Internal and External <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> the Patient in a ſhort time may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe is not from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature and debility of thoſe parts the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents call'd Noble; for it may eaſily be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> which theſe parts occaſion;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52336:147"/>
for although the ſick perſons are very dull and weary, yet are they not anxious, but breath free, and the Belly ſwells not much. In the Face, and Joynts eſpecially, is a watry Matter collected; but if the ſwell'd parts are compreſſed by the Finger, we perceive much leſs <hi>Serum</hi> to be contained in the parts, than in a true <hi>Dropſie</hi>; from whence thoſe that underſtand not the true Cauſe, are wont to aſcribe this Inflammation to wind: But the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Veſſels</hi> when compreſt, broke, or by any other way obſtructed, ſo that the natural motion of the <hi>Lympha</hi> is hindred, occaſions this evil.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The Circulation of the Blood,</hi> requires all <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous</hi> and <hi>deprav'd</hi> Humors, which are thrown out either by Nature it ſelf, or that outwardly happen to the Body, at the very firſt inſtant, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be expelled out of the Glandules and the Skin, by the means of attractive Medicines, leſt that the whole Blood in a very ſhort time be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and the Heart it ſelf oppreſt, and ſuffer under it: The which doth ſufficiently declare, how dangerous it is to open a Vein, and to purge in a Venereal and Peſtilential <hi>Bubo,</hi> nay, in all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Wounds; as on the contrary, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it is to caſt forth the offending matter; by the uſe of Sudorifick and Attracting Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: As moreover, how that the invention of the Circulation of the Blood, is of very great uſe in the Art of Phyſick.</p>

                                       <hi>I</hi> Will truly declare to you my Opinion concerning the Queſtion I informed you I had moved in the company of ſome Phyſicians, which was, Why the Bones
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52336:151"/>
which lie under the temporal Muſcles, are not cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inveſted by the <hi>Pericranium</hi> as are the other Bones.</p>
                                    <p>On the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>Janaury 1654,</hi> being commanded by the Honourable Senate of this City, to open the Head of <hi>PETER JACOBS,</hi> Brick layer, then was my Opinion, which I had been hitherto big withal, ſufficiently confirmed; for as ſoon as I had obſerved a great depreſſion in the upper part of the Skull, I alſo found a great quantity of coagulated Blood, which had part of it paſt through the Ears, and part of it remained yet in the Cavity of the Ear; then being very deſirous to know the way by which this Blood had deſcended into the Cavity of the Ear; which, when I had diligently enquired into, I alſo diſcovered the reaſon and cauſe wherefore the <hi>Pericranium</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in this place the temporal Muſcles, and not the Bone under them.</p>
                                    <p>Firſt, The Opinion and the Anſwer (which the Honourable and Experienced Dr. <hi>TULPH</hi> Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> had given to the propounded Queſtion, to wit from whence this Blood ſhould come, which very often in Wounds of the Head flows out of the Ears?) I found to be true and reaſonable; for I perceived, as the Noble Conſul had affirmed to me, that the Blood from the upper part of the Head, did deſcend between the Skull and <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and ſo did enter the ſpace that is between the <hi>Os Parietale</hi> and <hi>Petroſum,</hi> and from thence to be as it was ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a Sieve into the Cavity of the Ear; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in ſearching further, I found the <hi>Os Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi> to be removed a great diſtance from the <hi>Os Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietale;</hi> ſo that in the place where the Bones did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from each other, was a motion obſerved, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the <hi>Os Petroſum,</hi> and ending in the <hi>Os Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietale,</hi>
                                       <pb n="273" facs="tcp:52336:151"/>
there where the Toothy unition in the <hi>Os Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> in the inward part, which is covered with a Callus (as it ought to be in every Articulation) to hinder bruiſing, is obſerved.</p>
                                    <p>And this being ſo, it may be concluded, that the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> if it had inveſted the Bone under the temporal Muſcles, without all doubt it would have paſſed it ſelf between the <hi>Os Petroſum,</hi> whence from its moving and rubbing in eating, ſpeaking, or any other Motion, would haue always felt intollerable pain. Thus have you, Sir, what I thought (hoping to proceed further) the reaſon to the Queſtion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>This Opinion is indeed judicious, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; for in dead Mens Skuls the upper Bone of the Temple is movable as is the lower; and in the Suture of the <hi>Zygomatick</hi> Bone, is a Cartilage found, which is neceſſary in every Joynt; for I confeſs the motion is little, but greater would not be required than what ſufficeth to afford paſſage to the thick Humors, either from External or from Internal Cauſes, collected ſometimes in the Cavity of the Ear, by the which the Brain and Ears may be freed from many and various incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences: I hope time and diligence will give us greater light in this thing.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Cauſe</hi> is ſalt Phlegm; it is for the moſt part a ſtubborn Diſeaſe, and very eaſily returning again.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Cure</hi>] In this caſe are generally uſed, ſtrong Purging, Bleeding, Sweating, Salivation, Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pulling out of the Hairs: But without uſing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52336:155"/>
any of theſe Remedies, I have often cured this Diſeaſe, only with this Decoction.</p>
                        <p>Take Aſhes, (which are call'd by the <hi>Dutch Weidaſch,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pot-aſhes,) with White-Wine, make a <hi>Lixivium</hi> of a moderate Acrimony, in a quart of which, boil the Leaves of Marjorum, Southern-wood, of each two handfuls; of Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-hair, a handful and half; Roſe leaves three pugils: Make a Fomentation.</p>
                        <p>With this let the head be waſhed twice or thrice a week warm; then dry it well with hot Linnen Clothes, and in a few weeks ſpace, the Patient with thus doing, will be cured: You may likewiſe ſometimes uſe gentle Purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In a <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> and great <hi>Cathars,</hi> an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue with great ſucceſs may be made in the Nape of the Neck, becauſe the Cavities of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> are thereabouts joyned to the Jugular Veins; eſpecially in Children, in whom very often the Sutures do too much gape.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Fat things</hi> hurt the Head, becauſe it is not covered with many Muſcles.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. In the Skull ſometimes a rough matter is collected in ſeveral places, which if not remov'd by thoſe Medicines that purge Phlegm, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſcuſſives, in proceſs of time acquire a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great hardneſs, which ſtill increaſing, grow into a perfect Horn, not to be cured, but by Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Upon the Skull likewiſe comes other Abſceſſes, which although they may belong to a <hi>Steatoma, Atheroma,</hi> or <hi>Melicerides,</hi> yet in the Head eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are call'd <hi>Teſtudo, Talpa, Natta.</hi> Theſe give little hope of Cure, where the Bone is much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52336:156"/>
otherwiſe they may be taken away by a Thred, or what is better, by a Knife, when they reject other Remedies. The manner of taking them away by a Knife, is this; the Skin being divided in form of a Croſs, the Bladder is to be taken out, then the <hi>Pericranium</hi> being ſeparated, the <hi>Cranium</hi> is to be ſcraped with a <hi>Raſpatory,</hi> till you come to the ſound part, then ſprinkle upon it ſome Aſtringent powder, and let the Skin forthwith be conſolidated again; which if it be too looſe, a little part of it may be taken away, which is very ſeldom neceſſary to be done, when it may be cloſed enough in the time of the Cure.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. If the <hi>Sutures</hi> of the Skull are too open, they bring a weakneſs upon the Brain; if they are too ſtraightly united, they cauſe the pain of the Head. Experienc'd Chirurgions affirm, that it is as ſafe to uſe the Trepan in the very Sutures themſelves, as any other part of the Head.</p>

The <hi>Muſcles</hi> of the <hi>Head</hi> occaſioning no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing differing from other Muſcles, except upon a Wound, or Contuſion of the temperal Muſcle, a Convulſion eaſily follows; neither ought it to be tranſverſly divided, leſt there happen a diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mouth.</p>

                     <p>Theſe Cavities have the uſe and ſubſtance of Veins, ſo that they may not unproperly be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the Veins.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> or little <hi>Brain,</hi> is more of an Aſh-colour than White, receives <hi>Arteries</hi> from the <hi>Cervicalis</hi> and <hi>Carotide</hi>; yet there are fewer bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches here than in the Brain, as being much leſs.</p>

                     <p>In this third Ventricle are two Cavities; the firſt of them runs to the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> and to the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria,</hi> the other to the fourth Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle contained in the <hi>Cerebellum</hi>; above this Ventricle are obſerved four round Bodies, which are call'd <hi>Teſtes</hi> and <hi>Nates,</hi> to which joyns the <hi>Glandula Pinealis,</hi> which is falſly call'd by ſome the ſeat of the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of late the famous <hi>Sylvius</hi> hath demonſtrated it not to reſide in the <hi>Ventricles,</hi> but without them; by whom alſo it is eſteem'd but a Glandule: and that with more reaſon, becauſe that both he and I have found in it not ſeldom two or three Stones, but ſometimes four, which we yet keep by us.</p>
                     <p>The Bodies being removed, eight pair of Nerves appear, which we have already treated of; on the fore-part of whom joyns the <hi>Rete Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> which is a complication of the Cervical and Carotide-Arteries.</p>

                     <p>THe <hi>Breaſt</hi> now comes to be opened, that we may view the Fountain of Life, which the Celeſtial Truth affirms to conſiſt in the Blood; for what reaſon is it therefore that the Sovereign Sanguification is not attributed to the Heart, where every where, and by all, it is call'd the Original of Life.</p>
                     <p>Within, the Breaſt is inveſted by the <hi>Pleura,</hi> which is afterward doubled, and at length qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupled, extending it ſelf from the Vertebra's to the <hi>Sternum,</hi> and then it is called <hi>Mediaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> dividing the Lungs and Thorax.</p>
                     <p>Near to the Throat there adheres to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaſtinum,</hi> a Glandulous Body call'd <hi>Thymus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lungs drawing in the Air, &amp; ſo cooling the Heart, is furniſhed to this purpoſe with a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chea,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:52336:168"/>
Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or Wind-pipe; this lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gullet, and conſiſts of Cartilaginous Rings, and a double Membrane.</p>
                     <p>The outermoſt of theſe Membranes which is the thinner, ariſeth from the <hi>Pleura</hi>; the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, which is the thicker, from the <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The annulary Cartilages are joyned together with Ligaments, and make not a perfect Circle, as being deſtitute of a fourth part that lies upon the Gullet.</p>
                     <p>The Wind-pipe diſtributes <hi>Branches</hi> through the whole Lungs, which are ſtrong enough, but not at all Cartaliginous.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lungs</hi> themſelves covered with a thin, porous <hi>Tunicle,</hi> conſiſt of a ſoft, red, ſpongy <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the fore-part they adhere to the <hi>Sternum</hi>; in the back-part to the <hi>Vertebra's,</hi> filling the greateſt part of the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>It hath ſeven leſſer <hi>Veſſels,</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeak in their places.</p>
                     <p>The Heart, the Work-houſe of the Blood, the Fountain and Origin of Life, as the Sacred Writ it ſelf alſo witneſſeth, is included in a certain Caſe, call'd by Anatomiſts, <hi>Pericar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>: It conſiſts of two Membranes, the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt comes from the <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi>; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt from the Veſſels of the Heart; it contains a clear watry Liquor, void of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony, which we no longer doubt of to be brought from the Ductus's of the Limpha.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> it ſelf conſiſts of a fleſhy, ſerene and hard ſubſtance, which is inveſted with a proper <hi>Tunicle,</hi> furniſhed with <hi>Fibres</hi> of all ſorts, and like a Muſcle is continually moved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:52336:168"/>It is placed in the middle of the Breaſt, but the point of it inclines ſometimes to the left ſide.</p>
                     <p>In Figure it is like to a <hi>Pine-Apple,</hi> having in its upper part two Auricles or little Ears, which alwayes beat before the Heart it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>In old people, the right Auricle is bigger than the left, which in Infants is the contrary; in the throwing forth of the Blood, the Auricles, as well as the Heart it ſelf, are purſt together, and dilated as often as they take in the Blood; and this Conſtriction and Dilation makes the Pulſe.</p>
                     <p>For the concoction, reception and throwing forth of the Blood, it hath two Cavities, and four Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>The Cavities are diſtinguiſhed by a fleſhy Diviſion, in which I could not yet find any way appointed for the motion of the Blood out of the right Ventricle into the left, although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Anatomiſts do certainly affirm it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe Cavities</hi> are divided into the right and left; the <hi>right,</hi> which is the greater, receives the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and <hi>Arteria pulmonalis,</hi> or <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi>; the <hi>left,</hi> which is the <hi>leaſt,</hi> receives the <hi>Arteria aorta,</hi> or great Artery, and <hi>Vena pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalis,</hi> or <hi>Arteria venoſa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of theſe Veſſels, as alſo of the Nerves, and Chylous paſſages, or the Thoracick lacteal Veins, we have treated of in the firſt Book.</p>
                     <p>Under the Wind-pipe in the Cavity of the Breaſt, lies the <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> or Gullet, reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vertebra's.</p>
                     <p>About the fifth Vertebra of the Back, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines a little to the right ſide, that it may give way to the <hi>Arteria aorta,</hi> unto the eleventh
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52336:169"/>
Vertebra; thence with a ſtraight <hi>Ductus</hi> it paſſeth the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> into the lower Belly.</p>
                     <p>It conſiſts of a double Membrane; the ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt is fleſhy, having ſtreight and round Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, the innermoſt tranſverſe and oblique: Many add to theſe a third from the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and rightly in my opinion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> in nature of a Fan, ſerving to reſpiration, divides the Thorax from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen, and adheres to all the Baſtard-Ribs, to the Cartilage of the Breaſt-bone about the Vertebra's, ſending two fleſhy Proceſſes to the lower parts.</p>
                     <p>Its edges round about are fleſhy, variouſly movable like a Muſcle, but its Center Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and very ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>It hath three perforations, 1. In the middle of it, through which the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> paſſeth. 2. In the left ſide, through which the Gullet, with the adjacent Nerves. 3. About the Vertebra's, for the paſſage of the <hi>Arteria aorta,</hi> with the <hi>Vena azygos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It receives more Nerves than any other part of the Body from the Collar-Bones to the Feet, which ariſe not only out of the Brain, from the <hi>Parvagum,</hi> but alſo from the Spinal Marrow, and from the fifth and ſixth Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra of the Neck.

                     <p>It is a double Membrane; its riſe is rather deduced from the membranous quality of the Soul, than from the Meninges of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>It is joyned to the Diaphragm, and to the firſt and third Vertebra of the Loins.</p>
                     <p>It is thicker in Women from the Navel to the Privy Parts, and therefore ſtronger, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating about the <hi>Os pubis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Men it is thicker from the Navel to the Diaphragm, and after it hath received the Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Veſſels, as in a Sheath, it ſends them through the outer Membrane to the Teſticles, where it conſtitutes their firſt Coat.

                     <p>The <hi>Omentum</hi> or <hi>Caul,</hi> keeping the Stomach and Inteſtines warm, is very fat and double; yet it conſiſts of very thin <hi>Coats,</hi> which are perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with many little holes.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Guts</hi> are joyned to the Stomach, which convey the Chyle, and expel the Excrements; they are almoſt of the ſame ſubſtance with the Stomach, and are all divided very well into the thick and thin.</p>
                     <p>The thin Guts are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Duodenum,</hi> in which the <hi>Veſica Fellea,</hi> with the <hi>Ductus Coledochus,</hi> and the new <hi>Ductus Pancreaticus</hi> are inſerted.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Meſentery</hi> conſiſts of a double ſtrong <hi>Membrane,</hi> with many Glandules between each Membrane, which are ſo very ſmall, that they can ſcarce be perceived by the Eye; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly after a long ſickneſs, three excepted, they ſhew themſelves, and are greater than their natural conſtitution, long, white and hard.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt of them is ſeated in the midſt of the Meſentery, which being preſt, yields Milky juice, ſometimes thicker, otherwhile thinner, which is nothing but Chyle, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do the other two, which for the moſt part are in the left ſide, under the Emulgent Vein, above the Muſcle <hi>Pſoas,</hi> not far from the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebra's of the Loins.</p>
                     <p>As theſe Glandules receive many Lacteal Veins, ſo each of them again produceth a Branch, which forthwith being joyned together, make the <hi>Thoracick Lacteal Vein,</hi> which aſcending, as hath already been declared, carries the Chyle to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pancreas</hi> or Sweet-bread, lies under the Stomach like a Pillow, joyned to the Gut <hi>Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,</hi> into the which the late invented paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, from the Author, call'd <hi>Ductus Wyrſungi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> penetrates; in this is often Choler found, but never Blood.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p>It is of a darkiſh red <hi>colour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It joyns to the bottom of the Stomach by the means of the ſhort veſſels, and to the Baſtard Ribs, and left Kidney, to the Caul &amp; <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and to the fleſhy part of the Diaphragm, by the aſſiſtance of Carnous Fibres.</p>
                     <p>There is no Bowel abounds with ſo many <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> as the Spleen, except the Brain.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Nerves,</hi> which it receives from our ſeventh pair, are diſtributed through its Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, rather than through its Parenchyma.</p>
                     <p>It is not placed in the fore, but back-part of the left ſide, near the left Kedney, lying upon the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Ribs and Vertebra's, which is to be well obſerved.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Liver,</hi> the Inſtrument of Blood, Mother of the great Veins, is ſituate in the right <hi>Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drium,</hi> and covers a great part of the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>It is divided (as it were) into two parts, by the Umbilical Vein, which after-birth ſerves it for a Ligament.</p>

                     <p>Some few Arteries it receives from <hi>Coeliaca,</hi> and ſerveral Nerves from the Spinal Marrow, and from our ſeventh pair.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And above the Kidneys are two hollowed Glandules, called <hi>Renaes ſuccenturiati,</hi> or <hi>Capſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae atribilariae</hi>; theſe are furniſhed with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the Emulgent <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries,</hi> and with <hi>Nerves</hi> from the <hi>Par vagum.</hi>

                     <p>Within the duplicature of the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> it deſcends downward upon the Muſcles of the Loins to the Bladder, into whoſe Neck it is inſerted; then it aſcends upwards between the Membranes, where it perforates the innermoſt Coat; and through the ſame hole, together with the Ureter of the other ſide, enters the Bladder, which is ſo very little, &amp; ſo ſtraightly cloſed, that there needs not here any <hi>Valve</hi> to hinder the return back again of the Urine.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Neck</hi> of the Bladder is very fleſhy, and by the aſſiſtance of the Fibra's, like a Sphincter it opens and cloſeth the Bladder; in men it is longer, narrower, and more crooked; in Women, ſhorter, wider, and ſtraighter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Veſſels</hi> that bring Blood to the Bladder, are the branches of the <hi>Hypogaſtrick</hi> Veſſels; it receives many <hi>Nerves</hi> from the ſeventh pare, and from the <hi>Os Sacrum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spermatick Veſſels</hi> yet remain, which wonderfully vary according to the diverſity of the Sex.</p>

                        <p>Take Naval-Pitch, Colophony, of each three ounces; Muſſilages, of Marſhmallow-roots, two ounces and an half; <hi>Ammoniacum, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> Maſtick, Mirrhe, Frankincenſe, of each an ounce and half; <hi>Propoleos,</hi> Miſletoe of the Oak, round Birthwort, burnt Braſs, yellow-Wax, Turpentine, of each three ounces;

In which no other Medicines are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than what we have already in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared: But theſe are chiefly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of; 1. That the Bandage is not to be bound too hard. 2. You muſt not put in the Probe too deep, nor too often. 3. The Hand and Fingers are to be placed upright, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending. 4. Theſe Parts are eaſily affected with a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> which theſe ſigns certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce: When there is no matter in due time; the Lips in the beginning are dry, or yield a little thin moiſture; the heat, pulſation, and redneſs is greater here, than in the fleſhy parts; afterwards the Lips are turned in, and become livid, and at length black.

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Tumors</hi> in the <hi>Knee,</hi> are very dangerous and hard of Cure, by reaſon of the firmneſs of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the great number of Ligaments, Tendons, and Bones, and the cold and dry nature of the parts, not being of force ſufficient to diſſipate the moiſture; therefore 'tis moſt neceſſary to aſſiſt it with warm Medicines as ſoon as poſſible; and if any ſigns of Suppuration appear, forthwith let it be opened, leſt otherwiſe the Patient becomes lame, the Part waſtes, and at laſt happens death it ſelf.

                  <div type="part">
                     <p>THE Plague is a Diſeaſe whoſe nature is not to be comprehended by us; the Cauſe thereof ſeems to proceed from a Spirituous and Infectious Vapour, which is powerful enough to make a ſudden diſſolution of the conſiſtence of the Blood, by which means the Heart is deprived both of ſtrength and life.</p>
                     <p>I do aſſert that the Nature of it is not to be comprehended by us, as well becauſe it is a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted on us by the immediate hand of Almighty God, who vouchſafes not that his Incomprehenſible Wiſdom and Eſſence (which is ſometimes faintly deſcribed to us) ſhould be narrowly pryed into by his creatures; as alſo that it is in it ſelf ſo mutable, that if we ſhould ſeriouſly recollect our ſelves, and recount the ſeveral Peſtilences wherewith all former Ages have been viſited; we ſhall not thereby be able to inſtance in two of that whole number which have agreed with each other in all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: From whence we may eaſily infer, that in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52336:187"/>
the Cure of this Diſeaſe, an Experienced Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian may much more ſafely follow the Dictates of his own Reaſon, than adhire ſtrictly to the Method &amp; Preſcriptions of others. For although it doth ſometimes by the more remarkable ſymptoms ſufficiently evidence it ſelf, yet we cannot likely diſcover its Nature and Eſſence, although we ſhould the moſt induſtriouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it.</p>
                     <p>But that we may cautiouſly enquire into it, we muſt know that it is ſometimes not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by any Fever: And it is neceſſary that what Phyſician ſoever is ignorant of this ſhould either by peruſing good Authors, or his own Experience, acquaint himſelf throughly with it. I have been ſent for to ſeveral Patients my ſelf, who although they appeared otherwiſe in good health, not refuſing their meat, nor diſturb'd in their ſleep, have nevertheleſs had Buboes ariſing in their Groin, on their Neck, under their Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, or behind their Ears, which have apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered a greater Malignity than could be diſcerned in thoſe Buboes, which in other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been attended by a violent Fever: And many hereupon who have been incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and lightly regarded the cautions which I have given them upon this account, have with great danger to themſelves experimented, that as ſoon as thoſe Buboes have ſunk down, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential Symptoms which have appear'd, have been very dreadful, and much more dangerous than in thoſe that have carefully uſed the means preſcribed to them, who have been alſo much more eaſily and ſpeedily cured than the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:52336:187"/>
                        <hi>Sometimes the Plague is accompanied with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>; and again, <hi>there are ſome Peſtilent Fevers without the Plague.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To diſtinguiſh this Fever from the Plague, I uſed to obſerve, that they that are ſeized with it, complain of pain in their Head and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which ſometimes is diſperſed over the whole Body; ſometimes it confines it ſelf to the Arm-pits; the Neck, the Parts behind the Ears, or to the Groin. To outward appearance, there is not the leaſt ſwelling. If the Patient by ſuch means as is requiſite be provoked to ſweat at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, the pain utterly ceaſeth, and in a few dayes he will be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored to his health, the Diſeaſe not having at all diſcovered it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by any outward Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Why ſuch a Fever ſhould be accounted a Species of the Plague, I ſee no reaſon; But there is no one but will confeſs it to have ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that Body on which Buboes, Carbuncles, and Spots do outwardly appear.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the Plague is either <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External</hi>; but unto which ſoever we impute it, it is neceſſary to conclude, that there is in it a power of diſſolving the natural Conſiſtence of the Blood, and depriving the whole Body of its ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Inward Cauſe,</hi> which is <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> it is evident to all, that it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in any Body whatſoever ſo great &amp; ſudden a change; but it is moſt certain, that by a long &amp; continued courſe of bad Diet, the Blood may by degrees be after ſuch a manner diſſolved, weakned, and corrupted, that ſome part of it aſſuming to it ſelf a malignant quality; a man
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:52336:188"/>
may be ſurprized by a ſudden Diſeaſe, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be deprived of life it ſelf; which hath been obſerved in ſick perſons at ſeveral times, when there hath been no contagion in the place, nor any ſuſpected, who have been troubled with perfect Buboes, and other Symptoms of the Plague, much more intolerable than others have been at any time when the Air hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>outward Cauſes,</hi> every one confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that there are ſuch; but their Nature is known but to few: The Chymiſts, who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the force of Fire diſtinctly to ſeparate the Parts of ſimple Drugs, endeavour to find the Original of the Contagion in a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> which ſuddenly diſſolves the fixed Salt of the Blood; which hath indeed ſome appearance of truth, though it will not be reliſhed by all men.</p>
                     <p>If you enquire into the Cauſe hereof from others, their anſwer will be various, but moſt of them very idle and impertinent.</p>
                     <p>It hath by ſome been thought probable that a Plague might proceed from the <hi>Heavens</hi>; they affirming that the <hi>Stars</hi> do actuate the Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Bodies, both by the influence of their Light, and by ſeveral other qualities inherent in, and peculiar unto them. But the Conjectors raiſed from hence, are very uncertain, and the foundation of them unſecure. We are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Fopperies of Aſtrology, and of the vanity of thoſe Predictions, which have no other Foundation than the ſeveral Courſes, the Conjunction and Oppoſition of the Stars; which are all ſo frivolous, that we cannot think it worth our labour to refute them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:52336:188"/>We acknowledge that the <hi>Air</hi> may be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways corrupted; from whence the Vapors which have been received from the Earth, are ſent down again amongſt us, which like Fire may inkindle our Blood, <hi>Corrupt waters, Carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> either not at all buried, or elſe ſhallowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred; the South-wind, which may be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote the Putrefaction; <hi>Men</hi> already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, &amp; ſucceſſively imparting the Contagion to the ſound, &amp; by that means ſpreading the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom through the Bodies of Men, &amp; the Air itſelf.</p>
                     <p>This Peſtilential Infection may likewiſe for a long time lie couched and concealed in <hi>Straw</hi> or <hi>Stubble,</hi> amongſt <hi>Garments, Hangings,</hi> and the <hi>Furniture of Beds</hi>; which we have ſometimes obſerved ſtrangely to impart their Malignity to thoſe that have handled them, or approached unto them.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe things only inform us of the means by which this Peſtilential Poyſon is conveyed unto us; but no one hath as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what it is, and wherein its Nature doth properly conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Symptoms of it are theſe.</hi> The ſick perſons are ſeized with a ſhivering all over their Body, which is preſently followed with an inward heat, which is oft-times very intenſe, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great thirſt; ſomtimes the thirſt is exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, &amp; the Fever moderate. But whether the heat of the Fever be great or ſmall, it is moſt commonly accompanied with a dryneſs of the Tongue, &amp; an Urine of the ſame conſtitution which you might expect from a man in perfect health: They are taken ſometimes with a great drowſineſs, ſometimes with a Dilirium, or with
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52336:189"/>
an exceſſive pain in the Head; &amp; in this caſe, the white of the Eyes appeareth of a Saffron-colour, &amp; they are more wakeful than is conſiſtent with their eaſe &amp; quiet: great pain at the Heart, the Pulſe ſeems ſmall, if not at firſt when you touch it lightly (for then it oftentimes appears to beat high) yet at leaſt when you preſs it cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with your Fingers. The ſtrength fails in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, &amp; decreaſeth much more viſibly than in the moſt burning Fever, which hath no Malignity attending it. Some are taken with a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> which can by no means be ſtopt: Others bleed much at the Noſe, the Eyes, the Ears, or Mouth; ſome at the Yard or Womb. Some are troubled with a continual Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, others with a Nauſeouſneſs. On ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies there appear red or purple ſpots; &amp; on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Buboes behind their Ears, on their Neck, under their Chin, in the Groin, and under the Arm-pits: In ſome there break forth red Wheals or Puſhes; in others white Bladders, or Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And whereſoever theſe Bladders, Buboes, Carbuncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do appear, they are a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of the Plague, although the bigneſs of them may be inconſiderable; eſpecially if they either accompany, or are Conſequents of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſticks, we muſt conſider, that the Plague is a very treacherous Diſeaſe, and whilſt it flatters us moſt, it intends us the greateſt miſchief. A Bubo is leſs dangerous than a Carbuncle, and a Carbuncle than the Spots, which very ſeldom portend leſs than preſent death whereſoever they are diſplay'd.</p>
                     <p>A Bubo behind the Ears, on the Neck, or
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52336:189"/>
under the Arm-pits, is more dangerous than that in the Groin.</p>
                     <p>Carbuncles on the Hands and Feet, may by ſome be thought leſs pernicious, becauſe they are more remote from the Heart; but ſince they happen amongſt many Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, they are more to be feared than thoſe which appear in other parts of the Body which are better covered with fleſh.</p>
                     <p>A Carbuncle ariſing after a Bubo, is a ſign of Death. If a Bubo or Carbuncle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Fever, there is leſs danger than if they follow it at a diſtance, and ariſe ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>A blew Circle encompaſſing the Bubo the ſecond day after its appearance, is a ſign of Death.</p>
                     <p>If a Bubo ſuddenly diſappears, the ſtate of the Patient is dangerous, unleſs Nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth the Malignant Humour to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have often obſerved, that upon the retreat of <hi>that Morbifick Matter</hi> which hath cauſed a Bubo in the Groin, there hath appeared a Gangrene in the Foot, and on the ſame ſide which was before affected, and many have by that means eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>If a Cupping-glaſs applied to the Patient, raiſeth no Bliſter, we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his condition to be deſperate.</p>
                     <p>It is an infallible ſign of Death, if after Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terization, or the application of a Cupping-glaſs, the Carbuncle abates not in 12 or 24 hours, as likewiſe if there is no moiſture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it; but if a Bladder appears, or any ſeparation of the matter be made

(which is ſo much the better, by how much it is the greater) with a ſufficient purulency, <hi>the Patient is then paſt danger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Carbuncle which ſeems to have a little tail, or puſh at the end of it, is very dangerous, as are likewiſe thoſe which look white; which, unleſs the Fever doth very much abate, are certain forerunners of Death.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient that hath a Bubo in his Neck, or behind his Ears, be troubled with a pain in his Throat, and a difficulty in ſwallowing, and no conſiderable Inflammation appear, we have always found it a certain Rule, that in this caſe he outlives not 12 or 15 hours.</p>
                     <p>Sleep more ſound than ordinary, <hi>Diliriums,</hi> waking often in the night, inflammation of the Eyes, pain at the Heart, a trembling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of the Joynts, are all very dangerous Symptoms, but do not always portend Death.</p>
                     <p>A great Fever without a pain at the Heart, is not ſo dangerous as a leſſer, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with that Symptom.</p>
                     <p>The greatneſs of the danger may ſometimes be judged from the great dryneſs of the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>If by the adminiſtration of <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> Sweat is not provoked, the Patient uſually miſcarrieth.</p>
                     <p>A Flux of Blood was heretofore held dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in all Plagues; but in our Age, all that can either bleed at the Noſe, or have their Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua's, come off ſafe: We have no preſident of any that have piſſed Blood; but a <hi>Diſſentery</hi> is the ſign of an approaching Death.</p>
                     <p>It is very certain, although it but ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that incurable Carbuncles do break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Eyes, Noſe &amp; Stomach, &amp; even amidſt the Entrails themſelves.</p>

                     <p>I can inſtance only in one, who after he had for 30 hours or more been troubled with the Spots, at length, after exceeding great pain, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a <hi>Delirium,</hi> he voided firſt, Blood and after that, <hi>a purulent matter through his Yard,</hi> by which means he was reſtored to his health; I conjectured that there was a Carbuncle in the caſe, which ſeized not on the Membranous part of the Bladder, but on the Neck thereof.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Cure; Blood-letting</hi> is very prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to thoſe that already have the Plague, and dangerous to ſuch that would prevent it.</p>

Wherefore I would adviſe you ſeriouſly to conſider, if by opening a Vein, you invite it immediately to the Heart, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diminution of Blood, Spirits and Strength, which is effected by this means, be not the Cauſe why the Heart is ſuffocated and deprived of that vigour which it ſhould make uſe of to repulſe the Enemy. I confeſs ſome Experienced <hi>Phyſitians</hi> of good credit, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that in hot Countries there is no better means for reſtoring a Patient viſited with the Plague, unto his health, than that of opening a Vein, provided it be done cautiouſly, and at the beginning of the Diſeaſe; but whoſoever have attempted it in colder Climates, have quickly learnt by experience, that it ought to be forborn.</p>

                        <hi>Purging,</hi> which is oftentimes very neceſſary in other gentle Diſeaſes, is excluded by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of this. But every one is not quick-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough to diſcern when it is requiſite to be done, and when to be forborn: Moreover, it is evident, that in a Malignant Diſeaſe, the Phyſick which is adminiſtred to a Patient, ought to be more mild and gentle than at other times; for beſides that the Body cannot then bear ſtrong purgations, a <hi>Dyſentery</hi> is oftentimes the conſequence of them. I have when I have been fully perſwaded that there was no Malignity in the Diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> oftentimes uſed this, or ſome ſuch like Potion with good ſucceſs, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take Rhubarb, a dram and half; Senna, two drams; Cream of Tartar, a dram; Scorzone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra-Roots, half an ounce; Aniſeeds, half a dram; Boil them in Holy-Thiſtle-Water, and to three ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, and Syrup of Succory, with Rhubarb, ſix drams; Spirit of Salt, a little; Confection of Alkermes, a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: Make it into a Potion.</p>
                     <p>I never adventured to preſcribe any thing Purgative to ſuch as have been taken with the Plague, before the fourteenth day, at which time the Fever and the other Symptoms of the Diſeaſe would be abated. There are ſome who have attempted it while the Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles remain purulent, and before the Bubo is perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>But I dare not adviſe any one to follow that Method, whatſoever Remedies they adminiſter at the ſame time, which may be intended ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically againſt the Plague.</p>
                     <p>But if it happen that the Patient for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:52336:192"/>
days be very coſtive, and troubled with a pain at his heart, and hopes to be relieved by <hi>Purgation,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is to be conſidered, that the Venom of the Diſeaſe, and not the Coſtiveneſs is the cauſe of the pain at the Heart; it is therefore moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make uſe of <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Heart, and not to concern your ſelf for the coſtiveneſs of the Body: but if you deſire to open it a little, it is better to make uſe of a <hi>Suppoſitory</hi> than a <hi>Glyſter,</hi> which is not altogether ſo ſafe, but hath been prejudicial to many on this occaſion: and to others it hath done but little good, and not at all oppoſed the Malignity of the Diſeaſe: But to ſuch as will not take this adviſe, which hath been very confirmed by experience and ſeveral good Reaſons, and will ſtill perſiſt to make uſe of <hi>Glyſters,</hi> it is fit however that they forbear to preſcribe <hi>Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> as an Ingredient, eſpecially to Women in the time of their Flowers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Juleps</hi> are in this caſe very neceſſary; but all perſons may not make uſe of them, nor any at all times. I am never wont to preſcribe them without joyning with them ſome <hi>Sudorificks</hi> (which will appear hereafter) and this I take to be the ſafeſt courſe; for if the ſick perſon ſhould make uſe of ſuch things only as refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate while he ſweats freely, the Sweat would oftentimes ſtrike inward, and the Venom would be conveyed to the Heart, from whence would follow ſudden Death.</p>
                     <p>There is no means more requiſite than that of <hi>Diaphoreticks</hi> and <hi>Cordials,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that are acid, which produce ſuch effects as are
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:52336:193"/>
certain, and therefore the more laudable; for they rectifie the Maſs of Blood, and free it from the venom which infects it. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the pituitous Matter which is lodged in the Stomach and the Entrails, and correct the Choler, which in this Diſeaſe is the cauſe of much miſchief. Nevertheleſs the ſeveral diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this Diſeaſe, and the vanity of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which attend it, do require that they ſhould be often changed; ſince when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is more gentle, thoſe things are not to be uſed, which would do good ſervice in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute one.</p>

                        <hi>Weſop</hi>-Ale, or ſome ſuch like, which is well boyl'd, may here be very uſeful, eſpecially if ſome Nutmeg ſcrap'd, or a piece of calcin'd Harts-horn be tied up &amp; ſteeped in it. Nor need we fear any miſchief from exceeding either in the quantity or the frequent repeating of it; but we muſt take heed that it be not given cold, leſt Gripings, Flux, and a pain at the Heart, &amp; ſuch like Maladies ſhould be cauſed thereby.</p>
                     <p>To ſuch who have weak ſtomachs, &amp; a pain at their heart, I do uſe to give the liberty, when their <hi>Fever</hi> abates, to drink <hi>Moſel,</hi> or <hi>Rheniſh-wine</hi> with Sugar, &amp; the juice of <hi>Limons,</hi> provided that they take it in a moderate quantity: But I believe they do err very much, who preſcribe to their Patients, whilſt the <hi>Fever</hi> continues ſtill very high, ſome ſort of <hi>French Wine,</hi> either alone by it ſelf, or mixt with their <hi>Sudorificks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Oriental Stone, call'd <hi>Lapis Porcinus,</hi> or <hi>Pedro Porco,</hi> is of very great uſe, if it be ſteeped for a while in your ordinary Drink; for it ſtrongly provokes Sweat, and very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth the Heart.</p>
                     <p>This Stone, if I miſtake not, is generated in the <hi>Gall</hi> of an Hog, for it is exceeding bitter; and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:52336:197"/>
though it be very hard, yet every time it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, it abates ſomewhat of its quantity, which is diſcoverable by the Tincture which it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts to the Liquor. Nor is the Gall of a man ſometimes void of ſuch Stones, which are like unto thoſe taken out of an Hog, in ſavour, hardneſs and colour; and we might find them too perhaps in their efficacy likewiſe, if we thought fit to make trial of them.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Fever</hi> is often accompanied with <hi>drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which forbids the uſe of the principal <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Treacle, Mithridate, Diaſcordium, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe there is <hi>Opium</hi> in their compoſition, which makes them not ſo effectual for the preventing of ſleep. It is more requiſite to uſe this following, which is agreeable for diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Vapours which infect the Head, and the heat about the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Take Salt of Rue, of <hi>Scordium, Prunella,</hi> of each half a ſcruple; Vitriolated Tartar, 8 grains; our Prophylactick Water, an ounce; Balm-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as much as ſufficeth; Syrup of Betony, an ounce: Mix them for a draught.</p>
                     <p>Let Sweat be thereby provoked, and let it be the care of the Attendants, that after the firſt or ſecond day, the Patient may be kept from ſleep, if it be found that he hath ſtrength to bear it.</p>
                     <p>There is ſometimes joyn'd with the <hi>Fever, continual Watchings, and a great pain of the Head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not uſe to be much concerned for the watchings, although it ſhould continue for the firſt three days without intermiſſion, for it often falls out, that by the uſe of <hi>Sudorificks</hi> only, the pain is the firſt day abated, on the 2d becomes tolerable, and on the third is quite taken away.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Opium</hi> hath in it the virtue of cauſing Sweat, and is a great Ingredient in <hi>Treacle, Diaſcordium,</hi> and <hi>Mithridate,</hi> which without it, would not in my judgment have that <hi>Sudorifick</hi> quality, for which they are now noted. It is alſo reckoned by ſeveral Authors amongſt thoſe Medicines which are famous for diſpelling of Poiſon, whoſe uſe is very requiſite in all malignant <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>; nor do I believe that there can any other Medicine be named which gives ſo preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the Patient as <hi>Opium</hi>; concerning the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof, they are able to give a better account, who have been frequent and curious in the uſe of it. I have ſometimes in this caſe (though contrary to Cuſtom) given it ſparingly, when I have found the ſick perſon not to ſleep in the firſt, ſecond or third days: But when he hath waked for ſix or ſeven days together, and found a great decay of ſtrength, this following Preſcription, taken every quarter of an hour by a ſpoonful, till ſleep hath ſeized on him, hath afforded great relief, and the ſleep produced thereby, hath been undiſturbed, and of long continuance.</p>
                     <p>Take our Prophylactick-water, an ounce &amp; half; Borage-water, an ounce; Cinamon-water, three drams; Confection of Hyacinth, a dram; Lozenges of Sugar pearl'd, three drams; <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Opiat,</hi> two grains: Mix them.</p>
                     <p>You may ſafely make uſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> after the manner before mentioned; but in Gachectick &amp; infirm Bodies, whoſoever gives it too boldly, or is fearful of preſcribing it at all, diſcovers that he underſtands not its Virtue and Efficacy.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to the uſe of <hi>Opiat Laudanum,</hi>
                        <pb n="364" facs="tcp:52336:198"/>
I endeavour to eaſe the pain of the Head by theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> by applying Ground-Ivy bruiſed to the nape of the Neck, and to the ſoles of the Feet, and palms of the Hands; this, or ſome ſuch like Compoſition.</p>
                     <p>Take Leaves of Rue, a handful and half; ſowre Leaven, two ounces; Pigeons dung, an ounce; common Salt, half an ounce; Elder-Vinegar, as much as ſufficeth to make it into a Poultice, to be applied to the ſoles of the Feet, and palms of the Hands.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Bolearmenick, ſeal'd Earth, common white Chalk, of each half an ounce; Vinegar of Marigolds, as much as ſufficeth: Apply it as before.</p>
                     <p>To the Forehead I have often applied the Powder of Cloves, moiſtened with the Spirit of Wine; for I take Vinegar to be hurtful, as are alſo all Emulſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vomiting and the Hiccough</hi> is another ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Plague. It hath been obſerved by ſeveral who have been ſo curious as to open Bodies which have died of the Plague, that <hi>Carbuncles</hi> have often appear'd in the Stomach, and amongſt the Entrails, whoſe teſtimony is not to be rejected, ſince it is ſo agreeable both to Reaſon and Experience.</p>
                     <p>Theſe (If they are not the Cauſe of the Vomiting and Hiccough, may be eaſily remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a ſpoonful of this following Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taken cold every quarter of an hour.</p>
                     <p>Take Mint-water, our Prophylactick-water, of each an ounce and half; Cinamon-water, half an ounce; Confection of Hyacinth, a dram; Salt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:52336:198"/>
of Coral, a ſcruple; Syrup of Myrtles, half an ounce; Roſe-Julep, half an ounce: Mix them.</p>
                     <p>By the uſe hereof, the Vomiting is uſually ſtay'd, eſpecially if the Stomach be ſometimes anointed with this following Oyl.</p>
                     <p>Take Oyl of Nutmegs by Expreſſion, a dram and half; Oyl of diſtill'd Mace, half a dram; Oyl of Wormwood, a dram: Mix them.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while, let the ſick perſon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to drink too plentifully, and as ſoon as the Vomit is ſtayed, let him make uſe of ſome good Sudorifick.</p>
                     <p>Another Symptom of the Plague is a <hi>great Flux</hi> which is uſually a ſign that Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth; but when the ſick perſon hath not voided meer blood, nor any thing of a bloody ſubſtance, I have ſometimes found theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Preſcriptions to be ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>Let him abſtain from all things that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acid or ſalt; which except in this caſe, are of great uſe in the Plague; and likewiſe from drinking much: But if his thirſt be ſo exceeding great, that he cannot bear it, let him take one, two or three ſpoonfuls of this following Mixture.</p>
                     <p>Take Tormentil-Roots, an ounce; Red Roſes, a handful; Shaving of Harts-horn a dram; Seeds of Sorrel and Mirtle, of each a dram: Boil them in Smiths water, and to nine ounces of the Liquor, add of the Confection of Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth, a dram; Syrup of Mirtles, an ounce. Mix them.</p>
                     <p>Many have alſo from Treacle alone received great benefit by ſwallowing a little of it every four hours, till they have taken the quantity
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:52336:199"/>
of a dram; as likewiſe from this following, taken by ſpoonfuls.</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> his <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> two drams Amber, half a ſcruple; red Coral prepared, Dragons blood, of each a ſcruple; prepared Pearls, half a ſcruple; Fennel-water, an ounce; Plantane and Roſe-water, of each an ounce and half; Syrup of Comfery of <hi>Fernelius,</hi> an ounce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mix them.</p>
                     <p>Clyſters of an aſtringent, drying &amp; emollient quality, given twice or thrice in a day, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in this caſe been found very neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Take Roots of Comfrey the greater, an ounce; Biſtort and Tormentil Roots, of each three drams; Oak-leaves, half a handful; Flowers of Balauſtians, Red Roſes, of each a pugil; Aniſeeds, three drams: boil them in Cows Milk that hath been burnt to; into 8 ounces of Liquor, diſſolve of Venice Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, two drams: one Yolk of an Egg, white Troches of <hi>Rhaſis,</hi> a dram; Honey of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, half an ounce; of Roſes, an ounce: Make a Clyſter,</p>
                     <p>The Bathing of the Belly with the Lees of white or rather of red Wine, and the applying to it afterward a warm cloth three or four times doubled, have by ſome been found to be of ſingular benefit, or elſe the Ointment and Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter following may be made uſe of.</p>
                     <p>Take Oyl of Maſtick, of expreſt Nutmegs of each a dram; Oyl of Dill, Wormwood, Myrtles, of each two drams; old Treacle, three drams: Mix them.</p>
                     <p>Take Bolearmenick, Franckincenſe, Maſtick, Dragons-blood, of each two drams; Mummy,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:52336:199"/>
three drams; Powder of Galls a dram &amp; half; Seeds of Carrots Lovage Aniſe, Myrtles of each a ſcruple; Oyl of Nutmegs by expreſſion, three drams; Venice-Turpentine, as much as ſufficeth to make it into a Plaiſter.</p>
                     <p>And thus much may ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning the inward Symptoms of the Plague; the outward are three, the <hi>Spots,</hi> call'd <hi>Petechiae,</hi> the <hi>Bubo,</hi> and the <hi>Carbuncle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spots</hi> can hardly any other way be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter removed than by inward Remedies, but they do uſually portend ſome miſchief.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bubo,</hi> I am wont to deal with after this manner following. At the firſt appearance of it, and although the ſwelling hath arrived to no conſiderable height, I draw a Bliſter, without making uſe of Cupping-glaſſes, which by reaſon that they cauſe a great deal of pain, &amp; create a Fever, &amp; draw unto them both the good &amp; bad Humors, &amp; cauſe a greater alteration than was before in the Blood, I do utterly lay aſide: After 7 or 8 hours cutting the Bliſter. I apply unto that part a Magnetick Plaiſter of Arſenick; the virtue whereof is ſo great, that I know not any more excellent; which will appear to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall make uſe of it; the account of it out of <hi>Hartman</hi> and <hi>Agricola,</hi> is as followeth.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The Magnetick Arſenical Plaiſter.</head>
                        <p>Take Crude Antimony, yellow Brimſtone, white Arſenick, of each two ounces.</p>
                        <p>When you have beat them very ſmall, let them be put into a Viol covered in Sand, to which you muſt apply fire till they are all mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; appear to be of a dark red colour; when
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52336:200"/>
it is cool, it may be taken out of the Veſſel, and this is that which they call the <hi>Arſenical Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and hath not in it any thing of Poyſon, as it may be eaſily experimented upon Dogs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Gum Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> of the Arſenical Magnet, of each three drams; Turpentine of the Larch-tree, Wax, of each half an ounce; Oyl of Amber, two drams; Dulcified Earth of Vitriol, a dram.</p>
                        <p>Let the Gums be diſſolved in the ſtrongeſt Wine-Vinegar, and ſtrained through a Linnen Cloth, let them after that be boiled up to their former conſiſtence, then melt the Wax and the Turpentine together by themſelves, &amp; when you have taken them off from the fire, ſtir them well till you have brought them to the conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an Ointment; then add to them the Gums beforementioned, &amp; the Arſenical Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, together with the Earth of Vitriol, and Oyl of Amber, &amp; you will have that plaiſter which is moſt effectual for drawing forth all ſorts of Poyſon.</p>
                        <p>I have found the virtue of this Plaiſter to be ſuch, that if it be applied to thoſe parts where the Skin is ſomewhat hard, it leaves not the leaſt ſign of a Scar, and yet doth ſo plentifully draw forth the malignant Humor, that a <hi>Bubo</hi> of the bigneſs of a Walnut, will in the ſpace of 5 or 6 days be utterly taken away; but becauſe it doth not always ſo ſuddenly produce this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is often very neceſſary to raiſe a Bliſter for evacuation of the Humors. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that in ſome ſtrong Bodies it cauſeth no Eſcar at all, unleſs when the Bliſter hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52336:200"/>
not only the outward, but alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Skin. But in Children, and more tender Bodies, it will of it ſelf cauſe an Eſcar, although there be no Bliſter drawn before the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                        <p>This Eſcar or Cruſt is the true ſeat of the Venom, which is extracted, &amp; is of that thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (eſpecially conſidering that the Skin is but ſuperficially corroded) that it is well worth our while to conſider it. For I do believe that to be the reaſon why it is much ſooner ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated than other Cruſts or Scars that are cauſed by Art; for in the ſpace of 24 or 36 hours, if no Scarification hath preceded, it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily taken off without any, or at leaſt with a very ſmall pain, if you make uſe of any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtilential Plaiſter, and add unto it ſome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Baſilicum,</hi> or elſe the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Eſcar may be very much promoted by this Ointment.</p>
                        <p>Take Virgins-Honey, Ducks-greeſe, of each an ounce; Soot, ſix drams; Turpentine, an ounce; Yolks of two Eggs, Treacle, three drams; Oyl of Scorpions, as much as ſufficeth to make it into an Ointment.</p>
                        <p>But if the Tumor is not ſufficiently abated when the firſt Cruſt is taken off by the Arſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Magnetick Plaiſter, it is requiſite that you create a ſecond or third, and then proceed as before.</p>
                        <p>The Ulcer may be conſolidated by a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Minium,</hi> of White Lead, <hi>Diapompholigos,</hi> or ſome ſuch Remedy which drieth up the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and bringeth the Ulcer to a Cicatrice: But we muſt obſerve this by the way, that this
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:52336:201"/>
Conſolidation is not to be wrought too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, leſt part of the poyſonous Humor which ſtill remains in the Body, ſhould cauſe ſome new Diſeaſe, which may be fatal to the Patient.</p>
                        <p>For want of the Magnetick Plaiſter, you may make uſe of this following, if you take care firſt to raiſe a Bliſter, the vertue whereof hath been found to be very great by ſeveral, for the taking away of painful <hi>Scrophula's,</hi> and the excellent qualities that are in it, have made it famous by the name of</p>

                        <p>The ſuppuration of a <hi>Bubo</hi> is very rare, the means neceſſary for it, are ſuch as Chirurgeons are very well acquainted with, and are not, if Nature inclines to it, to be neglected.

them) ſhews it ſelf in ſeveral ſhapes; but the Symptoms of it are many times very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: It is eaſie to conclude of it when ever it diſcovers it ſelf by a little Puſh of a dark Purple Colour, with an Inflammation round about it; but often appears with a White Puſh without any conſiderable prominency, which ſeems to contain a ſort of purulent Matter that portends no miſchief; but if you ſqueeze it, you will find it dry and very hard, and it eats very deep into the Skin underneath it.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes there appears one ſingle Bladder filled with Limpid Matter, which if it be not opened in the ſpace of 24 hours, it grows black, and upon its diſſection ſends forth two or three drops of black Blood.</p>

                     <p>Flight is very allowable to Chriſtians, if it be conſiſtent with their quality and condition of Life; but let thoſe that make uſe of this, not depend too much upon it, but remember that it is not poſſible to fly beyond the reach of the Omnipotent.</p>
                     <p>And to take theſe Directions with them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they <hi>fly early, go far off, and be ſlack in their return.</hi>

                     <p>When we go out into the Air, either by day or night, we ought to take ſpecial care that it be clear and free from Vapours.</p>
                     <p>To which intent it hath been in ſuch caſes very uſeful, and found exceding advantageous
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52336:203"/>
to keep good fires both in publick an private, ſince the Air is by nothing ſooner nor more effectually purified.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo very neceſſary that the Houſes be daily waſhed, which if it be done with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar inſtead of Water, it is much better.</p>
                     <p>Things of a ſtrong Odour, ſuch as <hi>Amber, Musk, Civet, Benjamin,</hi> &amp;c. do not only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Malignity, but attract the Venom to them, and have been found hurtful by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and are therefore conſequently to be concluded ſo by reaſon.</p>
                     <p>It is uſeleſs and ridiculous to anoint the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils with <hi>Treacle</hi> and <hi>Mithredate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thoſe things which do really purifie the Air, are <hi>Amber, Pitch, Mirrhe, Frankincenſe,</hi> the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Berries of Juniper, Sulphur, Aſſa Foetida, Horn</hi> (but eſpecially <hi>Gunpowder</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either kindled, or put upon a few lighted Coals.</p>
                     <p>Such as take Tobacco, do very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the virtue of that Plant; I do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve the uſe of it, though as much as I can, I void the Smoak.</p>
                     <p>An inordinate Diet is very hurtful at all ſeaſons, but eſpecially in a Peſtilential one. There can be nothing preſcribed in general which may agree with each man in particular; there is very much to be allowed to Cuſtom, but we muſt at all times induſtriouſly avoid all Meats that are difficult to be concocted, and take great care that the Stomach be not overcharged.</p>
                     <p>For our Diet (<hi>if we can ſo contrive it</hi>) we ought to make choice of Veal, Mutton,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:52336:204"/>
Beef, Pullets, Capons, Peacocks, Larks, Chaffinches, Quails, Hares, Conies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perch, Pike, Whiting, Sole, Salmon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eggs, Butter, Green and Parma Cheeſe, Buttermilk; Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chory, Endive, Sorrel, Lettuce, Chervil, Parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Roſemary, Sharp-Apples, Quinces, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Oranges, Capers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, Fleſh and Fiſh which hath been dried and ſalted, are very hurtful; as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and Pork, Haddocks, Eels, Crabs, Shrimps, Green Fruit, and all things that are hard of Digeſtion.</p>
                     <p>Walnuts are very much commended, and not without good reaſon; for there may be very much uſe made of them: The green ones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, do much good to thoſe that abound with Choler; but ſuch as are come to their full ripeneſs, whether you take them freſh gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or when they are more dried, all that make uſe of them, will tell you that they are very pernicious.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrongeſt Beer, and Wine of a middle ſtrength, are very uſeful at ſuch times, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately taken; but we cannot allow that any, except ſuch as are very ancient, ſhould dayly make uſe of ſtrong and ſweet Wines, nor of Spirit of Wine and Brandy.</p>
                     <p>Go not forth into the Air with an empty Stomach, but always take ſome Preſervative againſt Infection.</p>
                     <p>Take our Prophylactick Water, 6 ounces; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep of Roſes, 3 ounces: Mix them; take the quantity of a ſpoonful or two each morning.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take our Prophylactick Conſerve, 3 ounces;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:52336:204"/>
take the quantity of a Cheſtnut in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or as often as you are to go to an infected place.</p>
                     <p>Vinegar, and all ſharp things have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by long experience; but they will not well agree with ſuch as are troubled with a Cough, weakneſs of Stomach, or the Cholick, if they are taken either alone, or in too great a quantity.</p>
                     <p>I never had any great eſteem for outward means, but thoſe that can fancy it, may wear about their Neck this Amulet.</p>
                     <p>Take Arſenical Magnet, a dram; Benzoes, as much as is ſufficient; make them into great rowls, and ſew them up in red Lawn.</p>
                     <p>We have before deſcribed the Arſenical Magnet when we treated of the Bubo.</p>
                     <p>Sleep and Watching, exerciſe of the Body, and the uſe of Women, if immoderate, are very hurtful.</p>
                     <p>Coſtiveneſs is prejudicial, but not ſo much as a great looſneſs.</p>
                     <p>Sadneſs, Fear and Anger will make very ſtrange alterations in the Blood; he who knows how to moderate thoſe Paſſions, is moſt prudent.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Plague</hi> at that time raged very much in the next Town, which was very populous: but there had as yet appeared no Symptoms of it in this of ours: We met with no outward ſigns of any Malignity, nor did thoſe within ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo conſiderable, as to forbid the breathing of a Vein, which the <hi>Delirium</hi> did very much preſs us upon: I therefore preſcribed a Cordial Mixture, which might alſo be <hi>Sudorifick</hi>; whereof 2 ſpoonfuls was to be taken each quarter of an hour, and after the ſpace of one hour a Vein to be opened in the right Arm, and ſeven ounces of Blood to be taken from thence: I had more than once before made trial of this Mixture in a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Spots: The Deſcription of it is as followeth.</p>

                        <p>A Midwife which went trembling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady, gave me occaſion from thence to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome extraordinary weakneſs in her, or a <hi>Delirium:</hi> nor was I miſtaken; for when I came to feel how languidly her Pulſe beat, I found it evident; but yet I could diſcover no outward Symptom: nevertheleſs the drineſs of the Tongue, the difficulty of Breathing, and ſuch other ſigns did diſcover that ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity was concealed within; at length upon
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:52336:208"/>
enquiry, ſhe told us that ſhe had a puſh upon her right Thigh, which, upon ſearch, we found to be a Carbuncle of the breadth of a Shilling. She would not grant that ſhe had any <hi>Bubo</hi> in her Groin (which nevertheleſs I doubted not of) nor ſuffer the Chirurgeon to ſearch. He gave her what was requiſite to be applied outwardly, &amp; I preſcribed her a Sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick; after two days ſhe recovered her ſtrength &amp; became of a right mind, &amp; the 3d day ſeemed to be perfectly well; but on the Evening of that day all was changed, ſhe became reſtleſs and almoſt diſtracted, and died that night.</p>
                        <p>She had taken before I was ſent for, <hi>Manna</hi> with <hi>Cream</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and after that, <hi>Tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds,</hi> all which doing no good, but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſtill encreaſing upon her, ſhe conjecturing that there was ſome Malignity in it, took an ounce of <hi>Plague-Water</hi>; which, though it were much weaker than the Malignity requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet ſhe took it for two dayes by my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but on the third (whatſoever I perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the contrary) ſhe changed all her Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, even to her Head-cloaths, and drank Whey in which <hi>Tamarinds</hi> had been boiled, from whence proceeded her ſudden change for the worſe, and upon that her Death; and theſe are the effects of ſelf-conceitedneſs.</p>

In the mean while he ſweat plentifully, and all things gave his Friends to hope that he would again recover; but I was of another mind, as knowing well the nature of this treacherous Diſeaſe. The ſame Evening he took another <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> and ſlept quietly enough all night. On the 21 day the Cheek that was affected, diſcovered on it ſome moiſture, the Fever continued as it was: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his forefinger and his middle one there brake forth a very painful Carbuncle, which affected the whole Arm. To this there was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied another actual Cautery without any great alteration diſcerned in the Patient; then we preſcribed him a Julep which might cauſe Sweat, &amp; ſome food that was nouriſhing, but no

Sweat appear'd, &amp; the affected places being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the reſt, fore-boded an ill event. At 9 in the Morning another Chirurgeon was ſent for, who approved of whatſoever we had done in this caſe; at midnight he fell into an high <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as it hath been thought convenient by ſeveral good Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, to contrive a ſafe way of <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> for the benefit of young Beginners in that Profeſſion; and whereas Dr. <hi>LOWER</hi> of late, in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Heart,</hi> hath diſcovered a plain and ſecure way of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> and given a figure of the <hi>Lancet,</hi> which he commends for that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52336:223"/>
purpoſe, I have been adviſed, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, to tranſlate what he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and likewiſe give the figure of the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> and deſcription of the Uſe of it, as it is printed in the <hi>166</hi> page of the laſt and trueſt Edition of his Book, Printed at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam 1671.</hi> in the Author's own words.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HOw great Ebullition ſometimes happens in the Blood, in what veſſels, and with what ſwift motion it is caſt about every where through the Body, and if an Artery be opened how quickly, and with what force it breaks out, it hath been hitherto treated of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Diſcourſe; by which it appears, how neceſſary ſometimes <hi>Blood-letting</hi> is, to diminiſh its Quantity, or to ſtop its Career, and how dangerous the Adminiſtration of it is, if it be performed by a rude and unskilful hand.</p>
                  <p>For it often happening, either by want of skill, or common practice of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> (which makes the Mind fearful, and conſequently the Hand trembling and uncertain) that an <hi>Artery</hi> is opened, or a <hi>Nerve</hi> or <hi>Tendon</hi> cut or prick'd, whence follows Swellings, Pains, Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Gangrenes or Convulſions, which put the member in danger of being cut off, or render'd uſeleſs, I thought it might not be beyond the ſcope of my Treatiſe, if, by way of <hi>Appendix,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52336:223"/>
I ſhould ſhew by what means and Inſtrument any Vein might be ſafely and ſecurely opened, (if it ſwell upon a Ligature (though it have an Artery, Nerve or Tendon immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch therefore as never any harm happens in <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> unleſs a Vein be prick'd through or ſlipping aſide, the <hi>Lancet</hi> be put too deep into the part, the Fabrick of this <hi>Lancet</hi> is ſuch, and ought to be ſo put into the Vein, as both may be eaſily prevented.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Lancet</hi> is ſo contrived, that it is not cutting on each ſide, unleſs it be near the point, but is purpoſely blunt, and made round on the lower ſide, which is to be applied next to the skin, that it may more eaſily ſlide over it, as it appears by the following Table, in which.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>a</hi> the <hi>Lancet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>b</hi> the place where the upper edge of the <hi>Lancet</hi> ends in a plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>c</hi> where the under edge of the <hi>Lancet</hi> ends, the reſt of the under part being poliſh'd round, and thick, (but not made thicker than the upper plain part) that it may not grate or tear the skin (upon which it muſt be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) by its compreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Which figure of the <hi>Lancet</hi> differs nothing from a common ordinary <hi>Lancet,</hi> but that the under edge of it is blunted almoſt to the point.</p>
                  <p>The way of uſing it is only this, that the Member being tied, and the Vein ſwelling, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52336:224"/>
                     <hi>Lancet</hi> muſt be applied as near to it as poſſible, but ſo that the <hi>Lancet</hi> may be depreſs'd as much as may be; then the Point of it being directed upwards, it muſt be gently, and by an oblique tranſverſe Inciſion be put into the Vein: which if ſo directed, neither can the Vein avoid the point of the <hi>Lancet,</hi> or the parts underneath be any way offended. Which way of <hi>Blooding,</hi> as it is moſt eaſie, ſo it will never prove unhappy to any one, though but meanly skilful.</p>
                  <p>And though I do not write this to <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgeons,</hi> who are expert and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed in bleeding; yet having ſeen many peoples health and life endangered, either by ill Blood-letting, or becauſe a good <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> could not timely be called in by <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who moſt commonly forbear the Practice of it, therefore I have deviſed this figure of a <hi>Lancet,</hi> that they may more ſecurely and confidently uſe it.</p>

                  <p>WHilſt I was in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> in the year 1612. in the City of <hi>

                        </gap>orsk,</hi> I was entertained with great kindneſs by that Noble and Valiant Gentleman, <hi>Alexander de <hi>Schweichel,</hi>
                     </hi> Governour of the Place and Works, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the other things worthy ſeeing, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me the <hi>Military Cheſt</hi> of the moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Heroe, Maurice,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange, &amp;c.</hi> wherein not onely <hi>Medicines</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments,</hi> but alſo <hi>Linnen, Rowlers,</hi> and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were prepared, and diſpoſed all in order in a Room, but not as then put into the Cheſts, which were fitly contrived for that purpoſe, becauſe that the <hi>Garriſon</hi>-Souldiers might be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52336:225"/>
ſupplied with what they needed for their healths; and alſo that the Medicines that were wanting or decayed, might be forthwith renewed: an evident ſign, and great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Piety, Prudence, and Care of this <hi>Prince</hi> towards his Souldiers. This <hi>Cheſt,</hi> as often as neceſſity required march'd with the Camp, and in the greateſt and moſt dangerous occaſions the Souldiers were for the preſent ſuccoured, and aſſiſted from it. Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were carried to the next Cities, where they were taken care of by Phyſicians and Chirurgeons, appointed and paid by the <hi>States</hi>: and if by chance any Souldier loſt a Limb, or was lame, he was relieved, and had an Annual Penſion from the <hi>States.</hi> This Pious and Chriſtian Conſtitution made the Souldiers deſpiſe all dangers, and incouraged them to be both valiant and daring.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that <hi>Generals</hi> may underſtand what things are moſt neceſſary to furniſh a <hi>Cheſt</hi> with, I thought good to ſet down both the principal Medicaments, and Inſtruments, that a Chirurgeon, following the Camp or Sea, ought to be provided with; and if there ſhould be occaſion for any others, he may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh himſelf at the next Shop he comes at.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cheſt</hi> ought to be ſo divided into Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and <hi>Claſſes,</hi> that all confuſion and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing of Medicines may be avoided, and the Virtue and Propriety of each preſerved. To this purpoſe I have divided it into twenty <hi>Claſſes.</hi>

                     <head>CLASSIS XIX. Inſtruments.</head>
                     <p>Beſides the above recited Medicines, it is alſo moſt requiſite, that a Chirurgeon ſhould be furniſhed with neceſſary Inſtruments, without which he cannot perform his duty as he ought. They may be divided into two ſorts, ſome to be fitted for a Box, which he ought continually to carry about him in his Pocket; theſe ought to be made ſmall and little, that they may neither load him, nor afright the Patient: the others are to be kept in the Cheſt, whilſt occaſion calls for their aſſiſtance. I never viſited my Patients with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Box of Inſtruments in my Pocket, in the which were contained the following:</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Razor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>pair of Sciſſors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Two Inciſion Knives,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Four Lancets</hi> to bleed withall.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>crooked Knife</hi> to open Apoſtems.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Flegm,</hi> to divide the Gums in the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Extractor,</hi> to take out forreign things out of Wounds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52336:230"/>A <hi>pair of Forceps</hi> for the ſame uſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Needles,</hi> to ſtitch up great Wounds, which are to be of different Sizes, ſome great, others ſmall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>ſtitching Quill,</hi> which is uſed in ſtitching Wounds: it ought to be of that length, as to contain the Needles within its hollowneſs. Wounds of the Fleſhy parts only are to be ſtitcht, nervous parts in no wiſe. In wounds of the face I never uſe Needle, but that which is called the <hi>dry ſtitch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spatula's,</hi> great and little.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Probes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Speculum oris,</hi> one end of which, in affects of the Jaws, and Throat, is to depreſs the tongue, the other to ſcrape it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vula-ſpoon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Burrus</hi> quill, to ſprinkle Powders upon Wounds or Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Hook,</hi> ſingle at one end, and two at the other.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Hone,</hi> to ſet the Inciſion-Knives, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I had all theſe Inſtruments, and many more, made me by a skilful Artiſt in Silver, which I uſed only within the Town, Patients being leſs afraid of them than of Iron: but at Sea and at Camps it is not ſo ſafe for a Chirurgeon to have them of Silver, therefore they may be very conveniently made of Iron or Steel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Probes, which ought to be made of Lead, Copper, or Latin.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Inſtruments a Chirurgeon ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have about him, as alſo a Salvatory with ſix diviſions, which ought to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52336:230"/>
1. with <hi>unguentum Baſilicon,</hi> 2. with <hi>ung. Aureum,</hi> 3. <hi>Apoſtolorum,</hi> 4. <hi>Nutritum,</hi> 5. <hi>Album Rhaſis,</hi> the 6. with <hi>Rubrum Exſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivum,</hi> or <hi>de Minio</hi>: it ought to be made of Horn, or ſome ſolid wood, as Ebony, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacum, or Box, for Unguents are better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in wood, than in Silver, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is alſo requiſite that he hath about him in a Pewter Bottle ſome oyl of <hi>Roſes,</hi> to anoint any wounded part, it eaſeth pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other pot with a digeſtive.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Inſtruments, which a Chirurgeon ought to wear about him; now follow the others, and firſt of thoſe that are us'd about the Head.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Trepans,</hi> by which the Skull is perforated in great Contuſions, to give paſſage to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated and concreted blood collected in the head.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Levatories,</hi> to raiſe the depreſſed skull.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Scalpra's,</hi> to ſcrape the carious skull.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A <hi>great Speculum oris,</hi> by which the Tongue, in great inflammations of the Jaws and Throat, is depreſs'd.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Another <hi>ſpeculum oris,</hi> to force open the Mouth, which, as I have ſeen ſometimes in <hi>ſpaſmus's,</hi> to be ſo cloſe ſhut, that a drop of Broth could not be poured in.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Several Inſtruments</hi> to draw Teeth.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And becauſe ſometimes in eating, a fiſh-bone or the like is fixt in the Throat, and ſo would ſuffocate the perſon, therefore it is neceſſary for a Chirurgeon to have in his Cheſt ſuch an Inſtrument, as I have deſcribed in the 36 <hi>Obſervation of the firſt Century:</hi> but if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52336:231"/>
he hath it not at hand, let him forthwith make faſt a piece of <hi>Spunge</hi> to the end of a Catheter, and thruſt it down the Throat.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to draw forth Bullets from Gunſhot-wounds, of which there are divers ſet down by Authors. I eſteem that the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, whoſe Deſcription you may ſee in the 88. <hi>Obſ. of the firſt Century.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. A <hi>great Saw,</hi> for amputating great Members.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A <hi>little Saw</hi> for the diſmembring Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Toes; it not becoming a Rational Chirurgeon to ſeparate them with Chiſſels, as I have more largely ſhewn in my <hi>Treatiſe of a Gangrene, &amp;c. chap.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Becauſe in amputating, the greater part of Chirurgeons uſe a Knife, it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to have <hi>one well ſet,</hi> and <hi>ſtrongly fixt in a Handle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. A <hi>crooked Knife</hi>: its Deſcription ſee in the <hi>above named book of a Gangrene.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13.

                     <head>CHAP. II. What care a Souldier is to take of his Body.</head>
                     <p>THe Mind being thus taken care of, thou art to adviſe with a skilful Phyſician con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy Body, whether it be not neceſſary to purge it, the better to ſecure thy ſelf from Agues and Fevers. Then furniſh thy ſelf with ſome Mithridate or Treacle, to uſe it againſt Infection; taking of it in the morning faſting, againſt the ill Air, the quantity of a Haſel-Nut. Take alſo with thee a quantity of <hi>Zedoary, Angelica, Imperatoria</hi> or <hi>Maſterwort,</hi> and <hi>Carlina</hi>; of which thou ſhalt do well, now and then to eat ſome for the preſervation of thy ſtrength, and againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Air. But eſpecially keep thy Head and Feet warm, by the neglect of which thou maiſt caſt thy ſelf into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Take heed of ſurcharging the ſtomach, which is to prepare and to convey the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52336:234"/>
for the whole body, and reſtrain as much as thou canſt thy appetite, there being nothing more hurtful to health, than when that is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and extravagant.</p>
                     <p>Gird thy ſelf well, that thy body may be cloſe, and ſo be ſecured from receiving miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in leaping, falling, ſtorming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thy bowels from being put out of their place.</p>
                     <p>Take alſo with thee out of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's ſhop a powder, called <hi>Pulvis ſolutivus de Tribus,</hi> which is not dear. Of this, when thou needeſt purging, take the weight of a <hi>ducat</hi> or a little more, according to thy conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in warm fleſh-broath or the like, early in the morning faſting; ſo ordering the matter, that that day thou maiſt keep thy ſelf warm in thy quarter. Faſt two hours after the taking of it, and then eat warm meat. The ſame be done with <hi>Pulvis Sena Montag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nana,</hi> and <hi>Pulvis ſolutivus de Tartaro.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If thou be troubled with <hi>Corns</hi> on thy feet, apply to them every day freſh lard, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this, till by the fatneſs of the lard they grow ſoft; and then they will fall off from the very roots without pain.</p>
                     <p>To free or ſecure thy ſelf from <hi>Vermin,</hi> take a good quantity of Wormwood, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cuttings of horſe-hoofs, cut out by the Farriers when they ſhooe horſes; boyl theſe both together in half lye and half water, and ſo put thy ſhirt into it, and afterwards dry it in the Air, without waſhing it out any other way, and not a Lowſe will come into it. This Experiment is found approved amongſt the old <hi>German</hi> Souldiers; and although there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52336:235"/>
ſhould be a Lowſe in thy ſhirt, it would not ſtay there.</p>
                     <p>If thy feet be moiſt and ſweaty, (which is very troubleſome not only to thy ſelf, but to others alſo,) take the filings of Braſs, which are ſometimes uſed for duſt to dry moiſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings with, and put ſome of it into thy ſocks, and walk upon it. Refreſh this every other or third day, and thou ſhalt ſoon be freed of that inconvenience: Nor be thou troubled, that it makes, as it will do, thy feet look greeniſh; for there is no hurt at all in that, ſince you are not like to put them in your cap.</p>
                     <p>Take alſo with thee ſome Stags or Bucks-greaſe, to make uſe of in caſe thou ſhouldſt be galled any where in riding, or going on foot. Anoint the part therewith at the fire-ſide, and it will ſoon be healed.</p>
                     <p>To prevent Ruſt, draw thy Sword through the fat of a Gooſe or a Capon, or greaſe thy Arms therewith.</p>
                     <p>Take care to have always about thee a hard cruſt of Rye-bread; for if thou art dry, and deſtitute of water, wine or beer, to quench thy thirſt, chew ſome of this dry cruſt, and it will moiſten thy mouth, and conſiderably abate thy thirſt. The ſame may be done with a Leaden-bullet, rolled to and fro in the mouth, Lead being cooling.</p>
                     <p>It hath been preſcribed above, to take with thee the Herbs <hi>Imperatoria</hi> and <hi>Carlina.</hi> Of this be mindful; for if it ſhould happen, that thou ſhouldſt be obliged to ſtand ſome hours in battel or in the field, take a piece of it in thy mouth for hunger, thirſt, and refreſhment,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52336:235"/>
and thou ſhalt find, it will keep thee a good while from faintneſs. But woe to thy fellows, if they want it; for they will certainly faint, unleſs thou be ſo kind as to give them a ſhare in thy proviſion.</p>
                     <p>In the beſt Apothecary-ſhops may be found a root, called <hi>Coſtus,</hi> ſomewhat like Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; which hath the ſame effect. And if others ſhould eat Onions, others drink Brandy, and I only hold in my mouth of this root the bigneſs of half a Pea; I ſhould keep in breath a good while longer than they. But take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that this, I ſpeak of, is not the common <hi>Coſtus,</hi> which hitherto hath been ſold for the true in common ſhops; but that which comes to us from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If thou art a Horſe-man, take a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bay-ſalt, a little Brimſtone, Clove, and Ginger, and mingle with it ſome of the powder of the two above-ſaid herbs, <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria</hi> and <hi>Carlina,</hi> and give it to thy Horſe, or in caſe of want of Provender let him have of it upon his bit, or give him ſome upon a ſlice of bread, and it will make him ſtrong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous.</p>
                     <p>If thou art to ride in a <hi>German</hi> Saddle, the two hind-knobs whereof are wont only to be ſtuffed out with ſtraw or horſe-hair; get thee made two Tin-flasks with good ſcrews, fitted for thoſe places. In one of them carry Brandy, in the other Vinegar. The Brandy will ſerve thee in cold nights, and freſh mornings; and and 'twill be good alſo for thy horſe, giving him a little of it upon bread. The Vinegar will be of uſe to thee for the heat of the day,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52336:236"/>
waſhing thy mouth with it, as alſo ſpirting a little of it into thy horſes mouth. Beſides ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with water, it will afford thee a good cooling drink.</p>
                     <p>If it he very cold, put ſome of that horſe-hair, that is wont to be curried out of their mains and tails, into thy Boots. I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on ſuch occaſions more warmth from any thing, eſpecially keeping my ſelf dry. A Hares-skin is alſo good for this purpoſe, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſocks of it; but if it grow wet, 'tis naught.</p>
                     <p>Gather of the Wheel-greaſe that runs out at the nave of the Wheels, and would elſe be loſt, which hath taken in ſome of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Iron that is about the Axel-tree, witneſs its blackneſs: This is a good Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Horſes.</p>
                     <p>When thou comeſt into the field, and art to lye abroad, look out for ſome riſing ground, that the Rain, which may poſſibly fall, may run away from thee: And avoid as much as is poſſible. Vallies, Mariſhes, Ditches, Meadows, and the like low and moiſt places.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, obſerve the <hi>Air,</hi> and put up thy Tent towards the Eaſt; which quarter though it be cool, yet 'tis wholſom. But leſt it ſhould be too cool, order it ſo, that thou mayſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that wind, which comes from between the Eaſt and South, as being one of the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt of all Airs, and temperate, the South-air qualifying the ſharpneſs of the Eaſtern. Beware of the Weſtern wind, eſpecially that which blows from between the South and Weſt. The Air of Mid-night is wholſome
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52336:236"/>
enough and dry, but ſharp and piercing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, a Souldier is much concern'd in the Air; nor hath <hi>Hippocrates</hi> without cauſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a whole Book <hi>De Aere, Aquis &amp; Locis,</hi> to teach, how the Air, Water, and Places are to be diſcerned and choſen.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, look about thee for good clear <hi>Water,</hi> ſuch as grows warm and cool again ſooner than other waters; and obſerve this mark for my ſake. I know water, that will not boyl Peaſe, Vetches, Stock-fiſh, Floun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſome Springs Iron is turn'd into Braſs, and great care is to be had in the choice of water for drinking.</p>
                     <p>But if thou canſt not have Spring-water, but art neceſſitated to uſe Pit or Ditch-water; have a care not to drink it without ſtraining, leaſt thou ſhouldſt ſwallow Frog or Snake-ſpawn. For I have known and had in my cure a Countrey-man, who voided, though not at once but at different times, two hundred fifty and five Frogs, and of them many in my own houſe, in the preſence of divers Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Perſons; and ſome of the biggeſt of them, being dried, are ſtill to be ſeen in the Repoſitoy of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as alſo in that of Mr. <hi>Philip Hainhofer</hi> at <hi>Auſpurg.</hi> And there is a Cook in the Hoſpital of <hi>Weſſenburg</hi> or <hi>Landsberg,</hi> who, (as appeared by the event) had drunk the Spawn of Serpents, out of which were bred divers Serpents in his Body, ſome of which he voided by vertue of the Medicine he took, amongſt which there was one of the length of a <hi>Bavarian</hi> Ell. The Man hath been ſince in good health, and continues in his ſervice to this day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52336:237"/>Wherefore it will behove you to ſpread your handkerchief over the Ditch-water, and ſo drink through it; or if you take any of it up unſtrain'd, quench firſt a red-hot Stone or Iron in it, whereby the noxious quality will be deſtroyed. Or, if you lye ſtill, and can get any Oyl of Vitriol, let ſome drops of that fall into it, and you need not then fear any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or poyſon in ſuch water. Otherwiſe, if time will permit, let it boil up and cool again, and put a cruſt of bread into it, and you may drink of it ſafely.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Waters that run out of ſtony hills and from under rocks, are the beſt; to which may be reckon'd thoſe Springs, that flow from high places, and purge themſelves in clear ſand and pebles.</p>
                     <p>If thou meet with Beer or Wine, take heed of exceſs; and forbear drinking New beer that hath not yet done working, or is not ſome days old, becauſe new beer cauſeth the <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury.</hi> And in caſe <hi>this</hi> ſhould trouble thee, take a handful of Hay-bloſſoms, boyl them in water, and Urine over it, drawing into thy body the warm ſteam thereof, and anointing thy Navel ſeveral times with warm ſuet.</p>
                     <p>If thou art hot, and canſt not forbear drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, make water firſt; then waſh thy mouth, and cool the arteries on both thy temples, and thoſe of both thy wriſts, and then drinking will hurt thee leſs.</p>
                     <p>If you chance to drink whilſt you are hot, (which is ſo dangerous a thing that ſome have dyed within 24 hours after it; others have fallen into conſumptive Coughs, others been
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52336:237"/>
troubled with Pains in their ſides and with Impoſtumes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) then take of the leaves of <hi>Bellis</hi> or <hi>Daiſy,</hi> which grows in all meadows and paſture-grounds, and is green both win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſummer, and waſh them clean, and dreſs them like a Salad with Oyl, Vinegar and a little Salt, and forthwith eat thereof; and it helps immediately, as I know by much Experience. But this muſt be uſed preſently, the ſooner the better. I can ſay with truth, that in all my Practice of Phyſick for above 20 years I have not met with any Experiment of ſo quick an Operation from any herb, as from this. But here I muſt note, that I have always uſed the <hi>Red Daiſy,</hi> and have not tryed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorts; though I am apt to believe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may have the like effect. You muſt not eat the Flowers, but only the Leaves. This Experiment ſhould be put up on all poſts eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, for the good of Courriers, Mowers, and other labouring Men, that are wont to drink plentifully when they are hot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſpoil themſelves in great numbers.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed; as thou art to beware of exceſs of drinking at all times, ſo thou art eſpecially to forbear when thou art to ſtand Sentinel, leſt thou ſhould fall a ſleep; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou mayſt loſe thy life, at leaſt, thy place and thy preferment for ever.</p>

Diſlocations, <hi>Eryſipelas's</hi> or St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Fires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Phyſicians ought to be no Youngſters, that are lately come from Schools and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, knowing only in Controverſies and Diſputations, but ſuch as are expert in the Cure of Diſeaſes, eſpecially ſuch as are moſt frequent in Armies. They are alſo to be Men of good nature, great honeſty and condeſcenſion, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take pains with the poor as well as the rich. Phyſicians thus qualified may ſo gain the hearts of the Souldiers, that theſe will love and honour them as if they were their Parents.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe the Chirurgeons ought to be learn'd, diſcreet, and affable, ſuch as have been long vers'd, and experienc'd, in all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chirurgery, that can diſtinguiſh well of Diſeaſes, and with prudence make their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereon: They ought alſo to be diligent, and careful of thoſe committed to their charge,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52336:238"/>
and very knowing in all manner of outward applications, as Unguents, Plaiſters, Pulments, Lenitives, Stiptiques, Attractives, Digeſtives, Cauſticks, Eſcharotiques, as alſo their Molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, Diſſipating, Repelling, Suppurating and Mundifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Medicines. They ought to be skilful in diſcerning them, and withal in knowing well the caſes and times where and when to uſe them, They are to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in obſerving the beginning, middle and end of Ulcers, Wounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſince it often may be impertinent and even hurtful too, to uſe that in the beginning, that may be pertinent and beneficial in the midſt of the cure, and the like.</p>
                     <p>An able and dextrous Chirurgeon is a great Treaſure in an Army, and cannot be enough valued, eſpecially if he conſult in all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous caſes with an underſtanding Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two, Phyſitians and Chirurgeons, are to be intimate friends together, aſſiſting one another without envy and pride, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relief and the greater ſafety of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very neceſſary, both theſe ſhould go abroad and travel before they undertake to practiſe, thereby to acquire experience, and to learn alſo to converſe with the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and gentleneſs with all ſorts of humors. And when they come to practiſe, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons ought to adviſe with Phyſitians, who are but lame Doctors, if they be not skilled in Chirurgery; ſince this is the third part of Phyſick, from which it can and ought not to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52336:239"/>
be ſeparated, being an integral part thereof. It is recorded in hiſtory, that above 2000 years ſince, <hi>Podalyrius</hi> and <hi>Machaon,</hi> Sons to <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> went both with <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the Expedition for <hi>Troja,</hi> and there purchaſed great honour by their practiſe not ſo much of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick as Chirurgery.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IV. Of Fevers, Hungarian Diſtempers, Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fevers, and other Peſtilential Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as alſo of Hereditary Maladies, together with their Remedies.</head>
                     <p>'TIs known ſeldom to fail, that in an army there reigneth ſome Diſeaſe or other, according to the nature and conſtitution of the Country, Air, and Diet. The reaſons are;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that amongſt ſo great a number of Men, raiſed from ſo many different places, there are to be found Men of very different tempers and conſtitutions, ſound and unſound; and amongſt the latter, ſome that are ſcabby, others ſcorbutical, others labouring under venereal Diſeaſes, many inclined to dangerous and infectious Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian muſt have a watchful eye upon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent their ſpreading.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> that Souldiers in an Army want conveniences wherewith to take due care of their health; but are often conſtrain'd to expoſe themſelves and ſleep in the open Air
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52336:239"/>
on moiſt ground, the vapours whereof pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into their bodies; and they are careleſs or want oppertunities of expelling them out again by ſweat. Whence is cauſed an inward putrefaction in the blood and humours, which ſometimes proceeds ſo far, as to aſſume a venemous nature, and to break out into ſpots, tumors, bubo's, carbuncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that Souldiers commonly keep an irregular diet. Sometimes they have plenty and do ſupperabound; at other times they have nothing; and then being very hungry, when they come again to a place of plenty, they over-feed and ſurfeit; whence are bred crudities in the Stomach, and corruption, which cauſeth malignant Fevers in abundance. Beſides, they often feed upon Meat that is unwholſom, as ſtinking Veniſon, rotten Cheeſe muſty Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot but occaſion many Diſeaſes. And when they come to places, where Fruit abounds, as Apples, Pears, Plums, Melons, Cherries, Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they over-eat themſelves, and thereby cauſe Gripings in the Guts, <hi>Diarrhaea's, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> ſometimes the Air is corrupted, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after a great Battel, and ſlaughter of Men that remain unburied; whereby the Air being tainted infects the living that take it in. Which is often made worſe by the exhalations of low and mooriſh ground, and by thick Fogs.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the general Cauſes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſtempers reigning in Armies; againſt which thou art to arm thy ſelf accordingly. Firſt then be careful in thy Diet; eat not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52336:240"/>
greedily and indiſcreetly every thing that comes to hand; and though it be good, yet eat and drink not too plentifully of it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain thy appetite, conſidering how deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive every exceſs may be to thy health.</p>
                     <p>If thou canſt and haſt no averſion from it, drink every Morning of thy own <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> which prevents corruption in the Stomach, opens obſtructions in the Liver, Spleen, Meſaraic Veins; which if not removed, there will follow Fevers, the Yellow Jaundice, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and difficulty of breathing. If thou art averſe from doing ſo, eat ſome Bread and Butter with Rue on it; or, if it be not hot weather, take in the morning the quantity of a Haſel-nut of Mithridate or Treacle; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in Brandy, or rather in Spirit of <hi>Juniper-berries,</hi> ſome <hi>Zedoary, Angelica,</hi> and a little <hi>Citron-peels,</hi> and drink a ſpoonful of it in the Morning.</p>
                     <p>When the Air is corrupted, and there be at hand a Goat, rub thy ſelf at him, and let not the ſtrong ſmell keep thee from it. Alſo put Quickſilver in an empty Haſel-nut, cloſed up with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wax, and hang it about thy neck; or the <hi>Zenechton</hi> prepared of <hi>Arſenic,</hi> (after the manner by and by to be deſcribed) ſowed up in thin Leather; for if it ſhould touch the bare skin, it would cauſe Bliſters and do harm. This <hi>Zenechton</hi> is a Plaiſter, out of which are cut pieces of the bigneſs of a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which are carried about the Neck, and hang down near the Heart; keeping good a whole year. And when the infection is paſt, this <hi>Zenechton</hi> being reduced to Powder, will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52336:240"/>
yet ſerve to kill Rats and Mice with. It is to be thus prepar'd,</p>
                     <p>Take of Yellow and White Arſenic, of each an ounce, or ¾ of an ounce; of <hi>gummi Tragacanth</hi> ½ an ounce; put this <hi>gummi</hi> in Roſe-water or in common water over night, and it will yield a ſlimy Water. Then beat thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenic in a Mortar, and put ſo much of this gummed Water to it, as is neceſſary to reduce it to a Paſte having the conſiſtence of Dough; work it well and round it, and then cut off a ſlice of the bigneſs of a Dollar, ſomewhat thicker; let this ſlice dry in the Air, and ſow it in a piece of thin Leather (well-dreſſed Dogs-skin is the beſt for this purpoſe;) carry this about thy Neck ſo as to let it hang down upon, and to touch the place of thy Heart. Some mix with it a proportion of the Powder of dried Toads, which I have done my ſelf, it being eſteem'd more powerful. Some carry about their Necks dried Spiders; <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> commends <hi>Celondine,</hi> Leaves and Root, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about the Neck.</p>
                     <p>Remember alſo to burn frequently <hi>Juniper-wood</hi> before thy Tent; though all ordinary fires cleanſe the Air: Upon which account <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſed great fires to be made in <hi>Greece</hi> at the time of a great Plague, which was thought to have been remov'd by that means. Some burn only a few Chips of Juniper-roots, or ſome of the Berries of that ſhrub, which is as effectual.</p>
                     <p>If theſe means cannot be had, burn ſome Gunpowder, ordering it like a Train; this purifieth the Air likewiſe. And the volleys
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52336:241"/>
of ſhot made mornings and evenings in a Camp, conduce very much to the diſpelling of Miſt, and qualifying raw weather.</p>
                     <p>Frankincenſe alſo, Maſtick, and ſuch other Perfumes as dry and clear the Air, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſefully burnt; and even a Scholars Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume made of waſte <hi>Paper</hi> is not to be deſpiſed.</p>
                     <p>If thou canſt get <hi>Rue,</hi> ſmell often to it: And remember me for this general hint, to take good notice of all Herbs that are green Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer, and which are not eaten by Horſes or Cattel; for they are endow'd with excellent virtues for the good of <hi>Man,</hi> and therefore made to grow at all ſeaſons of the year.</p>
                     <p>When the Air is peſtilential, or breeding any Epidemical Diſeaſe, then waſh thy face with Vinegar every morning. If thou canſt get <hi>Acetum</hi> of Rue, Elder-flowers, Lavender, Roſes, Marigold-flowers, 'tis the better. Or, if you have the conveniency, prepare the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Acetum</hi>: Take Rue, Elder-flowers, Burnet-roots, white Dittany, Carlina, of each equal quantity; a few Orange or Citron-peels, (of which the latter are the better of the two,) and a little Camphire, and ſome Walnut-kernels (the freſher the better,) leaving the bitter skins upon them; put all theſe into common Vinegar, and with this infuſion moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten every morning thy Temples, Mouth and Noſtrils, and the beating Arteries of both thy Wriſts; taking down a good ſpoonful of it, and thou haſt a good preſervative.</p>
                     <p>If it be cold weather, take Angelica-roots, Zedoaria, white Dittany, ſome dried Citron-peels,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52336:241"/>
and a little Camphir, infuſe them all in Brandy, eſpecially in ſuch as is made out of Wormwood or Juniper-berries. Of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor drink in the morning a ſpoonful. But if thou be of a hot conſtitution, then content thy ſelf with the former <hi>Acetum,</hi> in which you may mix a little Treacle.</p>
                     <p>Some adviſe to take faſting ſome of the Juice of Marigold, freſhly expreſs'd out of the Flower and Leaves, as a good preſervative againſt the Infection. This I have not tried; but I have often in ſuch caſes uſed the <hi>Acetum</hi> of Marigold-flowers, eſpecially for a Cordial and Sudorifick, and, I think, with very good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Or make an Electuary of Rue and Juniper-berries, of each equal quantity, adding thereto a double quantity of Walnuts, with their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter skin on them, ſome Figs, a little Treacle, and a little Saffron; beat them together in a Mortar, and pour on them, whilſt thou art beating, as much Rue-vinegar as will reduce it to a thick Puls or Electuary: Of this take the bigneſs of a Haſel-Nut or two, faſting.</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of the greater <hi>Burrdock,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Celondine,</hi> both well cleared, and the Bark of Aſh; infuſe them twenty four hours in half White-wine, and half Rue-vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; then diſtil it, and in the diſtilled water mix a little Brimſtone-oyl, to render it a little ſowriſh. Of this take two ſpoonfuls in the morning for a preſervative. But if any be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready infected with the Plague, let him take of the ſame ſix or eight ſpoonfuls at a time, and ſweat upon it, it being a very ſudorifick
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52336:242"/>
Liquor, which, under the name of <hi>Aqua Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dana compoſita,</hi> hath been uſed by me and my Collegues in Hoſpitals and other places with very great ſucceſs. You may mix ſome Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date with it, if you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>Elſe take <hi>Carlina, Imperatoria, Serpentaria, Valerian, Saxifrage, Tormentil, Gentian, Angelica</hi> and <hi>Zedoaria,</hi> all cut ſmall; infuſe them in Brandy, and drink of it a ſpoonful in the morning for a preſervative; but if thou haſt the Contagion, take <hi>two</hi> ſpoonfuls, to ſweat upon it, in caſe the Peſtilential Poiſon be not yet broken out, and the Patients Tongue not dry; but if it be, content thy ſelf with the newly preſcribed <hi>Acetum,</hi> as being more ſafe, and an Inflammation being to be feared from the Brandy.</p>
                     <p>Hold <hi>Zedoar, Angelica, Lovage</hi> or <hi>Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> in thy mouth; but if thou be ſubject to the Head-ach, then cut it firſt ſmall, and infuſe it in Vinegar, and let it ſtand infuſed for the ſpace of 24 hours; then take it out again, dry it, and uſe it as preſcribed above.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the good <hi>Preſervatives</hi> reckon this alſo: Take <hi>Garden-rue,</hi> beat it into a mortar, pour Vinegar on it, and ſtrain all through a cloth; mix ſome Treacle with it, ſet it by in a glaſs, and take of it in the morning half a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or a whole. Put a little Camphir to it, if you will have it ſtronger.</p>
                     <p>Or put Camphir in Worm-wood-wine, and drink a good draught of it every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</p>
                     <p>When I ſerved in times of great mortality, I infuſed in Wine <hi>Carduus benedictus, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52336:242"/>
Scordium, Dictamne</hi> of <hi>Creet, Burnet-roots,</hi> and <hi>Citron-peels,</hi> and after I had taken every morning a good meſs of ſouriſh broth, I drank after it a good glaſs of this infuſion. As long as the herbs retain a bitterneſs, freſh wine may be infuſed upon them.</p>
                     <p>Infuſe alſo white and well cleanſed <hi>Garlick</hi> in <hi>Acetum</hi> made of Rue, and take of it a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or two in the morning.</p>
                     <p>In the Apothecary-ſhops are Pills, call'd <hi>Peſtilential Pills:</hi> Among theſe cauſe a little Camphir to be mixt, and of it let Pills be made; of which take at once three or four every week, taking them in a ſpoonful of White-wine, an hour before ſupper. Theſe prevent all inward putrefaction, and keep off all infection, nor do they ſuffer any collection, of morbifique matter within thee, though they purge not, but only keep the body ſoluble. They are made up of Aloe Myrrhe and Saffron. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I have printed a whole Book of ſuch Pills, which I call'd <hi>Marocoſtinas</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi>; where I have deſcribed their vertues at large.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Rich</hi> may ſerve what follows; Take <hi>Terra Sigillata, Bolus Armenus, Pulvis Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macus,</hi> or <hi>Bezoardicum Nicolai,</hi> or the <hi>Cordiales Alexandrini Benedicti</hi>; item <hi>Species de Hyacin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho, Aqua Stapediana, Acetum Theriacale,</hi> or the <hi>Red Hungarian Powder</hi>; all theſe ſerving not only to preſerve, but alſo to recover, by Gods bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Provide out of the Apothecaries-ſhops Paſtils of the extract of <hi>Angelica</hi> or <hi>Zedoaria</hi>; take one or two of them in thy mouth every morning, and there let them melt down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:52336:243"/>Keep thy body clean every way; be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; avoid raſhneſs; nor be affraid, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many have been infected by fear, terrour, and melancholy. Chear thy ſelf up now and then with a glaſs of good and ſincere Wine, but not to exceſs. <hi>Never faſting,</hi> nor <hi>never full.</hi> One that is empty will ſoon be caught with this diſtemper, eſpecially if he live amongſt infected people. If he do, let him drink a good draught of Wormwood-wine, Juniper-berry-wine, Roſemary, Sage, or Zedoar-wine; which may keep thee from many dangers. But remember, not to drink more of it than will chear thee up and revive thy Spirits. At leaſt, drink a little Wine with Camphir and Vinegar, kindling the Camphir and letting it burn in the Wine, ſo as to let it ſink into it; for if it burn on the top, it will there remain ſwimming: And if the Wine be skinned over with it, kindle it again till it be quite burnt out. Take of Camphir for one draught, the quantity of a peaſe; but if thou be ſubject to the Head-ach, then Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir will not agree with thee.</p>
                     <p>In caſe that any come to be infected, he is forthwith to be ſeparated from the ſound, and to be laid to bed, ſo as his head and ſhoulders may lye ſomewhat high; by which means he will be leſs ſubject to faintneſs. Then let him preſently take ſome Sudorifick Medicine, to make him ſweat; for if the poyſon be not ſpeedily driven from the heart, the Patient is loſt. You are alſo to take great care, that this Diſtemper prevail not, and to endeavour to diſcover it before the Patient be quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52336:243"/>
For, as ſoon as any begins to droop, grows melancholy, faint and feeble in his limbs, ſo as that he is hardly able to hold up his head, drawing his breath with difficulty, letting his head fall to and fro, loſing his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, growing yellowiſh about his eyes, with the apples of his eyes ſtanding out, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing head-ach, interrupted heats and colds; as ſoon, <hi>I ſay,</hi> as theſe ſymptoms appear in times of the Plague, Spotted Fevers, Hungarian Diſeaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may then look to it by times; foraſmuch as ſuch Patients, that are already infected, go often about until the ſixth or eighth day, as I have known my ſelf, until the lurking poyſon of the heart has got the prevalency; and then the poor Patient is quite caſt down, and often dyes in very few days, and even in a few hours. Wherefore thou art not to ſtay, till the ſwellings and boils appear behind the ears, under the arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or till the Carbuncles, Bubo's, and the like, break out; but thou art immediately to make uſe of the beſt Medicines, thou canſt be Maſter of, to drive out the poyſon, if thou wilt ſave thy life. I never found any thing, that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, done in the Plague, by means of Purging and Bleeding; but rather on the contrary, all thoſe that had Spots, if they were Purged or let Blood, ſoon after died. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I will preſcribe nothing magiſterially to any man; let every one endeavour to do, what he can give a good account of. I have, together with my Collegues, treated many hundreds in our Hoſpitals infected with the Plague, without ever opening a Vein, and

yet we have by Gods bleſſing recovered near 600 perſons, beſides thoſe that by the ſame mercy we have cured in their ſeveral Houſes.</p>
                     <p>Now to procure ſweat in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, take the quantity of two Haſel-nuts of Treacle, diſſolve it in common Vinegar; but if thou canſt have a cordial <hi>Acetum,</hi> made of Roſemary, Lavender, Elder-bloſſoms, Rue, Roſes, or Elder-berries, uſe it much rather, and give it the Patient to ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Or take the roots of <hi>Celondine,</hi> boyl them in Vinegar, and diſſolve ſome Treacle in it: Or take <hi>Carduus benedictus, Rue, Petaſites</hi> or <hi>Butter-burr,</hi> a little <hi>Angelica, Zedoaria,</hi> or <hi>Saxifrage-roots,</hi> boyl them together in half White-wine, and half Vinegar, or only Water, diſſolve a little Treacle or Mithridate in it, and let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient take it warm, to make him ſweat.</p>
                     <p>Mithridate hath the like virtue with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, yet neither of them are ſafe to take for Women with Child, old Perſons and young Children.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo make uſe to good purpoſe of the Saxon-powder, taking of it the weight of a Ducat in <hi>Caduus benedictus, Scabius,</hi> or <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel-water</hi>; which Powder is thus to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared:</p>
                     <p>Take <hi>Valerian</hi> half an ounce; <hi>Celondine,</hi> or <hi>Nettel-roots,</hi> of each one ounce; <hi>Polypody, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaea,</hi> (or <hi>Marchmallow,</hi>) wild <hi>Angelica,</hi> of each two ounces; of garden <hi>Angelica,</hi> four ounces; of the rind of <hi>Laureola,</hi> (or <hi>Lowry,</hi>) an ounce and an half: Theſe roots are to be dug up in their beſt ſtrength, <hi>viz.</hi> between the middle of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and the middle of <hi>September,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52336:254"/>
cleanſed, they are to be cut ſmall, and then put in a glazed pot, pouring a ſharp Vinegar upon it, ſo as to cover it two inches high. Then lute on the cover with a lute made of whites of Eggs and Flower; let all be boiled upon a gentle fire; then pour off the liquor, and dry the roots, and reduce them to powder, mixing with it ſome 26 berries of <hi>Herbe Paris,</hi> (or <hi>One-Berrie</hi> (which look like Pepper-corns, very good againſt poiſon; and thus the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is made. This herb grows in ſhadowed and moderately moiſt places; I have found of it ſeveral times in <hi>Koſhinger-wood</hi> near <hi>Ingolſtad</hi>: It hath four leaves on one ſtalk, and one berry on the top. An herb belonging to the family of <hi>Solanum's</hi> or <hi>Night ſhades</hi>; whence the leaves of it do very much cool Inflammations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the Eyes, when laid upon them.</p>
                     <p>Take notice of <hi>Sorrel,</hi> bruiſe ſome of it and pour Vinegar on't, (the <hi>Rue acetum</hi> is the beſt,) and ſtrain the juice through a cloth; put into it a little powder of <hi>Angelica,</hi> about the weight of half a Ducat; or of the root of <hi>Dictam,</hi> or of Butter-burr, or a little Treacle or Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, and give it to ſweat.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion of mentioning <hi>Dictam,</hi> I muſt add, that in our Countrey there grows only the white <hi>Dictam,</hi> which is, among others, an excellent Antidote, but you muſt take of it the double quantity and weight to that of <hi>Creta.</hi> You may boil of the root of half an ounce in half White-wine and half Vinegar, or, inſtead of the Wine, in <hi>Carduus benedictus</hi> water; and drink of the Decoction warm, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52336:255"/>
put your ſelf to ſweat; or take of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it a drachm and an half in warm broth with a little Vinegar, for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dictam</hi> of <hi>Creta</hi> hath hairy leaves and purpureous bloſſoms, and is uſed in the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Treacle. This herb by its odour drives away Serpents. The wild Goats being hurt by any Arrows eat this herb, and 'tis ſaid, that by this means the Arrows fall out of the wound. This perhaps hath no other ground than that of the Poet <hi>Virgil,</hi> affirming that <hi>Venus</hi> with this herb healed her Son <hi>Aeneas</hi> when wounded in the War. His words are <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 12.

                     <p>About this time came in the Hungarian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which was a Diſeaſe that bred ſuch a a putrefaction in the bodies of Men, that even when they were near death, they fell a vomiting but that with ſuch a ſtench, that no body could endure it. Here thoſe Medicines do well, that preſerve the body from putrefaction; for the Plague, Spotted Fevers, and the Hungarian Diſtemper, proceed all from inward corruption. And of them, the <hi>Plague</hi> attacks the Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the Heart, and ſo killeth very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; whereas <hi>Spotted Fevers</hi> have their ſeat in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52336:255"/>
the Blood, and therefore do laſt twelve, fourteen, and ſometimes twenty days before they kill. But the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Diſeaſe is ſeated chiefly in the putrified Phlegm of the Head and Brains; whence thoſe that labour under it, are torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great and maniacal head-ach.</p>
                     <p>But though theſe three Diſeaſes have their riſe from one and the ſame cauſe (<hi>Putrefaction,</hi>) and are to be cured by the ſame remedies; yet is therein required the diſcretion of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Phyſitian, for the ordering and preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Medicines according to circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p>Take a drachm of <hi>Zedoary,</hi> give it pulveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Patient in <hi>Acetum</hi> of Rue, or Elder, or Marrigold flowers, or even in common Vinegar: Let him ſweat upon it. 'Tis good againſt all ſorts of venom, and cauſeth a ſweet breath, as reſiſting inward corruption.</p>
                     <p>In the Apothecary Shops you find an Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, called <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> found by that famous Phyſician <hi>Hieronymus Fracaſtorius.</hi> It is like to Treacle and Mithridate; only 'tis red from ſome Ingredients giving it that colour. This may be uſed with ſafety by Women with Child, young Children and all ſorts of Perſons, whereas, as was ſaid above, Treacle and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate may not. It is made chiefly of <hi>Scordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> or <hi>Water-Germander,</hi> which hath the ſmell of Leek when bruiſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Galen</hi> in his firſt Book <hi>De Antidotis, Chap.</hi> 12. writeth, that when in a great Battel ſome ſlain Bodies chanced to fall upon this Herb, they rotted not as far as they were touched by this Herb.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52336:256"/>The ſaid <hi>Fracaſtorius</hi> did compound this his <hi>Diaſcordium</hi> out of this Herb <hi>Scordium, Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, Serpentaria, Gentian, Bole Armeniac</hi> and <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> and ſuch like Ingredients.</p>
                     <p>It is chiefly to be uſed in the hot Diſeaſes of the Head; which I have done many a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times. Take of it the weight of about two ducats in common Vinegar, or in Elder-water, or rather in the expreſſed Juyce of freſh Sorrel, and ſweat upon it. 'Tis very good eſpecially in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Sickneſs and other venomous and infectious Diſeaſes. To young People you may give a leſſer quantity, and proportionably you are to leſſen the Doſe for Women with Child or in Child bed, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children.</p>
                     <p>Beſides take notice of the Powder of Doctor <hi>Heſſius,</hi> which hath been uſed with great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and is thus prepared.</p>
                     <p>Take a drachm of Sugar-candy, a quarter of an ounce of pulveriſed Ginger, and a drachm of Camphir; reduce all to a fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; give of it to the infected Patient the weight of a drachm in Vinegar mingled with the Water of Marigold flowers, Scabious or Sorrel, and ſweat upon it. If you have none of theſe Waters, then look that the Vinegar be not too ſharp, and to that end dilute it with ſome Wine and Water. Mean time, though in this caſe I highly value Camphir, yet in ſtead of Ginger I would uſe Zedoary, Saxifrage, Carlina or Imperatoria, or the true <hi>Petaſites</hi> or Butter-burr.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Brimſtone</hi> is none of the meaneſt Remedies in theſe infectious caſes; for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52336:256"/>
the Body from Putrefaction. Wherefore take of the noble Flowers of Sulphur a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ounce, being ſublimed from Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar; add to it one ſcruple of Camphir, an ounce of the Spirit or Oyl of Cyprian or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Turpentine. Put all this into a Glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, lute it well and put it upon hot Sand or Aſhes, whereby the Oyl of Turpentine will come to open the Brimſtone, and produce a red colour like a Ruby, or at leaſt as yellow as a high-colour'd Hyacinth. Of this give ſome to the Patient three or four times, mingled with a little Treacle, or in Sorrel, Cardobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus, or Scabious-water. This Balſom is excellent alſo in ſore Breaſts that are growing purulent, taken in warm broth, or in a good Wound-drink. But this muſt be in caſes of no great heat or inflammation, in which it would be dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt all the Remedies, which ſerve againſt Infectious Diſeaſes, that of <hi>Henricus Stapedius,</hi> to be found in my Book <hi>de Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> is an excellent one, and perhaps the beſt for curing as well as preſerving; of which half a ſpoonful being taken faſting, is able to keep a Man well for twelve hours or more: But if any be already infected, he muſt take of it at any time immediately, to the quantity of a ſpoonful and an half, or two ſpoonfuls, for ſweating. Which is to be repeated every eighteen or twenty four hours, to make the Patient ſweat, till he recover, or till the Peſtilential Boyls and Carbuncles break out behind the Ears, under the Arms, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. This Water, though it be ſomewhat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52336:257"/>
dear, yet its vertue countervails its price. The older it grows the more vertue it hath.</p>
                     <p>Many have aſcribed great efficacy to the Blood of Animals: Thus old <hi>Democritus,</hi> (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Galen,</hi>) prepared an Electuary of ſuch Blood, called <hi>Diathaematôn.</hi> Some eſteem much the Blood of <hi>Storks,</hi> becauſe they eat Toads and Snakes; others value the Blood of Hens, becauſe they eat Spiders and other venomous Inſects. I ſhould eſteem moſt the Fleſh or Blood of Badgers; which is to be dried in the ſhade, and that done, you muſt mix with it Saffron, Camphir, and ſome or other of the Anti-peſtilential Roots, as of Angelica, Zedoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, or the like, together with a little live Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to the quantity of a ducat; which is to be taken in <hi>Acetuni</hi> of Rue, or Marigold-flowers, or Walnuts, and in caſe of want of theſe, in common Vinegar: Upon which the Patient is to ſweat. If thou art a good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, have ready a good <hi>Acetum</hi> of Rue, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-kernels and Marigold-flowers, taking the greater quantity of Rue; and as you uſe it, fill it up again with <hi>Acetum</hi> of Elder-berries.</p>
                     <p>The Rich do uſe for their Phyſick in the time of the Plague, the red Hungarian, as alſo the Imperial red and gray Powder, Bezoar, Harts-horn, <hi>Antidotum Matthioli, Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Bole Armeniack, Scorzonera</hi> and <hi>Contrayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, Species de Gemmis, Diamargariton de Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cintho,</hi> and other high Medicines, of which I have largely diſcourſed in my above-cited Book <hi>De Poſtilentia.</hi> But I, though I have uſed ſuch Remedies among the Rich, yet I content my ſelf commonly with the plainer
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52336:257"/>
and moſt common Medicines, of which I have more knowledge and experience.</p>
                     <p>The Pickle of <hi>Ebulus</hi> or Walwort, (<hi>alias</hi> Dane-wort, or Dwarf-elder,) which is of kin to Elder; as alſo the Pickle of Juniper-berries, are alſo of great uſe in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>The Phyſicians of <hi>Ausburg</hi> made great uſe, in the year 1572. of the red Imperial Powder; the compoſition of which is in the <hi>Auguſtan Diſpenſatory</hi> at large, as alſo in my Book <hi>de Peſte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are the ſeveral means to provoke ſweat, which I eſteem to be of great efficacy for that purpoſe upon a ſudden. And though Souldiers have not the conveniency of a Bed for ſweating, when they are in a march, and often cannot put off their Cloaths for many nights together; yet let them uſe ſuch ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick means: for, though they cannot ſweat outright, yet they may fall into a dampiſh moiſture, which if it ſtrike not in again, may prove as good as a ſweat. Yet in this caſe he muſt turn his Shirt: <hi>Quod non facit ſudor, praeſtat id tenuis udor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here is to be noted, that 'tis not enough, once only to give a ſudorifick Medicine to an infected Body; conſidering that the venom, like a raging Sea, is toſſed to and fro every way. And though it ſhould ſeem to thee, as if by thy approved Antidote thou hadſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Diſeaſe, the ſymptoms of it excepted, yet thou art not to truſt in this caſe; for I my ſelf have been ſometimes deceived, and hard put to it to make good what by confidence I had omitted. Wherefore you muſt not truſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52336:258"/>
to the <hi>once</hi> taking a ſudorifick Potion or Powder, becauſe ſuch malign and lurking Diſeaſes, that keep no ſtitch, do indeed fly the firſt time from thy Medicament, and hide themſelves under it, but they are wont ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to re-appear. Wherefore you muſt repeat the Antidotes, that were firſt adminiſtred to you, for the time of 16, 18, 20, or 24 hours, according to circumſtances, and ſo long and often, till you judge your ſick Brothers or Friends Heart ſecured from the infectious Venom.</p>
                     <p>When the ſweating is over, thou muſt then refreſh thy Patient, firſt by drying him well, and next by giving him a little Vinegar to taſte in a ſpoon. The Rich may afford ſome ſlices of Citron, of which <hi>Theopompus Chius</hi> writeth, that the Tyrant <hi>Clearchus Heracleota,</hi> who lived in <hi>Pontus,</hi> having poiſoned many People, the vertue of Citron was at length found out, of which a ſlice being eaten pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an effectual Antidote againſt it. The ſame vertue may be found in a ſlice of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apple; and the <hi>Syrupus de Pomis</hi> is one of the Cordials of our ſhops.</p>
                     <p>But the thirſt, that uſes to follow upon ſweating, will not be quenched with ſo ſmall a matter; wherefore take three parts of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one part of Vinegar, and, if the Patient be not too hot, one part of Wine, mixing ſome Sugar therewith, and of this let him drink a good draught, and it will cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, take ſome of the guts of Hens, and ſome ſlices of Radiſh, ſprinkle them with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52336:258"/>
Vinegar and Salt, and bind them to the ſoles of his feet; this will draw away the heat. But let not the Radiſh lye too long upon them, becauſe it will give a ſtink that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the head-ach, wherewith the People that have the Plague are commonly troubled enough without provoking it. Moreover you will do well to tye about his wriſts ſome Rue beaten with Vinegar. Anoint his Loyns and Back-bone with the Unguent of Roſes, or with freſh Butter; but if there appear any Spots, forbear to anoint him, leſt they ſhould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in.</p>
                     <p>You will do well to have <hi>Epithemata</hi> of good things about you, as of Roſe water and Elder-vinegar, to lay over the Heart; with which mix ſome Camphir. But if you find any thing of Specks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> broke out, you muſt uſe no wet thing.</p>
                     <p>Anoint his Heart with Oyl of Scorpions, take the Oyl of Sea-bloſſoms and of thoſe Earth-worms that appear after rain, of each ſix ounces, of St <hi>Johns</hi>-wort Oyl two ounces, of freſh Elder-bloſſoms and Rue, each a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an half, of the <hi>Acetum,</hi> of Marigold-flowers and Roſes, each about three ounces, of live Spiders forty five: Boil all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the Vinegar be ſo qualified, that when 'tis thrown into the fire, it cauſe no cracking there. Then ſtrain it, and in this ſtrained Oyl put a matter of five and twenty Spiders more, of the biggeſt ſort, and add to it of Camphir diſſolved in the Spirit of Roſes half a drachm; let it ſtand in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> or upon hot embers for twelve hours, and then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52336:259"/>
put to it of Treacle and Mithridate, of each half an ounce, and let them work together. With this Oyl anoint the eight Pulſes, <hi>viz.</hi> both Temples, behind both Ears, both Hands, and both Knees, as alſo the Heart. And this is an excellent <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to Scorpion-oyl, much uſed by the <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, you muſt refreſh and ſtrengthen the Patient with convenient Meat and Drink; I mean with good Fleſh or Barley-broath, with a little Vinegar in it to make it ſavoury to him who will have appetite to little elſe, till he have ſhaken off this venomous Diſtemper; which when he hath done, his ſtomach will be ſo keen, that you will find work enough to keep him from ſurfeiting.</p>
                     <p>Be alſo careful to keep thy Patients Body open; if he be obſtructed, uſe a Cliſter, or take Butter or Hogs-greaſe, mixing a little Salt with it, or, if it be to be gotten, a little Mice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickles, and put it into his bowels. Phyſick at the mouth for this purpoſe is not always ſafe: When the Patient is diſcharged of the venom, a little liquor of ſtew'd Prunes with ſome Senna-leaves in it will do well for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body. Some freſh Butter eaten in the morning, or melted in warm Broath, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, is wont alſo to keep the body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble.</p>
                     <p>The Drink of theſe Patients may be, Water with ſome Bread ſoaked in it; or take of ſuch Water, wherein Bread hath been ſoaked, one quart, and a little Vinegar, with two or three ſpoonfuls of Kitchin-ſugar, mingling it well together. If you have no Sugar, uſe ſuch Water
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52336:259"/>
with Vinegar alone: This affords good Drink in malignant Fevers. Among the <hi>Romans</hi> it was drunk by the Souldiers, under the name of <hi>Poſca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may alſo take a handful of well cleaned Plantain-roots, and boil them up in three quarts of Water, and then decant the Water, which though it be ſomewhat bitter, yet 'tis very good in Fevers, and a good Drink in hot Diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>If you have Oyl of Vitriol, let a few drops of it fall into clear Water, mingling it well; and you will have a factitious <hi>Sawer-brun</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidula.</hi> But uſe no Metalline Veſſel for this purpoſe. With this kind of Water many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been ſerved in all ſorts of Fevers; the Oyl of Vitriol, in ſuch Diſtempers, if rightly uſed, being very beneficial.</p>
                     <p>But if a Man ſhould have with it any Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Diſeaſe, in that caſe he muſt forbear acid things, and uſe Liquorice, and content himſelf with Ptiſane. Nor is it at all good to uſe acids in Peſtilential Pleuriſies.</p>
                     <p>And ſince on this occaſion we mention this caſe, and we having above given warning, not eaſily to blood in Peſtilential Diſeaſes; yet may Venae-ſection be ſometimes, upon good conſideration, uſed in that <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> provided it be done in the very beginning, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be ſtrong and full of Blood. Yet this is not to leſſen the blood, but only to give it vent; but before bleeding the Patient is to ſweat by taking ſome of the above ſpecified Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient have violent Head-ach, lay on his head Vine-leaves or freſh Cabbage-leaves;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52336:260"/>
and, if you have no Alablaſter-ſalve, take two parts of Vinegar, and one part of Oyl of Olives (the Sea-bloſſoms Oyl, and Elder-Vinegar were better;) dip long rags of linnen therein, and having well ſqueez'd them again, lay them lukewarm over the face and temples. Even Vinegar alone is good. Of ſuch Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you may make many, of <hi>Acetum</hi> of Roſes, Elder-bloſſoms, and the like, with a little Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir. The expreſſed Milk of Peaches is alſo very effectual in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>If at the going off of this Diſtemper, a hot defluxion ſhould fall into the Eyes, take Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir and infuſe it in water, and often moiſten the Eyes therewith; and if it ſhould be cold and windy weather, you will do well to keep your ſelf out of the open Air, and not to let this water dry up in your Eyes in the cold wind.</p>
                     <p>In caſe of having loſt thy hearing, take of thy own Urine, and with it waſh thy Ears within, but withal dry them very well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that moiſture is very noxious to the Ears: And it often happens, that after the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sickneſs People grow deaf or hard of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Others put the water of <hi>Carduus-benedictus</hi> diſtilled with Wine into the Ears, or the Oyl of bitter Almonds.</p>
                     <p>If thy Throat ſwell, or the Palate of thy Mouth be fallen down, gargarize thy Throat with warm Milk, wherein Figgs have been boil'd, or ſweetned with Sugar. The Flowers of <hi>Phyllirea</hi> or <hi>Mock-privet,</hi> which grows in the Hedges, boiled, and uſed for a gargariſm, heals alſo a ſore Throat. The ſame doth the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52336:260"/>
middle rind of <hi>Oxyacantha</hi> or <hi>Haw-thorn,</hi> if boiled, with a little Allom diſſolved in the Decoction. If you have the Juice of Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, mix a little Honey of Roſes with it, and often take a little thereof. The Roots of Sloes boiled in red Wine, and the Mouth often waſhed therewith, is alſo very good.</p>
                     <p>If thou haſt the Squinancy, boil Scabious in Meath, and drink thereof warm, when ſtrain'd. Beat Turnips and fry them in Butter or Oyl, and clap them in a cloth round about thy Neck.</p>
                     <p>If thou caſt up blood, take Mouſe-ear, Ground-Ivy, Cumfrey; boil them in half Wine and half Water, or in Meat, and Drink often of it. But if the Plague reign not, open firſt a Vein.</p>
                     <p>For a violent Cough, boil white Turnips, well cleanſed in common water; throw away this firſt water, pour on other water, and in it let the Turnips boil till they grow ſoft. Strain this water, ſweeten it with Sugar, or infuſe in it Liquorice cut ſmall; and drink of it mornings and evenings warm. Or make a Decoction of <hi>St. Johns bread,</hi> and drink it, abſtaining from all four and ſalt things.</p>
                     <p>The bleeding at the Noſe is alſo incident to perſons infected; which is no good ſign, though in ſound perſons it often frees from the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach and cools the Liver. If this bleeding be too violent, clap Ice-cold water about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients Neck, or let him put his <hi>Pudenda</hi> in cold Vinegar.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. Of the Inflammation of the Tongue, its riſe, and concomitants, together with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</head>
                     <p>WHen the Tongue is inflamed, the whole <hi>Oeſophagus</hi> or Weaſand is inflamed alſo, and this from beneath upward, becauſe the inward fire ſends up its ſmoak all along, as it were, that chimney, which like ſoot ſticks to it, drying and blackning the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But there is another Inflammation, much more dangerous, which taking its riſe about the Heart, and therefore is call'd the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Heart, which proceeds from the great inflammation of the orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ſituate near the heart, in which is inſerted the ſixth pair of Nerves, which maketh the ſaid orifice very ſenſible of any pain. This part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeized by ſo great an inflammation, which is venomous withal, it muſt in a manner harden, and ſhrink; and this heat is of that extent that, the inner Membrane of the Stomach &amp; that of the Tongue being one and the ſame, what befalls the Stomach, the Tongue muſt needs be ſenſible of it. Whence it comes to paſs, that if the Gall overflows and paſſeth into the Stomach, the Tongue preſently finds the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of it: or if the Stomach be full of ſlime or foul, or the like, the Tongue is ſoon affected therewith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52336:261"/>There is another kind of Inflammation, by the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Prunella alba.</hi> This is of the ſame kind with the reſt, but not of the ſame degree; for 'tis not of ſo dry a nature, as the others are, but commonly is moiſt, yet overlays all the Gums, the Throat, and the Weaſand with ſuch a tough white ſlime, like a kind of Leather, and ſo covers the Almonds with the ſame, that ſometimes it can hardly be removed even with Inſtruments. The Tongue is as if it were cruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with dough, the Gums like an Oven that by the heat of fire is burnt white, the Almonds cover'd as 'twere with white leather, and the Palate of the Mouth likewiſe. And in this caſe if the Patient will ſpeak, he lalls and ſtutters, his Tongue being burthen'd with a load of ſlime; or, if he make his Tongue wagg, the ſlime ſpins out like a thred, and ſo invades the Teeth as if they were laid over with var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. And when this varniſh on the Teeth grows black (as I have often obſerv'd it to do) and drieth on them, 'tis a mortal ſign; of which <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quibus in febribus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vores circumdentes naſcuntur, his fortes fiunt febres,</hi> 4. <hi>Aph.</hi> 53.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the three ſorts of Inflammation; for which let us now ſeek out the Remedies, beginning from the laſt, the <hi>White.</hi> This is not to be maſter'd by gargariſins alone, but the hand muſt be employed alſo. Take therefore Cotton-wooll, or Flax, and wind it about a ſtick or rod, and dip this in Vinegar, and rake his Throat and Gums therewith, yet taking care not to make it raw; let him gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſe between, and waſh well his Mouth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52336:262"/>
with Water and Vinegar, or Mul-berry-juyce. <hi>Privet</hi> that grows in the hedges, or the middle rind of <hi>Haw-thorn,</hi> boiled in Water and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vinegar, then ſtrained, with a little Sal-armoniack put into it, is in this caſe an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gargariſm; but if there be bliſters upon the Tongue, or elſewhere, then take inſtead of Sal-armoniack a little unburnt Allom, and mix it therewith. If you can have the Juyce of Turnips, or the Juyce of freſh Houſe-leek, diſſolve therein alſo a little Sal-armoniack, and uſe it to wet the ſtick, wherewith thou cleanſeſt the Throat of the Patient; dipping it often therein, and carrying it about the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vula</hi> or Palate of the Mouth; and you will ſee lumps come away as big as Peaſe. The skin is under this <hi>Prunella alba</hi> fair and red, but ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Whilſt thou art cleanſing the Patients Mouth, let him often gargariſe with the Waters above-ſpecified, and he will clear his Mouth of the looſen'd lumps. If thou canſt get Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-juyce mixt with Honey of Roſes, the Mouth will heal the better; for upon this ſort of Inflammation there uſually follows a Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Mouth; and in caſe thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt any ſuch thing, take Wood-ſorrel, and the above ſaid rind of Haw-thorn, make a Decoction of it, and put in it a little Allom, and often gargariſe with it. Clean thy Teeth from the ſlime with Water well ſharpned with Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>The common Inflammation of the Mouth may be cured with frequent waſhing of the Mouth, taking a gargariſm made of Houſe-leek, Lettice, Night-ſhade, or Self-heal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52336:262"/>
mixing a little Honey of Roſes and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-juyce with it. Of this gargariſm the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is alſo to ſwallow a little, thereby to moiſten the Throat.</p>
                     <p>Some take Houſe-leek, and beat it, and put to a pound of it half an ounce of Sal-armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, mixing it well together. And ſo they put it for ſome days in an earthen pot glaſed under ground; then they diſtill of it a Water in <hi>Balneo</hi> or in Sand: Which is excellent both to drink and to gargariſe, though the Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack make it a little unpleaſant.</p>
                     <p>But there is nothing better to allay this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation than Niter; which is ſo well known amongſt Souldiers, that they are wont to give one another Gunpowder to drink, which Powder performs this effect not upon the account of the Coals or Brimſtone, but the Saltpeter.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe Experienced Phyſitians and Chirurgeons endeavour to purifie Niter for this uſe, that it may have the greater effect; and this they do in manner following:</p>
                     <p>They take of the pureſt Niter they can get, as much as they think fit; they beat it to a fine powder, and melt it in a large Crucible, &amp; whilſt it boils up and foameth, they pour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it a little powdered Sulphur, and ſo let it boil together, till the blew Sulphur-flame ceaſeth; then they caſt in more freſh Sulphur: Which they repeat often, and then pour out the Niter into an earthen veſſel glaſed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lozenges of it, of which they put one pulveriſed into a quart of limpid water, and ſo give the Patient to drink of it as much as he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52336:263"/>
needs to quench his thirſt. Or they give of this purified Niter to their Patients, labouring under this Inflammation, the quantity of a ducat or half a ducat weight in Broath, or in Ptiſan, till they find the Tongue cleared of its ſlime.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of Salt-petre thus prepared remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth alſo the Inflammation of the Heart, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be melted upon Lead, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with as before. For Lead is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable cooler, of which cooling quality the Niter, whilſt it is melting upon it, taketh in not a little. Let then your Lead melt, and when 'tis melted, diſſolve the Niter upon it, and then, to purifie it, caſt ſome Brimſtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as was ſaid above, till it be cleanſed from all impurity; and then give of it to thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient two or three times a day, according as need ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe, take live Crafiſhes and freſh Houſleek, beat them together in a Mortar, ſqueeze out the Juyce, with it mix a little Sal-Armoniack, or a pretty deal of thy prepared Niter; make a Potion of it, and give of it even cold to thy Patient, repeating this ſeveral times, every eight or ten hours once, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you ſhall ſee occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Or, take freſh Lard, (if it be ſalted, draw it through hot Water to unſalt it,) and cut a ſlice of it two fingers large, and of the thickneſs of a knives back; put this into the Mouth of thy Patient, it is an excellent Remedy againſt this Inflammation; of which I ſhall give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereafter. I have ſeen wonders done with it. But if thy Patient do rave, then faſten this ſlice of Lard with a Thred and Needle to his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52336:263"/>
Shirt or Doublet, leſt he ſwallow it. Or take freſh Butter, and put it in cold Water, and of it give thy Patient at a time the quantity of a Haſel-nut to hold it upon his Tongue, and let it melt there; which will keep the Tongue always moiſt. And if thou work among this Butter ſome of thy prepared Niter, it hath a wonderful effect, though the taſte be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
                     <p>I promiſed above to explain the Reaſon of the Cure of theſe Inflammations. When you take a Gargariſm of the Waters of <hi>Night-ſhade, Wood-ſorrel, Knot-graſs, Endive, Houſleek,</hi> and the like, mingled with Vinegar, you do well, but this is not enough; the reaſon is: If you wet a piece of Leather, you make it indeed limber, but when it comes to be dry, it grows hard and ſhrinks, except you greaſe it over with ſome fatty matter, and then it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſmooth. So it is with the Tongue; though it be made clean with Gargariſms, yet will it become again rough and untoward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome fatneſs be uſed: For which cauſe I have directed to uſe Lard, or Butter mixt with Niter.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Almonds</hi> be ſwelled, thou muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all ſowre things, and prepare a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſm of Figgs, St. <hi>Johns</hi> Bread, Mallows-flowers, Liquorice, Elder-canes, mixing with it ſome Roſe-honey, or Juyce of Walnuts, or the <hi>Rob Diamorom,</hi> gargling often with it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this ſymptom is a dangerous thing; for when the Throat ſwells of it, few Patients do eſcape death, eſpecially if it be a Peſtilential Squinancy. And in caſe there appear any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52336:264"/>
outwardly, take fine Flower, Milk and Saffron, making a Pulſe of it; and, to keep it from growing hard, mix with it <hi>Althea-ſalve,</hi> or <hi>Hounds-tongue-ſalve,</hi> the Oyl of <hi>blew Violets, Mullein, white Lillies, Camomile,</hi> or the like, adding a little Oyl of Scorpions to it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this outwardly.</p>
                     <p>Make alſo a Scraper of <hi>Alder-wood,</hi> if it may be had; if not, other wood will ſerve, though <hi>Alder</hi> be beſt. Throw it into cold Water, and let it lye there, uſing it as often as there is need; yet take heed of making thy Tongue ſore or raw.</p>

                     <p>IN Camps there is nothing more frequent than Fevers of the Stomach, ariſing from ill Dyet, which Souldiers are often put to for want of better, eating what they can get, Cheeſe, Herbs, Fleſh half boiled, ſtale and muſty Bread, and the like. Hence is gather'd a morbifick matter in the Stomach, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth putrefaction, and conſequently Stomach-fevers.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe thou art firſt to purge: And for that purpoſe make uſe of the <hi>Pulvis ſolutivus de tribus,</hi> recommended above, taking the weight of a Ducat, or a Ducat and an half, in warm
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52336:264"/>
Broath, and faſting two or three hours after it. Or fetch from the Apothecary of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatum Diaturbith cum Rhubarbaro,</hi> or the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoenicon in tabulis,</hi> taking half an ounce at a time, and keeping thy Chamber. Or, infuſe Sena-leaves in Wormwood-wine, and drink a ſmall glaſs-ful of it an hour before thy break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt: This will alſo ſerve very well, eſpecially if ſome <hi>Carduus benedictus</hi> have alſo been fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the Wormwood-wine.</p>
                     <p>If thou art troubled with Gripings or Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Belly, take of Zedoar, or Angelica-roots, or Orange-peels, cut them ſmall, and take at a time the weight of a Ducat in hot Broath. If the Inflation be much, take in the morning the quantity of a Haſel-nut of Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, faſting an hour after it; and if the pains of thy Belly prevail, make a Decoction of Wormwood in Wine, and drink of it as hot as thou canſt; this will allay the pains, and give thee ſome ſtools. Mean time abſtain from raw Fruit, and Beer, Milk, Herbs, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>If thou art ſwollen, take half a drachm of Rubarb, and about the ſame quantity or a little leſs of Mechocan; reduce it to powder, and take it in Wormwood-wine, or warm Broath, in the morning faſting, and eat nothing within an hour or two after. Be careful to take down ſome Treacle in the morning faſting; but you are firſt to be purged. Otherwiſe make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Roots of Elecampane and Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernel, or Swallow-wort, in Wine, and drink a warm draught of it mornings; it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine. If thou canſt bear amongſt it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52336:265"/>
Wormwood, <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> or Centory, add them in the Decoction, and it is a good potion for the Liver.</p>
                     <p>An Herb, call'd by the <hi>Latins Euphatorium Avicennae,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> (I think) <hi>Common Hemp-Agrimony,</hi> hath a great operation in ſwelled People, drinking of the Decoction thereof, made in Wine. Beſides, uſe in this caſe Parſley and Smallage-roots in thy meat. Boil Horſe-radiſh, and drink of the Decoction warm in the morning. Thy ordinary drink is to be a water, in which hath been boiled a good quantity of Cummin, Annis or Fennel. You may alſo now and then drink a little Wine, ſwelled people having no great heat in them.</p>
                     <p>From theſe obſtructions of the Liver and Meſaraic Veins comes difficulty of Breathing and a dry Cough, which occaſions the Inflation of the Belly, and helps to entertain the crudities and indigeſtions: Mean time there uſeth to follow upon this the Yellow Jaundiſe. For this, take the Roots of <hi>Cyclamen</hi> or Sow-bread, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to powder, and take the weight of half a ducat in Meath, or Wine mixt with a little Honey, ſweating upon it; and you ſhall find your ſheets diſcoloured of a yellowiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. In the ſame manner make uſe of the ſeed of <hi>Aquileja,</hi> or <hi>Columbine.</hi> I have reduced theſe three to powder, and mixt them together, and given of it the weight of a ducat to ſweat; which hath proved very ſucceſsful. Orange-peels uſed in like manner, do alſo much good in this caſe. The bitter Centory boiled in Meath, and a good draught drank of it warm in the morning, is alſo very good. Likewiſe a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52336:265"/>
of the white Hore-hound and Chicory-roots is alſo uſed to good purpoſe in this caſe. Theſe things expel alſo Worms, if any do lodge within thee; for which may alſo be uſed the Souldiers Pills of <hi>Aloe,</hi> called <hi>Marocoſtinae.</hi> In this caſe Vinegar of Squills is alſo an excellent remedy, taking of it in the morning early a ſpoonful, two or three, and exerciſing after it. It will open the Breaſt, and make you expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate phlegm and ſlime in abundance.</p>
                     <p>If you be troubled with Wind and Gripings of the Guts, be careful to have your Body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble. Boil <hi>Calamus,</hi> cut ſmall, in Broath, drink of it hot, putting a little <hi>Angelica,</hi> or <hi>Maſterwort.</hi> Do this mornings and evenings, and beware of drinking cold, and abſtain from all Milk, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf very warm, eſpecially about the Feet, which you will do well to bathe with a Decoction made of Aſarabacca, Camomile, wild Trefoil, wild Marjerom, wild Thyme, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little Salt into it. For your drink, boil Cummin, Annis or Fennel in Water, and now and then a glaſs of Wine may do well.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Gripings may alſo be cured with drinking very bitter Wormwood-wine, as hot as you can endure it. This is alſo opening. If you boil Elecampane and Orange-peels with the Wormwood, it will have the greater effect. And if you add to it <hi>Allium Sylveſtre</hi> (Crow-Garlick) you have an excellent Medicine for this purpoſe. This I have uſed my ſelf, and found preſent relief from it, when in a very hard Winter upon a Journey I was taken with theſe Gripings. 'Tis indeed a very unpleaſant potion, exceeding bitter, eſpecially being to be drunk
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52336:266"/>
hot; but the good effects will make amends for that. If the pains ſhould not ceaſe after all this, mix with it the quantity of a Haſel-nut of Treacle or Mithridate, and ſo drink it off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>If you can get Malvaſy, mix a little Oyl of Olives with it, and drink of it warm. Oyl of ſweet Almonds would be better, one half of that and the other of Malvaſy; though theſe things perhaps will not ſo eaſily be had in a Camp. Freſh Butter may ſerve inſtead of Oyl.</p>
                     <p>Elſe make a Decoction of Juniper-berries, or Laurel-berries, and Elecampane in ſtrong Wine, and drink a good draught of it morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and evenings. Or reduce the Herb <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus benedictus</hi> to powder, and drink its weight of a ducat in warm Malvaſy or other ſtrong Wine; it will remove the Gripings, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if you mix with it a little Zedoary pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed.</p>

                     <p>For an outward Application, take the Oyl of Rue and Wormwood, dip Cotton into it, and put it warm to thy Navil.

                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52336:266"/>The Oyl of Laurel-berries, mixing a little Juniper-berry-oyl or Nutmeg-oyl with it, may be uſed with great benefit, anointing the Navil therewith, and afterwards put to the Navil a warm dry bag filled with Bran and Camomile-bloſſoms. Or fry Cow-dung in the Oyl of Dill, or of Camomile, or of white Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and apply it thus to thy Navil, keeping thy ſelf, and eſpecially thy Leggs, very warm.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive any Hydropical Diſtemper in you, make a Decoction of Wormwood and Juniper-berries in Wine, drink every morning a warm draught of it faſting. You may alſo to very good purpoſe boil with it Swallow-wort, Burnet, or Succory-roots, adding alſo to it ſome Annis or Fennelſeed. But it will be requiſite firſt of all to purge with Mechoacan and Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb; and now and then to repeat this purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Abſtain from Milk, Beer, Fruit, and all raw and obſtructing food. If you knew how to uſe Elder, you would have an excellent Purge to free your Body from the Hydropical water, becauſe the Juyce of the Roots of Elder pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Hydropical Perſons exceedingly: But 'tis not ſo ſafe to uſe it, unleſs you do it with great caution, becauſe a very little of it taken inwardly purgeth both by ſtool and vomit, like Antimony. Half a nutſhel full may ſuffice. The like effect you'l find in Elder-buds boiled, and then dreſſed with Oyl and Vinegar like a Salad, eating a very little of it. But I adviſe you not to uſe too much of it; elſe it will caſt you into great faintneſs. The juyce of the Roots of blew Lillies hath the like vertue, but is likewiſe to be uſed with great diſcretion.</p>

                     <p>The Swelling of your Leggs may be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by heating ſome Tiles and ſprinkling them with Wine, and clapping them about your Leggs to make them ſweat.

                     <p>IN Wars and Camps, Bloody and other Fluxes are very frequent, cauſed by an irregular and ill dyet; and theſe Diſtempers, eſpecially the Bloody Flux, carry away abundance of Men. Where it is to be noted, that the Bloody Flux is infectious, and very catching.</p>
                     <p>Commmon Fluxes and Looſeneſſes may eaſily be cured. Amongſt other Remedies, take burnt Harts-horn, and take it often in Broath; or pulveriſe Medlar-kernels, and take of the powder in Broath likewiſe. Alſo an Electuary made of Quinces and Sloes will cure them. The ſame does Nutmeg, and the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52336:267"/>
Roots of Tormentil, Snakeweed, or the Roots of Cinquefoil, baked in Eggs, and eaten. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Seed of Dock, broad Plantain; item <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> or <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> and Whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-bread coming hot out of the oven, and dipt in red Wine, and eaten. Again, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick pulveriſed, and put into Almon-milk, red Wine, or Broath, the weight of a drachm, is good for ſuch a Looſeneſs eſpecially as comes from indigeſtion; adding a little Nutmeg or Galingal to it. Oaken-leaves alſo, or the Rinds of Pear-trees, with a little Mace boiled in Wine, and drunk, cureth common Fluxes. Again, <hi>Burſa Paſtoris</hi> (Shepherds-Purſe) boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Steel-water with a little Coriander, and drunk, is alſo very good; and ſo are Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes boiled in Vinegar, and the ſcales beaten to powder, taking a drachm of it mornings and evenings, either in red Wine or in Broath wherein in red-hot Steel hath been ſeveral times quenched. <hi>Hawes</hi> alſo boiled, and made into a thick Electuary, and ſtrained, is beneficial, if taken in the morning faſting, and an hour or ſo before ſupper, the quantity of a Walnut.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, take new Milk with its Cream on it, quench therein divers times red-hot Peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-ſtones, ſo that the Milk may grow hot of it; then mix with it two or three well-beaten Yolks of Eggs, two ounces of Sugar, melting in it an ounce and an half of the Suet of a Deer or Stagg, and about half an ounce of <hi>Album<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graecum,</hi> uſing it for a Clyſter, which clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and healeth the Guts, and allays the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Blood and other corroſive humors, that annoy the Bowels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:52336:268"/>But take heed of not ſtopping too ſuddenly the Bloody Flux, or any other Laske; for if you do, the annoyance will remain in the Body, and cauſe Impoſtumes, Difficulty of breathing, and other dangerous Diſtempers. Wherefore conſult with thy ſtrength, and if that be conſiderable, make not too much haſt; yet keep a bridle upon it, ſo as to be able to ſtop it when there is need. Mean time, if it be without a Fever or heat, you may do much with new Milk, drinking it alſo morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and evenings warm, ſome red-hot Stones having been quenched therein, and ſome Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar mixed with it, to prevent curdling in your Stomach. This Medicine was known to the famous <hi>Grecian</hi> Phyſicians, <hi>Aetius, Alexander Trallianus,</hi> and <hi>Galenus</hi> himſelf, <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>de Simpl. Med. facult.</hi> If you add a little <hi>Album<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graecum</hi> to it, 'twill be the better. I have my ſelf done much good with thus prepared Milk, but then there muſt be no Fever; which if there be, you'l eaſily perceive it by a great thirſt, quick pulſe, hot hands, and little ſleep <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For bloody Fluxes are not wont to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſhaking Fevers, but only with hot fits, which ſpend more of the Patients ſtrength in an hour, than ſhaking Agues in ſeveral days; which is to be well heeded.</p>
                     <p>Eggs boiled hard in Vinegar, and given to the Patient, that is troubled either with the Bloody or any other Flux, it will be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
                     <p>The Roots of Tormentil, or of Snake-weed pulveriſed, and this powder drunk in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient vehicle, the weight of a drachm, is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52336:268"/>
one of the moſt approved remedies againſt theſe Fluxes; Tormentil-roots being very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful not only to ſtop them, but alſo to take away their catching malignity.</p>
                     <p>The Moſs that grows on wild Roſe-ſhrubs, reduced to powder, and taken in Wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have been boiled the husks of Acrons, is an approved remedy in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>Scrape red Lead or Rudle, ſuch as Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters mark their lines with, put it into Wine or Broath, wherein hath been boil'd the broader kind of Plantain and Tormentil-roots; or take it in an Egg.</p>
                     <p>Hares-blood dried, and taken inwardly, is alſo a tried Medicine in this Diſtemper. <hi>Item,</hi> open a new-laid Egg, take out the white, and fill it up with Nutmeg, or the pulveriſed root of Tormentil, or of Snake-weed, and give it the Patient to eat; or put into it ſome pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed Blood-ſtone, and it will do good.</p>
                     <p>I have uſed with good ſucceſs the Seed of the broader Plantain, groſly beaten, and roſted in an Egg, againſt the Flux; and I know it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to have been beneficially uſed againſt the Bloody Flux.</p>
                     <p>Take of Mummy, a little Maſtick, Bol-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meniack, <hi>Sanguis Dracon<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Take Rye-biſcuit, and boil it in Water with Coriander, and the roots of Tormentil or of Cranes-bill; quench ſome Steel in it once or twice, and give of it to the Patient to drink.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:52336:269"/>Make a Decoction of Shepherds-purſe and Meadow-ſweet, in Water and Wine, and now and then drink of it.</p>
                     <p>Burn live Crafiſhes in an earthen Pipkin well-cloſed, until they be ſo burnt as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to powder; of which give to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient mornings and evenings a Thimble-full or two in a convenient Liquor.</p>
                     <p>A dried Liver of a ſucking Lamb, or of any other ſuch Animal, is very good in this caſe, provided ſuch a Liver, before 'tis dried, be boiled in Vinegar. Let the Patient take a drachm of it twice a day. Alſo the Blood of a Lamb, or of a Hind, both dried, will have here a good effect.</p>
                     <p>Take a Pigeon, Wood-cock, or Patridge, and having drawn any of them, fill them with Maſtick and a little Nutmeg, and ſo roſt them on a Spit, and whilſt they are roſting, baſte them with red Wine, and ſo let them roſt till they grow ſo hard as will make them pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable; then reduce them or any of them to powder, and take a ſpoonful of it at a time in warm Broath.</p>
                     <p>The higheſt Experiment in this caſe is <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Martis,</hi> taken in the Juyce of the broader kind of Plantain, or in a Pulſe of red Beans, or Rice-broath; the doſe is half a dram. But when the pain is very great, you may then add to it ſome opiat Medicine, as of the <hi>Trochiſques de Garabe,</hi> or one only grain of <hi>Laudanum Opiatum.</hi> And give the Patient now and then a little new-made Treacle, or mix with it a few grains of the <hi>Confection</hi> of <hi>Archigenes</hi>; for of ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments a Field-Apotheque is not wont to be deſtitute.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:52336:269"/>For the Patients ordinary drink, boil water, and in it Coriander, dried Sloes, dried ſlices of Quinces, burnt Harts-horn, Maſtick, Nutmeg, or any one of theſe; putting to it ſome of the roots of Snake-weed, Tormentil, or ſuch like adſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent roots. Of this water the Patient may drink according as his neceſſity ſhall require.</p>
                     <p>The red Juyce of Quinces, boiled up without Sugar, is alſo much to be commended in this caſe, for ſtrengthening the bowels, two or three ſpoonfuls of it being taken at a time, and that twice a day.</p>
                     <p>In many places a drink is made of Sloes, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſella</hi> or Mouſe-ear, and Juniper-berries, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them all in common water, and letting them ferment together. This yields a pleaſant acid drink, allaying the violence of the Flux, and quenching thirſt withal.</p>
                     <p>The Rich may make Granat or Quince-wine. But I have here undertaken to deliver ſuch things, as are parable and cheap for the poor common Souldier.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry, that in the Field there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of adminiſtring Clyſters: For, though I preſcribe none without great neceſſity; yet Clyſters being of great benefit in Diſeaſes of the bowels; they being to them like Plaiſters, I cannot but recommend in this Diſtemper Clyſters of Milk, wherein Pebble-ſtones have been ſeveral times quenched, mixing a little of the melted Suet of a Stag or Hind, without any Oyl or other fat. I remember, I had once a Patient of quality, that had about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtools within twenty four hours, who by the uſe of ſuch Clyſters, once or twice applied,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52336:270"/>
was fully reſtored. The cauſe whereof is, that the Milk waſhes the bowels, and clears them of the ſharp humors that annoy them; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is healing and repairing, by reaſon of the Pebbles quenched therein. The Sugar is abſterſive, and helps to clean the injured pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Fat ſticks to the parts annoyed, to defend them from being further hurt by the ſubſequent humors, which running down over it, can find no ſtay there, and conſequently cauſe no more hurt to thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>Yet muſt you not put in any greaſie Fat, or any Oyl of Olives, becauſe they hinder heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all Oyl, except that of Linſeed, Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, Hemp and Almonds, is very ſharp; and you will find, that if any drop of Oyl of Olives ſhould chance to fall into your Eye, no Juyce of Oranges or Limons is ſo ſtrong as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the acrimony of that Oyl. But of this Oyl more will be ſaid in the next Chapter, to which I therefore refer you. If you would have your Clyſter yet milder and more ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, you may beat a yolk or two of new-laid Eggs, and mix them with it; though I have contented my ſelf with the Ingredients before mention'd, and found great benefit thereby. Elſe you may in this caſe uſe for a Clyſter the <hi>Cremor hordei,</hi> mixt with yolks of Eggs bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it; which is alſo very good to waſh out the bowels.</p>
                     <p>Here is no conveniency of making much uſe of Apothecary-ſhops; elſe many things might be preſcribed to lay upon the belly and the navil, as alſo divers fermentations, and ſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Unguents. You may therefore content
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52336:270"/>
your ſelf with thoſe plain and eaſily parable means, already deliver'd, and be thankful to God for them.</p>
                     <p>But then you are alſo to think upon means to obviate Symptoms of this Diſtemper, and particularly <hi>Drought,</hi> which is wont very much to torment people in this Diſeaſe. 'Tis true, Acid things do quench thirſt, but they cannot be uſed boldly, and therefore you muſt uſe them with great diſcretion and warineſs. And as for ſweet things, they uſually increaſe thirſt, and do eaſily corrupt, and turn into gall. Wherefore give to the Patient preſerved Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; or if freſh ones be in ſeaſon, mix a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them with Honey or Sugar, and give him of it to eat upon white-Bread and Butter. Or plump dried Black-cherries, or dried Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcene-prunes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in half Wine and half Water, and let him hold &amp; ſqueeze them in his mouth. Or, if you can, mingle ſome Almond-milk with Chalybeat-water, and let him drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and this is both meat and drink. Or let him drink water, wherein Coriander and roots of Tormentil have been boiled. Or boil in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dried ſlices of Quinces, roots of <hi>Biſtorta</hi> or Snake-weed, and burnt Harts-horn, put into it a toſted cruſt of Rye-bread rubb'd with Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg, but let it not lye in it above a quarter of an hour, leſt the water ſhould thicken and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſcous. Marmelat alſo of Quinces, Black-cherries, and Sloes is proper in this caſe, giving the Patient a ſlice of it to hold upon his tongue, and ſo to ſwallow it down.</p>
                     <p>Further, you muſt learn how to remedy a <hi>Tenaſmus,</hi> which is more irkſome to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52336:271"/>
and, occaſions more trouble to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, than the Bloody-flux it ſelf, ſince it night and day painfully provokes the poor Patient to go to ſtool, and yet to no purpoſe. For this I have uſed many remedies, but found almoſt nothing more beneficial, than Fomentations of this nature following: Take <hi>Potentilla</hi> (wild Tanſie Silver-weed) Knot-graſs, Mullein, and Oak-leaves, of each as much as you pleaſe, put them into two linnen bags, and let them boil in Smiths-water, wherein much Iron hath been quenched: Squeeze out theſe bags be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two boards, and let them be held alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to the <hi>anus,</hi> as hot as can be endured. Black Pitch, ſuch as is found on Larch and Fir-trees, put upon a heated fire-ſhovel, and the fundament held over it, is alſo a good remedy; &amp; ſo is Turpentine, uſed after the ſame manner.</p>
                     <p>Again, take a black well-burnt Brick out of the hearth, heat it thoroughly, and wet it with ſharp Vinegar, and wrap it about with a linnen cloth, and let the Patient ſit on it as hot as he can endure it. This was the Experiment and Remedy of old <hi>Aetius</hi>; but he reduced the Brick to powder, and by boiling it in Vinegar, reduced it to a pulſe, and ſo put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a linnen rag, and applied it to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You may chuſe which you pleaſe of the two.</p>
                     <p>Milk-Clyſters, ſuch as above preſcribed, would alſo be good, but that 'tis not ſafe with Clyſter-pipes to vex the <hi>anus,</hi> which is already ſore enough. Yet you may give a Suppoſitory of Deers-ſuet mixt with ſome Oyl of Mullein. And the grey <hi>Diapompholox,</hi> or the white Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire-unguent,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52336:271"/>
or the like, mixt with it, would not be improper in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>If there be a Falling down of the fundament, then let it often take in the fumes of the above-mention'd Herbs, adding to them the beaten ſtalks of Sloe-ſhrubs, and thoſe of red Roſes, as alſo Mouſe-ear, and Mug-wort. The outer bark of Elder, and of Shepherds-purſe, doth alſo well with it. But above all things keep the Patient warm, and let by no means any of the aboveſaid ſteams grow cold on the ſore part.</p>
                     <p>Make alſo a Decoction of Garlick, and pour it hot into your cloſe-ſtool, let the Patient ſit upon it, to receive the hot ſteams. Beſides, put ſome burnt Harts-horn in a linnen cloth, and ſo ſtrew it upon the fundament, by little and little to drew it up. Or heat an Oaken-board very well, and cover it over with Stags-ſuet, and let the Patient ſit upon it whilſt 'tis hot. Put <hi>Colophonium</hi> or the Roſin of Pinetree upon a heated Iron, and let the Patient by holding his fundament over it take in the ſteams thereof, Anoint alſo the part with Butter, in which Onions have been boiled; and ſtrew upon it <hi>Album-graecum</hi> very finely pulveriſed. You may alſo make a Salve of Ceruſe, Bol-Armeniack, Dragons-blood, Stags-ſuet, Blood-ſtone, Oyl of Myrrh, or Butter in which firſt hath been boiled broad Plantain, Mullein, or wild Tanſie Silver-weed; and with this anoint the fundament.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Mariſca's,</hi> which do torment Men eſpecially, they may be cured with Oyl of Eggs, Salve of red Hounds-tongue, as alſo with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52336:272"/>
the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Populeum,</hi> or with Butter ſtirr'd up and down in a Leaden Mortar, till it turn grey or blackiſh, Let the Patient drink alſo of <hi>Scrophularia</hi> or Fig-wort, infuſed in his drink, this being a ſpecifick for that evil. Alſo the Oyl of Mullein, Elder-bloſſoms, Water-lilly, and White-lillies, is an excellent remedy for it, a rag dipped therein being laid upon the part affected. To uſe ſcarifying on the lower part of the back-bone, is alſo very good, though it be very painful.</p>
                     <p>If the Hoemorrhoid-vein bleed in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, and do not overbleed, it is an exceeding good thing, and preſerves from many Diſeaſes, as the Inflammation of the Lungs, Stitches of the ſides, the Leproſie, Melancholly, Quartans, and the like. If the ſame vein ſhould bleed in one that is mad, or diſturbed in his mind, or in one that is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Inflammation of the Kindneys, theſe Diſtempers would thereby be allayed. But if it ſhould bleed too often &amp; too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it weakens much, cauſeth a pale colour and the Dropſie. My Collegues and I have often open'd it by Leeches, and thereby found great benefit. But in caſe it ſhould exceed in bleeding, you muſt deal with it as you do with the Bloody Flux, and give to the Patient <hi>Terra Sigillata, Bol-Armeniack,</hi> burnt Harts-horn, and the like adſtringent things. If you can get ſome teeth of the <hi>Hippo-potamus,</hi> raſp it into powder, and drink ſome of it in red or white wine; it ſtops all bleeding, of the noſe, mouth, guts, fundament, hoemorrhoids, the matrix, eſpecially the bleeding of Women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delivery.</p>

                     <p>Concerning then the Peſtilential Bubo's and Sores, that riſe behind the Ears, under the Arms, and about the Groin, the Cure of them conſiſts chiefly in this, that they be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd with ſpeed; for which end are to be employed meer emollient and ſuppurating things. Yet are you to know to diſtinguiſh between Boyls, there being ſome of them that are not venomous, eſpecially in young people; and they may be hereby diſcerned, that at the touch they cauſe no pain, whereas the Peſtilential ones are very painful; which are alſo diſcover'd by the accompanying veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fever, and other pernicious Symptoms.

                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52336:273"/>Some there have been, that have uſed Scari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and even Veſicatories, thereby think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fetch out the venom. Others have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Sores through, about a hands breadth beneath the Sores, putting the root of black Helebore into them, thereby to draw out the venomous matter. But ſuch means have rather irritated the evil, cauſed great pains, and put the Patient to greater danger.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I judge nothing ſafer and better, than, as I was intimating, to uſe <hi>Emollients.</hi> Take then of the common Diachylon, and lay it upon the invenom'd Boyls; and beſides make a pulſe of theſe herbs, <hi>viz.</hi> of Camomile, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Melilot, Dill, Line-ſeed, Fenu-greek, Althaea, the roots of White Lillies, as alſo ſalve of Althaea, Oyl of Camomile and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, mixing a little Saffron with it, and ſome Oyl of Scorpions. Of this pulſe make ſome warm and lay it over the Diachylon upon the Sore.</p>
                     <p>Or, boil Wheaten-bread in the broath of Mallows and Camomile, till it grow ſoft, then ſaffron it over, and mix March-mallows-ſalve with it, and lay it on. Or make a Plaiſter of Figgs and roſted Onions; or, make a pulſe of Bread-leaven, Honey, yolks of Eggs, and the juyce of Onions, adding a little Turpentine to it, and ſo lay it on.</p>
                     <p>If the meer common <hi>Diachylon</hi> be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, uſe the Plaiſter <hi>Diachylon cum gummis</hi> or <hi>de Mucilaginibus,</hi> or mix a Melilot-plaiſter with the common Diachylon, make a pulſe of it with Oyl of Lillies, mixing a little Oyl of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions with it, and ſo lay it on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:52336:273"/>In laying on of Treacle, I have this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that Treacle, hinders putrefaction, which is the thing here moſt of all deſired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all maturation, which here is a reducing the Sore to ſuppuration, is a kind of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Here alſo the Plaiſter call'd <hi>Baſilicon</hi> is of good uſe; likewiſe the <hi>Ceratum Oeſipum Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grii</hi> and <hi>Meſuae,</hi> which <hi>Cerata</hi> are made of <hi>Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi Ammoniac, Bdellium, Turpentine,</hi> liquid <hi>Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, Gooſe-greaſe, Marrow of Cows-bones</hi> and <hi>Oeſipum,</hi> and a little Saffron. Some take a dried Toad, and lay it upon the boyl, to draw out the venom.</p>
                     <p>Now when the Sores are ſoftned and ripe, and yet break not of themſelves, they are to be opened with a lancet; and if you have to do with Perſons ſo delicate that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a lancet, you may make uſe of the <hi>Lapis Septicus</hi> or Corroſive-ſtone, which opens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, but is more ſlow. Mean time beware of opening the Sores too ſoon; for then they will turn to a hard ſwelling, which the Patient will not wear off whilſt he liveth.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome Plague-ſores that never break, but wear away by ſweat. Yet if they ſhould leave behind ſome hardneſs, you may, when the danger is paſt and the ſickneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, make uſe of ſome fomentations of Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, Camomile, March-mallows, Mullein and ſuch like: You may alſo take of the Gum, call'd <hi>Tacamahaca,</hi> and mix with it a Plaiſter of Melilot or Diachylon, and lay it on.</p>
                     <p>The Sores being open'd; they muſt be kept open with ſmall pellets, (called by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52336:274"/>
Quellmaiſſeln,</hi>) dipt in a Salve made for this purpoſe out of freſh Butter, Yolks of Eggs, and Turpentine, well mixt together cold.</p>
                     <p>But it happens ſometimes, that ſuch <hi>Bubo's,</hi> by reaſon of the venomous matter, do eat in, or grow fiſtulous, or make matter-baggs, in which the matter ſettles. In this caſe you muſt uſe the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum fuſcum, Apoſtolicum,</hi> or the <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi>: Or make the following water, to be ſquirted into ſuch Sores; namely of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>londine, <hi>Scordium</hi> or Water-germander, <hi>Cardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us-benedictus,</hi> Centory, or the like Herbs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Tormentil and Whitlow-graſs; all boiled in wine. If the Sores be very ill, you may boil with it ſome quick Brimſtone, and Myrrh, and if need be, mix with it a little fine Verdigreaſe. Or, take Honey four ounces and an half, a quarter of an ounce of <hi>Aloes Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi> a dram of Salt, an ounce and a half of Scordium, mix all well together, and keep it for uſe; and when you have occaſion for any of it, then diſſolve it in wine, and fpirt it in. Mean time, enlarge the opening of the Boyls with the aforeſaid Pellets, that ſo the matter may have vent enough, and come away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impediment.</p>
                     <p>The Unguent of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes Aldrovandus</hi> is alſo very good, for the clearing of ſuch Sores; and 'tis made of Oyl of Roſes, the Juyce of broad Plantain, ſharp-pointed Dock, Centory, and Night-ſhade, with a little Litharge, burnt Lead, and prepared Camphir. Inſtead of the Juyce of Night-ſhade, you may take that of Cumfry.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52336:274"/>As for the Sores call'd <hi>Anthraces,</hi> and thoſe they call Carbuncles, great care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to break them ſoon, and to heal them ſlowly, that ſo the poyſonous matter may all come away. They ripen and break ſooneſt by fatty (but not hot) Plaiſters and Unguents; eſpecially ſuch as are made of Butter, Leaven, Yolks of Eggs, and Honey; or if you mix to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Turpentine, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Populeum,</hi> or Roſe-ſalve mixt with Yolks of Eggs, or the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Anodynum</hi> mixt with the Ointment of Hounds-tongue, and laid on it. It muſt be often refreſhed, becauſe ſuch hot Sores and Ulcers, before they break, do ſo draw, waſte, and, as 'twere, lick up thoſe fatneſſes, that ſometimes of the Plaiſters, that have lain on them, there remains nothing but the bare ragg. The <hi>Emplaſtrum Baſilicon,</hi> or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon yellow drawing Plaiſter, is here the moſt uſeful.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo ſurround the <hi>Anthrax</hi> with good defenſives; for if it invade the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring part never ſo little, it will ſoon make a large <hi>halo</hi> or circle, which will at length ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the ſound, and fall away like an <hi>Eſcarre.</hi> For ſuch defenſives make uſe of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Camphoratum,</hi> or the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Liquiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> known by our people under the name of Dr. <hi>Mindererus his Licoriſh ointment. Item</hi> the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Lithargyro</hi>; or the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Jovis,</hi> prepared of freſh Butter, with <hi>Thlaſpi minus,</hi> or Bowyers Muſtard, (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe narrow-leav'd wild Creſſes,) Cranes-bill, Elder, Poppy, Vervain, and ſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Licoriſh. Some take nothing but Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52336:275"/>
and the freſh leaves of Henbane, beaten together, and the Juyce ſtrained, and ſo uſed. Of this Ointment you may make much with confidence; for it will do you very good ſervice in Inflammations, eſpecially in the caſe of the ſwelling of the Groins.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the approved Medicines for this purpoſe, may deſervedly be reckoned the Plaiſter made of Soot; which is thus to be prepared: Take of the fineſt Chimney-ſoot one ounce and a quarter; of Leaven, Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and freſh Butter, <hi>ana</hi> one ounce; of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Soap an ounce and a half; two Yolks of Eggs; of Treacle and Mithridate, <hi>ana</hi> a quarter of an ounce: Beat all theſe together in a Mortar, and ſo reduce it to a paſte, and then uſe it Plaiſter-wiſe.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Anthrax</hi> or the Carbuncle is broken, you muſt then handle it very gently and diſcreetly, uſing only the above-deſcribed Egg-ſalve, putting it into the opening, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Sore only with the common yellow drawing Plaiſter, or the Plaiſter prepared of Oyl, Wax and Roſin, or Turpentine. Let the matter work out well, and when you are ſure that 'tis very clean, and have a mind to conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate it, make only uſe of <hi>Triapharmacon,</hi> vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call'd the brown <hi>Diachylon</hi>; you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides put into it ſome of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and that of the <hi>Diapompholox,</hi> and one of the Plaiſters of them upon it. The <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lme</hi>-plaiſter alſo, made of Oyl and Ceruſe, heals alſo very well. But be very careful, leſt any of the matter remain lurking in the Ulcer. If here and there any ſhould be found yet remaining,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52336:275"/>
as often happens, then make uſe of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtrum Apoſtolorum.</hi> But if you can prepare the <hi>Diapalma,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Diacalcithros,</hi> make uſe of that. I am wont to call it the <hi>Fiſtula</hi>-plaiſter, becauſe it doth not eaſily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Fiſtula</hi>'s to ſtink, but keeps them clean and ſweet. Such a Plaiſter is alſo that, which is called <hi>Iſis,</hi> to be found in <hi>Galen,</hi> and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing. They are both to be found in the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> Diſpenſatory, together with the way of preparing them.</p>
                     <p>Now what concerns <hi>Old</hi> Sores, which many are troubled with, in their Leggs eſpecially, becauſe the humors of the body uſually ſettle there; you muſt above all things be careful to keep them clean, and to that end waſh them, at leaſt once a day, with your own Urine: Or boil <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> Egrimony, Plantain, and Roots of Tormentil, in half ſmall Meath and half Wine, and waſh the Ulcer with it, as often as you dreſs it. Among the common Plaiſters for ſuch evils is the brawn <hi>Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> one of the beſt. Elſe you may prepare this Ointment which follows: Take the middle rind of Elder, and St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort, boil them in Oyl, putting a little Wine to it, and ſo let it boil up till the Wine be boiled away; then take it off from the fire, and let it cool; this done, ſtir a little Turpentine amongſt it, and a Yolk or two of Eggs, according as you make a greater or leſſer quantity; mixing with it a little Allum and Vitriol, (the white is the beſt,) ſtir all well together, and apply it to the Ulcer, and make a bandage, and cover it as uſually. For a good Drawing-plaiſter,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52336:276"/>
take Roſin, Bees-wax and Oyl-Olive; the quantity of the Roſin muſt be but the half of the Wax: Let them melt together, and ſtir amongſt it ſome Tartar exquiſitely powder'd. Uſe not much of fatty things to ſuch Ulcers. I have had under my care ſuch Ulcers, that were to be healed with only dry things, as with ſtrewing in of <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and the red Earth of Vitriol, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon the antient Phyſicians and Chirurgeons invented a dry Stone, which they kept ſo ſecret, that they called it <hi>Lapis Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophorum</hi>; which is eaſily made, as followeth: Take Allum, Hungarian Vitriol, of each one pound, beat them to powder, and mix them well together; then put all into a glaſed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot, and pour upon it two quarts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, boil them together, and ſtir them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> taking off the ſcum: When 'tis boiled in, put to it an ounce of <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> an ounce and a half of Ceruſe, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ounce of Camphir, all finely powder'd, ſtirring it well about; laſtly, put it to a quart of ſharp Vinegar, and boil all together to a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſiſtence; which reduce to powder, and of it ſtrew a little into the Ulcer, or let ſome of it diſſolve in a convenient Liquor, and waſh the Ulcer therewith, or dip ſome Linnen raggs in it, and lay it over the place.</p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo prepared this way: Take green and white Vitriol, of each a drachm; of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> Ceruſe, Bol-Armeniack, of each two ounces and a half; of Sal-Armoniack an ounce. Beat them all to powder, put them in an earthen pot, mingle and ſtir them together
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52336:276"/>
in Vinegar, to be a thick pulſe; then put your pot upon a hot Charcoal-fire, to let it grow red hot, ſo as that the matter be reduced to a ſtony conſiſtence; of which diſſolve about half an ounce in half a pint of Water, dip Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen raggs into it, and put it twice a day upon the Ulcer. 'Tis alſo very good for purulent Breaſts.</p>
                     <p>I was ſpeaking above of <hi>Lavements</hi>: Theſe you may prepare of all ſorts of Wound-herbs, by boiling Conſound, Bugle; Fluellin, Ground-Ivy, Yarrow, Snake-weed, Avens, Arſmart; you may alſo, againſt putrefaction and the ſettling of purulent matter, mix ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little Myrrh, or <hi>Aloes Epatica,</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, Maſtick, quick Brimſtone, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, Niter, Allum, Vitriol, or the like. Nor is it needful to bind your ſelf to this or that preciſely, but you may take ſuch of them as you can get.</p>
                     <p>I have a peculiar Ulcer-ſalve, which I call <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Decameron,</hi> being made of ten ſorts of Juices. Of theſe the principal is the Juice of <hi>Perſicaria,</hi> (Arſmart;) to which are added the Juices of Groundſel, Tobacco, Yarrow, ſharp-pointed Dock, Cranes-bill, broad and pointed Plantain, Centory, St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort, and Celondine. Theſe Juices muſt be well ſtrained, and then kept for ſome days in glaſſes or gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Veſſels to ſettle, and then very gently pour off the clear from the ſediment. Which done, boil them with freſh Butter, and ſome good Licoriſh newly ſcraped, as alſo ſome Tormentil and Cumfrey, adding a little red Hounds-tongue Salve and Oyl of Myrrh, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52336:277"/>
Deer-ſuet: Let all be boiled together, till the cracking ceaſe, and the Juice be boiled in. Then ſtrain it through a Linnen Cloth; and add to it ſome Venice-Turpentine, Gum <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> and a little Bees-wax, both the latter melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each a part. Of the Wax there needs no more than to bring the Salve to a due conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Then is this Unguent prepared, to which may be added a little refined Verdigreaſe, which will make it perfect. It is of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in foul Wounds, for both cleanſing and healing; as experience will ſhew.</p>
                     <p>A Chirurgeon, in meeting with Ulcers, is to obſerve well the purulent matter that iſſues, ſince he may from thence learn the condition of the evil, whether it proceed from foul Blood, Gall, corrupt Phlegm, or Aduſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. If the evil grow worſe, and the Humors of the Body force their way copiouſly thorow, then beware, and withal exhort the Patient to purge, or to ſweat with taking ſome Saſſafraſs, or the like.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sanies</hi> or matter that is thick, white, and well digeſted, is the beſt; but when there runs but a ſharp water out of the Ulcer, this is not good, and is withal painful. Which to obviate, you muſt uſe Litharge, Ceruſe, and the like; putting alſo beaten Lead upon the place, and cleanſing the fiſtulat holes with Lead-oyl, qualifying its ſharpneſs with Oyl of Eggs. This Lead-oyl is made two ways, the the one out of Ceruſe, which is green; the other out of Litharge, which is yellow or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Both are prepared with Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Boil <hi>Celondine</hi> in wine, and with this wine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52336:277"/>
you may alſo cleanſe the Ulcer with good effect. Mix afterwards a drachm of Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe with about four ounces of the Juyce of Ground-Ivy; uſe it with wiecks or raggs dipt therein for the foul Ulcer-holes.</p>
                     <p>Burn Oyſter-ſhells to powder, and uſe it for old Ulcers that need cleanſing, which this powder will well perform by reaſon of the Salt that is in thoſe ſhells. You may ſometimes have occaſion alſo of the <hi>Mercurius praecipitatus,</hi> or the <hi>Mercurius dulcis Coſmeticus.</hi> If you can prepare this you have a good Remedy.</p>
                     <p>As for hard Knobs and Boyls, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly owing their riſe to the Venereal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe are not ſo proper for this place. However you may make a plaiſter againſt ſuch Knobs of the phlegm of Althaea or Marſh-mallows, Gummi Ammoniac, Galbanum, Turpentine, Myrrh, Miſſel-toe of the oak, mixing a little Bee-wax therewith and ſome Oyl of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms. If you will have it ſtronger, mix with it Gumm Elemi, Tacamahaca or Carana. But this can only be compaſſed by the rich men; the poor muſt be content with the Melilot-plaiſter, mixt with Saffron and the Oyl of Mullain or Dill. You may alſo prepare for ſuch Patients a Salve of Fox-oyl, Dill-oyl, Turpentine, Man-greaſe, and the like, mixing therewith ſome Oyl of Earth-worms and the Oyl of Mullain-flowers, Camomil and white Lillies.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Chirurgical means of ſtaunching blood, of Wound-balſoms and plaiſters, of Wound-drinks, and remedies for Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</head>
                     <p>THis is the moſt neceſſary <hi>Chapter</hi> of this whole Tract. For, although in every Camp, yea in every Regiment, and even in every Company there ought to be one or more Chirurgeons; yet becauſe in a battle, or the ſtorming of a ſtrong-hold, there may be wounded a very great number of men, who, by reaſon of the multitude, cannot all be dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Chirurgeons, every common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, that is ſound and unhurt, is obliged to aſſiſt his fellow, conſidering it may ſoon be his own caſe.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place then, refreſh thy fellow that is wounded, with wine, cold water, vinegar, or the like; then place him in a right poſture. For, if the wounds be in the head or about the breaſt, you ought to lay him high with his head and ſhoulders, that ſo the blood may ſink down from the places wounded. If his legg be hurt, put it ſo that it may not hang downwards, and thereby the afflux from the body be prevented, which otherwiſe might cauſe a tumour. If the wounds be in the middle of the body, then place him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52336:278"/>
ſo, that, if poſſible, he may lye ſomewhat hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with his back.</p>
                     <p>This done, waſh the wound very gently, (ſo as not to anger it,) with meer wine, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with pure common water, only with a very little ſalt caſt into it: or with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients own urine; and then dry it with lint of long-worn linnen, without much ſtirring in the wound, for fear of making the veins bleed again.</p>
                     <p>If any one do bleed ſo copiouſly, that it is not eaſily ſtopp'd, and the Patient is in danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then receive of his blood in an Iron pan, and letting it run about therein, hold it over the fire till it be dry and between your fingers fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to powder; of which ſtrew ſome into the bleeding wound, and it will ſtop it. But of this caſe more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The wound being cleanſed, and the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtayed, take fine linnen-raggs, burn them as you are wont to do for tinder, and quench it in Oyl of Olives; and put ſome of it into the wound, If you have no plaiſter at hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> take a ſlice of unſalted lard and lay it on. If that be alſo wanting, dip a pledget of linnen-raggs in warm wine, and being wrung out very dry, lay it upon the wound, and a dry bandage over it, that ſo the moiſt pledget may long keep warm. Though in ſuch wounds, as are apt to bleed much, warm bandages are often to be avoided, and ſometimes (but with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular care and diſcretion) cold bandages to be uſed, if the hurt be not in the brain, breaſt or bowels. Whence old <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath this Aphoriſm: <hi>Frigido verò in iis locis utendum, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52336:279"/>
ſanguis aut fluit aut fluxurus eſt.</hi> Yet this muſt be done with great caution, leſt in the place affected there ſhould follow a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</p>
                     <p>After this, take Oyl of Olives and Wine, beat them well together, and warm the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; dip it in Linnen pledgets, wring them dry, and lay them on warm with a dry ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage over it. This muſt de done once every hour, or every two hours, nor let this care and labour ſeem irkſom to you, for it will have a good effect.</p>
                     <p>This Dreſs is almoſt the only thing, which the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Maltha</hi> make uſe of at Sea to heal their wounds; for the Oyl allays the pain and the ſwelling, as the Wine cleanſeth, and theſe two together cauſe healing. Whence the <hi>Samaritan</hi> in the Goſpel is ſaid to have poured only Oyl and Wine into the wounds of him, that was fallen among Thieves. You may therefore make out of theſe two a Wound-ſalve that may be equivalent to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every common Wound-balſom, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take one part of Oyl-olive, and two parts of Wine, boil them together till the Wine be boiled in, and the Oyl, when any is thrown into the fire, cracks no more; and you have a Wound-oyl according to wiſh: Put of it with fine Linnen ſhavings into the wound, and it will, for a plain Remedy, do marvels.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo melt Lard unſalted, mix it with Honey and Rye-flower, and ſo make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Salve, which, though plain and ſimple, may when put upon the Wound, have as good an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52336:279"/>
effect, as many Plaiſters that are in great eſteem.</p>
                     <p>Otherwiſe, for a very good Wound-ſalve, take of the beſt <hi>Aloes</hi> cleanly pulveriſed the weight of a ducat, mingle and ſtir it with half an ounce of fine Honey; melt afterwards by it ſelf half an ounce of Deer-ſuet, and ſtir it among the other Ingredients: Thus you have a good Salve againſt the putrefaction of wounds, and for the aſſwaging of their pains, as alſo for healing them, if you duly apply it to the wound: If you'l add to it a little Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus-Turpentine with the Yolk of an Egg, you may.</p>
                     <p>The black Wheel-greaſe in a time of need is alſo a good Wound-ſalve, and is only deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed becauſe of its plainneſs. When you uſe it, lay only over it the leaves of Snake-weed, or of pointed Plantain.</p>
                     <p>But by all means keep the wound clean, and let not many look into it, for fear they ſhould by their breath annoy it; ſome being faſting, others having eaten one thing, others ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But eſpecially admit not many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when you open the wound for cleanſing and dreſſing it. But above all things take care to exclude the Air as much as is poſſible from the open'd wound, eſpecially if any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Nerve be hurt. Take notice, that Carpenters and Joyners, when they have hurt themſelves, do almoſt by this only means of well cloſing their wounds, and keeping out the Air, heal themſelves. They take a very thin chip, and lay upon it ſome of the Glue, wherewith they joyn together the Boards of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52336:280"/>
their work, and this they apply to the wound, firſt well cleanſed, and let it lye on, till it fall off of it ſelf, and the wound is healed. But this will not do in caſe any Bones be hurt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> take Honey and the Duſt-flower of the Mills, freſh Butter and Bol-armeniack, and knead it well together, without any fire, until it be as thick as a Plaiſter, and this laid on is very good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> take Cumphrey well cleanſed, cut it ſmall, add to it one or two of the Vulnerary Herbs, ſuch as you may meet with in the field, as <hi>Pyrola</hi> or Winter-green, Yarrow, Plantain, Fluellin, Orpin, Conſound, Sanicle, Bugle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Boil this in Linſeed-oyl and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wine, until the Wine is boiled away; and this being ſtrained, put to it ſome raw Honey and one or two well beaten yolks of Eggs, (according to the quantity you make) and a little Turpentine, and ſo thruſt it, with ſome Hemp or Flax dip in it, into the wound.</p>
                     <p>Lime-water is one of the ſimpleſt or plaineſt Remedies, but healeth admirably well. Take only ſome unſlaked Lime, pour on it clear Water, and let it ſtand upon it till the Lime be fallen to the bottom: Waſh the wound with it, eſpecially ſuch as are old running Sores, and you'l find a wonderful effect.</p>
                     <p>Theſe plain means may be uſed, in caſe you want a Chyrurgeon, taking the aſſiſtance of your Fellow-ſouldier in the application; though thoſe very Remedies may challenge a place among the moſt chargeable ones, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and applied by Maſters. And provided the Chyrurgeon do not under-value theſe my
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52336:280"/>
plain and cheap Remedies, but receive them thankfully, I am ready here to teach him ſome ways, hitherto concealed by me, which I ſcruple to keep any longer from publick knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Know then firſt, that to a Phyſician belongs alſo the knowledge of Chirurgery, as a third part of the Art of Medicine, the other two being the <hi>Pharmaceutica,</hi> preſcribing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for inward Diſeaſes, and the <hi>Diatetica,</hi> ordering the Patients Diet and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I have my ſelf, whilſt I practiſed Phyſick, dreſſed in Camps many wounds with my own hands and cured them, carrying always my Chirurgical <hi>apparatus</hi> about me, without any diſparagement to my Profeſſion; imitating herein the Examples above-alledged, of <hi>Podaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Machaon,</hi> two of the chief Phyſicians of the Antients in the Army before <hi>Troy,</hi> who were not at all aſhamed to practiſe Chirurgery, and to attend the cure of wounded Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Firſt of all then, conſider well, whether the wound be mortal or no. Next, what limb or part it is that hath received the wound: The wounds in the Head are commonly the moſt dangerous, by reaſon of the Symptoms inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them, as the Apoplexy, Falling-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or other Convulſions, the Palſey and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Limbs by reaſon of the hurt Nerves, as alſo Phrenſy, loſs of Hearing and Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are wont to be conſequent, according as the reſpective Nerves have been ſtruck or wounded. If the Breaſt be any where wounded, great care alſo is to be had, and the means muſt be directed to prevent purulency,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52336:281"/>
(which that place, by reaſon of the heat there, is ſubject to,) and to heal the <hi>Pleura</hi> or the inner Membrane of the Ribbs; the like is to be done concerning the Diaphragme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ought alſo to obſerve, what kind of wound it is you have to do with, whether any Bone, any Nerve or Artery be hurt; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a meer fleſh-wound, and the like. If it be a gaping wound, you muſt, if it hath taken cold from the Air, bathe it with warm Wine, and keep it very cloſe; and make uſe of the ſtrong aſtringent Plaiſter, prepared of Roſin, Gumm Elemi, Turpentine, Pitch, with ſome Maſtick, Frankincenſe, <hi>Sarcocolla,</hi> as alſo ſome Blood-ſtone, Mummy, and <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Martis</hi> mixt therewith, and keep all on carefully with a good bandage, which is a great matter in all wounds. For, ſome months ſince, I had a Patient under my cure, whoſe Skull in the place of one of its futures was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, ſo as that I found a conſiderable ſpace between the two parts ſeparated. I order'd a Chirurgeon of my particular acquaintance to draw thoſe parts forcibly together with good bandages; which being well done, I cauſed his Hair to be ſhorn away, and an aſtringent Plaiſter to be applied, which was almoſt like a Rupture-plaiſter: whereby in three or four weeks, to the admiration of many, my Patient was perfectly healed. This plaiſter was the <hi>Ceratum ex pelle arietina,</hi> mixt wit Gumm <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> and with a little <hi>Ceratum de Betonica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo be provided with good Blood-ſtaunching remedies. The common ones are, <hi>Bol-armeniac, Sheep-trickles, Blood-ſtone, Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52336:281"/>
Terra Sigillata, Mill-duſt, Hares-hair, Peacocks-dung, &amp;c.</hi> Avoid by all means Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, eſpecially Sublimat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arſenic, Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar; with which you anger a wound, and caſt the Patient into very dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms: For, though they may by their corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs at firſt aſtringe the wound, yet they do afterwards ſo fret and eat it, that you would think, hell-fire were in it. Beware alſo of a hot Iron, which many have a refuge to as to a Maſter-piece and the laſt remedy.</p>
                     <p>Among the chief Aſtringents, is <hi>Frog-ſpawn</hi>; which therefore you are, when 'tis in ſeaſon, to make good proviſion of, for the whole year. Take therefore in the Spring a lump of raggs, and dip it into Smiths-water, in which firſt ſome crude Allum hath been diſſolved. Let this lump be dried again, and then draw it thorough the Spawn of Frogs, ſo as that the Spawn may every where hang on it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to the Air to dry; and afterwards draw the ſame again thorough Frog-ſpawn: Which repeat as often as you can, during the ſeaſon of Frog-ſpawn; for the oftner you dip the raggs into it, the more vertue they will receive. This Spawn ſtauncheth bleeding, with a good bandage. I have often uſed with good ſucceſs the diſtilled water of Frog-ſpawn in the bleeding of the Noſe, firſt mixt with crude Allum, and then drawn up into the Noſtrils. Take a green Frog, burn him in a pipkin, not to aſhes, but ſo as to be reducible to powder: This powder put into a ſmall Taffaty-bagg, and hang it about the neck of a woman that floods exceſſively; and ſhe will find great help from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52336:282"/>Having often made mention of Allum, which is one of the chief remedies for ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of blood, I will make publick the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Allum,</hi> which I have hitherto kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Take then of the beſt and cleareſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum as much as you pleaſe; pulveriſe it, and put the powder into an Oxe-or Swines-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, tying it very cloſe; Then throw it into a kettle of hot water, and the Allum will be diſſolved; this Solution bring over the helm out of a low retort, until the Allum get a <hi>caput mortuum</hi>; then ceaſe to urge the fire any more, leſt you force corroſive ſpirits from it, which are noxious to our preſent purpoſe. This <hi>caput mortuum</hi> put again into a bladder, and diſſolve it as before; and do this ſo long, until the whole body of your Allum be brought over the helm. But you muſt filter the firſt ſolution for fear of any duſt or other heterogeneous matter mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>This is the Magiſtery of Allum, able to draw the veins together without corroſion. Apply this to wounds, or any other bleeding part. You may mix with it Tragacanth, Gummi Arabick, <hi>Sanguis Draconis,</hi> and well-beaten Whites of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Take good notice, whether the wounded Patient have heated himſelf in ſtorming a place, or by any other military execution, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be yet diſtemper'd by paſſion; for as long as this laſts, the blood is in a rage, and can hardly be ſtopped. In this caſe ſtop the wound with Peacocks dung; and take Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Whites of Eggs well beaten together, a little Allum, and refined Salt-peter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52336:282"/>
it as much Frog-ſpawn, Shepherds-purſe, broad Plantain, or other convenient water, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; ſo that there may be three parts of water and one part of vinegar; dip pledgets into it, and clap them cold to the wound, and the bleeding will ceaſe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> alſo is an excellent ſtauncher of blood, to be uſed both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. For inwardly it cureth the Bloody Flux and other Fluxes; and outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to wounds and ſtrewed into them, it cloſeth the veins. But it muſt not be prepared with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or diſtilled Vineger, or any corroſive thing, but only by the heat of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberating furnace; and afterwards diſtil often from it ſome proper water, as of <hi>Roſes, Speed-well, Self-heal</hi> or broad <hi>Plantain,</hi> after which preparation it is divers times to paſs again through a reverberating furnace, until it grow as light as a down-feather: And then 'tis fit for our purpoſe; for as long as it is ſtrong and heavy, the body of it is not throughly opened.</p>
                     <p>Among other things, you may make uſe of the Red earth of Vitriol; which is to be thus prepared: Take Vitriol, as much as you pleaſe, put it in a new unglaſed pipkin, into a Potters oven, to deprive it of its moiſture, and to reduce it to a <hi>Colcothar</hi>: Then pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſe this calcined Vitriol, and in a large glaſed earthen diſh pour hot water on it, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſtand ſo for four or five hours; then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant the water, and pour other hot water upon it, as before, repeating this three, four, or five times, until all the ſalt be got out of the ſaid <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar</hi>;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52336:283"/>
which whether it be done, may eaſily be found by the taſte. Then dry this red dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Earth, and it will prove a very good blood-ſtaunching medicine; which may alſo in other caſes be variouſly uſed; as you'l find it hereafter of great uſe in my plaiſter for wounds made by thruſting.</p>
                     <p>The water you had poured on this <hi>Colcothar,</hi> you ought not to throw away as uſeleſs, but to put it by; and, for other occaſions, you may boil it away, and it will leave a Salt behind, as white as ſnow, with which you may do wonders in foul Sores. I have uſed it with good ſucceſs in ſuch caſes; in which it clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and maketh a firm ground for new and good fleſh to grow upon. For, though there be many things, that cleanſe Sores, yet they leave the fleſh looſe and ſpungy; but this is both aſtringent, and withal maketh ſuch a ſound and firm bottom, that you may truſt to it: Whence alſo it is to be uſed in fiſtulous Sores.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the ſtopping of Blood; take the blood of a Lamb or Sheep, let it ſtand in a clean earthen veſſel, until the <hi>ſerum</hi> be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from it; pour this off, and dry the blood well in a new glaſed pipkin, upon hot embers: Then pulveriſe it, and mix with it a fourth part of clean pulveriſed <hi>Tragacanth,</hi> and ſtrew this into the wound. If the iſſue of the blood be ſo impetuous, that it waſhes away the firſt application, then wipe the wound again, and ſtrew into it of the ſame powder the ſecond time. Putting amongſt it Allum, <hi>Crocus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> or the red Earth of Vitriol, you will do
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52336:283"/>
well: Bind the wound with the <hi>Emplaſtrum Santalinum,</hi> (which is called <hi>Incognitum</hi> by our Chirurgeons,) or with the <hi>Ceratum ex pelle arietina,</hi> due to <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The blood being ſtopt, and the wound cleanſed, you muſt then apply good vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Oyls or Wound-balſoms. Oyls are all, as I mention'd above, fatty; whence it is, that they do not eaſily conſolidate wounds, unleſs you put to them ſome refined <hi>Maſtic, Sarco-colla, Sanguis Draconis, Sandarach,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>But to open unto you the good affection of my heart, I ſhall deſcribe here my Wound-balſom, wherewith I have, by Gods aſſiſtance, done much good, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take as much as you pleaſe of Turpentine of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which comes from <hi>Venice,</hi> and is taken inwardly; and the ſame quantity of the red Oyl of St. <hi>Johns-wort,</hi> diſſolve them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Then take Gumm Elemy, diſſolve it apart, and pour it among the other; and ſo let all cool, and when 'tis half cold, pour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt it a little Oyl of Bees-wax, and your Balſom is prepared. I cannot tell you the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe weight of each ingredient, becauſe as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I have prepared it, I have done it by the Eye, and as it ſeemed good unto me; only note, that there muſt be ſo much of the Gumm Elemy as to give it a due conſiſtence; which you may try, by caſting a drop or two of it into cold water; this Balſom being to be thinner than an Unguent, and yet thicker than Oyl.</p>
                     <p>This Balſom heals very ſpeedily, eſpecially
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52336:284"/>
when uſed in wounds freſhly inflicted, on fine pledgets, and only with a yellow Tractif bound over it.</p>
                     <p>Be alſo provided with good Plaiſter for wounds made by Thruſting, ſuch as are the <hi>Opodeldoch</hi> of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> or the good black Thruſt-plaiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus to be prepared: Take of Oyl of Roſes ſeven ounces; of <hi>Colophonium,</hi> black Pitch, white Wax, Roman Vitriol, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe, Frankincenſe, Myrrh, <hi>ana</hi> eight ounces; of Maſtic, one ounce of the Oyl of Eggs, two ounces; of Spike-oyl, one ounce; of the Oyl of Juniper-berries, three ounces; of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> two ounces; of white Vitriol and red Corals, <hi>ana</hi> two ounces; of <hi>Heron</hi>-ſuet, one ounce; of Magnet, two ounces; of well cleanſed Earth-worms pulveriſed and of Camphir, <hi>ana</hi> one ounce: Of all this make a powder <hi>ſecundum artem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My <hi>Opodeldoch,</hi> that I make uſe of, is almoſt like this, but that I mix with it the red Earth of the Oyl of Vitriol, above ſpoken of in the matter of Blood-ſtaunching; and add alſo to it Turpentine and Gumm <hi>Elemi,</hi> with ſome <hi>Tutia, Aloes epatica,</hi> well prepared <hi>Lapis Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris,</hi> and <hi>Crocus Martis</hi>: And thus the Plaiſter becomes red and hard, like <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sealing-wax. I take alſo <hi>Gummi Ammoniac, Galbanum</hi> and <hi>Opoponax,</hi> the Oyl of <hi>St. Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort</hi> and <hi>Myrrh.</hi> This Plaiſter draws from the bottom, and reaches deep. A Souldier, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this about him, and, upon occaſion, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it only to ſome flatneſs, there being no need of laying it on a cloth, may thus put it on the wound, taking it off mornings and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52336:284"/>
evenings to wipe it clean; and then working it through again, lay it on as before: And ſo he may heal himſelf; which when done, let him clean the Plaiſter, and role it up in a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for another occaſion.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen conſiderable opperations of Gumm Elemi uſed alone, laid on leather, and put upon the thruſt; but this wound is then to be kept from falling together.</p>
                     <p>To prevent incidental heat and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounds, make uſe of the Oyl of Roſes, Bol Armeniac, Whites of Eggs and Camphir. But to avoid trouble, you may find ready, in the Apothecary-ſhops, the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentum album, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Minlo, Camphora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum de Liguiritia, de Lithargyro, Santilinum,</hi> and the like; to be put about the wound when dreſſed.</p>
                     <p>You may with great benefit, and you ought alſo, eſpecially in the wounds of the Head, provided there be no danger of bleeding, lay over the bandage ſome fine raggs moiſten'd in wine, and well dried again. This allays the pain, and withall prevents ſwelling.</p>
                     <p>And in caſe the wound be ſwelled, you may alſo to good purpoſe make uſe of Fomentations made of the herb and flowers of <hi>Mullein, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Egrimony, Cowſlips, Camomil, Melilot, Ground-Ivy, red Roſes, Bugle,</hi> and the like: But beware of all hot things, whatever they be. Boil the aforeſaid herbs or the like in half wine and water; but if the wound be not inflamed, take two parts of wine and one of water. With ſuch fomentations I have done much good; among others upon a Fencing-Maſter
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52336:285"/>
of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> called <hi>Cameyſen,</hi> who in the publick Fencing-ſchool received thruſts in both his Eyes, inſomuch that by reaſon of the great ſwelling that enſued thereupon he loſt all his ſight; but by the uſe of ſuch fomentations, God bleſſing the means, I recover'd his ſight.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Bone</hi> being broken, ſet it carefully, and bind it up ſtrongly, having laid upon it <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> or <hi>Emplaſtrum de pelle Arietina.</hi> You may alſo comfort ſuch wounds with the like fomentations, as before deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>On the bank of the <hi>Rhine</hi> is found a Stone in the gravel, call'd <hi>Lapis ſabuloſus,</hi> which is eaſily reducible to powder: Of this, if you can get it, give to the Patient, whoſe bone is broken, a drachm to be taken in broath, mornings; of which he will find a very good effect.</p>
                     <p>In the caſe of a Limb wrenched, clap to it <hi>Bran</hi> boiled in wine, ſometimes, according to occaſion, mixing with it a little Salt, and <hi>Marſhmallows</hi> or red <hi>Hounds-tongue-ſalve.</hi> If it have happened long ago, then make a pulſe of Wheaten-flower, Milk, and the Oyl of <hi>Camomil</hi> or <hi>Mullein</hi>; mixing a little Saffron with it, and clap it on hot. If there be any collection or coagulation of blood, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent of Hounds-tongue will do well, together with a linnen compreſs moiſtened in warm wine.</p>
                     <p>You muſt alſo be provided with good Wound-drinks; but they muſt be prepared diverſly, according to the ſeveral places wounded. Thus in the wounds of the Head, <hi>Betony</hi> challenges the pre-eminence and the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52336:285"/>
greateſt quantity of all the Vulnerary Herbs; In the wounds of the Sides, <hi>Carduus Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> claims that right; in the wounds of the Breaſt, <hi>Veronica</hi> (or Speedwell) ought to have it; in thoſe about the Kidneys, the Herb Strawberry muſt be preferred; in thoſe near the Liver, Agrimony will have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, and ſo forth. Mean time, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Herbs to be uſed in ſuch occaſions, are theſe; <hi>Sanicle, Winter-green, Ladies-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Speedwell, Orpine, Mugwort, Ground-Ivy, Straw-berry-leaves, Agrimony, St. Johns-wort, Cinquefoil, Bugle, Tormentil, Snakeweed, Avens, Woodrooff,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>You may make an excellent Wound-drink of theſe four Ingredients, <hi>viz. Winter-green, Orpine, Mugwort</hi> and <hi>Snakeweed,</hi> boiled in half Wine and Water; but in caſe there be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Wine is to be forborn, or very little of it to be employed.</p>
                     <p>If any Bone be broken into ſplinters, do not pull them out with any violence, but looſen them with a good Ointment of Eggs, keeping the wound open the longer. Nature her ſelf will not ſuffer any ſplinter to remain behind.</p>
                     <p>Now you muſt be ready with ſome good thing for Blood coagulated, in caſe any perſon ſhould have been flung down, ſqueezed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or fallen from a high place. The right powder for this purpoſe is thus made: Take of <hi>Terra Sagillata,</hi> or <hi>Bol-Armeniack, Sanguis Draconis</hi> and <hi>Mumia, ana</hi> half an ounce, of <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> and <hi>Rhubarb ana</hi> half a drachm, reduce it to a powder; of which give the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

the weight of about a ducat in Wine, or Chervil-water. Or take a good quantity of <hi>Chervil,</hi> boil it in Meath or Fleſh-broath, and let the Patient drink a good draught of it warm, three times a day. Or let him drink a Thimble-full of <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> in Beer, adding a little Butter to it. Or take of <hi>Mumia</hi> half an ounce, or <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> two drachms, of <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Cancrorum</hi> (of which the blew ones, which ſometimes fall from Crafiſhes whilſt alive, are the beſt,) three drachms, adding to it a little Licoriſh and Cinnamon, and ſome Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil Roots: Of this pulveriſed give every day to the Patient, mornings and evenings, the weight of about half a ducat, and by this means you will expel purulent matter and blood, and bony ſplinters, and ſometimes even bullets lurking in the fleſh; not omitting other good Wound-drinks, and vulnerary Balſoms, Plaiſters, Ointments and Fomentations. Again, take of the red <hi>Hounds-tongue</hi> Ointment, of the bigneſs of a great Walnut, diſſolve it in warm Broath; it expels all coagulated blood, eſpecially if you mix ſome <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>If you have any Thorns, Thiſtles, Bullets, Small-ſhot, or the like, to draw out, where perhaps you cannot reach them with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then burn live Crafiſhes in a new Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, until they be reducible to powder, but burn them not to Aſhes. This powder mix with Hares-ſuet, and lay it on, and you will find a good effect. Alſo take the Roots of the big <hi>Reed</hi> that grows in Mariſhes, dry them to be pulveriſed, and mix Virgin-honey with it,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52336:286"/>
and lay it upon the part; and of the ſame powder give the Patient to drink, twice a day, the weight of half a ducat in Wine, or in Broath, or in a vulnerary potion, if you have at hand. The firſt of this I learned of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctor <hi>Schleer</hi> of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Excrement of a <hi>Gander,</hi> being applied, is alſo powerful in drawing out Iron. Again, Quince-wine mingled with Vinegar, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome Saffron and Gun-powder amongſt it, if you give it to one that hath been ſhot, it will do him good. Otherwiſe, they make a plaiſter of the Roots of <hi>Cumfrey, Aron, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody, Juniper,</hi> and dried <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> all reduced to powder, and mix it with Hares-ſuet and grey <hi>Diachylum,</hi> making a thick Ointment of it, and ſpreading it over a piece of Hare-skin, and ſo laying it on. This is greatly praiſed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſeconded with good Wound-drinks, of which <hi>Maſter-wort</hi> is one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients: But if you have not this at hand, take a <hi>Beet</hi> and boil it in Wine, and lay it warm on the wound. Likewiſe young Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, not yet fledge, burnt to powder, and this powder made by <hi>Acetum</hi> of Roſes into a pulſe, and laid on, does the ſame.</p>
                     <p>You ought alſo to be provided for the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novia</hi>: And if you proceed aright with my Wound-balſom above deſcribed, and keep the wound warm, you may therewith do much good. Mix with it, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> the red Earth of Vitriol, above diſcourſed of. This <hi>Synova</hi> is a dangerous thing, and often cauſeth almoſt intollerable pain, if it be not well handled; the Herb of Straw-berries and its
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52336:287"/>
Juyce have great vertue in this caſe. Some make uſe of the White of Eggs, Bol-Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, and the like. The Magiſtery of Allum alſo belongs hither; for, Allum mixed with Vinegar, and clapp'd on very warm, allays it alſo. Elder-bloſſoms likewiſe, uſed every way, are effectual in the ſame caſe. Employ alſo diligently ſuch Defenſive-plaiſters, as are not fatty, becauſe fat lays no hold on water.</p>
                     <p>To proceed to Burnings, I know almoſt no better Salve for burning than this; Take a <hi>Tench,</hi> or any common-Pond-fiſh; fry one or more of them with good Butter, pour the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon cold Water in a broad earthen Pan, and you have an excellent Ointment againſt Burnings. When, ſome years ſince, a Powder-Mill was blown up, and the Attendants upon the work ſo miſerably burnt, that they looked as if they had been roſted, they were healed with this Ointment, only a little finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Sage</hi> being mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>Cream and Linſeed-oyl mingled together, and raggs moiſten'd therein, put upon the burnt part, healeth, though the burning were made with <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi>; for, to my knowledge, a certain Chymiſt that had thus burnt all his Arm, was thereby reſtored. Or, take Oyl of Elder, or ſtale Oyl that hath been long in a burning Lamp; beat half as much, as you take of that, of the Whites of Eggs amongſt it, and anoint the burnt part therewith. If you can get no Oyl of Elder, take any other cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl, as of <hi>Nymphaea,</hi> (Water-lillies) <hi>Poppy-ſeeds, Violets</hi> or <hi>Roſes,</hi> or the Oyl of <hi>Poplar-buds,</hi> or of <hi>Marſh-Marigold</hi> Flowers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52336:287"/>If you can have Quince-wine, it marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly exſtinguiſhes the burning of any ſhot, dipping a Linnen pledget in it, and drawing it through the wound, or left in it, repeating this every twelfth hour. The Juyce or Wine of Quinces muſt be uſed as it comes from the fruit, without any mixture of Sugar. This I learn'd from a Nobleman, a great Souldier, of long experience in the Wars of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Jovis,</hi> made of <hi>Henbane, Vervain</hi> and <hi>Butter,</hi> is alſo very uſeful for this purpoſe. Likewiſe the Ointment of <hi>Calx viva,</hi> which is firſt ſix or ſeven times to be ſlaked and dulcified with pure water, pouring every twelve or ſixteen hours freſh water upon it, and decanting the former, ſo as to leave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the <hi>Calx</hi> at the bottom; which is then to be mixed with Oyl of Roſes, or ſome other cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl, for an Ointment.</p>
                     <p>If you be well acquainted with <hi>Elder,</hi> and know how to uſe it, you may obtain out of it one of the beſt Cures of Burnings, eſpecially out of its middle rinds. Again, Yolks of Eggs and Linſeed-oyl, equal quantities, mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpread over the burning, is alſo very good. Egg-oyl likewiſe uſed by it ſelf, and Vernice employed by Joyners, do well alſo; but the latter of theſe two, if it be mixed with Oyl of <hi>Spicanard</hi> or <hi>Petroleum,</hi> is to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled amongſt <hi>Linſeed-oyl.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Spread freſh Butter upon Cabbage-leaves, having firſt fryed the Butter with ſome bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms or the middle rind of <hi>Elder</hi>; and ſo lay them to the burning; <hi>Elder</hi> being a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſter
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52336:288"/>
of Inflammations, and therefore very good to allay <hi>St. Antonies fire</hi>; if you pull its mild green rinds from the ſtem, and lay them on, without moiſtening them. Elſe they uſe againſt the ſaid Fire, Flower mixed with the powder of Licorice, to be clapt on with a ragg done over with red <hi>Saunders.</hi> My way is, to take the ſhavings of ſome freſh and juycy Licorice, and to fry them in new Butter; then to ſtrain the Butter from it, and to fry the like freſh Licorice therein, and to ſtrain the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from that again; repeating this five or ſix times. Among this ſtrained Butter I ſtir ſome pure and fine <hi>Ceruſe,</hi> Whites of Eggs and a little Camphire. And with this Ointment I have, by the aſſiſtance of God, done much good in the ſaid inflammation of <hi>St. Antonies fire</hi>; and the common people do to this very day call this Ointment by no other name than that of Doctor <hi>Minderer</hi>'s <hi>Licorice-Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But to return to the quenching of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>If you can have Milk-cream, mingle it with Cow-dung freſhly made, and ſo clap it on; though freſh Cow-dung alone allays burning. <hi>Crafiſhes</hi> pounded alive, and fryed in freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or in common Suet, the Butter ſtrained here from, is alſo a good Ointment againſt burnings. Unſalted Lard, melted by a Wax-candle, or an hot Iron, and dropp'd upon freſh cold water, and then gather'd up from the water, and carefully rubbed from the ſame, hath the like operation. Take one of the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyls above-named, and freſh Butter, boil the middle rind of Elder in it, and with a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52336:288"/>
ſufficient quantity of Wax make of it a Salve, and this alſo will cure burning.</p>
                     <p>You ought alſo to be provided with a fit <hi>apparatus,</hi> Lints, Swathing-clouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to take Deer-ſuet, Oyl of Roſes or Elder, and white Wax, and melt them over the fire, yet ſo as that you melt the Wax, by it ſelf, and add of it no more to the reſt than to make it a thin plaiſter. Into this compound you muſt dip ſome fine lint, and you'l find it very uſeful for any angry part; as alſo when one limb preſſes or otherwiſe incommodes another, as happens in hydropical and other ſwollen people, whoſe belly ſo ſinks down, that the thighs ſuffer by it; in which caſe ſuch lints are to be put between the parts, to keep them from immediately touching and preſſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A grangrene</hi> is cured with Sal-armoniac boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Urine, eſpecially in that of the Patient, and clapping ſuch Urine upon the part affected:</p>
                     <p>The quantity of the Sal-armoniac may be ſix drachms.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>frozen Feet,</hi> take Gander-ſuet and Deer-ſuet; diſſolve them together, and pour them into a white excavated Turnip, and expoſe this for a while to the Air, Rain, Wind, Hoar-froſt, Snow, according as the ſeaſon ſhall be: Then mince the Turnip, and fry it in the ſame Suet which you had poured into it; that done, ſqueeze it out, and let the fat fall upon cold water; and being there brought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, take it off, and bring it over the helm from burned Wine, and decant this carefully from it again, and 'tis duely prepared. You
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52336:289"/>
may alſo recover frozen Feet with white rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Turnips, beaten with Butter or Tallow, and ſo clapt on.</p>

                     <p>THis Chapter I have annexed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as an <hi>Appendix,</hi> for the eaſe and good of Souldiers; wherein ſome things will occurr, not inferiour to thoſe that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded. But herein I have kept no order, but ſet them down promiſcuouſly, yet faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſupply what may have been omitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>If you be troubled with the <hi>Tooth-ach,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the cold in winter, take the root of <hi>Pyrethrum</hi> (Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi>) and boil it in Vinegar, and hold this Vinegar warm in your mouth, and it will draw out the phlegm that cauſes the pain. Or, take the root of Elder, boil it in half Wine and half Water, and hold it warm upon the Teeth. But what you take of this Decoction muſt be often ſpit out, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther freſh taken into you mouth; of which I have found wonderful Effects.</p>
                     <p>The root of <hi>Heath</hi> boiled together with the ſame herb in wine, and laid on is eſteem'd to be powerful in drawing out thorns and ſplinters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:52336:289"/>You may make a good Ointment againſt the <hi>Itch</hi> and <hi>Scabs,</hi> of <hi>Savin,</hi> ſtale Fat, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Juniper-berries Oyl.</p>
                     <p>If your Limbs after long ſickneſs be weak, boil <hi>Valerian</hi>-roots in Camomil-oyl, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint ſuch Limbs therewith. Alſo the Oyl of <hi>Lillies in the valley,</hi> and that of <hi>yellow Violets,</hi> is good for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>For worms in the Fingers, bruiſe <hi>Parſicaria</hi> (Arſmart,) and lay it on; or take of a Piggs Bladder of Gall, and put it on the affected Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger like a Thimble.</p>
                     <p>If you have any coagulated or congealed blood in your Breaſt, make a Decoction of <hi>Scabious, Chervil,</hi> and <hi>Germander,</hi> in two parts of wine, one part of water; and ſtrain it, and drink of it mornings and evenings.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the putrefaction of the Mouth, make a Decoction of <hi>Privet</hi> in water, adding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a little Allum to it, and uſe it for a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſm. Alſo a Decoction of the middle rind of <hi>Hawthorn,</hi> with a little Allum, is of great effect in the ſame caſe.</p>
                     <p>Cabbage and Colewort-leaves burnt to aſhes and a Lixivium made of it, and clapp'd on, cureth a Gangrene, and the wild Fire, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if you mingle a little Oyl of Elder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. If you can have no Elder-bloſſoms for this Oyl, take the green middle rind of Elder, and boil it in Oyl Olive, and then ſtrain the Oyl; which done, take freſh rind of Elder, and proceed with it as before, repeating it three or four times to make the Oyl the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. You may add a little wine to it whilſt 'tis boiling, but that muſt all boil away, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52336:290"/>
ſo long till the Oyl cracks no more in the fire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Southern-wood</hi> ſtamped with greaſe and laid on, draweth out ſplinters.</p>
                     <p>If you have the Itch or are ſcabby, and can light upon ſome water ſtanding in the hollowneſs of a <hi>Beech-tree,</hi> waſh your ſelf with it. Or make a Decoction of the brown rind of <hi>Alder,</hi> (which is under the gray,) in Butter, and anoint your ſelf with it; mixing, if you will a little Brimſtone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                     <p>If you be troubled with the <hi>Ring-worm,</hi> or any running Scab, infuſe Litharge in Vinegar, and let it ſtand a night infuſed, or make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the ſame in Vinegar. But your pain or veſſel muſt be of braſs. This Vinegar mingle with Oyl of Elder, or of Roſes, or the like, and it will become a fine gray Salve, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch running Scabs as aforeſaid, and cooling alſo Inflammations.</p>
                     <p>If your Body be bound, take <hi>Sage</hi> pulveriſed and mix it with greaſe, and anoint your Navil with the quantity of a haſel-nut of it. This I have with very good ſucceſs adviſed to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in child-bed, that were thus bound and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. If you will have it ſtronger, mix with it the Gall of a Fiſh or of any Animal whatſoever; but then you muſt not give it to a woman in child-bed.</p>

                        <hi>Gromel</hi> (by the <hi>Latins</hi> call'd <hi>Milium Solis</hi>) pulveriſed, and the weight of half a ducat of it taken in wine or broath, provoketh urine; yet muſt the belly be open'd firſt. The ſame doth <hi>Linaria</hi> or <hi>Toad-flax,</hi> boiled in wine

or broath. Likewiſe diſtilled water of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes, repeating the diſtillation ſeveral times from other freſh Radiſhes. Which will have the better effect, if the Patient bath his lower parts in a bath made of <hi>Marſh-mallows, Melilot,</hi> and the like.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gromel,</hi> above-mention'd, taken in warm broath, expels the birth: And ſo do the bloſſoms or buds of Walnut-trees; Crabs-eyes alſo, pulveriſed and taken in warm broath; likewiſe <hi>Iſſop</hi> boiled in wine, and drank warm. This I have inſerted for the ſake of poor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers-wives, who amongſt us often follow the Camp. If they have any great After-pains, let them bath their lower parts in a Bath made of <hi>Dill,</hi> and <hi>Camomil</hi>-flowers. And the yolks of hard Eggs, beaten together with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Oyl (Nut-oyl is the beſt,) and a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter made of it, and laid to the belly, is alſo very good. If they have too great a profuſion of blood, let them take a drachm of burnt Harts-horn, and burnt Ivory, in a convenient Vehicle.</p>
                     <p>In caſe of a mortal wound, take of pure Turpentine four ounces, waſh it with freſh limpid water, and then diſſolve it over a mild fire; which done, mix with it two ounces or two ounces and an half of white Wax, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved apart: To this add about three ounces of Womans milk, which is ſucked by a Boy.
