         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHat ≈øhould be the ≈øcope of putting forth this my not ≈øufficient Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed Treati≈øe, after ≈øo many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Learned Writings of <hi>Phy≈øicians,</hi> the Title before will declare unto thee, <hi>viz.</hi> That my De≈øign was both out of the Ancient and Modern, to extract the very Marrow, and plainly to ≈øhew the be≈øt way of Curing Di≈øea≈øes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Chirurgery: Therefore I have purpo≈øed not to obtrude upon thee this or that Man's Fancy,
<pb facs="tcp:52336:3"/>
or Conceit, for Modern Practice: For who ever was ≈øo mad as to Embrace the Opinion of any one Region, City, or Man? Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though mo≈øt ingenious and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, equally excelled in all the Parts of his Profe≈ø≈øion? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath not plea≈øed the Giver of all Arts to grant this perfectne≈øs to Men: But I re≈øolve to ≈øet down that Practice which Rea≈øon and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, after a diligent Reading of the be≈øt Authors, and an exact ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ≈øeveral Operations, have Taught me to be the ≈øafe≈øt, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niente≈øt and ea≈øie≈øt, for prolixity I have purpo≈øely avoided, and u≈øed not more words than only to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs the thing it ≈øelf. Neverthele≈øs I have ≈øtudied to conprehend the Foundation of the Art in few Chapters. Read over all diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let not what I purpo≈øely
<pb facs="tcp:52336:3"/>
omitted trouble thee: Great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns ea≈øily affright the Reader, as tho≈øe that are too little betrays him: I have carefully endeavoured, what is hardly found, a mean; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have rather in few words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerted my Ob≈øervations, in the very de≈øcriptions of the Di≈øea≈øes, then to wa≈øte thy time with a prolix di≈øcour≈øe: To this end, that I might not repeat in particular Di≈øea≈øes, what I had once ≈øet down in generals.</p>

                     <hi>Tumors, Wounds,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>lcers,</hi> which neither in Cau≈øe nor Cure differ, I have reduced under one Head, contrary to what mo≈øt Writers u≈øe to do, who only from the difference of the Part and Member affected, difference the Di≈øea≈øes, which aftewards gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them new names, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any benefit multiply, and ≈øo

they render that Art which is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult enough of it ≈øelf, much more difficult. The mo≈øt diligent of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents can ≈øcarce di≈øtingui≈øh them, who unprofitably ≈øpend much labour and time, in the Controver≈øies of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients concerning the Name, who≈øe Opinions they ≈øuppo≈øe they ought to follow to a Tittle, if they will arrive at the degree of Doctor.

                  </p>
                  <p>I have ≈øet down both few, and many Medicaments; for tho≈øe that I have produced, although few in number, yet of great vertue, which by va≈øt pains, and no le≈øs charges I have found out, and which dayly

                     <p>ALthough the word <hi>Chirurgery</hi> ≈øignifies all <hi>Manual Operations</hi> in general; yet, by rea≈øon of its pre-eminence above all the re≈øt, it is now only given to that <hi>Art,</hi> which endeavours to remove the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øea≈øes of the Body, by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>Hands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that External Accidents require not only the help of the <hi>Hands,</hi> but al≈øo <hi>Internal</hi> Means; therefore it is no wonder for a Part of Phy≈øick to require the whole: <hi>Chirurgery</hi> being a Part, which depends upon the Body of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick</hi>: But the≈øe internal Medicines we impart to you, not as <hi>Chirurgeons,</hi> but as <hi>Phy≈øicians.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Fracture is a Solution of Continuity in the hard parts of the Body, cau≈øed by an hard In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment externally forced upon the part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, 1. From the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; there being ≈øome tran≈øver≈øe, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Fractures</hi>; others that are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the length of the Bone, called <hi>Fi≈ø≈øures</hi>: and others are <hi>Comminutions,</hi> when the Bone is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52336:9"/>
broken into many ≈ømall parts. 2. From the <hi>Part,</hi> it being ≈øome times in the Head, ≈øometimes in the Shoulders, Ribs, Arms, Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. From the <hi>Accidents</hi>; there being ≈øometimes a Wound accompanying it; at other times, a Di≈ølocation, Inflamation, Gangrene, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cau≈øe</hi>] is, Whatever is able to break, brui≈øe, or cut: Sometimes al≈øo a Bone corrupted by the Pox, Gout, or otherwi≈øe, hath been broken without any external force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] A Bone being tran≈øver≈øly or oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke, by handling it, you perceive an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality; the Patient is ≈øcarce able to move the Part affected, and ≈øometimes that Part is ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the other; the Thigh, Leg or Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, the Patient cannot ≈øtand at all; but he may ≈øomewhat, though with pain, in a Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>location: And this is the ≈øure≈øt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Fracture and a Di≈ølocation. A <hi>Fi≈ø≈øure</hi> is di≈øcerned by the thickne≈øs, pain and uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the Part, and requireth the judgment of a skilful Chirurgion. A <hi>Comminution</hi> is ea≈øie to be perceived, the Bone being very unequal, and here and there yielding to the Fingers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progno≈øticks</hi>] A <hi>Tran≈øver≈øe</hi> Fracture is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie to cure than an <hi>Oblique</hi>; or when accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with apparent Inequalities; <hi>that,</hi> where but one Bone is broken, than where two are, or where the Bones are much ≈øhattered; <hi>that,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s made in the mid≈øt of the Bone, than what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be near the Head; and a ≈øingle one, than a compound. If the Patient remain undre≈ø≈øed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ≈øeventh day, the Member is in danger of mortifying, e≈øpecially if that the Part be too <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                        </gap>ard bound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52336:10"/>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] A broken Bone requires the≈øe four Operations; <hi>Extention, Conjoining, Ligature, Well-placing</hi>; and withal, the application of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward Remedies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Extention</hi> can hardly be performed without pain; which yet will be much le≈øs, if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be ≈øo extended, that the Mu≈øcles do not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; that is to ≈øay, The Part mu≈øt be ≈øo laid, that when <hi>in health,</hi> they could hold out longe≈øt without tiring. Sometimes the exten≈øion mu≈øt be greater, ≈øometimes le≈ø≈øer; which will be performed aright, if regard be had to the time of the Fracture, to the Age of the Patient, and to the greatne≈øs of the Bone. A recent Fracture, a tender Patient, a ≈ømall Bone, require a gentler Extention: on the contrary, an old Fracture, a ≈øtrong Patient, and a big Bone, a greater. The manner of extending I de≈øcribe not, becau≈øe it is better learnt by the frequent view of Practice, than by Reading.</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Extention,</hi> you are to join the Bones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; in the doing of which, the Mu≈øcles mu≈øt not be wre≈øted, but retain their natural po≈øition and figure.</p>
                     <p>Then the Part mu≈øt be bound with a double Rowler; the <hi>fir≈øt</hi> is to be rowled thrice about the Fracture, and then upwards. The <hi>(≈øecond</hi> (which mu≈øt be twice as long) is to be once wound about the Fracture, proceeding down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and then upwards again, a little higher than the fir≈øt Rowler; to which you will give more firmne≈øs, if you bind ≈øome convenient Splints (of Wood, or rather of Pa≈øt-board) round about the Member.</p>
                     <p>The Ligature ought not to be too ≈øtrait, le≈øt it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52336:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cau≈øe pain, and rob the Part of its nouri≈øhment; nor too loo≈øe, le≈øt the Bones ≈ølip out of their place. And unle≈øs great pain, or other ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms require, it mu≈øt not be opened before the <hi>third</hi> day; and at the <hi>≈øecond</hi> dre≈ø≈øing, it mu≈øt be bound ≈øomewhat clo≈øer; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards changed but once every four, five or ≈øix dayes.</p>
                     <p>La≈øtly, The Part ought to be <hi>well placed,</hi> that is, ≈øoftly, evenly, and a little rai≈øed. If you lay it too low, the Bone will bend outwards; if too high, it will bend inwards: Wherefore you mu≈øt ob≈øerve a mean.</p>
                     <p>Now, whether the≈øe four Operations have been duly performed, may be known by the en≈øuing Signs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Extention</hi> is well done, if the part be ≈øtrait, and as long as its fellow; if it appear to outward view every where even, and a little hollow about the Fracture.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>joining together</hi> is duly made, if the Bone be any thing firm, and all about the Fracture be found equal.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ligature</hi> is as it ought to be, if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as ≈øoon as he is dre≈ø≈øed, find the pain aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; if the pain do ≈øomewhat encrea≈øe the fir≈øt and ≈øecond night, and there be perceived the third day, without the place of binding, a little ≈øwelling yielding to your hands.</p>
                     <p>The Bone is <hi>well placed,</hi> if in the ≈øecond dre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing you find all even.</p>
                     <p>Before you rowl the Ligature about the Member, bathe the part with Spirit of Wine or Red Wine; or, with Oyl, Wine and Vinegar mix'd together; Or, take the White of an Egg,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52336:11"/>
with ≈øome Bolus, Frankincen≈øe, Dragons-Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or anoint it with Oyl of Ro≈øes, Mirtles, Violets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or lay Plai≈øters on it. In Winter, the <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> will do well: At all times that which follows;</p>
                     <p>Take Ma≈øtick, Frankincen≈øe, of each two drams, Aloes, Gum Tragacanth, Dragons-Blood, Bole-Armonick, of each a one dram; <hi>Lapis Haematitis,</hi> Burnt Talch, of each one dram; Whites of Eggs, and Oyl of Ro≈øes, as much as is ≈øufficient. Make it into a Plai≈øter.</p>
                     <p>If a <hi>Wound</hi> accompany the Fracture, then ought you to extend the Part fir≈øt (yet ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what gentler than in a ≈øimple Fracture) then you are to join the Bones together; next, to ob≈øerve the Wound, to bring the Lips thereof together with Plai≈øters, rather than with a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and to guard it with a Defen≈øive: And la≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rowl the Part, and lay it conveniently.</p>
                     <p>If there be a <hi>Cominution,</hi> or great ≈øhattering of the Bones joined with the Wound, then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with Forceps to remove the ≈ømall loo≈øe Bones, leaving tho≈øe to Nature that are yet any way fixed; for ≈øhe will, though ≈øomewhat later, of her ≈øelf throw them out; and ≈øometimes ≈øhe will unite them again to the whole. Yet, to forward her, you may a≈ø≈øi≈øt Nature with the following Medicaments.</p>
                     <p>Take A≈øhes of Earth-worms, three drams; Virgins-Honey, an ounce and half, mix them, and make an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Aloes, Myrrhe, of each half a dram; Roots of Comfrey the great, Round-Birthwort, of each three drams, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> two drams;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52336:11"/>
Turpentine and Wax, as much as is ≈øufficient, with a little Oyl of Lillies, to make it into an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>If the Bone be <hi>bare,</hi> cover it with its own skin and Nu≈øcles, and defend it from the Air as much as is po≈ø≈øible.</p>
                     <p>If it be <hi>bare</hi> and al≈øo <hi>≈øtarted out,</hi> endeavour to reduce it again into its place; but if it be got out too far, take away the pieces thus ≈øtarted out, with Saw or Nippers.</p>
                     <p>Now the≈øe Manual Operations being well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Patient mu≈øt ob≈øerve a good Diet; open a Vein upon occa≈øion, and afterwards purge the Blood. In the Fractures of the lower parts, purging is not convenient; but if the Patients Belly be bound, he mu≈øt take a Suppo≈øitory.</p>
                     <p>In the Fractures of the upper parts, Purging or admini≈øtring Cly≈øters, is oftner nece≈ø≈øary, and may be done by the en≈øuing compounded or ≈øimple Medicines, which may al≈øo ≈øerve you in all other Accidents that we may de≈øcribe in this whole Treati≈øe.</p>

whole within: Which yet in little Children may be done without a Fracture.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fracture</hi> is made, when a part of the Skull is ≈øeparated from the whole.</p>
                     <p>An <hi>Inci≈øion</hi> is made by a cutting In≈øtrument; where ≈øometimes one part of the Bone is rais'd up and ≈øeparated, as it were, but is yet fa≈øt to the re≈øt of the Bone; ≈øometimes a part is quite taken away; ≈øometimes there remains a mark in the Bone according to the Figure of the In≈øtrument.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Puncture</hi> is made by a pungent or thru≈øting In≈øtrument, and ≈øeldom pa≈ø≈øeth through both Tables.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Contra-fi≈ø≈øure</hi> is made, when the part ≈øtruck remaining whole, the oppo≈øite part is cleft.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs</hi> are, Swimming of the Head, dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the Eyes, Vomiting, Bleeding at the Mouth, No≈øe and Ears. The Patient grows dumb, and ≈øuddenly falls to the ground: whereupon follows Raving, a Feaver, Convul≈øions, Pal≈øie. Any hard thing, as a piece of Wood, a Spoon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being put into his Mouth, he is not at all, or hardly able to bite upon it. Here it mu≈øt al≈øo be carefully enquired, in what manner, and with what In≈øtrument he hath been hurt? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be young or old, tender or ≈øtrong, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or unhealthy? Pre≈øently after the Fall or Stroke, before the Part ≈øwells, you may ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feel the hurt with your Fingers; and if there be a Wound with it, you may either ≈øee it, or find it out with a <hi>Probe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progno≈øticks.</hi>] The Fractures of the Skull, how fair ≈øoever they may look, is never without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but more dangerous, when both the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are hurt or broken; and more dangerous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52336:16"/>
yet, if the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and mo≈øt dangerous, if the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> be al≈øo hurt. The more Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms there are, the le≈øs hope of a good event. If the Bone grow black in the beginning, that is a mortal Sign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] If the Skin be yet whole, or the wound not large enough, make a cro≈øs inci≈øion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> If under it you find a fi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, put ≈øome Ink into it, and bind up the wound. The ≈øecond day, or as ≈øoon as the bleeding is cea≈øed, ≈øcrape the Skull at once, or at ≈øeveral times, until the Ink with the Fi≈ø≈øure is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gone, and the Bone grow ≈øomewhat bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then throw the en≈øuing Powder upon it.</p>
                     <p>Take Dragons Blood, burnt Harts-horn, of each one dram and half; Myrrhe half a dram; Frankincen≈øe, and Orri≈øe roots, of each a dram; Make it into a very fine Powder.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Fi≈ø≈øure</hi> pa≈øs through both Tables, then are you to make u≈øe of Trepanning; as likewi≈øe in the <hi>Contra-fi≈ø≈øure, Fracture</hi> and <hi>Contu≈øion</hi> of the Skull, or el≈øe you will quickly lo≈øe your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Inci≈øion</hi> is healed like the <hi>Fi≈ø≈øure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Puncture</hi> you mu≈øt put the Trepan ju≈øt in the middle, and not on the ≈øides of the place hurt.</p>
                     <p>If you find a Fracture with a Cominution, then take out all the ≈ømall loo≈øe Bones, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Nature tho≈øe that are yet fa≈øt to the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium,</hi> or cannot be taken away without force. And then if the Fracture be ≈øo large, that you can free the Brains from the coagulated or corrupted Blood, or from the pricking Bones, Trepanning will be needle≈øs; but if it ≈øhould happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52336:16"/>
you mu≈øt, with great care, apply the Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, unle≈øs the Patient be ≈øtrong, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very little. The manner of Trepanning will be taught in another place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In a Fracture of the No≈øe, what is rai≈øed, is to be pre≈ø≈øed down; and what is pre≈ø≈øed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to be rai≈øed with a <hi>Spatule,</hi> or other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument: afterwards a Pipe or Quill is to be put up, and continually kept there, till the Cure be done, and a Fracture-Plai≈øter is to be laid on without. If the Bone be not corrupted, it will be healed in ten or twelve days.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A broken <hi>Jaw-bone</hi> is re≈øtored by ones fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers u≈øed both within and without the Mouth; and if tho≈øe be too weak, then one is to draw the Head backward, and the Chirurgeon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ≈øo to put it in. It is cured in twenty days.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Clavicle</hi> being broken, there mu≈øt be one to draw the Arm backward, and another to draw the Neck or Shoulder forward; the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon him≈øelf, in the mean time, drawing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what was fallen down, and downwards what was rai≈øed too high. If a Ball be put into the Arm-pit, and the Elbow be pre≈ø≈øed again≈øt the Ribs, the Operation will prove more ea≈øie. It is cured in twenty four days.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If the <hi>Shoulder-Blade</hi> be broken about the place where it is united to the <hi>Arm,</hi> then is the hurt for the mo≈øt part incurable. If it break in the <hi>Acromion</hi> (which may be ea≈øily felt) then let the Arm or Shoulder be pulled down, either with Hands or Ligatures, and in the mean time ≈øet it in. If it be broken into ≈øeveral pieces, make an Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and take them out, unle≈øs they be yet fa≈øt to the <hi>Peri-e≈øtium</hi>; in which ca≈øe, you mu≈øt leave
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52336:17"/>
Nature to her ≈øelf, which will either make them unite again, or throw them out. It is healed in forty days.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Sternum,</hi> or Brea≈øt-bone happens ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>broken,</hi> and then you'll find an uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, which being toucht, will yield to the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and cau≈øe ≈øome cracking; or to be pre≈ø≈øed in, and then you'll feel a bending inwards, which will cau≈øe pain, a ≈øhort breath, coughing and ≈øpitting blood. To re≈øtore the ≈øame, lay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient on his Back upon a great ≈øtone, pre≈ø≈øing both his Shoulders downwards; then pre≈øs the Ribs backward and forward, until the Bone be reduced again in its right place. This is cured in twenty days.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. A ≈øimple Fracture of the <hi>Ribs,</hi> which is without any great Contu≈øion, or Inflamation of the neighbouring parts, may be healed in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, applying the Fracture-Plai≈øter. If the Ribs ≈øtand out, they mu≈øt with ones Hand be pre≈ø≈øed in. If they bend inward, let the Patient keep in his Breath, and ≈øo pre≈øs the Rib outward; in the mean time, a≈ø≈øi≈øting him with your hand. If that ≈øucceed not, then lay a ≈øticking Plai≈øter upon it, and pull the ≈øame off ≈øo often, until the Rib return into its place. Cupping-Gla≈ø≈øes here are of no u≈øe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. A ≈øimple Fracture of the Joynts of the <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> is ea≈øily ≈øet again with ones finger, and is made whole in twenty days. But if the Marrow of the Back-bone be ≈øo hurt or pre≈ø≈øed in, that the Arms or Legs of the Patient become lame or ≈øen≈øele≈øs, that he cannot retain his Urine, or his Excrement, then he ≈øeldom e≈øcapeth death. Yet you are to do your utmo≈øt; and if one or more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52336:17"/>
≈ømall Bones be altogether loo≈øe from the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o≈øtium,</hi> then make Inci≈øion, and take them out.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The ≈øame is to be under≈øtood of the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the <hi>Os ≈øacrum,</hi> which alone hath this peculiar, that you may put your fingers into the <hi>Anus,</hi> and re≈øtore it to its right place.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Hip-bone</hi> being broken, is to be ≈øet as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible may be, and then it will heal in twenty four days; otherwi≈øe you may expect various accidents. But if it be fractured into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pieces, then you are forthwith, in the fir≈øt dre≈ø≈øing, to make an Inci≈øion; take out the ≈ømall Splinters, and re-place tho≈øe that have yet any hold-fa≈øt. Yet, by rea≈øon of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Tendons, Mu≈øcles, Veins, Arteries and Nerves, that are ≈øpread over the whole part, ≈øuch an Inci≈øion cannot be made without great danger.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. If the <hi>upper-Bone</hi> of the <hi>Arm</hi> be broken, fir≈øt bend the Elbow toward the Brea≈øt, then take the lower part of that Bone clo≈øe to the Elbow, pulling it ≈øtraight down towards the ground, and ≈øo re≈øtore it; well ob≈øerving here, that the Arm, during the whole time of Cure, mu≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that po≈øture in which it was extended; otherwi≈øe the Fracture will, upon the lea≈øt change of its po≈øture, ≈ølip out again. Where yet 'tis to be under≈øtood, that the Chirurgeon after the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third dre≈ø≈øing, as often as after that he dre≈ø≈øeth the Patient, mu≈øt ≈øtretch out his Arm ≈øtrait, to the end that the Tendons which run from the Arm, and are in≈øerted below the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, ≈øhrinking by the long lying ≈øtill, may not cau≈øe a trouble≈øome ≈øtiffne≈øs. However, this ≈øhrinking of <hi>Tendons</hi> (which are by pretenders to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52336:18"/>
Chirurgery, ridiculou≈øly call'd <hi>Nerves</hi>) may yet conveniently be cured in two or three months, if you make the Patient to carry every day ≈øome weight, and endeavor to relax and mollifie the Tendons with Fomentations and Embrocations, ab≈øtaining from the u≈øe of any Brandy, or any other corroborating and a≈øtringent Medicines. I have always found ≈øucce≈øsful the following Unguent.</p>
                     <p>Take Man's and Duck's Grea≈øe, of each one ounce; Oyntment of Mar≈øh-mallows, half an ounce; Oyl of Earth-worms, white Lilly, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile, of each two drams. Make an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>broken Bone</hi> is cured in forty days. The re≈øtoring of the broken Thigh-bone, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from this.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The <hi>Elbow</hi> hath two Bones; of which, the greater is called <hi>Radius,</hi> the le≈ø≈øer <hi>Ulna</hi>; both <hi>Fociles</hi>: The ≈ømall <hi>Focile</hi> being broken, 'tis ea≈øie to re≈øtore it. The Cure is harder, when the great one is broken; and yet harder, when both are broken: In which ca≈øe, the extention is to be made the ≈øtronger. When they be well ≈øet, and bound up, then mu≈øt the hand be placed a little higher upon the Che≈øt than the Elbow; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, every ≈øecond or third day (without pain or violence) the Arm is gently to be ≈øtretch'd out, to the end that the Humors flowing thither, and there ≈øtaying too long, may not cau≈øe a concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Bones, and a ≈øtiffne≈øs in the Arm, as not exten≈øible any more. It is cured in thirty days.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The <hi>Leg</hi> hath al≈øo two Bones, the greater called <hi>Tibia,</hi> and the le≈ø≈øer <hi>Fibula.</hi> Their Cure had nothing different from the next foregoing.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. If the <hi>Patella,</hi> or Knee-pan, break cro≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52336:18"/>
the Patient commonly remains lame. If it break long-ways, then by the Mu≈øcles that draw upwards, without any great help of the hands, it is almo≈øt of it ≈øelf re≈øtored, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in twenty days.</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Di≈ølocation is a forcing of the Bone out of its cavity and natural place into another, hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voluntary motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, 1. From the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; for ≈øometimes the Bone is altogether forced out of its place, and that is properly called <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> or <hi>Di≈ølocation:</hi> Sometimes it is got out but a little or half, which is called Sub-laxation, or <hi>Elongation.</hi> 2. From the <hi>Cau≈øe</hi>; for ≈øometimes it is from an external accident, as by wre≈øtlings, Falls, or Blows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes from internal Cau≈øes, by the afflux of Humors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cau≈øes</hi> are of two ≈øorts; 1. <hi>External,</hi> Such as are Falling, Beating, Running, Wre≈øtling, and vehement extention, as it often happens to Women in Labour, through the unskilfulne≈øs of Midwives; yea, by a violent ≈øtroke or fall, even the Bones of the Infant in the Womb, may be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located. 2. <hi>Internal,</hi> By the afflux of Humors, which falling into the Joints, relax and re≈øolve the Ligaments, and ≈øo cau≈øeth the Bones to ≈ølip out of their places.</p>

                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52336:19"/>The <hi>Signs,</hi> e≈øpecially in a lean Body, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øt enough. The Bone cau≈øeth in the place to <hi>which</hi> it is forced, a tumor or ri≈øing; and in that <hi>whence</hi> it is forced, a cavity.

                     <p>HAving thus roughly handled the boney and hard parts of the Body, it now follows, that I treat the ≈øoft and fle≈øhie more gently, and de≈øcribe their <hi>Synthe≈øis</hi> or re-unition again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin with the broken <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> which ≈øometimes gives way to the Inte≈øtines, at other times to the Cawl, and not ≈øeldom to both, to get out of their natural place into the Groins or <hi>Scrotum,</hi> there cau≈øing a Rupture called <hi>Entorocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Inte≈øtinalis,</hi> if the Guts come out; an <hi>Epiplocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Omentalis,</hi> if the <hi>Omentum</hi> or Cawl be out.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> is made up of two ≈øtrong, but ≈øoft Membranes, which do ≈øo contain what≈øoever is included in the Belly or lowe≈øt Cavity, that when ≈øound, nothing can fall out.

The Groins therefore are the u≈øual places of Ruptures: But do not imagine, that the <hi>Peritonoeum</hi> cannot be di≈øtended or bur≈øt in other places, and there to cau≈øe a Rupture.

                        <p>Among the≈øe Ruptures is to be reckoned the <hi>Navel-Rupture</hi> (called <hi>Exomphalos,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilicalis</hi>) which proceeds from the ≈øame cau≈øe, and is cured by the ≈øame means: Only you are here to ob≈øerve, That upon the Plai≈øter, you mu≈øt put Bol≈øters of Leather, or other hard things, and this according to the bigne≈øs of the Rupture; that by this means it may be ≈øufficiently and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly kept in.</p>
                        <p>It is worthy nothing that the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom bur≈øts in this part.

≈øo to be lacerated, that the Guts pre≈øs not into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> but between the Skin and Mu≈øcles falls down toward the Thigh.

                     <p>To cure this Di≈øea≈øe, lay the Patient on her back, with her Knees on high, and Legs a≈øunder; then take a Wax-Candle of a competent thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, mix therewith ≈øome <hi>Ca≈øtoreum</hi> or <hi>A≈ø≈øa Foeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and with it gently pre≈øs the Womb inward, and having ≈øa≈øtened the Candle with a Bandage,

                     <p n="4">4. For <hi>Refrigeration,</hi> when the heat of the Blood is ≈øo exce≈ø≈øive, that it cannot be allayed by cooling Medicines, or not time enough.</p>

                     <p>But I much wi≈øh, 1. That they could make this di≈øcharge without the lo≈øs of that ≈øtrength which is ≈øo highly nece≈ø≈øary. 2. That they would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent when their Patient is to bleed, and preci≈øely tell to what degree of <hi>corruption</hi> his blood is come, that ≈øo the Chirurgeon may know how much of it he is to take, and how often; fora≈ømuch as they will not allow, that Bleeding is good in all ≈øorts of the Blood's corruption, but in that only which is not gone con≈øiderably far. 3. That they would declare, why they will have cur'd the greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by Purging, and the le≈ø≈øer by Bleeding, ≈øince that they give to the one as well as to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (and that duly) the name of <hi>Cacho-Chimia.</hi>

Let them ≈øhew, that things differing only <hi>≈øecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Majus &amp; Minus,</hi> do differ in <hi>≈øpecie,</hi> and ≈øo require ≈øpecifically different Remedies.</p>
                     <p>Others proceed yet further, and ≈øhed innocent Blood in all ≈øorts of Fevers, without any con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ≈øpots of the Plague, or of Poi≈øon it ≈øelf; thus freeing them≈øelves from a great deal of labor and trouble, otherwi≈øe caus'd to the <hi>Phy≈øitian</hi> from the variety of Fevers. But becau≈øe the nature of all Poy≈øon and Malignant Humors is continually to a≈ø≈øault the Heart, and ≈øuddenly to pro≈øtrate the ≈øtrength of the ≈øtronge≈øt Per≈øons; and ≈øince Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth likewi≈øe <hi>both,</hi> not only dimini≈øhing ≈øtrength, but al≈øo drawing the malignity toward the Heart, and driving in again, for the oppre≈ø≈øion of Nature, what ≈øhe had thrown out for her relief: I do intreat and warn all the Practi≈øers of our Art, That as they love the quiet of their Mind, and the good of their Patients, they would beware of bleeding in Pe≈øtilential and other Malignant Fevers; as al≈øo in all ca≈øes that may befal People by Poy≈øon, either inward or outward.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>French, Italians, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugue≈øes</hi> (great Blood-letters) will, I expect, tell me; That Nature, when by bleeding ≈øhe hath vent, and is ≈øomewhat di≈øcharg'd, ≈øhall be better able to throw out the remaining Evil. And this ≈øeems to be true, for the blood indeed receives Air, that the Spirits may the better flie away, and is robb'd of that ≈øtrength which it ≈øo nece≈ø≈øarily wants; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nature exchangeth the Life of the Patient for death, and extorts tears from the By-≈øtanders.</p>
                     <p>Without alledging other Rea≈øons, they ground them≈øelves upon Experience. And it were to be wi≈øhed they had that ground indeed; for we find
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52336:30"/>
≈øuch Patients of theirs, who in the morning were in no danger, even after but the taking away of five or ≈øix ounces of Blood, to be cold and ≈øtiff at night. Whence it may ea≈øily be collected, what it is they call <hi>Experience, viz.</hi> If the Patient by chance e≈øcape death, then <hi>Bleeding</hi> mu≈øt have the honor of it; but if he die, as for the mo≈øt part, then the malignity of the Di≈øea≈øe was the cau≈øe of it.

                     <p>The more moderate ≈øort of them would have <hi>Bleeding</hi> only admini≈øtred in the beginning of the Di≈øea≈øe, and before the Malignity appears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.

If the humors flying to the head, cau≈øe any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ≈øymptoms there; in which ca≈øe, bleeding in the Hand or Foot may be, I think, very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.

But enough of this.</p>
                     <p>Now how <hi>many Ounces</hi> of Blood ought to be taken at once; the degree of the Di≈øea≈øe, and the Patients more or le≈øs ≈øtrength, will indicate. And 'tis better too little than too much. I have never taken more from the ≈øtronge≈øt and mo≈øt plethoric

Per≈øon under my Cure, than twelve ounces at once, chu≈øing rather, in ca≈øe of need, to let out twenty ounces at two times, than fifteen at once; of which method I have found good ≈øucce≈øs.</p>

                     <p>The veins that are wont commonly to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the≈øe: In the Forehead, the <hi>Vena frontis</hi>; in the Temples, the <hi>Vena Temporalis</hi>; in the Mouth, the <hi>Vena ≈øublingualis,</hi> or <hi>Ranularis</hi>; in the Neck, the <hi>Jugularis externa</hi>; in the Arm, the <hi>Ba≈øilica,</hi> under which lieth an Artery; the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi> under which lieth a Nerve, and under both of them a Tendon; and the <hi>Cephalica,</hi> which hath under, or near it, neither Artery, Nerve, nor Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and therefore may ≈øafely be opened: This la≈øt hath but one ≈ømall Branch that runs outward to the head, whence it hath got the name of the <hi>Head Vein.</hi> Without this con≈øideration, it little matters which of the≈øe three be opened, in regard that about the Arm-pits they all acknowledge no more but one Branch.

                     <p>The <hi>manner</hi> of Bleeding is ≈øo well known, that I think it needle≈øs here to de≈øcribe it; only I could wi≈øh, that ≈øome of tho≈øe that let blood, would take care ≈øomewhat better to gue≈øs of the number of Ounces of Blood they take from their Patients, that ≈øo we might not find 12, 16, 18, yea, 22 ounces drawn away in≈øtead of 6 or 8, that

When the matter being very ≈øharp or malign, upon which happens a Corro≈øion of the neighboring parts, and a corruption of the Bones, Tendons or Nerves. 2. When it may affect a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler part. 3. When it lieth in the Joynts. 4. When it is ca≈øt out by a <hi>Cri≈øis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before you proceed to the opening, you are to con≈øider, whether the matter be contain'd <hi>in its own proper Tunicle,</hi> or whether it be without any <hi>Tunicle.</hi> If <hi>without</hi> any, then make your aperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with a right Line, ob≈øerving the Fibres of the Mu≈øcles. <hi>For Example</hi>; In the head, according to the po≈øition of the Hair, long-ways; in the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, tran≈øver≈øe; in the Temples, the No≈øe, Neck, Brea≈øt, Back, Arms, Feet, Joynts, long-ways;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52336:31"/>
in the mid≈øt of the Abdomen, let it be long-ways; in the ≈øides of it ≈øomewhat oblique; in the Groins, tran≈øver≈øe; but not very deep, by ≈øea≈øon of the ≈øubjacent ≈øeminary Ve≈ø≈øels. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beware of touching any great Vein, Artery or Nerve, though the Fibres be cut a-cro≈øs, le≈øt from a le≈ø≈øer evil there ≈øhould ari≈øe a greater.</p>
                     <p>The propere≈øt place for the opening, is the mo≈øt rai≈øed and ≈øofte≈øt part of the Ab≈øce≈øs, if po≈ø≈øible in the depending, that the purulent matter may the more conveniently be di≈øchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: To which end al≈øo you are with a Tent ≈øo long to keep open the wound, until the part, being altogether clean≈øed of its preternatural Humors, may return to its former Functions.</p>
                     <p>In the opening, thru≈øt not in the Launcet too deep, nor further into the Cavity than to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and as ≈øoon as you perceive <hi>that,</hi> draw it a little back, and turn the point upward; making your opening through the Skin ≈øo big as may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the contained matter a free vent.</p>
                     <p>If the Ab≈øce≈øs be included in a Tunicle, if ≈ømall, make the Inci≈øion long ways; if big, then make a double inci≈øion, that is, cro≈øs-ways; and beware of touching the Ve≈øicle, otherwi≈øe you mu≈øt expect a foetide and almo≈øt incurable Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This being well done, pre≈øs out with your Fingers the Ve≈øicle, which ≈øeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øticks to the Skin, and ea≈øily follows; cut off the little Artery by which it is fed; and have a care, that not the lea≈øt Particle of the Bag may remain on it, le≈øt it gather again.</p>
                     <p>Fora≈ømuch as in this Operation I find, that Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons differ in the <hi>In≈øtrument</hi> they ought to u≈øe, ≈øome chu≈øing the <hi>Launcet,</hi> others the <hi>Potential Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:52336:32"/>
and extol it far above the former: I think my ≈øelf obliged to declare here what I judge of this matter.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Potential Cautery</hi> hath this Advantage, that it doth not terrifie timorous Patients, nor is painful to the tender; e≈øpecially joyning with it the pre≈øent and known good Remedies: For <hi>unquenched Lime,</hi> mixed with <hi>Holland Sope,</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deep enough into the fle≈øh, yet much gentli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Corro≈øive of <hi>Ambr. Paraeus.</hi> But it hath the≈øe Inconveniencies:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That according to the tenderne≈øs or ≈øtrength of the Skin or Bodies, ≈øometimes it eats in deeper than needs; for we have found by experience, that in ≈øome it hath eaten through the Skin and Mu≈øcles, to the very cavity of the Belly; in others irrecoverably wounded the proce≈ø≈øes of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum,</hi> together with the ≈øeminal ve≈ø≈øels therein.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Commonly it ≈øpreads it ≈øelf in length and breadth ≈øomewhat further than you would have it, e≈øpecially if it be to be applied under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, in the Groin, or in the Joynts; for it no ≈øoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grows warm, but it melts, and ≈øo ≈øpreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, notwith≈øtanding the Plai≈øter with which the Surgeon de≈øigned to bound it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There are nece≈ø≈øarily required ≈øome hours (in ≈øome Bodies more, in others le≈øs) before it can perform its Operation; and this the Humor will not always bear, e≈øpecially if it be malign.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And the Scar falls not pre≈øently off; and if you would give a pre≈øent vent to the Humors, you will be obliged ≈øtill to make u≈øe of a Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet. Be as circum≈øpect as you can, I am ≈øure, you will hardly avoid the≈øe Inconveniencies.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Launcet</hi> hath this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52336:32"/>
that many people are affrighted at it, and that it is painful: But the fear may be prevented by ≈øilence, and the pain is little con≈øiderable; mean time you have the≈øe Advantages:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That with the <hi>Launcet,</hi> the Apertion may be made as long and as deep as the Chirurgeon de≈øireth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The matter is ≈øuddenly di≈øcharged, and the Patient hath pre≈øent relief.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The unconcocted remainder may be the ≈øooner concocted, by a≈ø≈øi≈øting Nature with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Remedies, both inwardly and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. You will not be troubled with a long gleet, which if it happens, the fault is a≈ø≈øuredly in the Chirurgeon. For almo≈øt all Tumors that appear behind the Ears, in the Neck, under the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, or in the Groin, ≈øpring from indurated Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, replete with a preternatural humor; the≈øe Glandules are all included in their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, which being toucht, either with a Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, or with Corro≈øive Medicines, there mu≈øt needs follow a gleet (for 'tis impo≈ø≈øible that the Glandule ≈øhould be able to pre≈øerve it ≈øelf, or the contained Humor, its Tunicle being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) which will continue until the whole Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule and Tunicle are both con≈øumed.</p>

                     <p>This Manual Operation is ancient, and full of danger; yet ≈øometimes pre≈øerves the life of the Patient. Nature and Succe≈øs have emboldened us now and then to make u≈øe of it; but Experience hath taught us, that the greate≈øt difficulty con≈øi≈øts herein: 1. That the parts debilitated, and de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their natural heat, do ea≈øily, after open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mortifie. 2.

                     <p>Who therefore expects a good i≈ø≈øue of this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, mu≈øt u≈øe it only upon a Body that is not emaciated or wa≈øted; in a Drop≈øie that is recent (or at lea≈øt, when the Tumor in a ≈øhort time hath ri≈øen to a great bulk) and which, upon the u≈øe of proper Remedies, would not pre≈øently be removed; in ≈øuch Patients that are not mole≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Fever, or with difficulty of breathing, and where the noble parts are yet ≈øound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted; and in per≈øons of a middle age, ≈øince in Children and in old people it ≈øucceeds not ≈øo pro≈øperou≈øly.</p>

He that will be very careful of the opening, mu≈øt make it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Ductus</hi> of the <hi>Fibres,</hi> a little ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely downwards (according to this \) in the left ≈øide; and (according to this, /) in the right ≈øide.</p>
                     <p>As ≈øoon as you perceive Water to come forth, take a Golden, Silver, or Leaden ≈ømall Pipe, that is, 1. Smooth. 2. Furni≈øht at the Head with a Button or Wing. 3. Perforated on the ≈øides with three or four holes. 4. No longer than the thickne≈øs of the di≈ø≈øected part, that is, an inch broad. 5. Somewhat crooked at the end. 6. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fitting the ≈øize of the Orifice. Put this into the Apertion, lay over it a ≈øticking-Plai≈øter (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take a Spunge, or a four double linnen Rag) bind up the Patient, and let him re≈øt two or three hours; then open the Bandage again, and take away one, two, three, ≈øeldom or never more pints of Water, and ≈øo repeating it once or twice a day, till the water be <hi>almo≈øt</hi> all di≈øcharged. You mu≈øt not take away all at fir≈øt, for the chilne≈øs of

the parts, following ≈øo great an Evacuation, very often cau≈øeth death. The Pipe is not to be taken out, but mu≈øt remain all the time of the cure in the Wound, which you mu≈øt at length heal up according to Art.</p>
                     <p>For the opening of an Hydropical Belly, this is the ≈øafe≈øt as hitherto practi≈øed way, that is left us by the Ancients; but the indu≈øtry of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity hath invented for us a much convenienter In≈øtrument, whereby we not only do avoid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the above-mentioned difficulties, but al≈øo with le≈øs trouble pre≈øerve the lives otherwi≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Patients, freeing them from ≈øtretching, pain and trouble, according to our plea≈øure, or the degree of their ≈øtrength.</p>
                     <p>This never enough commended <hi>In≈øtrument</hi> was fir≈øt of all brought out of <hi>Italy</hi>; by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Chirurgeon of this City, Mr. <hi>Jacob Block,</hi> and by him put into practice, to the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of many Patients.</p>
                     <p>Commonly he chu≈øeth the place lately pointed out by us, <hi>viz.</hi> about three inches below the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and perforates the Skin, Mu≈øcles and <hi>Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum,</hi> unto the very Water, taking away no more at once than a quart.</p>
                     <p>That done, he draws out his In≈øtrument again, puts nothing upon the made hole but dry Lint and a ≈øticking-Plai≈øter, whereby he ≈øufficiently hinders the running out, again≈øt your Will, of even a drop of Water; for, upon the withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the In≈øtrument, the opened Skin, Mu≈øcles and <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> are ea≈øily by their natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øo far drawn a≈øunder, that the holes cannot any more exactly clo≈øe upon one another.</p>
                     <p>This being once performed, we regulate our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>≈øelves
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52336:35"/>
according to the ≈øtrength of the Patient, ≈øtaying two, three or more days, before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this Operation; then either the fir≈øt Orifice is to be opened, or again a new one to be made, e≈øpecially if the Chirurgeon finds, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be more conveniently drawn away in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place.</p>
                     <p>In an <hi>Hydrocele</hi> (when the water is fallen into the <hi>Scrotum</hi>) the ≈øaid Chirurgeon doth by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrument ≈øo dexterou≈øly di≈øcharge the Water out of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> that the next day you ≈øhall not, or hardly be able to find where the Hole was.</p>
                     <p>The Perforation ≈øeems to me a little inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, wherefore I have cau≈øed this In≈øtrument ≈øo far to be altered, as that I make the end not to be wrought round, but ≈øharp on both ≈øides, Launcet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, by which means it may be ≈øooner thru≈øt through the Mu≈øcles. But then, <hi>his</hi> may be made of Silver, <hi>mine</hi> mu≈øt be of Steel.</p>

                     <p>THere is ≈øometimes collected in the Cavity of the Brea≈øt a <hi>water</hi> or <hi>purulent matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Water</hi> gathers either by ≈øome <hi>Lymphatick Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> bur≈øt, or from an unconcocted watrine≈øs of the Blood. The <hi>purulent Matter</hi> follows upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the Throat, or Lungs, or a Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be Matter that is collected, it is called <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyema</hi>; if Water, <hi>Hydrops pectoris vel pulmonis,</hi> the Drop≈øie of the Brea≈øt or Lungs.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Marks</hi> of the <hi>Water</hi> are, a dry Cough, a painful heavine≈øs, a difficulty of breathing, even to Suffocation, great Thir≈øt, little Appetite, a pale Look and ≈øometimes a ≈øwelling of the Legs, now and then accompanied with a Feaver; and when the Patient turns him≈øelf, you may perceive a rumbling noi≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The collected <hi>Sanies</hi> may be known by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Signs</hi>; When the Inflamation of the Lungs or <hi>Pleura,</hi> will not, upon Bleeding, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient means, be ≈øufficiently removed, then may you apprehend a collection of ≈øuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to come within a fortnight. Between the thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and fortieth day the Tumor commonly breaks. The Patient ≈øhall find a great heavine≈øs in his Che≈øt without con≈øiderable pain; and in ca≈øe it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pain, then you are to Expect a new Flux, which you mu≈øt divert by Bleeding. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52336:37"/>
Patient hath a difficulty in breathing; in motion, he hears a rumbling, at lea≈øt he is ≈øen≈øible that the matter changeth place, and the ≈øide affected is to the touch, hotter than the other. He ca≈øts up, with violent coughing, a purulent matter, having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Fever; he finds an anxiety at his heart, and hath little ≈øtomach to his meat.</p>
                     <p>If we cannot expel the≈øe Humors by Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, nor by Diureticks, nor Diaphoreticks, nor by purging Medicines, then are we forc'd to come to Manual Operation.</p>
                     <p>This cannot be done without danger, and is not to be attempted in ca≈øe the Patient be weak, and the inward parts already corrupted. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, this Operation hath le≈øs danger than the next foregoing, and people oftner recover upon it; yea, Learned Writers a≈ø≈øure us, that by this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and the u≈øe of Injection, they have cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many of Ulcers of the Lungs.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>Place</hi> of Opening, Authors are not agreed in it; the rea≈øon whereof is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: For, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> runs higher in ≈øome per≈øons than in others; whence it comes to pa≈øs, that the collected Humors in ≈øome Patients, lie higher than in others. Secondly, the Che≈øt is rai≈øed in ≈øome, flat in others; which here much alters the ca≈øe. Be≈øides, the Lungs do often grow ≈øo fa≈øt to the <hi>Pleura,</hi> that the ≈øanious matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ea≈øily be carried into the Cavity of the Brea≈øt: In which ca≈øe it would be ill done, to cho≈øe the place of Opening lowe≈øt, in re≈øpect of the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.</hi> And in regard that in this, as in other ≈øwellings, the mo≈øt eminent place is, e≈øteemed the mo≈øt convenient for opening, it cannot be otherwi≈øe but that one Chirurgeon hath made
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52336:38"/>
choice of this place, and another u≈øeth that place as the be≈øt. Upon which account, <hi>Hyppocrates Guido, Amatus Lu≈øitanus,</hi> &amp;c. do make the aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the third and fourth Rib, counting from beneath upwards: <hi>Fienus, Riverius,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, between the fourth and fifth; <hi>Paulus Aegineta, Vidus Vidius, Fabritius ab Aquapendente, Sennertus,</hi> &amp;c. between the fifth and ≈øixth; which place, in my opinion, is the ≈øafe≈øt; for, if higher, the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> if lower, the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> may be wounded, of which there have been many ≈øad Examples. But in this difference of di≈ø≈øenting Writers, what hath been ≈øaid, will direct you to pa≈øs into the ≈øafe≈øt Haven.</p>
                     <p>All things therefore well con≈øidered, chu≈øe the place where to make your Apertion; not the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part (for, <hi>before,</hi> the <hi>Sternum</hi> or Brea≈øt-bone will hinder your operation here; nor in the back-part, for the Ribs are ≈øo clo≈øe to one another, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting ≈øome Ve≈ø≈øels, you cannot make any Apertion there) but on the ≈øide, four or five inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from the <hi>Sternum</hi>: Neither ought the Inci≈øion to be ≈øo near to the upper Ribs, as to the lower, becau≈øe the interco≈øtal Ve≈ø≈øels, <hi>viz.</hi> the Vein, Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Nerve, lie in the lower part of each Rib, where Nature hath a≈ø≈øigned them a place, branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them≈øelves into the middle of the interco≈øtal Mu≈øcles; which di≈ø≈øemination neverthele≈øs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that the Inci≈øion may be made in the middle between the two Ribs.</p>
                     <p>After you have marked the place with Ink, charge the Patient to breath forth as long as po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he can, without taking it in, and in the mean time make an oblique, but ≈ømall Orifice, and put into it a Silver or Leaden Pipe, and take forth four
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52336:38"/>
or five ounces of Matter to run out in a day. In ca≈øe the Matter does not come forth well, place your Patient on the wounded ≈øide, and make him to cough; if by rea≈øon of its toughne≈øs it will not yet come forth, then inject into the cavity ≈øome ab≈øter≈øive, ex≈øiccating and healing Medicines; As,</p>
                     <p>Take Goats whey, eighteen ounces; Honey of Ro≈øes, four ounces; the Juice of Celandine and Smallage, of each ≈øix drams: Mingle it.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of Comfrey the greater, an ounce; of Sanicle, half an ounce; the Leaves of Betony, Agrimony, Periwincle, Burnet, of each half a handful; the Cordial Flowers, two pugils; the Seed of St. John'swort, Holy-Thi≈øtle, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Nettle, of each half a dram: Boil them in Water and Honey to a pint and half; ≈øtrain it, and keep it for your u≈øe.</p>
                     <p>Of this Injection, the Patient may al≈øo drink a little twice or thrice a day.</p>
                     <p>It is yet further to be ob≈øerved, that the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Matter is often contained in a Membrane of its own, and by its ri≈øing, manife≈øts it ≈øelf from without; and then the <hi>Latines</hi> call it <hi>Vomica Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monis</hi>: In which ca≈øe, you mu≈øt not ≈øtay till the Membrane breaks of its ≈øelf; for by delay, the Matter flowing up and down is more difficulty to be got out of the Brea≈øt; but open it pre≈øently, taking no other place, but the mo≈øt rai≈øed part of the ≈øwelling.</p>
                     <p>Now, ≈øince an <hi>Empyema</hi> for the mo≈øt part fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon a <hi>Pleuri≈øie,</hi> and 'tis dayly found, that ignorant Chirurgeons take all kind of pain in the Sides, Belly and Brea≈øt, although cau≈øed from Winds only, for a Pleuri≈øie; thereupon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

opening a Vein; I thought therefore nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to write in this place of the <hi>Pleuri≈øie,</hi> as much as is nece≈ø≈øary for a Chirurgeon to know, for the preventing ≈øuch mi≈øtakes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Pleuri≈øie then is an inflammation of the</hi> Pleura, <hi>and commonly of the Lungs them≈øelves, cau≈øed from afflux of Blood, accompanied with Pain Cough, ≈øpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Blood, ≈øhortne≈øs of Breath, continual Feaver, ≈øtrong and quick Pul≈øe.</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Cau≈øe</hi> is the Blood, ≈øometimes alone (when a true Pleuri≈øie) ≈øometimes mixt with other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors then it occa≈øions a <hi>Ba≈øtard</hi> one.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Signs,</hi> as may be ≈øeen in the De≈øcription, are ≈øo evident, that tho≈øe who know not how to di≈øtingui≈øh it from a <hi>Cholick,</hi> are not worthy of any excu≈øe.</p>

If the Cough, and difficulty of breathing le≈ø≈øen not by a copious Expectoration, 'tis an ill ≈øign. If the Patient come not to ≈øpit the third or fourth day, then will he ≈øcarce ≈øee the ≈øeventh. If upon Bleeding, and other fit means, the pain cea≈øe not, the Patient mu≈øt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die, or the Pleuri≈øie will turn to a Con≈øump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an <hi>Empyema.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] In this ca≈øe, <hi>Bleeding</hi> is one of the mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary and ≈øafe≈øt means of Cure; and if u≈øed in time, the Patient, in the very Operation, and before the Vein be clo≈øed, will find relief, and ≈øometimes be altogether freed of the pain. Nor do I know any Di≈øea≈øe, in which there may, to the Patient's benefit, be ≈øo much Blood taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at once, as in this.</p>
                     <p>There are different Opinions concerning what
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52336:39"/>
≈øide the Patient is to bleed on: But tho≈øe have had little Experience of this ≈øickne≈øs, who have not found, that Patients (at lea≈øt in the≈øe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys) are relieved much more and ≈øooner, when they are bled in the Arm of the ≈øame ≈øide where the Pain is, than when it is done in the oppo≈øite ≈øide.</p>
                     <p>The Pain not cea≈øing in four and twenty hours, we are nece≈ø≈øitated to bleed twice or thrice, mo≈øt commonly in the ≈øame Arm; but here you mu≈øt well ob≈øerve the Patient's ≈øtrength.</p>
                     <p>After letting Blood, ≈øometimes Purging, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Expectorating Remedies, are very nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary. One only Medicine I cannot conceal from you, becau≈øe of its Excellency. The Indu≈øtrious Phy≈øitian Dr. <hi>Hadden</hi> in his <hi>Cure</hi> of the <hi>Pleuri≈øie,</hi> hath much commended it, and I have, after once Bleeding, always in the beginning u≈øed it with great ≈øucce≈øs, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Cataract</hi> (by the Greeks called <hi>Hypochyma</hi> by the Latines, <hi>Suffu≈øio</hi>; in the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Tongue, <hi>De Staer) is a concretion of ≈øuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humors, by little and little generating a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Membrane betwixt the</hi> Cornea <hi>and the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtalline Humor, covering either totally, or in part, the Pupil of the Eye, and ≈øo depriving the Patient, of his ≈øight, or hindring it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Difference.</hi>] It is either <hi>Imperfect,</hi> when the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is thin, or the Apple of the Eye not totally covered; or <hi>Perfect,</hi> when it is changed into a Membrane, or the Pupil is quite covered. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 'tis white, gray, yellow, green, ≈øometimes of a leaden colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according as the green, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or black Choler is mingled among≈øt it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Seat</hi> of it is between the <hi>Cornea</hi> and the <hi>Cry≈øtalline</hi> humor, being ≈øometimes nearer to <hi>this,</hi> ≈øometimes to <hi>that.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cau≈øe</hi> is a Phlegmatick Humor, either collected there by the weakne≈øs of the Eyes, or by the Brain tran≈ømitted thither by rea≈øon of its abundance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] In the beginning, the Patient ≈øees every thing double, and of many colours; the Air ≈øeems to him full of Flies, Nets and Clouds, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure a great light. Thereupon his ≈øight le≈ø≈øens, and all things appear as Spots, and at length there follows blindne≈øs. If it be ju≈øt in

the Center of the Pupil, yet covers not the whole Pupil; but leaveth round about the ≈øight ≈øome place free, and then all the Patient ≈øees, ≈øeems per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated. If the Pupil ≈øpreads it ≈øelf, when you rub the Eye with your Fingers, then is it yet imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; if it remains unmoved, there is no doubt of its being perfect.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Progno≈øticks.</hi>] The imperfect Cataract may ea≈øily be cured in the beginning, by convenient External and Internal Medicines, in ≈øound Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in Patients of a middle Age. The le≈øs the Pupil is dilated, the le≈øs hope of Cure. The nearer the Suffu≈øion is to the Cry≈øtalline Humor, the more dangerous. If the Eye be turned to the Sun, and the Patient then ≈øees no glimmering of Light, there is no benefit to be expected from the Manual Operation. If the Humors of the Eye be commixt by the Needle, though the Membrane be removed, then blindne≈øs will certainly remain. If in the Operation you happen to touch the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Eye, called the <hi>Retina,</hi> the Patient will after that always ≈øee the Air, as if full of ≈ømall Hair and Flies. A Cataract commonly remains ≈øo ≈øoft unto the third year, that it will not follow the Needle; after the third or fourth year, it is ≈øo firm and hard, that it can by no Art be loo≈øned. The Blood ≈øpilt by the u≈øe of the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, cau≈øeth no danger, and ≈øoon cea≈øeth of it ≈øelf. Though the Cataract be not altogether ≈øuppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, but divided into ≈øeveral pieces, the ≈øight doth often perfectly return within ≈øix or eight weeks, though before that time the whole Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ≈øhould ≈øeem to be fruitle≈øs; which I ≈øpeak from manifold Experience.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cure.</hi>] The <hi>Imperfect</hi> Cataract requires
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52336:43"/>
≈øolely the Aid of the Phy≈øitian, who by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines and ≈øtrengthening the Stomach and Head, have done much; to which purpo≈øe the con≈øerve of Marjoram, Ro≈øemary, Beteny, <hi>Pulv. Diambre,</hi> &amp;c. are very good. And outwardly u≈øe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing means.</p>
                     <p>Take Gum Tragacanth di≈ø≈øolved in Eyebright water, two drams; Burnt Allom, one ≈øcruple: Make a Collyrium.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Celandine water, an ounce and half; White wine, half an ounce; Spirit of Wine, two drams; White Vitriol, ≈øix grains; Prepared Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a ≈øcruple; Gla≈øs of Antimony, five grains; Sugar-Candy, two drams and an half; Camphire, ≈øix grains: Mix it, and make a <hi>Collyrium.</hi>

                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Juyce of Fennel, of Celandine, of each two ounces; Leaves of Rue and Marjoram, of each a Pugil; Eye-bright, one handful; of the Gall of an Oxe, four ounces; the Gall of Hens; an ounce; Red-Myrrhe, Aloes, of each a dram and half; Sarcocols, half an ounce; Camphire, two ≈øcruples: Mingle them, and let them be dilled in <hi>B.

                     </p>
                     <p>If the Cataract be confirmed, then let the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Operation be your only refuge; but beware of attempting the Operation, if the Patient have long before complained, and ≈øtill complains of Head ach or pain of his Eyes; if the Body hath not been clean≈øed in general, nor the Head in particular; and if the Patient be yet mole≈øted with a Fever, Sneezing, Coughing or Vomiting.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>THe Section which is u≈øed in the Hard and Bony Parts, is of four kinds,</hi> viz. <hi>Scraping, Filing, Sawing and Perforating, that is, Trepanning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scraping is u≈øed in a Fi≈ø≈øure and foul Bone,</hi> in the <hi>Teeth</hi> al≈øo, when they are cru≈øted over with a Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous black ≈øub≈øtance; the Bones are to be ≈øcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped till you come to the ≈øound part, which is white and ≈øolid, and a little blood ca≈øt forth; and to the Bone thus ≈øcraped, ≈øome drying Powder is to be applied; the <hi>Pericranium</hi> and <hi>Perio≈øtium</hi> mu≈øt fir≈øt be ≈øeperated from the Bone, before you go about this Operation; for by no means are they to be touched with the In≈øtrumenr, neither like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe the lips of the Wound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Filing</hi> is u≈øed in the Teeth; for when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally ≈øtand forth, and either in Eating or Speaking, are any hinderance to a man; then that which thus ≈øticks forth, is with a File to be taken off, which mu≈øt be done carefully, without any injury to the neighouring parts, and by degrees, neither with two great a Violence, le≈øt it loo≈øen the Tooth.</p>
                     <p>The u≈øe of the <hi>Saw</hi> is in a mortified part, when the Bone is to be cut a ≈øunder; concerning which Operation I ≈øhall ≈øuddenly ≈øpeak.</p>

                        <hi>Perforating</hi> or <hi>Trepanning</hi> is of great u≈øe, when the Bones are extreamly ≈øoul, but 'tis of greate≈øt u≈øe in tho≈øe effects, which the Fi≈ø≈øure or a Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

                        <p>When the Mother turns her ≈øelf from one ≈øide to the other, and perceives the Child to fall on the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52336:50"/>
≈øide laid upon, like a ≈øtone or a great weight; the Face, and chiefly the Lips grow pale, the extream parts cold, as likewi≈øe the lower Belly, the Paps begin to grow lank, the Breath becomes fetid, great pains of the Head, Faintings and Fevers, Water and ≈øtinking Gleet flows out of the Womb; If the After-Birth be excluded before the Child, 'tis impo≈ø≈øible the Child can live long; but the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt ≈øign of all is, if the Membrane of the Head of the Child be not ob≈øerved to be any longer ten≈øe; for as long as it is ten≈øe, the Infant lives.</p>

                        <p>But fir≈øt, it is diligently to be enquired into, which of the Cau≈øes it is that hinders the Birth: If the Child be greater and the pa≈ø≈øage ≈øtraighter than u≈øually, they ought to be dilated; this ≈øome Midwives do with convenient In≈øtruments, and ≈øo draw forth the Child alive; but where they are wanting, the Midwife mu≈øt clutch her hand very clo≈øe, and thru≈øt through the Internal Orifice into the Womb it ≈øelf; then putting her Fingers one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another through the Orifice into the inner part of the Womb, to di≈øcover the ≈øituation of the Child; and if ≈øhe finds the Arms or Feet to come inconveniently, let her gently rai≈øe it up, bringing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52336:50"/>
the Head downwards, which if ≈øhe finds to be next the Orifice, if po≈ø≈øible, let her put in her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand through the <hi>Pudenda</hi> into the Womb, and ≈øo with both her hands laying hold of it, draw it forth.</p>
                        <p>But if this Operation cannot be performed, then with a hook firmly fixt (le≈øt it injure the in≈øide of the Womb) in the Mouth, Eye or Ear of the Child, and ≈øo gently draw it forth; and if the <hi>Faetus</hi> will not follow, then with another Hook, blunt on the out-≈øide, and ≈øharp within, let him cut in pieces the Belly, Brea≈øt, or Head of the Child; and if the Arms or Legs cannot be brought forth, let him cut them off; ≈øo at length, being deprived of its Limbs, the remainder may be drawn forth.</p>
                        <p>But if by this way the Woman can neither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, with a ≈øharp and ≈øtrong Knife, the Limbs one after another are to be cut out, and ≈øo the Child be drawn forth by piece-meal: It is nece≈ø≈øary that this be perform'd by none but a good Anatomi≈øt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Secundine</hi> will pre≈øently follow the Birth, for it's of no u≈øe, that being excluded; for the Mouth of the Womb, ≈øuddenly after delivery, is ≈øo clo≈øly ≈øhut, that not without great pain it can admit the Hand of the Midwife; therefore the Midwife, as ≈øoon as may be, is to draw it forth, and with her fingers, if it ≈øticks very clo≈øe to the Womb, gently to ≈øeparate it, but not pluck it a way forcibly, which is mortal; and although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Writers and Midwives of inferior Rank, little regard the retention of the After-Birth for ≈øome time after delivery; yet I think I have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to pronounce it, one of the greate≈øt Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of Womens Labour.</p>

if it be where there is a double Bone, as in the Leg, and below the Elbow, the Fle≈øh and Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between them is to be divided; which being performed, let the Bone be ≈øeparated with a very ≈øharp Saw.

                        <p>If either the Patient or Chirurgeon be aver≈øe to the u≈øe of a Cautery, then as ≈øoon as the Member is taken off, let the Skin together with the Fle≈øh, in four di≈øtinct places oppo≈øite one to the other, be taken up with a Needle and waxed Thread, and the Ligature being loo≈øened above, or drawn down, that, if po≈ø≈øible, they may meet: So by this way is the <hi>Hemorage</hi> ≈øtaid, the Bone pre≈øerved from all danger, and the Wound ≈øooner cured.

                     <p>In this Definition, received by the be≈øt Phy≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chirurgeons, I note two things: 1. The <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of this Tumor, <hi>not to be impure Blood,</hi> ≈øeeing the be≈øt, may produce it; <hi>not ≈øimply abounding in quantity,</hi> becau≈øe it al≈øo happens in wa≈øted Bodies, though 'tis not ≈øo ≈øoon generated, nor arrives to ≈øuch a greatne≈øs in the≈øe, as in tho≈øe Bodies; but <hi>the true cau≈øe is the Ero≈øion, Rupture or Dilatation of the Membranes which clo≈øe the Mouths of the Capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Ve≈ø≈øels, that the nutritious Blood may not flow too ≈øuddenly into the Part</hi>; from whence, more Blood flows into the Part than what is required for its nouri≈øhment; and Nature changeth that Blood which otherwi≈øe would purifie into a fle≈øhy Sub≈øtance. 2. <hi>This fle≈øh ≈øometimes grows to the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the common Tunicles of the</hi> Scrotum, <hi>and not to the Te≈øticles,</hi> in which ca≈øe it may be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52336:52"/>
without either hurting, or cutting of them out.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> are, the hardne≈øs, and ≈ølow encrea≈øe of the Tumor, which is rather more trouble≈øome than painful, except accompanied with ≈øharp Humors; no appearance of any Tumor in the Groin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progno≈øticks.</hi>] A <hi>Sarcocele</hi> is hardly cured by the help of Medicines, and ≈øeldom by manual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, without taking off the Te≈øticle, if it extends it ≈øelf into the Groins, for the mo≈øt part incurable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] In the beginning, when the Membranes of the Ve≈ø≈øels being eroded, broke or dilated, do give leave for too much leave to i≈ø≈øue forth, <hi>Bleeding, and the u≈øe of Repelling and Re≈øtringent Medicines profit much</hi>; but when it hath begun to augment, then we may u≈øe the≈øe following means: Let there be made a little Orifice into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> rather in its Superior then Inferior Part, through which, by the help of Plegets let Suppurating Medicines be applied, ≈øo that if po≈ø≈øible, to wa≈øte the Fle≈øh, every dre≈ø≈øing diligently wiping away the Matter, but not at all, that the remaining Fle≈øh may be the better con≈øumed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If the≈øe things ≈øucceed not,</hi> draw forth the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticle, and by Inci≈øion take off as much Fle≈øh as may be done without injury to it; then re≈øtore it again into its place, and the remainder of the Fle≈øh endeavor to con≈øume by Suppuration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But if there be no hope of curing this Rupture by the recited means,</hi> draw forth the Hernious Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as far as you may, then pa≈øs once or twice a Silken Thred above the Tumor by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>; then pa≈øs both ends of the Silk through the Orifice it ≈øelf, ≈øo that which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52336:53"/>
was on the right ≈øide, may be on the left, and that of the left, on the right; and having ordered that the proce≈øs of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> may be tied with a knot, then cut off the Te≈øticle, letting both the ends of the Silk hang out of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and ≈øo cure it as another Wound.</p>
                     <p>I cannot here but friendly advi≈øe, 1. <hi>The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon ought to con≈øider well of the Cau≈øe, before he comes to the Operation it ≈øelf</hi>; for ≈øometimes the <hi>Para≈øtates</hi> are ≈øo ≈øwell'd, e≈øpecially the Te≈øticles being Scirrhous, that they may ea≈øily deceive a very curious Examiner. 2. The Ligature ought to be made as near to the Tumor as po≈ø≈øible, for by how much the higher part of the Proce≈øs of the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> be perforated, it is ob≈øerved to be ≈øo much the thicker, which thing will retard the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration and the falling of the Thread; in the mean time <hi>Convul≈øions</hi> coming on, denounce death. 3. The Spermatick Ve≈ø≈øels detain'd in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> oftentimes by Natures variety, exceed the Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles them≈øelves in greatne≈øs, which cau≈øes no other inconvenience but only Fear, which I have ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be true, in more than one.</p>

                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] The Urine is white, ≈ølimy, crude and troubled, ≈øuddenly adhering to the Urinal; ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is bloody, ≈øometimes ≈øandy or gravelly; ≈øometimes full of little Threads, and not ≈øeldom ≈øuppre≈øt; a great thir≈øt, a frequent making of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, but with pain and by drops: The Patients place them≈øelves with their Thighs acro≈øs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways holding their Privy-Parts in their hands, pre≈ø≈øing the bottom of their Belly; the Privy-Part is always erected, very painful to go or walk, in the Region of the Belly a weight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Patient ≈øeldom making Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going to Stool, the Inte≈øtine commonly falls out, e≈øpecially in young People.</p>
                     <p>Although all the≈øe Signs ≈øeem plain, yet they may ≈øometimes deceive a Phi≈øician; it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cu≈øtom with a <hi>Catheter</hi> pa≈ø≈øed through the <hi>Ureter</hi> into the Bladder, then thru≈øting in one or two fingers into the <hi>Anus,</hi> not only to ≈øearch for the Stone, but al≈øo under≈øtand its greatne≈øs. But this ≈øearching was ≈øo very painful, that it was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, through fear of pain, to have it permitted a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time; and this thing gave occa≈øion to have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the ≈øecond time of ≈øearching, all In≈øtruments nece≈ø≈øary for cutting out the Stone; but the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent and great Prince of Phy≈øicians hath now granted to tho≈øe mi≈øerable Patients, tho≈øe Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, who not only without <hi>Catheter,</hi> but al≈øo without pain, both in old People and Children, which can mo≈øt certainly find out the Stone; and for this Rea≈øon they Excel the ≈øo much E≈øteem'd <hi>French-men.</hi> I wi≈øh other places may may enjoy the ≈øame Arti≈øts.</p>

                        <hi>Progno≈øtick.</hi>] A crumbling Stone ≈øeldom, a hard Stone can never be wa≈øted by Medicines, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever boa≈øting per≈øons may ≈øay; ≈øometimes it is ≈øo ≈øoft, that by the very <hi>Catheter</hi> it ≈øelf it may be broke to pieces in the neck of the Bladder, and be brought forth; ≈øometimes through its ≈ømalne≈øs it comes forth whole; ≈øometimes it ≈øticks in the <hi>Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra,</hi> out of which, without danger and great pain it cannot be removed; if it ≈øticks in the <hi>Tunicles</hi> of the Bladder, or grows to the Superficies of the Interior Coat, it cannot be taken away by Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the death of the Patient: By how much the greater the Stone is, the Operation is the more dangerous and painful. Stones are often drawn forth out of Womens Bladders about the bigne≈øs of an Olive, or a Walnut, without Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion: but this way by Dilatation, of Extracting the Stone, is ≈øo dangerous, that it ought not to be performed but by experienced Chirurgeons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] Stones generated in the Kidneys, Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or other parts of the Body (for, they may in any) in general, require the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øician; but we in this place treat only of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of drawing them forth out of the Bladder by Inci≈øion. There are ≈øeveral ways by various Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors propo≈øed; but that which follows, is the mo≈øt common, and mo≈øt ≈øure.</p>
                     <p>Let the Chirurgeon place his Patient on a ≈øoft Pillow in a ≈øtrong mans Lap, after he has three or four times jumpt from a high place, then let him tie both his hands to the ≈øoles of his Feet, and let two ≈øtanders by hold each Knee, extending them as far as may be one from the other; then let him take the fir≈øt Finger of his left-Hand, or if nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity requires, the two fir≈øt, anointed with Oyl of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52336:56"/>
Lillies, Ro≈øes, or fre≈øh Almonds, and thru≈øt them up the Fundament, with his right hand gently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øing above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> ≈øo that the Stone may ≈ølip down under the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> into the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> which when brought thither by the fore≈øaid Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, let him make Inci≈øion with a ≈øharp Knife in the left ≈øide between the Te≈øticles and the <hi>Anus,</hi> near to the Suture of the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> cutting to the very Stone it ≈øelf; and if it comes not out of the Wound it ≈øelf, nor by the thru≈øting forth of the Fingers which are in the <hi>Inte≈øtinum rectum,</hi> let him draw it forth with a pair of Forceps, or which is better, with the <hi>Lapidillum</hi> or Spoon. The Stone being taken out, and all the Ligatures loo≈øed, let the Wound be bound up according to Art, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines, ≈øtopping Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> of Meal and Bole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the greate≈øt care to con≈øolidate it as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, le≈øt the Patient labour with a dropping of his Urine through the wounded part: And this is the manner of drawing forth the Stone, which Chirurgeons u≈øe to call <hi>Apparatus Minor,</hi> which chiefly is u≈øed in Children, although there are tho≈øe which proceed thus in People of full growth: But in our Country always this Inci≈øion is made by them who≈øe Fingers are fitted for this Operation,</p>
                     <p>But in People of full Age it is ≈øometimes very difficult to reach the Stone by the Fingers put up into the Fundament, and after the ≈øame manner to bring it down into the <hi>Perinoeum,</hi> if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impo≈ø≈øible, as many think it; therefore there is another way found out, which they call <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus Major</hi>; the Patient is put on a Table, and bound, and held as above, the Chirurgeon through the <hi>Uretra</hi> pa≈ø≈øeth a Director into the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52336:57"/>
Bladder to the Stone, then Inci≈øion being made as obove, in the hollow of the Director, puts in the Conductor, taking the Director out of the <hi>Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> he pa≈ø≈øeth into the Wound the Forceps, the <hi>Lapidillum,</hi> or other In≈øtrument convenient for drawing out the Stone, by which he may both lay hold of it, and draw it forth, not making u≈øe of his Fingers in the <hi>Anus,</hi> except great nece≈ø≈øity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to it. Where the Stone is bigger than the Orifice, and cannot come forth, the Wound is to be enlarged, or the Stone to be broken into pieces by the Forceps, and ≈øo drawn forth in parts: This done, the Binding and Con≈øolidating the Wound, ought to be the ≈øame as in Children, giving it a ≈øtitch if it be too great, putting in a Silver-Pipe for two or three days, that may give pa≈ø≈øage to the Concreted Blood, Slime and Sandy Urine.</p>
                     <p>The manner is the ≈øame in Women, but only the Fingers are not put into the <hi>Anus,</hi> but into the Privy-Parts, and the <hi>Catheter</hi> mu≈øt not be crooked, but ≈øtraight, and much ≈øhorter than the other.</p>
                     <p>There is likewi≈øe another manner of drawing forth the Stone; the Chirurgeon thru≈øting his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the <hi>Anus,</hi> pre≈ø≈øeth the Stone upwards to the Belly; then through the Wound made in the right Mu≈øcle above the <hi>Os Pubis,</hi> according to the <hi>ductus</hi> of its Fibres, by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillum</hi> or Forceps draw forth the Stone; by this way is never ob≈øerved any coming forth of the Urine, and the place ≈øuppo≈øed convenient to draw forth the Stone: But this Operation in it ≈øelf is dangerous and trouble≈øome, and if the Lips of the Wound made in the Bladder unite not to the Mu≈øcles of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> there follows an Ulcer of the Bladder, more painful, but le≈øs cureable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52336:57"/>
than the Stone it ≈øelf; which inconveniences have cau≈øed it not to be reckoned among other Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations by true Practi≈øers.</p>

                     <p>They are <hi>Terminated four ways</hi>; 1. By <hi>Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øipation,</hi> which the le≈ø≈øening of the Symptoms do declare. 2. By <hi>Suppuration,</hi> wherein the Pain

                     <p>The Cure is performed two ways: 1. <hi>By hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering any further Flux to the Part.</hi> 2. <hi>In removing that which is already gathered in the Part.</hi>

                        <hi>Progno≈øticks.</hi>] An Inflammation of the External Parts frees the Internal from many Di≈øea≈øes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways whole≈øome, except from its too great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention it produceth a Gangrene; dangerous and of hard cure is that which ≈øeizeth on the Eyes, Jaws, <hi>Penis, Pudendum Muliebre</hi> and Joynts.

                     <p>The <hi>Cure</hi> hath four <hi>Indications.</hi> The fir≈øt of the≈øe re≈øpects a good Diet; let him chu≈øe a clear Air, his Meat and Drink little, and that cooling; all hot, ≈øweet and fat things, as Pepper and Ginger, are hurtful; as al≈øo the motion of the Body, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Part affected; Sleep is very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: All Co≈øtivenefs, Anger and Venery are noxious,</p>
                     <p>Second, that ≈øtops the further Flux of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which may be performed by Revul≈øion, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation, Repelling and Interception; therefore let a Vein be opened as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, it being mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary: Revul≈øion is made in the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite and mo≈øt Remote part, Derivation in the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt: If you may not open a Vein, you mu≈øt u≈øe Leeches and Scarifications. Whil≈øt the≈øe things are done, ≈øeeing the Body is ≈øeldom clean, but that always there are ill Humors mixt with the Blood, by Purging rightly u≈øed, and often repeated, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo Bleeding, we effect much.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the Part affected requires Repelling Medicines, from which we mu≈øt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtain, Where, 1. The Noble Parts ≈øend the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors

                        <hi>Difference.] 'Tis perfect,</hi> when ≈øprung from Choler alone; as it is imperfect, when Blood, Phlegm or Melancholy is mixt with it; from who≈øe Appellation it likewi≈øe takes its name, and is called <hi>Ery≈øipelas, Phlegmonodes, Oedematodes, Scirrhodes</hi>; ≈øometimes an Ulcer is joined with it, which ≈øometimes con≈øumes only the Skin, other times the Fle≈øh it ≈øelf.</p>

                     <p>If cau≈øed from an <hi>External Heat,</hi> or ≈øtopping of the Pores, the Redne≈øs is changed into White, then into Black; Pul≈øation and Pain cea≈øe; the Sen≈øes le≈ø≈øened; and at la≈øt there appear ≈øome <hi>Pu≈øtules,</hi> from whence i≈ø≈øue a gleety Humor.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>from defect of Aliment,</hi> there is neither <hi>Pain, Inflammation</hi> or <hi>Tumor</hi>; the Body waxeth cold, and for the mo≈øt part ≈øeizeth upon the Joynts.</p>

                     <p>ANeuri≈øma <hi>is a Tumor be≈øides Nature, from a Rupture of an Artery, continually beating, ea≈øily yielding to the Fingers, and as ≈øuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cau≈øe.</hi>] All Arteries, except tho≈øe that are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øed, through the Brain and upper parts, con≈øi≈øt of a double Tunicle; the inmo≈øt of which being either corroded or broke, the External may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ≈øo much (without a Rupture of it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever others ≈øay) as to cau≈øe an <hi>Aneuri≈øm:</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs, where the Tumor is of the bigne≈øs of ones Fi≈øt, it cannot be but that the External al≈øo mu≈øt be either corroded or broke. Anatomy doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Opinion, which the Studious in the Art of Chirurgery may enquire into.</p>
                     <p>This Tumor al≈øo may be cau≈øed, where an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery be divided; ≈øo that the External Tunicle u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Mu≈øcles, the Internal, by rea≈øon of the continual pul≈øation, remains open.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs.</hi>] A Swelling increa≈øing by degrees, of the ≈øame colour as the skin; a continual Pul≈øation: If the Tumor be little, it ea≈øily yields to the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ≈øo that it altogether di≈øappears, but ≈øudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returns again; but if great, not ≈øo ea≈øily yielding to the touch, not ≈øo ≈øtrong a Pul≈øation: but there is a noi≈øe ob≈øerved, as of boiling Water; yet in the Head and Jaw, I have found after death an <hi>Aneuri≈øm,</hi> which while the man was alive,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52336:82"/>
there could be no Pul≈øe perceived: In the hard parts is greater Circum≈øpection to be u≈øed, than in the ≈øoft and fle≈øhy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progno≈øticks.</hi>] It is difficultly cured; if great, not at all, except with the taking off the Member; for the mo≈øt part it is a long Di≈øea≈øe, although I have ≈øeen it kill, without any other accidental Cau≈øe, within two years: If Inci≈øion be made, Death ≈øuddenly follows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] In the beginning there may be ≈øome Hopes. <hi>A≈øtringents</hi> and <hi>Repellents,</hi> and convenient Ligatures, by which we do not ≈øeldom admini≈øter ≈øomething of Remedy to the Patient; as al≈øo the applying <hi>a piece of Lead</hi> ≈øtraightly bound on, have ≈øometimes cured little <hi>Aneuri≈øms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But where the Tumor is encrea≈øed, there are ≈øome would have the Skin divided, and the Artery tied both above and below, and cut out the middle with the Tumor, and loo≈øen not the Ligatures, till the Wound is perfectly cured, and there is no fear of an Hemorrage; but this Operation is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, painful and trouble≈øome, and oft-times of little Benefit: But to pre≈øerve Life, I would take off the Member.</p>

                     <p>OPthalmia <hi>is an Inflammation of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Eye from Blood, with Redne≈øs, Pain, and ≈øhedding of Tears.</hi>

                        <hi>Difference.</hi>] A light Inflammation, and which depends from external Cau≈øes, is called a Ba≈øtard-<hi>Opthalmia, Taraxis,</hi> or <hi>Epiphora</hi>; but a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, accompanied with pain and tears, a true <hi>Opthalmia.</hi> And if it be ≈øo great, that the Eye-lids are ≈øo inflamed, and as it were turned inward, 'tis called <hi>Chemo≈øis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cau≈øes</hi> are two. 1. Internal, as Blood, oft-times mixt with <hi>Serum</hi> or Choler; ≈øeldom with Phlegm or Melancholy. 2. External, as Smoak, Du≈øt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> vary according to the variety of Cau≈øes: If it proceed from too great a quantity of <hi>Blood,</hi> the Face looks red, and the Ve≈ø≈øels of the Eyes are extended: If either from more of <hi>Serum</hi> or Choler, the Redne≈øs of the Face is le≈øs, but the Tears are more ≈øharp, and the pain greater; if from more of <hi>Phlegm,</hi> the reddi≈øh pain, Heat and Acrimony of Tears are more remi≈øs; and the Eye-lids at night are as it were glewed together: If from any thing of <hi>Melancholy,</hi> there are but few Tears, and the Eye-lids are not clo≈øed together, the Inflammation is not great, but ≈øtubborn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progno≈øticks.</hi>] An <hi>Opthalmia</hi> is flower cured in Children, than in old people. Continual pain menaceth Blindne≈øs, by how much greater the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation is, ≈øo much the more dangerous it is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] The Diet mu≈øt be the ≈øame as in a <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>; all ≈øharp things are carefully to be avoided; as Garlick, Radi≈øhes, Mu≈øtard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> little or no Suppers profit: <hi>Purging,</hi> the u≈øe of Gli≈øters, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be oft-times re-iterated; as al≈øo <hi>Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-Gla≈ø≈øes, Leeches, Bli≈øters</hi>; ≈øometimes al≈øo <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, I≈ø≈øues,</hi> and <hi>Artereotomy</hi> it ≈øelf, which is not to be done by any but an expert Chirurgeon;

                        <hi>Sneezing</hi> is hurtful; <hi>Provoking of Sweat</hi> is ≈øometimes nece≈ø≈øary, ≈øometimes not; which the Phy≈øician mu≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh: <hi>Dieureticks</hi> are of great u≈øe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they are not too hot.</p>

                        <hi>External</hi> Remedies vary according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cau≈øes; if from <hi>Smoke</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> let them be extingui≈øhed.</p>
                     <p>If from <hi>Du≈øt,</hi> or <hi>any thing got into the Eyes,</hi> 'tis to be taken forth, which is often performed by blowing, or by the ≈øpurting in of Ro≈øe-water.</p>

                        <hi>Differences</hi> are taken, 1. From the <hi>Form</hi>; ≈øome are long, others oblique; ≈øome are little, others great, ≈øome are deep, others ≈øuperficial. 2. From the <hi>wounded Part,</hi> as, the Head, Lungs, Heart, Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Guts, Nerve, Tendon, Vein or Mu≈øcle; ≈øometimes the Skin is only penetrated, then 'tis a ≈øimple Wound; ≈øometimes a Part of the Fle≈øh is taken away,

and then 'tis call'd a compound or hollow Wound. 3. From the Cau≈øes, which ≈øhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently be ≈øet down; ≈øometimes a wound happens to be poi≈øoned, and to have many Symptoms joined with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cau≈øes</hi> are five-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. All things that <hi>cut,</hi> as a Knife, Sword, Gla≈øs, 2. Al things that <hi>prick</hi>; as Needles, Arrows, Teeth. 3.

                     <p>
                        <hi>A mortal Wound is that, which in the ≈øpace of few hours or days, of nece≈ø≈øity cau≈øes Death, and cannot by any Art be cured.</hi>

≈øuddenly to the Patient; but that he not only lives many weeks, but oftentimes many years after.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Among the Wounds that are Mortal, are to be accounted the Wounds of the Brain, but not all of them; for Experience hath taught us, that part of the Brain hath been taken forth, and the Life pre≈øerved, though the Under≈øtanding lo≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Therefore tho≈øe Wounds of the Brain that be ab≈øolutely mortal, are, 1. <hi>When be≈øides the Brains, a Nerve is al≈øo wounded.</hi> 2. <hi>When Blood, or ≈øome other Humor ob≈øtructs the beginning of the Nerves:</hi> 3. <hi>When after a few days the concrete and putrified Blood produceth a Fever,</hi> Delirium, <hi>and Death it ≈øelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By concreted Blood, I under≈øtand not that which lies between the <hi>Dura-Mater</hi> and the Skull; for that is to be taken forth by the Trepan, and the Patient this way may be pre≈øerved; but that which is included between the <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or between the <hi>Pia</hi> and the Brain: Although ≈øometimes, that which is detained between both Membranes, by the dividing of the <hi>Dura,</hi> may be taken forth, and ≈øo the Patient pre≈øerved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Wounds of the Spinal Marrow are al≈øo mortal, which happens in the Neck, or nearer to the Head; but tho≈øe which happen lower, as about the <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> are of le≈ø≈øer danger.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Wounds of the Lungs are mortal, if great and deep, where the great Ve≈ø≈øels, or the Branches of the <hi>A≈øpera Arteria</hi> are hurt: Where the Ve≈ø≈øels are divided, there follows a great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion of Blood; where the Branches of the <hi>A≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Arteria,</hi> the Breath comes forth more through the Wound than the Mouth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Wounds of the heart are always mortal;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52336:89"/>
for though one or two wounded in the heart, have lived, two, three, or four days, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found yet, that ever any e≈øcaped.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Wound of the Wind-pipe may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if the Membranes only behind, to which the Cartilaginous Rings are join'd, be hurt; but if the Rings them≈øelves are wounded, there's no cure to be expected; yet ≈øometimes tho≈øe wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lingering Death; ≈øo that I have ≈øeen on ≈øo wounded, live Eighteen weeks before he died.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Wounds of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> tho≈øe that are inflicted in the fle≈øhy Part of it, are curable; but tho≈øe that are in the Nervous Part, though the≈øe always occa≈øion not ≈øudden Death, yet 'tis impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible ever to cure them.</p>

                     <p n="9">9. Wounds of the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> are mortal, where the Ve≈ø≈øels them≈øelves are wounded; where not, they may be cured.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Wounds of the <hi>Kidneys</hi> are not mortal; if the Wound penetrate into the Cavity it ≈øelf, for the mo≈øt part an Ulcer follows, which con≈øumes the whole Kidney, yet the Patient may continue many years: If the <hi>Parachyma,</hi> only be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ≈øometimes, through difficulty, it may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                     <p n="13">13. Wounds of the <hi>great Nerves</hi> are for the mo≈øt part incurable, and ≈øometimes mortal.</p>

                     <p>A Wound from a pricking In≈øtrument, is of le≈øs danger, than from a brui≈øing.</p>
                     <p>A Nerve, Vein or Artery, if wholly divided, are le≈øs dangerous, than if they were but in part.</p>
                     <p>A great Inflamation coming upon a great Wound, is of no great danger, except it continue too long; but a great Inflamation falling upon a little Wound, is an ill ≈øign.</p>

                     <p>'Tis to be <hi>di≈øtingui≈øhed</hi> here, where the Nerve or Tendon be divided, or only prick'd.</p>
                     <p>This Wound is known, 1. By con≈øidering <hi>the wounded place,</hi> and by Anatomy, which teacheth in what Members the Nerves are in≈øerted; but the Tendons ≈øeeing they terminate near the Joynts, the Hands and Feet having many; if a Wound ≈øhould be inflicted in the≈øe parts, who would not fear them to be ≈øo hurt, e≈øpecially if it be with a tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe

From <hi>the great Pain,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes Pul≈øation, Inflamation, Convul≈øion and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> &amp;c. except the Nerves be wholly tran≈øver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øly divided, and then the Symptoms are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not ≈øo grievous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progno≈øticks.</hi>] All the wounds of the Nerves are dangerous; a Puncture more dangerous than an Inci≈øion: Wounds of Tendons are le≈øs dangerous than Nerves. Convul≈øion is an ill ≈øign; Nerves and Tendons wounded, do ea≈øily putrifie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi>] In all Wounds of Nerves or Tendons, ≈øeeing <hi>pain</hi> greatly mole≈øts, occa≈øioning many Symptoms, care is to be taken that it be <hi>allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible. Outward cold things do here hugely injure, not only the Air, but Medicines them≈øelves: For Experience hath taught us, that cold, moi≈øt and a≈øtringent Medicines do nought but hurt; therefore 'tis be≈øt to u≈øe Medicines mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately hot and drying, but void of any ≈øharpne≈øs. The <hi>Wound</hi> al≈øo is to be kept <hi>open,</hi> till the Cure be ab≈øolutely performed, that the Matter may flow freely forth; which if kept in, may increa≈øe the pain, and cau≈øe the putrefaction of the Nerve; which, if it ≈øhould happen, the corrupt Part is to be cut off, or removed by an actual Cautery.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is to be ob≈øerved, whether the Nerve or Tendon lies bare or not; if bare, warm Medicines are convenient; but if <hi>covered,</hi> hotter Medicines are required; in the mean time, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and Bleeding are not to be neglected.</p>

Ulcers in Parts that are ≈øubject to much Humidity, are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly cured. If an Ulcer cannot be cured in a long time, or when Cicatriz'd, breaks out again, the Cau≈øe is, the Bone being foul under it. Ulcers near to the Nerves, Veins or Tendons are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. In Cacochimick Bodies, their Cure is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. If the Matter which comes from them be good, it gives hope of an ea≈øie Cure. Good Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of a middle con≈øi≈øtence between thin and thick, white, light, equal, and not at all ≈øtinking. That which is ill, is thin and fluid, pale, livid, and of ill ≈ømell.

                  <p>AS <hi>Chirurgery</hi> is a of <hi>Phy≈øick,</hi> that ought not to be ≈øeparated from it; ≈øo al≈øo let not any imagine to him≈øelf, that he can de≈øerve the name of an Experienced <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> except he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand ≈øome part of it, e≈øpecially <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> the only Foundation of <hi>Chirurgery.</hi> But ≈øeeing that the ≈øtudy of ≈øome mo≈øt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Anatomi≈øts,</hi> hath found out many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things in this happy Age, altogether unknown to the <hi>Ancients</hi> (though ≈øome foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhly affirm the contrary, with great pains, a≈øcribing tho≈øe things to them, which they never ≈øo much as dream'd of) which indeed are not to be accounted of, as ingenious ≈øubtleties; but as the Fundamental Rules

and Cyno≈øure to tho≈øe that Navigate through the va≈øt Ocean of this Art. It is every ones part to labour in it, that it may be perfected, and every day more and more illu≈øtrated; which may at length be brought to pa≈øs, if with the greater Pains, <hi>Indu≈øtry</hi> and <hi>Curio≈øity,</hi> we enquire into the unknown <hi>Regions</hi> and <hi>Tracts</hi> of the <hi>Microco≈øm,</hi> and not given to ≈øloth, plough our Ground with other Mens Oxen, only tru≈øting on the Authority of the Ancients, which the Learned wi≈øely call <hi>A≈øinorum Pontem.</hi> As for me, I have ventured to introduce ≈øome new <hi>Opinions;</hi> becau≈øe that I deemed them in the nature of things, to exceed thee and me, and all in Antiquity. If thou enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt into it with the ≈øame labour, perchance thou maye≈øt embrace the ≈øame <hi>Opinions</hi>: That of the <hi>Circulation of the Blood</hi> is now ≈øpread over all <hi>Europe;</hi> yea, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Profe≈ø≈øors</hi> in the Illu≈øtrious <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øities,</hi> do all with one voice approve it; the <hi>Salivous pa≈ø≈øages</hi> and <hi>Limphaducts,</hi> as al≈øo the <hi>Lacteal</hi> Ve≈ø≈øels, both the greater and le≈ø≈øer, may ≈øo plainly be demon≈øtrated, that they may be perceived as it were with one Eye. My own proper and peculiar <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions</hi> I have confirmed with Rea≈øons, which I ≈øuppo≈øe are agreeable to our Art: In the re≈øt, if thou finde≈øt any thing new,
<pb facs="tcp:52336:114"/>
it is nothing but what can be demon≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Di≈ø≈øection.

                  <p>For, fir≈øt I thought it convenient largely to di≈øcour≈øe of the ≈øimple Parts, their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe, that thou mighte≈øt not be nece≈ø≈øitated to repeat in following the ≈øame thing a hundred times.</p>
                  <p>To this end I have retained the Terms of our Art, u≈øed by the Ancient Latine Writers.</p>
                  <p>Then I expound the elaborating the <hi>Blood,</hi> which properly is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all <hi>Phy≈øick,</hi> and which the Wits of the Learned have long and much wre≈øted: <hi>O foelici≈ø≈øimum qui metam proxim√® atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Part (properly</hi> ≈øo call'd) <hi>is a firm, limited Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is nouri≈øhed by other living Parts but doth not nouri≈øh; having a peculiar u≈øe and operation for the advantage of the whole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is <hi>di≈øtingui≈øhed,</hi> 1. Into the <hi>Principal Parts,</hi> or or tho≈øe <hi>not ≈øo: Principal</hi> are tho≈øe that perform ≈øome Noble Operation common to the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as the Heart, Liver, Brain, Te≈øticles: <hi>Tho≈øe not ≈øo,</hi> are tho≈øe that ≈øerve the Principal, and whence they are call'd their Servants, as the Eye, Ear, Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This di≈øtinction plea≈øed ≈øome Anatomi≈øts many years ≈øince, whom I much e≈øteem; yet not me: For if the Liver and Heart are numbred among≈øt the Principal Parts becau≈øe they elaborate the Blood for the advantage of the whole Body, why is not the Tongue accounted a Principal Part al≈øo? which is not only an In≈øtrument of Speech, by which we are di≈øtingui≈øhed from Bea≈øts, but al≈øo of Ta≈øtes, by who≈øe a≈ø≈øi≈øtance we chu≈øe tho≈øe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments which are be≈øt; which if wanting, how the Heart and Liver could ≈øupply the Body with good Nutriment, I ≈øee not. The Brain governs all, but how I be≈øeech you? If the Inte≈øtines did not perform their Orifice aright, what would it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? How ≈øhould we be e≈øteem'd, if, like an Oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, we ≈øhould want Eyes and Ears? How de≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed are the Feet and Hands, yet in how many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

do they ≈øerve? For tho≈øe not ≈øtirring, both Chilification would be impaired, and the Blood and the Spirits rendred thicker, and the Brain made unfit for all actions: In how ≈øhort a time would the <hi>Limpha</hi> of our Body be corrupted, if, be≈øides its own motion, it was not al≈øo moved with the whole Body? All things in our Body are joyned together as in a Clock, one cannot be without the other; neither is the mo≈øt de≈øpicable Wheel le≈øs nece≈ø≈øary than the Hand of the Clock it≈øelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, it cannot be accounted a Clock.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Di≈ø≈øimilar</hi> are made up of more or le≈øs <hi>≈øimilars,</hi> as the Hand, Fingers, Feet.</p>
                     <p>There are <hi>ten Similars</hi> found in the Body; a Bone, Cartilage, Ligament, Membrane, Fibre, Nerve, Vein, Artery, Fle≈øh, Skin; the eight for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are made of Seed; Fle≈øh, of Blood alone, the Skin of both.</p>
                     <p>This Divi≈øion is ≈øubject to greater difficulties than the former; but ≈øeeing it is not convenient to reject it, without the greate≈øt confu≈øion in the practice of Phy≈øick, let us con≈øider the thing it ≈øelf, committing the Di≈øputes concerning the Name, to the Schools.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>A Principal Part being affected</hi> or <hi>wounded,</hi> renders the whole Cure dangerous: therefore <hi>Progno≈øticks</hi> are not to be given here, but with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, le≈øt the ≈øudden alteration be rather a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to thee, than to the Di≈øea≈øe.</p>

                        <p>The Bones are ≈øubject to many Di≈øea≈øes. <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> and <hi>Di≈ølocations</hi> are already di≈øcour≈øed of, as al≈øo <hi>Putrefaction</hi>: But ≈øeeing there may be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways produced, we will declare tho≈øe which are chiefly worth our con≈øideration.</p>
                        <p>Preternatural Humors, by what cau≈øe ≈øoever, either General or Particular, penetrating the Bone, ≈øometimes produce an <hi>Ulcerous Excre≈øcency with moi≈øtne≈øs of the Bone</hi>; ≈øometimes a <hi>Cancer of the Bone,</hi> to wit, <hi>Spina Vento≈øa,</hi> effects nece≈ø≈øary to be di≈øtingui≈øhed; which becau≈øe no Phy≈øician hath made it his bu≈øine≈øs to de≈øcribe, I will impart that which Rea≈øon and Experience hath taught us.</p>
                        <p>The cau≈øe of an <hi>Ulcerous Excre≈øcency with the Humidity of the Bone</hi> (which effect is called by the <hi>Dutch, een Been≈øuyger</hi>) is preternatural Phlegm, depriving the Bone of its temper and hardne≈øs; the fle≈øh cannot be ≈øaid from this ≈øoft foundation to keep al≈øo its Natural ≈øtate; but its nouri≈øhment pa≈ø≈øeth into ≈øoft ≈øpongy fle≈øh, which by degrees encrea≈øeth, and at length cau≈øeth an Ulcer; from
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52336:121"/>
whence the Tendons Ligaments, and Nerves are corrupted, and the whole Member ≈øubject to danger.</p>
                        <p>In this ca≈øe you mu≈øt not flatter your ≈øelf, that Medicines can effect any thing before you come to the bottom, that is, the Bone it ≈øelf: And the Bone being made ≈øound, the Ulcer will be cured, and the fle≈øh return unto its natural Con≈øtitution. It is therefore nece≈ø≈øary to make Inci≈øion, even down to the Bone it ≈øelf, and if there be a great excre≈øcency, <hi>extirpate it</hi>; and if it be ob≈øerved to ri≈øe again, apply an <hi>actual Cautery,</hi> always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration being had of the Bone.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Remedies proper</hi> again≈øt Putrefaction of the Bones, are already, both by us and others, ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently de≈øcribed.

                        <p>Take the Re≈øtaurative Powder, an ounce; white Vitriol, a dram; prepared Ar≈øenick, two drams: Mix them.</p>
                        <p>Sprinkle it upon the proud Fle≈øh, laying over it a drying Plai≈øter, and it will make a thick E≈øcar, without great pain, which may be taken off the next day.</p>

The <hi>Cau≈øe</hi> of a <hi>Cancer</hi> of the <hi>Bone</hi> (by the <hi>Dutch</hi> named <hi>een Beenvreeter</hi>) is a ≈øharp Humor, fir≈øt corroding the Bone, then making its way through the <hi>Perio≈øtium</hi>; then follows an Ulcer of the Fle≈øh and Skin, incurable, before the Bone be made ≈øound; its Orifice is very little, the edges are pale, the Matter that flows forth, is thin, the Fle≈øh ≈øoft, and ≈øomewhat ≈øwell'd, at lea≈øt (as we have

                        <p>Here al≈øo is Inci≈øion nece≈ø≈øary, made according to the length of the Part, to the Bone it ≈øelf; forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with mu≈øt be applyed tho≈øe things that <hi>correct Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction,</hi> to wit, <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> Spirit of Vitriol, mixt with Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp;e.</hi>

                        <p>I have not only once experienc'd the Powder of Turpentine, hardned by boiling, to be of great virtue, mixt with <hi>Ung.

                     <p>Of the la≈øt of which, a more convenient occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion will be offered to treat of in the following.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venae Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta</hi> take their beginning from the Liver. There are tho≈øe which would
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:52336:126"/>
have them come from the heart, from a weak Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from unborn Embrio's. But where I find many Branches in≈øerted in the Liver, few or none in the Heart; yea, I have ob≈øerved, that it hath not entred into the Heart it ≈øelf, but only to be joined to its right Auricle: I rather embrace the old Opinion, willingly granting tho≈øe honours to the Liver that I think belongs to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Roots of the Vena Cava and Porta were united by mutual Ino≈øculations,</hi> the old Anatomi≈øts per≈øwaded them≈øelves; but the curious Inqui≈øition of the Moderns hath both found out and clearly demon≈øtrated, that they mutually touch one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not ≈øo united, that the Blood can pa≈øs out of one into the other; for the extremities of the fore≈øaid Ve≈ø≈øels, by means of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Liver, do ≈øo mutually con≈øent, that Milk or any liquid thing ca≈øt into the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> with a Syringe, finds an ea≈øie pa≈ø≈øage into the <hi>Vena Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> without either an injury of the Veins or the Parenchyma. Concerning which, read <hi>Gli≈ø≈øon. Anatom.</hi> of the Liver, <hi>pag.</hi> 272.</p>
                     <p>Veins have only one <hi>Tunicle</hi> with many <hi>Valves</hi> within, e≈øpecially in the external Joints.</p>
                     <p>They are <hi>nouri≈øhed</hi> with Blood from the <hi>little Arteries,</hi> not that contained within them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>They are endowed with <hi>feeling,</hi> both from them≈øelves, and ≈øometimes from the Nerves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>U≈øe</hi> is, to receive the Blood not ≈øufficiently ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated from the Arteries, and return it to the Heart and Liver, there to be more perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted.</p>
                     <p>For the better Methods ≈øake in the following, we mu≈øt be forced to de≈øcribe all Veins here par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and divide them into their Branches.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. An <hi>Atrophy</hi> of the whole Body oftentimes comes from an Internal Cau≈øe: But if of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:52336:134"/>
Hand, Arm, Foot, for the mo≈øt part from an External Cau≈øe.

                        <p>Take fre≈øh tops of Savin, Juniper, Lovage, of each two handfuls; Camomile Flowers, Juniper-berries, of each two handfuls; Oyl of Bayes, White-Lillies, of each twelve ounces; Hogs-grea≈øe, three ounces; Dogs-grea≈øe, an ounce and half; <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> two ounces; Boil them to the con≈øumption of the moi≈øture; then add to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs'd Liquor, Oyl of Spike, three drams; Juniper, a dram; Mu≈øtard-≈øeed in Powder, half a an ounce; Roots of Pellitory of <hi>Spain,</hi> Long-Pepper powdred, of each two draws; Yellow wax as much as is ≈øufficient to make it into an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. The true rea≈øon of the generation of Wens, in my opinion, is this; the mouths of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries appointed to carry nouri≈øhment to the Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ≈øometimes are more opened than they ought to be, whether it be by Fall or Blow, or from an internal Cau≈øe, e≈øpecially in Plethorick People, and in Parts di≈øorderly moved, the native heat converts the extrava≈øated Blood into Fle≈øh: But ≈øeeing the Member requires not ≈øo great a quantity of nouri≈øhment, it increa≈øeth into a preternatural Swelling; and if this Blood be impure, Choler produceth Pain, Phlegm, Vi≈øcou≈øne≈øs, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a Cartilaginous hardne≈øs; and 'tis to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the≈øe Humors, that this preternatural fle≈øh is more yellow, white or livid.</p>
                        <p>'Tis ≈øeldom included in a proper Tunicle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept where Phlegm is its greate≈øt Cau≈øe, and then tho≈øe Tumors are generally in the Neck: The Veins grow big, according to the increa≈øe of the Tumor, ≈øo that under the Skin they appear as thick as ones Thumb.</p>
                        <p>'Tis not in it ≈øelf malignant, yet by ill applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be ea≈øily made ≈øo: Air is very hurtful, if the Tumor be expo≈øed to it.</p>

                        <p>In the beginning, the <hi>Medicines</hi> that are to be applied, ought to be very <hi>a≈øtringent</hi> and <hi>repelling,</hi>
                           <pb n="241" facs="tcp:52336:135"/>
the Part is gently to be rouled, having applied to it, either a Plate of Lead, or a Diachalcitheos Plai≈øter, or of Frogs with Mercury, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                        <p>Take Pomegranate-rinds, Bi≈øtort-roots, of each one dram; Scales of Iron, Quick-≈øilver, Burnt-Lead, of each two drams; Bole-armenick, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis Haematitis,</hi> of each a dram and half; Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Wax, as much as is ≈øufficient to make it into a Plai≈øter according to Art.</p>
                        <p>In the mean time, <hi>Purging, Bleeding, Scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>Application</hi> of <hi>Leeches</hi> are not to be neglected. <hi>Sweating,</hi> al≈øo <hi>Watchings</hi> and <hi>Ab≈øtinence,</hi> profit very much.</p>
                        <p>But if the Tumor yields not to the≈øe Remedies, but daily increa≈øeth, <hi>Suppuratives</hi> are to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if the≈øe within few days effect nothing, and the Tumor continuing in the ≈øame ≈øtate, an <hi>actual Cautery</hi> may be u≈øed; which, let not the contrary Opinions either of Chirurgeons or ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by hinder; for by its u≈øe, the increa≈øe of the Tumor will be ≈øtayed for a long time; yea, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Di≈øea≈øe will be wholly eradicated.</p>
                        <p>But if the Fle≈øh begins to repullulate again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expectation, the Surgeon ought not to defer to endeavour either by a <hi>Thred</hi> or <hi>Knife</hi> its extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; the <hi>Thred</hi> being ≈ømall and ≈øtrong, mu≈øt be twice wound about the neck of the Tumor, and tied with a double knot, which mu≈øt be ≈øtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ≈øame day, and ≈øo every day until the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor be deprived of its colour, ≈øen≈øe and life, which is within ≈øeven or eight days; then 'tis to be taken off with a crooked Knife, which is very ea≈øie to perform, ≈øeeing neither any great pain or flux of Blood is to be feared: If the <hi>Thred</hi> be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52336:136"/>
wet in Mercurial or Ar≈øenick-water, it ha≈øtens the mortification of this Tumor: But in this Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Phlegmatick Body is required; for in other Bodies pain and inflamation do ≈øo much afflict the Patient, that 'tis ≈øeldom that the <hi>Thred</hi> in a ≈øhort time ≈øhould take them off; yet the Chirurgeon may to le≈ø≈øen the Symptoms, and to cool, anoint with a Feather the part which the <hi>Thred</hi> toucheth, with white camphorated Ointment, of Ro≈øes, or the like, continually putting the Patients in mind how that others bear it more quietly.</p>
                        <p>But if you de≈øign to u≈øe a <hi>Knife</hi> only, the whole Tumor mu≈øt be endeavoured to be taken away, except you will con≈øume the remaining by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which is very rarely effected; be≈øides the Chirurgeon mu≈øt have a Care that he divides not the greater Ve≈ø≈øels, le≈øt there follows a Flux of Blood not to be ≈øtopped.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Vi≈øcerous Fle≈øh</hi> belongs rather to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øicians care, than the Chirurgeons.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Of the <hi>Glandulous Fle≈øh</hi> we have treated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in ≈øeveral places. In general 'tis to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1. That the <hi>Glandules</hi> are of a <hi>cold tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> therefore require hot Medicines, but very ill ≈øuffers cold. 2. The <hi>Tunicle inve≈øting them, being eroded or divided,</hi> the Skin cannot be con≈øolidated, before the whole Glandule, together with its Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, be con≈øumed with the Ulcer. 3.

                     <p>IT hath been long di≈øputed, whether the Fat, Hair and Nails ought to be accounted Parts of the Body, or Excrements. I neither think them Excrements, nor Parts properly ≈øo call'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Not Excrements,</hi> for they are Bodies, enjoying with the re≈øt Life and Nouri≈øhment, but not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhing others, and are of ≈øingular u≈øe for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They are not Parts properly ≈øo call'd,</hi> being de≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any certain bounds, and have no particular operation: Fat nouri≈øheth in Famine; the Hair and Nails, without injury to the whole, may be cut off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adeps,</hi> or <hi>Fat, is a ≈øimilar, ≈øoft, white, in≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part, made to pre≈øerve the Natural Heat, to help Chylification, to facilitate Motion, to moi≈øten the Parts, and to nouri≈øh the Body in Famine.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hair is a ≈øimilar Part, produced by the wor≈øt part of the Blood, covering ≈øome Parts, and in ≈øome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner adorning them.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Nail is a ≈øimilar part, ≈øprung al≈øo from the impure≈øt part of the Blood, flexible, hard, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fingers from external injuries, as al≈øo adorning them.</hi> Its Root is joyned to a Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Blood wholly, or in part de≈øtitute of Fat, is not much to be commended; for its abundance con≈øtitutes fle≈øhy, its unctiou≈øne≈øs, fat Bodies, as where but little fat, lean; this fatne≈øs of the Blood di≈øper≈øed into the parts of the Body, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth into natural Fat more copiou≈øly in the cold parts, to wit, in the lower Belly, Brea≈øt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than in the hot. The≈øe Signs may confirm our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as often as they are required from the Blood, after the opening of a Vein; for the upper part of the Blood, which is erroneou≈øly taken by many, to be the Phlegm of the Body, and ≈øo the vitious part, oftentimes is the very be≈øt of it: This may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øhed by the Fire; for if it be fat, it will flame; if Phlegm, it u≈øeth to crackle; hence it comes to pa≈øs, that the Fat, when it is any ob≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Cure of an external Di≈øea≈øe, may be cut off without any pain, or other inconvenience.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the Generation of the Blood, and its Circulation.</head>
                     <p>WE have hitherto treated of the Similar Parts, properly and improperly ≈øo call'd; from whom are the Di≈ø≈øimilars compounded. The Blood ≈øerves to their Con≈øervation, as doth the Spirits to the Actions from thence proceeding; but how the Blood is generated in our Body, and how many Spirits are there found, is not as yet ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently under≈øtood by us. In this thing Writers differ among them≈øelves, ≈øo that the very Truth ≈øeems to lie hid in the profounde≈øt darkne≈øs; yet the love and de≈øire of ≈øearching out the Truth exactly, gives me freedom to declare my Opinion, yet ≈øtill giving place to a better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sanguification</hi> I conceive to be performed after this manner: The harder Meat received in by the Mouth, chawed by the Teeth, and by the <hi>Spittle</hi> moi≈øtened, is in ≈øome manner prepared to be made Chyle.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Spittle,</hi> from whence it hath its beginning, no man as I know of, hath rightly demon≈øtrated: Tho≈øe that derived it from the Veins and Arteries, it is upon this rea≈øon, becau≈øe they communicate ≈øeveral Branches to the Maxillerary Glandules, through which the late invented <hi>Ductus Salivales</hi> pa≈øs; and moreover, a Salivation rai≈øed by Art, ≈øeems to confirm this Opinion.</p>
                     <p>But how the Arteries and Nerves can ≈øeparate
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52336:140"/>
≈øo great a quantity of <hi>Spittle,</hi> as we have often known to have been thrown forth in ≈øo ≈øhort a time, ≈øeems not po≈ø≈øible to me, I do rather derive it from the <hi>Stomach</hi> and <hi>Limphaducts,</hi> which I ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to adhere to the Salivals, upon the following Rea≈øons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As often as voluntary ≈øwallowing is de≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we ob≈øerve the Spittle to a≈øcend as it were from the Stomach into the Mouth it ≈øelf, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the Meat be moi≈øtened by Drink.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Tongue, Mouth and the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach have inwardly a common Tunicle.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Meat in the Mouth, as in like manner in the Ventricle, ought to be mixt with Spittle.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It would be very trouble≈øome continually to drink in eating; for it is very ea≈øie for ≈øome time to keep the devoured Liquor in the Stomach, and then ≈øen≈øibly to communicate ≈øome part of it to the Mouth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Limphaducts are di≈øper≈øed through the whole Body, and they go both unto the Stomach and Tongue.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. I judge no Humor to be thrown out of our Body, except by peculiar pa≈ø≈øages; and ≈øo for ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rea≈øons, I think the Tears al≈øo to be ≈øhed though particular Channels, which a more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hand (whether mine or others) may ≈øometimes find out: Yea, the mo≈øt Noble <hi>Lewis Bills,</hi> the great Anatomi≈øt, atte≈øts to have already di≈øcover'd them and promi≈øeth to demon≈øtrate them in the Body, and in Figures to the Favourers of Truth.</p>
                     <p>If you enquire of me of what nature <hi>Spittle</hi> is, I an≈øwer, that it is <hi>Salt</hi>; yet 'tis not always nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary that this ≈øaltne≈øs be perceived by the Tongue, which tho≈øe that Under≈øtand the Nature
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52336:141"/>
of Artificial Salts, ≈øufficiently know: It is certain that there is ≈øome natural Salt in all Meats and Drinks; 'tis al≈øo certain, that Salt not only helps the commixing and concoction of the Meat, but al≈øo contributes much to the fermentation of the Humors.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ductus Salivales,</hi> which we have now made mention of, have but one ≈øtrong <hi>Tunicle,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Ureters, but that they are le≈ø≈øer.</p>
                     <p>Of each ≈øide <hi>one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They <hi>take their Original,</hi> endued with many Roots, from a certain great Glandule, lying under the Tendon of the <hi>Mu≈øculus Diga≈øtricus,</hi> not far from the upper Part of the Jaw; then they run under the Tongue, above the great Nerve of our eighth Pare, to the more inward parts of the mouth, where, in the two ranine Glandules, near the bridle of the Tongue, they terminate; from whom being variou≈øly perforated, i≈ø≈øues out the Spittle into the Mouth; of which, the enquiring Reader may more largely ≈øatisfie his curio≈øity, out of the Writings of <hi>Gli≈ø≈øon</hi> and <hi>Van-Horn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Meat thus chewed by the Teeth, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Mouth, through the <hi>Gullet,</hi> by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of proper Mu≈øcles, is carried into the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which that it may the better keep it, it pre≈øently pur≈øeth it ≈øelf together, ≈øo that the <hi>upper Orifice</hi> is clo≈øe ≈øhut, but the <hi>lower</hi> not ≈øo ≈øtraight, that though very lightly pre≈ø≈øed, may there find pa≈ø≈øage.</p>
                     <p>The Meat received by the Stomach, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtened by Spittle, Drink, and its own humidity, forthwith by the heat of the Stomach, begins to be concocted; the <hi>Order</hi> is not ob≈øerved here, which was in the eating of the Meat; yet in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52336:141"/>
I have ob≈øerved the Meat to be di≈øpo≈øed in the ≈øame order, as it was devoured by the Animal that was di≈ø≈øected; but afterwards the Stomack continually dige≈øting, fir≈øt ≈øends away that Meat which is of ea≈øie≈øt Dige≈øtion, to the Guts, and it doth not detain it, whil≈øt the other is al≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, which Loo≈øne≈ø≈øes and Vomiting evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough declare, if you look into the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>The Meat being concocted, a≈ø≈øumes a white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs like to Cream, and this is called <hi>Chile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chile</hi> out of the <hi>≈øtomach through the Pylorus</hi> enters the <hi>Inte≈øtines,</hi> in which pa≈ø≈øage there is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peri≈øtaltick motion: Out of this the <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> ≈øuck what is u≈øeful to nouri≈øh the parts; and the unu≈øeful is ca≈øt out through the Belly: The <hi>Venae Lacteae</hi> con≈øi≈øt of one very thin Tunicle, but are endowed with ≈øeveral Valves, extended from the Liver towards the Glandules, they are di≈øtributed through all the Me≈øentery, and ≈øo are carried for the mo≈øt part to the ≈ømall Guts, e≈øpecially the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junum</hi>; but yet the great Guts are not altogether de≈øtitute of them, that none of the Nutriment may be lo≈øt.</p>
                     <p>From the Inte≈øtine, both the≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels and the Chile contain'd in them, go to the three <hi>Glandules of the Chile,</hi> the greate≈øt of which is in the middle of the Me≈øentery, called by <hi>A≈øellius, Pancreas</hi>; the two le≈ø≈øer are call'd the <hi>Lumbar Glandules,</hi> ≈øituate near the left Kidney.</p>
                     <p>Each of the≈øe <hi>Glandules</hi> ≈øend forth a Branch, which joining above the left Kidney, con≈øtitutes a Ve≈ø≈øel called <hi>Vena Lactea,</hi> about the bigne≈øs of a great quill.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>great Lactean Vein,</hi> lying between the <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:52336:142"/>
aorta,</hi> and the <hi>Vertebra's</hi> of the Loins, cover'd with Fat, runs upwards, and above the Heart, a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends by the Gullet, and ≈øo ha≈øtens to the <hi>left Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavial Vein,</hi> where it ends in one, two or three branches; here a mo≈øt thin valve occurs at the very end of the Vein looking inwardly, that the Chyle might not return back again, or run further into the Arm; out of this Subclavial they de≈øcend by the <hi>a≈øcending Trunk of Vena Cava</hi> into the <hi>right Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Heart,</hi> that there by the help of the heat, and natural quality, it may be changed into Blood.</p>
                     <p>Being converted into Blood, it pa≈ø≈øeth by the <hi>Pulmoniack Artery</hi> to the Lungs, which are by part of it nouri≈øhed, and the re≈øt of it goes through the <hi>Pulmoniack Vein</hi> to the left Ventricle of the Heart, that it may be more perfectly elaborated; thence by the great Artery is carried to all the parts of the Body, communicating to them nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhment for the pre≈øervation of Life.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe ways of Conveyance is di≈øplea≈øing to ≈øome, who would rather retain that by the Me≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raick veins known, and ≈øo greatly cried up by the Ancients, than admit of a new Truth; therefore they ≈øay that the Chile, together with the Blood, may by this way be mo≈øt conveniently carryed to the Liver, ≈øeeing that the Venal Blood is carried not from the Liver to the Guts (which was the fal≈øe Opinion of the Ancients) but from the <hi>Guts</hi> to the <hi>Liver,</hi> and ≈øo not here to be allowed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motion of each Liquor, already ≈øufficiently known.</p>
                     <p>But in truth the≈øe Opinions they defend, rather by a probable Ratiocination, out of their old affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Liver, than that they can make it out by natural or demon≈øtrative Arguments, or an≈øwer the≈øe Queries following.</p>
                     <p n="1">

                        <hi>That part of the Blood which is not altogether u≈øele≈øs, yet not fit for Nutrition,</hi> pa≈ø≈øeth out of the <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> ever joyned together by Ino≈øculations with the <hi>Veins,</hi> into the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta,</hi> and ≈øo by their means is brought again into the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> that it may be amended, and again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted.</p>
                     <p>I do not only ≈øay that the Blood is carried by the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> into the <hi>Heart,</hi> but al≈øo by the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> into the <hi>Liver,</hi> which I prove by the≈øe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Liver is the bigge≈øt of all the Vi≈øcera</hi>; not that I would infer its pre-eminence from its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs (≈øee <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) but I ≈øuppo≈øe Nature would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have created ≈øo great a Body, but for the performing of ≈øome extraordinary operation.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Its colour is red.</hi> I well know that it is ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ob≈øerved to be white, pallid, yellow, green; but this colour is to be a≈øcribed to the Di≈øea≈øe, not to its natural Con≈øtitution; for in all Bodies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ≈øound, it is found red.</p>
                     <p>What wonder is it, that the Liver being red, in weakne≈øs ≈øhould contract a whitene≈øs; doth not a red face grow pale, when the Body is affected with ≈øickne≈øs? How ea≈øily likewi≈øe that the Liver ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Choler, ≈øhould be died with a yellow or green colour? 'Tis al≈øo ob≈øerved in the fir≈øt xx or xxx days after conception, it is naturally white, neither becomes red before the maternal Blood (concerning which, ≈øome of the Moderns have far otherwi≈øe a≈øcribed) comes to the nouri≈øhment of the already formed parts, which is the ≈øame in all <hi>Spermatick parts,</hi> even in the Heart it ≈øelf: But will you conclude from hence, that this red colour only happens to the Liver, and is not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it, than it is to the Mu≈øcles, which yet therefore do not make Blood? To this I an≈øwer, that the affluent Blood is ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary here, and ≈øo appropriated to the Liver, that without it it cannot be called a perfect Liver; but both the colour, ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance and number of Ve≈ø≈øels are ≈øo difierent in a Mu≈øcle, and in the Liver, that in no wi≈øe the parts de≈øerve to be ≈øaid to be like one another; and what

ab≈øurdity is it to ≈øay; that <hi>a Mu≈øcle ≈øanguifies,</hi> when even the Heart it ≈øelf by the principal A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomi≈øts and Philo≈øophers, is acknowledged a Mu≈øcle.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>The Maternal Blood comes fir≈øt up the Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Vein to the Liver, ere it goes to the Heart of the Infant:</hi> And the Valves and Ligatures evidently demon≈øtrate, that the Arterial Blood is carried by the Umbilick Arteries from the Child to the Womb, but the Venal by the Umbilick Vein from the Womb to the Child; but whether the <hi>Infant</hi> is nouri≈øhed by the Maternal Blood, or by an External Humor, like as a Chicken in the Egg, is to me all one; when 'tis evident, the Blood, which either coming from the <hi>Mother</hi> or <hi>Infant,</hi> pa≈ø≈øeth fir≈øt to the Liver, before it enters the Heart.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>The Choler is ≈øeparated from the Blood in the Liver</hi>; for every one knows, that there can no ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration be made, without there be fir≈øt a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
                     <p>From all the≈øe Arguments I cannot gather any thing, but that the returning Blood is carried by the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> to the Liver, that it may there be purified, and in ≈øome manner concocted, in which its operation, that the Blood may be rendred more perfect, 'tis carried to the Heart, e≈øpecially when by rea≈øon of its continual and nece≈ø≈øary Pul≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Blood cannot remain long in the Heart: and for this rea≈øon I judge, the whole Blood mu≈øt needs be moved about with a circular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Blood made in the Liver, as is declared but now in the eighth Chapter, enters the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and from thence into the Heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:52336:144"/>And thus the Royal Liver, at the ≈øame time, when Kings are taken away, may yet u≈øe a limited power, and may remain with honour in its own Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>But what ≈øhall we do with the Melancholick Spleen, which makes many laugh? It hath many accu≈øers, and not fewer excu≈øers.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was never accounted by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Learned <hi>Greek,</hi> a receptacle of the Excrements; or is it any where to be found in him, that he call'd the Spleen another Liver.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The great number of Veins and Arteries, and ≈øo by con≈øequence the abundance of Vital Spirits, do not permit the Excrements to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected here.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It hath not any convenient Cavity wherein the Melancholy, Faeculent Juice can be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And if you imagine that there is no nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here of a Cavity, its Parenchyma is too thick, and not porous enough, therefore unfit for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ≈øo thick a Humor; which al≈øo is never naturally found in it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It is too great a Bowel to perform ≈øo vile an Office.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. In dead men, where Melancholine≈øs hath been the cau≈øe of their death, upon the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Internal parts, there none of them le≈øs recede from its natural ≈øtate than the Spleen, the Heart only excepted, whom the Vital Spirits do ≈øo greatly defend, that it is le≈øs affected than other parts, which ≈øeldom happen to the Inte≈øtines, Kidneys, Gall and Bladder.</p>
                     <p>What is therefore its <hi>U≈øe</hi>? It elaborates the Acid Humor, which is very nece≈ø≈øary, but not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:52336:144"/>
Excrementitious, and mingles it as a Ferment with the Blood, by which it becomes more perfect, and fitter for Circulation.</p>
                     <p>In my judgment the Salt of the Blood affords matter to this Humor, which it greatly requires that it may not be corrupted; but this Salt which proceeds from the Meat and drink, is never ≈øo pure, but that it hath need to be brought to a more perfect ≈øtate in our Body. But this is my Opinion.</p>
                     <p>The Supreme≈øt of the Kings is the Heart; to this are two others ≈øubject, the Liver and Spleen (I be≈øeech you give me leave to make u≈øe of this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude in favour of the Ancients) the Heart makes the Blood, the <hi>Liver</hi> repeats the Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ≈øeparates the Choler; the <hi>Spleen</hi> from its own Salt, by an innate vigor, produceth an Acid Humor, which as a Ferment by the Venal Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Branch, it mixeth with the Blood, to render it the perfecter, and the more fit for Circulation; if any Excrementitious part ≈øhould be there ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, it is all by the Caeliack Artery, and the Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhodal Ve≈ø≈øels ≈øent to the Guts.</p>
                     <p>If it appears to any one to be a contradictory, that by Salt a Humor ≈øhould be made Acid, we advi≈øe that per≈øon to ta≈øte ≈øome Spirit of Salt.</p>
                     <p>About ≈øixteen years ≈øince, the great Anatomi≈øt <hi>Franci≈øcus Sylvius</hi> put forth ≈øome particular things concerning the u≈øe of the <hi>Spleen</hi>; he was of opinion, that the Blood was not made in the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles</hi> of the Heart, neither that it was carried from the Heart by the Arteries to all the parts of the Body, for nouri≈øhment-≈øake alone, but that it likewi≈øe underwent ≈øome other Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the re≈øt of the <hi>Vi≈øcera</hi>'s, particularly <hi>that the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52336:145"/>
Spleen further concocts the Arterial Blood, and brings it to a higher degree, yea that it more then perfects it,</hi> ≈øo that the Blood in a manner in this place a≈ø≈øumes the nature of Ferment, by who≈øe means in a ≈øhort time, a great quantity of Ma≈øs may become acid; in the ≈øame manner he affirms, that the Blood more and more concocted in the Spleen there receives ≈øtrength, by which it re≈øtores the returned and weakned Blood, and preparing together with it the Chile, that it may the ≈øooner be turned into Blood: The Rea≈øons which he produceth for it, are the≈øe:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spleen receives a much greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood from the Heart, than is nece≈ø≈øary, for its nouri≈øhment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it can be returned back again to the Heart, by no other way than by the Branches of the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> and <hi>Porta</hi>; for what hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been delivered of the ≈øhort Ve≈ø≈øel, are to be accounted but ridiculous Fictions, as may mo≈øt evidently be made appear in di≈ø≈øected Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Seeing this Blood is continually mix'd with the returned Blood and Chile in its pa≈ø≈øage to the Heart, it ought not to be an Excrement; for ≈øo the Noble Parts, and the whole Body would not be purged, but the more injured.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Chymi≈øtry hath long ≈øince taught us, that ≈øuch mutations happen daily in Nature.</p>
                     <p>The Remaining Part of the Blood unu≈øeful to the Body, therefore Excrementious, is thrown out through the <hi>Guts, Ureters, and Parts of the Skin, &amp;c.</hi> concerning which it is not nece≈ø≈øary to add more here; but now we are forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe tho≈øe new watry pa≈ø≈øages, which the ≈øtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52336:145"/>
in Anatomy have long and diligently inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into. The <hi>watery pa≈ø≈øages,</hi> the <hi>Lymphatick Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels</hi> have their ri≈øe both from the <hi>Liver,</hi> and from the <hi>Joints,</hi> and receive the liquid Juice from the Arteries with which they corre≈øpond.</p>
                     <p>Tho≈øe which come from the <hi>Liver,</hi> embrace the <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and ≈øo pa≈øs to the Mi≈øaraick Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules of the Chile, as do tho≈øe al≈øo that a≈øcend from the Feet; thence they di≈øcharge their Water into the great Lacteal Vein, which as we have already declared, carries the Chile to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Tho≈øe which proceed from the Arm, both lie above and under the Veins, until they come to the Subclavial Vein, which they enter about the ≈øame place; where the great Lacteal Vein doth, being furni≈øhed with a particular Valve ju≈øt at their entrance, and ≈øo altogether they carry the Water to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>This Water is Sweet, not being as Urine is, Salt.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels con≈øi≈øt of a very thin Tunicle, whence they are ≈øoon broke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>U≈øe</hi> of them in my opinion, is to take the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Water from the Arteries, and carry it to the <hi>Glandules</hi> of the Chile, and Lacteal Vein, by which the Chile being made more Liquid, may the more conveniently be conveyed through the narrower pa≈ø≈øages, thence to return the ≈øame to the Arterial Blood, making it fitting to ≈øerve to the nutrition of the moi≈øt parts, and to the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moi≈øtening of the hot.</p>
                     <p>But that it may the more clearly appear, in what manner I conceive, how what hath already been ≈øaid, is perform'd in our Body; ob≈øerve that the Meat is converted in the Stomach into Chile,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52336:146"/>
to which part of the Drink is mingled, this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is carried through the Glandules of the Chile, and the great Lacteal Vein into the Heart, where it is changed into Blood, which is by means of the Arteries to be conveyed through the whole Body; every part of this Blood nouri≈øheth tho≈øe parts which are of the like temperament with it ≈øelf; the Hot part of it nouri≈øheth the Hot; the Dry, the Dry; the Moi≈øt, the Moi≈øt, &amp;c. that which is here not well concocted, mu≈øt be brought back again to be perfected. Why we ≈øay that the Veins are not ≈øufficient, and the pa≈ø≈øages not commodious enough to perform the ≈øame, who≈øe Office we know is to bring back to the Heart the Blood not ≈øufficiently concocted; the Rea≈øon is that the Water always remaining in the Ve≈ø≈øels, rendered the Blood too thin, ≈øo deprived it of its natural con≈øi≈øtence and ≈øtrength.</p>
                     <p>From all tho≈øe ≈øo clearly and di≈øtinctly laid down, it ≈øufficiently appears what the CIRCU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATION OF THE BLOOD is, to wit, <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion of the Blood out of the Arteries into the</hi> Vena Cava <hi>and</hi> Porta <hi>to the Liver and Heart, that in them it may be fitted for the Nutrition and the life of the whole Body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of the ≈øubtile≈øt part of the Blood are the SPIRITS produced, which are two-fold:</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Ductus Salivales,</hi> when the ≈øtring of the Tongue is to be cut, or the Ranine Vein to be opened, or any other Di≈øea≈øe of the Tongue that is to be cured by Manual Operation, warn you to have great care of tho≈øe little Glandules in which they end, that they might not be hurt with the Launcet, le≈øt there follow a continual ≈øpitting.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>great Glandule</hi> al≈øo of the <hi>Neck,</hi> from whence the≈øe Ductus's take their ri≈øe, when it is inflamed, admits not of the u≈øe of Mercury; for from hence a dangerous Salivation may very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily be rai≈øed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> either the greater or the le≈ø≈øer, are oftentimes from a Contu≈øion or Wound ≈øo greviou≈øly hurt, that they cannot carry the Chile to the Heart; and though the wound be cured with great diligence, care, and ≈øpeed, yet the Patient will fall into a Con≈øumption, whence follows Death inevitably: This Truth will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Chirurgeons from many Calumnies.</p>
                        <p>In Children, and older People, is often perceiv'd an induration and inflamation of the Abdomen; the cau≈øe of which is the hardne≈øs of the Me≈øaraic Glandules, which allow not pa≈ø≈øage for the Chile to the great Lecteal Vein, except the very thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt of it; whence the fle≈øh of the Mu≈øcles wa≈øts, the Body becomes heavy and weary, and at length a Feaver, and a wa≈øting of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This evil I u≈øe to remedy without any great trouble, with this External Liniment.</p>
                        <p>Take compound Oyntment of Mar≈øhmallows
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52336:147"/>
Ointment of Sow-bread, of Martiaton, of each two drams; Oyl of white Lillies, of Camomile, of each three drams: Mix it into an Ointment.</p>
                        <p>Inwardly the following Troches are excellent, being continually u≈øed the whole time of the Cure.</p>
                        <p>Take prepared Steel, prepared Crabs-Eyes, of each a ≈øcruple; Vitriolated Tartar, half a dram; <hi>Sal Prunella,</hi> xvj. grains; <hi>Species Aromatici Ro≈øati,</hi> a ≈øcruple; white Sugar, two ounces: Make them into Troches according to Art.</p>
                        <p>In this ca≈øe <hi>Purging</hi> is not to be u≈øed, but with <hi>Ca≈ø≈øia,</hi> Cream of Tartar, and Laxative Syrups; for the <hi>Glandules</hi> will not bear ≈øtrong Purges.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Blood taken out upon the opening a Vein, oftentimes after ≈øome few hours ≈øpace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very dry, and de≈øtitute of all <hi>Serum,</hi> which for the mo≈øt part is a≈øcrib'd to its too great Heat, and Adu≈øtion: but this Argument is very invalid for if the ≈øame day, the ≈øame, or another Vein be again opened, there will be found a great quantity of <hi>Serum</hi> in the Blood; therefore the true Cau≈øe is to be deduc'd from the Circulation of the Blood, but e≈øpecially in the <hi>Lymphatick Ve≈ø≈øels,</hi> which at that time draws the <hi>Serum</hi> and <hi>Humidity,</hi> and ≈øo leaves the Blood dry.</p>
                        <p>It very often al≈øo happens, that the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Tumid, Turgid</hi> and <hi>Languid,</hi> upon which the fearful Phy≈øitian forthwith pronounces nought but dangers.</p>
                        <p>When with the u≈øe of Internal and External <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> the Patient in a ≈øhort time may be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: The Cau≈øe of this Di≈øea≈øe is not from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature and debility of tho≈øe parts the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents call'd Noble; for it may ea≈øily be di≈øtingui≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Drop≈øie,</hi> which the≈øe parts occa≈øion;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52336:147"/>
for although the ≈øick per≈øons are very dull and weary, yet are they not anxious, but breath free, and the Belly ≈øwells not much. In the Face, and Joynts e≈øpecially, is a watry Matter collected; but if the ≈øwell'd parts are compre≈ø≈øed by the Finger, we perceive much le≈øs <hi>Serum</hi> to be contained in the parts, than in a true <hi>Drop≈øie</hi>; from whence tho≈øe that under≈øtand not the true Cau≈øe, are wont to a≈øcribe this Inflammation to wind: But the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick Ve≈ø≈øels</hi> when compre≈øt, broke, or by any other way ob≈øtructed, ≈øo that the natural motion of the <hi>Lympha</hi> is hindred, occa≈øions this evil.</p>

                     <p>THE Head, as Supream Lord, both of its own, and of a thou≈øand other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not only governs it ≈øelf, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers well, when formed with a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Con≈øtitution, and in≈øtructed with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its own Office; but they live a mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, who≈øe Head is not ju≈øtly and with Art compo≈øed, and who neither enquire into, or know its Sub≈øtance or Figure.</p>
                     <p>Its <hi>Figure</hi> is Oval, the upper part is call'd <hi>Vertex,</hi> the fore-part <hi>Frons,</hi> the hinder-part <hi>Occip√∫t,</hi> the ≈øides <hi>Temples,</hi> the re≈øt is call'd the <hi>Face,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts of the following parts.</p>

                     <p>The Bones which lie under the≈øe <hi>Membranes,</hi> fir≈øt we divide into the Skull and Jaws, then into many other Bones.</p>

                     <p>The upper <hi>Jaw</hi> is compo≈øed of eleven Bones, of each ≈øide five, the odd eleventh is placed in the middle.</p>

                                    <p>
                                       <hi>I</hi> Will truly declare to you my Opinion concerning the Que≈øtion I informed you I had moved in the company of ≈øome Phy≈øicians, which was, Why the Bones
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:52336:151"/>
which lie under the temporal Mu≈øcles, are not cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inve≈øted by the <hi>Pericranium</hi> as are the other Bones.</p>
                                    <p>On the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>Janaury 1654,</hi> being commanded by the Honourable Senate of this City, to open the Head of <hi>PETER JACOBS,</hi> Brick layer, then was my Opinion, which I had been hitherto big withal, ≈øufficiently confirmed; for as ≈øoon as I had ob≈øerved a great depre≈ø≈øion in the upper part of the Skull, I al≈øo found a great quantity of coagulated Blood, which had part of it pa≈øt through the Ears, and part of it remained yet in the Cavity of the Ear; then being very de≈øirous to know the way by which this Blood had de≈øcended into the Cavity of the Ear; which, when I had diligently enquired into, I al≈øo di≈øcovered the rea≈øon and cau≈øe wherefore the <hi>Pericranium</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in this place the temporal Mu≈øcles, and not the Bone under them.</p>
                                    <p>Fir≈øt, The Opinion and the An≈øwer (which the Honourable and Experienced Dr. <hi>TULPH</hi> Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øter of <hi>Am≈øterdam,</hi> had given to the propounded Que≈øtion, to wit from whence this Blood ≈øhould come, which very often in Wounds of the Head flows out of the Ears?) I found to be true and rea≈øonable; for I perceived, as the Noble Con≈øul had affirmed to me, that the Blood from the upper part of the Head, did de≈øcend between the Skull and <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and ≈øo did enter the ≈øpace that is between the <hi>Os Parietale</hi> and <hi>Petro≈øum,</hi> and from thence to be as it was ≈øtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a Sieve into the Cavity of the Ear; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in ≈øearching further, I found the <hi>Os Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øum</hi> to be removed a great di≈øtance from the <hi>Os Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietale;</hi> ≈øo that in the place where the Bones did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from each other, was a motion ob≈øerved, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the <hi>Os Petro≈øum,</hi> and ending in the <hi>Os Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietale,</hi>
                                       <pb n="273" facs="tcp:52336:151"/>
there where the Toothy unition in the <hi>Os Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> in the inward part, which is covered with a Callus (as it ought to be in every Articulation) to hinder brui≈øing, is ob≈øerved.</p>
                                    <p>And this being ≈øo, it may be concluded, that the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> if it had inve≈øted the Bone under the temporal Mu≈øcles, without all doubt it would have pa≈ø≈øed it ≈øelf between the <hi>Os Petro≈øum,</hi> whence from its moving and rubbing in eating, ≈øpeaking, or any other Motion, would haue always felt intollerable pain. Thus have you, Sir, what I thought (hoping to proceed further) the rea≈øon to the Que≈øtion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>This Opinion is indeed judicious, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; for in dead Mens Skuls the upper Bone of the Temple is movable as is the lower; and in the Suture of the <hi>Zygomatick</hi> Bone, is a Cartilage found, which is nece≈ø≈øary in every Joynt; for I confe≈øs the motion is little, but greater would not be required than what ≈øufficeth to afford pa≈ø≈øage to the thick Humors, either from External or from Internal Cau≈øes, collected ≈øometimes in the Cavity of the Ear, by the which the Brain and Ears may be freed from many and various incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences: I hope time and diligence will give us greater light in this thing.</p>

otherwi≈øe they may be taken away by a Thred, or what is better, by a Knife, when they reject other Remedies.

                     <p>NOw we approach <hi>Palas</hi>'s Tower, which is ≈øometimes empty, and ≈øometimes fill'd with <hi>Folly</hi>; wherein, if <hi>an ill mind,</hi> be, as it were, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Inhabitant, <hi>Virtue</hi> mu≈øt prudently look to it ≈øelf; but yet let it continue its Dominion, whil≈øt its Enemy in the mean time lurking in ≈øome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ≈øhall no where be at quiet.</p>
                     <p>Before we can enter into it, and look into the Brain, there are two Curtains to be drawn open, the <hi>Pia</hi> and <hi>Dura Mater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dura Mater</hi> in the out≈øide rougher than in the in≈øide, encompa≈ø≈øeth the Brain very loo≈øly, le≈øt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:52336:161"/>
its Arbitrary Motion ≈øhould be hindred, dividing the ≈øame by the help of certain foldings, which is call'd <hi>Falx,</hi> into the right and left part, and al≈øo ≈øeparating it from the <hi>Cerebellum.</hi> In this <hi>Falx</hi> are always found four Cavities, ≈øometimes ≈øeven; in which many of the branches of the <hi>Carotide-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> are in≈øerted, afterwards joining with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Veins.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe Cavities have the u≈øe and ≈øub≈øtance of Veins, ≈øo that they may not unproperly be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the Veins.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is more ≈øen≈øible, &amp; hath more Arteries than the <hi>Dura,</hi> which doth not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve≈øt the whole Brains, but al≈øo enters the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where; which, for this cau≈øe may more ea≈øily be ≈øeparated.</p>
                     <p>We do divide the Brain into three Parts, which are, 1. <hi>The Brain it ≈øelf.</hi> 2. The <hi>Spinal Marrow.</hi> 3. The <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> or little Brain.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Brain</hi> is of an A≈øhy colour, and of a ≈øofter <hi>≈øub≈øtance</hi> than Marrow (which is both whiter and ≈øolider) whence al≈øo it was wont to be call'd <hi>Rind</hi>; it receives ≈øeveral Branches from the <hi>Carotide-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> and is de≈øtitute both of Nerves and Sen≈øe.</p>
                     <p>It hath divers <hi>turnings</hi> and <hi>windings,</hi> which fold in deeply, e≈øpecially tho≈øe in the fore-part of the Head, where the <hi>great Fi≈ø≈øure</hi> divides the Brain outwardly even to the Marrow.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Marrow</hi> is the Mother of all Nerves; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Skull 'tis call'd the <hi>Marrow</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi>; but without it is termed the <hi>Spinal Marrow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> or little <hi>Brain,</hi> is more of an A≈øh-colour than White, receives <hi>Arteries</hi> from the <hi>Cervicalis</hi> and <hi>Carotide</hi>; yet there are fewer bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches here than in the Brain, as being much le≈øs.</p>

                     <p>In the fore-part the≈øe Ventricles are united, and make a third.</p>
                     <p>In this third Ventricle are two Cavities; the fir≈øt of them runs to the <hi>Infundibulum,</hi> and to the <hi>Glandula Pituitaria,</hi> the other to the fourth Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle contained in the <hi>Cerebellum</hi>; above this Ventricle are ob≈øerved four round Bodies, which are call'd <hi>Te≈øtes</hi> and <hi>Nates,</hi> to which joyns the <hi>Glandula Pinealis,</hi> which is fal≈øly call'd by ≈øome the ≈øeat of the Soul<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Of late the famous <hi>Sylvius</hi> hath demon≈øtrated it not to re≈øide in the <hi>Ventricles,</hi> but without them; by whom al≈øo it is e≈øteem'd but a Glandule: and that with more rea≈øon, becau≈øe that both he and I have found in it not ≈øeldom two or three Stones, but ≈øometimes four, which we yet keep by us.</p>
                     <p>The Bodies being removed, eight pair of Nerves appear, which we have already treated of; on the fore-part of whom joyns the <hi>Rete Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile</hi> of <hi>Galen,</hi> which is a complication of the Cervical and Carotide-Arteries.</p>

A≈øpera Arteria,</hi> or Wind-pipe; this lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gullet, and con≈øi≈øts of Cartilaginous Rings, and a double Membrane.</p>

                     <p>The annulary Cartilages are joyned together with Ligaments, and make not a perfect Circle, as being de≈øtitute of a fourth part that lies upon the Gullet.</p>
                     <p>The Wind-pipe di≈øtributes <hi>Branches</hi> through the whole Lungs, which are ≈øtrong enough, but not at all Cartaliginous.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> it ≈øelf con≈øi≈øts of a fle≈øhy, ≈øerene and hard ≈øub≈øtance, which is inve≈øted with a proper <hi>Tunicle,</hi> furni≈øhed with <hi>Fibres</hi> of all ≈øorts, and like a Mu≈øcle is continually moved.</p>

                     <p>In old people, the right Auricle is bigger than the left, which in Infants is the contrary; in the throwing forth of the Blood, the Auricles, as well as the Heart it ≈øelf, are pur≈øt together, and dilated as often as they take in the Blood; and this Con≈øtriction and Dilation makes the Pul≈øe.</p>
                     <p>For the concoction, reception and throwing forth of the Blood, it hath two Cavities, and four Ve≈ø≈øels.</p>
                     <p>The Cavities are di≈øtingui≈øhed by a fle≈øhy Divi≈øion, in which I could not yet find any way appointed for the motion of the Blood out of the right Ventricle into the left, although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Anatomi≈øts do certainly affirm it.</p>

                     <p>Its edges round about are fle≈øhy, variou≈øly movable like a Mu≈øcle, but its Center Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and very ≈øen≈øible.</p>
                     <p>It hath three perforations, 1. In the middle of it, through which the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> pa≈ø≈øeth. 2.

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:52336:187"/>
the Cure of this Di≈øea≈øe, an Experienced Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian may much more ≈øafely follow the Dictates of his own Rea≈øon, than adhire ≈øtrictly to the Method &amp; Pre≈øcriptions of others. For although it doth ≈øometimes by the more remarkable ≈øymptoms ≈øufficiently evidence it ≈øelf, yet we cannot likely di≈øcover its Nature and E≈ø≈øence, although we ≈øhould the mo≈øt indu≈øtriou≈øly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it.</p>
                     <p>But that we may cautiou≈øly enquire into it, we mu≈øt know that it is ≈øometimes not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by any Fever: And it is nece≈ø≈øary that what Phy≈øician ≈øoever is ignorant of this ≈øhould either by peru≈øing good Authors, or his own Experience, acquaint him≈øelf throughly with it. I have been ≈øent for to ≈øeveral Patients my ≈øelf, who although they appeared otherwi≈øe in good health, not refu≈øing their meat, nor di≈øturb'd in their ≈øleep, have neverthele≈øs had Buboes ari≈øing in their Groin, on their Neck, under their Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, or behind their Ears, which have apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly di≈øcovered a greater Malignity than could be di≈øcerned in tho≈øe Buboes, which in other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons have been attended by a violent Fever: And many hereupon who have been incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and lightly regarded the cautions which I have given them upon this account, have with great danger to them≈øelves experimented, that as ≈øoon as tho≈øe Buboes have ≈øunk down, the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilential Symptoms which have appear'd, have been very dreadful, and much more dangerous than in tho≈øe that have carefully u≈øed the means pre≈øcribed to them, who have been al≈øo much more ea≈øily and ≈øpeedily cured than the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="345" facs="tcp:52336:187"/>
                        <hi>Sometimes the Plague is accompanied with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>; and again, <hi>there are ≈øome Pe≈øtilent Fevers without the Plague.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To di≈øtingui≈øh this Fever from the Plague, I u≈øed to ob≈øerve, that they that are ≈øeized with it, complain of pain in their Head and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which ≈øometimes is di≈øper≈øed over the whole Body; ≈øometimes it confines it ≈øelf to the Arm-pits; the Neck, the Parts behind the Ears, or to the Groin. To outward appearance, there is not the lea≈øt ≈øwelling. If the Patient by ≈øuch means as is requi≈øite be provoked to ≈øweat at the beginning of the Di≈øea≈øe, the pain utterly cea≈øeth, and in a few dayes he will be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re≈øtored to his health, the Di≈øea≈øe not having at all di≈øcovered it ≈øelf<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> by any outward Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Why ≈øuch a Fever ≈øhould be accounted a Species of the Plague, I ≈øee no rea≈øon; But there is no one but will confe≈øs it to have ≈øeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that Body on which Buboes, Carbuncles, and Spots do outwardly appear.</p>
                     <p>The cau≈øe of the Plague is either <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External</hi>; but unto which ≈øoever we impute it, it is nece≈ø≈øary to conclude, that there is in it a power of di≈ø≈øolving the natural Con≈øi≈øtence of the Blood, and depriving the whole Body of its ≈øtrength.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Inward Cau≈øe,</hi> which is <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> it is evident to all, that it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in any Body what≈øoever ≈øo great &amp; ≈øudden a change; but it is mo≈øt certain, that by a long &amp; continued cour≈øe of bad Diet, the Blood may by degrees be after ≈øuch a manner di≈ø≈øolved, weakned, and corrupted, that ≈øome part of it a≈ø≈øuming to it ≈øelf a malignant quality; a man

may be ≈øurprized by a ≈øudden Di≈øea≈øe, &amp; ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be deprived of life it ≈øelf; which hath been ob≈øerved in ≈øick per≈øons at ≈øeveral times, when there hath been no contagion in the place, nor any ≈øu≈øpected, who have been troubled with perfect Buboes, and other Symptoms of the Plague, much more intolerable than others have been at any time when the Air hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>outward Cau≈øes,</hi> every one confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth that there are ≈øuch; but their Nature is known but to few: The Chymi≈øts, who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the force of Fire di≈øtinctly to ≈øeparate the Parts of ≈øimple Drugs, endeavour to find the Original of the Contagion in a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> which ≈øuddenly di≈ø≈øolves the fixed Salt of the Blood; which hath indeed ≈øome appearance of truth, though it will not be reli≈øhed by all men.</p>
                     <p>If you enquire into the Cau≈øe hereof from others, their an≈øwer will be various, but mo≈øt of them very idle and impertinent.</p>
                     <p>It hath by ≈øome been thought probable that a Plague might proceed from the <hi>Heavens</hi>; they affirming that the <hi>Stars</hi> do actuate the Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Bodies, both by the influence of their Light, and by ≈øeveral other qualities inherent in, and peculiar unto them. But the Conjectors rai≈øed from hence, are very uncertain, and the foundation of them un≈øecure. We are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Fopperies of A≈øtrology, and of the vanity of tho≈øe Predictions, which have no other Foundation than the ≈øeveral Cour≈øes, the Conjunction and Oppo≈øition of the Stars; which are all ≈øo frivolous, that we cannot think it worth our labour to refute them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:52336:188"/>We acknowledge that the <hi>Air</hi> may be ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways corrupted; from whence the Vapors which have been received from the Earth, are ≈øent down again among≈øt us, which like Fire may inkindle our Blood, <hi>Corrupt waters, Carca≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> either not at all buried, or el≈øe ≈øhallowly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred; the South-wind, which may be ≈øuppo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to promote the Putrefaction; <hi>Men</hi> already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, &amp; ≈øucce≈ø≈øively imparting the Contagion to the ≈øound, &amp; by that means ≈øpreading the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom through the Bodies of Men, &amp; the Air it≈øelf.</p>

                     <p>But all the≈øe things only inform us of the means by which this Pe≈øtilential Poy≈øon is conveyed unto us; but no one hath as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what it is, and wherein its Nature doth properly con≈øi≈øt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Symptoms of it are the≈øe.</hi> The ≈øick per≈øons are ≈øeized with a ≈øhivering all over their Body, which is pre≈øently followed with an inward heat, which is oft-times very inten≈øe, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great thir≈øt; ≈øomtimes the thir≈øt is exce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive, &amp; the Fever moderate. But whether the heat of the Fever be great or ≈ømall, it is mo≈øt commonly accompanied with a dryne≈øs of the Tongue, &amp; an Urine of the ≈øame con≈øtitution which you might expect from a man in perfect health: They are taken ≈øometimes with a great drow≈øine≈øs, ≈øometimes with a Dilirium, or with
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:52336:189"/>
an exce≈ø≈øive pain in the Head; &amp; in this ca≈øe, the white of the Eyes appeareth of a Saffron-colour, &amp; they are more wakeful than is con≈øi≈øtent with their ea≈øe &amp; quiet: great pain at the Heart, the Pul≈øe ≈øeems ≈ømall, if not at fir≈øt when you touch it lightly (for then it oftentimes appears to beat high) yet at lea≈øt when you pre≈øs it clo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with your Fingers. The ≈øtrength fails in the beginning of the Di≈øea≈øe, &amp; decrea≈øeth much more vi≈øibly than in the mo≈øt burning Fever, which hath no Malignity attending it. Some are taken with a <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> which can by no means be ≈øtopt: Others bleed much at the No≈øe, the Eyes, the Ears, or Mouth; ≈øome at the Yard or Womb. Some are troubled with a continual Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, others with a Nau≈øeou≈øne≈øs. On ≈øome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies there appear red or purple ≈øpots; &amp; on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Buboes behind their Ears, on their Neck, under their Chin, in the Groin, and under the Arm-pits: In ≈øome there break forth red Wheals or Pu≈øhes; in others white Bladders, or Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And where≈øoever the≈øe Bladders, Buboes, Carbuncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do appear, they are a mo≈øt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øign of the Plague, although the bigne≈øs of them may be incon≈øiderable; e≈øpecially if they either accompany, or are Con≈øequents of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>As to the Progno≈øticks, we mu≈øt con≈øider, that the Plague is a very treacherous Di≈øea≈øe, and whil≈øt it flatters us mo≈øt, it intends us the greate≈øt mi≈øchief. A Bubo is le≈øs dangerous than a Carbuncle, and a Carbuncle than the Spots, which very ≈øeldom portend le≈øs than pre≈øent death where≈øoever they are di≈øplay'd.</p>
                     <p>A Bubo behind the Ears, on the Neck, or
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:52336:189"/>
under the Arm-pits, is more dangerous than that in the Groin.</p>
                     <p>Carbuncles on the Hands and Feet, may by ≈øome be thought le≈øs pernicious, becau≈øe they are more remote from the Heart; but ≈øince they happen among≈øt many Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, they are more to be feared than tho≈øe which appear in other parts of the Body which are better covered with fle≈øh.</p>
                     <p>A Carbuncle ari≈øing after a Bubo, is a ≈øign of Death. If a Bubo or Carbuncle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Fever, there is le≈øs danger than if they follow it at a di≈øtance, and ari≈øe ≈ølowly.</p>
                     <p>A blew Circle encompa≈ø≈øing the Bubo the ≈øecond day after its appearance, is a ≈øign of Death.</p>
                     <p>If a Bubo ≈øuddenly di≈øappears, the ≈øtate of the Patient is dangerous, unle≈øs Nature di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth the Malignant Humour to ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have often ob≈øerved, that upon the retreat of <hi>that Morbifick Matter</hi> which hath cau≈øed a Bubo in the Groin, there hath appeared a Gangrene in the Foot, and on the ≈øame ≈øide which was before affected, and many have by that means e≈øcaped.</p>
                     <p>If a Cupping-gla≈øs applied to the Patient, rai≈øeth no Bli≈øter, we may rea≈øonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his condition to be de≈øperate.</p>
                     <p>It is an infallible ≈øign of Death, if after Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terization, or the application of a Cupping-gla≈øs, the Carbuncle abates not in 12 or 24 hours, as likewi≈øe if there is no moi≈øture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from it; but if a Bladder appears, or any ≈øeparation of the matter be made

                     <p>A Carbuncle which ≈øeems to have a little tail, or pu≈øh at the end of it, is very dangerous, as are likewi≈øe tho≈øe which look white; which, unle≈øs the Fever doth very much abate, are certain forerunners of Death.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient that hath a Bubo in his Neck, or behind his Ears, be troubled with a pain in his Throat, and a difficulty in ≈øwallowing, and no con≈øiderable Inflammation appear, we have always found it a certain Rule, that in this ca≈øe he outlives not 12 or 15 hours.</p>
                     <p>Sleep more ≈øound than ordinary, <hi>Diliriums,</hi> waking often in the night, inflammation of the Eyes, pain at the Heart, a trembling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vul≈øion of the Joynts, are all very dangerous Symptoms, but do not always portend Death.</p>
                     <p>A great Fever without a pain at the Heart, is not ≈øo dangerous as a le≈ø≈øer, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with that Symptom.</p>
                     <p>The greatne≈øs of the danger may ≈øometimes be judged from the great dryne≈øs of the Tongue.</p>
                     <p>If by the admini≈øtration of <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> Sweat is not provoked, the Patient u≈øually mi≈øcarrieth.</p>
                     <p>A Flux of Blood was heretofore held dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in all Plagues; but in our Age, all that can either bleed at the No≈øe, or have their Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrua's, come off ≈øafe: We have no pre≈øident of any that have pi≈ø≈øed Blood; but a <hi>Di≈ø≈øentery</hi> is the ≈øign of an approaching Death.</p>

                     <p>This Stone, if I mi≈øtake not, is generated in the <hi>Gall</hi> of an Hog, for it is exceeding bitter; and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:52336:197"/>
though it be very hard, yet every time it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed, it abates ≈øomewhat of its quantity, which is di≈øcoverable by the Tincture which it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts to the Liquor.

It is more requi≈øite to u≈øe this following, which is agreeable for di≈øpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Vapours which infect the Head, and the heat about the Heart.</p>
                     <p>Take Salt of Rue, of <hi>Scordium, Prunella,</hi> of each half a ≈øcruple; Vitriolated Tartar, 8 grains; our Prophylactick Water, an ounce; Balm-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as much as ≈øufficeth; Syrup of Betony, an ounce: Mix them for a draught.</p>
                     <p>Let Sweat be thereby provoked, and let it be the care of the Attendants, that after the fir≈øt or ≈øecond day, the Patient may be kept from ≈øleep, if it be found that he hath ≈øtrength to bear it.</p>
                     <p>There is ≈øometimes joyn'd with the <hi>Fever, continual Watchings, and a great pain of the Head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I do not u≈øe to be much concerned for the watchings, although it ≈øhould continue for the fir≈øt three days without intermi≈ø≈øion, for it often falls out, that by the u≈øe of <hi>Sudorificks</hi> only, the pain is the fir≈øt day abated, on the 2d becomes tolerable, and on the third is quite taken away.</p>

I have ≈øometimes in this ca≈øe (though contrary to Cu≈øtom) given it ≈øparingly, when I have found the ≈øick per≈øon not to ≈øleep in the fir≈øt, ≈øecond or third days: But when he hath waked for ≈øix or ≈øeven days together, and found a great decay of ≈øtrength, this following Pre≈øcription, taken every quarter of an hour by a ≈øpoonful, till ≈øleep hath ≈øeized on him, hath afforded great relief, and the ≈øleep produced thereby, hath been undi≈øturbed, and of long continuance.</p>
                     <p>Take our Prophylactick-water, an ounce &amp; half; Borage-water, an ounce; Cinamon-water, three drams; Confection of Hyacinth, a dram; Lozenges of Sugar pearl'd, three drams; <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Opiat,</hi> two grains: Mix them.</p>
                     <p>You may ≈øafely make u≈øe of <hi>Opium,</hi> after the manner before mentioned; but in Gachectick &amp; infirm Bodies, who≈øoever gives it too boldly, or is fearful of pre≈øcribing it at all, di≈øcovers that he under≈øtands not its Virtue and Efficacy.</p>

                     <p>To the Forehead I have often applied the Powder of Cloves, moi≈øtened with the Spirit of Wine; for I take Vinegar to be hurtful, as are al≈øo all Emul≈øions.</p>

                        <hi>Vomiting and the Hiccough</hi> is another ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Plague.

                     <p>Another Symptom of the Plague is a <hi>great Flux</hi> which is u≈øually a ≈øign that Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth; but when the ≈øick per≈øon hath not voided meer blood, nor any thing of a bloody ≈øub≈øtance, I have ≈øometimes found the≈øe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pre≈øcriptions to be ≈øucce≈øsful.</p>

                     <p>Take Tormentil-Roots, an ounce; Red Ro≈øes, a handful; Shaving of Harts-horn a dram; Seeds of Sorrel and Mirtle, of each a dram: Boil them in Smiths water, and to nine ounces of the Liquor, add of the Confection of Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth, a dram; Syrup of Mirtles, an ounce.

                     <p>Many have al≈øo from Treacle alone received great benefit by ≈øwallowing a little of it every four hours, till they have taken the quantity

                     <p>Take Oyl of Ma≈øtick, of expre≈øt Nutmegs of each a dram; Oyl of Dill, Wormwood, Myrtles, of each two drams; old Treacle, three drams: Mix them.</p>
                     <p>Take Bolearmenick, Franckincen≈øe, Ma≈øtick, Dragons-blood, of each two drams; Mummy,

                     <p>And thus much may ≈øuffice to have been ≈øpoken concerning the inward Symptoms of the Plague; the outward are three, the <hi>Spots,</hi> call'd <hi>Petechiae,</hi> the <hi>Bubo,</hi> and the <hi>Carbuncle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spots</hi> can hardly any other way be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter removed than by inward Remedies, but they do u≈øually portend ≈øome mi≈øchief.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Bubo,</hi> I am wont to deal with after this manner following. At the fir≈øt appearance of it, and although the ≈øwelling hath arrived to no con≈øiderable height, I draw a Bli≈øter, without making u≈øe of Cupping-gla≈ø≈øes, which by rea≈øon that they cau≈øe a great deal of pain, &amp; create a Fever, &amp; draw unto them both the good &amp; bad Humors, &amp; cau≈øe a greater alteration than was before in the Blood, I do utterly lay a≈øide: After 7 or 8 hours cutting the Bli≈øter. I apply unto that part a Magnetick Plai≈øter of Ar≈øenick; the virtue whereof is ≈øo great, that I know not any more excellent; which will appear to whom≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ≈øhall make u≈øe of it; the account of it out of <hi>Hartman</hi> and <hi>Agricola,</hi> is as followeth.</p>

                        <p>When you have beat them very ≈ømall, let them be put into a Viol covered in Sand, to which you mu≈øt apply fire till they are all mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp; appear to be of a dark red colour; when
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:52336:200"/>
it is cool, it may be taken out of the Ve≈ø≈øel, and this is that which they call the <hi>Ar≈øenical Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and hath not in it any thing of Poy≈øon, as it may be ea≈øily experimented upon Dogs after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>Take <hi>Gum Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> of the Ar≈øenical Magnet, of each three drams; Turpentine of the Larch-tree, Wax, of each half an ounce; Oyl of Amber, two drams; Dulcified Earth of Vitriol, a dram.</p>
                        <p>Let the Gums be di≈ø≈øolved in the ≈øtronge≈øt Wine-Vinegar, and ≈øtrained through a Linnen Cloth, let them after that be boiled up to their former con≈øi≈øtence, then melt the Wax and the Turpentine together by them≈øelves, &amp; when you have taken them off from the fire, ≈øtir them well till you have brought them to the con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an Ointment; then add to them the Gums beforementioned, &amp; the Ar≈øenical Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, together with the Earth of Vitriol, and Oyl of Amber, &amp; you will have that plai≈øter which is mo≈øt effectual for drawing forth all ≈øorts of Poy≈øon.</p>
                        <p>I have found the virtue of this Plai≈øter to be ≈øuch, that if it be applied to tho≈øe parts where the Skin is ≈øomewhat hard, it leaves not the lea≈øt ≈øign of a Scar, and yet doth ≈øo plentifully draw forth the malignant Humor, that a <hi>Bubo</hi> of the bigne≈øs of a Walnut, will in the ≈øpace of 5 or 6 days be utterly taken away; but becau≈øe it doth not always ≈øo ≈øuddenly produce this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is often very nece≈ø≈øary to rai≈øe a Bli≈øter for evacuation of the Humors. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervable, that in ≈øome ≈øtrong Bodies it cau≈øeth no E≈øcar at all, unle≈øs when the Bli≈øter hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:52336:200"/>
not only the outward, but al≈øo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Skin. But in Children, and more tender Bodies, it will of it ≈øelf cau≈øe an E≈øcar, although there be no Bli≈øter drawn before the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                        <p>This E≈øcar or Cru≈øt is the true ≈øeat of the Venom, which is extracted, &amp; is of that thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs (e≈øpecially con≈øidering that the Skin is but ≈øuperficially corroded) that it is well worth our while to con≈øider it. For I do believe that to be the rea≈øon why it is much ≈øooner ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated than other Cru≈øts or Scars that are cau≈øed by Art; for in the ≈øpace of 24 or 36 hours, if no Scarification hath preceded, it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily taken off without any, or at lea≈øt with a very ≈ømall pain, if you make u≈øe of any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe≈øtilential Plai≈øter, and add unto it ≈øome Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or <hi>

                        <p>But if the Tumor is not ≈øufficiently abated when the fir≈øt Cru≈øt is taken off by the Ar≈øeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Magnetick Plai≈øter, it is requi≈øite that you create a ≈øecond or third, and then proceed as before.</p>
                        <p>The Ulcer may be con≈øolidated by a Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter of <hi>Minium,</hi> of White Lead, <hi>Diapompholigos,</hi> or ≈øome ≈øuch Remedy which drieth up the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and bringeth the Ulcer to a Cicatrice: But we mu≈øt ob≈øerve this by the way, that this

                        <p>Sometimes there appears one ≈øingle Bladder filled with Limpid Matter, which if it be not opened in the ≈øpace of 24 hours, it grows black, and upon its di≈ø≈øection ≈øends forth two or three drops of black Blood.</p>

                     <p>IT is the Doctrine of the Devil to teach that the u≈øe of all Means is to be neglected; who once ≈øpake to our Saviour, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to per≈øwade him to ca≈øt him≈øelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the top of the Temple, becau≈øe they need no other ≈øecurity, whom God ≈øupporteth by his mighty Hand: but he that hath given us Life and Health, requires that we ≈øhould make u≈øe of ≈øome helps for the con≈øervation of both; and therefore if you take my advice, I would wi≈øh you to ob≈øerve the Rules follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <p>Flight is very allowable to Chri≈øtians, if it be con≈øi≈øtent with their quality and condition of Life; but let tho≈øe that make u≈øe of this, not depend too much upon it, but remember that it is not po≈ø≈øible to fly beyond the reach of the Omnipotent.</p>
                     <p>And to take the≈øe Directions with them, <hi>viz.</hi> That they <hi>fly early, go far off, and be ≈ølack in their return.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we go out into the Air, either by day or night, we ought to take ≈øpecial care that it be clear and free from Vapours.</p>
                     <p>To which intent it hath been in ≈øuch ca≈øes very u≈øeful, and found exceding advantageous
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:52336:203"/>
to keep good fires both in publick an private, ≈øince the Air is by nothing ≈øooner nor more effectually purified.</p>
                     <p>It is al≈øo very nece≈ø≈øary that the Hou≈øes be daily wa≈øhed, which if it be done with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in≈øtead of Water, it is much better.</p>
                     <p>Things of a ≈øtrong Odour, ≈øuch as <hi>Amber, Musk, Civet, Benjamin,</hi> &amp;c. do not only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Malignity, but attract the Venom to them, and have been found hurtful by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and are therefore con≈øequently to be concluded ≈øo by rea≈øon.</p>
                     <p>It is u≈øele≈øs and ridiculous to anoint the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrils with <hi>Treacle</hi> and <hi>Mithredate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho≈øe things which do really purifie the Air, are <hi>Amber, Pitch, Mirrhe, Frankincen≈øe,</hi> the <hi>Wood</hi> and the <hi>Berries of Juniper, Sulphur, A≈ø≈øa Foetida, Horn</hi> (but e≈øpecially <hi>Gunpowder</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either kindled, or put upon a few lighted Coals.</p>
                     <p>Such as take Tobacco, do very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the virtue of that Plant; I do not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve the u≈øe of it, though as much as I can, I void the Smoak.</p>
                     <p>An inordinate Diet is very hurtful at all ≈øea≈øons, but e≈øpecially in a Pe≈øtilential one. There can be nothing pre≈øcribed in general which may agree with each man in particular; there is very much to be allowed to Cu≈øtom, but we mu≈øt at all times indu≈øtriou≈øly avoid all Meats that are difficult to be concocted, and take great care that the Stomach be not overcharged.</p>
                     <p>For our Diet (<hi>if we can ≈øo contrive it</hi>) we ought to make choice of Veal, Mutton,

Beef, Pullets, Capons, Peacocks, Larks, Chaffinches, Quails, Hares, Conies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Perch, Pike, Whiting, Sole, Salmon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eggs, Butter, Green and Parma Chee≈øe, Buttermilk; Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chory, Endive, Sorrel, Lettuce, Chervil, Par≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Ro≈øemary, Sharp-Apples, Quinces, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Oranges, Capers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the other ≈øide, Fle≈øh and Fi≈øh which hath been dried and ≈øalted, are very hurtful; as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and Pork, Haddocks, Eels, Crabs, Shrimps, Green Fruit, and all things that are hard of Dige≈øtion.</p>
                     <p>Walnuts are very much commended, and not without good rea≈øon; for there may be very much u≈øe made of them: The green ones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, do much good to tho≈øe that abound with Choler; but ≈øuch as are come to their full ripene≈øs, whether you take them fre≈øh gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or when they are more dried, all that make u≈øe of them, will tell you that they are very pernicious.</p>
                     <p>The ≈øtronge≈øt Beer, and Wine of a middle ≈øtrength, are very u≈øeful at ≈øuch times, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately taken; but we cannot allow that any, except ≈øuch as are very ancient, ≈øhould dayly make u≈øe of ≈øtrong and ≈øweet Wines, nor of Spirit of Wine and Brandy.</p>
                     <p>Go not forth into the Air with an empty Stomach, but always take ≈øome Pre≈øervative again≈øt Infection.</p>
                     <p>Take our Prophylactick Water, 6 ounces; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep of Ro≈øes, 3 ounces: Mix them; take the quantity of a ≈øpoonful or two each morning.</p>
                     <p>Or,</p>
                     <p>Take our Prophylactick Con≈øerve, 3 ounces;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:52336:204"/>
take the quantity of a Che≈øtnut in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or as often as you are to go to an infected place.</p>
                     <p>Vinegar, and all ≈øharp things have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by long experience; but they will not well agree with ≈øuch as are troubled with a Cough, weakne≈øs of Stomach, or the Cholick, if they are taken either alone, or in too great a quantity.</p>
                     <p>I never had any great e≈øteem for outward means, but tho≈øe that can fancy it, may wear about their Neck this Amulet.</p>
                     <p>Take Ar≈øenical Magnet, a dram; Benzoes, as much as is ≈øufficient; make them into great rowls, and ≈øew them up in red Lawn.</p>
                     <p>We have before de≈øcribed the Ar≈øenical Magnet when we treated of the Bubo.</p>
                     <p>Sleep and Watching, exerci≈øe of the Body, and the u≈øe of Women, if immoderate, are very hurtful.</p>
                     <p>Co≈øtivene≈øs is prejudicial, but not ≈øo much as a great loo≈øne≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Sadne≈øs, Fear and Anger will make very ≈øtrange alterations in the Blood; he who knows how to moderate tho≈øe Pa≈ø≈øions, is mo≈øt prudent.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Plague</hi> at that time raged very much in the next Town, which was very populous: but there had as yet appeared no Symptoms of it in this of ours: We met with no outward ≈øigns of any Malignity, nor did tho≈øe within ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ≈øo con≈øiderable, as to forbid the breathing of a Vein, which the <hi>Delirium</hi> did very much pre≈øs us upon: I therefore pre≈øcribed a Cordial Mixture, which might al≈øo be <hi>Sudorifick</hi>; whereof 2 ≈øpoonfuls was to be taken each quarter of an hour, and after the ≈øpace of one hour a Vein to be opened in the right Arm, and ≈øeven ounces of Blood to be taken from thence: I had more than once before made trial of this Mixture in a <hi>Pleuri≈øie,</hi> which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Spots: The De≈øcription of it is as followeth.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>FOra≈ømuch as it hath been thought convenient by ≈øeveral good Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, to contrive a ≈øafe way of <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> for the benefit of young Beginners in that Profe≈ø≈øion; and whereas Dr. <hi>LOWER</hi> of late, in his Treati≈øe of the <hi>Heart,</hi> hath di≈øcovered a plain and ≈øecure way of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> and given a figure of the <hi>Lancet,</hi> which he commends for that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52336:223"/>
purpo≈øe, I have been advi≈øed, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, to tran≈ølate what he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and likewi≈øe give the figure of the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet,</hi> and de≈øcription of the U≈øe of it, as it is printed in the <hi>166</hi> page of the la≈øt and true≈øt Edition of his Book, Printed at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterdam 1671.</hi> in the Author's own words.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HOw great Ebullition ≈øometimes happens in the Blood, in what ve≈ø≈øels, and with what ≈øwift motion it is ca≈øt about every where through the Body, and if an Artery be opened how quickly, and with what force it breaks out, it hath been hitherto treated of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Di≈øcour≈øe; by which it appears, how nece≈ø≈øary ≈øometimes <hi>Blood-letting</hi> is, to dimini≈øh its Quantity, or to ≈øtop its Career, and how dangerous the Admini≈øtration of it is, if it be performed by a rude and unskilful hand.</p>
                  <p>For it often happening, either by want of skill, or common practice of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> (which makes the Mind fearful, and con≈øequently the Hand trembling and uncertain) that an <hi>Artery</hi> is opened, or a <hi>Nerve</hi> or <hi>Tendon</hi> cut or prick'd, whence follows Swellings, Pains, Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Gangrenes or Convul≈øions, which put the member in danger of being cut off, or render'd u≈øele≈øs, I thought it might not be beyond the ≈øcope of my Treati≈øe, if, by way of <hi>Appendix,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52336:223"/>
I ≈øhould ≈øhew by what means and In≈øtrument any Vein might be ≈øafely and ≈øecurely opened, (if it ≈øwell upon a Ligature (though it have an Artery, Nerve or Tendon immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p>Fora≈ømuch therefore as never any harm happens in <hi>Blood-letting,</hi> unle≈øs a Vein be prick'd through or ≈ølipping a≈øide, the <hi>Lancet</hi> be put too deep into the part, the Fabrick of this <hi>Lancet</hi> is ≈øuch, and ought to be ≈øo put into the Vein, as both may be ea≈øily prevented.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Lancet</hi> is ≈øo contrived, that it is not cutting on each ≈øide, unle≈øs it be near the point, but is purpo≈øely blunt, and made round on the lower ≈øide, which is to be applied next to the skin, that it may more ea≈øily ≈ølide over it, as it appears by the following Table, in which.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>a</hi> the <hi>Lancet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>b</hi> the place where the upper edge of the <hi>Lancet</hi> ends in a plain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>c</hi> where the under edge of the <hi>Lancet</hi> ends, the re≈øt of the under part being poli≈øh'd round, and thick, (but not made thicker than the upper plain part) that it may not grate or tear the skin (upon which it mu≈øt be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) by its compre≈ø≈øion.</p>
                  <p>Which figure of the <hi>Lancet</hi> differs nothing from a common ordinary <hi>Lancet,</hi> but that the under edge of it is blunted almo≈øt to the point.</p>
                  <p>The way of u≈øing it is only this, that the Member being tied, and the Vein ≈øwelling, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52336:224"/>
                     <hi>Lancet</hi> mu≈øt be applied as near to it as po≈ø≈øible, but ≈øo that the <hi>Lancet</hi> may be depre≈øs'd as much as may be; then the Point of it being directed upwards, it mu≈øt be gently, and by an oblique tran≈øver≈øe Inci≈øion be put into the Vein: which if ≈øo directed, neither can the Vein avoid the point of the <hi>Lancet,</hi> or the parts underneath be any way offended. Which way of <hi>Blooding,</hi> as it is mo≈øt ea≈øie, ≈øo it will never prove unhappy to any one, though but meanly skilful.</p>
                  <p>And though I do not write this to <hi>Phy≈øicians</hi> and <hi>Chirurgeons,</hi> who are expert and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerci≈øed in bleeding; yet having ≈øeen many peoples health and life endangered, either by ill Blood-letting, or becau≈øe a good <hi>Chirurgeon</hi> could not timely be called in by <hi>Phy≈øicians,</hi> who mo≈øt commonly forbear the Practice of it, therefore I have devi≈øed this figure of a <hi>Lancet,</hi> that they may more ≈øecurely and confidently u≈øe it.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52336:225"/>
≈øupplied with what they needed for their healths; and al≈øo that the Medicines that were wanting or decayed, might be forthwith renewed: an evident ≈øign, and great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration of the Piety, Prudence, and Care of this <hi>Prince</hi> towards his Souldiers. This <hi>Che≈øt,</hi> as often as nece≈ø≈øity required march'd with the Camp, and in the greate≈øt and mo≈øt dangerous occa≈øions the Souldiers were for the pre≈øent ≈øuccoured, and a≈ø≈øi≈øted from it. Then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were carried to the next Cities, where they were taken care of by Phy≈øicians and Chirurgeons, appointed and paid by the <hi>States</hi>: and if by chance any Souldier lo≈øt a Limb, or was lame, he was relieved, and had an Annual Pen≈øion from the <hi>States.</hi> This Pious and Chri≈øtian Con≈øtitution made the Souldiers de≈øpi≈øe all dangers, and incouraged them to be both valiant and daring.</p>
                  <p>Therefore that <hi>Generals</hi> may under≈øtand what things are mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary to furni≈øh a <hi>Che≈øt</hi> with, I thought good to ≈øet down both the principal Medicaments, and In≈øtruments, that a Chirurgeon, following the Camp or Sea, ought to be provided with; and if there ≈øhould be occa≈øion for any others, he may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh him≈øelf at the next Shop he comes at.</p>

But e≈øpecially keep thy Head and Feet warm, by the neglect of which thou mai≈øt ca≈øt thy ≈øelf into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Take heed of ≈øurcharging the ≈øtomach, which is to prepare and to convey the nouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52336:234"/>
for the whole body, and re≈øtrain as much as thou can≈øt thy appetite, there being nothing more hurtful to health, than when that is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and extravagant.</p>
                     <p>Gird thy ≈øelf well, that thy body may be clo≈øe, and ≈øo be ≈øecured from receiving mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in leaping, falling, ≈øtorming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thy bowels from being put out of their place.</p>
                     <p>Take al≈øo with thee out of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's ≈øhop a powder, called <hi>Pulvis ≈øolutivus de Tribus,</hi> which is not dear.

                     <p>It hath been pre≈øcribed above, to take with thee the Herbs <hi>Imperatoria</hi> and <hi>Carlina.</hi> Of this be mindful; for if it ≈øhould happen, that thou ≈øhould≈øt be obliged to ≈øtand ≈øome hours in battel or in the field, take a piece of it in thy mouth for hunger, thir≈øt, and refre≈øhment,

wa≈øhing thy mouth with it, as al≈øo ≈øpirting a little of it into thy hor≈øes mouth. Be≈øides ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with water, it will afford thee a good cooling drink.</p>
                     <p>If it he very cold, put ≈øome of that hor≈øe-hair, that is wont to be curried out of their mains and tails, into thy Boots.

                     <p>Be≈øides, ob≈øerve the <hi>Air,</hi> and put up thy Tent towards the Ea≈øt; which quarter though it be cool, yet 'tis whol≈øom.

                     <p>Moreover, look about thee for good clear <hi>Water,</hi> ≈øuch as grows warm and cool again ≈øooner than other waters; and ob≈øerve this mark for my ≈øake.

                     <p>But if thou can≈øt not have Spring-water, but art nece≈ø≈øitated to u≈øe Pit or Ditch-water; have a care not to drink it without ≈øtraining, lea≈øt thou ≈øhould≈øt ≈øwallow Frog or Snake-≈øpawn. For I have known and had in my cure a Countrey-man, who voided, though not at once but at different times, two hundred fifty and five Frogs, and of them many in my own hou≈øe, in the pre≈øence of divers Eccle≈øia≈øtical and Secular Per≈øons; and ≈øome of the bigge≈øt of them, being dried, are ≈øtill to be ≈øeen in the Repo≈øitoy of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as al≈øo in that of Mr. <hi>Philip Hainhofer</hi> at <hi>Au≈øpurg.</hi> And there is a Cook in the Ho≈øpital of <hi>We≈ø≈øenburg</hi> or <hi>Landsberg,</hi> who, (as appeared by the event) had drunk the Spawn of Serpents, out of which were bred divers Serpents in his Body, ≈øome of which he voided by vertue of the Medicine he took, among≈øt which there was one of the length of a <hi>Bavarian</hi> Ell. The Man hath been ≈øince in good health, and continues in his ≈øervice to this day.</p>

Or, if you lye ≈øtill, and can get any Oyl of Vitriol, let ≈øome drops of that fall into it, and you need not then fear any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or poy≈øon in ≈øuch water. Otherwi≈øe, if time will permit, let it boil up and cool again, and put a cru≈øt of bread into it, and you may drink of it ≈øafely.</p>
                     <p>Tho≈øe Waters that run out of ≈øtony hills and from under rocks, are the be≈øt; to which may be reckon'd tho≈øe Springs, that flow from high places, and purge them≈øelves in clear ≈øand and pebles.</p>

                     <p>If you chance to drink whil≈øt you are hot, (which is ≈øo dangerous a thing that ≈øome have dyed within 24 hours after it; others have fallen into con≈øumptive Coughs, others been

But this mu≈øt be u≈øed pre≈øently, the ≈øooner the better. I can ≈øay with truth, that in all my Practice of Phy≈øick for above 20 years I have not met with any Experiment of ≈øo quick an Operation from any herb, as from this.

                     <p>But to proceed; as thou art to beware of exce≈øs of drinking at all times, ≈øo thou art e≈øpecially to forbear when thou art to ≈øtand Sentinel, le≈øt thou ≈øhould fall a ≈øleep; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou may≈øt lo≈øe thy life, at lea≈øt, thy place and thy preferment for ever.</p>

                     <p>EVery Army ought to be well provided with one or more able Phy≈øicians, ≈øuch as are not only expert in the cure of inward Di≈øea≈øes, but al≈øo under≈øtanding in outward Ca≈øes, as Wounds, Burnings, Luxations. Di≈ølocations, <hi>Ery≈øipelas's</hi> or St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Fires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The≈øe Phy≈øicians ought to be no Young≈øters, that are lately come from Schools and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øities, knowing only in Controver≈øies and Di≈øputations, but ≈øuch as are expert in the Cure of Di≈øea≈øes, e≈øpecially ≈øuch as are mo≈øt frequent in Armies. They are al≈øo to be Men of good nature, great hone≈øty and conde≈øcen≈øion, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take pains with the poor as well as the rich. Phy≈øicians thus qualified may ≈øo gain the hearts of the Souldiers, that the≈øe will love and honour them as if they were their Parents.</p>
                     <p>Likewi≈øe the Chirurgeons ought to be learn'd, di≈øcreet, and affable, ≈øuch as have been long vers'd, and experienc'd, in all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chirurgery, that can di≈øtingui≈øh well of Di≈øea≈øes, and with prudence make their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereon: They ought al≈øo to be diligent, and careful of tho≈øe committed to their charge,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52336:238"/>
and very knowing in all manner of outward applications, as Unguents, Plai≈øters, Pulments, Lenitives, Stiptiques, Attractives, Dige≈øtives, Cau≈øticks, E≈øcharotiques, as al≈øo their Molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, Di≈ø≈øipating, Repelling, Suppurating and Mundifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Medicines.

                     <p>An able and dextrous Chirurgeon is a great Trea≈øure in an Army, and cannot be enough valued, e≈øpecially if he con≈øult in all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ca≈øes with an under≈øtanding Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe two, Phy≈øitians and Chirurgeons, are to be intimate friends together, a≈ø≈øi≈øting one another without envy and pride, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter relief and the greater ≈øafety of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very nece≈ø≈øary, both the≈øe ≈øhould go abroad and travel before they undertake to practi≈øe, thereby to acquire experience, and to learn al≈øo to conver≈øe with the more di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and gentlene≈øs with all ≈øorts of humors.

                     <p>'TIs known ≈øeldom to fail, that in an army there reigneth ≈øome Di≈øea≈øe or other, according to the nature and con≈øtitution of the Country, Air, and Diet. The rea≈øons are;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> that among≈øt ≈øo great a number of Men, rai≈øed from ≈øo many different places, there are to be found Men of very different tempers and con≈øtitutions, ≈øound and un≈øound; and among≈øt the latter, ≈øome that are ≈øcabby, others ≈øcorbutical, others labouring under venereal Di≈øea≈øes, many inclined to dangerous and infectious Fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitian mu≈øt have a watchful eye upon, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent their ≈øpreading.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> that Souldiers in an Army want conveniences wherewith to take due care of their health; but are often con≈øtrain'd to expo≈øe them≈øelves and ≈øleep in the open Air
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52336:239"/>
on moi≈øt ground, the vapours whereof pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into their bodies; and they are carele≈øs or want oppertunities of expelling them out again by ≈øweat. Whence is cau≈øed an inward putrefaction in the blood and humours, which ≈øometimes proceeds ≈øo far, as to a≈ø≈øume a venemous nature, and to break out into ≈øpots, tumors, bubo's, carbuncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that Souldiers commonly keep an irregular diet. Sometimes they have plenty and do ≈øupperabound; at other times they have nothing; and then being very hungry, when they come again to a place of plenty, they over-feed and ≈øurfeit; whence are bred crudities in the Stomach, and corruption, which cau≈øeth malignant Fevers in abundance. Be≈øides, they often feed upon Meat that is unwhol≈øom, as ≈øtinking Veni≈øon, rotten Chee≈øe mu≈øty Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cannot but occa≈øion many Di≈øea≈øes. And when they come to places, where Fruit abounds, as Apples, Pears, Plums, Melons, Cherries, Grapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they over-eat them≈øelves, and thereby cau≈øe Gripings in the Guts, <hi>Diarrhaea's, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>La≈øtly,</hi> ≈øometimes the Air is corrupted, e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially after a great Battel, and ≈ølaughter of Men that remain unburied; whereby the Air being tainted infects the living that take it in. Which is often made wor≈øe by the exhalations of low and moori≈øh ground, and by thick Fogs.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe are the general Cau≈øes of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Di≈øtempers reigning in Armies; again≈øt which thou art to arm thy ≈øelf accordingly. Fir≈øt then be careful in thy Diet; eat not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52336:240"/>
greedily and indi≈øcreetly every thing that comes to hand; and though it be good, yet eat and drink not too plentifully of it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrain thy appetite, con≈øidering how de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive every exce≈øs may be to thy health.</p>
                     <p>If thou can≈øt and ha≈øt no aver≈øion from it, drink every Morning of thy own <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>rine,</hi> which prevents corruption in the Stomach, opens ob≈øtructions in the Liver, Spleen, Me≈øaraic Veins; which if not removed, there will follow Fevers, the Yellow Jaundice, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and difficulty of breathing. If thou art aver≈øe from doing ≈øo, eat ≈øome Bread and Butter with Rue on it; or, if it be not hot weather, take in the morning the quantity of a Ha≈øel-nut of Mithridate or Treacle; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe in Brandy, or rather in Spirit of <hi>Juniper-berries,</hi> ≈øome <hi>Zedoary, Angelica,</hi> and a little <hi>Citron-peels,</hi> and drink a ≈øpoonful of it in the Morning.</p>
                     <p>When the Air is corrupted, and there be at hand a Goat, rub thy ≈øelf at him, and let not the ≈øtrong ≈ømell keep thee from it. Al≈øo put Quick≈øilver in an empty Ha≈øel-nut, clo≈øed up with <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Wax, and hang it about thy neck; or the <hi>Zenechton</hi> prepared of <hi>Ar≈øenic,</hi> (after the manner by and by to be de≈øcribed) ≈øowed up in thin Leather; for if it ≈øhould touch the bare skin, it would cau≈øe Bli≈øters and do harm. This <hi>Zenechton</hi> is a Plai≈øter, out of which are cut pieces of the bigne≈øs of a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which are carried about the Neck, and hang down near the Heart; keeping good a whole year. And when the infection is pa≈øt, this <hi>Zenechton</hi> being reduced to Powder, will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52336:240"/>
yet ≈øerve to kill Rats and Mice with. It is to be thus prepar'd,</p>
                     <p>Take of Yellow and White Ar≈øenic, of each an ounce, or ¬æ of an ounce; of <hi>gummi Tragacanth</hi> ¬Ω an ounce; put this <hi>gummi</hi> in Ro≈øe-water or in common water over night, and it will yield a ≈ølimy Water. Then beat thy Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenic in a Mortar, and put ≈øo much of this gummed Water to it, as is nece≈ø≈øary to reduce it to a Pa≈øte having the con≈øi≈øtence of Dough; work it well and round it, and then cut off a ≈ølice of the bigne≈øs of a Dollar, ≈øomewhat thicker; let this ≈ølice dry in the Air, and ≈øow it in a piece of thin Leather (well-dre≈ø≈øed Dogs-skin is the be≈øt for this purpo≈øe;) carry this about thy Neck ≈øo as to let it hang down upon, and to touch the place of thy Heart. Some mix with it a proportion of the Powder of dried Toads, which I have done my ≈øelf, it being e≈øteem'd more powerful. Some carry about their Necks dried Spiders; <hi>Theophra≈øtus</hi> commends <hi>Celondine,</hi> Leaves and Root, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about the Neck.</p>
                     <p>Remember al≈øo to burn frequently <hi>Juniper-wood</hi> before thy Tent; though all ordinary fires clean≈øe the Air: Upon which account <hi>Hippocrates</hi> advi≈øed great fires to be made in <hi>Greece</hi> at the time of a great Plague, which was thought to have been remov'd by that means. Some burn only a few Chips of Juniper-roots, or ≈øome of the Berries of that ≈øhrub, which is as effectual.</p>
                     <p>If the≈øe means cannot be had, burn ≈øome Gunpowder, ordering it like a Train; this purifieth the Air likewi≈øe. And the volleys
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52336:241"/>
of ≈øhot made mornings and evenings in a Camp, conduce very much to the di≈øpelling of Mi≈øt, and qualifying raw weather.</p>
                     <p>Frankincen≈øe al≈øo, Ma≈øtick, and ≈øuch other Perfumes as dry and clear the Air, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry u≈øefully burnt; and even a Scholars Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume made of wa≈øte <hi>Paper</hi> is not to be de≈øpi≈øed.</p>
                     <p>If thou can≈øt get <hi>Rue,</hi> ≈ømell often to it: And remember me for this general hint, to take good notice of all Herbs that are green Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Summer, and which are not eaten by Hor≈øes or Cattel; for they are endow'd with excellent virtues for the good of <hi>Man,</hi> and therefore made to grow at all ≈øea≈øons of the year.</p>
                     <p>When the Air is pe≈øtilential, or breeding any Epidemical Di≈øea≈øe, then wa≈øh thy face with Vinegar every morning. If thou can≈øt get <hi>Acetum</hi> of Rue, Elder-flowers, Lavender, Ro≈øes, Marigold-flowers, 'tis the better. Or, if you have the conveniency, prepare the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Acetum</hi>: Take Rue, Elder-flowers, Burnet-roots, white Dittany, Carlina, of each equal quantity; a few Orange or Citron-peels, (of which the latter are the better of the two,) and a little Camphire, and ≈øome Walnut-kernels (the fre≈øher the better,) leaving the bitter skins upon them; put all the≈øe into common Vinegar, and with this infu≈øion moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øten every morning thy Temples, Mouth and No≈øtrils, and the beating Arteries of both thy Wri≈øts; taking down a good ≈øpoonful of it, and thou ha≈øt a good pre≈øervative.</p>
                     <p>If it be cold weather, take Angelica-roots, Zedoaria, white Dittany, ≈øome dried Citron-peels,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52336:241"/>
and a little Camphir, infu≈øe them all in Brandy, e≈øpecially in ≈øuch as is made out of Wormwood or Juniper-berries. Of this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor drink in the morning a ≈øpoonful. But if thou be of a hot con≈øtitution, then content thy ≈øelf with the former <hi>Acetum,</hi> in which you may mix a little Treacle.</p>
                     <p>Some advi≈øe to take fa≈øting ≈øome of the Juice of Marigold, fre≈øhly expre≈øs'd out of the Flower and Leaves, as a good pre≈øervative again≈øt the Infection. This I have not tried; but I have often in ≈øuch ca≈øes u≈øed the <hi>Acetum</hi> of Marigold-flowers, e≈øpecially for a Cordial and Sudorifick, and, I think, with very good ≈øucce≈øs.</p>
                     <p>Or make an Electuary of Rue and Juniper-berries, of each equal quantity, adding thereto a double quantity of Walnuts, with their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter skin on them, ≈øome Figs, a little Treacle, and a little Saffron; beat them together in a Mortar, and pour on them, whil≈øt thou art beating, as much Rue-vinegar as will reduce it to a thick Puls or Electuary: Of this take the bigne≈øs of a Ha≈øel-Nut or two, fa≈øting.</p>
                     <p>Take the Roots of the greater <hi>Burrdock,</hi> and tho≈øe of <hi>Celondine,</hi> both well cleared, and the Bark of A≈øh; infu≈øe them twenty four hours in half White-wine, and half Rue-vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; then di≈øtil it, and in the di≈øtilled water mix a little Brim≈øtone-oyl, to render it a little ≈øowri≈øh. Of this take two ≈øpoonfuls in the morning for a pre≈øervative. But if any be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready infected with the Plague, let him take of the ≈øame ≈øix or eight ≈øpoonfuls at a time, and ≈øweat upon it, it being a very ≈øudorifick
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52336:242"/>
Liquor, which, under the name of <hi>Aqua Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dana compo≈øita,</hi> hath been u≈øed by me and my Collegues in Ho≈øpitals and other places with very great ≈øucce≈øs. You may mix ≈øome Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date with it, if you plea≈øe.</p>
                     <p>El≈øe take <hi>Carlina, Imperatoria, Serpentaria, Valerian, Saxifrage, Tormentil, Gentian, Angelica</hi> and <hi>Zedoaria,</hi> all cut ≈ømall; infu≈øe them in Brandy, and drink of it a ≈øpoonful in the morning for a pre≈øervative; but if thou ha≈øt the Contagion, take <hi>two</hi> ≈øpoonfuls, to ≈øweat upon it, in ca≈øe the Pe≈øtilential Poi≈øon be not yet broken out, and the Patients Tongue not dry; but if it be, content thy ≈øelf with the newly pre≈øcribed <hi>Acetum,</hi> as being more ≈øafe, and an Inflammation being to be feared from the Brandy.</p>
                     <p>Hold <hi>Zedoar, Angelica, Lovage</hi> or <hi>Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> in thy mouth; but if thou be ≈øubject to the Head-ach, then cut it fir≈øt ≈ømall, and infu≈øe it in Vinegar, and let it ≈øtand infu≈øed for the ≈øpace of 24 hours; then take it out again, dry it, and u≈øe it as pre≈øcribed above.</p>
                     <p>Among≈øt the good <hi>Pre≈øervatives</hi> reckon this al≈øo: Take <hi>Garden-rue,</hi> beat it into a mortar, pour Vinegar on it, and ≈øtrain all through a cloth; mix ≈øome Treacle with it, ≈øet it by in a gla≈øs, and take of it in the morning half a ≈øpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or a whole. Put a little Camphir to it, if you will have it ≈øtronger.</p>
                     <p>Or put Camphir in Worm-wood-wine, and drink a good draught of it every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</p>
                     <p>When I ≈øerved in times of great mortality, I infu≈øed in Wine <hi>Carduus benedictus, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,

Take of it the weight of about two ducats in common Vinegar, or in Elder-water, or rather in the expre≈ø≈øed Juyce of fre≈øh Sorrel, and ≈øweat upon it. 'Tis very good e≈øpecially in the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Sickne≈øs and other venomous and infectious Di≈øea≈øes. To young People you may give a le≈ø≈øer quantity, and proportionably you are to le≈ø≈øen the Do≈øe for Women with Child or in Child bed, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides take notice of the Powder of Doctor <hi>He≈ø≈øius,</hi> which hath been u≈øed with great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and is thus prepared.</p>
                     <p>Take a drachm of Sugar-candy, a quarter of an ounce of pulveri≈øed Ginger, and a drachm of Camphir; reduce all to a fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; give of it to the infected Patient the weight of a drachm in Vinegar mingled with the Water of Marigold flowers, Scabious or Sorrel, and ≈øweat upon it. If you have none of the≈øe Waters, then look that the Vinegar be not too ≈øharp, and to that end dilute it with ≈øome Wine and Water. Mean time, though in this ca≈øe I highly value Camphir, yet in ≈øtead of Ginger I would u≈øe Zedoary, Saxifrage, Carlina or Imperatoria, or the true <hi>Peta≈øites</hi> or Butter-burr.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Brim≈øtone</hi> is none of the meane≈øt Remedies in the≈øe infectious ca≈øes; for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerves

the Body from Putrefaction. Wherefore take of the noble Flowers of Sulphur a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ounce, being ≈øublimed from Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar; add to it one ≈øcruple of Camphir, an ounce of the Spirit or Oyl of Cyprian or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Turpentine. Put all this into a Gla≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, lute it well and put it upon hot Sand or A≈øhes, whereby the Oyl of Turpentine will come to open the Brim≈øtone, and produce a red colour like a Ruby, or at lea≈øt as yellow as a high-colour'd Hyacinth. Of this give ≈øome to the Patient three or four times, mingled with a little Treacle, or in Sorrel, Cardobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus, or Scabious-water. This Bal≈øom is excellent al≈øo in ≈øore Brea≈øts that are growing purulent, taken in warm broth, or in a good Wound-drink. But this mu≈øt be in ca≈øes of no great heat or inflammation, in which it would be dangerous.</p>
                     <p>Among≈øt all the Remedies, which ≈øerve again≈øt Infectious Di≈øea≈øes, that of <hi>Henricus Stapedius,</hi> to be found in my Book <hi>de Pe≈øtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> is an excellent one, and perhaps the be≈øt for curing as well as pre≈øerving; of which half a ≈øpoonful being taken fa≈øting, is able to keep a Man well for twelve hours or more: But if any be already infected, he mu≈øt take of it at any time immediately, to the quantity of a ≈øpoonful and an half, or two ≈øpoonfuls, for ≈øweating. Which is to be repeated every eighteen or twenty four hours, to make the Patient ≈øweat, till he recover, or till the Pe≈øtilential Boyls and Carbuncles break out behind the Ears, under the Arms, or el≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. This Water, though it be ≈øomewhat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52336:257"/>
dear, yet its vertue countervails its price. The older it grows the more vertue it hath.</p>
                     <p>Many have a≈øcribed great efficacy to the Blood of Animals: Thus old <hi>Democritus,</hi> (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs <hi>Galen,</hi>) prepared an Electuary of ≈øuch Blood, called <hi>Diathaemat√¥n.</hi> Some e≈øteem much the Blood of <hi>Storks,</hi> becau≈øe they eat Toads and Snakes; others value the Blood of Hens, becau≈øe they eat Spiders and other venomous In≈øects. I ≈øhould e≈øteem mo≈øt the Fle≈øh or Blood of Badgers; which is to be dried in the ≈øhade, and that done, you mu≈øt mix with it Saffron, Camphir, and ≈øome or other of the Anti-pe≈øtilential Roots, as of Angelica, Zedoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, or the like, together with a little live Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone to the quantity of a ducat; which is to be taken in <hi>Acetuni</hi> of Rue, or Marigold-flowers, or Walnuts, and in ca≈øe of want of the≈øe, in common Vinegar: Upon which the Patient is to ≈øweat. If thou art a good Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, have ready a good <hi>Acetum</hi> of Rue, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-kernels and Marigold-flowers, taking the greater quantity of Rue; and as you u≈øe it, fill it up again with <hi>Acetum</hi> of Elder-berries.</p>
                     <p>The Rich do u≈øe for their Phy≈øick in the time of the Plague, the red Hungarian, as al≈øo the Imperial red and gray Powder, Bezoar, Harts-horn, <hi>Antidotum Matthioli, Terra Sigilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Bole Armeniack, Scorzonera</hi> and <hi>Contrayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, Species de Gemmis, Diamargariton de Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cintho,</hi> and other high Medicines, of which I have largely di≈øcour≈øed in my above-cited Book <hi>De Po≈øtilentia.</hi> But I, though I have u≈øed ≈øuch Remedies among the Rich, yet I content my ≈øelf commonly with the plainer
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52336:257"/>
and mo≈øt common Medicines, of which I have more knowledge and experience.</p>
                     <p>The Pickle of <hi>Ebulus</hi> or Walwort, (<hi>alias</hi> Dane-wort, or Dwarf-elder,) which is of kin to Elder; as al≈øo the Pickle of Juniper-berries, are al≈øo of great u≈øe in this ca≈øe.</p>
                     <p>The Phy≈øicians of <hi>Ausburg</hi> made great u≈øe, in the year 1572. of the red Imperial Powder; the compo≈øition of which is in the <hi>Augu≈øtan Di≈øpen≈øatory</hi> at large, as al≈øo in my Book <hi>de Pe≈øte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The≈øe are the ≈øeveral means to provoke ≈øweat, which I e≈øteem to be of great efficacy for that purpo≈øe upon a ≈øudden. And though Souldiers have not the conveniency of a Bed for ≈øweating, when they are in a march, and often cannot put off their Cloaths for many nights together; yet let them u≈øe ≈øuch ≈øudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick means: for, though they cannot ≈øweat outright, yet they may fall into a dampi≈øh moi≈øture, which if it ≈øtrike not in again, may prove as good as a ≈øweat. Yet in this ca≈øe he mu≈øt turn his Shirt: <hi>Quod non facit ≈øudor, prae≈øtat id tenuis udor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here is to be noted, that 'tis not enough, once only to give a ≈øudorifick Medicine to an infected Body; con≈øidering that the venom, like a raging Sea, is to≈ø≈øed to and fro every way. And though it ≈øhould ≈øeem to thee, as if by thy approved Antidote thou had≈øt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Di≈øea≈øe, the ≈øymptoms of it excepted, yet thou art not to tru≈øt in this ca≈øe; for I my ≈øelf have been ≈øometimes deceived, and hard put to it to make good what by confidence I had omitted. Wherefore you mu≈øt not tru≈øt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52336:258"/>
to the <hi>once</hi> taking a ≈øudorifick Potion or Powder, becau≈øe ≈øuch malign and lurking Di≈øea≈øes, that keep no ≈øtitch, do indeed fly the fir≈øt time from thy Medicament, and hide them≈øelves under it, but they are wont ≈øudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to re-appear. Wherefore you mu≈øt repeat the Antidotes, that were fir≈øt admini≈øtred to you, for the time of 16, 18, 20, or 24 hours, according to circum≈øtances, and ≈øo long and often, till you judge your ≈øick Brothers or Friends Heart ≈øecured from the infectious Venom.</p>
                     <p>When the ≈øweating is over, thou mu≈øt then refre≈øh thy Patient, fir≈øt by drying him well, and next by giving him a little Vinegar to ta≈øte in a ≈øpoon. The Rich may afford ≈øome ≈ølices of Citron, of which <hi>Theopompus Chius</hi> writeth, that the Tyrant <hi>Clearchus Heracleota,</hi> who lived in <hi>Pontus,</hi> having poi≈øoned many People, the vertue of Citron was at length found out, of which a ≈ølice being eaten pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an effectual Antidote again≈øt it. The ≈øame vertue may be found in a ≈ølice of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Apple; and the <hi>Syrupus de Pomis</hi> is one of the Cordials of our ≈øhops.</p>
                     <p>But the thir≈øt, that u≈øes to follow upon ≈øweating, will not be quenched with ≈øo ≈ømall a matter; wherefore take three parts of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, one part of Vinegar, and, if the Patient be not too hot, one part of Wine, mixing ≈øome Sugar therewith, and of this let him drink a good draught, and it will cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre≈øh him.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides, take ≈øome of the guts of Hens, and ≈øome ≈ølices of Radi≈øh, ≈øprinkle them with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52336:258"/>
Vinegar and Salt, and bind them to the ≈øoles of his feet; this will draw away the heat. But let not the Radi≈øh lye too long upon them, becau≈øe it will give a ≈øtink that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe the head-ach, wherewith the People that have the Plague are commonly troubled enough without provoking it. Moreover you will do well to tye about his wri≈øts ≈øome Rue beaten with Vinegar. Anoint his Loyns and Back-bone with the Unguent of Ro≈øes, or with fre≈øh Butter; but if there appear any Spots, forbear to anoint him, le≈øt they ≈øhould be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in.</p>
                     <p>You will do well to have <hi>Epithemata</hi> of good things about you, as of Ro≈øe water and Elder-vinegar, to lay over the Heart; with which mix ≈øome Camphir. But if you find any thing of Specks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> broke out, you mu≈øt u≈øe no wet thing.</p>
                     <p>Anoint his Heart with Oyl of Scorpions, take the Oyl of Sea-blo≈ø≈øoms and of tho≈øe Earth-worms that appear after rain, of each ≈øix ounces, of St <hi>Johns</hi>-wort Oyl two ounces, of fre≈øh Elder-blo≈ø≈øoms and Rue, each a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and an half, of the <hi>Acetum,</hi> of Marigold-flowers and Ro≈øes, each about three ounces, of live Spiders forty five: Boil all the≈øe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till the Vinegar be ≈øo qualified, that when 'tis thrown into the fire, it cau≈øe no cracking there. Then ≈øtrain it, and in this ≈øtrained Oyl put a matter of five and twenty Spiders more, of the bigge≈øt ≈øort, and add to it of Camphir di≈ø≈øolved in the Spirit of Ro≈øes half a drachm; let it ≈øtand in <hi>Balneo Mariae</hi> or upon hot embers for twelve hours, and then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52336:259"/>
put to it of Treacle and Mithridate, of each half an ounce, and let them work together. With this Oyl anoint the eight Pul≈øes, <hi>viz.</hi> both Temples, behind both Ears, both Hands, and both Knees, as al≈øo the Heart. And this is an excellent <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to Scorpion-oyl, much u≈øed by the <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Be≈øides, you mu≈øt refre≈øh and ≈øtrengthen the Patient with convenient Meat and Drink; I mean with good Fle≈øh or Barley-broath, with a little Vinegar in it to make it ≈øavoury to him who will have appetite to little el≈øe, till he have ≈øhaken off this venomous Di≈øtemper; which when he hath done, his ≈øtomach will be ≈øo keen, that you will find work enough to keep him from ≈øurfeiting.</p>
                     <p>Be al≈øo careful to keep thy Patients Body open; if he be ob≈øtructed, u≈øe a Cli≈øter, or take Butter or Hogs-grea≈øe, mixing a little Salt with it, or, if it be to be gotten, a little Mice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trickles, and put it into his bowels. Phy≈øick at the mouth for this purpo≈øe is not always ≈øafe: When the Patient is di≈øcharged of the venom, a little liquor of ≈øtew'd Prunes with ≈øome Senna-leaves in it will do well for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body. Some fre≈øh Butter eaten in the morning, or melted in warm Broath, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, is wont al≈øo to keep the body ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble.</p>
                     <p>The Drink of the≈øe Patients may be, Water with ≈øome Bread ≈øoaked in it; or take of ≈øuch Water, wherein Bread hath been ≈øoaked, one quart, and a little Vinegar, with two or three ≈øpoonfuls of Kitchin-≈øugar, mingling it well together. If you have no Sugar, u≈øe ≈øuch Water
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52336:259"/>
with Vinegar alone: This affords good Drink in malignant Fevers. Among the <hi>Romans</hi> it was drunk by the Souldiers, under the name of <hi>Po≈øca.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may al≈øo take a handful of well cleaned Plantain-roots, and boil them up in three quarts of Water, and then decant the Water, which though it be ≈øomewhat bitter, yet 'tis very good in Fevers, and a good Drink in hot Di≈øtempers.</p>
                     <p>If you have Oyl of Vitriol, let a few drops of it fall into clear Water, mingling it well; and you will have a factitious <hi>Sawer-brun</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidula.</hi> But u≈øe no Metalline Ve≈ø≈øel for this purpo≈øe. With this kind of Water many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have been ≈øerved in all ≈øorts of Fevers; the Oyl of Vitriol, in ≈øuch Di≈øtempers, if rightly u≈øed, being very beneficial.</p>
                     <p>But if a Man ≈øhould have with it any Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Di≈øea≈øe, in that ca≈øe he mu≈øt forbear acid things, and u≈øe Liquorice, and content him≈øelf with Pti≈øane. Nor is it at all good to u≈øe acids in Pe≈øtilential Pleuri≈øies.</p>
                     <p>And ≈øince on this occa≈øion we mention this ca≈øe, and we having above given warning, not ea≈øily to blood in Pe≈øtilential Di≈øea≈øes; yet may Venae-≈øection be ≈øometimes, upon good con≈øideration, u≈øed in that <hi>Pleuri≈øie,</hi> provided it be done in the very beginning, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be ≈øtrong and full of Blood. Yet this is not to le≈ø≈øen the blood, but only to give it vent; but before bleeding the Patient is to ≈øweat by taking ≈øome of the above ≈øpecified Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes.</p>
                     <p>If the Patient have violent Head-ach, lay on his head Vine-leaves or fre≈øh Cabbage-leaves;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52336:260"/>
and, if you have no Alabla≈øter-≈øalve, take two parts of Vinegar, and one part of Oyl of Olives (the Sea-blo≈ø≈øoms Oyl, and Elder-Vinegar were better;) dip long rags of linnen therein, and having well ≈øqueez'd them again, lay them lukewarm over the face and temples. Even Vinegar alone is good. Of ≈øuch Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you may make many, of <hi>Acetum</hi> of Ro≈øes, Elder-blo≈ø≈øoms, and the like, with a little Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir. The expre≈ø≈øed Milk of Peaches is al≈øo very effectual in this ca≈øe.</p>
                     <p>If at the going off of this Di≈øtemper, a hot defluxion ≈øhould fall into the Eyes, take Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir and infu≈øe it in water, and often moi≈øten the Eyes therewith; and if it ≈øhould be cold and windy weather, you will do well to keep your ≈øelf out of the open Air, and not to let this water dry up in your Eyes in the cold wind.</p>
                     <p>In ca≈øe of having lo≈øt thy hearing, take of thy own Urine, and with it wa≈øh thy Ears within, but withal dry them very well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that moi≈øture is very noxious to the Ears: And it often happens, that after the Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sickne≈øs People grow deaf or hard of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Others put the water of <hi>Carduus-benedictus</hi> di≈øtilled with Wine into the Ears, or the Oyl of bitter Almonds.</p>
                     <p>If thy Throat ≈øwell, or the Palate of thy Mouth be fallen down, gargarize thy Throat with warm Milk, wherein Figgs have been boil'd, or ≈øweetned with Sugar. The Flowers of <hi>Phyllirea</hi> or <hi>Mock-privet,</hi> which grows in the Hedges, boiled, and u≈øed for a gargari≈øm, heals al≈øo a ≈øore Throat. The ≈øame doth the

middle rind of <hi>Oxyacantha</hi> or <hi>Haw-thorn,</hi> if boiled, with a little Allom di≈ø≈øolved in the Decoction. If you have the Juice of Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, mix a little Honey of Ro≈øes with it, and often take a little thereof. The Roots of Sloes boiled in red Wine, and the Mouth often wa≈øhed therewith, is al≈øo very good.</p>
                     <p>If thou ha≈øt the Squinancy, boil Scabious in Meath, and drink thereof warm, when ≈øtrain'd. Beat Turnips and fry them in Butter or Oyl, and clap them in a cloth round about thy Neck.</p>
                     <p>If thou ca≈øt up blood, take Mou≈øe-ear, Ground-Ivy, Cumfrey; boil them in half Wine and half Water, or in Meat, and Drink often of it. But if the Plague reign not, open fir≈øt a Vein.</p>
                     <p>For a violent Cough, boil white Turnips, well clean≈øed in common water; throw away this fir≈øt water, pour on other water, and in it let the Turnips boil till they grow ≈øoft. Strain this water, ≈øweeten it with Sugar, or infu≈øe in it Liquorice cut ≈ømall; and drink of it mornings and evenings warm. Or make a Decoction of <hi>St. Johns bread,</hi> and drink it, ab≈øtaining from all four and ≈øalt things.</p>
                     <p>The bleeding at the No≈øe is al≈øo incident to per≈øons infected; which is no good ≈øign, though in ≈øound per≈øons it often frees from the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach and cools the Liver.

                     <p>WHen the Tongue is inflamed, the whole <hi>Oe≈øophagus</hi> or Wea≈øand is inflamed al≈øo, and this from beneath upward, becau≈øe the inward fire ≈øends up its ≈ømoak all along, as it were, that chimney, which like ≈øoot ≈øticks to it, drying and blackning the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>But there is another Inflammation, much more dangerous, which taking its ri≈øe about the Heart, and therefore is call'd the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Heart, which proceeds from the great inflammation of the orifice of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ≈øituate near the heart, in which is in≈øerted the ≈øixth pair of Nerves, which maketh the ≈øaid orifice very ≈øen≈øible of any pain. This part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øeized by ≈øo great an inflammation, which is venomous withal, it mu≈øt in a manner harden, and ≈øhrink; and this heat is of that extent that, the inner Membrane of the Stomach &amp; that of the Tongue being one and the ≈øame, what befalls the Stomach, the Tongue mu≈øt needs be ≈øen≈øible of it. Whence it comes to pa≈øs, that if the Gall overflows and pa≈ø≈øeth into the Stomach, the Tongue pre≈øently finds the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne≈øs of it: or if the Stomach be full of ≈ølime or foul, or the like, the Tongue is ≈øoon affected therewith.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52336:261"/>There is another kind of Inflammation, by the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Prunella alba.</hi> This is of the ≈øame kind with the re≈øt, but not of the ≈øame degree; for 'tis not of ≈øo dry a nature, as the others are, but commonly is moi≈øt, yet overlays all the Gums, the Throat, and the Wea≈øand with ≈øuch a tough white ≈ølime, like a kind of Leather, and ≈øo covers the Almonds with the ≈øame, that ≈øometimes it can hardly be removed even with In≈øtruments. The Tongue is as if it were cru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with dough, the Gums like an Oven that by the heat of fire is burnt white, the Almonds cover'd as 'twere with white leather, and the Palate of the Mouth likewi≈øe. And in this ca≈øe if the Patient will ≈øpeak, he lalls and ≈øtutters, his Tongue being burthen'd with a load of ≈ølime; or, if he make his Tongue wagg, the ≈ølime ≈øpins out like a thred, and ≈øo invades the Teeth as if they were laid over with var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh. And when this varni≈øh on the Teeth grows black (as I have often ob≈øerv'd it to do) and drieth on them, 'tis a mortal ≈øign; of which <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Quibus in febribus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vores circumdentes na≈øcuntur, his fortes fiunt febres,</hi> 4. <hi>Aph.</hi> 53.</p>

Whil≈øt thou art clean≈øing the Patients Mouth, let him often gargari≈øe with the Waters above-≈øpecified, and he will clear his Mouth of the loo≈øen'd lumps. If thou can≈øt get Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-juyce mixt with Honey of Ro≈øes, the Mouth will heal the better; for upon this ≈øort of Inflammation there u≈øually follows a Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Mouth; and in ca≈øe thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive≈øt any ≈øuch thing, take Wood-≈øorrel, and the above ≈øaid rind of Haw-thorn, make a Decoction of it, and put in it a little Allom, and often gargari≈øe with it. Clean thy Teeth from the ≈ølime with Water well ≈øharpned with Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>The common Inflammation of the Mouth may be cured with frequent wa≈øhing of the Mouth, taking a gargari≈øm made of Hou≈øe-leek, Lettice, Night-≈øhade, or Self-heal Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52336:262"/>
mixing a little Honey of Ro≈øes and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-juyce with it. Of this gargari≈øm the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is al≈øo to ≈øwallow a little, thereby to moi≈øten the Throat.</p>
                     <p>Some take Hou≈øe-leek, and beat it, and put to a pound of it half an ounce of Sal-armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, mixing it well together. And ≈øo they put it for ≈øome days in an earthen pot gla≈øed under ground; then they di≈øtill of it a Water in <hi>Balneo</hi> or in Sand: Which is excellent both to drink and to gargari≈øe, though the Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack make it a little unplea≈øant.</p>
                     <p>But there is nothing better to allay this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation than Niter; which is ≈øo well known among≈øt Souldiers, that they are wont to give one another Gunpowder to drink, which Powder performs this effect not upon the account of the Coals or Brim≈øtone, but the Saltpeter.</p>
                     <p>For this cau≈øe Experienced Phy≈øitians and Chirurgeons endeavour to purifie Niter for this u≈øe, that it may have the greater effect; and this they do in manner following:</p>
                     <p>They take of the pure≈øt Niter they can get, as much as they think fit; they beat it to a fine powder, and melt it in a large Crucible, &amp; whil≈øt it boils up and foameth, they pour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it a little powdered Sulphur, and ≈øo let it boil together, till the blew Sulphur-flame cea≈øeth; then they ca≈øt in more fre≈øh Sulphur: Which they repeat often, and then pour out the Niter into an earthen ve≈ø≈øel gla≈øed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Lozenges of it, of which they put one pulveri≈øed into a quart of limpid water, and ≈øo give the Patient to drink of it as much as he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52336:263"/>
needs to quench his thir≈øt. Or they give of this purified Niter to their Patients, labouring under this Inflammation, the quantity of a ducat or half a ducat weight in Broath, or in Pti≈øan, till they find the Tongue cleared of its ≈ølime.</p>
                     <p>The u≈øe of Salt-petre thus prepared remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth al≈øo the Inflammation of the Heart, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be melted upon Lead, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with as before. For Lead is a con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable cooler, of which cooling quality the Niter, whil≈øt it is melting upon it, taketh in not a little. Let then your Lead melt, and when 'tis melted, di≈ø≈øolve the Niter upon it, and then, to purifie it, ca≈øt ≈øome Brim≈øtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as was ≈øaid above, till it be clean≈øed from all impurity; and then give of it to thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient two or three times a day, according as need ≈øhall require.</p>
                     <p>Otherwi≈øe, take live Crafi≈øhes and fre≈øh Hou≈øleek, beat them together in a Mortar, ≈øqueeze out the Juyce, with it mix a little Sal-Armoniack, or a pretty deal of thy prepared Niter; make a Potion of it, and give of it even cold to thy Patient, repeating this ≈øeveral times, every eight or ten hours once, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you ≈øhall ≈øee occa≈øion.</p>
                     <p>Or, take fre≈øh Lard, (if it be ≈øalted, draw it through hot Water to un≈øalt it,) and cut a ≈ølice of it two fingers large, and of the thickne≈øs of a knives back; put this into the Mouth of thy Patient, it is an excellent Remedy again≈øt this Inflammation; of which I ≈øhall give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon hereafter. I have ≈øeen wonders done with it. But if thy Patient do rave, then fa≈øten this ≈ølice of Lard with a Thred and Needle to his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52336:263"/>
Shirt or Doublet, le≈øt he ≈øwallow it. Or take fre≈øh Butter, and put it in cold Water, and of it give thy Patient at a time the quantity of a Ha≈øel-nut to hold it upon his Tongue, and let it melt there; which will keep the Tongue always moi≈øt. And if thou work among this Butter ≈øome of thy prepared Niter, it hath a wonderful effect, though the ta≈øte be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant.</p>
                     <p>I promi≈øed above to explain the Rea≈øon of the Cure of the≈øe Inflammations. When you take a Gargari≈øm of the Waters of <hi>Night-≈øhade, Wood-≈øorrel, Knot-gra≈øs, Endive, Hou≈øleek,</hi> and the like, mingled with Vinegar, you do well, but this is not enough; the rea≈øon is: If you wet a piece of Leather, you make it indeed limber, but when it comes to be dry, it grows hard and ≈øhrinks, except you grea≈øe it over with ≈øome fatty matter, and then it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ≈ømooth. So it is with the Tongue; though it be made clean with Gargari≈øms, yet will it become again rough and untoward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs ≈øome fatne≈øs be u≈øed: For which cau≈øe I have directed to u≈øe Lard, or Butter mixt with Niter.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Almonds</hi> be ≈øwelled, thou mu≈øt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtain from all ≈øowre things, and prepare a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari≈øm of Figgs, St. <hi>Johns</hi> Bread, Mallows-flowers, Liquorice, Elder-canes, mixing with it ≈øome Ro≈øe-honey, or Juyce of Walnuts, or the <hi>Rob Diamorom,</hi> gargling often with it, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this ≈øymptom is a dangerous thing; for when the Throat ≈øwells of it, few Patients do e≈øcape death, e≈øpecially if it be a Pe≈øtilential Squinancy. And in ca≈øe there appear any Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52336:264"/>
outwardly, take fine Flower, Milk and Saffron, making a Pul≈øe of it; and, to keep it from growing hard, mix with it <hi>Althea-≈øalve,</hi> or <hi>Hounds-tongue-≈øalve,</hi> the Oyl of <hi>blew Violets, Mullein, white Lillies, Camomile,</hi> or the like, adding a little Oyl of Scorpions to it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this outwardly.</p>
                     <p>Make al≈øo a Scraper of <hi>Alder-wood,</hi> if it may be had; if not, other wood will ≈øerve, though <hi>Alder</hi> be be≈øt. Throw it into cold Water, and let it lye there, u≈øing it as often as there is need; yet take heed of making thy Tongue ≈øore or raw.</p>

                     <p>IN Camps there is nothing more frequent than Fevers of the Stomach, ari≈øing from ill Dyet, which Souldiers are often put to for want of better, eating what they can get, Chee≈øe, Herbs, Fle≈øh half boiled, ≈øtale and mu≈øty Bread, and the like.

                     <p>In this ca≈øe thou art fir≈øt to purge: And for that purpo≈øe make u≈øe of the <hi>Pulvis ≈øolutivus de tribus,</hi> recommended above, taking the weight of a Ducat, or a Ducat and an half, in warm
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52336:264"/>
Broath, and fa≈øting two or three hours after it. Or fetch from the Apothecary of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatum Diaturbith cum Rhubarbaro,</hi> or the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoenicon in tabulis,</hi> taking half an ounce at a time, and keeping thy Chamber. Or, infu≈øe Sena-leaves in Wormwood-wine, and drink a ≈ømall gla≈øs-ful of it an hour before thy break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa≈øt: This will al≈øo ≈øerve very well, e≈øpecially if ≈øome <hi>Carduus benedictus</hi> have al≈øo been fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the Wormwood-wine.</p>
                     <p>If thou art troubled with Gripings or Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Belly, take of Zedoar, or Angelica-roots, or Orange-peels, cut them ≈ømall, and take at a time the weight of a Ducat in hot Broath. If the Inflation be much, take in the morning the quantity of a Ha≈øel-nut of Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, fa≈øting an hour after it; and if the pains of thy Belly prevail, make a Decoction of Wormwood in Wine, and drink of it as hot as thou can≈øt; this will allay the pains, and give thee ≈øome ≈øtools. Mean time ab≈øtain from raw Fruit, and Beer, Milk, Herbs, and ≈øuch like.</p>
                     <p>If thou art ≈øwollen, take half a drachm of Rubarb, and about the ≈øame quantity or a little le≈øs of Mechocan; reduce it to powder, and take it in Wormwood-wine, or warm Broath, in the morning fa≈øting, and eat nothing within an hour or two after. Be careful to take down ≈øome Treacle in the morning fa≈øting; but you are fir≈øt to be purged. Otherwi≈øe make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Roots of Elecampane and Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernel, or Swallow-wort, in Wine, and drink a warm draught of it mornings; it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Urine. If thou can≈øt bear among≈øt it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52336:265"/>
Wormwood, <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> or Centory, add them in the Decoction, and it is a good potion for the Liver.</p>
                     <p>An Herb, call'd by the <hi>Latins Euphatorium Avicennae,</hi> in <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> (I think) <hi>Common Hemp-Agrimony,</hi> hath a great operation in ≈øwelled People, drinking of the Decoction thereof, made in Wine. Be≈øides, u≈øe in this ca≈øe Par≈øley and Smallage-roots in thy meat. Boil Hor≈øe-radi≈øh, and drink of the Decoction warm in the morning. Thy ordinary drink is to be a water, in which hath been boiled a good quantity of Cummin, Annis or Fennel. You may al≈øo now and then drink a little Wine, ≈øwelled people having no great heat in them.</p>
                     <p>From the≈øe ob≈øtructions of the Liver and Me≈øaraic Veins comes difficulty of Breathing and a dry Cough, which occa≈øions the Inflation of the Belly, and helps to entertain the crudities and indige≈øtions: Mean time there u≈øeth to follow upon this the Yellow Jaundi≈øe. For this, take the Roots of <hi>Cyclamen</hi> or Sow-bread, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to powder, and take the weight of half a ducat in Meath, or Wine mixt with a little Honey, ≈øweating upon it; and you ≈øhall find your ≈øheets di≈øcoloured of a yellowi≈øh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. In the ≈øame manner make u≈øe of the ≈øeed of <hi>Aquileja,</hi> or <hi>Columbine.</hi> I have reduced the≈øe three to powder, and mixt them together, and given of it the weight of a ducat to ≈øweat; which hath proved very ≈øucce≈øsful. Orange-peels u≈øed in like manner, do al≈øo much good in this ca≈øe. The bitter Centory boiled in Meath, and a good draught drank of it warm in the morning, is al≈øo very good.

of the white Hore-hound and Chicory-roots is al≈øo u≈øed to good purpo≈øe in this ca≈øe. The≈øe things expel al≈øo Worms, if any do lodge within thee; for which may al≈øo be u≈øed the Souldiers Pills of <hi>Aloe,</hi> called <hi>Maroco≈øtinae.</hi> In this ca≈øe Vinegar of Squills is al≈øo an excellent remedy, taking of it in the morning early a ≈øpoonful, two or three, and exerci≈øing after it. It will open the Brea≈øt, and make you expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate phlegm and ≈ølime in abundance.</p>
                     <p>If you be troubled with Wind and Gripings of the Guts, be careful to have your Body ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble. Boil <hi>Calamus,</hi> cut ≈ømall, in Broath, drink of it hot, putting a little <hi>Angelica,</hi> or <hi>Ma≈øterwort.</hi> Do this mornings and evenings, and beware of drinking cold, and ab≈øtain from all Milk, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ≈øelf very warm, e≈øpecially about the Feet, which you will do well to bathe with a Decoction made of A≈øarabacca, Camomile, wild Trefoil, wild Marjerom, wild Thyme, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little Salt into it. For your drink, boil Cummin, Annis or Fennel in Water, and now and then a gla≈øs of Wine may do well.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe Gripings may al≈øo be cured with drinking very bitter Wormwood-wine, as hot as you can endure it. This is al≈øo opening. If you boil Elecampane and Orange-peels with the Wormwood, it will have the greater effect. And if you add to it <hi>Allium Sylve≈øtre</hi> (Crow-Garlick) you have an excellent Medicine for this purpo≈øe. This I have u≈øed my ≈øelf, and found pre≈øent relief from it, when in a very hard Winter upon a Journey I was taken with the≈øe Gripings. 'Tis indeed a very unplea≈øant potion, exceeding bitter, e≈øpecially being to be drunk

hot; but the good effects will make amends for that. If the pains ≈øhould not cea≈øe after all this, mix with it the quantity of a Ha≈øel-nut of Treacle or Mithridate, and ≈øo drink it off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>If you can get Malva≈øy, mix a little Oyl of Olives with it, and drink of it warm. Oyl of ≈øweet Almonds would be better, one half of that and the other of Malva≈øy; though the≈øe things perhaps will not ≈øo ea≈øily be had in a Camp. Fre≈øh Butter may ≈øerve in≈øtead of Oyl.</p>
                     <p>El≈øe make a Decoction of Juniper-berries, or Laurel-berries, and Elecampane in ≈øtrong Wine, and drink a good draught of it morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and evenings. Or reduce the Herb <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus benedictus</hi> to powder, and drink its weight of a ducat in warm Malva≈øy or other ≈øtrong Wine; it will remove the Gripings, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if you mix with it a little Zedoary pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øed.</p>
                     <p>For your Meat, take Larks, if they chance to be in ≈øea≈øon, draw them, and fill their bellies with Garlick, and ≈øo ro≈øt and eat them.</p>
                     <p>Make a Decoction of Burnet, or of Ma≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, and Laurel berries, in Beer, ≈øtrain it, and melt a little Butter in it, adding a little Pepper, and ≈øo drink of it hot.</p>
                     <p>For an outward Application, take the Oyl of Rue and Wormwood, dip Cotton into it, and put it warm to thy Navil.

                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52336:266"/>The Oyl of Laurel-berries, mixing a little Juniper-berry-oyl or Nutmeg-oyl with it, may be u≈øed with great benefit, anointing the Navil therewith, and afterwards put to the Navil a warm dry bag filled with Bran and Camomile-blo≈ø≈øoms. Or fry Cow-dung in the Oyl of Dill, or of Camomile, or of white Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and apply it thus to thy Navil, keeping thy ≈øelf, and e≈øpecially thy Leggs, very warm.</p>
                     <p>If you perceive any Hydropical Di≈øtemper in you, make a Decoction of Wormwood and Juniper-berries in Wine, drink every morning a warm draught of it fa≈øting. You may al≈øo to very good purpo≈øe boil with it Swallow-wort, Burnet, or Succory-roots, adding al≈øo to it ≈øome Annis or Fennel≈øeed. But it will be requi≈øite fir≈øt of all to purge with Mechoacan and Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb; and now and then to repeat this purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ab≈øtain from Milk, Beer, Fruit, and all raw and ob≈øtructing food. If you knew how to u≈øe Elder, you would have an excellent Purge to free your Body from the Hydropical water, becau≈øe the Juyce of the Roots of Elder pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Hydropical Per≈øons exceedingly: But 'tis not ≈øo ≈øafe to u≈øe it, unle≈øs you do it with great caution, becau≈øe a very little of it taken inwardly purgeth both by ≈øtool and vomit, like Antimony. Half a nut≈øhel full may ≈øuffice. The like effect you'l find in Elder-buds boiled, and then dre≈ø≈øed with Oyl and Vinegar like a Salad, eating a very little of it. But I advi≈øe you not to u≈øe too much of it; el≈øe it will ca≈øt you into great faintne≈øs. The juyce of the Roots of blew Lillies hath the like vertue, but is likewi≈øe to be u≈øed with great di≈øcretion.</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:52336:269"/>For the Patients ordinary drink, boil water, and in it Coriander, dried Sloes, dried ≈ølices of Quinces, burnt Harts-horn, Ma≈øtick, Nutmeg, or any one of the≈øe; putting to it ≈øome of the roots of Snake-weed, Tormentil, or ≈øuch like ad≈øtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent roots.

                     <p>The red Juyce of Quinces, boiled up without Sugar, is al≈øo much to be commended in this ca≈øe, for ≈øtrengthening the bowels, two or three ≈øpoonfuls of it being taken at a time, and that twice a day.</p>
                     <p>In many places a drink is made of Sloes, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øella</hi> or Mou≈øe-ear, and Juniper-berries, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing them all in common water, and letting them ferment together. This yields a plea≈øant acid drink, allaying the violence of the Flux, and quenching thir≈øt withal.</p>
                     <p>The Rich may make Granat or Quince-wine. But I have here undertaken to deliver ≈øuch things, as are parable and cheap for the poor common Souldier.</p>
                     <p>I am ≈øorry, that in the Field there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of admini≈øtring Cly≈øters: For, though I pre≈øcribe none without great nece≈ø≈øity; yet Cly≈øters being of great benefit in Di≈øea≈øes of the bowels; they being to them like Plai≈øters, I cannot but recommend in this Di≈øtemper Cly≈øters of Milk, wherein Pebble-≈øtones have been ≈øeveral times quenched, mixing a little of the melted Suet of a Stag or Hind, without any Oyl or other fat. I remember, I had once a Patient of quality, that had about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ≈øtools within twenty four hours, who by the u≈øe of ≈øuch Cly≈øters, once or twice applied,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52336:270"/>
was fully re≈øtored. The cau≈øe whereof is, that the Milk wa≈øhes the bowels, and clears them of the ≈øharp humors that annoy them; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is healing and repairing, by rea≈øon of the Pebbles quenched therein. The Sugar is ab≈øter≈øive, and helps to clean the injured pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Fat ≈øticks to the parts annoyed, to defend them from being further hurt by the ≈øub≈øequent humors, which running down over it, can find no ≈øtay there, and con≈øequently cau≈øe no more hurt to tho≈øe parts.</p>
                     <p>Yet mu≈øt you not put in any grea≈øie Fat, or any Oyl of Olives, becau≈øe they hinder heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all Oyl, except that of Lin≈øeed, Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, Hemp and Almonds, is very ≈øharp; and you will find, that if any drop of Oyl of Olives ≈øhould chance to fall into your Eye, no Juyce of Oranges or Limons is ≈øo ≈øtrong as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the acrimony of that Oyl. But of this Oyl more will be ≈øaid in the next Chapter, to which I therefore refer you. If you would have your Cly≈øter yet milder and more ≈øana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, you may beat a yolk or two of new-laid Eggs, and mix them with it; though I have contented my ≈øelf with the Ingredients before mention'd, and found great benefit thereby. El≈øe you may in this ca≈øe u≈øe for a Cly≈øter the <hi>Cremor hordei,</hi> mixt with yolks of Eggs bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it; which is al≈øo very good to wa≈øh out the bowels.</p>
                     <p>Here is no conveniency of making much u≈øe of Apothecary-≈øhops; el≈øe many things might be pre≈øcribed to lay upon the belly and the navil, as al≈øo divers fermentations, and ≈øtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Unguents. You may therefore content
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52336:270"/>
your ≈øelf with tho≈øe plain and ea≈øily parable means, already deliver'd, and be thankful to God for them.</p>
                     <p>But then you are al≈øo to think upon means to obviate Symptoms of this Di≈øtemper, and particularly <hi>Drought,</hi> which is wont very much to torment people in this Di≈øea≈øe. 'Tis true, Acid things do quench thir≈øt, but they cannot be u≈øed boldly, and therefore you mu≈øt u≈øe them with great di≈øcretion and warine≈øs. And as for ≈øweet things, they u≈øually increa≈øe thir≈øt, and do ea≈øily corrupt, and turn into gall. Wherefore give to the Patient pre≈øerved Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans; or if fre≈øh ones be in ≈øea≈øon, mix a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them with Honey or Sugar, and give him of it to eat upon white-Bread and Butter. Or plump dried Black-cherries, or dried Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øcene-prunes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in half Wine and half Water, and let him hold &amp; ≈øqueeze them in his mouth. Or, if you can, mingle ≈øome Almond-milk with Chalybeat-water, and let him drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and this is both meat and drink. Or let him drink water, wherein Coriander and roots of Tormentil have been boiled. Or boil in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dried ≈ølices of Quinces, roots of <hi>Bi≈øtorta</hi> or Snake-weed, and burnt Harts-horn, put into it a to≈øted cru≈øt of Rye-bread rubb'd with Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg, but let it not lye in it above a quarter of an hour, le≈øt the water ≈øhould thicken and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vi≈øcous. Marmelat al≈øo of Quinces, Black-cherries, and Sloes is proper in this ca≈øe, giving the Patient a ≈ølice of it to hold upon his tongue, and ≈øo to ≈øwallow it down.</p>
                     <p>Further, you mu≈øt learn how to remedy a <hi>Tena≈ømus,</hi> which is more irk≈øome to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52336:271"/>
and, occa≈øions more trouble to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitian, than the Bloody-flux it ≈øelf, ≈øince it night and day painfully provokes the poor Patient to go to ≈øtool, and yet to no purpo≈øe. For this I have u≈øed many remedies, but found almo≈øt nothing more beneficial, than Fomentations of this nature following: Take <hi>Potentilla</hi> (wild Tan≈øie Silver-weed) Knot-gra≈øs, Mullein, and Oak-leaves, of each as much as you plea≈øe, put them into two linnen bags, and let them boil in Smiths-water, wherein much Iron hath been quenched: Squeeze out the≈øe bags be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two boards, and let them be held alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to the <hi>anus,</hi> as hot as can be endured. Black Pitch, ≈øuch as is found on Larch and Fir-trees, put upon a heated fire-≈øhovel, and the fundament held over it, is al≈øo a good remedy; &amp; ≈øo is Turpentine, u≈øed after the ≈øame manner.</p>
                     <p>Again, take a black well-burnt Brick out of the hearth, heat it thoroughly, and wet it with ≈øharp Vinegar, and wrap it about with a linnen cloth, and let the Patient ≈øit on it as hot as he can endure it. This was the Experiment and Remedy of old <hi>Aetius</hi>; but he reduced the Brick to powder, and by boiling it in Vinegar, reduced it to a pul≈øe, and ≈øo put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a linnen rag, and applied it to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You may chu≈øe which you plea≈øe of the two.</p>
                     <p>Milk-Cly≈øters, ≈øuch as above pre≈øcribed, would al≈øo be good, but that 'tis not ≈øafe with Cly≈øter-pipes to vex the <hi>anus,</hi> which is already ≈øore enough. Yet you may give a Suppo≈øitory of Deers-≈øuet mixt with ≈øome Oyl of Mullein. And the grey <hi>Diapompholox,</hi> or the white Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire-unguent,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52336:271"/>
or the like, mixt with it, would not be improper in this ca≈øe.</p>
                     <p>If there be a Falling down of the fundament, then let it often take in the fumes of the above-mention'd Herbs, adding to them the beaten ≈øtalks of Sloe-≈øhrubs, and tho≈øe of red Ro≈øes, as al≈øo Mou≈øe-ear, and Mug-wort. The outer bark of Elder, and of Shepherds-pur≈øe, doth al≈øo well with it. But above all things keep the Patient warm, and let by no means any of the above≈øaid ≈øteams grow cold on the ≈øore part.</p>
                     <p>Make al≈øo a Decoction of Garlick, and pour it hot into your clo≈øe-≈øtool, let the Patient ≈øit upon it, to receive the hot ≈øteams. Be≈øides, put ≈øome burnt Harts-horn in a linnen cloth, and ≈øo ≈øtrew it upon the fundament, by little and little to drew it up. Or heat an Oaken-board very well, and cover it over with Stags-≈øuet, and let the Patient ≈øit upon it whil≈øt 'tis hot. Put <hi>Colophonium</hi> or the Ro≈øin of Pinetree upon a heated Iron, and let the Patient by holding his fundament over it take in the ≈øteams thereof, Anoint al≈øo the part with Butter, in which Onions have been boiled; and ≈øtrew upon it <hi>Album-graecum</hi> very finely pulveri≈øed. You may al≈øo make a Salve of Ceru≈øe, Bol-Armeniack, Dragons-blood, Stags-≈øuet, Blood-≈øtone, Oyl of Myrrh, or Butter in which fir≈øt hath been boiled broad Plantain, Mullein, or wild Tan≈øie Silver-weed; and with this anoint the fundament.</p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Mari≈øca's,</hi> which do torment Men e≈øpecially, they may be cured with Oyl of Eggs, Salve of red Hounds-tongue, as al≈øo with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52336:272"/>
the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nguentum Populeum,</hi> or with Butter ≈øtirr'd up and down in a Leaden Mortar, till it turn grey or blacki≈øh, Let the Patient drink al≈øo of <hi>Scrophularia</hi> or Fig-wort, infu≈øed in his drink, this being a ≈øpecifick for that evil. Al≈øo the Oyl of Mullein, Elder-blo≈ø≈øoms, Water-lilly, and White-lillies, is an excellent remedy for it, a rag dipped therein being laid upon the part affected. To u≈øe ≈øcarifying on the lower part of the back-bone, is al≈øo very good, though it be very painful.</p>
                     <p>If the Hoemorrhoid-vein bleed in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, and do not overbleed, it is an exceeding good thing, and pre≈øerves from many Di≈øea≈øes, as the Inflammation of the Lungs, Stitches of the ≈øides, the Lepro≈øie, Melancholly, Quartans, and the like. If the ≈øame vein ≈øhould bleed in one that is mad, or di≈øturbed in his mind, or in one that is troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Inflammation of the Kindneys, the≈øe Di≈øtempers would thereby be allayed. But if it ≈øhould bleed too often &amp; too violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it weakens much, cau≈øeth a pale colour and the Drop≈øie. My Collegues and I have often open'd it by Leeches, and thereby found great benefit. But in ca≈øe it ≈øhould exceed in bleeding, you mu≈øt deal with it as you do with the Bloody Flux, and give to the Patient <hi>Terra Sigillata, Bol-Armeniack,</hi> burnt Harts-horn, and the like ad≈øtringent things. If you can get ≈øome teeth of the <hi>Hippo-potamus,</hi> ra≈øp it into powder, and drink ≈øome of it in red or white wine; it ≈øtops all bleeding, of the no≈øe, mouth, guts, fundament, hoemorrhoids, the matrix, e≈øpecially the bleeding of Women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter delivery.</p>

                     <p>Concerning then the Pe≈øtilential Bubo's and Sores, that ri≈øe behind the Ears, under the Arms, and about the Groin, the Cure of them con≈øi≈øts chiefly in this, that they be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd with ≈øpeed; for which end are to be employed meer emollient and ≈øuppurating things. Yet are you to know to di≈øtingui≈øh between Boyls, there being ≈øome of them that are not venomous, e≈øpecially in young people; and they may be hereby di≈øcerned, that at the touch they cau≈øe no pain, whereas the Pe≈øtilential ones are very painful; which are al≈øo di≈øcover'd by the accompanying veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Fever, and other pernicious Symptoms. And of the≈øe latter great care mu≈øt be had to bring them out, and to a ≈øpeedy maturation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe tho≈øe that lye deep are very dangerous.</p>

But ≈øuch means have rather irritated the evil, cau≈øed great pains, and put the Patient to greater danger.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I judge nothing ≈øafer and better, than, as I was intimating, to u≈øe <hi>Emollients.</hi> Take then of the common Diachylon, and lay it upon the invenom'd Boyls; and be≈øides make a pul≈øe of the≈øe herbs, <hi>viz.</hi> of Camomile, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Melilot, Dill, Line-≈øeed, Fenu-greek, Althaea, the roots of White Lillies, as al≈øo ≈øalve of Althaea, Oyl of Camomile and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, mixing a little Saffron with it, and ≈øome Oyl of Scorpions.

                     <p>Now when the Sores are ≈øoftned and ripe, and yet break not of them≈øelves, they are to be opened with a lancet; and if you have to do with Per≈øons ≈øo delicate that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a lancet, you may make u≈øe of the <hi>Lapis Septicus</hi> or Corro≈øive-≈øtone, which opens with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain, but is more ≈ølow.

Mean time, enlarge the opening of the Boyls with the afore≈øaid Pellets, that ≈øo the matter may have vent enough, and come away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impediment.</p>
                     <p>The Unguent of <hi>

In≈øtead of the Juyce of Night-≈øhade, you may take that of Cumfry.</p>

                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52336:274"/>As for the Sores call'd <hi>Anthraces,</hi> and tho≈øe they call Carbuncles, great care mu≈øt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to break them ≈øoon, and to heal them ≈ølowly, that ≈øo the poy≈øonous matter may all come away. They ripen and break ≈øoone≈øt by fatty (but not hot) Plai≈øters and Unguents; e≈øpecially ≈øuch as are made of Butter, Leaven, Yolks of Eggs, and Honey; or if you mix to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Turpentine, <hi>

It mu≈øt be often refre≈øhed, becau≈øe ≈øuch hot Sores and Ulcers, before they break, do ≈øo draw, wa≈øte, and, as 'twere, lick up tho≈øe fatne≈ø≈øes, that ≈øometimes of the Plai≈øters, that have lain on them, there remains nothing but the bare ragg. The <hi>Empla≈øtrum Ba≈øilicon,</hi> or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon yellow drawing Plai≈øter, is here the mo≈øt u≈øeful.</p>
                     <p>You mu≈øt al≈øo ≈øurround the <hi>Anthrax</hi> with good defen≈øives; for if it invade the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring part never ≈øo little, it will ≈øoon make a large <hi>halo</hi> or circle, which will at length ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the ≈øound, and fall away like an <hi>E≈øcarre.</hi> For ≈øuch defen≈øives make u≈øe of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Camphoratum,</hi> or the <hi>

and the fre≈øh leaves of Henbane, beaten together, and the Juyce ≈øtrained, and ≈øo u≈øed. Of this Ointment you may make much with confidence; for it will do you very good ≈øervice in Inflammations, e≈øpecially in the ca≈øe of the ≈øwelling of the Groins.</p>
                     <p>Among≈øt the approved Medicines for this purpo≈øe, may de≈øervedly be reckoned the Plai≈øter made of Soot; which is thus to be prepared: Take of the fine≈øt Chimney-≈øoot one ounce and a quarter; of Leaven, Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and fre≈øh Butter, <hi>ana</hi> one ounce; of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Soap an ounce and a half; two Yolks of Eggs; of Treacle and Mithridate, <hi>ana</hi> a quarter of an ounce: Beat all the≈øe together in a Mortar, and ≈øo reduce it to a pa≈øte, and then u≈øe it Plai≈øter-wi≈øe.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Anthrax</hi> or the Carbuncle is broken, you mu≈øt then handle it very gently and di≈øcreetly, u≈øing only the above-de≈øcribed Egg-≈øalve, putting it into the opening, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Sore only with the common yellow drawing Plai≈øter, or the Plai≈øter prepared of Oyl, Wax and Ro≈øin, or Turpentine. Let the matter work out well, and when you are ≈øure that 'tis very clean, and have a mind to con≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate it, make only u≈øe of <hi>Triapharmacon,</hi> vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call'd the brown <hi>Diachylon</hi>; you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides put into it ≈øome of the <hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52336:275"/>
as often happens, then make u≈øe of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla≈øtrum Apo≈øtolorum.</hi> But if you can prepare the <hi>Diapalma,</hi> otherwi≈øe called <hi>Diacalcithros,</hi> make u≈øe of that.

Such a Plai≈øter is al≈øo that, which is called <hi>I≈øis,</hi> to be found in <hi>Galen,</hi> and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame thing. They are both to be found in the <hi>Augu≈øtan</hi> Di≈øpen≈øatory, together with the way of preparing them.</p>
                     <p>Now what concerns <hi>Old</hi> Sores, which many are troubled with, in their Leggs e≈øpecially, becau≈øe the humors of the body u≈øually ≈øettle there; you mu≈øt above all things be careful to keep them clean, and to that end wa≈øh them, at lea≈øt once a day, with your own Urine: Or boil <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> Egrimony, Plantain, and Roots of Tormentil, in half ≈ømall Meath and half Wine, and wa≈øh the Ulcer with it, as often as you dre≈øs it. Among the common Plai≈øters for ≈øuch evils is the brawn <hi>Diachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> one of the be≈øt. El≈øe you may prepare this Ointment which follows: Take the middle rind of Elder, and St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort, boil them in Oyl, putting a little Wine to it, and ≈øo let it boil up till the Wine be boiled away; then take it off from the fire, and let it cool; this done, ≈øtir a little Turpentine among≈øt it, and a Yolk or two of Eggs, according as you make a greater or le≈ø≈øer quantity; mixing with it a little Allum and Vitriol, (the white is the be≈øt,) ≈øtir all well together, and apply it to the Ulcer, and make a bandage, and cover it as u≈øually. For a good Drawing-plai≈øter,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52336:276"/>
take Ro≈øin, Bees-wax and Oyl-Olive; the quantity of the Ro≈øin mu≈øt be but the half of the Wax: Let them melt together, and ≈øtir among≈øt it ≈øome Tartar exqui≈øitely powder'd. U≈øe not much of fatty things to ≈øuch Ulcers. I have had under my care ≈øuch Ulcers, that were to be healed with only dry things, as with ≈øtrewing in of <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> and the red Earth of Vitriol, of which hereafter.</p>
                     <p>For this rea≈øon the antient Phy≈øicians and Chirurgeons invented a dry Stone, which they kept ≈øo ≈øecret, that they called it <hi>Lapis Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophorum</hi>; which is ea≈øily made, as followeth: Take Allum, Hungarian Vitriol, of each one pound, beat them to powder, and mix them well together; then put all into a gla≈øed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then pot, and pour upon it two quarts of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, boil them together, and ≈øtir them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> taking off the ≈øcum: When 'tis boiled in, put to it an ounce of <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> an ounce and a half of Ceru≈øe, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ounce of Camphir, all finely powder'd, ≈øtirring it well about; la≈øtly, put it to a quart of ≈øharp Vinegar, and boil all together to a ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny con≈øi≈øtence; which reduce to powder, and of it ≈øtrew a little into the Ulcer, or let ≈øome of it di≈ø≈øolve in a convenient Liquor, and wa≈øh the Ulcer therewith, or dip ≈øome Linnen raggs in it, and lay it over the place.</p>
                     <p>'Tis al≈øo prepared this way: Take green and white Vitriol, of each a drachm; of <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> Ceru≈øe, Bol-Armeniack, of each two ounces and a half; of Sal-Armoniack an ounce. Beat them all to powder, put them in an earthen pot, mingle and ≈øtir them together
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52336:276"/>
in Vinegar, to be a thick pul≈øe; then put your pot upon a hot Charcoal-fire, to let it grow red hot, ≈øo as that the matter be reduced to a ≈øtony con≈øi≈øtence; of which di≈ø≈øolve about half an ounce in half a pint of Water, dip Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen raggs into it, and put it twice a day upon the Ulcer. 'Tis al≈øo very good for purulent Brea≈øts.</p>
                     <p>I was ≈øpeaking above of <hi>Lavements</hi>: The≈øe you may prepare of all ≈øorts of Wound-herbs, by boiling Con≈øound, Bugle; Fluellin, Ground-Ivy, Yarrow, Snake-weed, Avens, Ar≈ømart; you may al≈øo, again≈øt putrefaction and the ≈øettling of purulent matter, mix ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little Myrrh, or <hi>Aloes Epatica,</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincen≈øe, Ma≈øtick, quick Brim≈øtone, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, Niter, Allum, Vitriol, or the like. Nor is it needful to bind your ≈øelf to this or that preci≈øely, but you may take ≈øuch of them as you can get.</p>
                     <p>I have a peculiar Ulcer-≈øalve, which I call <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nguentum Decameron,</hi> being made of ten ≈øorts of Juices. Of the≈øe the principal is the Juice of <hi>Per≈øicaria,</hi> (Ar≈ømart;) to which are added the Juices of Ground≈øel, Tobacco, Yarrow, ≈øharp-pointed Dock, Cranes-bill, broad and pointed Plantain, Centory, St. <hi>Johns</hi>-wort, and Celondine. The≈øe Juices mu≈øt be well ≈øtrained, and then kept for ≈øome days in gla≈ø≈øes or gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Ve≈ø≈øels to ≈øettle, and then very gently pour off the clear from the ≈øediment. Which done, boil them with fre≈øh Butter, and ≈øome good Licori≈øh newly ≈øcraped, as al≈øo ≈øome Tormentil and Cumfrey, adding a little red Hounds-tongue Salve and Oyl of Myrrh, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52336:277"/>
Deer-≈øuet: Let all be boiled together, till the cracking cea≈øe, and the Juice be boiled in. Then ≈øtrain it through a Linnen Cloth; and add to it ≈øome Venice-Turpentine, Gum <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> and a little Bees-wax, both the latter melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each a part. Of the Wax there needs no more than to bring the Salve to a due con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Then is this Unguent prepared, to which may be added a little refined Verdigrea≈øe, which will make it perfect. It is of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in foul Wounds, for both clean≈øing and healing; as experience will ≈øhew.</p>
                     <p>A Chirurgeon, in meeting with Ulcers, is to ob≈øerve well the purulent matter that i≈ø≈øues, ≈øince he may from thence learn the condition of the evil, whether it proceed from foul Blood, Gall, corrupt Phlegm, or Adu≈øt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. If the evil grow wor≈øe, and the Humors of the Body force their way copiou≈øly thorow, then beware, and withal exhort the Patient to purge, or to ≈øweat with taking ≈øome Sa≈ø≈øafra≈øs, or the like.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sanies</hi> or matter that is thick, white, and well dige≈øted, is the be≈øt; but when there runs but a ≈øharp water out of the Ulcer, this is not good, and is withal painful. Which to obviate, you mu≈øt u≈øe Litharge, Ceru≈øe, and the like; putting al≈øo beaten Lead upon the place, and clean≈øing the fi≈øtulat holes with Lead-oyl, qualifying its ≈øharpne≈øs with Oyl of Eggs. This Lead-oyl is made two ways, the the one out of Ceru≈øe, which is green; the other out of Litharge, which is yellow or red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øh Both are prepared with Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Boil <hi>Celondine</hi> in wine, and with this wine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52336:277"/>
you may al≈øo clean≈øe the Ulcer with good effect. Mix afterwards a drachm of Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grea≈øe with about four ounces of the Juyce of Ground-Ivy; u≈øe it with wiecks or raggs dipt therein for the foul Ulcer-holes.</p>
                     <p>Burn Oy≈øter-≈øhells to powder, and u≈øe it for old Ulcers that need clean≈øing, which this powder will well perform by rea≈øon of the Salt that is in tho≈øe ≈øhells. You may ≈øometimes have occa≈øion al≈øo of the <hi>Mercurius praecipitatus,</hi> or the <hi>Mercurius dulcis Co≈ømeticus.</hi> If you can prepare this you have a good Remedy.</p>
                     <p>As for hard Knobs and Boyls, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly owing their ri≈øe to the Venereal Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe are not ≈øo proper for this place. However you may make a plai≈øter again≈øt ≈øuch Knobs of the phlegm of Althaea or Mar≈øh-mallows, Gummi Ammoniac, Galbanum, Turpentine, Myrrh, Mi≈ø≈øel-toe of the oak, mixing a little Bee-wax therewith and ≈øome Oyl of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms. If you will have it ≈øtronger, mix with it Gumm Elemi, Tacamahaca or Carana. But this can only be compa≈ø≈øed by the rich men; the poor mu≈øt be content with the Melilot-plai≈øter, mixt with Saffron and the Oyl of Mullain or Dill. You may al≈øo prepare for ≈øuch Patients a Salve of Fox-oyl, Dill-oyl, Turpentine, Man-grea≈øe, and the like, mixing therewith ≈øome Oyl of Earth-worms and the Oyl of Mullain-flowers, Camomil and white Lillies.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Chirurgical means of ≈øtaunching blood, of Wound-bal≈øoms and plai≈øters, of Wound-drinks, and remedies for Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</head>
                     <p>THis is the mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary <hi>Chapter</hi> of this whole Tract. For, although in every Camp, yea in every Regiment, and even in every Company there ought to be one or more Chirurgeons; yet becau≈øe in a battle, or the ≈øtorming of a ≈øtrong-hold, there may be wounded a very great number of men, who, by rea≈øon of the multitude, cannot all be dre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by the Chirurgeons, every common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, that is ≈øound and unhurt, is obliged to a≈ø≈øi≈øt his fellow, con≈øidering it may ≈øoon be his own ca≈øe.</p>
                     <p>In the fir≈øt place then, refre≈øh thy fellow that is wounded, with wine, cold water, vinegar, or the like; then place him in a right po≈øture. For, if the wounds be in the head or about the brea≈øt, you ought to lay him high with his head and ≈øhoulders, that ≈øo the blood may ≈øink down from the places wounded. If his legg be hurt, put it ≈øo that it may not hang downwards, and thereby the afflux from the body be prevented, which otherwi≈øe might cau≈øe a tumour. If the wounds be in the middle of the body, then place him
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52336:278"/>
≈øo, that, if po≈ø≈øible, he may lye ≈øomewhat hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with his back.</p>
                     <p>This done, wa≈øh the wound very gently, (≈øo as not to anger it,) with meer wine, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with pure common water, only with a very little ≈øalt ca≈øt into it: or with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients own urine; and then dry it with lint of long-worn linnen, without much ≈øtirring in the wound, for fear of making the veins bleed again.</p>
                     <p>If any one do bleed ≈øo copiou≈øly, that it is not ea≈øily ≈øtopp'd, and the Patient is in danger<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> then receive of his blood in an Iron pan, and letting it run about therein, hold it over the fire till it be dry and between your fingers fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to powder; of which ≈øtrew ≈øome into the bleeding wound, and it will ≈øtop it. But of this ca≈øe more hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The wound being clean≈øed, and the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øtayed, take fine linnen-raggs, burn them as you are wont to do for tinder, and quench it in Oyl of Olives; and put ≈øome of it into the wound, If you have no plai≈øter at hand<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> take a ≈ølice of un≈øalted lard and lay it on. If that be al≈øo wanting, dip a pledget of linnen-raggs in warm wine, and being wrung out very dry, lay it upon the wound, and a dry bandage over it, that ≈øo the moi≈øt pledget may long keep warm. Though in ≈øuch wounds, as are apt to bleed much, warm bandages are often to be avoided, and ≈øometimes (but with ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular care and di≈øcretion) cold bandages to be u≈øed, if the hurt be not in the brain, brea≈øt or bowels. Whence old <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath this Aphori≈øm: <hi>Frigido ver√≤ in iis locis utendum, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52336:279"/>
≈øanguis aut fluit aut fluxurus e≈øt.</hi> Yet this mu≈øt be done with great caution, le≈øt in the place affected there ≈øhould follow a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</p>
                     <p>After this, take Oyl of Olives and Wine, beat them well together, and warm the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; dip it in Linnen pledgets, wring them dry, and lay them on warm with a dry ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage over it. This mu≈øt de done once every hour, or every two hours, nor let this care and labour ≈øeem irk≈øom to you, for it will have a good effect.</p>
                     <p>This Dre≈øs is almo≈øt the only thing, which the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Maltha</hi> make u≈øe of at Sea to heal their wounds; for the Oyl allays the pain and the ≈øwelling, as the Wine clean≈øeth, and the≈øe two together cau≈øe healing. Whence the <hi>Samaritan</hi> in the Go≈øpel is ≈øaid to have poured only Oyl and Wine into the wounds of him, that was fallen among Thieves. You may therefore make out of the≈øe two a Wound-≈øalve that may be equivalent to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt every common Wound-bal≈øom, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it thus:</p>
                     <p>Take one part of Oyl-olive, and two parts of Wine, boil them together till the Wine be boiled in, and the Oyl, when any is thrown into the fire, cracks no more; and you have a Wound-oyl according to wi≈øh: Put of it with fine Linnen ≈øhavings into the wound, and it will, for a plain Remedy, do marvels.</p>
                     <p>You may al≈øo melt Lard un≈øalted, mix it with Honey and Rye-flower, and ≈øo make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Salve, which, though plain and ≈øimple, may when put upon the Wound, have as good an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52336:279"/>
effect, as many Plai≈øters that are in great e≈øteem.</p>
                     <p>Otherwi≈øe, for a very good Wound-≈øalve, take of the be≈øt <hi>Aloes</hi> cleanly pulveri≈øed the weight of a ducat, mingle and ≈øtir it with half an ounce of fine Honey; melt afterwards by it ≈øelf half an ounce of Deer-≈øuet, and ≈øtir it among the other Ingredients: Thus you have a good Salve again≈øt the putrefaction of wounds, and for the a≈ø≈øwaging of their pains, as al≈øo for healing them, if you duly apply it to the wound: If you'l add to it a little Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus-Turpentine with the Yolk of an Egg, you may.</p>
                     <p>The black Wheel-grea≈øe in a time of need is al≈øo a good Wound-≈øalve, and is only de≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed becau≈øe of its plainne≈øs. When you u≈øe it, lay only over it the leaves of Snake-weed, or of pointed Plantain.</p>
                     <p>But by all means keep the wound clean, and let not many look into it, for fear they ≈øhould by their breath annoy it; ≈øome being fa≈øting, others having eaten one thing, others ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But e≈øpecially admit not many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when you open the wound for clean≈øing and dre≈ø≈øing it. But above all things take care to exclude the Air as much as is po≈ø≈øible from the open'd wound, e≈øpecially if any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Nerve be hurt. Take notice, that Carpenters and Joyners, when they have hurt them≈øelves, do almo≈øt by this only means of well clo≈øing their wounds, and keeping out the Air, heal them≈øelves. They take a very thin chip, and lay upon it ≈øome of the Glue, wherewith they joyn together the Boards of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52336:280"/>
their work, and this they apply to the wound, fir≈øt well clean≈øed, and let it lye on, till it fall off of it ≈øelf, and the wound is healed. But this will not do in ca≈øe any Bones be hurt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> take Honey and the Du≈øt-flower of the Mills, fre≈øh Butter and Bol-armeniack, and knead it well together, without any fire, until it be as thick as a Plai≈øter, and this laid on is very good.</p>

                        <hi>Item,</hi> take Cumphrey well clean≈øed, cut it ≈ømall, add to it one or two of the Vulnerary Herbs, ≈øuch as you may meet with in the field, as <hi>Pyrola</hi> or Winter-green, Yarrow, Plantain, Fluellin, Orpin, Con≈øound, Sanicle, Bugle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Boil this in Lin≈øeed-oyl and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wine, until the Wine is boiled away; and this being ≈øtrained, put to it ≈øome raw Honey and one or two well beaten yolks of Eggs, (according to the quantity you make) and a little Turpentine, and ≈øo thru≈øt it, with ≈øome Hemp or Flax dip in it, into the wound.</p>
                     <p>Lime-water is one of the ≈øimple≈øt or plaine≈øt Remedies, but healeth admirably well. Take only ≈øome un≈ølaked Lime, pour on it clear Water, and let it ≈øtand upon it till the Lime be fallen to the bottom: Wa≈øh the wound with it, e≈øpecially ≈øuch as are old running Sores, and you'l find a wonderful effect.</p>
                     <p>The≈øe plain means may be u≈øed, in ca≈øe you want a Chyrurgeon, taking the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of your Fellow-≈øouldier in the application; though tho≈øe very Remedies may challenge a place among the mo≈øt chargeable ones, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed and applied by Ma≈øters. And provided the Chyrurgeon do not under-value the≈øe my
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52336:280"/>
plain and cheap Remedies, but receive them thankfully, I am ready here to teach him ≈øome ways, hitherto concealed by me, which I ≈øcruple to keep any longer from publick knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Know then fir≈øt, that to a Phy≈øician belongs al≈øo the knowledge of Chirurgery, as a third part of the Art of Medicine, the other two being the <hi>Pharmaceutica,</hi> pre≈øcribing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for inward Di≈øea≈øes, and the <hi>Diatetica,</hi> ordering the Patients Diet and other nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I have my ≈øelf, whil≈øt I practi≈øed Phy≈øick, dre≈ø≈øed in Camps many wounds with my own hands and cured them, carrying always my Chirurgical <hi>apparatus</hi> about me, without any di≈øparagement to my Profe≈ø≈øion; imitating herein the Examples above-alledged, of <hi>Podaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Machaon,</hi> two of the chief Phy≈øicians of the Antients in the Army before <hi>Troy,</hi> who were not at all a≈øhamed to practi≈øe Chirurgery, and to attend the cure of wounded Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt of all then, con≈øider well, whether the wound be mortal or no. Next, what limb or part it is that hath received the wound: The wounds in the Head are commonly the mo≈øt dangerous, by rea≈øon of the Symptoms inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them, as the Apoplexy, Falling-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or other Convul≈øions, the Pal≈øey and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Limbs by rea≈øon of the hurt Nerves, as al≈øo Phren≈øy, lo≈øs of Hearing and Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are wont to be con≈øequent, according as the re≈øpective Nerves have been ≈øtruck or wounded. If the Brea≈øt be any where wounded, great care al≈øo is to be had, and the means mu≈øt be directed to prevent purulency,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52336:281"/>
(which that place, by rea≈øon of the heat there, is ≈øubject to,) and to heal the <hi>Pleura</hi> or the inner Membrane of the Ribbs; the like is to be done concerning the Diaphragme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ought al≈øo to ob≈øerve, what kind of wound it is you have to do with, whether any Bone, any Nerve or Artery be hurt; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a meer fle≈øh-wound, and the like. If it be a gaping wound, you mu≈øt, if it hath taken cold from the Air, bathe it with warm Wine, and keep it very clo≈øe; and make u≈øe of the ≈øtrong a≈øtringent Plai≈øter, prepared of Ro≈øin, Gumm Elemi, Turpentine, Pitch, with ≈øome Ma≈øtick, Frankincen≈øe, <hi>Sarcocolla,</hi> as al≈øo ≈øome Blood-≈øtone, Mummy, and <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Martis</hi> mixt therewith, and keep all on carefully with a good bandage, which is a great matter in all wounds. For, ≈øome months ≈øince, I had a Patient under my cure, who≈øe Skull in the place of one of its futures was ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, ≈øo as that I found a con≈øiderable ≈øpace between the two parts ≈øeparated. I order'd a Chirurgeon of my particular acquaintance to draw tho≈øe parts forcibly together with good bandages; which being well done, I cau≈øed his Hair to be ≈øhorn away, and an a≈øtringent Plai≈øter to be applied, which was almo≈øt like a Rupture-plai≈øter: whereby in three or four weeks, to the admiration of many, my Patient was perfectly healed. This plai≈øter was the <hi>Ceratum ex pelle arietina,</hi> mixt wit Gumm <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> and with a little <hi>Ceratum de Betonica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You mu≈øt al≈øo be provided with good Blood-≈øtaunching remedies. The common ones are, <hi>Bol-armeniac, Sheep-trickles, Blood-≈øtone, Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52336:281"/>
Terra Sigillata, Mill-du≈øt, Hares-hair, Peacocks-dung, &amp;c.</hi> Avoid by all means Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticks, e≈øpecially Sublimat<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Ar≈øenic, Colco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thar; with which you anger a wound, and ca≈øt the Patient into very dangerous ≈øymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms: For, though they may by their corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øivene≈øs at fir≈øt a≈øtringe the wound, yet they do afterwards ≈øo fret and eat it, that you would think, hell-fire were in it. Beware al≈øo of a hot Iron, which many have a refuge to as to a Ma≈øter-piece and the la≈øt remedy.</p>
                     <p>Among the chief A≈øtringents, is <hi>Frog-≈øpawn</hi>; which therefore you are, when 'tis in ≈øea≈øon, to make good provi≈øion of, for the whole year. Take therefore in the Spring a lump of raggs, and dip it into Smiths-water, in which fir≈øt ≈øome crude Allum hath been di≈ø≈øolved. Let this lump be dried again, and then draw it thorough the Spawn of Frogs, ≈øo as that the Spawn may every where hang on it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe it to the Air to dry; and afterwards draw the ≈øame again thorough Frog-≈øpawn: Which repeat as often as you can, during the ≈øea≈øon of Frog-≈øpawn; for the oftner you dip the raggs into it, the more vertue they will receive. This Spawn ≈øtauncheth bleeding, with a good bandage. I have often u≈øed with good ≈øucce≈øs the di≈øtilled water of Frog-≈øpawn in the bleeding of the No≈øe, fir≈øt mixt with crude Allum, and then drawn up into the No≈øtrils. Take a green Frog, burn him in a pipkin, not to a≈øhes, but ≈øo as to be reducible to powder: This powder put into a ≈ømall Taffaty-bagg, and hang it about the neck of a woman that floods exce≈ø≈øively; and ≈øhe will find great help from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52336:282"/>Having often made mention of Allum, which is one of the chief remedies for ≈øtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of blood, I will make publick the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of Allum,</hi> which I have hitherto kept ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Take then of the be≈øt and cleare≈øt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum as much as you plea≈øe; pulveri≈øe it, and put the powder into an Oxe-or Swines-blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, tying it very clo≈øe; Then throw it into a kettle of hot water, and the Allum will be di≈ø≈øolved; this Solution bring over the helm out of a low retort, until the Allum get a <hi>caput mortuum</hi>; then cea≈øe to urge the fire any more, le≈øt you force corro≈øive ≈øpirits from it, which are noxious to our pre≈øent purpo≈øe. This <hi>caput mortuum</hi> put again into a bladder, and di≈ø≈øolve it as before; and do this ≈øo long, until the whole body of your Allum be brought over the helm. But you mu≈øt filter the fir≈øt ≈øolution for fear of any du≈øt or other heterogeneous matter mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>This is the Magi≈øtery of Allum, able to draw the veins together without corro≈øion. Apply this to wounds, or any other bleeding part. You may mix with it Tragacanth, Gummi Arabick, <hi>Sanguis Draconis,</hi> and well-beaten Whites of Eggs.</p>
                     <p>Take good notice, whether the wounded Patient have heated him≈øelf in ≈øtorming a place, or by any other military execution, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be yet di≈øtemper'd by pa≈ø≈øion; for as long as this la≈øts, the blood is in a rage, and can hardly be ≈øtopped. In this ca≈øe ≈øtop the wound with Peacocks dung; and take Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Whites of Eggs well beaten together, a little Allum, and refined Salt-peter<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> put to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52336:282"/>
it as much Frog-≈øpawn, Shepherds-pur≈øe, broad Plantain, or other convenient water, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary; ≈øo that there may be three parts of water and one part of vinegar; dip pledgets into it, and clap them cold to the wound, and the bleeding will cea≈øe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> al≈øo is an excellent ≈øtauncher of blood, to be u≈øed both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. For inwardly it cureth the Bloody Flux and other Fluxes; and outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to wounds and ≈øtrewed into them, it clo≈øeth the veins. But it mu≈øt not be prepared with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or di≈øtilled Vineger, or any corro≈øive thing, but only by the heat of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberating furnace; and afterwards di≈øtil often from it ≈øome proper water, as of <hi>Ro≈øes, Speed-well, Self-heal</hi> or broad <hi>Plantain,</hi> after which preparation it is divers times to pa≈øs again through a reverberating furnace, until it grow as light as a down-feather: And then 'tis fit for our purpo≈øe; for as long as it is ≈øtrong and heavy, the body of it is not throughly opened.</p>
                     <p>Among other things, you may make u≈øe of the Red earth of Vitriol; which is to be thus prepared: Take Vitriol, as much as you plea≈øe, put it in a new ungla≈øed pipkin, into a Potters oven, to deprive it of its moi≈øture, and to reduce it to a <hi>Colcothar</hi>: Then pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veri≈øe this calcined Vitriol, and in a large gla≈øed earthen di≈øh pour hot water on it, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ≈øtand ≈øo for four or five hours; then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant the water, and pour other hot water upon it, as before, repeating this three, four, or five times, until all the ≈øalt be got out of the ≈øaid <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar</hi>;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52336:283"/>
which whether it be done, may ea≈øily be found by the ta≈øte. Then dry this red dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Earth, and it will prove a very good blood-≈øtaunching medicine; which may al≈øo in other ca≈øes be variou≈øly u≈øed; as you'l find it hereafter of great u≈øe in my plai≈øter for wounds made by thru≈øting.</p>
                     <p>The water you had poured on this <hi>Colcothar,</hi> you ought not to throw away as u≈øele≈øs, but to put it by; and, for other occa≈øions, you may boil it away, and it will leave a Salt behind, as white as ≈ønow, with which you may do wonders in foul Sores. I have u≈øed it with good ≈øucce≈øs in ≈øuch ca≈øes; in which it clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth and maketh a firm ground for new and good fle≈øh to grow upon. For, though there be many things, that clean≈øe Sores, yet they leave the fle≈øh loo≈øe and ≈øpungy; but this is both a≈øtringent, and withal maketh ≈øuch a ≈øound and firm bottom, that you may tru≈øt to it: Whence al≈øo it is to be u≈øed in fi≈øtulous Sores.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the ≈øtopping of Blood; take the blood of a Lamb or Sheep, let it ≈øtand in a clean earthen ve≈ø≈øel, until the <hi>≈øerum</hi> be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from it; pour this off, and dry the blood well in a new gla≈øed pipkin, upon hot embers: Then pulveri≈øe it, and mix with it a fourth part of clean pulveri≈øed <hi>Tragacanth,</hi> and ≈øtrew this into the wound. If the i≈ø≈øue of the blood be ≈øo impetuous, that it wa≈øhes away the fir≈øt application, then wipe the wound again, and ≈øtrew into it of the ≈øame powder the ≈øecond time. Putting among≈øt it Allum, <hi>Crocus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> or the red Earth of Vitriol, you will do
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52336:283"/>
well: Bind the wound with the <hi>Empla≈øtrum Santalinum,</hi> (which is called <hi>Incognitum</hi> by our Chirurgeons,) or with the <hi>Ceratum ex pelle arietina,</hi> due to <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The blood being ≈øtopt, and the wound clean≈øed, you mu≈øt then apply good vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Oyls or Wound-bal≈øoms. Oyls are all, as I mention'd above, fatty; whence it is, that they do not ea≈øily con≈øolidate wounds, unle≈øs you put to them ≈øome refined <hi>Ma≈øtic, Sarco-colla, Sanguis Draconis, Sandarach,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>But to open unto you the good affection of my heart, I ≈øhall de≈øcribe here my Wound-bal≈øom, wherewith I have, by Gods a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, done much good, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take as much as you plea≈øe of Turpentine of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which comes from <hi>Venice,</hi> and is taken inwardly; and the ≈øame quantity of the red Oyl of St. <hi>Johns-wort,</hi> di≈ø≈øolve them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Then take Gumm Elemy, di≈ø≈øolve it apart, and pour it among the other; and ≈øo let all cool, and when 'tis half cold, pour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt it a little Oyl of Bees-wax, and your Bal≈øom is prepared. I cannot tell you the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe weight of each ingredient, becau≈øe as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I have prepared it, I have done it by the Eye, and as it ≈øeemed good unto me; only note, that there mu≈øt be ≈øo much of the Gumm Elemy as to give it a due con≈øi≈øtence; which you may try, by ca≈øting a drop or two of it into cold water; this Bal≈øom being to be thinner than an Unguent, and yet thicker than Oyl.</p>
                     <p>This Bal≈øom heals very ≈øpeedily, e≈øpecially
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52336:284"/>
when u≈øed in wounds fre≈øhly inflicted, on fine pledgets, and only with a yellow Tractif bound over it.</p>
                     <p>Be al≈øo provided with good Plai≈øter for wounds made by Thru≈øting, ≈øuch as are the <hi>Opodeldoch</hi> of <hi>Theophra≈øtus,</hi> or the good black Thru≈øt-plai≈øter<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> thus to be prepared: Take of Oyl of Ro≈øes ≈øeven ounces; of <hi>Colophonium,</hi> black Pitch, white Wax, Roman Vitriol, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øe, Frankincen≈øe, Myrrh, <hi>ana</hi> eight ounces; of Ma≈øtic, one ounce of the Oyl of Eggs, two ounces; of Spike-oyl, one ounce; of the Oyl of Juniper-berries, three ounces; of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> two ounces; of white Vitriol and red Corals, <hi>ana</hi> two ounces; of <hi>Heron</hi>-≈øuet, one ounce; of Magnet, two ounces; of well clean≈øed Earth-worms pulveri≈øed and of Camphir, <hi>ana</hi> one ounce: Of all this make a powder <hi>≈øecundum artem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My <hi>Opodeldoch,</hi> that I make u≈øe of, is almo≈øt like this, but that I mix with it the red Earth of the Oyl of Vitriol, above ≈øpoken of in the matter of Blood-≈øtaunching; and add al≈øo to it Turpentine and Gumm <hi>Elemi,</hi> with ≈øome <hi>Tutia, Aloes epatica,</hi> well prepared <hi>Lapis Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaris,</hi> and <hi>Crocus Martis</hi>: And thus the Plai≈øter becomes red and hard, like <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Sealing-wax. I take al≈øo <hi>Gummi Ammoniac, Galbanum</hi> and <hi>Opoponax,</hi> the Oyl of <hi>St. Johns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort</hi> and <hi>Myrrh.</hi> This Plai≈øter draws from the bottom, and reaches deep. A Souldier, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this about him, and, upon occa≈øion, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it only to ≈øome flatne≈øs, there being no need of laying it on a cloth, may thus put it on the wound, taking it off mornings and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52336:284"/>
evenings to wipe it clean; and then working it through again, lay it on as before: And ≈øo he may heal him≈øelf; which when done, let him clean the Plai≈øter, and role it up in a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for another occa≈øion.</p>
                     <p>I have ≈øeen con≈øiderable opperations of Gumm Elemi u≈øed alone, laid on leather, and put upon the thru≈øt; but this wound is then to be kept from falling together.</p>
                     <p>To prevent incidental heat and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wounds, make u≈øe of the Oyl of Ro≈øes, Bol Armeniac, Whites of Eggs and Camphir. But to avoid trouble, you may find ready, in the Apothecary-≈øhops, the <hi>

                     <p>You may with great benefit, and you ought al≈øo, e≈øpecially in the wounds of the Head, provided there be no danger of bleeding, lay over the bandage ≈øome fine raggs moi≈øten'd in wine, and well dried again. This allays the pain, and withall prevents ≈øwelling.</p>
                     <p>And in ca≈øe the wound be ≈øwelled, you may al≈øo to good purpo≈øe make u≈øe of Fomentations made of the herb and flowers of <hi>Mullein, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Egrimony, Cow≈ølips, Camomil, Melilot, Ground-Ivy, red Ro≈øes, Bugle,</hi> and the like: But beware of all hot things, whatever they be. Boil the afore≈øaid herbs or the like in half wine and water; but if the wound be not inflamed, take two parts of wine and one of water. With ≈øuch fomentations I have done much good; among others upon a Fencing-Ma≈øter
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52336:285"/>
of <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> called <hi>Camey≈øen,</hi> who in the publick Fencing-≈øchool received thru≈øts in both his Eyes, in≈øomuch that by rea≈øon of the great ≈øwelling that en≈øued thereupon he lo≈øt all his ≈øight; but by the u≈øe of ≈øuch fomentations, God ble≈ø≈øing the means, I recover'd his ≈øight.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Bone</hi> being broken, ≈øet it carefully, and bind it up ≈øtrongly, having laid upon it <hi>Oxycroceum</hi> or <hi>Empla≈øtrum de pelle Arietina.</hi> You may al≈øo comfort ≈øuch wounds with the like fomentations, as before de≈øcribed.</p>
                     <p>On the bank of the <hi>Rhine</hi> is found a Stone in the gravel, call'd <hi>Lapis ≈øabulo≈øus,</hi> which is ea≈øily reducible to powder: Of this, if you can get it, give to the Patient, who≈øe bone is broken, a drachm to be taken in broath, mornings; of which he will find a very good effect.</p>
                     <p>In the ca≈øe of a Limb wrenched, clap to it <hi>Bran</hi> boiled in wine, ≈øometimes, according to occa≈øion, mixing with it a little Salt, and <hi>Mar≈øhmallows</hi> or red <hi>Hounds-tongue-≈øalve.</hi> If it have happened long ago, then make a pul≈øe of Wheaten-flower, Milk, and the Oyl of <hi>Camomil</hi> or <hi>Mullein</hi>; mixing a little Saffron with it, and clap it on hot.

                     <p>You mu≈øt al≈øo be provided with good Wound-drinks; but they mu≈øt be prepared diver≈øly, according to the ≈øeveral places wounded. Thus in the wounds of the Head, <hi>Betony</hi> challenges the pre-eminence and the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52336:285"/>
greate≈øt quantity of all the Vulnerary Herbs; In the wounds of the Sides, <hi>Carduus Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> claims that right; in the wounds of the Brea≈øt, <hi>Veronica</hi> (or Speedwell) ought to have it; in tho≈øe about the Kidneys, the Herb Strawberry mu≈øt be preferred; in tho≈øe near the Liver, Agrimony will have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, and ≈øo forth. Mean time, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary Herbs to be u≈øed in ≈øuch occa≈øions, are the≈øe; <hi>Sanicle, Winter-green, Ladies-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Speedwell, Orpine, Mugwort, Ground-Ivy, Straw-berry-leaves, Agrimony, St. Johns-wort, Cinquefoil, Bugle, Tormentil, Snakeweed, Avens, Woodrooff,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>You may make an excellent Wound-drink of the≈øe four Ingredients, <hi>viz. Winter-green, Orpine, Mugwort</hi> and <hi>Snakeweed,</hi> boiled in half Wine and Water; but in ca≈øe there be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, Wine is to be forborn, or very little of it to be employed.</p>
                     <p>If any Bone be broken into ≈øplinters, do not pull them out with any violence, but loo≈øen them with a good Ointment of Eggs, keeping the wound open the longer. Nature her ≈øelf will not ≈øuffer any ≈øplinter to remain behind.</p>
                     <p>Now you mu≈øt be ready with ≈øome good thing for Blood coagulated, in ca≈øe any per≈øon ≈øhould have been flung down, ≈øqueezed, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or fallen from a high place.

the weight of about a ducat in Wine, or Chervil-water. Or take a good quantity of <hi>Chervil,</hi> boil it in Meath or Fle≈øh-broath, and let the Patient drink a good draught of it warm, three times a day. Or let him drink a Thimble-full of <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> in Beer, adding a little Butter to it. Or take of <hi>Mumia</hi> half an ounce, or <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> two drachms, of <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Cancrorum</hi> (of which the blew ones, which ≈øometimes fall from Crafi≈øhes whil≈øt alive, are the be≈øt,) three drachms, adding to it a little Licori≈øh and Cinnamon, and ≈øome Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil Roots: Of this pulveri≈øed give every day to the Patient, mornings and evenings, the weight of about half a ducat, and by this means you will expel purulent matter and blood, and bony ≈øplinters, and ≈øometimes even bullets lurking in the fle≈øh; not omitting other good Wound-drinks, and vulnerary Bal≈øoms, Plai≈øters, Ointments and Fomentations. Again, take of the red <hi>Hounds-tongue</hi> Ointment, of the bigne≈øs of a great Walnut, di≈ø≈øolve it in warm Broath; it expels all coagulated blood, e≈øpecially if you mix ≈øome <hi>Sperma Ceti</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>If you have any Thorns, Thi≈øtles, Bullets, Small-≈øhot, or the like, to draw out, where perhaps you cannot reach them with In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then burn live Crafi≈øhes in a new Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, until they be reducible to powder, but burn them not to A≈øhes. This powder mix with Hares-≈øuet, and lay it on, and you will find a good effect. Al≈øo take the Roots of the big <hi>Reed</hi> that grows in Mari≈øhes, dry them to be pulveri≈øed, and mix Virgin-honey with it,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52336:286"/>
and lay it upon the part; and of the ≈øame powder give the Patient to drink, twice a day, the weight of half a ducat in Wine, or in Broath, or in a vulnerary potion, if you have at hand. The fir≈øt of this I learned of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctor <hi>Schleer</hi> of <hi>Con≈øtance.</hi>

                     <p>The Excrement of a <hi>Gander,</hi> being applied, is al≈øo powerful in drawing out Iron. Again, Quince-wine mingled with Vinegar, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ≈øome Saffron and Gun-powder among≈øt it, if you give it to one that hath been ≈øhot, it will do him good. Otherwi≈øe, they make a plai≈øter of the Roots of <hi>Cumfrey, Aron, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody, Juniper,</hi> and dried <hi>Radi≈øhes,</hi> all reduced to powder, and mix it with Hares-≈øuet and grey <hi>Diachylum,</hi> making a thick Ointment of it, and ≈øpreading it over a piece of Hare-skin, and ≈øo laying it on. This is greatly prai≈øed, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ≈øeconded with good Wound-drinks, of which <hi>Ma≈øter-wort</hi> is one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients: But if you have not this at hand, take a <hi>Beet</hi> and boil it in Wine, and lay it warm on the wound. Likewi≈øe young Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, not yet fledge, burnt to powder, and this powder made by <hi>Acetum</hi> of Ro≈øes into a pul≈øe, and laid on, does the ≈øame.</p>
                     <p>You ought al≈øo to be provided for the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novia</hi>: And if you proceed aright with my Wound-bal≈øom above de≈øcribed, and keep the wound warm, you may therewith do much good. Mix with it, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> the red Earth of Vitriol, above di≈øcour≈øed of. This <hi>Synova</hi> is a dangerous thing, and often cau≈øeth almo≈øt intollerable pain, if it be not well handled; the Herb of Straw-berries and its

Juyce have great vertue in this ca≈øe. Some make u≈øe of the White of Eggs, Bol-Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, and the like. The Magi≈øtery of Allum al≈øo belongs hither; for, Allum mixed with Vinegar, and clapp'd on very warm, allays it al≈øo. Elder-blo≈ø≈øoms likewi≈øe, u≈øed every way, are effectual in the ≈øame ca≈øe. Employ al≈øo diligently ≈øuch Defen≈øive-plai≈øters, as are not fatty, becau≈øe fat lays no hold on water.</p>
                     <p>To proceed to Burnings, I know almo≈øt no better Salve for burning than this; Take a <hi>Tench,</hi> or any common-Pond-fi≈øh; fry one or more of them with good Butter, pour the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs upon cold Water in a broad earthen Pan, and you have an excellent Ointment again≈øt Burnings. When, ≈øome years ≈øince, a Powder-Mill was blown up, and the Attendants upon the work ≈øo mi≈øerably burnt, that they looked as if they had been ro≈øted, they were healed with this Ointment, only a little finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Sage</hi> being mixt with it.</p>
                     <p>Cream and Lin≈øeed-oyl mingled together, and raggs moi≈øten'd therein, put upon the burnt part, healeth, though the burning were made with <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi>; for, to my knowledge, a certain Chymi≈øt that had thus burnt all his Arm, was thereby re≈øtored. Or, take Oyl of Elder, or ≈øtale Oyl that hath been long in a burning Lamp; beat half as much, as you take of that, of the Whites of Eggs among≈øt it, and anoint the burnt part therewith. If you can get no Oyl of Elder, take any other cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl, as of <hi>Nymphaea,</hi> (Water-lillies) <hi>Poppy-≈øeeds, Violets</hi> or <hi>Ro≈øes,</hi> or the Oyl of <hi>Poplar-buds,</hi> or of <hi>Mar≈øh-Marigold</hi> Flowers.</p>

                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52336:287"/>If you can have Quince-wine, it marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øly ex≈øtingui≈øhes the burning of any ≈øhot, dipping a Linnen pledget in it, and drawing it through the wound, or left in it, repeating this every twelfth hour. The Juyce or Wine of Quinces mu≈øt be u≈øed as it comes from the fruit, without any mixture of Sugar. This I learn'd from a Nobleman, a great Souldier, of long experience in the Wars of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi>

Likewi≈øe the Ointment of <hi>Calx viva,</hi> which is fir≈øt ≈øix or ≈øeven times to be ≈ølaked and dulcified with pure water, pouring every twelve or ≈øixteen hours fre≈øh water upon it, and decanting the former, ≈øo as to leave al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the <hi>Calx</hi> at the bottom; which is then to be mixed with Oyl of Ro≈øes, or ≈øome other cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl, for an Ointment.</p>
                     <p>If you be well acquainted with <hi>Elder,</hi> and know how to u≈øe it, you may obtain out of it one of the be≈øt Cures of Burnings, e≈øpecially out of its middle rinds. Again, Yolks of Eggs and Lin≈øeed-oyl, equal quantities, mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ≈øpread over the burning, is al≈øo very good. Egg-oyl likewi≈øe u≈øed by it ≈øelf, and Vernice employed by Joyners, do well al≈øo; but the latter of the≈øe two, if it be mixed with Oyl of <hi>Spicanard</hi> or <hi>Petroleum,</hi> is to be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled among≈øt <hi>Lin≈øeed-oyl.</hi>

of Inflammations, and therefore very good to allay <hi>St. Antonies fire</hi>; if you pull its mild green rinds from the ≈øtem, and lay them on, without moi≈øtening them. El≈øe they u≈øe again≈øt the ≈øaid Fire, Flower mixed with the powder of Licorice, to be clapt on with a ragg done over with red <hi>Saunders.</hi> My way is, to take the ≈øhavings of ≈øome fre≈øh and juycy Licorice, and to fry them in new Butter; then to ≈øtrain the Butter from it, and to fry the like fre≈øh Licorice therein, and to ≈øtrain the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from that again; repeating this five or ≈øix times. Among this ≈øtrained Butter I ≈øtir ≈øome pure and fine <hi>Ceru≈øe,</hi> Whites of Eggs and a little Camphire. And with this Ointment I have, by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of God, done much good in the ≈øaid inflammation of <hi>St. Antonies fire</hi>; and the common people do to this very day call this Ointment by no other name than that of Doctor <hi>Minderer</hi>'s <hi>Licorice-Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But to return to the quenching of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>If you can have Milk-cream, mingle it with Cow-dung fre≈øhly made, and ≈øo clap it on; though fre≈øh Cow-dung alone allays burning. <hi>Crafi≈øhes</hi> pounded alive, and fryed in fre≈øh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or in common Suet, the Butter ≈øtrained here from, is al≈øo a good Ointment again≈øt burnings. Un≈øalted Lard, melted by a Wax-candle, or an hot Iron, and dropp'd upon fre≈øh cold water, and then gather'd up from the water, and carefully rubbed from the ≈øame, hath the like operation. Take one of the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyls above-named, and fre≈øh Butter, boil the middle rind of Elder in it, and with a

                     <p>If you be troubled with the <hi>Tooth-ach,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the cold in winter, take the root of <hi>Pyrethrum</hi> (Pellitory of <hi>Spain</hi>) and boil it in Vinegar, and hold this Vinegar warm in your mouth, and it will draw out the phlegm that cau≈øes the pain.

But what you take of this Decoction mu≈øt be often ≈øpit out, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fre≈øh taken into you mouth; of which I have found wonderful Effects.</p>
                     <p>The root of <hi>Heath</hi> boiled together with the ≈øame herb in wine, and laid on is e≈øteem'd to be powerful in drawing out thorns and ≈øplinters.</p>
