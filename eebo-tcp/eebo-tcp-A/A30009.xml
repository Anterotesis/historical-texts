         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

2. The <hi>Persons,</hi> the <hi>Tribes.</hi> Not here and there
a man, but a <hi>multitude,</hi> and not a multitude of men
condemnable as so many <hi>Formalists,</hi> poor ignorant
souls, under low administrations and in the dark, for
their punctual attendance upon <hi>Ordinances;</hi> they
were <hi>the Tribes of the Lord,</hi> all owned as his by a
standing in his Church, very <hi>many</hi> by a place in his
heart; he that doubts this, did never consider how
many thousands of every <hi>Tribe</hi> were <hi>sealed for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of God in their foreheads, (Revel. 7. 4, &amp;c. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
in any Nation, looks best like a Mercy, that
is, like it self, when it bindes up the people of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by <hi>multitudes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Their <hi>Actions, the Tribes go up,</hi> rather indeed
their freedome and liberty, there was no <hi>Lion in the
way,</hi> the Law sent them, &amp; the Magistrate kept them
company: <hi>He went with the multitude to the house of God,</hi>
Psal. 42. 4. <hi>Religion</hi> is then a pure, an unmixed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
when a people can enjoy it, discharged of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances,
and never thrives into a greater bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
then when it <hi>sucks the brests of Kings</hi> Isa. 60. 16.</p>
            <p>4. Their <hi>Ground, to the testimony of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know these words are diversly expounded, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to their interpretation, who reade them <hi>for a
testimony,</hi> and do mean a <hi>testimony</hi> of that peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to Gods commands: twas his ordinance that
hither the <hi>Tribes</hi> should come, and this was witness
enough to Israel, that there was a <hi>jus divinum</hi> in
that solemnity. That <hi>Religion,</hi> or that part of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
will never be able to contribute to a peoples
happiness, that is not able to shew its Pedigree, that
it came down from Heaven; you may by no means
set it down amongst a nations priviledges, if God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47253:6"/>
can say, <hi>I commanded it not, neither came it into my
heart, Ier.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
            <p>5. Their <hi>End, to give thanks unto the name of the
Lord.</hi> A part of Gods worship and service put for
the whole. when a <hi>Religion</hi> is set up for any, except
meerely for religious ends, they much mistake, that
look upon it as any part of a peoples glory. That's
the first ingredient to that peoples happiness, <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Righteousness. There are set thrones of Iudgement,
the thrones of the house of</hi> David. A full provision for
the administration of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and the happiness of
that state and kingdome thankfully acknowledged. In the

                  <item>1. Enjoyment of it for the present, <hi>there

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. The enjoyment of it for the present, <hi>there are
set thrones of Iudgement,</hi> a very amiable and pleasant
prospect, where we see:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Iudgement,</hi> that is, <hi>recta judicatio justi atque in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justi.</hi>
it hath, its true, in Scripture many acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but is here made up of hearing and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
whether the cause depending be <hi>criminal</hi> or
<hi>civil,</hi> as it is also in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 15. and to expound it
(as we must do) into a <hi>blessing, (For the judgement is
not yours, but Gods.)</hi> We are necessitated to interpret
it, Of a <hi>Hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. With <hi>understanding,</hi> both matters of <hi>fact,</hi> and
matter of <hi>Law.</hi> The persons that sate here, <hi>were
wise men and under standing,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 13. and this
was it that qualified them for their <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47253:6"/>
Those people are possessed of a very desirable
priviledge, whose administrators of Law and
Justice, are under characters of Gods own prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
and have not the hearing of causes in the
dark.</p>
            <p>2. With <hi>Patience.</hi> It is hardly <hi>Iudgment,</hi> if it
want deliberation, which is well worth the laying
out upon all concernments, where we can mistake
but once. The reason why the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> dwelt
so long upon causes that were <hi>Capital; Si in capitis
discrimine erraverint, non est corrigendi consilii potestas.</hi>
Loss of life is among those damages that are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of reparation. And even in lower cases, <hi>teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas
judicis</hi> may be, <hi>calamitas innocentis;</hi> hasty sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
may throw misery upon the guiltless; which
<hi>David,</hi> you may be sure, would never put upon the
account of a peoples <hi>happiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. With <hi>both Ears.</hi> There be, you know, cases
in which there may be nothing but <hi>Iustice</hi> in the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
and not a jot in the <hi>desider.</hi> And we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it. Of a <hi>Determining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By <hi>Law.</hi> No <hi>Iudgment</hi> hath any other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
You have nothing to discover offenders by,
but this <hi>glass;</hi> nothing to restrain them with, but
this <hi>bridle;</hi> nothing to smite them withal, but this
<hi>sword.</hi> If <hi>Iudgment</hi> flow from any other spring,<note place="margin">Amos 5. 7.</note> how
easily is it turned into wormwood? and how direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destructive is it to the very end that lawes were
made for? <hi>(cum jus ab uno viro homines non conseque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur,
inventae sunt leges.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic. 2. offic.</note> The <hi>judgement</hi> of God is
according to <hi>Law;</hi> else would he punish where there
is no transgression: so is <hi>Iudgment</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> what
else doth it make amongst that peoples priviledges?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47253:7"/>
2. By <hi>Law,</hi> quietly suffered to speak its own
meaning; which in States and Kingdomes (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
was) professing Religion, can never be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into an opposition to the law of God. Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
its true, is the highest act of the highest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
on earth; yet as it is our interest to know they
have no power, so its our duty to believe they have
no intent, to cross in any one <hi>Iota,</hi> the will of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
if they do, such <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Iudgements</hi> must not
take it amiss, if we be not able to reckon them
amongst the materials of our happiness. For <hi>sin is a
reproach to any people,</hi> Pro. 14. 34. this is <hi>judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Thrones of judgement.</hi> The administration of
Lawes hath from the beginning been allowed its
Ensignes of State and Majesty; Christ himself, when
he is described as a <hi>Iudge,</hi> is represented sitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Throne,</hi> and a glorious train waiting upon him,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31. and all Nations have seen cause to
distinguish their magistrates, especially when in
the exercise of their Office, by some or other mark
of state and dignity, from other men; that <hi>Rods, Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Lictors, Gowns, Maces, Swords, Trumpets</hi> and the
like, might bespeak that fear and reverence of the
people, which all authority must endeavour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
and nourish in that great and many-headed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or resolve to be trampled upon. When <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency</hi>
shall be allowed its gallantry, and justice
shall sneak up and down in a despised posture, and
a vulgar Equipage; it may perhaps bespeak a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>thrifty,</hi> but by no means <hi>happy.</hi> Here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are <hi>thrones</hi>

            <p>3. <hi>Are set.</hi> The margin tells us that the <hi>Original</hi>

The like expression you have in <hi>Dan. 7. 26. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <note place="margin">Aug. in. loc.</note> And yet it is not the <hi>judgment</hi> that

tis a strange, a wonderful <hi>riddle.</hi> Be it so,
yet it is doubtless a duty to expound it the
<hi>duty,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Of the <hi>Iudges. Iudgment</hi> is mentioned, and
<hi>Iudges</hi> are meant. Is it not to remember them, that
<hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> should not be accounted amongst
their <hi>accidents,</hi> which may be present or absent,
without the destruction of their <hi>subjects;</hi> but should
be lookt upon as their very <hi>forme,</hi> bestowing upon
them both their <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>denomination?</hi> ... the
duty</p>
            <p>2. Of the <hi>judgement.</hi> To <hi>sit</hi> is a posture of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posedness.
When <hi>judgments</hi> are not calm, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
digested, this part of the <hi>Text</hi> may (for all
them) be a <hi>riddle</hi> still.</p>
            <p>But let's suppose the <hi>Active</hi> to be put for the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,</hi>
and that <hi>Thrones are set;</hi> yet this doth <hi>David</hi>
look upon as a happiness, that the Kingdome was in
a posture of executing <hi>judgment:</hi> 'twas so <hi>protempore,</hi>
and even that is a mercy fit to be acknowledged.
Blessings from <hi>hand</hi> to <hi>mouth</hi> are blessings, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to thankfulness. But here is withal,</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Settlement</hi> of it for the future, <hi>the thrones
of the house of David.</hi> Thrones of judgement there
were before; but by the injury of the times often
interrupted, alwaies changeable: but God had
built <hi>David a sure house, (1. Reg.</hi> 11. 38.) Settled
him the <hi>supreme</hi> magistrate over that people; they
might now know upon what to bottome, and where
to seek for the administration of <hi>justice.</hi> Civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47253:8"/>
is a Nations blessing; the settlement of it
is the addition of another, or a very merciful aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of the former. As such God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
it, (1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. 14.) as such (in the <hi>Text</hi>) doth
<hi>David</hi> acknowledge it; and so will every body else
that believeth <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 28. 2. <hi>For the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of a Land many are the princes thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so you have a short view of the particulars in
the <hi>Text,</hi> the matter of <hi>Davids joy,</hi> and his peoples
happiness; a full provision for <hi>Religion,</hi> vers. 4. and
for the administration of <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi>
vers. 5, And because I may not attempt to prosecute
them in all their branches, I must deale in grose, and
wrap up as much of both verses as I can, in this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
or <hi>point of</hi> Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The condition of a people is then happy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>Which I shall indeavour to make out, from 1.
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and 2. <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> I shall reduce to these—4 <hi>Ranks
.. viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. These two, <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>righteousness,</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
as a peoples <hi>Happiness,</hi> that God <hi>will set his
Tabernacle among them</hi> Lev. 26. 11. and <hi>his Sanctuary

the exercise of <hi>religion.</hi> That <hi>he will restore their

Isa. 1. 26. reduce them to their <hi>primitive</hi>
institution; of the same <hi>Character</hi> they first were,
when they came out of Gods own hand, all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for the administration of <hi>Iustice.</hi> That <hi>he will
make their Officers peace, and their Exactors righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.

Esa.</hi> 60. 17. When the troubles of a People

            <p>2. When God would deale with a people in

should not live. Ezek.</hi> 20. 25. That by <hi>Statutes</hi> and
<hi>Iudgements,</hi> are meant Lawes and Rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in one kinde or other, is too plaine to be stood
upon. Of the <hi>Morall,</hi> or <hi>Iudiciall</hi> Laws of God, none
(I think) wil adventure to expound them. Of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial,</hi>
some have, &amp; to make the <hi>Epithet</hi> here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

so must be <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>judgements, i. e.</hi> the Lawes,
Government, Rites, and Customes of men, whom
God set over them, or delivered them in his wrath.
So there will be no question, why these <hi>Statutes</hi> are
sayd not to be <hi>good,</hi> and but a little why these <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
such <hi>whereby they should not live;</hi> after we
have considered, how often in Scripture, <hi>To live</hi>
is put to signifie, not simply life, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
accommodations of it, amongst which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for our <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>civill</hi> Concernments, is
of the first magnitude. This the Lord in this sad

            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Happinesse</hi> of a people is described by
these <hi>Two. What Nation is there so great that hath sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and judgments so righteous, as all that Law which
I set before you this day? Deut.</hi> 4. 8. It is an Appeale
to the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> whether God had dealt out
happinesse to any other Nation, at the Rate that
he had to them? and the instance is in their <hi>Statutes</hi>
and <hi>judgements,</hi> the provision they had for <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>righteousnesse, Statutes</hi> being Lawes for a people
under a sacred consideration, and <hi>judgments</hi> under a
