            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE City in their Unanimous Choice of their Supream Magiſtrate, have put the <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Scales</hi> into ſo tryed a Hand, already ſo fam'd for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, that Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Advancement to the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Chair, is no more than the Lawrel to the Conqueror; all the Heroick Bravery, and every Meriting Virtue that won thoſe Bays were all his own before.</p>
            <p>Never was this Honour more Deſerved, or leſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted than by Your Lordſhip. The Popular Torrent of an Univerſal Eſteem and Veneration carried their Darling Choice to the Chair. Yes, Sir, it was their common Oblation of Gratitude: They owed it, and they paid it You. In which Honourable Dignity they Crown'd Your Virtues, not Your Ambition. And to compleat that truly Excellent, that Prideleſs Character, ſo wholly Your own; all the private Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction Your Lordſhip ſhall receive from that Illuſtrious Adminiſtration, will be Your Glory of Serving the City, not that of Commanding it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36937:4"/>
And indeed that which has attracted Your Lordſhip ſo general a Love and Reſpect, is, that <hi>Moderation</hi> that has always governed through the whole Conduct of Your Life. Your Lordſhip, with a true Judgment, and right Reaſon, has ever eſteemed Opinion and Faith to lie only before a Higher Tribunal, and conſequently to be only Anſwerable there. Under the Guidance therefore of that <hi>Golden Mean,</hi> not Byaſt or Warpt by Favour or Prejudice, an Aſſent with You never heighten'd Your Smiles, nor a Diſſent from You ever leſſen'd 'em. No, the Difference of Perſuaſion that has ſo often diſturb'd whole Families, and even ſhaken States, never concerned Your Lordſhip. No, my Lord, Humanity and Common Right have ever been adjudged by Your Lordſhip the only Arbitrators in Humane Society. And therefore with a Juſtice without Severity, and a Mercy without Fondneſs or Partiality, Your Lordſhip has ever held the Ballance upright and even to all Mankind. 'Tis with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Unchangeable Principle the Chair finds You, and the World ſhall leave You. This Due all Tongues have ever paid You, and my Pen only writes after 'em, being,</p>

               </gap>n So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: However, your Fair Records keep a Long Roll of Honour among you, when you number no leſs than twenty Lord Mayors of your own.</p>
            <p>But tho', 'tis true, the Collar of SS, that Honorary Ornament for a Year, has not ſo lately ſhined among you; however 'tis not ſo long ſince you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Honour that will ſhine Ages, a more Laſting Monument of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdaſhers</hi> Glory: A Pile of that Illuſtrious Charity (Charity of all Honour the Brighteſt) that we need take but a very ſhort Walk to ſee as fair a Structure for another Inſcription of a <hi>Deo Dante dedit Robert Aske Armig.</hi> as that of <hi>Thomas Sutton;</hi> whilst a <hi>Hoxton</hi> Foundation may even bear Head, and write Siſter with a <hi>Chartreux</hi> one.</p>
            <p>But indeed 'tis not a ſingle Glory of that kind that has thus ſhined among you. The Charitable Donation of Eighteen Thouſand Pounds from one of your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (a pretty round Sum in thoſe early Days) deſerves a very large Page in the <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Regiſter of Fame. And really the Doners of Charity are the only Men (to ſay Truth) that pay their Debts before they die. They owe all their Riches to the Smiles of <hi>Heaven;</hi> and in the Proviſion for <hi>Fed Mouths</hi> and <hi>Cloath'd Backs,</hi> they pay it all Back to <hi>Heav'n</hi> again.</p>
            <p>For one yet Additional Honour more to your Company, 'tis a Numerous one. So large a Body of you ſeems to ſay, you have ſome extraordinary Attractions of <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to invite and draw ſo General a <hi>Conflux</hi> to you. And to make it yet larger ſtill, we muſt conſider you as a very ſpreading <hi>Root,</hi> when no leſs than the whole Foundation of ſo Eminent a Society as the <hi>Merchant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers</hi> were Originally a <hi>Branch</hi> of You.</p>
