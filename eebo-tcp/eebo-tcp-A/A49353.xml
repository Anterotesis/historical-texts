            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Loyal Martyr VINDICATED.</head>
            <p>AFTER Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s Paper had been shewn by the Sheriff to those that sit at the Helm, and that it was known there were more Copies of it given abroad, so that it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to sham or disguise it, it raised in them (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) very sollicitous Apprehensions what Effects it was likely to work in the Minds of all the true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to see a genuine Member of that Communion, with his last Breath, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish his prevaricating Brethren of the enormous Crimes of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> in which they they had of late so deeply plunged themselves; denounce Prophetically to them the Judgments attending their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy, if not timely repented of; profess so stoutly his Allegiance to his much injured and unjustly Dispossessed Prince; seal our Church's Doctrine of <hi>Non-resistance</hi> with his dearest Blood, and dye so resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, chearfully, nay joyfully, in Testimony of that Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; could not but be apprehended to our Statis's to be the most powerful Motives imaginable, to <hi>reclaim</hi> those who had been <hi>misled</hi> by false Information, or seduced by Interest into a Repentance of their Errors; and to <hi>establish</hi> the rest in the Loyal Principles to which they had hitherto <hi>adhered.</hi> Besides, the honest unaffected Reason, which appears in the Account he gives of his Tenets, and Conscientious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and the Christian Moderation and sincere Piety, which he observed throughout his whole Paper, Praying heartily for his very Enemies, though unjustly thirsting after his Blood, (the proper Temper
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109147:2"/>
of a dying Martyr,) could not but <hi>recommend</hi> the Contents of it to the <hi>esteem</hi> of every <hi>indifferent</hi> Reader, and even be able to <hi>shock</hi> all such as were not <hi>resolutely byass'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can I blame them for being so highly concerned, that such a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy was left to the <hi>Loyal Party.</hi> Those politick Men were well aware of the successful Methods by which Christianity was <hi>Propagated</hi> at first, and that <hi>The Blood of the Martyrs was the Seed of the Church</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they judged it very Expedient, that some speedy and effectual Means should be taken to stop the prejudicial Effects, which it would otherwise produce. It was then thought the best way to seem to <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>undervalue</hi> the Paper, by Printing it <hi>themselves,</hi> and at the same time to endeavour to baffle and confute it by an Answer going along with it, penned with as much plausibleness as the Cause could bear: But Truth is not easily trampled down. His <hi>Christian Constancy</hi> has made too great an Impression in the Hearts of his Admirers, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his <hi>Meritorious Sufferings</hi> to lie under the Scandal of a <hi>Treasonable Guilt</hi>; and has given Courage to some of the meanest of them to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his <hi>Cause,</hi> and <hi>Credit,</hi> against the <hi>wicked Slanders</hi> and <hi>weak Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> of this mercenary Writer; though he foresees that if they be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, they can expect no other Reward but the same fatal End. The <hi>Holland Lyon</hi> has begun to taste <hi>English Blood,</hi> and finds it so sweet that it draws on an Appetite of shedding still more.</p>
            <p>To fall then to our Reply—</p>
            <p>His First Sham (for the whole Piece is a continu'd fardle of such Stuff) is, That the Paper is none of Mr. <hi>Ashton's.</hi> This, if made good, would (they hoped) take off the Authority and Influence of it, as no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being the <hi>proper</hi> Act of the <hi>Martyr,</hi> but of some <hi>other</hi> of that Party <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it required therefore his best skill to make this Credible. Let us then examine his Arguments: His First Proof is, Because <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> with too much Art and Care to be the Work of one, who professes he thought it better to employ his last minutes in Devotion,</hi> (p. 8.) What a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Cavil is this! His <hi>last minutes</hi> were at the place of Execution which the Martyr professeth he thought it better to employ in <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holy Communion with his God,</hi> than in making <hi>Speeches</hi>; which if they were <hi>Loyal,</hi> and delivered his Thoughts <hi>fully,</hi> were likely to be interrupted, and so <hi>not attended with the designed Success</hi>; and therefore he chose rather to deliver what he had to say in <hi>Writing.</hi> Now comes this Gentleman, and pretends (if his Words have any Tenour or Sense in them) that he must have compos'd this Paper of his <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his last mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi> that is, <hi>at the Gallows</hi>; which, he says, he could not do with so much <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> those minutes being taken up <hi>otherwise,</hi> viz. In <hi>Devotion</hi>; and therefore (forsooth) the Paper is none of his: As if he had not time enough between his Sentence and the Execution of it to compose a Paper, both larger, and more full of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> (had he minded such Advantages) than this was: Or, as if good Men, whose <hi>Piety</hi> enclines them to spend their last minutes in <hi>holy Thoughts,</hi> could not in the time <hi>anteceding</hi> use both their best <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> to pen a true Account of their Principles, and the Cause for which they Suffered; but indeed there is <hi>little</hi> Art or Care in the <hi>Master,</hi> or <hi>Sense</hi> of the Paper, but a plain and candid Discovery of his Thoughts and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109147:2"/>
both towards God, and the World; and as for the <hi>manner</hi> of Writing it (<hi>if it were indeed such as this Man exhibits it</hi>) there was neither any the <hi>least Art</hi> or <hi>Care</hi> shewn in it, but perfect <hi>Negligence,</hi> or rather great <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> throughout the whole, as will be seen shortly.</p>
            <p>His Second Reason to prove the Paper was not the Martyr's, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>Ashton,</hi> says he, was <hi>illiterate</hi> and <hi>unskilled in the Law,</hi> and yet uses such Bug-words, as <hi>Impending, Prevaricating, Premisses,</hi> and <hi>Consequence</hi>; and <hi>gives such a peremptory Iudgment about the Laws of the Realm, in a Case acknowledged by all ingenious Men of his own Party to have a great deal of difficulty in it</hi>; this Man will say any thing, though never so openly false: Not <hi>one M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> of his Party ever thought there was the least difficulty in this, That it was Treason by our Laws to resist a <hi>legal Prince,</hi> or acknowledge any other for <hi>King while he lives.</hi> No not this Writer himself, as appears by his not thinking it his best play to alledge the <hi>Laws of the Realm,</hi> bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> flying off and recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the <hi>Law of Nations</hi>: And as for the Law as it relates to his <hi>own</hi> Case, he was far from <hi>Peremptory,</hi> as is manifest from his saying—<hi>I am told I am the First Man that ever was condemned for High-Treason upon bare Presumption or Suspicion</hi>: Do not these Words [<hi>I am told</hi>] sound as <hi>modestly</hi> as is possible, and bar all shew of his passing such a <hi>peremptory Iudgment about the Laws of the Realm,</hi> as he puts upon him <hi>p.</hi> 8? What will not this Caviller say? But 'tis pleasant to observe what Prancks he uses all along. 'Tis plain Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> meant no more but that he was <hi>illiterate</hi> (that is, unlearned) and <hi>unskilful in the Law,</hi> as appears by his desiring the <hi>Iudges</hi> to observe for <hi>him</hi> what might be for his Advantage. And sure a Man who has not <hi>made the Law his Study,</hi> (for the Word reaches no farther,) may have Learning enough to use those Four ordinary Words, none of them being artificial <hi>Law Terms</hi>; but such honest English as every Gentleman, that converses with Persons above the lowest Rank, is capable of understanding and using. But this
candid Gentleman seeing his Cause could not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but by Tricks, (for this whole turn of Government was nothing but a <hi>Trick of Policy,</hi>) disjoyns by his Discourse [<hi>illiterate</hi>] from [<hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skill'd in the Law</hi>] and refers the Four cramp Words to the <hi>former,</hi> and his passing a <hi>peremptory Iudgment about our Laws</hi> to the <hi>latter</hi>; and when he has done, he tells us very sadly, <hi>one may justly wonder at it</hi>; and indeed it is very wonderful: For to play <hi>so many</hi> jugling Tricks in so <hi>little</hi> room, wresting almost every Word 'till he has made it <hi>crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; and then gracing every Flam he gives us with such a <hi>demure Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,</hi> is altogether <hi>Monstrous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 9. That the <hi>Loyal Martyr</hi> design'd two Things. To <hi>assert his Principles,</hi> and to <hi>testifie his Innocency</hi>; and he sets himself to prove that he did <hi>neither.</hi> As for the former, he grants that <hi>by the Faith of the Church of</hi> England <hi>Mr.</hi> Ashton <hi>meant the Doctrine of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience</hi>; and then <hi>confutes</hi> him most learnedly, by telling us, That <hi>he suffered not for Passive Obedience but for want of it,</hi> and that <hi>had he regulated his Life by this Principle he had preserved it.</hi> Did ever any Man's Reason turn tail so aukwardly? The constant Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was Passive Obedience to a <hi>lawful King</hi>; and he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109147:3"/>
is the lawful King according to the Constitution of our Government, who has Title to it by <hi>immediate Succession.</hi> Now comes this acute Gentleman, and pretends, without Shame or Wit, that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not Passive Obedience to the <hi>legal King,</hi> whom all the World did ever acknowledge for <hi>such,</hi> in their <hi>clear, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(to engratiate themselves by out-bidding the others) full thrice as much as the Dissenters had done; so that the Nation was half begger'd by his Transporting it beyond Sea, to <hi>hire</hi> Foreign Soldiers, and <hi>bribe</hi> the Confederates; and yet though they thus pleasured him by lavishing away the <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Riches</hi> of the Nation, all the Title he could obtain of them unanimously, was to be only King <hi>de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Iure.</hi> Which encouraged Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> who stood watching, his Advantage, to face about and build: this <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> Title upon the <hi>Events of Providence,</hi> or (to use an Expression less blasphemous and more <hi>proper</hi> for a <hi>Rueling</hi> Authority) on the <hi>Wheel of Fortune.</hi> But the poor Man was so baffled for this new Notion of his, particularly by the Author of the <hi>Trimming Court Divine,</hi> and more largely and unanswerably by those two learned and acute Treatises, Entituled, [<hi>The Duty of Allegiance settled upon its true Grounds, according to Scripture, Reason, and the Opinion of the Church,</hi> and by Dr. <hi>Sherlock's Case of Allegiance considered with some Remarks upon his Vindication</hi>;] that 'tis his best play to sit down with <hi>silence,</hi> and be content to <hi>lull</hi> his Conscience with his Deanry, without <hi>awaking</hi> or <hi>disquieting</hi> it by thinking <hi>how</hi> to answer them, lest it start up in his Face, and disturb his peaceful and comfortable Enjoyments of his new Acquisitions; for I dare challenge him, particularly in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the two latter of those three Treatises; that he is so shamefully, confuted that he has not one starting-hole left for his Credit to escape by. And yet I must tell him, That unless he answers them <hi>fully,</hi> he <hi>Cheats</hi> the Government, and is bound in Conscience to make <hi>Restitution</hi> of his Deanry; For why should he be so bountifully paid for <hi>weaving</hi> a Piece, which, when it comes to be well lookt into, is so full of <hi>Bracks, Stains,</hi> and <hi>Holes,</hi> that 'tis useless and good for nothing?</p>
            <p>Thus the Fourth Title of a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> by the <hi>Wheel of Fortune,</hi> was <hi>laid flat,</hi> and the <hi>Vnsteady</hi> Authority of our new Governours was bandied most miserably from Post to Pillar, and could find no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fix upon, nor any <hi>Basis</hi> that would <hi>fit</hi> it. None had hitherto been so Hardy to offer to maintain <hi>by Reason,</hi> that they were <hi>rightfull</hi> and <hi>lawfull</hi> King and Queen: Yet I am credibly informed that a certain Gloomy-look't Divine, relying, I suppose, on some mystick Exposition of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> had preached a Sermon which would insinuate that King <hi>William</hi> had a Right to <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Conquest</hi>; which was formerly ready to be published, but upon the taking of <hi>Mons</hi> some s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>op was put to it at that time. If this be as true as it is told me, with much assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we English-men have reason to bless God for that Success of the French King, as the most beneficial <hi>Event of Providence</hi> that has befall'n us this long time; for had that Project been heartily encouraged, our Countrey-men had been all <hi>Slaves,</hi> and every Farthing in the Nation at the <hi>Conquerour's</hi> Devotion, it being indeed, in <hi>that Case, his own</hi>; so that when Parliaments would <hi>give no more,</hi> he might, by setting up his Title, when he pleased, <hi>take all</hi>; and this was the <hi>Fifth Title</hi> which has been set on foot.</p>
            <p>At length comes this Gentleman, and seeing all the other Titles to be but impertinent <hi>Shifts,</hi> and not at all likely to take, he will needs strain a Note above <hi>Ela,</hi> and settle it on a <hi>higher</hi> Foundation; <hi>viz.</hi> on <hi>the Law of Nations,</hi> which allows <hi>Independent Governments to right them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109147:5"/>
by Force,</hi> or by making <hi>War</hi> on him that <hi>injures</hi> them: But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw no <hi>War</hi> was made, no <hi>Army</hi> fought, nor a <hi>Stroke</hi> struck <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> so that none who was not mad with Revelation could dream of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> giving him <hi>Right</hi> over <hi>England</hi>; he very politickly twists with it— and with the <hi>Success</hi> of this <hi>Iust War,</hi> (p. 11.) <hi>the Consent of the People</hi> too. This, I must confess, is a more extraordinary and more refined Notion than any of the other, 'tis made of Contradictions, and is of a Composition altogether Monstrous. We use to instance in <hi>Chimeras</hi> by a <hi>Hirco-cervus</hi> (a Goat-Stag) or some such whimsical Conceit, that imports two or more <hi>different</hi> Natures clapt together. But this new fangled Notion of Right, he has invented, consists not of merely <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> but <hi>opposite</hi> Natures; <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> signifie <hi>Involuntariness</hi> in those they are exercised upon, and <hi>Consent</hi> signifies <hi>Voluntariness.</hi> Again, the Effect of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> is to <hi>subdue Resisters,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of the whole <hi>Nation</hi> signifies <hi>no Resisters</hi> at all. So that to come in by <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and at the same time by <hi>Consent,</hi> is to be <hi>beaten voluntarily,</hi> to be <hi>forced willingly,</hi> to <hi>resist yieldingly,</hi> to <hi>submit withall our Hearts, yet against our Will,</hi> or whatever Nonsense of this kind this <hi>incoherent</hi> and <hi>self-divided</hi> Notion of Right affords us. But, to say the Truth, there was neither a fair <hi>War,</hi> subduing the resisting Nation <hi>against</hi> their Consent, nor a clear, free, and deliberate Consent of the <hi>whole</hi> Nation; but (as will shortly appear) a mere <hi>Trick,</hi> manag'd by an Ambitious Invader, and his Confederates, seconded by a Party of <hi>Male-contents</hi> and <hi>Rebellious Deserters,</hi> and carried on by a complicated <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>unproved Pretences,</hi> and <hi>Forgeries,</hi> to <hi>bubble</hi> and <hi>fool</hi> the Common People, and bring us into the Slavery and Beggary we now groan under.</p>
            <p>We will put this young new-hatcht Kingly-Title its best Cloaths on, and then see how finely the Royal Robes <hi>become</hi> it, and how <hi>prettily</hi> the Baby will look.</p>
            <p>There is besides the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> (says he, p. 11.) a <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> by which Sovereign <hi>Independent-Governments,</hi> when injured, may <hi>Right</hi> themselves by a <hi>Iust War.</hi> Here were <hi>great and violent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions of an injury to the Right of Succession,</hi> and <hi>too great Evidence</hi> of a formed <hi>Design to subvert the Establisht Religion and Civil Liberties of the Nation,</hi> and this <hi>War</hi> had <hi>Success</hi>; therefore the Sovereignty was duely <hi>transferred,</hi> and so <hi>there can be no dispute left to whom our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance is due.</hi> This is the full substance of the Discourse he had put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as he told us (<hi>p.</hi> 10.) <hi>to clear this whole Matter.</hi> Let us now take it gently to pieces, and lay each part of it down easily, lest it fall asunder of <hi>it self,</hi> and shatter into <hi>Incoherent</hi> Atoms before we come to handle it closely.</p>

For surely he will not say that King <hi>Iames</hi> had done Wrong to the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> or that the Person of King <hi>William alone,</hi> or of his Queen either, is a <hi>Nation</hi>: Yet one of the two he must say, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those of our Church who were heartily Loyal, did grieve exceedingly to see him give his Enemies <hi>too fair</hi> occasions to work him Mischief: They judged that the setting up the High Commission Court over Ecclesiasticks, were there nothing in it but the Novelty of it, should not have been attempted in such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances <hi>if at all.</hi> The making one of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> (Men more odious to our Nation than <hi>Turkish M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They conceived that the <hi>Dispensing</hi> with the <hi>Test,</hi> and putting Roman-Catholicks promiscuously into Offices Civil and Military, might have been let alone 'till the <hi>Test</hi> it self were Abrogated; which would certainly have been more easily obtained, had not this forward Anticipation put our Church of <hi>England</hi> out of humour, and made them more warily stand upon their Guard, and resolve unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously to part with nothing that could any way he likely to advantage them: But that which most <hi>Startled</hi> our Church, was the Design of giving Liberty of Conscience to all Dissenters; they had sadly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in the long Parliament's Time, and in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days, how those Men had trampled the Church of <hi>England</hi> under Foot, and they feared that this setling them by Law, on an <hi>even level</hi> with themselves, might in time give those restless Men opportunity to play the same Franks over again.

            <p>On the other side, King <hi>Iames</hi> was very earnest to have a <hi>general Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience</hi> setled by Law. It had ever been his Tenet, that Persecution purely for Conscience sake was <hi>Vnchristian</hi>: Besides, he judged it would <hi>enrich</hi> the <hi>Nation,</hi> as it had done <hi>Holland,</hi> by inviteing Strangers hither, and encouraging Trade; the conveniency of our Ports, above those of our Neighbours, being an efficacious Motive to draw the Traffick from <hi>them</hi> to <hi>us.</hi> He judged too that this universal Toleration, if wisely setled and managed, might be a means to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Bedlam Animosities here about Religion, which had so often distracted the Nation, and, within our Memory, turned the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment topsie-turvy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor was it one of his <hi>least</hi> Motives (though not the <hi>only</hi> one, as some apprehended) to gain those of his own Religion a Toleration among the rest of the Dissenters; a thing (to speak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially)

            <p>As for what King <hi>Iames</hi> is pretended to have done in prejudice of our <hi>Civil Liberties,</hi> which required the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s over-chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vindicating them: He was told by his Judges that it was his <hi>due Prerogative</hi>; and suppose he had something extended <hi>that,</hi> why should this oblige a <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Daughter</hi> to invade a <hi>Father</hi>?

            </p>
            <p>Again: If King <hi>Iames</hi> over-reach'd, it was in order to get Universal Liberty of Conscience settled by Law, which suiting so exactly with the Dutch Methods could not, to a Dutch Prince, be a <hi>just Ground</hi> for such an <hi>Vnnatural Quarrel</hi>; especially since it was intended to take the Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Yoke of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Laws from off the Necks of those of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Persuasion; which being the Religion that Prince had espoused, and been bred up in, it ought rather to have <hi>obliged</hi> him, than have <hi>exasperated</hi> him so highly as to draw his Sword at his <hi>Father.</hi> This Prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet though their own Party was so great, and had all those Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to back them, they were able to carry it but by a very few Votes, as appears by the Catalogues of each. And which gives a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Blemish in the House of Lords, than it had Advantage in the House

of Commons, Six Dukes, and Thirty Lords <hi>protested</hi> solemnly against it, and their Protestations stand yet upon <hi>Record</hi>: And the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the others admitted it, because they judged it would be a Ruine to themselves, and withall worse for King <hi>Iames,</hi> if the Government should settle into a Common-wealth, than if they should keep up Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, by setting up a King <hi>de Facto</hi> at present, which is all they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at first, as divers of them have declared privately to those Friends they durst trust; though now they are carried down by the Current of the Times into many Treasonable Actions, contrary to their first Intentions. So dangerous is it to <hi>recede</hi> from <hi>Principles,</hi> in Compliance with any <hi>present Circumstances</hi> whatever.</p>
            <p>Seeing then all this whole Turn of our State depends upon the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication Vote,</hi> as on its <hi>Bottom</hi> and sole Foundation, and no King was chosen, but in <hi>Supposition</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Relinquishing, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary divesting himself of his Crown, it follows, that the <hi>True Ground</hi> of King <hi>William</hi>'s <hi>Right to the Government,</hi> is a piece of <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To prevent so great Mischief, and to take away, not only all just Causes, but even pretences of Discontent, We freely and of Our own accord redressed all those Things that were set forth as the Causes of that Invasion: And that We might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Counsel and Advice of Our Subjects themselves, which way We might give them a further and a full Satisfaction, We resolved to meet them in a Free Parliament; and in order to it, We first laid the Foundation of such a Free Parliament, in restoring the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the rest of the Corporations to their ancient Charters and Priviledges; and afterwards actually appointed the Writs to be issued out, for the Parliament's Meeting on the Fifteenth of <hi>Ianuary:</hi> But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>

Aspersion on Me, that Malice could invent, in that Clause of it which concerns <hi>My Son</hi>? I appeal to all that know Me, <hi>nay, even to himself,</hi> that in their Consciences, <hi>neither he nor they,</hi> can believe Me, in the least, capable of so <hi>Vnnatural a Villany,</hi> nor of so little common Sense to be imposed upon, <hi>in a Thing of such a nature as that:</hi> What had I then to expect from one, who by all Arts hath taken such pains to make Me appear <hi>as black as Hell to My own People,</hi> as well as to all the World <hi>besides</hi>? What Effect that had at Home all Mankind have seen, by so general a <hi>Defection</hi> in My Army, as well as in the Nation, amongst all sorts of People.</p>
                  <p>I was born Free, and desire to continue so; and though I have <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured My Life very frankly,</hi> on several occasions, for the <hi>Good and Honor of My Countrey,</hi> and am as free to do it again, <hi>(and which I hope I shall yet do, as Old as I am, to redeem it from the Slavery it is like to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,)</hi> yet I think it not convenient to expose My Self to be Secured, as not to be at Liberty to effect it; and for that Reason <hi>do withdraw,</hi> but so as to be within Call, whensoever the Nations Eyes shall be opened, so as to see how they have been <hi>Abused and Imposed upon</hi> by the specious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion and Property. I hope it will please God to touch their Hearts, out of his infinite Mercy, and to make them sensible of the ill Condition they are in, and bring them to such a Temper, <hi>That a legal Parliament may be called</hi>; and that amongst other Things, which may be necessary to be done, they will agree to Liberty of Conscience for <hi>all Protestant Dissenters</hi>; and that those of My own Persuasion may be so <hi>far considered,</hi> and have such a share of it, as they may live Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and Quietly, as <hi>English-men and Christians ought to do,</hi> and not to be obliged to transplant themselves, which would be very grievous, especially to such as love their <hi>own Countrey:</hi> And I appeal to all Men, <hi>who are Considering Men,</hi> and have had Experience, Whether any thing can make this Nation so Great and Flourishing, as Liberty of Conscience? Some of Our Neighbours dread it.</p>

            <p>Thus much for his new Coined Notion of <hi>Right by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> own'd by <hi>none</hi> but this singular Writer, who seeing <hi>all</hi> other Titles of this upstart Government <hi>baffled,</hi> was forc'd, for a shift, to recurr to this Whimsie. But since he was pleased to decline the Law of the Land, and run to a <hi>Superior Law,</hi> (viz.) that of <hi>Nations,</hi> we shall take leave to mind him (for He and his Party seem to have quite <hi>forgot</hi> it, or rather indeed to <hi>out-brave,</hi> and <hi>laugh</hi> at it) of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Law of all,</hi> the <hi>Law of God,</hi> which commands us to <hi>Honour our, Father and Mother,</hi> and not to <hi>covet,</hi> much less to <hi>rob</hi> or <hi>cheat</hi> another; and least of all so near, and so <hi>Revered a Relation,</hi> of what is <hi>rightfully</hi> his. Let us consider then what Good and Conscientious Christians would have done in the Case of the Prince, and Princess of <hi>Orange.</hi> For, First, If their Party, with their Consent or Connivance, invented those Stories, which he makes the <hi>just Occasion of the War,</hi> on purpose to turn out their Father, it was in many regards the most hideous, and the most villanous Injustice that can be imagin'd. Secondly, If those Falshoods were suggested to them by <hi>others,</hi> they knew the <hi>Genius</hi> of the English Subjects was apt to <hi>raise</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> the most Senseless Falshoods of him out of hatred to his <hi>Religion</hi>; and so they ought to have considered, that there was <hi>no</hi> kind of Evidence of this Story, nor so much as <hi>one</hi> Witness, that the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was a Counterfeit, nor (as appears by their <hi>not producing</hi> it in their Justification when it was so necessary) <hi>any one</hi> tolerable <hi>Reason,</hi> able to persuade a prudent Man, the Thing was <hi>true</hi>: Whereas, on the other side there were, as was said, near Fifty Sworn Witnesses of clear Honour and Reputation testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the contrary, any Two or Three of whom were sufficient to carry the greatest Estate, or take away the Life of any Man in <hi>England.</hi> They knew too, that if the <hi>pretended</hi> Injury done to them were not <hi>really true,</hi> they must incurr the dreadful Indignation of a just God, for breaking divers of his Commandments, in that one Action, by <hi>Dishon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring, Injuring,</hi> and <hi>Slandering</hi> their <hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>near Related</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; And who would hazard their Soul upon such odds? Thirdly, If they did indeed doubt of it <hi>before</hi> the Birth, they ought (as was said) to have <hi>sent</hi> some trusty Persons, or have signified their desire, that some <hi>here,</hi> whom they could confide in, should be <hi>present.</hi> If they only doubted of it after the Prince was Born, they might have demanded that the same Persons might have <hi>Counter-interrogated,</hi> and <hi>Examin'd</hi> the Witnesses; now they were bound in Conscience to use all such honest and wary Means before they proceded thus to the <hi>highest Extremities.</hi> Fourthly, If <hi>greatest Proof</hi> against <hi>no Proof</hi> could not satisfie them, Why did they not, to clear their Honour that they had not acted Unjustly, Undutifully, or Unchristianly since the time they came hither, bring the Matter into a <hi>new</hi> Examination? Since nothing

could <hi>more</hi> contribute to <hi>settle</hi> them in the Throne, had it been prov'd an Imposture, nor have more <hi>ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, If it had been done for the good of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to bring the <hi>French King</hi> lower, (though this could not justifie this Invasion,) yet Why was not at least the wisest Course taken for this? Had the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> pursued only the Ends express'd in his Declaration, and obliged King <hi>Iames,</hi> as he might easily have done, to <hi>redress Abuses here,</hi> and make a lasting League with the Confederates abroad; it had, in all likelihood, by this time reduced the <hi>French King</hi> to a low Condition: For then King <hi>Iames</hi> had been able to unite all the Force of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bend them unanimously against the Common Enemy: Whereas now our Men (and Money too) are employ'd in Fighting against one another in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; nor only so, but <hi>England</hi> it self, whose <hi>free Consent</hi> he so much brags of, is so Distracted, that we know not how soon we may fall into the same Misfortunes; <hi>some</hi> out of Conscience, not daring to hazard their <hi>Souls</hi> in Swearing Allegiance to one, whose Title the most zealous Adherers to him cannot agree on, nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are <hi>satisfied</hi> with; and far more of them being <hi>disgusted</hi> to see our Countrey <hi>beggared</hi> to maintain the Quarrel of <hi>Foreigners,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> our <hi>greatest Enemies the Dutch</hi>; so that this Pretence of pulling down the Heighth of <hi>France,</hi> though I doubt not, but it was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Confederates, was far from being the main Design of the <hi>Prince of Orange.</hi> He could then have no other Motive of Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>England,</hi> Driving out his <hi>Father,</hi> and Usurping his <hi>Throne,</hi> but mere <hi>Ambition,</hi> seconded by Dutch Policy, making use of our <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liousness,</hi> silly <hi>Credulity,</hi> and our addictedness to <hi>Lying,</hi> that they might <hi>cheat</hi> us of our <hi>Money,</hi> make us defend <hi>their</hi> Quarrel, and <hi>impoverish</hi> us to that degree, that we should not <hi>dare</hi> to resent it, when they get our <hi>Trade,</hi> and <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I must not forget the Instances he brings to prove this Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Doctrine, and vouch'd by the Law of <hi>Nations</hi>; and those are these Three.</p>

However, it is sufficient here to observe, that this is nothing at all to his purpose; he tells us but four lines before, That what <hi>he is to make out, is that the then</hi> P. <hi>of</hi> O <hi>by his Relation to the Crown, had a just Right to concern himself in the Vindication of our Religion and Liberties, and that this is not repugnant to the Doctrines of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>p.</hi> 15.

And if not, how does this Instance prove that which he is to <hi>make out,</hi> that the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his <hi>Relation</hi> to the Crown, had a just Right to concern himself; and his Instance proves that any Prince, whether they have any <hi>such Relation</hi> or not, have a just Right to concern themselves. And what, I pray, is all this to a Title by Conquest? Let it be admitted, but not granted, and which I suppose will not be easily proved, that no Foreign Prince hath a just Right to make War upon another Prince, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Liberty, and Religion of his own Subjects; hath he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a just Right to make a Conquest of these People, whose Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he pretends to defend, and to set himself King over them? Or had Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon pretence of securing the <hi>Dutch</hi> Liberties, a just Right to make her self Queen over them? In my Opinion it is a pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty odd way of rescuing People's Liberties, to make a Conquest of them; and if this be the Case, Princes and their Flatterers may talk of Piety and a Care of the People, but all the World will see that the Design is not <hi>Religion</hi> nor <hi>Liberty</hi> to the People, but a <hi>Crown</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and it cannot chuse but be very <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> to gain a Crown.</p>
            <p>His next Instance is in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time, When the <hi>Prince Elector was chosen King of</hi> Bohemia. And how does this prove his Point? Why, <hi>he sent to King</hi> James <hi>for Advice, and he had no mind he should engage in it.</hi> And therefore the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> hath a just Right to concern himself, and to make himself King according to the Principles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I perceive it is not for every body to make Consequences, for who but our Authour could ever have found out how such wonderful Things followed from King <hi>Iames</hi>'s denying his Son to engage in it. Well, <hi>But the Arch bishop wrote a Letter to the Secretary, and said, that he was satisfied in his Conscience that the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bemians had a just Cause, and that the King's Daughter professed she would not leave her self one Iewel, rather than not maintain so Religious and Righteous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Cause.</hi> And that may be too; but without Reflection on that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, that is no Evidence of the Righteousness of a Cause; for some Kings Daughters will not leave themselves a Jewel, rather than not to take away, and keep a Kingdom from their Own Father, and which is neither a Religious, nor a Righteous Cause.</p>
            <p>His Third Instance is in the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, <hi>When the King of</hi> Denmark <hi>had taken Arms to settle the Peace, and Liberty of the Germans, and was Defeated; and King</hi> Charles <hi>thought himself concerned to assist him; and Arch-bishop</hi> Laud <hi>drew up a Declaration setting forth the Danger, and requiring the People's Prayers and Assistance to prevent the growth of</hi> Spain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it does not appear whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s pretence of taking Arms was just, or unjust, (for our Authour has a peculiar faculty of talking of Things at random, and never stating them, and bringing them down to the matter in Dispute.) But let that be as it will, it makes no difference in the present Dispute; for let the Cause of his taking Arms be originally what it will, I hope King <hi>Charles</hi> might assist him to prevent his being over-run, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by securing the Peace and Safety of his own Kingdom. And this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109147:16"/>
was plainly the Case: The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had made War upon the Empire, and was defeated; and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is there no difference between Assisting one Prince actually at War with another, to prevent his utter Overthrow and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and in such a case for wise and politick Ends to stop the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant and dangerous Growth of a potent Neighbour; and for the same Prince to take away another Prince's Crown, because he is unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and ungratefull to his Subjects? Yet after such fallacious Inferences, our Author with his wonted Modesty adds, <hi>Let those who now with as much Ignorance as Confidence upbraid Men with Renouncing the Doctrines and Principles of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>read and consider these Passages, and if any thing will make them more wise and humble, this will.</hi>

            <p>He contends all along to prove from those Instances, which are of several <hi>Independent Governours,</hi> and so relate to the <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> that this Proceeding of the Prince of <hi>Orange is not repugnant to the Doctrines and Principles of the Church of</hi> England, p. 15. and more particularly afterwards from the <hi>Homilies,</hi> p. 21, 22. which say, <hi>we are bound to obey a Heathen Tyrant,</hi> and to <hi>pray</hi> for him; from the Jews who were <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to pray for the King of</hi> Babylon, and for <hi>obeying</hi> Augustus; last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from <hi>our Saviour's acknowledging the Roman President's Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as given him from God.</hi> Nay, he argues <hi>a fortiori,</hi> p. 21. from the <hi>Homilies,</hi> thus: <hi>If they</hi> (and consequently the Church of <hi>England</hi>) <hi>declare we are bound by God's Word to obey a Heathen Tyrant,</hi> much more ought we, <hi>by the Doctrines and Principles of our Church, to pay Allegiance to good and religious Princes,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>He denies p. 24. that King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Usage, after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arrival, was very hard, severe, and unjust. Let the World judge.

him at <hi>Ham-house,</hi> whither the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ordered him to go the next Morning; enough to let the King see what he was to expect. He tells the Prince of <hi>Orange could have prevented his going away</hi>; true: But then he feared the Nation would only <hi>reduce King Iames,</hi> not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him,</hi> much less <hi>chuse another,</hi> their own King being <hi>present</hi>; it was therefore thought more Politick to <hi>fright</hi> him <hi>away,</hi> and then pretend <hi>Abdication,</hi> and the Necessity of a <hi>new</hi> Government, which he knew well (as he and his <hi>Faction</hi> would handle it) could light on none but <hi>himself</hi>: So that it was out of kindness to <hi>himself,</hi> not to King <hi>Iames,</hi> or the <hi>Nation,</hi> that he let him escape. Yet he Magnifies this Indulgence of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> exceedingly; but I would ask him, in what this Civility differs from that of <hi>Robbers,</hi> who first strip the poor Travellers of all they have, and then turn them a Grazing without a Penny in their Purse, or as this pretty Gentleman phrases it, (<hi>p.</hi> 24.) <hi>Allow them great Freedom to go where they please.</hi> I would ask him too what <hi>one</hi> Thing was done by the Prince, which look'd either <hi>Generous, Civil,</hi> or in the <hi>least degree Respectful</hi> towards a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Father,</hi> and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Rude</hi>?

Had the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or our selves used the King Dutifully, as we ought, we might have secur'd our selves whilst that Prince was here against either <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Slavery</hi> (which we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to dread) being <hi>forc'd</hi> upon us, we might have enjoy'd <hi>Peace, Plenty, Trade,</hi> and <hi>Riches,</hi> and have reapt <hi>incomparable Benefits,</hi> and <hi>vast Advantages</hi> by the Distractions of <hi>all others</hi> round about us.

            </p>
            <p>But we can't forget what an <hi>Odium</hi> the <hi>Murther</hi> of <hi>King Charles</hi> I. brought upon the whole <hi>Island</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi>; yet there was then some just Apology to be made for that Barbarity: That <hi>Tremendous</hi> Fact was not committed 'till after Six Yeas Civil War, 'wherein the Victorious Rebels had conquer'd, disarm'd, and utterly impoverish'd the Loyal Party, yet there still remain'd a numerous Part of the Three Kingdome, who made many generous Attempts to restore King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the whole Nation wearied with their endless Miseries, and the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Usurpers, at last happily effected it.</p>
            <p>Now what shall we say for our selves, who have <hi>Abdicated</hi> our King without shedding <hi>One Ounce of Blood,</hi> or adventuring a bloody Nose in his <hi>Defence</hi>?

            <p>Yea, we are still so much worse than those of the last Age, in that now so numerous a Party of the very Clergy, who <hi>should,</hi> and <hi>do know</hi> the Oligation of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, which every single Man of them took to their <hi>lawful King,</hi> have by <hi>unpardonable Perjury</hi> renounc'd their King, and sworn Allegiance to One whom they know in their Consciences, and have often declar'd upon Occasion hath no <hi>legal Right</hi>; no, not so much as <hi>Cromewell the Wicked:</hi> These are the Men who have brought an <hi>indelible Scandal</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> upon our Religion. <hi>Miratur Orbis se tam cito factum esse Arrianum,</hi> was the pathetical Exclamation of a holy Authour of Old: What would he have said, if he had liv'd in our Age, to see a National Clergy <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> from the Establish'd Doctrine of their own Church, in the point of Allegiance and Non-resistance?

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:109147:19"/>
and to believe that they themselves <hi>own'd</hi> no God. Whether they do or not, I shall not give my self the trouble to enquire; but I am sure some of them do as good as own no <hi>Hell,</hi> by <hi>Teaching</hi> Men, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those <hi>terrible Threatnings</hi> God in his holy Word has denounc'd against the Incorrigible and Impenitent, of <hi>everlasting Fire, everlasting Punishment,</hi> &amp;c, he has not obliged himself to the literal Performance of them, since <hi>he that threatens keeps the Right of punishing in his own hand, and is not obliged to execute what he hath threatned, any farther than the Reasons and Ends of Government do require,</hi> &amp;c. Dr. <hi>Tillot son</hi>'s Sermon before the Queen, <hi>March</hi> 7. 1690. pag. 13.

            <p>Of what comfortable Importance this Doctrine may be to <hi>some,</hi> and how necessary under our present Circumstances, let any one judge: 'Tis impossible Men should have perpetrated such abominable Villanies as have been lately transacted, to the Amazement of all that have the least Sense of Piety or Honour left, unless their Minds had been first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched with these or the like Principles. He that will audaciously violate the sacred Commands of God, acknowledged such by the Church of <hi>England, his own Subscriptions, Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> must necessarily fansie some secret Reserves of Mercy in the Breast of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for the Authors and Abetters of such horrid Crimes, upon <hi>some Occasions,</hi> which will not suffer his Justice to pass upon them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, or some extraordinary <hi>Relaxations</hi> or <hi>Mitigations</hi> of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Torments. The first seems to be despaired of, because there is small Hopes of Repentance left, the Scriptures for that very Reason, perhaps, amongst many others, comparing <hi>Rebellion</hi> to the Sin of Witchcraft; the latter therefore is pitch'd upon as most congruous to carnal-minded Men, who to enjoy the <hi>Pleasures of Sin</hi> for a Season, and not willing to go to Heaven through Tribulations and Afflictions, do rather <hi>chuse</hi> to undergo a future Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Of what grand Concern these particulars are let every good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an seriously consider, and lay to heart.

            <p>The Doctrines and Duties of our holy Religion have the Spirit of Truth and Holiness for their Author, and like him are always the same, without any <hi>shadow of Change</hi>: But from what Spirit must these bold Attempts upon Common Christianity proceed? <hi>Holloixius</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Origen, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. cites several Passages out of his Writings, wherein he assigns a different evil Spirit to every Vice or Sin, which he calls <hi>inimicas, &amp; adversarias Virtutes,</hi> and delivers this Notion among the rest: <hi>There seems to me,</hi> says he, <hi>to be an infinite number of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Powers, or Spirits; because in almost every Man there are certain Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which incite and provoke him to the Commission of divers Sins:</hi> E.g. <hi>There is a Spirit of Fornication, and a Spirit of Anger, a Spirit of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and a Spirit of Pride; and if it happens that any Man be acted by all these, or more Sins, he is to be look'd upon as possessed by so many or more Enemies, or evil Spirits.</hi> Surely then, according to this Opinion of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi> Legion must have taken Possession in some of the Grandees of this new schisinatical Church of <hi>England.</hi> How obvious is it for any but those who are infatuated, and spiritually blind, to discern the Spirit

of <hi>Rebellion, Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Emulation</hi>; the Spirit of <hi>Heresie, Schism,</hi> and <hi>Persecution</hi>; the Spirit of <hi>Blasphemy, Lying, Slandering,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy,</hi> reigning and triumphing among them.</p>
            <p>This word <hi>Apostacy</hi> I am very sensible will found very harsh in their Ears; but let any sober and unprejudiced Person seriously consult the several Acceptations of the Word among sacred and prophane Authors, and he will soon be convinced, that it will be no easie Task for these Gentlemen to purge themselves from the imputation of it. <hi>Grotius,</hi> in his Appendix to his Commentaries <hi>de Antichristo,</hi> tell us, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the Abrenunciation, and the solemn Stipulation to keep God's holy Will and Commandments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before <hi>Baptism</hi> were the real Tests of the Faith and Sincerity of the Candidate, by which he was obliged to <hi>deny himself,</hi> and to <hi>take up his Cross; i.e.</hi> to forsake <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, Wife and Children, Lands and Possessions, and to lay down even his very Life,</hi> when ever they should come in competition with his Duty; and <hi>we</hi> cannot ordinarily be called to the Performance of this our <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Covenant,</hi> but under unrighteous and persecuting Princes, then it follows clearly, that by our entring into Christianity we have tied up our hands (by our own solemn Act) from making any forcible Resistence against our supreme Governours, upon any pretence whatsoever, and that the <hi>Doctrine of the Cross,</hi> or <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> is a fundamental Doctrine, or Principle of the Christian Religion; and, lastly, that whosoever <hi>teach</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> otherwise, are <hi>Renegadoes</hi> and <hi>Apostates</hi> from Christianity it self. This was very near the Assertion of Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> himself, in his Sermon on <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. v. 5. p. 36.
<q>But, blessed be God, our Church hates and condemns this Doctrine, (<hi>viz.</hi> of deposing and resisting of Kings,) from what hand soever it come, and hath established the Rights and Authority of Princes on sure and unalterable Foundations, enjoining an entire Obedience to all the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Commands of Authority, and an absolute Submission to that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power which God hath put in our Sovereigns Hands. This Doctrine we justly glory in, and if any that had their Education in our Church, have turned <hi>Renegadoes</hi> from this, they proved no less Enemies to the Church her self, than to the Civil Authority; so that their Apostacy leaves no blame on our Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If this be the Case (as we have all the Reason in the World to think so) it's plain and evident to any ordinary Understanding, That these
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109147:21"/>
Men are not true Church of <hi>England</hi> Divines, as they would have all the World believe; neither is the Church in Possession any more to be esteemed the True, Legal, Ancient Church of <hi>England,</hi> than the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists</hi> of Old were to be accounted the only <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Their Priesthood is now become <hi>Schismatical,</hi> having erected <hi>Altar</hi> against <hi>Altar</hi>; their Liturgy <hi>Blasphemous</hi> and <hi>Diabolical,</hi> wherein they address themselves to God as the Author and Fountain of all unjust Power, the Patron of Injustice, and the grand Protector, and Encourager of the Notorious Violators of his most sacred Laws. What is this, but with the most impudent and horrid Blasphemy that ever was heard of, to beseech the Almighty to divest himself of his most glorious Attributes, and to enter into a League with Hell it self, for the support and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of all their detestable Impieties.</p>
            <p>What have they now to say? Confusion and Shame must cover them, who are the <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Reproach</hi> of the Pure and Undefiled Religion they should profess. Thousands of these could not say (though in reality the well known pretence of most) that they swore for Bread; God forgive them they durst not trust Providence, wanted the Courage to give a good Example, or to teach their Flocks the danger of Perjury: They sinned against <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Anointed,</hi> and their own Souls, and <hi>knew they did</hi> so.</p>
            <p>In the preceeding Age we can scarce name a Dignifi'd Clergy-man, or any Person Eminent for Piety and Learning, in either of the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in City or Country, who were not outed their Benefices for refusing to take the Covenant or Engagement; but now the great Body of the Clergy have been observed to renounce their Allegiance, and worship the <hi>Idol</hi> of the <hi>Hogans</hi>: Indeed out of this Number we must except the <hi>Most Reverend</hi> the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and Seven of his <hi>Right Reverend</hi> Brethren, and the other Clergy and Loyal Fellows in the Universities, who have not defiled themselves with the Abominations of their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state</hi> Brethren, whose Virtue and Piety is the only Thing left to attone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for these loud and crying Sins of our Clergy; and, who incessantly like <hi>Abraham</hi> intercede with Almighty God to avert his Judgments from this sinful Nation, and which the <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Apostacy,</hi> and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Defection gives but too sad an occasion to fear hangs over our Heads.</p>
            <p>In short, whatever hopes we may conceive of ever seeing the true Church of <hi>England</hi> flourish in its true Lustre and Purity, we must owe it (next to the infinite Mercy of God) to those never enough applauded <hi>Heroes</hi> of our Church, the true Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and those ejected Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have stood in the <hi>Gap</hi> of Schism, and <hi>bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

How will these glorious Lights of our Church, and true Servants of the living God shine after their Tryal is over past, when the Adorer's of Mammon (those <hi>interloping</hi> Arch bishops, Bishops, and those other mean spiritted Worldlings, who preferred their <hi>Profit</hi> before their <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi>) shrink, look <hi>dim</hi> and <hi>pale</hi> with Guilt; and at length their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks

            <p>Some Instances he brings (<hi>p.</hi> 26.) to shew we are not <hi>singular</hi> in Perjury and Rebellion. He tells us that the Law of the <hi>Land</hi> and of <hi>Nations,</hi> require us to swear Allegiance to him who is in Possession: Which lame Pretence is answered fully over and over, in the forenamed Books against Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>; only this Gentleman's Assertion is more raw than his, for <hi>he</hi> proceeds upon <hi>quiet Possession</hi> (as do also our Lawyers, whom he speaks of, and would have quoted if he durst.) But this Man makes account that <hi>bare Possession,</hi> however qualified, gives Title to our Allegiance, nay <hi>obliges</hi> us to <hi>swear</hi> it too, which we cannot do unless we can safely swear, that this Discourse of his is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive; which, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To assert that mere <hi>Possession</hi> of a Thing gives a Man Right to it, is enough to encourage all Men to be <hi>Rebels, Vsurpers, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Cheats.</hi> It cries aloud to them all, <hi>Catch that catch may, my Masters; all that you get is your own, by the Law of the Land, and of Nations, of once you get but Possession.</hi> It makes the saying of the Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eves [<hi>This is mine, I stole it</hi>] very strong Reason and good Sense. He'll say these Cases are not parallel to his: But why are they not, if a true Prince has as <hi>good Right</hi> to his Crown, as a Subject has to his <hi>Money</hi> or his <hi>Goods</hi>? For if he has, then a Possession <hi>transfers</hi> the Right of a <hi>Crown</hi>; so it must transfer the Right of a <hi>Purse,</hi> a <hi>Cloak,</hi> &amp;c. And with so much the more Reason as the Right of the Crown (on which the common Good of the Nation depends.) ought to be more <hi>fixt</hi> and <hi>unalienable,</hi> than the Right of private Men to their Goods, which are of an <hi>inferior</hi> Concern. Now if the Law of the Land require us to swear Allegiance as due to any present Possessor, the same Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that Allegiance, and consequently the Crown is his <hi>Right</hi>; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Law would oblige me to swear false. And if the <hi>Law of the Land</hi> declares the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has <hi>Right</hi>; To what end did this Gentleman all this while run about to the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> to patch him up a Title? It must be a pitiful Cause that makes a Man, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise has wit enough, still interfere thus with himself.</p>
            <p>But he says, That if <hi>an Oath of Allegiance should not follow Possession, there would be infinite Snares to the Consciences of all such who are requir'd to obey, but are not bound to enquire into the Right of War.</hi> Note, by the way, one of those shuffling Tricks, of which his Book is full. He begins with <hi>Oaths,</hi> but proceeds as if only <hi>Obedience</hi> were required: As if a Man could not live quietly under a Government, without <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and calling God to witness that the Governor has <hi>Right</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (and consequently to our Allegiance,) whether we know he has or no. But let us apply our selves to his Discourse. All the play of these Men, is to persuade the World that this business of Allegiance due to <hi>King Iames</hi> only, is a Kind of <hi>dubious Case</hi>; and then if they can but get their Judgment to <hi>bover,</hi> they hope that Interest or Fear <hi>may turn the Ballance,</hi> and make them swear to <hi>King William:</hi> Whereas we maintain that 'tis a <hi>most plain</hi> Case, which none but <hi>byass'd</hi> Men can <hi>doubt</hi> of. Is it not evident to all, that King <hi>Iames</hi> was Three Years
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109147:22"/>
agoe the undoubted Supreme Governor, and that all the World held that none but he had <hi>Right</hi> to the Crown, and consequently that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance would then be <hi>lawfully</hi> sworn to <hi>none but him</hi>? Is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he is <hi>living,</hi> and has not <hi>given up</hi> his Right; and so, by the common course of the World, 'tis evidently <hi>his still</hi>? Is it not evident even to themselves that the new Right of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, that Men are in several Minds about the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of it; some alledging <hi>one</hi> Thing, others <hi>another,</hi> which shews that <hi>England</hi> it self is <hi>not satisfied</hi> with the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Title, but is led on by <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Interest</hi>? Is it not evident that very many conscientious and good Men, amongst whom are the Primate, and some Bishops, and many reverend and worthy Pastors of our Church do refuse to take the New Oath; whose Authority far <hi>outweighs all</hi> the others, in regard they have no Motive but <hi>pure Conscience,</hi> since they are <hi>ruin'd</hi> for <hi>refusing</hi>; whereas the <hi>Complying</hi> Party find <hi>Interest,</hi> and the <hi>Favour</hi> of great Men, by their mercenary Submission? Is it not manifestly evident to every sincere Christian's Conscience, even of the most ordinary Capacity, that Oaths are <hi>most Sacred</hi> Things; and that those Oaths which were due, or have been <hi>sworn</hi> upon <hi>certain</hi> Grounds to an <hi>undoubted</hi> and <hi>indisputable</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ought not to be <hi>unsworn</hi> again, by swearing Allegiance upon <hi>uncertain</hi> Grounds to a <hi>dubious</hi> (at least) and <hi>disputable</hi> Authority? So that here is no <hi>moot Case</hi> in the Business, as he would pretend, but <hi>plain Sense,</hi> which <hi>every</hi> sincere and conscientious Christian is capable of comprehending: There is no danger then of <hi>infinite Snares,</hi> (as he madly calls them,) not of <hi>any</hi> at all, but those of <hi>weak Fears,</hi> or <hi>base Interest,</hi> which have already <hi>ensnared</hi> many Consciences, and are spread every where, as the <hi>Devil's Nets</hi> to <hi>entangle</hi> and <hi>ensnare</hi> the unwary, unstable, and worldly minded Men.</p>
            <p>He asks, <hi>p.</hi> 26. If it be Perjury and Rebellion in the now <hi>French King's Conquests, for the Inhabitants to take Oaths of Fidelity to the French King</hi>? Now this is a very pleasant Gentleman; and for all his objecting, p. 19. <hi>The admiring the French Conduct to this sort of Mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> [Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s Friends.] He hath said more for the <hi>French King</hi> than any <hi>Iacobite</hi> in <hi>England</hi> will say, and the rankest <hi>French Man</hi> in the World can say no more; and that is, that he hath a Right to all the Places he has over-run with his Arms, in <hi>Flanders, Savoy,</hi> yea, and the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> too. But then, Where is that independant So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty which our Author talks of, as necessary and essential to make a Title by Conquest? For he is possess'd of the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi>; and therefore according to our Author, the King of <hi>France</hi> is Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and no body else. And not to meddle with what Right Conquest conveys, (as being foreign to the present Question;) here is this vast difference in the two Cases: The King of <hi>France</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Conquered these Places and People; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did not Conquer <hi>England,</hi> and none but a Mad-man will say he did: And therefore if the Author would have made the Case parallel, he should thus have put his Question, Whether it would not have been Perjury for the Inhabitants of those Places, to have put the Government into the <hi>French King's</hi> Hands, to transfer their Allegiance, and to take an Oath of Fidelity to him, when it was in their Power to resist; nay,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109147:22"/>
when he could not do it otherwise but by themselves, and by their own Contrivance, and Assistance: In that Case, which is plainly ours, I stick not to affirm that it is Perjury and Rebellion with a witness; and no Man who hath not his Ear bored, and is became a Slave to Interest, can have the Face to deny it: And yet for all that he goes on. <hi>If it be not Perjury and Rebellion in those Conquer'd Provinces, How comes it to be so here?</hi> By which we say again, he is ready to <hi>maintain,</hi> (for he does here manifestly <hi>suggest</hi> it <hi>already,</hi>) That <hi>England</hi> is the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s by <hi>Conquest,</hi> and all our Lives and Estates are at his Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. And there wants nothing but one of his <hi>infinite Snares,</hi> a good rich Deanry, or Bishoprick, to make him <hi>perfectly hold</hi> and <hi>openly maintain</hi> that Opinion. <hi>Parliaments</hi> had best look to such Libels in time, left the pretended Conqueror come to <hi>abdicate them</hi> too as <hi>Vseless,</hi> or <hi>Obstacles</hi> to the pretence of <hi>Conquest,</hi> and make all our Countrey-men become Slaves to his Ambition.</p>
            <p>But what meant he by his instancing, <hi>p.</hi> 26, 27. in the <hi>Portugueze's</hi> swearing Allegiance to the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had enjoyed the <hi>Crown</hi> for Three Generations? The Case was this. There were Three Pretenders to that Crown, and most of the Universities in <hi>Europe</hi> were emploied to determine which of them had <hi>Right</hi>; when <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, while the Thing was yet under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, seeing them encline most to the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> sends the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> with an Army, and very <hi>unfairly</hi> Surprizes and Oppresses the Headless Nation, and decided the Controversie by the Sword: This was no <hi>Conquest,</hi> but a manifest <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> for no Battle was fought, nor Resistance made; Was this parallel to the Case of us in <hi>England</hi>? Was our Nation <hi>Headless</hi> at the time of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Was it <hi>under dispute</hi> whether King <hi>Iames,</hi> or <hi>he</hi> had <hi>Right</hi> to the Crown? Or had King <hi>Iames usurp'd</hi> it, as King <hi>Philip</hi> had done? Was he not in <hi>quiet</hi> Possession of <hi>England,</hi> which King <hi>Philip</hi> never was? The <hi>Portugueze</hi> still grumbling and resenting, that they were enslav'd to a Foreigner, when a King of their own Nation had a Title to it. Again, their swearing Allegiance to King <hi>Philip,</hi> was too, in many regards, more justifiable than <hi>ours</hi>; they were kept under by a Foreign <hi>Force,</hi> whereas we do it <hi>voluntarily</hi>: Besides, the Spanish King had been one of the <hi>Pretenders,</hi> and the <hi>Question was not decided.</hi> Had the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or his Princess, any kind of <hi>pretence</hi> to <hi>England</hi> while their Father liv'd? Lastly, They rose against a <hi>Foreign</hi> King to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce one of their <hi>own</hi> Nation, whereas we rose against our <hi>own</hi> to introduce a <hi>Foreigner.</hi> How shallow then is it to huddle together many Instances, and not bring one of them home to his purpose? How ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to argue all along from Matters of <hi>Fact</hi> to Matter of <hi>Right</hi>? Which is just as wise as to pretend, that whatever <hi>has</hi> been <hi>done,</hi> must be <hi>well done</hi>; and is the same, as if he would set himself to prove, that we were not the <hi>first,</hi> nor the <hi>only</hi> Rebels, Traytors, or Perjured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that have been in the <hi>World</hi>; but that there have been <hi>others,</hi> both of our <hi>own</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Nations before us, which we never denied.</p>
            <p>He has not done with his Plot, to prove the Paper none of Mr. <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s; but (take which you will) tells you <hi>p.</hi> 28. That either 'tis not his, or else that <hi>he contradicted himself.</hi> In what I beseech him? Why.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109147:23"/>
Mr. <hi>Ashton,</hi> at his Tryal said <hi>He could not but own he had a fair Tryall for his Life,</hi> and yet in his Paper he complains of the <hi>severe Charge of the Iudges,</hi> and <hi>hard Measure</hi>: And where lies the Contradiction? Every Man knows that the <hi>Tryall</hi> is over before the <hi>Charge</hi> is given, or the <hi>Verdict</hi> brought in by the Jury: So that nothing hinders but the <hi>Tryall</hi> may be fair, and seemingly kind, though the <hi>Charge</hi> which came after did aggravate, and made the worse Misconstruction (as indeed it did) of every thing, and so was very <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>severe.</hi> But does Mr. <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> mention no <hi>hard Measures</hi> besides? Does he not object his <hi>close Imprisonment,</hi> the <hi>hasty and violent Proceedings against him, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry used in the Return of fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Were not these <hi>hard Measures,</hi> and some of them villanously unjust, and indeed plainly shewed, that since they saw him so heartily honest, that he would not be warpt, the Resolution was taken beforehand by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have his Life, <hi>per Fas aut Nefas</hi>? Does he deny these were <hi>hard Measures,</hi> or that Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> said true, when he told us he had receiv'd such <hi>hard Measures</hi>? He confesses <hi>both,</hi> by his Silence in such main Businesses. Is it not a rare piece of Justice, to cull out a select Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Court Pick-thanks, who they were sure would hang him; and yet deny a Copy of the Panel, that he might except against some chief <hi>Boute-feus,</hi> (and particularly that malicious Jury Man he so complains of,) who would never leave pressing and solliciting the rest, till they brought them (let the Cause be never so ugly) into the same Guilt of <hi>Murther</hi> with themselves? Yet a Man who loses his Life by such Tricks, is (according to this Caviller) <hi>confident, uncharitable,</hi> or whatever other Character his time-serving Spite thinks fit to put upon him, if he do but barely speak of what they <hi>did</hi> to take away his Life.</p>
            <p>Now after all this Outcry and heavy Charges, to lay Load upon the Martyr's Credit, what was it he said: <hi>Though I have,</hi> I <hi>think, just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complain of the severe Charge given by the Iudges, and the hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet as I hope for Pardon at the Hands of my God, I do most heartily pray for and forgive them,</hi> &amp;c. Could any thing be said <hi>more sweetly,</hi> or <hi>more modestly</hi>? He onely spoke it <hi>in Transcursu,</hi> and as a Transition to the declaring his Charitable Forgiving of his Enemies: He onely said [<hi>he thought</hi>] he had received ill Usage, and why might not he <hi>think</hi> so, when his Lawyers told him the Law did not reach him, there being onely <hi>Presumption,</hi> which was <hi>incompetent</hi> in that Case? Yet this uncharitable Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iller charges him with <hi>Confidence,</hi> and want of <hi>Common Charity,</hi> and employs all his little Tricks of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick to have it thought he dyed an ill Man, and (which is the worse Sin of the two) to <hi>murther</hi> as far as he could, his <hi>Soul,</hi> and his Credit as a good Christian, after the Judges and Jury had <hi>murthered</hi> his <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how does he clear the Jury? He cites my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> p. 29. that the <hi>Intent is to be discovered by Circumstances,</hi> &amp;c. But does he or any Man say, that those Circumstances must not be <hi>evidently connected</hi> with the <hi>Intention</hi>; that is, such as <hi>could not</hi> have light or could <hi>not</hi> have been put, had there not been such an <hi>Intention</hi>? Otherwise the Evidence rises not above <hi>Presumption,</hi> which that Lawyer declares to be insufficient; and therefore he requires <hi>Good and Manifest Proof</hi>; and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109147:23"/>
the Proof of a Man's <hi>Intention</hi> cannot be said to be <hi>manifest,</hi> unless the Over-act was manifestly connected with it. Was it so here? <hi>Ashton</hi> clear'd the occasion of his going over to <hi>France</hi> to have been upon a quite different Account. But the Papers, says he, were <hi>found about him.</hi> What then? Might not another who was in the Company, and who onely was conscious of their Contents, give them to him to keep? Nay, would not that Person who was concerned judge it <hi>best</hi> in Reason, rather to give them to a Person which was <hi>not at all</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, than to another of his own Gang? Certainly he would. Nothing more frequent in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days, than for loyal Gentlemen go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Coach, to give such Papers which were Treasonable in those days to the Coachman, or some Gentlewomen in Company; and must such Persons who carried them be concluded guilty of Treason? This Circumstance then of having the Papers found upon him, which were evidently <hi>another</hi> Man's Concern, as being writ in <hi>his</hi> hand, was so far from being <hi>manifestly connected</hi> with <hi>his</hi> being concerned in them, or <hi>knowing their Contents</hi>; that, of the two it rather signifies the <hi>contrary.</hi> Besides, this Circumstance is not rightly represented. Had they been found upon him when <hi>first search'd,</hi> it might have born a sleight Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he was the Bearer of them; but when he was first forc'd out of the hiding Place, he was search'd, and nothing found about him; but going down afterwards to the Hold of the Ship, and finding those Papers left, (which he might suspect my Lord <hi>Preston</hi> would not have had found,) he put them in his Bosome, with design to throw them over-board, which being observed, they were found there. Well; but he had a mind to have these Papers thrown over-board: What then? Would not any Friend do the same, if his Friend and Fellow-Traveller, who by leaving his Letters behind him where he lay, had by so doing signified, that he would not have them seen, though at the same time he <hi>knew</hi> nothing of the <hi>Contents.</hi> Did not Captain <hi>Billop</hi> at the Tryal declare upon Oath, that Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> was much more concerned than he was, and yet no Presumptive Evidence was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereupon against him, of knowing their Contents? Again, Are there no <hi>Secrets,</hi> and <hi>important</hi> Ones too, but <hi>Treason</hi>? What Man who is versed in the World would have made such a <hi>rash Conclusion</hi> of his knowing the Contents of the Letters from a Carriage, as was lately shew'd <hi>has sometimes,</hi> and <hi>may often</hi> be used in other Occasions, where he that <hi>destroys</hi> or <hi>conceals</hi> any Papers of another's, is yet utterly ignorant of what's in them, or what is his Friend's Design? My self in the Protector's Days lodged near the <hi>Pall-Mall,</hi> when a Civil Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came to take a Room in the same Hou'e; it seems he came over to <hi>England</hi> about King <hi>Charles</hi> his Business, though he kept it to himself, and never in the least had acquainted me with it; upon a fright he came running from the Yard into the House, and feating a Search, retired into a safe hiding Place, giving me some Papers (which it seems he would not have found <hi>with him</hi>) to secure them if I could, or else to <hi>burn</hi> them. I did not much fear, knowing the Constable; so I lock'd them in a small Trunk of Mine, and put them under the Beds-head. They search'd but found nothing. Here is a Case paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel exactly, or rather far more obnoxious than was that of Mr. <hi>Ashton's,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:109147:24"/>
and more significant, that I was privy to the Design of them. Now I would ask this inconsiderate Jury, whether, had those Papers (which I understood afterwards to be <hi>Commissions</hi>) been found in <hi>my</hi> Trunk, they would have brought me in <hi>guilty</hi>? Doubtless such a Jury as <hi>this</hi> would have done it; and yet I can safely be deposed, That I was then utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant, both of the <hi>Business</hi> of that Gentleman, and of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> of the Papers. I desire those <hi>Gentlemen of the Iury</hi> to lay their Hands on their Hearts, and tell us seriously, whether they durst have ventured their own Lives, (could it have been brought to the Tryall,) that Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi> intended to go into <hi>France</hi> with such a <hi>Design</hi>? I doubt their Hearts would quail at such a <hi>dubious</hi> Wager: And could they think fit to take away another Man's Life, and hazard to damn their own Souls too, on an Evidence that they durst not stake their own Lives upon. Let them reflect how often even <hi>very great Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods</hi> deceive us every day; nay, sometimes so great, that we should have judged it almost <hi>impossible</hi> it should have <hi>missed</hi>; and yet no wise or good Man would venture his <hi>Life</hi> or his <hi>Salvation</hi> upon those <hi>highest Likelihoods,</hi> or think fit to <hi>swear</hi> the Truth of them; and dare <hi>Iuror<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> then hazard to <hi>forswear</hi> themselves, and to commit Murther in to the Bargain, by bringing in an illegal Verdict, which takes away a Man's Life upon <hi>Likelihoods</hi> or <hi>Presumptions</hi>? The Law he confesses requires <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Proof</hi>; What says this Patron of Injustice to the Law? Yet <hi>this Proof</hi> (says he, page 29.) <hi>must still be such as the thing will bear.</hi> Let us examine the sense of these Words. Either he means by the Word [<hi>Thing,</hi>] a Fact of such a Nature as Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s is pretended to be, and that such a Fact, <hi>abstractedly speaking,</hi> cannot bear a <hi>more manifest</hi> Proof than this had: Or he means that this individual pretended Fact, as standing under the Circumstances it <hi>really had,</hi> can bear no better Proof than it did, or be made <hi>more manifest.</hi> He cannot without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Folly mean the <hi>former</hi> of these: For it is evident and confessed here, p. 30. by himself, That had the Papers been produced <hi>writ in his own hand, it would have been a plain Proof of his knowing what was in those Papers,</hi> (which by the way, is a plain Confession, that (that Proof wanting) there was no <hi>plain</hi> or <hi>manifest</hi> Proof at all,) He must mean then, <hi>that this Fact, no better circumstanc'd, can bear no better Proof</hi>: Which is in less candid Terms to say; <hi>We were resolved to hang him, and could have been glad of a plain or manifest Proof, but the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we could get from all the Circumstances, not bearing or affording as such a Proof, we were forced to condemn him upon this unmanifest Proof, or else</hi> (which would have vexed us) <hi>we must have acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted him.</hi> This is what he would say, had he the Gift of Ingenuity. Well then, since there was (as he confesses) no <hi>plain</hi> or <hi>manifest</hi> Proof, what Proof will he afford us instead of it? Why, he tells us, <hi>there was sufficient Proof of his Privity to the Contents of those Papers.</hi> Sufficient! What does he mean by that indeterminate and insignificant Expression? No Proof is <hi>sufficient</hi> by the Law but what is manifest: But he as good as confesses here, that the Proof was not <hi>manifest.</hi> He can onely mean then by that lukewarm word [<hi>sufficient,</hi>] that the Proof was <hi>sufficient</hi> to take away his Life, if such Judges and such a Jury had the managing of it, who were resolved to sacrifice their Consciences and Honesty to the Fear or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109147:24"/>
Favour of Men, and blindly submit them; without Scruple, to the Pleasure of the State.</p>
            <p>Next he tells us, <hi>there can be no direct and plain Proofs of a secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> How many Tricks are coucht in these few words? What does the word [<hi>direct</hi>] here? Did any Man ever pretend he could <hi>see</hi> a Soul <hi>directly,</hi> or receive Impressions from it in a <hi>streight Line,</hi> as Light and visible Objects come to the bodily <hi>Eye</hi>? Again: What does the word [<hi>secret</hi>] here? Had it not been enough to say, <hi>None can have a plain Proof of an Intention</hi>? But to confound the weak Reader, and colour over the Paradox, he must add [<hi>secret</hi>] to it. Indeed while an Intention is <hi>secret,</hi> 'tis undoubtedly <hi>secret</hi>; but why can there be no plain Proof of an Intention, making it become <hi>not secret</hi>? Certainly the denying this would destroy all humane Negotiation, in all its mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Concerns, and make all our chief Actions <hi>floating</hi> and <hi>uncertain:</hi> It makes all the Execution of the Law <hi>comfortless</hi> to the Judges and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and wickedly <hi>injurious</hi> to the Persons accused; for by this Man's Discourse the former can never tell whether or not they condemn an <hi>Innocent,</hi> and the latter sees his Life and Honor exposed to <hi>Hap-hazard.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Intention,</hi> and that <hi>onely,</hi> which the Law regards, nor is any Action reputed by it to be Felony, Murther, Treason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unless it be done <hi>Animo Felonico,</hi> &amp;c. with a Felonious <hi>Intention,</hi> &amp;c. and this Intention, according to him, can never be made <hi>plain</hi>; so no Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Did this Gentleman, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that <hi>Intentions</hi> can admit of <hi>plain Proof,</hi> never hear of those Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, That <hi>out of the abundance of the Heart the Mouth speaketh,</hi> or that <hi>the Tree is known by its Fruit; i.e.</hi> a Man's <hi>Interiour</hi> by his <hi>Outward Actions</hi>? Can we not know very manifestly, that if a Man way-lay his Enemy, and out of an Ambush assaults and runs him through, he had an Intention to do him a Mischief? Does not himself confess, that had the Papers been in Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s own hand, it had been a <hi>plain</hi> or <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Proof</hi> of his <hi>knowing their Contents</hi>; which <hi>Knowledge</hi> is of its own Nature altogether as <hi>secret</hi> as is an <hi>Intention:</hi> Lastly, Does he not tell us out of my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> that no Proof is sufficient but a manifest one; and yet he sets himself to prove, that there <hi>can be no plain</hi> or

manifest <hi>Proof of an Intention,</hi> which makes the Law require <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities</hi>? What Stuff is this to be vented by a Man chosen out to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the State, vindicate the Judges, and confute the solid Paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd us by our dying Martyr!</p>
            <p>After this he pretends, that, <hi>in his Iudgment,</hi> one of the Papers was writ in the <hi>very same Hand in which this Speech was written</hi>; that is, it was <hi>writ by Mr.</hi> Ashton.

They found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed another Paper of his, which more vext them and hastened his Death, than had they found any such other as this Gentleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends: Concerning which take the Martyr's own Words out of <hi>part of that Paper left by him in a Friend's hands</hi>; which are as followeth.</p>

               <p>[Being suddenly to give up my Accounts to the Searcher of all Hearts, I think it a Duty incumbent upon me to impart some Things farther, which neither the Interest nor Iniquity of these Times will, I conclude, willingly bear the publication of, and therefore not fit to be inserted in the Sheriffs Paper.</p>
               <p>Some time after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arrival here, when it was expected, that, pursuant to his own Declaration, and the King's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Convention, an exact Search and Enquiry would have been made into the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> there was a Scheme drawn up of that whole Matter, and of the Proofs that were then (and are still) ready to be produced, to prove his Royal Highness's Legitimacy; but no publick Examination being ever had, and the Violence of the Times, as well as Interest of the present Government, not permitting any private Person to move in it, those Papers have ever since lain by: But it being now thought advisable by some, to have them printed and published, and (as at first they were designed) addressed, at their next Meeting, to the Lords and Commons, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them to enquire into that weighty Affair, and to call forth, examine, and protect (for who else dares to appear) the many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to the several Particulars therein offered to be legally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was ordered to carry those Papers to the King, my Master, for his view, that his Leave and Approbation might go along with the Desires of his good Subjects here; and they being taken with me, with some other Papers of Accounts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a small Trunck, amongst my Linen, and other private Things of my own, and not in the Packet, (my Lord <hi>Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Love and Compassion that I have for my native Countrey, as well as Charity, obliges me humbly to implore Almighty God to be merciful to it, and not to charge this great Sin to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Account, and that we may not farther provoke his Justice by our wilfully continuing in Errour and Mistake, I beseech him to put it into the Hearts of the Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at their next Meeting, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine into that whole Matter, and (if before that time this be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished) to enquire after, call for, and, if possible, retrieve those Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that were taken with me; whereby the Obstinate will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be convinced, the Ignorant informed, the Doubtful confirmed, the Eyes of all opened, and a sacred most important Truth made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the whole World.]</p>

            <p>And may we not now with good Reason challenge those of the other Party to give an Answer to those Papers, which were the true occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Suffering; and in behalf of Justice, Truth, and the good of the Nation, to demand that the said Papers, which are now stiffled, may be produced, and (if possible) confuted: For since never grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fedulity was used by any other to set that Business in a manifest Light; the Answering them must consequently be the surest Means to keep the Nation from being imposed upon in so weighty a Matter. And if this be not done, Will not all sincere Persons conclude hence that the Proofs of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s Legitimacy, contained in those Papers of Mr. <hi>Ashton,</hi> are even in the Opinion of our Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know the Observator upon Mr. <hi>Ashton</hi>'s Papers denies there were any such; but could it be done with our Security, we do undertake to prove Circumstantially, that they were in his Trunck when taken by the Government's Order; and farther that we will clear that whole Matter, far more fully than has been done hitherto, by many other Witnesses of unquestionable Credit, and by most convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Proofs; and to satisfie all I terrogatories that can be offered by the most inquisitive Scrupler. But to return to our Juries; What mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it what was brought to light about those Papers <hi>afterwards</hi>? The
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109147:26"/>
Question is, what Evidence the Jury <hi>then</hi> had, <hi>when</hi> they brought in their lawless Verdict: If they had <hi>at that time</hi> no <hi>such</hi> Evidence as the Law requires; <hi>i.e.</hi> if they had <hi>then no manifest</hi> Proof, he died Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>in the Eye of the Law</hi>; and nothing can acquit his Condemners from being, according <hi>to the same Law,</hi> and God's Law too, <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Murderers.</hi> And 'tis of <hi>this</hi> kind of Innocence only the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr speaks, when he declares himself <hi>Innocent</hi>; about which P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ssage this Gentleman, who can neither understand <hi>another Man,</hi> nor many times <hi>himself</hi> very well, is very Gay and Pleasant: Though, 'tis true, the Martyr by owning his Duty to his lawful Sovereign, does withall, by consequence profess, that, though he had been legally Convicted of an <hi>intention</hi> to <hi>restore</hi> him, and of <hi>acting</hi> too, in order to that good End, he had notwithstanding been Innocent also <hi>before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Result of all the whole foregoing Discourse is this, That our blessed Martyr is clearly <hi>vindicated</hi> from any <hi>Treasonable Guilt,</hi> and proved to have died <hi>doubly Innocent</hi>; in the sight of <hi>Heaven,</hi> in dying for his <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which provok'd this unreasonable Malice against him; and <hi>in the Eye of the Law,</hi> by being adjudg'd to die without <hi>manifest Proof,</hi> or legal Evidence. May his Noble Christian Fortitude, and his Pious Example, so influence his <hi>Prevaricating Brethren,</hi> that they may repent them of their <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> imitate his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Loyalty,</hi> and be partakers of that Eternal Crown of Glory which he now enjoys, for undauntedly owning, and even to Death persevering in his Duty of Allegiance to his <hi>only Lawful,</hi> and <hi>only Rightful</hi> Sovereign.</p>
            <div type="petition">
               <head>An Humble Petition to the Present Government.</head>
               <p>SInce Nature does generally encline every Man to avoid his own Ruine, and to do that which is apparently best for his own world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interest and Conveniency; it cannot in common Reason and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be imagined, but that the generality of those, who do adhere to King <hi>IAMES</hi> his Title, would be glad to live at Ease, and out of Danger, by submitting freely to the present Government, did not some Consideration that is of a Superior Nature, and concerns their well-being in another World, over-awe them and deter them from owning it. Wherefore as we who write this, <hi>do</hi> in our Names, so we justly presume we <hi>may</hi> in the Names of those others, protest in the presence of Almighty God, who sees their Hearts, that our refusing to take the Oath, and pay a voluntary Allegiance to the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, does not spring from any inclination to Faction, nor from Obstinacy, nor yet from any Disaffection to their Persons; but purely from this, That we cannot be satisfied, either by our own Reason, or any Thing that has been hitherto writ upon that Subject, that they have <hi>any</hi> Title to the Crown, either by the Law of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi>; but, on the contrary, that both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane Laws</hi> are <hi>against</hi> their wresting it, by a <hi>Trick,</hi> out of the Hands of their Father, who was the <hi>undoubted rightful</hi> Owner of it; and that their still <hi>Possessing</hi> and <hi>Detaining</hi> it from him, is no less <hi>against</hi> the <hi>same Laws,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>a doubly-unjust Vsurpation</hi>: And therefore our Conscience tells
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109147:26"/>
us, That we shall incurr the just Indignation of Almighty God; and withal, become Obnoxious, by our English Laws, to the Punishments due to <hi>Traitors,</hi> should we yield to such illegal Compliances. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we humbly Petition, That for satisfaction to our Consciences, our Governours would please to give Order, that some grave and learned Man may compile a Treatise, shewing <hi>their true</hi> Title to the Crown, and manifesting how King <hi>Iames</hi>'s legal Title, by Succession, comes to be <hi>annull'd</hi>: And let him evince these Two main Points from any solid Principles, of what nature soever, acknowledg'd for such by the indifferent part of the World; and so that it may appear by their giving Authority to that Treatise, by such their Order, that <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>true Ground</hi> of their Claim, and the Title they will <hi>stand by.</hi> Those who have writ in Justification of their Government, are in so many Minds about the <hi>Ground</hi> of their pretended <hi>Right,</hi> that instead of <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it they have, by their Disagreement, satisfied all understanding Men, that 'tis <hi>very obscure,</hi> even to their <hi>own Party</hi>; whereas yet it ought to <hi>be of it self,</hi> or else <hi>be made</hi> most <hi>Evident,</hi> e'er it can in any Reason be held able to overthrow a Tenure so <hi>incontestibly Evident</hi> and <hi>Legal,</hi> as was that of King <hi>Iames,</hi> it being built on a long continued H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Succession, abetted by the most Fundamental Laws of the Land, and approved by the universal acknowledgement of the whole World. We humbly request then to be inform'd which of those many Grounds, advanc'd by their Writers, themselves will think fit to make choice of, and esteem <hi>thus Evident,</hi> which we have not hitherto any Light to guess at. Their Carriage by carressing and advancing Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> seems to hint that they most approve of his new Notion; but that Flash of his has been so perfectly and so manifoldly baffled, and laid flat beyond all possibility of setting it up again, or supporting it, that (next to the <hi>Abdication</hi> Title) no Tenet in the World was ever so notoriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Folly and Inconsistency. We are told that Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> is about publishing something upon that Subject, with a disclaim of any other Title but that he is setting up: But as we are well assured that the Principles that Gentleman will proceed upon, (however he may pretend to wrest our Laws to his Fancy,) are purely <hi>Commonwealthish,</hi> and no less confident that our Governours will never think it Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for them to own such a <hi>precarious</hi> Authority; so we cannot think it safe in Conscience for us to acquiesce in such a Title, which they themselves will not think fit to acknowledge and <hi>abide by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Request is for another Regard the more Reasonable, because the granting it is clearly the best for the Interest even of our Governours themselves: For nothing can be more Prevalent to unite all <hi>England</hi> in a hearty Subjection to their Government, than the making out Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and <hi>Inconfutably</hi> (in Case they judge it fecible) upon what Ground we may justly hold the former Prince's rightful Title is <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,</hi> and their own rightfully <hi>Introduced</hi> and <hi>Established.</hi> Nor can an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109147:27"/>
in the whole World, ought not to be held abolish'd by a Title which is <hi>controverted</hi> and <hi>dubious</hi>; and also that <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The granting then this Humble Petition of ours being every way so <hi>Reasonable</hi> and Advantagious to their own Honour and Interest; so satisfactory to those who have Scruples, which hinder their Complying; so agreeable to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration, which promises not to persecute for Conscience sake; so conducive to the Peace and Union of the Kingdom in general; and, lastly, so necessary to clear the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all their own Party, now lying under the Scandal of Complying they know not why, and of Sacrificing their <hi>Consciences</hi> to <hi>servile Fear</hi> or <hi>base Interest</hi>: If this be refused by the State, and yet Oaths be still press'd upon the <hi>Iacobites,</hi> and they be still Persecuted, Imprisoned, and put to Death, for performing their conscientious Duties to him whom they cannot but judge as yet to be their rightful Prince, then they do call Heaven and Earth to witness that they suffer for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> sake; and that the pretended Governours are resolved to ruine them, for no other Reason but that they will not, to second and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their unaccountable Authority, break God's holy Commands, and our own Laws; which all good <hi>Christians</hi> and true <hi>English-men</hi> are bound to observe.</p>
               <p>On the other side, their not yielding to this Humble Request cannot but redound highly to their Dishonour; for all thinking Man will easily make this Inference from their refusal, that either they do not judge they have any Title at all, which will <hi>bear the Test,</hi> or which they will <hi>stand to</hi>; or else, that they are most cruel and most unchristian Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: While, on the one hand, they refuse, when humbly Supplicated, to take Order to give satisfaction to Men's Consciences, in a Case which the many Controversies about it, and the former <hi>long settled</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> Title shews to be (at least) <hi>Dubious</hi>; and on the other side, they go on to punish and put Men to Death, who are <hi>desirous</hi> to be satisfied, merely for acting <hi>according to their Consciences</hi>; which those Men themselves are not able to satisfie, that they ought to submit volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to the Present Government; and those who should be <hi>most able</hi> are <hi>most concern'd,</hi> nay absolutely, in many regards, <hi>bound</hi> to do it, refuse them that Christian Charity.</p>
               <p>In a word, Let the Present Governours either <hi>satisfie</hi> our <hi>Consciences,</hi> or leave off to <hi>persecute</hi> us for being <hi>Conscientious</hi>; or, else (which is only left) let them speak out, and tell the World in plain Terms, what this refusal of theirs will sufficiently intimate, that they will do <hi>neither</hi>; but that they are resolved we shall be punish'd as <hi>Traitors,</hi> if we will not be <hi>Knaves</hi>; and that they will only allow us this sad Choice, to be either <hi>Hang'd</hi> or <hi>Damn'd.</hi>
