         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore let it be your care to keep your self neat and clean, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve every thing in Cookery that is done by your Superior or Head Cook, treasure it up in your memory, and when you meet with a convenient opportunity, put that in practice which you have observed, this course will advance you from a drudge, to be a Cook another day. Every one must have a beginning, and if you be ingenious and bend your mind to it, and be willing to learn, there is none will be so churlish or unkind, as to be unwilling to teach you,

but if you be stubborn and careless, and not give your mind to learn, who do you think will be willing to teach you; you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Gossips and Chairwomen, for they will misadvise you, take heed of the solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations of the flesh for they will undo you, and though you may have mean thoughts of your self, and think none will meddle with such as you, it is a mistake, for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brave Gallants will fall foul upon the Wench in the Scullery.</p>

            <p>THose who would endeavour to gain the esteem and reputation of good Dairy Maids, must be careful that all their Vessels be scalded well, and kept very clean, that they milk their Cattel in due time, for the Kine by custom will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it though you neglect, which will tend much to their detriment.</p>
            <p>The hours and times most approved, and commonly used for milking, are in the Spring and Summer time between five and six in the morning, and between six and seven in the evening: And in the Wint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r between seven and eight in the morning, and four and five in the ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ning.</p>
            <p>In the next place you must be careful that you do not waste your Cream by giving it away to liquorish persons.</p>
            <p>You must keep certain days for your chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and be sure to make up your Butter
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36982:89"/>
neatly and cleanly, washing it well from the Butter-milk and then salt it well.</p>
            <p>You must be careful to make your Cheeses good and tender by well ordering of them, and see that your Hogs have the Whey, and that it be not given away to Gossiping and idle people, who live merely upon what they can get from Servants.</p>
            <p>That you provide your winter Butter and Cheese in summer, as in May: And when your Rowings come in, be sparing of your fire and do not lavish away your Milk, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Cheese.</p>
            <p>If you have any Fowls to fat, look to them that it may be for your credit and not your shame, when they are brought to Table.</p>
            <p>When you milk the Cattel, stroke them well, and in the summer time save those strokings by themselves, to put into your Morning milk Cheese.</p>
            <p>I look upon it to be altogether needless, for to give you any directions for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Butter or Cheese, since there are very few, (especially in the Country) that can be ignorant thereof: I shall only say, that the best time to pot up Butter for win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is in the month of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
