            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>SInce the Dawning of the Heavenly Day and living Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the pure God, and Rising of his Glorious Son by his Light, Grace and <hi>Holy Spirit, many</hi> have been called and <hi>Convinced</hi> of the Truth and way of God, what it is, and how they might walk therein: This Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath been given to <hi>many,</hi> of God in and through <hi>Jesus, Christ,</hi> his Son, by his Light, Grace and Holy Spirit put and placed in the Hearts and Consciences of the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men.</p>
            <p>Now that which the Lord requires thereby, is <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> thereunto, according to the Knowledge so given, which is to <hi>deny Self,</hi> and take up and willingly bear the <hi>Cross</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> which Crucifies to the World, and the World to them with all its vile Affections and Lust; these come to know not only a <hi>Convinced Estate,</hi> but a <hi>Conversion</hi> in their Hearts and Souls.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Counsel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that in my Heart and Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, in Bowels of true Love, Tenderness and Compassion, and as a <hi>Faithful Warning</hi> also unto all such, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained (whether many Years, or few) under a <hi>Convincement,</hi> or in a <hi>Convinced Estate,</hi> is, <hi>That</hi> you carefully and in true fear <hi>yield pure Obedience unto God, according to the Knowledge he hath given you</hi> by his pure <hi>Light, Grace</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Sacrifice short of this, doth find Acceptance with him: who by the same lets you see, and accordingly teaches you <hi>what</hi> you shall <hi>deny your selves in</hi>: What you must part with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54576:3"/>
and forsake? What you should do, and what you should not in order to your <hi>Conversion</hi>: and <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say, as having a Stress upon my Spirit, in the Love of God unto all you, as before; <hi>Yield Obedience unto God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Knowledge you have received from him,</hi> and do no longer satisfie your selves, nor speak Peace to your selves, because you are <hi>Convinced</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and because you know the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> what it is, and so make a <hi>Profession</hi> thereof; think not that this <hi>Knowledge</hi> will serve your turn to justifie you in the sight of God, short of <hi>Obedience.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8.</note> For Christ himself, though he was the Son of God, he learned <hi>Obedience</hi>; and how much more ought the Sons and Daughters of Men learn <hi>Obedience,</hi> though never so Rich, Wise, Great and Potent in the World, or never so much Accounted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sons and Daughters of Men: That so through <hi>Obedience</hi> to the known Will and requirings of God, you may come to feel and be sensible of the work of his Power and Holy Spirit in your Hearts, there to Change you, to work, and <hi>Convert</hi> you into the nature of Truth, to the bearing of the Heavenly Image thereof: The working of which, as it's truly waited for and kept to (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Power, begets fear towards God, least such should disobey him, or grieve his good Spirit; and so effects Brokenness and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Heart and Spirit before the Lord, and works in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to lowliness of mind in carriage and Behaviour before all people; softens the hard Heart, brings down the high mind, and proud and lofty Spirit, and subjects the stiff and unruly will and Nature. And they who come to know this Work wrought in them, in order to their <hi>Conversion,</hi> come to know it in and under, and after their being so <hi>Convinced,</hi> they must and do come to know it through <hi>Judgement,</hi> which they must love, and patiently dwell in, if ever they come to know a <hi>Converted Estate.</hi> Through the same (to wit <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) be set up and kindled in their hearts as a <hi>Fire,</hi> and know the Word of God as a Sword and Hammer, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it must be loved: For so said the Prophet; <hi>How do I love thy Judgement</hi>: And Christ said, <hi>I will not break

the bruised Reed, nor quench the smoaking Flax,</hi> untill <hi>Judgement</hi> be brought forth unto <hi>Victory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So have a Care (all, who are <hi>Convinced,</hi> and do make a <hi>Confession</hi> to, and <hi>Profession</hi> of the Truth) of presuming upon the Mercies of the Lord in your <hi>Disobedience,</hi> and flying <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or that which <hi>Judgeth</hi> you because of your <hi>Disobedience,</hi> and flying the Cross.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Judgement,</hi> you must either know and love, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently dwell in and keep to, or else your hard Hearts you can nev<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I thus set forth unto you that the way of your Redemption out of Captivity and Spiritual Bondage, and to come to a <hi>Converted Estate</hi> must be in and through <hi>Judgement,</hi> and that as by a <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> or <hi>Sword,</hi> think it not hard; for i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'s the right Door to come in by to receive <hi>Mercy</hi> from the Lord's Hand; of whom it's said, <hi>He mixes mercy with judgement,</hi> (but then the <hi>Judgement</hi> must be owned.) And though many are they in number, that are living Witnesses, this has been the Way of the dealings of God with their Souls; and it was to them and to you in the Offers of it, <hi>Gods free Love,</hi> in and through Jesus Christ his Son, who said: <hi>For Judgment I am come into the World</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 5.22.</note> and all <hi>judgement</hi> is committed unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54576:4"/>So now all ye, who remain in a <hi>Convinced Estate,</hi> and live and act contrary to that which Convinceth you, ye should not there remain in Disobedience: for ye may see (if ye will but turn to your minds in fear towards God) the great Difference between a <hi>Convinced Estate,</hi> and a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Estate.</hi> For the Hearts, Souls and Spirits of those that are turn'd to God in Righteousness, and so truly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> and changed, and have known a Passing from Death unto Life the way I have shewed you, they are <hi>Broken-hearted, Lowly-minded,</hi> and in their Souls and Spirits there remains a true Tenderness; and such are concerned to set a watch before their Lips daily, that they may not offend with their Tongues! and not only in <hi>Words</hi> but in <hi>Actions</hi>; and that they may live the life of Truth they make profession of. And it's such that grows in Grace and Saving knowledge, and that prosper in their <hi>Gifts</hi> given unto them of the <hi>Free-giver</hi> (who fear him always) and that to his Praise and Glory, and their remaining Comfort and Souls sweet Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And therefore is it, that the Hearts of the <hi>truly Converted</hi> are sitted and prepared by the power of God to <hi>offer Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> unto him, that find Acceptance with him.</p>
            <p>But the Hearts of the Convinced, that live in Disobedience, and are not willing to bear the daily Cross, nor come under Judgement, are not so, but are hard; and their minds high, not Subject to the Yoke of Christ, nor willing to bear his burthen; and yet can satisfie your selves in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the People come,</hi>

               <hi>Children of thy People are still talking against thee by the Walls and in the Doors, saying one to another, and every man to his Brother, I pray you, let us hear the Word that cometh forth from the mouth of the Lord</hi>: Which although, as I have hinted, they <hi>confessed</hi> unto, and seemingly liked to hear, yet they were not willing to do accordingly. <hi>And when this cometh to pass (and it will, saith the Lord) they shall know there hath been a Prophet among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks it sounds in my Ears as though they spake mockingly or in derision, Scorn or dislike against the Prophet; and it were well if this proved not the Estate and Condition of too many <hi>Professing Truth</hi> in our day! But I fear and have a Godly Jealousie, and have seen and felt to much of it, in my Travels and various Exercises, that there are too many that undervalue and dis-esteem the <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Travel</hi> of <hi>Gods Servants, Ministers</hi> and <hi>Messengers,</hi> yea, the very Ancient and Elder Brethren, as well as the Younger, except they appear as these that are very Wise and Eloquent (though in the Life and Power) and by a proud, disdainfull Lordly Spirit, that is of an Earthly Savour, are often busying themselves, and <hi>Whispering,</hi> and <hi>tatling</hi> and <hi>talking</hi> against <hi>Faithful Brethren,</hi> that have born the burthen in the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Day.</hi> And if you can but espy any Failure or Weakness (as you think) in or by any of them, though but one of a Thousand, as to what you will take Liberties to your selves to do, and yet Justifie your selves therein, though readily <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>Condemn</hi> them, Do not you think thereby to Cover your Iniquity and Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For I must tell you in Love and true Tenderness, you will find your selves greatly mistaken &amp; deceived by the <hi>Enemy</hi> of your <hi>Souls</hi>; who through his Subtilty perswades you to believe his <hi>Lyes,</hi> and that in the day and time of your Account: For according to the Deeds done in your own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, or by your selves, so must your reward be, whether they be good or evil.</p>

            <p>The blessed Apostle came not with <hi>enticing Words of Mens wisdom,</hi> neither the words that <hi>Mens Wisdom</hi> teacheth; but in the Demonstration of the Power and Spirit of God: So they that exalt themselves, though never so <hi>high</hi> in <hi>words, excellent speeches,</hi> and <hi>Scholastick Terms,</hi> and though they be never so much cried up, the Lord will, as he has done, <hi>Cast down</hi> such; as by woful Experience too much it is to be seen by those that by a <hi>light airy spirit,</hi> notwithstanding their words have floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above the pure simplicity of the Gospel.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lvation thereof, as they are concerned for the Earth, and to heap up Riches they know not for whom, well might it be with many as to their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happiness.</p>
            <p>But being that such are many times, more concerned for the Assurance of the <hi>Terrestial,</hi> than the <hi>Celestial (viz.)</hi> more for the <hi>Earthly</hi> than the <hi>Heavenly,</hi> hence it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though such profess the Truth and the worship of God amongst his People, they grow very indifferent about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it: For they can scarce find any time to come to <hi>Meetings,</hi> but on the <hi>First Day.</hi> What differ these from the <hi>Professor</hi> and <hi>Prophane</hi> in the World?

And hence it is, that such are <hi>Dead, D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This is the Trick of all <hi>Idlers,</hi> that would <hi>Eat,</hi> but will not <hi>Work</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to <hi>judge and find many Faults</hi> with them that are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in their Labour and Concern; which maketh the Labour and Travel of God's faithful Servants, that have his Work to do, and his Word to speak, sometimes hard and uneasie,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54576:7"/>
because often the Work is great, and the Labourers but few: So it must needs lie heavy upon some, though censoriously judged for their Pains. Howbeit, notwithstanding some in our day, as the Prophet in his time, <hi>Labour in vain, and spend their strength for nought,</hi> as to effect good to the unconcerned; yet their Peace is with the Lord, and their reward cometh from him; Praises, pure Honour and Glory be given to his Holy Name and great Power for evermore, faith my Soul, who will not have any to shut a Door in his House for nought.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54576:9"/>And now <hi>Friends,</hi> unto you that are <hi>Parents,</hi> and that have <hi>Children,</hi> I have something to say both to <hi>you,</hi> and your <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the first place, the concern that is upon my mind, and hath often and long remained, Is to give you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a little of my own Experience and concern in <hi>Ordering</hi> and <hi>Framing</hi> up of my own <hi>Children,</hi> that if happily it may tend to stir up those, or such as may be short in their <hi>Duty</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When it pleased the Lord to give me <hi>Children,</hi> as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from his hand (amongst many more I have received from him) as my <hi>Children</hi> grew up, a concern many times, very weighty, (the Lords knows) seized upon my mind, both upon my Bed, and many other times, what way I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my self to Train up my <hi>Children,</hi> as did become the Truth, and that might become a Blessing to them, and a Comfort to us their <hi>Parents.</hi> And accordingly I saw it my way, as much as in me lay, that as they grew up in years, to mind and take diligent notice of their <hi>Natural Inclination,</hi> or what it was they most <hi>naturally Inclined</hi> unto: and when I saw any one of them to <hi>Incline</hi> to any thing in <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that under a serious Consideration was not like to prove, if it was suffered to grow or increase, either to be good for their <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> (for that which is not good for the <hi>Soul,</hi> it cannot be good for the <hi>Body</hi>) it greatly became my concern to restrain them from that when it was but little and small, and when they were <hi>young</hi>; so that it was both easie for me to do, and them to get over. And when I found any thing of <hi>stubb<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> get up in them, contrary to the Counsel and Advice I had given them. I did not let <hi>foolish pity</hi> prevent due <hi>Admonition</hi> and Correction, though I dearly and tenderly did and do <hi>love</hi> them all.</p>
            <p>But some spoil their <hi>Children,</hi> in letting them have their <hi>wills</hi> so much, that they become disobedient <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd rebellious, and so give away their Power so much to the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Child,</hi> and lessen their Authority: That as sometimes I have heard to the grief of my Soul, <hi>Parents</hi> say to their <hi>Children,</hi> Do such a thing; they have replied, (<hi>I will not</hi>) and whether ought the <hi>Child,</hi> that doth not yet understand what's good either for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54576:9"/>
its <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> to have its <hi>Will</hi>? Or ought not the <hi>Parents</hi> rather to Constrain them to do what they know is good for them, though they be <hi>stiff</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi>! That so, what way or course in after-time their <hi>Children</hi> may take when they are from under their power, the <hi>Parents</hi> may be clear of their <hi>Children</hi> in the day of their Account.</p>
            <p>I say, my great concern was many times, how I might <hi>Train</hi> up my <hi>Children,</hi> as did become the <hi>Truth,</hi> chiefly in what might be good for their <hi>Souls</hi>; relying upon Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for other things, as he did see good. And as they came up in their tender Years one after another, in the Fear of God, I laboured what in me lay, not only by <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> and timely Endeavours, to restrain the <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and keep them out of and from every thing, that had an evil tendency in it; but also what in me lay, to beget <hi>Love</hi> in them to Truth and <hi>Friends,</hi> and one to another.</p>
            <p>And so, as they grew up in years, did encourage them to go to <hi>Meetings</hi>: And I hope I may say without offence, my <hi>Endeavours</hi> (with the Blessing of God) hath wrought a good <hi>Effect</hi> in my <hi>Children</hi> to this day, I bless the Lord for it; and I never durst put them forward to <hi>Play,</hi> as some do; and when they had a Capacity, Educated them in reading the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures and Friends Books: And always had and have a care to keep them out of the vain Fashions of the World; neither could I ever suffer them to go to see or behold any <hi>Sport, Game,</hi> or <hi>Pastime,</hi> or <hi>Play,</hi> that tends to nothing but stirring up of the vain, light mind, and letting loose the <hi>wild Nature,</hi> and corrupting of Youth. And it was my great Care and concern, to be a <hi>good Example,</hi> before them and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, according to the Counsel I had often given them. And hence it is, where this Care in Carriage and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in Parents before their Children is a wanting, though such <hi>Parents</hi> may profess the <hi>Truth,</hi> it tends to drive their <hi>Children</hi> farther from it, and hardens their Hearts, and so they grow <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>wanton, proud</hi> and <hi>high minded</hi>; and as they get up, run to <hi>Sports</hi> (and <hi>Plays,</hi> and to <hi>Drinking</hi> and <hi>Tippling</hi>) amongst the wild Rabble, as I have seen, to the grief of my Soul, in Towns and other places; and going to <hi>Cock fights</hi> and <hi>Bull-baitings,</hi> and to stand amongst wild rude People, spying a <hi>Fool</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:54576:10"/>
and <hi>Mounte-bank,</hi> acting Folly and Madness upon a Stage or Rope; against which God's Anger at sometimes by eminent Judgements hath been manifested.</p>
            <p>As for Example and Proof: at a certain time, when a Person had acted his <hi>Folly</hi> upon a <hi>Rope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Example.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>a Wall suddenly fell upon many people s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me struck Dead and spoke no more, others their Backs and Legs broken, and others sorely hurt and Maimed, and Bruised, that their blood came out at their mouths.</hi> Therefore let the remembrance of this dread all people, so as not to love or delight to behold Vanity, or such like folly and Madness.</p>
            <p>The Godly care of <hi>Parents</hi> in time, to train up their <hi>Children</hi> in the fear of the Lord, and as becomes the Truth, ought to be diligently exercised; for where that's wanting, these disorders too often appear in their Children, that they grow up in <hi>wildness</hi> and <hi>wan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onness,</hi> and in their behaviour and <hi>Apparel</hi> to follow the bad ways, courses and Antick <hi>Fashions</hi> of the World. But who durst do such things in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? and Truth is the same; though too many give to their Children, and take to themselves that Liberty that they durst not, nor would truth ever allow of; though I know many neither can, nor do allow, nor give such Liberty, neither to themselves, nor their Children; And blessed and happy are they that so discharge their Duty for that end, they may be clear in the discharge thereof, in the day and time of their Account, which they cannot be, that do to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Guardians</hi> of Children, discharge your selves in your Duty to your Children, or those with whom you are concerned; and do not think to excuse your selves with saying, <hi>There is great difference of Children's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>: It's true there is; but your indulging of them, and Winking and Conniving at their running out into Vanity and Wildness, makes their Natures worse, and your Children more untruth-like; and you are greatly in the blame.</p>
            <p>How comes it to pass that so many Children of those that profess the Truth, are scarce come so far as to use the plain Language? What think you, that if you be Rich, and have great Portions for them, will this make them blessed and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54576:10"/>
happy? And must they not therefore have their wills crost? Consider, that they are Rich that God owns and loves, and poor and miserable that he rejects; and they are Rich that are Rích in Faith and good Works towards him, notwithstanding poor in this world.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psalm.</hi> 62.10.</note> And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet said, <hi>If riches increase, set not thy Heart upon them;<note>
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.</note> for they will make themselves Wings and fly away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Friends,</hi> take Counsel and be Advised in Bowels of true Love by your <hi>Friend,</hi> that wisheth both <hi>you</hi> and your <hi>Children</hi> Happiness both here and hereafter. And Train up your <hi>Children</hi> in the Fear of the Lord in all things, as becomes the <hi>Truth</hi> you make <hi>Profession</hi> of: and withal, be sure you be a <hi>good Example</hi> before them, and unto them.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Children</hi> be subject unto your <hi>Parents</hi> in that which is good,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3.</note> and none be Stubborn and Rebellious: for in the end, if you do, it will prove your own hurt and loss.<note>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3.20.</note> And if any of your <hi>Parents</hi> shew forth any evil example before you, take not Liberty thereby to do any thing that is evil or to speak evil of Truth, nor to neglect Meetings; nor none to satisfie your selves with going to Meetings barely, because your <hi>Parents</hi> go, if you can but have Liberty to your Wills, and do and have what pleaseth you: This is not good for your Souls Health, though you want nothing for your Bodies neither will it make for your Peace with the Lord, when you must be separated from all Wordly enjoyment.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Dear Children,</hi> take my Counsel and give ear to my Friendly and tender advice in true love unto you: let it be the concern of your minds chiefly in going to Meetings, with diligence to wait in the fear of the Lord, to feel the Work of his Power in your Hearts to change your Nature, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject your Wills to do the will of God, to the weaning of your minds from delighting in <hi>Sport</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> or any <hi>Game</hi> or <hi>Pastime,</hi> or Fine <hi>Apparel,</hi> or in earthly <hi>Substance</hi>; that so there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to wit, by the work of the Heavenly Power of God your Hearts may be wrought into true tenderness and brokenness, and Minds and Spirits into Lowliness and Humility before him; So will you feel <hi>Love</hi> to increase and abound in your
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54576:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hearts towards <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>People</hi>; and so will you come, as you carefully mind the shinings of the pure <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and Teachings of his Gracious Spirit, which will manifest all that which is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vil in every Appearance of it unto you, and teach you to do that which is good in <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Action.</hi> I say, this is the way for you to come out of <hi>Childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Childish things,</hi> and all manner of Disobedience both towards <hi>God</hi> and your <hi>Parents,</hi> and to be weaned from all the <hi>Vanities</hi> and <hi>Pleasures, Customs</hi> and <hi>Fashions</hi> of the World; so that you will have no delight in keeping Company with any but such as fear the Lord, which will greatly tend to your Happiness and Prosperity both in this Life and that which is to come, as that which teacheth you his Fear, is by you kept in, That so God alone may be Honoured and glorified by you, and you may be a comfort to your Parents; and the greatest of all in the end will be your own. Unto which the Lord preserve and keep you in his fear in all faithfulness, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that knowledge, more or less, that you have received from him, out of the Evil that is in the World, is the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prayer, and Souls well-wishing of <hi>your Friend,</hi> both for <hi>You,</hi> and your <hi>Parents,</hi> as for my self and my own Chiidren, in discharge of my <hi>Duty</hi> in the Love of God.
