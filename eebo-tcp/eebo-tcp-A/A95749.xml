         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſcope of this
Treatiſe is (for the
weal of the publick,
in the propagation
of learning &amp; vertue through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Iſle of great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain)</hi>
in all humility to intreat
the honorable Parliament of this
Commonwealth, with conſent
of the Councel of State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to grant to Sir <hi>Thomas Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quhart</hi>
of <hi>Cromarty</hi> his former
liberty, and the enjoyment of
<pb facs="tcp:115875:4"/>
his own inheritance, with all
the immunities and priviledges
thereto belonging. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of this demand in an unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
(though compoſitive) way,
are ſo methodically deduced,
that their recapitulation here
(how curt ſoever I could make
it) would afford but little more
compendiouſneſs to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
unleſs all were to be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
up in this, that ſeeing the
obtaining of his deſires would
be conducible to the whole
Land, and prejudicial to no
good member in it, he ſhould
therefore be favoured with the
benefit of the grant thereof,
and refuſal of nothing apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115875:4"/>
By reaſon of his being a <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
man, a great deal therein is
ſpoken in favor of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and many pregnant argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inferred for the incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
of both nations into one,
with an indiſſolubility of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the future, in an identity
of priviledges, laws &amp; cuſtoms.
As by the praiſing of many the
coetaneans and compatriots of
his no-leſs-deſerving predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
<hi>Scotland</hi> is much honored:
ſo, to vindicate the reputation
thereof from any late ſcandal,
it is fitly repreſented how the
miſcariage of a few ſhould not
occaſion an univerſal imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The unjuſt uſurpation
<pb facs="tcp:115875:5"/>
of the Clergy, the Judaical
practices of ſome Merchants,
and abuſed ſimplicity of the
gentry, have in the mindes of
forraigners engraven a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
opinion of that Nation,
which will never be wiped off
under a Presbyterial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for where ever it bears
ſway, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here I muſt ſtop; for
ſhould I give way to my pen to
decipher the enormities of that
rule, I would, by outbulking
the book with this Epiſtle,
make the porch greater then
the lodging; enter into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
longer then the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and outſtrip the period
with the parentheſis. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:115875:5"/>
out of that inclination which
prompts me to conceal the
faults of thoſe, in whom there
may be any hope of a cordial
penitency for having commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them; I will not at this
time lanch forth into the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
depth of Presbyterian
plots, nor rip up the ſores of
their Eccleſiaſtical tyranny, till
their implacable obduredneſs,
and unreclaimability of nature,
give open teſtimonies of their
ſtanding to their firſt erroneous
principles, and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
a ſubordination to a
ſecular authority.</p>
            <p>For the preſent then, it ſhall
ſuffice, that I beſtow upon them
<pb facs="tcp:115875:6"/>
a gentle admonition, to refrain
from that ambitious deſigne of
ſpiritual ſoveraignty; or (to
uſe the phraſe of their patron
<hi>Knox)</hi> that I warn them with
the firſt ſound of the trumpet,
to give the civil Magiſtrate his
due: but if after this <hi>Dian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding,</hi>
they (inſtead of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
their conſciences with
the garment of righteouſneſs)
come forth to the field of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
affaires, with their ruſty
armor of iniquity; then let them
not blame me, if for the love
of my country, whoſe honour
they have defaced, and the beſt
inhabitants whereof they have
born down with oppreſſion, I
<pb facs="tcp:115875:6"/>
refuſe not the employment of
taking up banner againſt them,
and giving them a home charge
with <hi>clareens,</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of reaſon and common
ſenſe, their old and inveterate
enemies. Now ſeeing that in
this introitory diſcourſe (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the excurſive pomp of a
too large ranging at random) I
am limited to ſome few pages,
ſhould I employ them all to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Presbyters greatneſs, it
would argue in me great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideracy,
in preferring him
to his betters; therefore till I
have the leiſure to beſtow a
whole ſheet by it ſelf upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Sir <hi>John</hi> (who in that kind
<pb facs="tcp:115875:7"/>
of liberality towards the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator

<hi>Non-pareil</hi> of the world) that
therein (as in a habit of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
he may be expoſed to the
publike view of the honeſt men
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom he hath ſo
much injured: I muſt confine
my ſelf now to ſo much bounds
(without more) as barely may
ſuffice to excuſe the ſuperficial
<hi>errata's</hi> both of pen and preſs.</p>
            <p>This Treatiſe (like the words
of maſs, dinner, ſupper, and
ſuch like, which beſides the

an <hi>Engliſh</hi> gariſon; and whoſe

<pb facs="tcp:115875:8"/>

for the Preſs at firſt, but
5 ſheets, <hi>viz.</hi> the three firſt, and
ſome two about the latter end,
I deemed the aforeſaid time of
two weeks, of extent ſufficient
for encompaſſing a work of ſo
ſhort a breath. But by chance
two <hi>Diurnals</hi> having been
brought to me, in one whereof
was contained the relation of
the irrational prooceedings of
the Presbytery of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Sir <hi>Alexander Iruin</hi> of
<hi>Drum,</hi> together with his juſt
appeal from their tyrannical
juriſdiction to <hi>Colonel Overton,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115875:8"/>
the then only competent judge
that was there; and in the other
a petition or grievance of the
commons of <hi>Scotland,</hi> againſt
the mercileſs and cruel task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters
that the Presbyterian

many yeers paſt; wherein (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that petition was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious,

might not be teſtified by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of honeſt people in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ten times more of

and beſides all that, there

other ſuchlike indignities fixed
upon the whole Nation for the

on a ſudden (for the undeceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of their minds with a

to inſert the martial and

much eclipſed by their <hi>coclima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>

            <p>Thus my task increaſing, and

<pb facs="tcp:115875:10"/>
glad to tear off parcels of
ten or twelve lines a peece, and
give him them, till more were
ready; unto which he would ſo
ſuddenly put an order, that
almoſt ſtill, before the ink of
the writen letters was dry, their
repreſentatives were (out of
their reſpective boxes) ranked
in the Compoſing-ſtick; by
means of which great haſte, I
writing but upon the looſe
ſheets of cording-quires, which
(as I minced &amp; tore them) loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
like pieces of waſte paper,
troubleſome to get rallyed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch diſperſive ſcattredneſs,
I had not the leiſure to read
what I had written, till it came
<pb facs="tcp:115875:11"/>
to a proof, and ſometimes to
a full reviſe: ſo that by vertue
of this unanimous conteſt,
and joint emulation betwixt
the <hi>theoretick</hi> and <hi>practical</hi>
part, which of us ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hye
other in celerity, we in the
ſpace of fourteen working-daies,
compleated this whole
book (ſuch as it is) from the
firſt notion of the brain, till
the laſt motion of the preſs;
And that without any other
help on my ſide, either of
quick or dead (for books I
had none, nor poſſibly would
I have made uſe of any, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I could have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them) then what (by the
<pb facs="tcp:115875:11"/>
favour of God) my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fancy did ſuggeſt
unto me; ſave ſo much as, by
way of information, a ſervant
of mine would now and then
bring to me, from ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
Officer of the primitive
Parliament, touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
names of ſome <hi>Scotiſh</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
abroad, which I was very
apt to forget.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not this to excuſe
groſs faults (if there be any)
nor yet to praiſe my owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs
(though there were
none) but to ſhew that extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraneanneſs,
in ſome kinde of
ſubjects, may very probably
be more ſucceſſeful, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation:
<pb facs="tcp:115875:12"/>
and that a too
punctually digeſted method,
and over-nicely ſelected phraſe,
ſavouring of affectation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh
oftentimes very much of
the grace that otherwayes
would attend a natural ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.

yet immediately thereafter, when upon Carts

to the Country, and that by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of many hundreds of both horſe and foot,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115875:19"/>
whom they had loaded with ſpoil, they were
aſſaulted with the temptation of a new booty,
they apprehending how uſeful the paper might
be unto them, went back for it, and bore it
ſtraight away: which done, to every one of
thoſe their Camarads whom they met with in
the ſtreets, they gave as much thereof, for
packeting up of Raiſins, Figs, Dates, Almonds,
Caraway, and other ſuch-like dry Confections
and other ware, as was requiſite: who doing
the ſame themſelves, did, together with others,
kindle pipes of Tobacco with a great part
thereof, and threw out all the remainder upon
the ſtreets, ſave ſo much as they deemed neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for inferiour employments, and poſteriour
uſes.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe diſperſedly-rejected bundles of
paper, ſome were gathered up by Grocers,
Druggiſts, Chandlers, Pie-makers, or ſuch as
ſtood in need of any cartapaciatory utenſil,
and put in preſent ſervice, to the utter undoing
of all the writing thereof, both in its matter
and order. One Quinternion nevertheleſs, two
days after the fight on the <hi>Friday</hi>-morning,
together with two other looſe ſheets more,
by vertue of a drizelling rain, which had
made it ſtick faſt to the ground, where there
was a heap of ſeven and twenty dead men,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115875:20"/>
lying upon one another, was by the command
of one Maſter <hi>Braughton</hi> taken up by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of his; who, after he had (in the beſt
manner he could) cleanſed it from the mire
and mud of the kennel, did forthwith prefent
it to the peruſal of his Maſter; in whoſe hands
it no ſooner came, but inſtantly perceiving by
the periodical couching of the diſcourſe, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
figures, and breaks here and there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the variety of the Subject, that
the whole purpoſe was deſtinated for the
Preſs, and by the Author put into a garb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
either the Stationer or Printer's accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
Yet becauſe it ſeemed imperfect, and
to have relation to ſubſequent Tractates, he
made all the enquiry he could, for trial, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were any more ſuch Quinternions
or no: by means whereof, he got full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
that above three thouſand ſheets of
the like Paper, written after that faſhion, and
with the ſame hand, were utterly loſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzeled
after the manner aforeſaid; and was
ſo fully aſſured of the misfortune, that, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
up ſpilt water, comprehend the windes
within his fiſt, and recover thoſe Papers again,
he thought would be a work of one and the
ſame labour and facility. Therefore, becauſe
he deſpaired of attaining to any more, he the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115875:20"/>
more carefully endeavoured to preſerve what
he had made purchaſe of: and this he did
very heedfully, in the Country for three
months together, and afterwards in the City
of <hi>London;</hi> where at laſt I getting notice
thereof, thought good, in regard of the great
moan made for the loſs of Sir <hi>Thomas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rqu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart</hi>'s
Manuſcripts, to try at the ſaid Sir
<hi>Thomas,</hi> whether theſe ſeven ſheets were any
of his Papers or no. Whereupon, after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with him, it was found that they
were but a parcel of the Preface he intended
to premiſe before the Grammar and Lexicon
of an Univerſal Language; the whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
conſiſting of two quires of paper, the
Grammar of three, and the Lexicon of ſeven:
the other fiveſcore &amp; ſixteen quires and a half
treating of Metaphyſical, Mathematical, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
Mythological, Epigrammatical, Dialecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and Chronological matters, in a way never
hitherto trod upon by any; being brought by
the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> into <hi>England</hi> for two
reaſons: Firſt, leſt they ſhould have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
loſt at <hi>Sterlin;</hi> and next, to have
them printed at <hi>London,</hi> with the beſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie
that might ſtand with the indemnity of
the Author; whom when I had asked if his
fancie could ſerve him to make up theſe Papers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115875:21"/>
again, eſpecially in ſo far as concerned the
New Language; His anſwer was, that, if he
wanted not encouragement, with the favour
of a littie time, he could do much therein:
but unleſs he were ſure to poſſeſs his own with
freedom, it would be impoſſible for him to
accompliſh a task of ſo great moment and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſneſs.
This modeſt reply, grounded
upon ſo much reaſon, hath emboldened me to
ſubjoyn hereto what was couched in thoſe
papers which were found by Maſter <hi>Braugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi>
to the end the Reader may perceive,
whether the performance of ſo great a Work
as is mentioned there, be not worth the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

be, as ſuch, directed to any other end, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be articulate or inarticulate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All things are either real or rational:
and the real, either natural or artificial.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There ought to be a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the ſigne and thing ſignified; therefore
ſhould all things, whether real or rational,
have their proper words aſſigned unto
them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Man is called a <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> becauſe
he may by his conceptions and words containe
within him the repreſentatives of what
in the whole world is comprehended.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Seeing there is in nature ſuch affinity
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115875:22"/>
'twixt words and things, as there ought to be
in whatever is ordained for one another; that
Language is to be accounted moſt conform to

all manner of things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As all things of a ſingle compleat being,
by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> into ten Claſſes were divided;
ſo may the words whereby thoſe things are to
be ſignified, be ſet apart in their ſeveral ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Arts, Sciences, Mechanick Trades,
notional Faculties, and whatever is excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by man, have their own method; by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof, the Learned of theſe latter times
have orderly digeſted them: Yet hath none
hitherto conſidered of a mark, whereby

            <p n="8">8. A Tree will be known by its leaves, a
Stone by its grit, a Flower by the ſmel, Meats
by the taſte, Muſick by the ear, Colours by
the eye, the ſeveral Natures of things, with
their properties and eſſential qualities, by the
Intellect: and accordingly as the things are in

man, after he hath conceived them aright,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115875:23"/>

thoſe things are expreſſed, no Language ever
hitherto framed, hath obſerved any order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the thing ſignified by them: for if
the words be ranked in their Alphabetical
ſeries, the things repreſented by them will fall
to be in ſeveral predicaments; and if the
things themſelves be categorically claſſed, the
word whereby they are made known will
not be tyed to any Alphabetical rule.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This is an imperfection incident to all
the Languages that ever yet have been
known: by reaſon whereof, Foraign Tongues
are ſaid to be hard to learn; and, when obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
eaſily forgot.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The effigies of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the likeneſs
of a Bull, ſhould be liker to that of <hi>Io</hi> meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed

<hi>Bucephalus,</hi> which was a horſe: and the

reſemblance with that of <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> being
both handſome men, then with the image of
<hi>Therſites,</hi> who was of a deformed feature:
juſt ſo ſhould things ſemblable in Nature be
repreſented by words of a like compoſure: and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115875:23"/>
as the true intelligible ſpeices do preſent unto
our minds the ſimilitude of things as they are
in the object; even ſo ought the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
of our conceptions ſo to agree or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in their contexture, as the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
which are conceived by them do in their

            <p n="12">12. Beſides this imperfection in all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
there is yet another, That no Language
upon the face of the earth hath a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Alphabet; one lacking thoſe letters which
another hath, none having all, and all of them
<hi>in cumulo</hi> lacking ſome. But that which makes
the defect ſo much the greater, is, that theſe
ſame few conſonants and vowels commonly
made uſe of, are never by two Nations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
after the ſame faſhion; the French A
with the Engliſh, being the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and
the Italian B with the Spaniſh, the Hebrew
Vau.</p>
            <p n="13">13. This is that which maketh thoſe of
one dominion ſo unskilful in the <hi>idiome</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and after many yeers abode in a ſtrange
land, deſpaire from attaining at any time to
the perfect accent of the language thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
as the waters of that ſtream cannot be
wholeſome, whoſe ſource is corrupted; nor
the ſuperſtructure ſure, whereof the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115875:24"/>
is ruinous: ſo doth the various manner
of pronouncing one and the ſame Alphabet in
ſeveral Nations, produce this great and
moſt lamentable obſtruction in the Diſcipline
of Languages.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The G of the Latin word <hi>legit,</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
four ſeveral manners pronounced by the
Engliſh, French, Spaniſh, and Dutch: the
Ch likewiſe is differently pronounced by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Nations; ſome uttering it after the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Hebrew Shin, as the French do in
the word <hi>chaſteau, chaſcun, chaſtier, chatel;</hi>
or like the Greek Kappa, as in the Italian
words, <hi>chiedere, chiazzare, chinatura;</hi> or as
in <hi>Italy</hi> are ſounded the words <hi>ciaſcheduno,
ciarlatano;</hi> for ſo do the Spaniſh and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
pronounce it, as in the words <hi>achaque,
leche; chamber, chance:</hi> other Nations of
a guttural flexibility, pronounce it after the
faſhion of the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Nor need we to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
for examples in other letters; for there is
ſcarce any hitherto received, either conſonant
or vowel, which in ſome one and other taking
in all Nations, is not pronounced after three or
four ſeveral faſhions.</p>
            <p n="15">15. As the Alphabets are imperfect,
ſome having but 19 letters, others 22. and
ſome 24. few exceeding that number: ſo do
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115875:24"/>
the words compoſed of thoſe letters in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Languages, come far ſhort of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of things, which to have the reputation
of a perfect tongue, ought to be expreſſed by
them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. For ſupply of this deficiencie, each
Language borrows from another; nor is
the perfecteſt amongſt them, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beholden to another, in all things enunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
baſtant to afford inſtruction: many Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical
and Medicinal terms have the Greeks
borrowed from the Arabians, for which they
by exchange have from the Grecians received
payment of many words naturalized in their
Phyſical, Logical, and Metaphyſical Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes.
As for the Latin, it oweth all its Scienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
dictions to the Greek and Arabick: yet
did the Roman Conqueſt give adoption to
many Latin words, in both theſe languages,
eſpecially in matters of military diſcipline, and
prudential Law.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And as for all other Languages as
yet ſpoke, though to ſome of them be aſcribed
the title of original Tongues, I may ſafely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch
there is none of them which of it ſelf
alone is able to afford the ſmattring of an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
fit for indoctrinating of us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and maximes of moral and intellectual
vertues.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115875:25"/>
18. But, which is more, and that which
moſt of all evinceth the ſterility of all the
Languages that ſince the Deluge have been
ſpoke, though all of them were quinteſcenced
in one capable of the perfections of each, yet
that one ſo befitted and accommodated for
compendiouſneſs and variety of phraſe, ſhould
not be able, amidſt ſo great wealth, to afford,
without circumlocution, the proper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
repreſentation of a thing, yea of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands of things, whereof each ſhould
be expreſſed with one ſingle word alone.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Some Languages have copiouſneſs of
diſcourſe, which are barren in compoſition:
ſuch is the Latine. Others are compendious
in expreſſion, which hardly have any flection
at all: of this kinde are the Dutch, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and Iriſh.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Greek hath the agglutinative faculty
of incorporating words; yet runneth not ſo
glib in Poeſie as doth the Latine, though far
more abundant. The Hebrew likewiſe, with
its auxiliary Dialects of Arabick, Caldean,
Syriack, Aethiopian, and Samaritan, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
prettily, and hath ſome ſtore of
words; yet falleth ſhort by many ſtages of the
Greek.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The French, Spaniſh, and Italians, are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115875:25"/>
but Dialects of the Latine, as the Engliſh is
of the Saxon Tongue; though with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
that the mixture of Latine with the
Gauliſh, Moreſco, and Gotiſh Tongues, make
up the three firſt Languages; but the meer qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of the Saxon with the old Britiſh,
frameth not the Engliſh to the full, for that,
by its promiſcuous and ubiquitary borrowing,
it conſiſteth almoſt of all Languages: which
I ſpeak not in diſpraiſe thereof, although I
may with confidence aver, that were all the
four aforeſaid Languages ſtript of what is not
originally their own, we ſhould not be able
with them all, in any part of the world, to
purchaſe ſo much as our breakfaſt in a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Now to return from theſe to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Languages; we muſt acknowledge it to
be very ſtrange, why, after thouſands of yeers
continual practice in the poliſhing of them by
men of approved faculties, there is neither in
them, nor any other Tongue hitherto found
out, one ſingle word expreſſive of the vice op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
either to Temperance or Chaſtity in the
defect; though many rigid Monks, even now
adays, be guilty of the one, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> of
old was of the other.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But that which makes this diſeaſe the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115875:26"/>
more incurable, is, that when an exuberant
ſpirit would to any high reſearched conceit
adapt a peculiar word of his own coyning,
he is branded with Incivility, if he apologize
not for his boldneſs, with a <hi>Quod ita dixerim
parcant Ciceronianae manes, Ignoſcat De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenis
genius,</hi> and other ſuch phraſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
his fault of making uſe of words
never uttered by others, or at leaſt by ſuch as
were moſt renowned for eloquence.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Though Learning ſuſtain great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
by this reſtraint of liberty to endenizon
new Citizens in the Commonwealth of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
yet do I conceive the reaſon thereof
to proceed from this, That it is thought a leſs
incongruity to expreſs a thing by circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then by appropriating a ſingle word
thereto, to tranſgreſs the bounds of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
as in Architecture it is eſteemed an
errour of leſs conſequence to make a circuitory
paſſage from one room to another, then by
the extravagancie of an irregular ſallie, to
frame projectures diſproportionable to the
found of the houſe.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Thus is it, that as according to the
largeneſs of the plat of a building, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactedneſs
of its walls, the Work-maſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triveth
his roofs, platforms, outjettings, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115875:26"/>
other ſuch like parts and portions of the
whole: juſt ſo, conform to the extent and
reach which a Language in its flexions and
compoſitions hath obtained at firſt, have the
ſpruceſt Linguiſts hitherto bin pleaſed to make
uſe of the words thereto belonging.</p>
            <p n="26">26. The Bonification and virtuification
of <hi>Lully, Scotus</hi>'s Hexeity, and Albedineity
of <hi>Suarez</hi> are words exploded by thoſe that
affect the purity of the Latine diction; yet
if ſuch were demanded, what other no leſs
conciſe expreſſion would comport with the
neatneſs of that language, their anſwer would
be <hi>altum ſilentium:</hi> ſo eaſie a matter it is for
many to finde fault with what they are not
able to amend.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Nevertheleſs, why for repreſenting to
our underſtandings the eſſence of accidents,
the fluency of the form, as it is <hi>in fieri;</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the Agent, and habit that facilitates it,
with many thouſands of other ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the tearms are not ſo genuine, as of the
members of a mans body, or utenſils of his
houſe; the reaſon is, becauſe the firſt inventers
of Languages, who contrived them for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
were not ſo profoundly verſed in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
quiddities, as thoſe that ſucceeded
after them; whoſe literature increaſing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115875:27"/>
their excurſion beyond the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the common objects imagined by their
forefathers.</p>
            <p n="28">28. I have known ſome to have built
houſes for neceſſity, having no other aime
before their eyes, but barely to dwell in them;
who nevertheleſs in a very ſhort ſpace were ſo
enriched, that after they had taken pleaſure
to poliſh and adorn, what formerly they had
but rudely ſquared, their moveables ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
upon them, that they would have
wiſhed they had made them of a larger
extent.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Even ſo though theſe Languages may
be refined by ſome quaint derivatives and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
compoſitions; like the ſtriking forth of new
lights and doors, outjetting of kernels, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
of prickets, barbicans, and ſuch like
various ſtructures upon one and the ſame
foundation; yet being limited to a certain
baſis<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> beyond which the verſed in them muſt
not paſs, they cannot roam at ſuch random
as otherwiſe they might, had their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
been of a larger ſcope at firſt.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Thus albeit Latine be far better poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
now, then it was in the days of <hi>Enntus</hi> and
<hi>Livius Andronicus,</hi> Yet had the Latiniſts at
firſt been ſuch Philoſophers as afterward they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115875:27"/>
were, it would have attained to a great deale
of more perfection then it is at for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p n="31">31. What I have delivered in freedome of
the learned Languages, I would not have
wreſted to a ſiniſter ſenſe, as if I meant any
thing to their diſparagement; for truly I think
the time well beſtowed, which boyes in their
tender yeers employ towards the learning of
them, in a ſubordination to the excellent things
that in them are couched.</p>
            <p n="32">32. But ingenuouſly I muſt acknowledge
my averſeneſs of opinion from thoſe who
are ſo ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to theſe Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
that they account it learning enough to
ſpeak them, although they knew nothing elſe;
which is an error worthy rebuke, ſeeing <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophia
ſunt res, non verba;</hi> and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the ſignes be, the things by them ſignified
ought ſtill to be of greater worth.</p>
            <p n="33">33. For it boots not ſo much, by what
kind of tokens any matter be brought into our
minde, as that the things made known unto
us, by ſuch repreſentatives, be of ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
value: not much unlike the Innes-a-court-gentlemen

the fare be good) then if they were warned to
courſer cates, by the ſound of a Bell or
Trumpet.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Another reaſon prompteth me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
which is this, That in this frozen Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of ours, there is hardly any that is not
poſſeſſed with the opinion, that not only the
three fore-named Languages, but a great
many other, whom they call Originals (whereof
they reckon ten or eleven in Europe, and ſome
fifty eight more, or thereabouts, in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
were at the confuſion of Babel, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by a miracle, infuſed into
men: being induced to believe this, not ſo
much for that they had not peruſed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the Rabbies on that text, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the miſunderſtanding whereunto the
builders were involved by diverſity of ſpeech,
to have proceeded from nothing elſe, but their
various and diſerepant pronunciation of one
and the ſame Language, as that they deemed
Languages to be of an invention ſo ſublime,
that naturally the wit of man was not able to
reach their compoſure.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Some believe this ſo pertinaciouſly,
that they eſteem all men infidels that are of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
faith; whilſt in the mean while, I may
confidently aſſever, that the aſſertors of ſuch a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115875:28"/>
tenet, do thereby extreamly diſhonor God,
who doing whatever is done, by nature, as the
actions of an Ambaſſador (as an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor)
are reputed to be thoſe of the Soveraign
that ſent him, would not have the power he
hath given to nature to be diſclaimed by
any, or any thing ſaid by us in derogation
thereof.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Should we deny our obedience to the

            </p>
            <p n="37">37. There are of thoſe with us, that wear

and <hi>Aeſculapius;</hi> who when they ſee
an Eclipſe of the Sun or Moon, or a Comet

            <p n="59">59. The analogie therein 'twixt the ſigne

that as, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there can be
no more worlds but one, becauſe all the matter
whereof worlds can be compoſed, is in this: ſo
can there be no Univerſal Language, but this
I am about to divulge unto the world, becauſe
all the words enuncible are in it contained.</p>

of that, for the furtherance of Philoſophy,

hitherto hath been ſo much as thought upon

there is no innovation in the eſſence of natural

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115875:32"/>
that others after me, may fall upon ſome
ſtraine of another kind, never, before that,
dreamed upon by thoſe of foregoing ages.</p>
            <p n="70">70. Now to the end the reader may be
more enamored of the Language, wherein I
am to publiſh a Grammer and Lexicon, I
will here ſet down ſome few qualities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
peculiar to it ſelf, and which no Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
elſe (although all other concurred with
it) is able to reach unto.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Firſt, There is not a word utterable by
the mouth of man, which in this language
hath not a peculiar ſignification by it ſelf;
ſo that the allegation of <hi>Bliteri</hi> by the
Summuliſts, will be of ſmall validity.</p>
            <p n="72">72. Secondly, Such as will harken to my
inſtructions, if ſome ſtrange word be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to them, whereof there are many
thouſands of millions, deviſeable by the wit
of man, which never hitherto by any breathing
have been uttered, ſhall be able, although he
know not the ultimate ſignification thereof, to
declare what part of ſpeech it is; or if a noune,
unto what predicament or claſs it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
whether it be the ſigne of a real or
notional thing, or ſomewhat concerning me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
Trades in their Tooles, or tearmes;
or if real, whether natural or artificial, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115875:32"/>
or incompleat; for words here do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
for the things which they ſignifie; as
when we ſee my Lord Generals picture, we
ſay, there is my Lord General,</p>
            <p n="73">73. Thirdly, This world of words hath
but two hundred and fifty prime radices, upon
which all the reſt are branched: for better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
whereof, with all its dependant
boughs, ſprigs, and ramelets; I have before
my Lexicon ſet down the diviſion thereof
(making uſe of another allegory) into ſo
many Cities, which are ſubdivided into ſtreets,
they againe into lanes, thoſe into houſes, theſe
into ſtories; whereof each room ſtandeth for
a word; and all theſe ſo methodically, that
who obſerveth my precepts thereanent, ſhall
at the firſt hearing of a word, know to what
City it belongeth, and conſequently not be
ignorant of ſome general ſignification thereof,
till after a moſt exact prying into all its letters,
finding the ſtreet, lane, houſe, ſtory, and room
thereby denotated, he punctually hit upon the
very proper thing it repreſents in its moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical
ſignification.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Fourthly, By vertue of adjectitious ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicals
annexible to Nouns and Verbs, there
will ariſe of ſeveral words, what compound,
what derivative, belonging in this Language to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115875:33"/>
one Noune or to one Verb alone, a greater
number then doth pertaine to all the parts of
ſpeech, in the moſt copious Language in the
world beſides.</p>
            <p n="75">75. Fifthly, So great energy to every meaneſt
conſtitutive part of a word in this Language is
appropriated, that one word thereof, though
but of ſeven ſyllables at moſt ſhal comprehend
that which no Language elſe in the world is
able to expreſs in fewer then fourſcore and
fifteen ſeveral words; and that not only a
word here and there for maſteries ſake, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
millions of ſuch; which, to any initiated
in the rudiments of my Grammer, ſhall be
eaſie to frame.</p>
            <p n="76">76. Sixthly, In the caſes of all the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
parts of ſpeech, it ſurpaſſeth all other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
whatſoever: for whilſt others have
but five or ſix at moſt, it hath ten, beſides the
nominative.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Seventhly, There is none of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Languages, but hath ſtore of Nouns de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
of ſome caſe or other; but in this
Language there is no Heteroclite in any declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
word, nor redundancie or deficiency of
caſes.</p>
            <p n="78">78. Eighthly, Every word capable of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
is better provided therewith in this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115875:33"/>
then by any other: for in ſtead of two
or three numbers which others have, this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>afordeth
you four; to wit, the ſingular, dual,
plural, and redual.</p>
            <p n="79">79. Ninthly, It is not in this as other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
wherein ſome words lack one num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and ſome another: for here each caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
or perſonal part of ſpeech is endued with
all the numbers.</p>
            <p n="80">80. Tenthly, In this Tongue there are
eleven genders; wherein likewiſe it exceedeth
all other Languages.</p>
            <p n="81">81. Eleventhly, Verbs, Mongrels, Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and Hybrids, have all of them ten Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
beſides the preſent; which number, no
Language elſe is able to attaine to.</p>
            <p n="82">82. Twelfthly, Though there be many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugable
words in other Languages defective
of Tenſes, yet doth this Tongue allow of no
ſuch anomaly, but granteth all to each.</p>
            <p n="83">83. Thirteenthly, In lieu of ſix Moods
which other Languages have at moſt, this
one injoyeth ſeven in its conjugable words.</p>
            <p n="84">84. Fourteenthly, Verbs here, or other
conjugable parts of ſpeech, admit of no
want of Moodes, as doe other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
            <p n="85">85. Fifteenthly, in this Language, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115875:34"/>
Verbs and Participles have four voices, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was never heard that ever any other
Language had above three.</p>
            <p n="86">86. Sixteenthly, No other Tongue hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
eight or nine parts of ſpeech; but this
hath twelve.</p>
            <p n="87">87. Seventeenthly, For variety of dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in each part of ſpeech, it ſurmounteth all
the Languages in the world.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Eighteenthly, Each Noun thereof,
or Verb, may begin or end with a Vowel or
Conſonant, as to the peruſer ſhall ſeem moſt
expedient.</p>
            <p n="89">89. Nineteenthly, Every word of this
Language declinable or indeclinable hath at
leaſt ten ſeveral ſynomyma's.</p>
            <p n="90">90. Twentiethly, each of theſe ſynomyma's,
in ſome circumſtance of the ſignification, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from the reſt.</p>
            <p n="91">91. One and twentiethly, Every faculty,
ſcience, art, trade, or diſcipline, requiring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words for expreſſion of the knowledge
thereof, hath each its reſpective root from
whence all the words thereto belonging are
derived.</p>
            <p n="92">92. Two and twentiethly, In this Language
the oppoſite members of a diviſion have uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſame letters in the words which ſignifie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115875:34"/>
them; the initial and final letter being all one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with a tranſmutation only in the middle
ones.</p>
            <p n="93">93. Three and twentiethly, every word
in this Language ſignifieth as well backward
as forward; and how ever you invert the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſtill ſhall you fall upon ſignificant words:
whereby a wonderful facility is obtained in
making of Anagrams.</p>
            <p n="94">94. Four and twentiethly, there is no Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
in the world, but for every word there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it will afford you another of the ſame
ſignification, of equal ſyllables with it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
or ending, or both, with vowels or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
as it doth.</p>
            <p n="95">95. Five and twentiethly, by vertue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there is no Hexameter, Elegiack, Saphick,
Aſclepiad, Iambick, or any other kind of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
or Greek verſe, but I will afford you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in this Language of the ſame ſort, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ſyllable more or leſs in the one then the
other, <hi>Spondae</hi> anſwering to <hi>Spondae, dactil</hi>
to <hi>dactil, caeſure</hi> to <hi>caeſure,</hi> and each foot to
other, with all uniformity imaginable.</p>
            <p n="96">96. Six and twentiethly, as it trotteth eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with metrical feet, ſo at the end of the
career of each line, hath it the dexterity, after
the maner of our Engliſh and other vernacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115875:35"/>
Tongues, to ſtop with the cloſure of a rime;
in the framing whereof, the well-verſed in that
Language ſhall have ſo little labour, that for
every word therein he ſhall be able to furniſh
at leaſt five hundred ſeveral monoſyllables of
the ſame termination with it.</p>
            <p n="97">97. Seven and twentiethly, in tranſlating
verſes of any vernaculary Tongue, ſuch as
Italian, French, Spaniſh, Slavonian, Dutch,
Iriſh, Engliſh, or whatever it be, it affords
you of the ſame ſignification, ſyllable for ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
and in the cloſure of each line a ryme, as
in the original.</p>
            <p n="98">98. Eight and twentiethly, by this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and the letters thereof, we may do ſuch
admirable feats in numbers, that no cyfering
can reach its compendiouſneſs: for whereas
the ordinary way of numbring by thouſands
of thouſands of thouſands of thouſands, doth
but confuſe the hearers underſtanding; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
which, I deviſed; even by cyfering it ſelf, a
far more exact maner of numeration, as in the
Treatiſe of Arithmetick which I have ready
for the preſs, is evidently apparent; This Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
affordeth ſo conciſe words for number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the number for ſetting down, whereof
would, require in vulgar Arithmetick, more
figures in a row then there might be grains of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115875:35"/>
ſand containable from the center of the earth,
to the higheſt heavens, is in it expreſſed by
two letters.</p>
            <p n="99">99. Nine and twentiethly, what rational
Logarithms do by writing, this Language
doth by heart; and, by adding of letters, ſhall
multiply numbers; which is a moſt exquiſite
ſecret.</p>
            <p n="100">100. Thirtiethly, the digits are expreſſed
by vowels, and the conſonants ſtand for all the
reſults of the Cephaliſme, from ten to eighty
one, incluſively; whereby many pretty Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
tricks are performed.</p>
            <p n="101">101. One and thirtiethly, in the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the fixed Stars, it affordeth the moſt
ſignificant way imaginary: for by the ſingle
word alone which repreſents the Star, you
ſhall know the magnitude, together with the
longitude and latitude, both in degrees and
minutes of the Star that is expreſſed by it.</p>
            <p n="102">102. Two and thirtiethly by one word in
this Language, we ſhall underſtand what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
or what minute of the degree of a ſigne
in the Zodiake, the Sun or Moon, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
planet is in.</p>
            <p n="103">103. Three and thirtiethly, as for the
yeer of God, the moneth of that yeer, week of
the moneth, day of that week, partition of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115875:36"/>
day, hour of that partition, quarter and half
quarter of the hour, a word of one ſyllable in
this Language will expreſs it all to the full.</p>
            <p n="104">104. Four and thirtiethly, In this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
alſo, words expreſſive of herbs, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto us with what degree of cold, moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
heat, or drineſs they are qualified; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ſome other property diſtinguiſhing
them from other herbs.</p>
            <p n="105">105. Five and thirtiethly, In matter of
Colours, we ſhall learn by words in this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
the proportion of light, ſhadow, or
darkneſs commixed in them.</p>
            <p n="106">106. Six and thirtiethly, In the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſyllables by vowels and conſonants, it
affordeth the apteſt words that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for expreſſing how many vowels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants
any ſyllable is compounded of, and
how placed in priority and ſituation to one
another. Which ſecret in this Language, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
neceſſary, for underſtanding the vigour
of derivatives in their variety of ſignification.</p>
            <p n="107">107. Seven and thirtiethly, for attaining
to that dexterity which <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of
<hi>Pontus</hi> was ſaid to have, in calling all his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of an Army of threeſcore thouſand men,
by their names and ſurnames, this Language
will be ſo convenient, that if a General, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to the Rules thereof, will give new
names to his ſouldiers, whether Horſe, Foot, or

the name of a ſouldier, to know of
what Brigade, Regiment, Troop, Company,

or Baggage: Which device, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is not unuſeful for thoſe great Captains
that would endear themſelves in the favour of
the Souldiery.</p>
            <p n="108">108. Eight and thirtiethly, in the contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of nouns, pronouns, and prepoſital articles
united together, it adminiſtreth many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
varieties of Laconick expreſſions; as in the
Grammar thereof ſhall more at large be made
known unto you.</p>
            <p n="109">109. Nine and thirtiethly, every word in
this Language is ſignificative of a number;
becauſe, as words may be increaſed by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of letters and ſyllables; ſo of numbers
is there a progreſs <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="110">110. Fourtiethly, In this Language every
number, how great ſoever, may be expreſſed
by one ſingle word.</p>
            <p n="111">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:115875:37"/>
111. One and fourtiethly, As every num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
eſſentially differeth from another, ſo ſhall
the words expreſſive of ſeveral numbers, be
from one another diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p n="112">112. Two and fourtiethly. No Language
but this hath in its words the whole number of
letters, that is, ten vowels, and five and twenty
conſonants; by which means there is no word
eſcapes the latitude thereof.</p>
            <p n="113">113. Three and fourtiethly, As its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections

the manyer ſeveral ſignifications it hath:
with which propriety no other Language is

            <p n="115">115. Five and fourtiethly, All the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

to verbs as nouns: by vertue whereof,
at the firſt uttering of a verb in the active
voice, you ſhall know whether it be a god, a

116. Six and fourtiethly, In this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage

wonder in this Language, which although
a little touched by the by in the fifty eighth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle

more; and it is this, That though this language
have advantage of all other, it is impoſſible
any other in time coming ſurpaſs it, becauſe,
as I have already ſaid, it comprehendeth, firſt,
all words expreſſible; and then, in matter of
the obliquity of caſes and tenſes, the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

            <p n="127">127. Seven and fiftiethly, the greateſt
wonder of all, is, that of all the Languages in

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115875:39"/>
ſame will ſuffice to ſharpen the longing of the
generous reader, after the intrinſecal and moſt
reſearched ſecrets of the new Grammer and
Lexicon which I am to evulge.</p>
            <p>TO contrive a Language of this perfection,
will be thought by the primeſt wits of
this age, a work of a great undertaking; and
that the promover of ſo excellent an invention,
ſhould not lack for any encouragement, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the accompliſhment of a task of ſuch
maine concernment. If any ſay there are too
many Languages already, and that by their
multiplicity and confuſion, the knowledge of
things having been much retarded, this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of a new one may be well forborn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it would but intangle the minde with
more impeſtrements, where there was too
much difficulty before: I anſwer, that this
maketh not one more, but in a manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
all in it; whereby it facilitates,
and doth not obſtruct: for by making Greek,
Latin, and all the other learned Languages the
more expreſſive, it furthers the progreſs of all
Arts and Sciences, to the attaining whereof, the
uttering of our conceptions in due and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
tearms, hath, by ſome of the moſt literate
men in former ages, been eſteemed ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115875:40"/>
requiſite, that for attributing a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
thereunto, they are till this houre call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the name of <hi>Nominal Philoſophers;</hi> it
being thus very apparent to any well affected
to literature, that the performance of ſuch a
deſigne would be of a great expediency for
ſcholars: equity it ſelf ſeemeth to plead, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him by whom a benefit redounds to many,
is competent by many a proportionable retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution:
yet ſeeing nothing ought to be charged
on the publick, but upon conſiderations of
great weight; I will premiſe ſome few infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
principles, that upon them the world may
ſee, how demonſtratively are grounded the
Authors moſt reaſonable demands.</p>
            <p n="1">1. EAch good thing is deſirable, becauſe
goodneſſe is the object of the will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every thing that ought to be deſired, is
really good; becauſe a well-directed will is
not deceived with appearances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The better a thing be, the more it is to
be deſired; becauſe there is a proportion
betwixt the object and the faculty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The mind is better then the body; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by it we are the image of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The goods of the minde are better then
thoſe of the body; becauſe they give embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment
to the nobler part.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:115875:40"/>
6. The goods of either minde or body
are better then wealth; becauſe wealth is
but ſubſervient to either, and the end is more
noble then the means which are ordained
for it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Learning is the good of the minde; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it beautiefith it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This new Language is an invention full
of learning; becauſe the knowledge of all
Arts and Diſciplines is much advanced
by it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. A diſcovery is the revealment of ſome
good thing, which formerly was either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
or not at all known; for in a diſcovery
two things are requiſite; firſt, that it be good;
ſecondly, that it be revealed.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Who diſcovereth a ſecret of money,
ſhould have the fifth or third part thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is an Act of Parliament for it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If there be any diſcovery in learning,
the Act ought to extend to it; becauſe the
State is endowed with a ſoul as well as a
body.</p>
            <p n="12">12. This new-found-out invention is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of learning; becauſe the two <hi>requiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>'s
of a diſcovery, together with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of learning, are competent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115875:41"/>
13. Who diſcovereth moſt of the beſt
good, deſerveth the beſt recompenſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
merit and reward are Analogical in a
proportion of the greater reward to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
merit.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Though mony be not proportionable
to learning, yet ſeeing the learned man may
have need of money, he ſhould not lack it;
if not as a full recompence, at leaſt as a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
or largeſs, ſhould it be given unto him,
in teſtimony of his worth, and the reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
toward him, &amp; withal to encourage him
the more to eminent undertakings: for were it
otherwiſe, the more deſerving a man were, the
worſe he would be uſed; there being nothing
ſo unreaſonable, as to refuſe a little to any that
ſtands in need thereof, becauſe a great deal
more is due unto him: as if in time of famine,
there being no more but one peny-loaf to give
unto a Prince, he ſhould be made ſtarve for
the want of it, becauſe of his deſerving better
fare: For, <hi>that which comprehends the more,
comprehendeth the leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. In matter of recompence for good
things proceeding from the minde, which in
in the midſt of flames cannot be conquered,
and by vertue whereof a gallant man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115875:41"/>
free, and invincible in his better part, we
ought altogether to preſcind and abſtract
from the conditions of the native country, and
perſon of the deſerver, whether that be fertil,
or barren; or this, at liberty or indurance; for
theſe being things <hi>quae non fecimus ipſi,</hi> we
ought to ſay, <hi>Vix ea noſtra voco:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeeing puniſhment and reward ſhould
attend the performance of nothing elſe, but
what did lye in our power to do, or not to
do; and that the ſpecifying of good or bad
actions, dependeth upon the qualification of
the intention; no man ſhould be either pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed,
or rewarded, for being either a <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
man, or a priſoner, or both, if no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
concur therewith; becauſe the country of
our birth, and ſtate of our perſon, as being
oftentimes the effects of a good or bad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
are not alwayes in our power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p n="16">16. If by means of the aforeſaid diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
may be effectuated the ſaving of great
charges to the ſubjects of the land, a pecunial
or praedial recompenſe will (in ſo far) be very
anſwerable to the nature of that ſervice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in matter of merit, and the reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
thereunto, money is with money,
and things vendible, no leſs homogeneal, then
honor with vertue.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115875:42"/>
17. The State no doubt will deal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
with their priſoners of war, without
<hi>proſopolepſie,</hi> or any reſpect to one more then
another; and that by a geometrical equity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is juſt.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The State aſſuredly will grant the
ſame freedom to one priſoner <hi>(caeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus)</hi>
which they do to another, and upon the
ſame terms, thoſe of a like condition not being
unequally faulty; becauſe they will not be

            <p n="19">19. If any one priſoner of a like condition
and quality, at the leaſt <hi>(in caeteris)</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
that hath obtained his liberty, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the publick ſomewhat conducible
thereunto, which the other is not verſed in,
common equity requireth, that he have a
compenſation ſutable to that additional en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment;
for, <hi>ſi ab inaequalibus aequalia

Act for diſcoveries maintaines the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Though it be commonly maintained
amongſt the Proteſtants, that we cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogate
towards Almighty God, (albeit
thoſe of the Romiſh faith be of another opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
for that God cannot be unjuſt, how ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſoever he inflict his afflictions; and that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115875:42"/>
all the favors he conferreth on mankind are
of his meer grace, not our deſerving: yet that
a ſubject may be capable of ſupererogation
towards any ſublunary State or ſoveraignty, is
not only agreeable with all the religions of the
world; but alſo a maine principle of humane
ſociety, and ground unalterable of politick
Government; for who tranſgreſſe not the
limits of thoſe good ſubjects, whoſe actions,
thoughts, and words, ſhew at all times faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
loyalty, and obedience to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power under which they live, are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
eſteemed (by ſo doing, to diſcharge
their duty ſo to the full, that in reaſon no
more can be required of them. If therefore
it happen, beſides this general bond of fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whereunto all the natives and inhabitants
of a country are by their birth and protection
inviolably ingaged, that any one more oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then others, performe ſome ſingular good
office, unto which he was not formerly
tyed by the ſtrictneſs of his allegiance, there
is no doubt, but that the publick (whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
exempteth not from thankfulneſs, more
then private perſons) ſhould and will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
ſuch an action, exceeding the reach
of his fellow-patriots and co-habitants, to be
meritorious, and therefore worthy of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115875:43"/>
upon which conſideration, according
to the peoples diverſity of carriage, in the well
or ill demeaning of themſelves, are built the
two maine pillars of reward and puniſhment,
without which the ſtrongeſt Commonwealth
on earth on earth is not able to ſubſiſt long
from falling to peices. That it is ſo, I appeal
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who (with the approbation of all
that lived ſince his dayes) exclaimed againſt
<hi>Rome,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>O ingratam patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am!</hi>
as likewiſe to thoſe many great Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Philoſophers, who from age to age
twitted the <hi>Athenians</hi> with ingratitude for
the oſtracizing of <hi>Ariſtides;</hi> for if humane
frailties were not incident to Princes, States,
and Incorporations, as well as unto individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
in their ſingle and private callings, and
particular deportments; there would never
be any need of proteſtations, declarations, or
defenſive war againſt the Tyranny, uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and oppreſſions of miſrule. Hence do I
think that in a well polliſhed State, reward
will not be wanting to him that merits it for
his good ſervice; becauſe puniſhment, by the
Law, attends the offender; and <hi>contrario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
eadem eſt ratio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. It is acknowledged by the laws and
cuſtoms of this Iſland, that the ſubjects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115875:43"/>
have a right of propriety to their goods,
notwithſtanding the titles of dominion and
ſupremacy remaining in the perſons of others
above them; and that if for erecting a Caſtle,
Fort, Church, Hoſpital, Colledge, Hall, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine,
or any other kind of edifice tending to
publike uſe, the State ſhould be pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon the land of any private perſon,
who doubteth but that ſuch a man (of how
mean ſoever a condition he be) will in juſtice
be heard to give up, and require the full value
of his land, that a compenſation ſuitable to
the worth thereof, may be allowed to him?
founding the equity of ſo juſt a retribution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Ahabs</hi> caſe in <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard. Now
the ſoul and body of man being more a mans
own (they being the conſtitutive parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Phyſically he is compoſed) then are the
goods of fortune, which totally are accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to him, it follows clearly that a man hath
a full right of propriety to the goods of his
own mind, and conſequently ſuch goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better (as hath been evidenced by the ſixth
Axiome) then any external means, what can
be more manifeſt, than that he who is endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>a minore ad majus,</hi> and therefore <hi>a

            </p>
            <p n="22">22. If ſuch a one nevertheleſs voluntarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſpecious Axiomes, Definitions, and
uncontroulable Maximes thus premiſed, I
muſt make bold, in behalf of the Author, to
deduce from thence the equity of his deſires,
in demanding that the ſame Inheritance, which
for theſe ſeveral hundreds of yeers, through a
great many Progenitors, hath by his anceſtors,
without the interruption of any other, been
poſſeſt, be now fully devolved on him, with
the ſame Priviledges and Immunities, in all
things, as they enjoyed it. But, the better to
make appear his ingenuity in this his ſuit, and
modeſtie in requiring no more, it is expedient
to declare what it is he offereth unto the State,
for obliging them to vouchſafe him the grant
of no leſs. May the Reader therefore be pleaſed
to underſtand, that it is the diſcovery of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
in Learning, which, beſides the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115875:44"/>
it cannot chuſe but yeeld to ingenious
ſpirits, will afford a huge benefit to Students
of all ſorts, by the abridgement of their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
in making them learn more in three yeers,
with the help thereof, then, without it, in the
ſpace of five. This ſaving of two yeers charges
to Scholars in ſuch a vaſt Dominion as this is,
although I ſpeak nothing of the ſparing of ſo
much time, (which, to a methodical wit of any
pregnancie, is a menage of an ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue)
cannot be appreciated, how parſimonious
ſoever they be in their diet and apparel,) at leſs
then ten thouſand pounds Engliſh a yeer.</p>
            <p>That this is a ſecret, it is clear by this, That
never any, ſince the laying of the foundations
of the earth, did ſo much as divulge a ſyllable
thereof; which undoubtedly they would have
done, had they had any knowledge therein.
And that none now living (be it ſpoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſparagement of any) either knoweth
it, or knoweth how to go about it, ſave the
aforeſaid Author alone, who is willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
all he demands (although by birth-right
it be his own already, and worth neer upon a
thouſands pounds <hi>ſterlin</hi> a yeer) if, without
his help, any breathing (notwithſtanding the
inſtructions may poſſibly be had by his loſt
Papers, and by what in the preceding Articles
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115875:45"/>
hath been in this little Tractate promulgated)
ſhall, within half a yeer after the date hereof,
give any apparent teſtimony to the world,
that he hath any inſight in this invention.</p>
            <p>Which, that it is good and deſirable, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
by the firſt and ſecond Axiomes: and
that it is a Diſcovery, and a diſcovery of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
by the ninth and twelfth: that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of a matter of leſs moment then it,
deſerveth great ſums of money, is manifeſt by
the tenth and thirteenth: and that a retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great value ſhould attend the diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of ſo prime a ſecret, by the eleventh and
fourteenth: that the knowledge of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
is of more worth then either Strength
or Wealth, is proved by the fifth and ſixth:
and that it is more to be deſired then any
thing that is at the diſpoſure of Fortune, by
the third and fourth: that it doth promove
Reaſon, illuminate the Judgement, further
and improve Literature, by poliſhing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhing
the inward abilities of man, and

And although his being a <hi>Scot,</hi>
and a priſoner of War, may perhaps (in the
opinion of ſome) eclipſe the ſplendor of ſo
great an expectation; yet that it ſhould not,
is moſt perſpicuouſly evinced by the fifteenth
Axiome.</p>
            <p>That he is a <hi>Scot,</hi> he denieth not; but that
he thereby meriteth to be either praiſed or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed,
is utterly to be diſavowed, becauſe it
lay not in his power to appoint localities for
his mothers reſidence at the time of his nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or to enact any thing before he had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf.</p>
            <p>True it is, that nothing is more uſual in
ſpeech, then to blame all, for the fault of the
greater part; and to twit a whole Country
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115875:46"/>
with that vice, to which moſt of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are inclined. Hence have we theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
<hi>The Spaniards are proud, The French
inconſtant, The Italians lecherous, The
Cretians lyers, The Sicilians falſe, The
Aſiaticks effeminate, The Crovats cruel,
The Dutch temuleucious, The Polonians
quarrelſome, The Saxons mutinous;</hi> and
ſo forth thorow other Territories, nurſeries of
enormities of another kinde: although no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be more certain, then that there are ſome
Spaniards as humble, French as conſtant, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
chaſte, Cretians true, Sicilians ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Aſiaticks warlike, Crovates merciful,
Dutch ſober, Polonians peaceable, and ſome
Saxons as loyal, as any in the world beſides.
By which account, all forreigners (for ſuch
are all the inhabitants on the earth, in relation
to thoſe that are not their compatriots) yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>moſt</hi> and <hi>ſome</hi> of each ſtranger-Land,
in its reſpective vice and vertue; it may
ſafely be avouched, that there is under the ſun
no National fault, nor National deſerving,
whereby all merit to be puniſhed, or all reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
becauſe the badneſs of moſt in each, deſtroys
the univerſality of vertue; and the good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of ſome in all, cuts off the generality of
vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:115875:46"/>
But to come neerer home: ſeeing <hi>Scotland</hi>
was never loaded with ſo much diſreputation,
for Covetouſneſs and Hypocriſie, as it is at
this preſent; and that the Knight for whom
this Treatiſe is intended, hath, as a Patriot,
ſome intereſt in the good name thereof; it is
not amiſs, that, for the love of him and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<hi>Scots,</hi> I glance a little at the occaſion (if
not the cauſe) of ſo heavie an imputation;
eſpecially that Country having been aſperſed
therewith, long before it had ſuſtained the loſs
of any Battel, wherein the ſeveral miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
looked rather like the effect of what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had procured the ſaid reproach, then
any way as the cauſes thereof: for where
Covetouſneſs is predominant, Fidelity, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and Vigilancie, muſt needs diſcamp,
if <hi>Mammona</hi> give the word: the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie
of Vices (ſeeing <hi>contrariorum eadem
eſt ratio)</hi> being a ſequele from that infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
tenet in the Morals, the concatenation of
vertues.</p>
            <p>How this Covetouſneſs, under the mask of
Religion, took ſuch deep root in that Land,
was one way occaſioned by ſome Miniſters,
who, to augment their ſtipends, and cram their
bags full of money, thought fit to poſſeſs the
mindes of the people with a ſtrong opinion of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115875:47"/>
their ſanctity, and implicite obedience to their
Injunctions: to which effect, moſt rigidly Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitizing
it in their <hi>Synagogical Sanhedrius,</hi>
and officiouſly bragging in their Pulpits (even
when <hi>Scotland,</hi> by divers notorious calamities
of both Sword, Plague, and Famine, was
brought very lowe) that no Nation (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likeſt to the <hi>Jews</hi> of any other) was ſo
glorious as it; they, with a Phariſaical ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilioſity,
would always rebuke the non-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters
and Sectaries as Publicans and ſinners,
unfit for the purity of their converſation, unleſs,
by the malignancie or over-maſtering power of
a croſs winde, they ſhould be forced to cale the
hypocritical bunt, let fall the top-gallant of
their counterfeit devotion, and tackling about,
to ſail a quite contrary courſe, (as many of
them have already done) the better at laſt to
caſt anchor in the harbour of Profit, which
is the Butt they aimed at, and ſole period of
all their diſſimulations.</p>
            <p>For I have known ſome, even of the moſt
rigid zealots, who, rather then to forgo their
preſent emoluments, by continual receiving, and
never erogating; by never ſowing, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
reaping; and by making the ſterility of
all men prove fruitful to them, and their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
barren to all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Would wiſh <hi>Presbytery</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:115875:47"/>
were of as empty a ſound, as its homaeoteleft,
<hi>Blitery;</hi> and the Covenant, which aſſerts it no
leſs exploded from all Eccleſiaſtical Societies,
then <hi>Plautus</hi> exolet phraſes have been from
the eloquent orations of <hi>Ciceron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this affecting only a part of the Tribe
of <hi>Levi,</hi> how the remainder of new <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
(as the <hi>kirkomanetick Philarchaiſts</hi>
would have it called) comes to be upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſame opprobry of covetouſneſs,
is that which I am ſo heartily ſorry for, that
to wipe of its obloquy, I would undertake a
pilgrimage to old <hi>Judea,</hi> viſit the ruines of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
and trace the foot-ſteps of <hi>Zode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs</hi>
fellow-captives to the gates of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet did this ſo great an inconvenience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
meerly from an incogitancy, in not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heed to what is preſcribed by Prudence the
directreſs of all vertues,) and conſequently of
that which moderates the actions of giving
and receiving; (although it be <hi>nobilius dare
quam accipere;</hi> the non-vitioſity whereof, by
her injunctions, dependeth on the judicious
obſerving of all the circumſtances mentioned
in this Mnemoneutick Hexameter <hi>Quis, quid,

whoſe laſt particle, by the untimely taking of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115875:48"/>
a juſt debt, and unſeaſonable receiving of
what at another time might have been lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
required, being too careleſly regarded by
the State and Milice of that country, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to this contumely; the ſtaine whereof
remaineth ſtill, notwithſtanding the loſs in
money (beſides other prejudices) ſuſtained
ſince, of ten times more then they got.</p>
            <p>I heard once a <hi>Maronite Jew</hi> to vindicate
the reputation of the family and village of the
<hi>Iſcariots,</hi> in which he pretended to have ſome
intereſt, very ſeriouſly relate, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the opinion of <hi>Rabbi Ezra,</hi> the thirty
peeces of ſilver delivered to <hi>Judas,</hi> was but
the ſame ſum which, long before that, when
<hi>Chriſt</hi> went up from <hi>Galilee</hi> to celebrate the
feaſt of tabernacles at <hi>Jeruſalem, Malchus</hi>
the ſervant of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had borrowed from
him (whilſt he had the charge of his Maſters
bag) with aſſurance punctually to repay it him
again, at the ſubſequent term of the paſſover, as
the faſhion was then amongſt the inhabitants
of <hi>Judea:</hi> but although it were ſo (which we
are not bound to give ear to, becauſe it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet down in the fifth verſe of the two and
twentieth Chapter of the Evangile according
to Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> that the high prieſts made a
Covenant with <hi>Judas)</hi> yet ſhould he not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115875:48"/>
have received the mony in the very nick of the
time that his maſter was to be apprehended.</p>
            <p>This I the rather believe, for that I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
heard a Miniſter ſay, that he offends
God who ſtretcheth forth his hand to take in
the payment of any debt (how juſt ſoever it
be) upon a Sunday; and that though a purſe
full of gold were offered unto himſelf, whilſt
he is a preaching in the Pulpit, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
it.</p>
            <p>Theſe collateral inſtances I introduce, not
for application, but illuſtration ſake; not for
compariſon, but explication of the congruent
adapting of neceſſary puntilio's for the fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a vertuous action.</p>
            <p>Another thing there is that fixeth a
grievous ſcandal upon that Nation, in matter
of philargyrie, or love of money; and it is
this: There hath been in <hi>London,</hi> and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, for theſe many yeers together, a
knot of <hi>Scotiſh</hi> bankers, collybiſts, or coine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſers,
of traſfickers in Merchandiſe to and
againe, and of men of other profeſſions, who
by hook and crook, <hi>fas &amp; nefas,</hi> ſlight and
might (all being as fiſh their net could catch)
having feathered their neſts to ſome purpoſe,
look ſo idolatrouſly upon their <hi>Dagon</hi> of
wealth, and ſo cloſely (like the earths dull
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115875:49"/>
center) hug all unto themſelves; that, for no
reſpect of vertue, honor, kinred, patriotiſm, or
whatever elſe (be it never ſo recommendable,
will they depart from ſo much as one ſingle
peny, whoſe emiſſion doth not, without any

beyond all conſcience an additionall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
to the heap of that ſtock which they
ſo much adore: which churliſh and tenacious
humor, hath made many, that were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

all their compatriots infected with the
ſame leproſie of a wretched peeviſhneſs; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
thoſe <hi>quomodocunquizing</hi> cluſterfiſts and
rapacious varlets have given of late ſuch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal-like
proofs, by their inhumanity and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate
carriage towards ſome (whoſe ſhoos-ſtrings
they are not worthy to unty) that were
it not that a more able pen then mine, will
aſſuredly not faile to jerk them on all ſides, in

they endeavor not to wipe off the blot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

they might in all times coming, be debarred
the benefit of any honeſt converſation.</p>
            <p>Thus is it perceptible how uſual it is, from
the irregularity of a few, to conclude an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
defection; and that the whole is faulty,
becauſe a part is not right; there being in it
a fallacy of induction, as if becauſe this, that
and the other are both greedy and diſſembling,
that therefore all other their country-men are
ſuch: which will no wayes follow, if any
one of theſe others be free from thoſe vices;
for that one particular negative (by the rules
of contradictory oppoſites) will deſtroy an
univerſal affirmative; and of ſuch there are
many thouſands in that Nation, who are
neither greedy nor diſſemblers.</p>
            <p>And ſo would all the reſt, if a joint and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
courſe were taken to have their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
free from baſeneſs, their Church-men
from avarice, their Merchants from deceit,

from prevarication, their Tradeſmen from

young men from pride, their old men from

the Magiſtrates from injuſtice, the
Clients from litigiouſneſs, and all of them from
diſhoneſty, and diſreſpect of learning; which,
though but negatives of vertue, and (at beſt)
but the <hi>ultimum non eſſe</hi> of vice, would
nevertheleſs go near to reſtore the good fame
of that country to its priſtine integrity; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
whereof was raiſed to ſo high a pitch of

ſhort time began to be ſo redoubtable, that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115875:54"/>
at laſt he became a terrour to all the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
Duelliſts and Bravo's of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
a queller of the fury of the proudeſt Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
of his Age: for, all the innumerable
Combats which he fought againſt both
Turks and Chriſtians, hoth on horſe and
foot, cloſed always with the death or ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the adverſary (of what degree or
condition ſoever he might be) that was ſo
bold as to cope with and encounter him in that
kinde of Hoſtility: the Gaſconads of <hi>France,</hi>
Rodomontads of <hi>Spain,</hi> Fanfaronads of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and Bragadochio brags of all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
could no more aſtoniſh his invincible
heart, then would the cheeping of a Mouſe a
Bear robbed of her whelps. That warlike
and ſtrong Mahometan, who dared (like
another <hi>Goliah)</hi> and appealled the ſtouteſt
and moſt valiant of the Chriſtian faith, to
enter the Liſts with him, and fight in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Religion, was (after many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of galliant Chriſtians had been foyled
by him) thrown dead to the ground by the
vigour and dexterity of his hand. He would
very often, (in the preſence of Ladies, whoſe
intimate favourite he was) to give ſome proof
of the undantedneſs of his courage, by the
meer activity of his body, with the help of a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115875:55"/>
ſingle ſword, ſet upon a Lyon in his greateſt
fierceneſs, and kil'd him dead upon the place.
For running, vaulting, jumping, throwing of
the barr, and other ſuch-like feats of nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſtrength, and agility, he was the only
paragon of the world, and unmatched by
any.</p>
            <p>Whilſt, in <hi>Madrid, Genua, Milan, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
Florence, Naples, Paris, Bruxelles,
Vienna,</hi> and other great and magnificent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for the defence of the honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Ladies whom he affected, he had in
ſuch meaſure incurred the hatred and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome great and potent Princes, that, to
affront him, they had ſent numbers of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſins,
and Acuchilladores, to ſurpriſe him at
their beſt advantage; he would often times,
all alone, buckle with ten or twelve of them,
and lay ſuch load, and ſo thick and threeſold
upon them, that he would quickly make them
for their ſafeties betake themſelves to their
heels, with a vengeance at their back; by
which meanes he gave ſuch evidence of his
greatneſs of reſolution, ſtrenuitie of perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
in conduct, and incomparable magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſpirt, that being comfortable to his
friends, formidable to his foes, and admirable
to all; ſuch as formerly had been his cruelleſt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115875:55"/>
enemies, and moſt deeply had plotted and
projected his ruine, were at laſt content, out of
a remorſe of conſcience, to acknowledge the
aſcendent of his worth above theirs, and to
ſue, in all humility, to be reconciled to him.
To this demand of theirs (out of his wonted
generoſity, which was never wanting, when
either goodneſs or mercie required the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſe thereof) having fully condeſcended, he
paſt the whole remainder of his days in great
ſecurity, and with all eaſe deſirable, in the City
of <hi>Naples;</hi> where, in a vigorous old age, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
with his friends and enjoying the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

full peace and quietneſs: and there I leave him
For, ſhould I undertake condignly to ſet

another Scotiſh Colonel that ſerved this King

end, and yet I cannot hit upon it: he was not
a Souldier bred, yet, for many yeers together,
bore charge in <hi>Flanders</hi> under the command
of <hi>Spinola.</hi> In his youth-hood, he was ſo
ſtrong and ſtiff a Presbyterian, that he was
the onely man in <hi>Scotland</hi> made choice of, and
relied upon for the eſtabliſhment and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Government, as the arch-prop and
main pillar thereof: but as his judgement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
and that he ripened in knowledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
from that Neoterick faith; and waining
in his love to Presbytery, as he waxed in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of the world, of a ſtrict Puritan that he
was at firſt, he became afterwards the moſt
obſtinate and rigid Papiſt, that ever was upon
the earth. It is ſtrange my memory ſhould
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115875:56"/>
ſo faile me, that I cannot remember his title:
he was a Lord I know, nay more, he was an
Earle, I that he was, and one of the firſt of
them: Ho now! peſcods on it, <hi>Crauford Lodi
Lindſay</hi> puts me in minde of him; it was the
old Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> this Marquis of <hi>Argile's</hi>
father: that was he, that was the man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as Steel is beſt reſiſted and overcome
by Steel; and that the <hi>Scots</hi> (like <hi>Iſmael,</hi>
whoſe hand was againſt every man, and every
mans hand againſt him) have been of late ſo
ingaged in all the wars of Chriſtendome, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſing,
in a manner, the intereſt of all the
Princes thereof; that, what battel ſoever, at
any time theſe forty yeers paſt hath been
ſtruck within the continent of <hi>Europe,</hi> all the
<hi>Scots</hi> that fought in that field, were never ſo
overthrown, and totally routed; for if ſome
of them were captives and taken priſoners, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of that Nation were victorious, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of quarter; valour and mercy on the
one ſide, with misfortune and ſubjection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the otherſide, meeting one another in the

gold and treaſure of the <hi>India's,</hi> not being
able to purchaſe all the affections of <hi>Scotland</hi>
to the furtherance of <hi>Caſtilian</hi> deſignes, there
have been of late ſeveral <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Colonels

under the command of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
in oppoſition of the <hi>Spagniard;</hi> viz. Colonel

who took a Spaniſh General in the field upon

Colonel <hi>Scot</hi> Earl of <hi>Bacliugh,</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
Sir <hi>Iames Liviſtoun,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
and lately in theſe our tourmoyles at
home Lieutenant-General of both Horſe and
Foot, beſides a great many other worthy
Colonels, amongſt which I will only comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
one, named Colonel <hi>Dowglas,</hi> who
to the States of <hi>Holland</hi> was often times ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
in diſcharging the office and duty of
General Engineer; whereof they are now ſo
ſenſible, that, to have him alive againe, and
of that vigour freſhneſs in both body and
ſpirit, wherewith he was endowed in the day
he was killed on, they would give thrice his
weight in gold; and well they might: for ſome
few weeks before the fight wherein he was
ſlaine, he preſented to them twelve Articles
and heads of ſuch wonderful feats for the uſe
of the wars both by Sea and Land, to be
performed by him, flowing from rhe remoteſt
ſprings of Mathematical ſecrets, and thoſe of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115875:57"/>
natural Philoſophy, that none of this age
ſaw, nor any of our fore-fathers ever heard
the like, ſave what out of <hi>Cicero, Livy, Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
and other old Greek and Latin writers
we have couched, of the admirable inventions
made uſe of by <hi>Archimedes</hi> in defence of the
City of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> againſt the continual aſſaults
of the <hi>Romane</hi> Forces both by Sea and Land,
under the conduct of <hi>Marcellus.</hi> To ſpeak
really, I think there hath not been any in this
age of the Scotiſh Nation, ſave <hi>Neper,</hi> and
<hi>Crichtoun,</hi> who, for abilities of the minde
in matter of practical inventions uſeful for men
of induſtry, merit to be compared with him:
and yet of theſe two (notwithſtanding their
precellency in learning) I would be altogether
ſilent (becauſe I made account to mention no
other Scotiſh men here, but ſuch as have
been famous for ſouldiery, and brought up
at the ſchoole of <hi>Mars)</hi> were it not, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
their profoundneſs in literature, they
were inriched with Military qualifications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

deſigned Lord <hi>Marchiſton)</hi> he is for his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garithmical
device ſo compleatly praiſed in
that Preface of the <hi>Authors,</hi> which uſhers
a trigonometrical book of his, intituled the
<hi>Triſſotetras,</hi> that to add any more thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115875:58"/>
would but obſcure with an empty ſound,
the clearneſs of what is already ſaid: therefore
I will allow him no ſhare in this diſcourſe, but
in ſo ſar as concerneth an almoſt incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible
device, which being in the mouths of
the moſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and yet unknown to
any that ever was in the world but himſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
very well to be taken notice of in this
place; and it is this: he had the skill (as is
commonly reported) to frame an Engine (for
invention not much unlike that of <hi>Architas</hi>
Dove) which, by vertue of ſome ſecret ſprings,
inward reſorts, with other implements and
materials fit for the purpoſe, incloſed within
the bowels thereof, had the power (if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
in bulk to the action required of
it (for he could have made it of all ſizes) to
clear a field of four miles circumference, of
all the living creatures exceeding a foot of
hight, that ſhould be found thereon, how neer
ſoever they might be to one another; by
which means he made it appear, that he was
able, with the help of this machine alone, to
kill thirty thouſand <hi>Turkes,</hi> without the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of one <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Of this it is ſaid,
that (upon a wager) he gave proof upon a
large plaine in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the deſtruction of
a great many herds of cattel, and flocks of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115875:58"/>
ſheep, whereof ſome were diſtant from other
half a mile on all ſides, and ſome a whole mile.
To continue the thred of the ſtory, as I
have it, I muſt not forget, that, when he
was moſt earneſtly deſired by an old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and profeſſed friend of his, even about
the time of his contracting that diſeaſe
whereof he dyed, he would be pleaſed, for the
hunour of his family, and his own everlaſting
memory to poſterity, to reveal unto him the
manner of the contrivance of ſo ingenious a
myſtery; ſubjoining thereto, for the better
perſwading of him, that it were a thouſand
pities, that ſo excellent an invention ſhould be
buryed with him in the grave, and that after
his deceaſe nothing ſhould be known thereof;
His anſwer was, That for the ruine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of man, there were too many devices
already framed, which if he could make to
be fewer, he would with all his might endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to do; and that therefore ſeeing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and rancor rooted in the heart of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
will not ſuffer them to diminiſh, by any
new conceit of his, the number of them
ſhould never be increaſed. Divinely ſpoken,
truly.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak a little now of his compatriot
<hi>Crichtoun,</hi> I hope will not offend the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115875:59"/>
Reader; who may know, by what is
already diſplayed, that it cannot be heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
from the propoſed purpoſe, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of that magnanimous act atchieved by
him at the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Court, to the
honour not only of his own, but to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
renown alſo of the whole Iſle of <hi>Britain;</hi>
the manner whereof was thus.</p>
            <p>A certaine <hi>Italian</hi> gentleman, of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
able, ſtrong, nimble, and vigorous body,
by nature fierce, cruell, warlike, and audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and in the gladiatory art ſo ſuperlatively
expert and dextrous, that all the moſt skilful
teachers of Eſcrime, and Fencing-maſters of
<hi>Italy</hi> (which, in matter of choice profeſſors in
that faculty needed never as yet to yeild to
any Nation in the world) were by him beaten
to their good behaviour, and, by blows and
thruſts given in, which they could not avoid,
enforced to acknowledge him their over com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
bethinking himſelf, how, after ſo great
a conqueſt of reputation, he might by ſuch
means be very ſuddenly enriched, he projected
a courſe of exchanging the blunt to ſharp, and
the foiles into tucks; and in his reſolution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
a purſe full of gold, worth neer upon
four hundred pounds Engliſh money, traveled
alongſt the moſt eſpecial and conſidetable
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115875:59"/>
parts of <hi>Spaine, France,</hi> the Low-countryes,
<hi>Germany, Pole, Hungary, Greece, Italy,</hi>
and other places where ever there was greateſt
probability of encountring with the eagereſt &amp;
moſt atrocious duelliſts; and immediately after
his arrival to any City or Town that gave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
likelihood of ſome one or other cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
that would enter the liſts and cope
with him, he boldly challenged them with
ſound of Trumpet, in the chief market-place,
to adventure an equal ſum of money againſt
that of his, to be diſputed at the ſwords point,
who ſhould have both. There failed not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
brave men, almoſt of all Nations, who
accepting of his cartels, were not afraid to
hazard both their perſon and coine againſt
him: but (till he midled with this <hi>Crichtoun)</hi>
ſo maine was the Aſcendent he had above all
his Antagoniſts, and ſo unlucky the fate of
ſuch as offered to ſcuffle with him, that all his
oppoſing combatants (of what State or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
ſoever they were) who had not loſt
both their life and gold, were glad, for the
preſervation of their perſon (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a great expence of blood) to leave
both their reputation &amp; mony behind them. At
laſt returning homewards to his own country,
loaded with honor and wealth, or rather the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115875:60"/>
ſpoile of the reputation of thoſe forraginers,
whom the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Tramontani,</hi> he, by
the way, after his accuſtomed manner of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bording
other places, repaired to the City of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> where the Duke (according to the
courteſie uſually beſtowed on him by other
Princes, vouchſafed him a protection, and
ſavegard for his perſon: he (as formerly he was
wont to do by beat of Drum, ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
and ſeveral printed papers, diſcloſing his
deſigne, battered on all the chief gates, poſts,
and pillars of the Town) gave all men to
underſtand, that his purpoſe was, to challenge
at the ſingle Rapier, any whoſoever of that
City or country, that durſt be ſo bold as to
fight with him, provided he would depoſite a
a bag of five hundred Spaniſh Piſtols, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt
another of the ſame value, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſhould lay down, upon this condition, that
the enjoyment of both ſhould be the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
due. His challenge was not long unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:
for it happened at the ſame time, that
three of the moſt notable cutters in the world,
(and ſo highly cryed up for valour, that all the
Bravo's of the Land were content to give way
to their domineering (how inſolent ſoever they
ſhould prove) becauſe of their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly-obtained
victories in the field) were all
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115875:60"/>
three together at the court of <hi>Mantua;</hi> who
hearing of ſuch a harveſt of five hundred
Piſtols, to be reaped (as they expected) very
ſoon, and with eaſe, had almoſt conteſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
themſelves for the priority of the firſt
encounterer, but that one of my Lord Dukes
Courtiers moved them to caſt lots for who
ſhould be firſt, ſecond, and third, in caſe
none of the former two ſhould prove victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Without more adoe, he whoſe chance
it was to anſwer the cattel with the firſt defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
preſented himſelf within the barriers, or
place appointed for the fight, where his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
attending him, as ſoon as the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
ſounded a charge, they jointly fel to work:
and (becauſe I am not now to amplifie the
particulars of a combat) although the diſpute
was very hot for a while, yet, whoſe fortune it
was to he the firſt of the three in the field, had
the diſaſter to be the firſt of the three that was
foyled: for at laſt with a thruſt in the throat
he was killed dead upon the ground. This
nevertheleſs not a whit diſmayed the other
two; for the nixt day he that was ſecond in
the roll, gave his appearance after the ſame
manner as the firſt had done, but with no
better ſucceſs; for he likewiſe was laid flat
dead upon the place, by means of a thruſt he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115875:61"/>
received in the heart. The laſt of the three
finding that he was as ſure of being engaged
in the fight, as if he had been the firſt in order,
pluckt up his heart, knit his ſpirits together,
and, on the day after the death of the ſecond,
moſt couragiouſly entering the Liſts, demeaned
himſelf for a while with great activity and
skill; but at laſt, his luck being the ſame with
thoſe that preceded him, by a thruſt in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he within four and twenty hours after
gave up the ghoſt. Theſe (you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine)
were lamentable ſpectacles to the Duke
and Citie of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who caſting down
their faces for ſhame, knew not what courſe
to take for reparation of their honour. The
conquering Duelliſt, proud of a victory ſo
highly tending to both his honour and profit,
for the ſpace of a whole fortnight, or two
weeks together, marched daily along the
ſtreets of <hi>Mantua,</hi> (without any oppoſition
or controulment) like another <hi>Romulus,</hi> or
<hi>Marcellus</hi> in triumph: which the never-too-much-to-be-admired
<hi>Crichtoun</hi> perceiving, to
wipe off the imputation of cowardiſe lying
upon the Court of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to which he had
but even then arrived, (although formerly he
had been a domeſtick thereof) he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eat nor drink till he had firſt ſent a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115875:61"/>
to the conqueror, appelling him to repair
with his beſt ſword in his hand, by nine of the
clock in the morning of the next day, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the whole Court, and in the ſame
place where he had killed the other three, to
fight with him upon this quarrel, that, in
the Court of <hi>Mantua</hi> there were as valiant
men as he; and, for his better encouragement
to the deſired undertaking, he aſſured him,
that, to the aforeſaid five hundred piſtols, he
would adjoyn a thouſand more; wiſhing him
to do the like, that the Victor, upon the point
of his ſword, might carry away the richer
booty. The Challenge, with all its conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is no ſooner accepted of, the time and
place mutually condeſcended upon kept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
and the fifteen hundred piſtols <hi>hinc
inde</hi> depoſited, but of the two Rapiers of
equal weight, length, and goodneſs, each
taking one, in preſence of the Duke, Dutcheſs,
with all the Noble-men, Ladies, Magnifico's,
and all the choiceſt of both men, women, and
maids of that citie, as ſoon as the ſignal for
the Duel was given, by the ſhot of a great
Piece of Ordnance of threeſcore and four
pound ball; the two combatants, with a lion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
animoſity, made their approach to one
another; and being within diſtance, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115875:62"/>
               <hi>Crichtoun,</hi> to make his adverſary ſpend
his fury the ſooner, betook himſelf to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
part; wherein, for a long time, he
ſhewed ſuch excellent dexterity, in warding
the others blows, ſlighting his falſifyings, in
breaking meaſure, and often, by the agility of
his hody, avoiding his thruſts, that he ſeemed
but to play, whilſt the other was in earneſt.
The ſweetneſs of <hi>Crichtoun</hi>'s countenance, in
the hoteſt of the aſſault, like a glance of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on the hearts of the ſpectators, brought
all the Italian Ladies on a ſudden to be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
of him; whilſt the ſternneſs of the
other's aſpect, he looking like an enraged
Bear, would have ſtruck terrour into Wolves,
and affrighted an Engliſh Maſtiff. Though
they were both in their linens, (to wit, ſhirts
and drawers, without any other apparel) and
in all outward conveniencies equally adjuſted;
the Italian, with redoubling his ſtroaks, foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the mouth with a cholerick heart, and
fetched a pantling breath: the Scot, in ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his charge, kept himſelf in a pleaſant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
without paſſion, and made void his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes:
he alters his wards from Tierce to
Quart; he primes and ſeconds it, now high,
now lowe, and caſts his body (like another
<hi>Prothee)</hi> into all the ſhapes he can, to ſpie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115875:62"/>
an open on his adverſary, and lay hold of an
ndvantage; but all in vain: for the invincible
<hi>Crichtoun,</hi> whom no cunning was able to
ſurpriſe, contrepoſtures his reſpective wards,
and, with an incredible nimbleneſs of both
hand and foot, evades his intent, and fruſtrates
the invaſion. Now is it, that the never-before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered
Italian, finding himſelf a little
faint, enters into a conſideration, that he may
be over-matched; whereupon, a ſad appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of danger ſeizing upon all his ſpirits,
he would gladly have his life beſtowed on
him as a gift, but that, having never been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to yeeld, he knows not how to beg
it. Matchleſs <hi>Crichtoun,</hi> ſeeing it now high
time to put a gallant cataſtrophe to that ſo-long-dubious
combat, animated with a divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-inſpired
fervencie, to fulfil the expectation
of the Ladies, and crown the Dukes illuſtrious
hopes, changeth his garb, fails to act ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, and, from defender, turns aſſailant:
never did Art ſo grace Nature, nor Nature
ſecond the precepts of Art with ſo much live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
and ſuch obſervancie of time, as when,
after he had ſtruck fire out of the ſteel of his
enemies ſword, and gained the <hi>feeble</hi> thereof,
with the <hi>fort</hi> of his own, by angles of the
ſtrongeſt poſition, he did, by Geometrical
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115875:63"/>
flouriſhes of ſtraight and oblique lines, ſo
practically executed the ſpeculative part, that,
as if there had been <hi>Remora</hi>'s and ſecret
charms in the variety of his motion, the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his foe was in a trice tranſqualified into
the numneſs of a pageant. Then was it that,
to vindicate the reputation of the Duke's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and expiate the blood of the three van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
Gentlemen, he alonged a ſtoccade
<hi>de pied ferme;</hi> then recoyling, he advanced
another thruſt, and lodged it home; after
which, retiring again, his rig<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t foot did beat
the cadence of the blow that pierced the belly
of this Italian; whoſe heart and throat being
hit with the two former ſtroaks, theſe three
franch bouts given in upon the back of other:
beſides that, if lines were imagined drawn
from the hand that livered them, to the places
which were marked by them, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
a perfect Iſoſceles Triangle, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
from the top-angle, cutting the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
in the middle; they likewiſe give us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that by them he was to be made a
ſacrifice of atonement for the ſlaughter of the
three aforeſaid Gentlemen, who were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the very ſame parts of their bodies by
other ſuch three Venees as theſe, each whereof
being mortal: and his vital ſpirits exhaling as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115875:63"/>
his blood guſhed out, all he ſpoke was this,
That ſeeing he could not live his comfort
in dying was, for that he could not dye by
the hand of a braver man: after the uttering
of which words he expiring, with the ſhril
clareens of Trumpets, bouncing thunder of
Artillery, bethwacked beating of Drums, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
clapping of hands, and loud acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of joy for ſo glorious a victory, the aire
above them was ſo rarified, by the extremity
of the noiſe and vehement ſound, diſpelling
the thickeſt and moſt condenſed parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
That (as <hi>Plutrach</hi> ſpeakes of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
when they raiſed their ſhouts of allegreſs
up to the very heavens, at the hearing of the
gracious Proclamations of <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi>
in favour of their liberty) the very Sparrows
and other flying Fowls were ſaid to fall to
the ground for want of aire enough to uphold
them in their flight.</p>
            <p>When this ſudden rapture was over, and
all huſht into its former tranquility, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
gallantry and generoſity, beyond expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
of the inimitable <hi>Crichtoun,</hi> did tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them all againe into a new extaſie of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment,
when they ſaw him like an Angel in
the ſhape of a man, or as another <hi>Mars,</hi>
with the conquered enemies ſword in one
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115875:64"/>
hand, and the fifteen hundred Piſtols he had
gained, in the other, preſent the ſword to the
Duke as his due, and the gold to his high
treaſurer, to be diſponed equally to the three
widowes of the three unfortunte gentlemen
lately ſlaine, reſerving only to himſelf the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſatisfaction he conceived, for having ſo
opportunely diſcharged his duty to the houſe
of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader prehaps will think this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful;
and ſo would I too, were it not that I
know (as Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> ſayes) that <hi>a
wonder is no wonder in a wonderful ſubject,</hi>
and conſequently not in him, who for is <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
judgement, valour, eloquence, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>good-followſhip,</hi> was the perfecteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of the joynt labour of the <hi>perfect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of thoſe ſix deities, <hi>Pallas, Apollo, Mars,
Mercury, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> that hath
been ſeen ſince the dayes of <hi>Alcibiades:</hi> for
he was reported to have been inriched with a
memory ſo prodigious, that any Sermon,
Speech, Harangue, or other manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of an hours continuance, he was able
to recite, without heſitation after the ſame
manner of geſture and pronuntiation, in all
points, wherewith it was delivered at firſt:
and of ſo ſtupendious a judgement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115875:64"/>
that almoſt naturally he underſtood
quiddities of Philoſophy: and as for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſeſt
and moſt reſearched myſteries of other
Diſciplines, Arts, and Faculties, the intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Species of them were as readily obvious
to the interiour view and perſpicacity of his
mind, as thoſe of the common viſible colours,
to the external ſight of him that will open his
eyes to look upon them: of which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
and <hi>Encyclopedia</hi> of knowledge,
he gave on a time ſo marvelous a teſtimony at
<hi>Paris,</hi> that the words of <hi>admirabilis Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
the <hi>wonderful Scot,</hi> in all the ſeveral
Tongues, and <hi>Idiomes</hi> of Europ, were (for a
great while together) by the moſt of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho's,
reſounded to the peircing of the very

of praiſe, did the never too much to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
reputation of the <hi>Seraphick</hi> wit of that
eximious man attaine, for his commanding to

and that ſometimes metrically, ſometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes,
<hi>pro libitu.</hi> All this while, the

was called) minding more his Hawking, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

to be made, framed, and woven by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,
Doctors, and others of that thrice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renowned
Univerſity: there aroſe upon him an
aſperſion of too great proneſs to ſuch like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordings
&amp; youthful emancipations, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
one leſs acquainted with himſelf, then
his reputation, to ſubjoyn (ſome two weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

theſe words: <hi>If you would meet with
this monſter of perfection, to make ſearch
for him, either in the Taverne or Bawdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
is the readyeſt way to finde him.</hi>
By reaſon of which expreſſion (though truly
as I think, both ſcandalous and falſe) the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
ſparks of the Univerſity (imagining that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115875:66"/>
thoſe papers of provocation had been ſet up
to nother end, but to ſcoff and delude them,
in making them waſte their ſpirits upon quirks
and quiddities, more then is fitting) did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
a little of their former toyle, and ſlack
their ſtudyes, becoming almoſt regardleſs
thereof, till the ſeveral peals of bells ringing
an hour or two before the time aſſigned, gave
warning that the party was not to flee the
barriers, nor decline the hardſhip of Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
aſſaults: but on the contrary, ſo confident
in his former reſolution, that he would not
ſhrink to ſuſtaine the ſhock of all their diſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
This ſudden alarm ſo awaked them
out of their laſt fortnights Lethargy, that call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to minde, the beſt way they might, the
fruits of the foregoing moneths labour, they
hyed to the fore-named Schoole with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
Where, after all of them had, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their ſeveral degrees and qualities,
ſeated themſelves, and that by reaſon of the
noiſe occaſioned through the great confluence
of people, which ſo ſtrange a novelty brought
thither out of curioſity, an univerſal ſilence
was commanded, the Orator of the Univerſity
in moſt fluent Latine, addreſſing his ſpeech to
<hi>Crichtoun,</hi> extolled him for his literature,
and other good parts, and for that confident
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115875:67"/>
opinion he had of his own ſufficiency, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf able to juſtle in matters of learning
with the whole Univerſity of <hi>Paris. Critch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi>
anſwering him in no leſs eloquent terms
of Latine, after he had moſt heartily thanked
him for his <hi>elogies,</hi> ſo undeſervedly beſtowed,
and darted ſome high <hi>encomions</hi> upon the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity
and the Profeſſors therein; he very
ingenuouſly proteſted, that he did not emit his
<hi>programs</hi> out of any ambition to he eſteemed
able to enter in competition with the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
but meerly to be honoured with the
favour of a publick conference with the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men thereof: in complements after this
manner <hi>ultro citroque habitis,</hi> toſſed to and
again, retorted, contreriſpoſted, backreverted
and now and then graced with a quip or a
clinch for the better reliſh of the ear; being
unwilling in this kind of ſtraining curteſie, to
yeeld to other, they ſpent a full half hour and
more: for he being the centre to which the
innumerable diameters of the diſcourſes of
that circulary convention did tend, although
none was to anſwer, but he, any of them all
according to the order of their preſcribed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
were permitted to reply, or comence new
motions, on any ſubject in what Language ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
and howſoever expreſſed; to all which
he being bound to tender himſelf a reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115875:67"/>
in matter and form ſuitable to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners
propounding, he did firſt ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently
acquit himſelf of that circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
kinde of Oratory, that, by well-couched
periods, and neatly running ſyllables, in all the
the twelve Languages, both in verſe and proſe,
he expreſſed to the life his Courtſhip and
civility: and afterwards, when the Rector of
the Univerſity (unwilling to have any more
time beſtowed on ſuperficial Rhetorick, or
to have that waſted on the fondneſs of quaint
phraſes, which might be better employed in a
reciprocacyof diſcuſſing ſcientifically the nature
of ſubſtantial things) gave direction to the
Profeſſors to fall on, each according to the
dignity or precedency of his Faculty, and that
conform to the order given: ſome Metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
notions were ſet abroach, then Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical;
and of thoſe, Arithmetical, Geometrical,
Aſtronomical, Muſical, Optical, Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,
Trigonometrical, Statical, and ſo forth
through all the other branches of the prime
and mother-Sciences thereof: the next bout
was through all Natural Philoſophy, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Ariſtoles</hi> method, from the Acroama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
going along the ſpeculation of the nature
of the heavens, and that of the generation
and corruption of ſublinary things, even to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115875:68"/>
the conſideration of the ſoul and its faculties:
in ſequel hereof, they had a hint at Chymical
extractions, and ſpoke of the principles of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
and mixed bodies, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of that Art. After this, they diſputed of
medecine, in all its Thereapeutick, Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutick,
and Chirurgical parts; and not leaving
Natural Magick untouched, they had exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
diſceptations concerning the ſecrets there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
From thence they proceeded to Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
where debating of the true enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all vertues and vices, they had moſt
learned ratiocinations about the chief good of
the life of man: and ſeeing the Oecumenicks
and Politicks are parts of that Philoſophy,
they argued learnedly of all the ſeveral ſorts
of governments, with their defects and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;
whereupon perpending, that, without
an eſtabliſhed Law, all the duties of ruling
and ſubjection, to the utter ruine of humane
ſociety, would he be as often violated, as the
irregularity of paſſion, ſeconded with power,
ſhould give way thereto. The <hi>Sorboniſt, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,</hi>
and <hi>Civilian</hi> Doctors moſt judiciouſly
argued with him about the moſt prudential
Maximes, Sentences, Ordinances, Acts, and
Statutes for ordering all manner of perſons in
their conſciences, bodyes, fortunes, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115875:68"/>
nor was there an end put to thoſe literate
exercitations, till the <hi>Grammarians, Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians,</hi>
Poets and Logicians had aſſailed
him with all the ſubtleties and niceſt <hi>quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets</hi>
their reſpective <hi>habits</hi> could afford.
Now when, to the admiration of all that were
there, the incomparable <hi>Crichtoun</hi> had, in
all theſe faculties above written, and in any
of the twelve Languages, wherein he was
ſpoke to, whether in verſe or proſe, held tack
to all the diſputants, who were accounted the
ableſt Scholars upon the earth, in each their
own profeſſion; and publickly evidenced ſuch
an Univerſality of knowledge, and accurate
promptneſs ln reſolving of doubts, diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of obſcurities, expreſſing the members
of a diſtinction in adaequate terms of Art,
explaining thoſe compendious tearms with
words of a more eaſie apprehenſion, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
of the ſublimeſt myſteries to any vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
capacity; and with all excogitable variety
of learning (to his own everlaſting fame) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
after that kinde, the nimble witted
Pariſians from nine a clock in the morning, till
ſix at night; The <hi>Rector</hi> now finding it high
time to give ſome relaxation to theſe worthy
ſpirits, which during ſuch a long ſpace had
been ſo intenſively bent upon the abſtruſeſt
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115875:69"/>
ſpeculations, roſe up, and, ſaluting the Divine
<hi>Crichtoun,</hi> after he had made an elegant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick,
or Encomiaſtick ſpeech of half an
houres continuance, tending to nothing elſe
but the extolling of him for the rare and moſt
ſingular gifts, wherewith God and Nature
had endowed him, he deſcended from his
chaire, and, attended by three or four of the
moſt eſpecial Profeſſors, preſented him with a
Diomond Ring and a purſe ful of Gold; wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to accept thereof, if not as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
proportionable to his merit, yet as a
badge of love, and teſtimony of the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
favour towards him. At the tender of
which ceremony, therewas ſo great a plaudite
in the Schoole, ſuch a humming and clapping
of hands, that all the concavities of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
there about, did teſound with the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
of the noiſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the great honor, thus pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
by him for his literatory accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and that many excellent ſpirits, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the like, would be content to poſtpoſe all
other employments to the enjoyment of their
ſtudyes; he, nevertheleſs, the very next day (to
refreſh his braines, as he ſaid, for the toile
of the former days work) went to the <hi>Louvre</hi>
in a Buff-ſuit, more like a favorite of <hi>Mars,</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:115875:69"/>
then one of the <hi>Muſes</hi> minions; where in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of ſome Princes of the Court, and great
Ladies, that came to behold his gallantry, he
carryed away the Ring fifteen times on end,
and broke as many Lances on the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen.</p>
            <p>When for a quarter of a yeer together, he
after this manner had diſported himſelf (what
Martially, what Scholaſtically) with the beſt
qualified men in any Faculty ſo ever, that ſo
large a City (which is called the words A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement)
was able to afford, and now and
then ſolaced theſe his more ſerious recreations
(for all was but ſport to him) with the allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
imbelliſhments of the tendrer Sexe, whoſe
<hi>inamorato</hi> that he might be, was their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
He on a ſudden took teſolution to leave
the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and return to <hi>Italy,</hi>
where he had been bred for many yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
which deſigne he proſecuting within
the ſpace of a moneth (without troubling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with long journeys) he arrived at the Court
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> where immediately after his
abord (as hath been told already) he fought
the memorable combat, whoſe deſcription is
above related. Here was it that the learned and
valiant <hi>Crichtoun</hi> was pleaſed to caſt anehor,
and fix his abode; nor could he almoſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115875:70"/>
do, without diſobliging the Duke, and
the Prince his eldeſt ſon; by either whereof he
was ſo dearly beloved, that none of them
would permit him by any means to leave their
Court, whereof he was the only <hi>Privado:</hi>
the object of all mens Love, and ſubject of
their diſcourſe: the example of the great ones,
and wonder of the meaner people; the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of the female ſexe, and paragon of his
own; in the glory of which high eſtimation
having reſided at that Court above two whole
yeers, the reputation of gentlemen there was
hardly otherwayes valued, but by the meaſure
of his acquaintance: nor were the young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maryed
Ladies, of all the moſt eminent places
thereabounts, any thing reſpected of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that had not either a lock of his haire, or
copy of verſes of his compoſing. Nevertheleſs it
happening on a <hi>Shrove</hi>-tueſday at night (at
which time it is in <hi>Italy</hi> very cuſtomary for
men of great ſobriety, modeſty, and civil beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
all the reſt of the yeer, to give themſelves
over on that day of <hi>carnavale</hi> (as theycall it)
to all manner of riot, drunkenneſs, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency,
which that they may do with the leaſt

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:115875:70"/>
to ventilate their fopperies, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
intolerable enormities, without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion

<hi>Crichtoun</hi> (who, in the afternoon
of that day, at the deſire of my Lord <hi>Duke</hi>
(the whole Court ſtriving which ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

ſports to excite laughter; neither my Lord, the
Dutcheſs, nor Prince, being exempted from
acting their parts, as well as they could) upon
a theater ſet up for the purpoſe, begun to prank
it, <hi>a la Venetiana)</hi> with ſuch a flouriſh of
<hi>mimick,</hi> and <hi>ethopoetick</hi> geſtures, that all the
courtiers of both ſexes, even thoſe that a little
before that, were fondeſt of their own conceits,
at the fight of his ſo inimitable a garb, from
raviſhing actors, that they were before turned
then raviſhed ſpectators. O with how
great livelineſs did he repreſent the conditions
of all manner of men! how naturally did he
ſet before the eyes of the beholders the rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of all profeſſions, from the overweening
<hi>Monarch,</hi> to the peeviſh <hi>Swaine,</hi> through all
intermediate degrees of the ſuperficial <hi>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or proud <hi>warrior,</hi> diſſembled <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115875:71"/>
heard, envious <hi>artiſan,</hi> vainglorious <hi>maſter,</hi>
and tricky <hi>ſervant;</hi> he did with ſuch variety
diſplay the ſeveral humours of all theſe ſorts
of people, and with a ſo bewitching <hi>Energy,</hi>
that he ſeemed to be the <hi>original,</hi> they the
<hi>counterfeit;</hi> and they the <hi>reſemblance</hi>
whereof he was the <hi>prototype:</hi> he had all the
jeers, ſquibs, flouts, buls, quips, taunts, whims,
jeſts, clinches, gybes, mokes, jerks, with all the
ſeveral kinds of equivocations, and other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical
captions, that could properly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted
to the perſon by whoſe repreſentation
he intended to inveagle the company into a fit
of mirth; and would keep in that miſcelany
diſcourſe of his (which was all for the ſplene,
and nothing for the gall) ſuch a climacterical
and mercurially digeſted method, that when
the fancy of the hearers was tickled with any
rare conceit, and that the jovial blood was
moved, he held it going, with another new
device upon the back of the firſt, and another,
yet another, and another againe, ſucceeding
one another for the promoval of what is a
ſtirring into a higher agitation; till in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the luxuriant period, the <hi>decumanal</hi>
wave of the oddeſt whimzy of al, enforced the
charmed ſpirits of the auditory (for affording
room to its apprehenſion) ſuddenly to burſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115875:71"/>
forth into a laughter; which commonly laſted
juſt ſo long, as he had leaſure to withdraw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the skreen, ſhift off with the help of a
Page, the ſuite he had on, apparel himſelf
with another, and return to the ſtage to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh;
for by that time their tranſported, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parpled,
and ſublimated fancies, by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
operating engines of his ſolacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
had from the hight to which the
inward ſcrues, wheeles, and pullies of his wit
had elevated them, deſcended by degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their wonted ſtations, he was ready for the
perſonating of another carriage; whereof, to
the number of fourteen ſeveral kinds (during
the five hours ſpace that at the Dukes deſire,
the ſollicitation of the Court, and his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation,
he was pleaſed to hiſtrionize it) he
ſhewed himſelf ſo natural a repreſentative, that
any would have thought he had been ſo many
ſeveral actors, differing in all things elſe, ſave
the only ſtature of the body; With this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
above the moſt of other actors,
whoſe tongue, with its <hi>oral</hi> implements, is the
onely inſtrument of their minds diſcloſing,
that, beſides his mouth with its appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he lodged almoſt a ſeveral oratour in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
member of his body; his head, his eyes, his
ſhoulders, armes, hands, fingers, thighs, legs,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115875:72"/>
feet and breaſt, being able to decipher any
paſſion, whoſe character he purpoſed to
give.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he did preſent himſelf with a Crown
on his head, a Scepter in his hand, being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in a purple robe furred with Ermyne: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, with a Miter on his head, a Croſier
in his hand, and accoutred with a paire of
Lawn-ſleeves: and thereafter, with a Helmet
on his head, the Viſiere up, a commanding-ſtick
in his hand, and arayed in a Buff-ſuit,
with a ſcarf about his middle. Then, in a rich
apparel, after the neweſt faſhion, did he ſhew
himſelf (like another <hi>Sejanus)</hi> with a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig
daubed with Cypres powder: in ſequel of
that, he came out with a three corner'd cap on
his head, ſome parchments in his hand, and
writings hanging at his girdle like Chancery
Bills; and next to that, with a furred Gown
about him, an ingot of gold in his hand, and
a bag full of money by his ſide; after all this,
he appeares againe clad in a country-jacket,
with a prong in his hand, and a <hi>Monmouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like-cap</hi>
on his head: then very ſhortly after,
with a Palmers coat upon him, a Bourdon in
his hand, and ſome few cockle-ſhels ſtuck to
his hat, he look't as if he had come in
pilgrimage from <hi>Saint Michael;</hi> immediatly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115875:72"/>
after that, he domineers it in a bare unlined
Gowne, with a pair of whips in the one hand,
and <hi>Corderius</hi> in the other: and in ſuite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he <hi>honder ſpondered</hi> it with a pair of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier-like
breeches, a Mountera-Cap on his
head, and a knife in a wooden ſheath dagger-ways
by his ſide; about the latter end he
comes forth again with a ſquare in one hand,
a rule in the other, and a leather apron before
him: then very quickly after, with a ſcrip by
his ſide, a ſheep-hook in his hand, and a bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
full of flowers to make noſegayes for his
Miſtris: now drawing to a cloſure, he rants it
firſt <hi>in cuerpo,</hi> and vapouring it with gingling
ſpurrs, and his armes a kenbol like a <hi>Don Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ego</hi>
he ſtrouts it, and by the loftineſs of his
gate plaies the <hi>Capitan Spavento:</hi> then in
the very twinkling of an eye, you would have
ſeen him againe iſſue forth with a cloak upon
his arm, in a Livery garment, thereby repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the ſerving-man: and laſtly, at one
time amongſt thoſe other, he came out with a
long gray beard, and bucked ruff, crouching
on a ſtaff tip't with the head of a Barbers
Cithern, and his gloves hanging by a button at
his girdle.</p>
            <p>Thoſe fifteen ſeveral perſonages he did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with ſuch excellency of garb, and exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115875:73"/>
of language, that condignely to perpend
the ſubtlety of the invention, the method of
the diſpoſition, the neatneſs of the elocution,
the gracefulneſs of the action, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
variety in the ſo dextrous performance of
all, you would have taken it for a Comedy
of five Acts, conſiſting of three Scenes, each
compoſed by the beſt Poet in the World, and
Acted by fifteen of the beſt Players that ever
lived, as was moſt evidently made apparent
to all the Spectators, in the fifth and laſt hour of
his Action (which according to our Weſtern
account was about ſix a Clock at night, and
by the Calculation of that Country, half an
hour paſt three and twenty, at that time of
the yeer:) for, purpoſing to leave of with the
ſetting of the Sun, with an endeavour never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
to make his concluſion the maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of the work, he, to that effect, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
all his Spirits together, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failed to be ready at the cal of ſo worthy a
Commander, did by their aſſiſtance, ſo conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate,
ſhuffle, mix and interlace the Geſtures,
inclinations, actions, and very tones of the
ſpeech of thoſe fifteen ſeveral ſorts of men
whoſe carriages he did perſonate, into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
<hi>Ollapodrida</hi> of immaterial morſels
of divers kinds, ſutable to the very Ambroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115875:73"/>

eyes and eares of its ſpectabundal auditorie,
one would have ſworne that they all had
looked with multiplying glaſſes, and that
(like that Angel in the Scripture whoſe voice
was ſaid to be like the voice of a multitude)
they heard in him alone the promiſcuous
ſpeech of fifteen ſeveral Actors; by the various
raviſhments of the excellencies whereof, in
the frolickneſs of a jocound ſtraine beyond
expectation, the logofaſcinated ſpirits of the
beholding hearers and auricularie ſpectators,
were ſo on a ſudden ſeazed upon in their riſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
faculties of the ſoul, and all their vital mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſo univerſally affected in this extremitie
of agitation, that, to avoid the inevitable
charmes of his intoxicating ejaculations, and
the accumulative influences of ſo powerfull a
tranſportation, one of my Lady Dutcheſs
chief Maids of honour, by the vehemencie of
the ſhock of thoſe incomprehenſible raptures,
burſt forth into a laughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the rupture

undergo that emancipatorie task of a ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

demonſtration of his eternally-bound
duty to the houſe of <hi>Mantua</hi> and an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
teſtimony of his never to be altered deſigne,
in proſecuting all the occaſions poſſible to be

prove conducible to the advancement of, and
contributing to the readieſt means for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
thoſe advantages that may beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the faculties of making all his choice

effectual to the long wiſhed for furtherance of

ſereniſſime highneſſes of my Lord Duke, Prince
and Dutcheſs, and of conſecrating with all
addicted obſequiouſneſs, and ſubmiſſive devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his everlaſting obedience to the illuſtrious
Shrine of their joynt commands. Then incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
addreſſing himſelf to the Lords, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and others of that <hi>Rotonda</hi> (which, for his

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115875:76"/>
a look on all the corners thereof, ſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
aminable, and magnetically efficacious, as if
in his eys had bin a muſter of ten thouſand <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi>
eagerly ſtriving who ſhould moſt deeply
pierce the hearts of the ſpectators with their
golden darts. And truly ſo it fell out (that there
not being ſo as much one arrow ſhot in vain)
all of them did love him, though not after the
ſame manner, nor for the ſame end: for, as the
<hi>Manna</hi> of the <hi>Arabian</hi> deſarts is ſaid to have
had in the mouths of the <hi>Egyptian Iſraelites</hi>
the very ſame taſt of the meat they loved beſt: ſo
the Princes that were there did mainly cheriſh
him for his magnanimity and knowledge: his
Courtlineſs and ſweet behaviour being that
for which chiefly the Noblemen did moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
him; for his pregnancie of wit, and
chivalrie in vindicating the honour of Ladies, he
was honoured by the Knights: and the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and other Gentlemen courted him for
his affability, and good fellowſhip; the rich
did favour him for his judgement, and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity:
and for his liberality and munificence,
he was bleſſed by the poor; the old men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
him, for his conſtancie and wiſdome:
and the young for his mirth and gallantry;
the Scholars were enamoured of him for his
learning and eloquence, and the Souldiers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115875:76"/>
for his integrity and valour; the Merchants,
for his upright dealing and honeſty, praiſed
and extolled him; and the Artificers for his
goodneſs and benignity; the chaſteſt Lady of
that place would have hugged and imbraced
him for his diſcretion, and ingenuity: whilſt
for his beauty and comelineſs of perſon he
was (at leaſt in the fervency of their deſires) the
paramour of the leſs continent: he was dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved of the fair women, becauſe he was
handſom; and of the faireſt more dearly, becauſ
he was handſomer: in a word, the affections of
the beholders (like ſo many ſeveral diameters,
drawn from the circumference of their various
intents) did all concenter in the point of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
After a ſo conſiderable inſinuation, and
gaining of ſo much ground upon the hearts of
the auditory, (though in ſhorter ſpace then the
time of a flaſh of lightning) he went on (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
in the ſame thred of the concluſive part
of his diſcourſe, with a reſolution not to cut it,
till the over-abounding paſſions of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
their exorbitant motions, and diſcompoſed
geſtures, through exceſs of joy &amp; mirth, ſhould
be all of them quieted, calmed, &amp; pacified, and
every man, woman, and maid there (according

could ſuggeſt, and (conforme to the matters
variety) elevating or depreſſing, flat or ſharply
accinating it, with that proportion of tone
that was moſt conſonant with the purpoſe)
he had attained unto, and by his verbal har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and melodious utterance, ſetled all their
diſtempered pleaſures, and brought their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
raiſed ſpirits into their former cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls,
he with a tongue tip't with ſilver, after
the various <hi>Diapaſons</hi> of all his other expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
and making of a leg, for the ſpruceneſs
of its courtſie, of greater decorement to him
then cloth of gold and purple, farewel'd the
companie with a complement of one period ſo
exquiſitely delivered, and ſo well attended by
the gracefulneſs of his hand and foot, with
the quaint miniardiſe of the reſt of his body,
in the performance of ſuch ceremonies as are
uſual at a court-like departing, that from the
theater he had gone into a lobbie, from thence
along three ſpacious chambers, whence deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
a back-ſtaire, he paſt through a low
gallerie, which led him to that outter gate,
where a coach with ſix horſes did attend him,
before that magnificent convention of both
ſexes, (to whom that room, wherein they all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115875:77"/>
were, ſeemed in his abſence to be as a body
without a ſoul) had the full leiſure to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their ſpirits (which by the neatneſs of his
ſo curious a cloſe, were <hi>quoquoverſedly</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with admiration) to adviſe on the beſt
expediency how to diſpoſe of themſelvs for the
future of that licentious night: during which
time of their being thus in a maze, a proper
young Lady (if ever there was any in the
world) whoſe diſperſed ſpirits, by her wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
delight in his accompliſhments, were by
the power of <hi>Cupid,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of his
mother, inſtantly gathered and replaced, did
upon his retiring (without taking notice of the
intent of any other) riſe up out of her boxe,
iſſue forth at a poſterne-door, into ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
tranſes, from whence going down a few
ſteps, that brought her to a parlour, ſhe went
through a large hall; by the wicket of one
end whereof, as ſhe entered on the ſtreet, ſhe
encountered with <hi>Crichtoun,</hi> who was but
even then come to the aforeſaid Coach, which
was hers; unto which <hi>ſans ceremony</hi> (wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the frivolous windings of dilatory cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances)
they both ſtepped up together,
without any other in their company, ſave a
waiting gentlewoman that ſate in the furtheſt
ſide of the Coach, a Page that lifted up the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115875:78"/>
boot thereof, and walked by it, and one
Lacky that ran before with a kindled torch in
his hand, all domeſtick ſervants of hers, as
were the Coach-man and poſtillion; who dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
apace (and having but half a mile to
go) did, with all the expedition required, ſet
down my Lady with her beloved mate at the
great gate of her own palace; through the
wicket whereof (becauſe ſhe would not ſtay
till the whole were made wide open) they
entred both; and injunction being given, that
forthwith after the ſetting up of the Coach
and horſes, the gate ſhould be made faſt and
none, more then was already, permitted to
come within her Court that night, they joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
went along a private paſſage, which led
them to a Lanterne Scalier, whoſe each ſtep was
twelve foot long; thence mounting up a paire
of ſtaires, they paſt through and traverſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
nine ſeveral rooms on a floor, before they
reached her bed-chamber; which in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
of the progreſs of their tranſitory walk,
was with ſuch mutual cordialneſs ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
aimed at, that never did the paſſengers
of a ſhip in a tedious voyage, long for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable
winde with greater uniformity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
then the bleſſed hearts of that amorous
and amiable couple, were, without the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115875:78"/>
variety of a wiſh, in every jot united. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
at laſt they entred in it, or rather in
an <hi>Alcoranal</hi> paradiſe; where nothing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the pleaſure of all the ſenſes was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
the weather being a little chil and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh,
they on a blew Velvet couch ſate by
one another, towards a Char-coale fire burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a ſilver <hi>Braſero,</hi> whilſt in the next
room adjacent thereto, a prety little round
table of Cedar-wood was a covering for the
ſupping of them two together: the cates pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, and a week before that time
beſpoke, were of the choiſeſt dainties, and
moſt delicious junkets, that all the territories
of <hi>Italy</hi> were able to afford; and that deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly:
for all the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire could not
produce a completer paire to taſte them: in
beauty ſhe was ſupream, in pedigree equal
with the beſt, in ſpirit not inferiour to any,
and, in matter of affection, a great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of <hi>Crichtoun,</hi> which was none of her leaſt
perfections: ſhe many times uſed to repaire
to my Lady <hi>Dutcheſſes</hi> Court, where now
and then the <hi>Prince</hi> would caſt himſelf (as <hi>a
l'improviſte)</hi> into her way, to catch hold the
more conveniently of ſome one or other
opportunity for receiving her employments;
with the favour whereof he very often
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115875:79"/>
proteſted, if ſhe would vouchſafe to honour
him, and be pleaſed to gratifie his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouors
with her only gracious acceptance of
them, none breathing ſhould be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
that duty with more zeal to her ſervice,
nor reap more inward ſatisfaction in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it; for that his obedience could
not be crowned with greater glory, then by
that of a permanently-fixed attendance upon
her commandments. His Highneſs comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(whereof to this noble Lady he was at
all times very liberal) remained never longer
unexchanged, then after they were delivered;
and that in a coine ſo pretious, for language,
matter, phraſe, and elocution, that he was
ſtill aſſured of his being repayed with intereſt:
by means of which odds of her retaliation, ſhe
(though unknown to her ſelf) conquered his
affections, and he from thenceforth became
her <hi>inamorato:</hi> but with ſo cloſe and ſecret a
minde did he harbour in his heart, that new
love, and nouriſh the fire thereof in his veins,
that remotely skonſing it from the knowledge
of all men, he did not ſo much as acquaint
therewith his moſt intimate friend <hi>Crichtoun;</hi>
who, by that the Sun had depreſt our Weſtern
horizon by one half of the quadrant of his
Orb, did, after ſupper, with his ſweet Lady
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115875:79"/>
(whom he had by the hand) return againe to
the bed-chamber, wherein formerly they were;
and there, without loſing of time (which by
unneceſſary puntilios of ſtrained civility, and
affected formalities of officious reſpect, is very
frequently, but too much laviſhed away, and
heedleſly regarded, by the young <hi>Adoniſes,</hi>
and faint-hearted initiants in the exerciſes of
the <hi>Cytheraean Academy)</hi> they barred all
the ceremonies of <hi>pindariſing</hi> their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and ſprucifying it in <hi>a la mode</hi> ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
their mutual carriage ſhewing it ſelf
(as it were) in a meane betwixt the conjugal
of man and wife, and fraternal converſation
of brother and ſiſter; in the reciprocacy of their
love, tranſcending both; in the purity of their
thoughts, equal to this; and in fruition of
pleaſure, nothing inferior to the other: for
when, after the waiting damſel had, by putting
her beautiful Miſtris into her <hi>Nocturnal</hi> dreſs,
quite impoveriſhed the ornaments of her that
dayes wear, in robbing them of the ineſtimably
rich treaſure which they incloſed; and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the ſame office to the Lord of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
affections, by laying aſide the impeſtring
bulk of his <hi>journal</hi> abiliaments, and fitting
him, in the ſingleſt manner poſſible, with the
moſt genuine habit <hi>a la Cypriana</hi> that <hi>Cupid</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:115875:80"/>
could deviſe; ſhe, as it became an obſequious
ſervant, and maid obſervant of her Miſtriſſes
directions, bidding them good night with the
inarticulate voyce of an humble curteſie, lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the doors of the room behind her, and ſhut
them both in to the reverence of one another,
him to her diſcretion, her to his mercy, and
both to the paſſion of each other: who then
finding themſelves not only together, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
with other, were in an inſtant tranſported
both of them with an equal kinde of rapture:
for as he looked on her, and ſaw the ſplendor
of the beams of her bright eyes, and with
what refulgency her Alabaſter-like skin did
ſhine through the thin cawle of her <hi>Idalian</hi>
garments, her appearance was like the <hi>Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
Oriency of a Weſtern <hi>Aurore,</hi> or <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
riſing of the moſt radiant conſtellation
of the firmament: and whilſt ſhe viewed him,
and perceived the portlineſs of his garb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
of his face, ſweetneſs of his countenance,
and majeſty in his very chevelure; with
the goodlineſs of his frame, proportion of his
limbs, and ſymmetry in all the parts and
joints of his body, which through the cobweb
ſlenderneſs of his <hi>Cyllenian</hi> veſtments, were
repreſented almoſt in their <hi>puris naturalibus</hi>
his reſemblance was like that of <hi>Aeneas</hi> to,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115875:80"/>
               <hi>Dido,</hi> when ſhe ſaid, that he was <hi>in face and
ſhoulders like a god;</hi> or rather to her he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as to the female deities did <hi>Ganimed,</hi> when,
after being carryed up to heaven, he was
brought into the preſence of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Thus for
a while their eloquence was mute, and all they
ſpoke, was but with the eye and hand; yet ſo
perſwaſively, by vertue of the intermutual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitedneſs
of their viſotactil ſenſation, that
each part and portion of the perſons of either,
was obvious to the ſight and touch of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of both; the viſuriency of either, by uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tacturiency of both, made the attrectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent to the inſpection of either:
here was it that Paſſion was active, &amp; Action
paſſive; they both being overcome by other, and
each the conquerour. To ſpeak of her <hi>hirqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talliency</hi>
at the <hi>elevation</hi> of the <hi>pole</hi> of his
<hi>Microcoſme,</hi> or of his luxuriouſneſs to erect a
<hi>gnomon</hi> on her <hi>horizontal</hi> dyal, will perhaps
be held by ſome to be expreſſions full of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcoeneſs,
and offenſive to the purity of chaſte
ears: yet ſeeing ſhe was to be his wife, and
that ſhe could not be ſuch without conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of marriage, which ſignifieth the
ſame thing in effect, it may be thought, as
<hi>definitiones Logicae verificantur in rebus,</hi>
if the exerced act be lawful, that the diction
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:115875:81"/>
which ſuppones it; can be of no great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
unleſs you would call it a <hi>ſolaeciſme,</hi>
or that vice in grammar which imports the
copulating of the maſculine with the feminine
gender. But as the miſery of the life of man
is ſuch, that bitterneſs for the moſt part is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
to pleaſure, and joy the prognoſtick of
grief to come; ſo the admirable <hi>Crichtoun</hi> (or
to reſume my diſcourſe where I broke off,
I ſay it hapened on a Shrovetueſday at night,
that the ever-renowned <hi>Crichtoun)</hi> was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by a great noiſe in the ſtreets, to be ready
for the acting of another part; for the Prince
(who till that time from the firſt houre of the
night incluſively, for the ſpace of four hours
together, with all his attendants, had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but rant it, roar, and roam from
one Taverne to another, with haut-bois, flutes,
and trumpets, drinking healths, breaking
glaſſes, toſſing pots, whitling themſelves with
Septembral juyce, tumbling in the kennel, and
acting all the deviſable feats of madneſs, at
leaſt ſo many as in their irregular judgements
did ſeem might contrevalue all the penance
they ſhould be able to do for them the whole
Lent thereafter) being ambitious to have a kiſs
of his Miſtris hand (for ſo, in that too frolick
humour of his, he was pleaſed to call this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:115875:81"/>
young Lady) before he ſhould go to bed;
with nine Gentlemen at his back, and four
pages carrying waxe tapers before him, comes
to the place where <hi>Crichtoun</hi> and the foreſaid
Lady were (though the Prince knew nothing
of <hi>Crichtoun</hi>'s being there) and knocks at the
outer gate thereof. No anſwer is made at firſt;
for the whole houſe was in a profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,
and all of them in the poſſeſſion of
<hi>Morphee,</hi> ſave that bleſſed pair of pigeon-like
lovers, in whom <hi>Cupid,</hi> for the diſcharge of
<hi>Hymenaean</hi> rites, had inſpired a joynt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to turne that whole nights reſt to
motion: but the fates being pleaſed otherways
to diſpoſe of things then as they propoſed
them, the clapper is up again, and they rap
with a flap, till a threefold clap made the
ſound to rebound. With this the Porter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes,
looks out at a lattice-window of his
lodge, and ſeeing them all with masks and
vizards on their faces, asked them what
their deſire was, or what it might be that mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to come ſo late in ſuch a diſguiſe?
The Prince himſelf anſwered, that they were
Gentlemen deſirous onely to ſalute my Lady;
which courteſie when obtained, they ſhould
forthwith be gone. The porter advertiſeth the
page, and tells him all; who doing the ſame to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115875:82"/>
the waiting Gentlewoman, ſhe, to receive
orders from her Miſtris, opens the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doore,
enters in, relates the ſtory, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
direction from my Lady; who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
bids her call the page to her: ſhe does
it; he comes, and enquiring what the will of
her <hi>ſignoria</hi> was with him, ſhe enjoynes
him to go down and beſeech thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to be pleaſed to have her excuſed for that
night, becauſe ſhe was abed, and not ſo well
as ſhe could wiſh, to bear them company; yet
if they conceived any fault in her, ſhe ſhould
ſtrive to make them amends for it, ſome other
time: the page accordingly acquits himſelf
of what is recommended to him; for after he
had cauſed open the wicket of the gate, and
faced the ſtreet, he firſt ſaluted them, with
that Court-like dexterity, which did beſpeak
him a well-educated boy, and of good paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
then told them, that he was commanded
by his Lady Miſtris to intreat them (ſeeing
ſhe knew not what they were, and that their
wearing of vizards did in civility debar her
from enquiring after their names) to take in
good part her remitting of that their viſit to
another time, by reaſon of her preſent indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
and great need of reſt; which if, they
ſhould have any pretext to except againſt,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115875:82"/>
ſhe would heartily make atonement for it, and
given them ſatisfaction at any other time.
The Princes anſwer was, that he thought not
but that he ſhould have been admitted with
leſs ceremony, and that though the time of the
night, and his Lady-miſtris her being in a
poſture of reſt, might ſeem to plead ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for the non-diſturbance of her deſired
ſolitarineſs; that nevertheleſs the uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
priviledges of the ſeaſon exempting them
from all preſcribed (and at all other times ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)
boundaries, might in the <hi>carnavale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceve,</hi>
and ſupremeſt night of its law tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
jollities, by the cuſtome of the whole
Country, very well apologize for that treſpaſs.
Which words being ſpoken, he, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Page leiſure to reply, pretending it was
cold in the ſtreets, ruſht in at the open wicket
even into the Coutt, with all his gentlemen,
and Torch-bearers, each one whereof was no
leſs cup-ſhotten then himſelf. The Page aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at ſuch unexpected rudeneſs, ſaid, with
an audible voice, What do you mean, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?
do you intend to break in by violence,
and at ſuch an undue time enforce my Lady
to grant you admittance. Look, I pray you, to
your own reputations; and if regardleſs of
any thing elſe, conſider what imputation, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115875:83"/>
ſtain of credit wil lye upon you, thus to commit
an enormous action, becauſe of ſome colour
of juſtifying it by immunities of ſet times,
grounded upon no reaſon but meer toleration,
without any other warrant then a feeble inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
preſcription; therefore let me beſeech
you, gentlemen, if you love your ſelves, and the
continuation of your own good names, or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
anykind of reſpect to the honor of Ladys,
that you would be pleaſed of your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
to chuſe rather to return from whence
you came, or go whither elſwhere you will,
then toimagin anyrational man wil think that
your masks &amp; vizards can be ſufficient covers,
wherewith to hide and palliate the deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
of this obtruſive incivility. One of the
Princes gentlemen (whoſe braines the fumes
of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> wines had a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated)
laying hold only upon the laſt
word (all the reſt having eſcaped both his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination
and memory, like an empty ſound
which makes no impreſſion) and moſt eagerly
graſping at it (like a ſnarling curr, that in his
gnarring ſnatcheth at the taile) ecchoes it,
<hi>incivility;</hi> then coming up cloſer to him, and
ſaying, how now <hi>Jackanapes,</hi> whom do you
twit with incivility, he gave him ſuch a ſound
thwack over the left ſhoulder with his ſword,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115875:83"/>
ſcabard and all, that the noiſe thereof reached
to all the corners of my Ladyes bed-chamber;
at which the generous Page (who beſides his
breeding otherwayes, was the ſon of a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
being a little commoved and vexed at an
affront ſo undeſervedly received, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
given, told the Eſquire who had
wronged him, that if he had but had one drop
of any good blood within him, he never
would have offered to ſtrike a gentleman that
wanted a weapon wherewith to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and that although he was but of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
yeers of age, and for ſtrength but as a
ſpringal or ſtripling in regard of him, he
ſhould nevertheleſs (would any of thoſe other
nine gentlemen (as he called them) be pleaſed
to favour him but with the lend of a ſword)
take upon him even then, and on that place, to
humble his cockes-comb, pull his creſt a little
lower down, and make him faine (for the ſafety
of his life) to acknowledge that he is but a
baſe and unworthy man. Whilſt the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was about to have ſhapen him an anſwer,
the Prince, being very much taken with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
wit, garb, and courage of the boy,
commanded the other to ſilence; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
taking the ſpeech in hand himſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him very much for his loyalty to his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115875:84"/>
Miſtris; and (for his better ingratiating in the
Pages favour) preſented him with a rich Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir,
to ſhew him but the way to my Ladyes
Chamber, where he vowed that (as he was a
gentleman) he would make no longer ſtay then
barely might afford him the time to kiſs her
hands, and take his leave. The ſweet boy (being
more incenſed at the manner of that offer of
the prince (whom he knew not) then at the
diſcourteſie he had ſuſtained by his aforeſaid
gentleman) plainly aſſured him, that he might
very well put up his Saphir into his pocket a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
for that all the gifts in the world
ſhould never be able to gaine that of him,
which had not ground enough in reaſon for
perſwading the grant thereof without them.</p>
            <p>After that the Prince and <hi>Pomponacio</hi> (for
ſo they called the Page) had thus for a long
time together debated to and againe, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for and againſt the intended viſit, with
ſo little ſucceſs on either ſide, that the more
artifice was uſed in the Rhetorick, the leſs ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it had in the perſwaſion: The Prince un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to miſs of his mark, and not having
in all the quivers of his reaſon one ſhaft
wherewith to hit it, reſolved to interpoſe ſome
authority with his argumentations, and where
the foxes skin could not ſerve, to make uſe of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115875:84"/>
the Lyons: to the proſecuting of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
he with his <hi>vinomadefied</hi> retinue, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to preſs in upon the Page, and, maugre his
will, to get up ſtaires, and take their fortune
in the queſt of the Chamber they aimed at:
for albeit the ſtradling as wide as he could, of
pretty <hi>Pomponacio</hi> at the door whereat they
made account to force their paſſage, did for a
while retard their deſigne, becauſe of their
charineſs to ſtruggle with ſo hopeful a youth,
and tender imp of ſo great expectation, yet at
laſt, being loath to faile of their end, by how
indirect meanes ſoever they might attaine
thereto, they were in the very action of crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their violence with prevalency, when the
admirable and ever-renowned <hi>Crichtoun,</hi>
who at the <hi>Princes</hi> firſt manning of the Court

apparelled himſelf with a paludamental
veſture, after the antick faſhion of the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Romans,</hi> both for that he minded not to
make himſelf then known, that to walk then in
ſuch like diſguiſe was the anniverſary cuſtome
of all that country, and that all both gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and others ſtanding in that Court, were in
their maſcaradal garments; with his ſword
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115875:85"/>
in his hand, like a meſſenger from the gods,
came down to relieve the Page from the <hi>poſte</hi>
whereat he ſtood <hi>Sentry;</hi> and when (as the light
of the minor Planets appeares not before the
glorious rayes of <hi>Titan)</hi> he had obſcured the
irradiancy of <hi>Pomponacio</hi> with his more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent
preſence, and that under pretext of
turning him to the Page to deſire him to ſtand
behind him, as he did, he had expoſed the
full view of his left ſide (ſo far as the light of
Torches could make it perceivable) to the
lookers on, who, being all <hi>in cuerpo</hi> carying
ſwords in their hands in ſtead of cloaks about
them, imagined really, by the badge or cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
they ſaw neer his heart, that he was
one of my Ladies chief domeſtick ſervants: he
addreſſed his diſcourſe to the Prince, and the
nine gentlemen that were with him; neither of
all whereof, as they were accoutred, was he
able (either by the light of the Tapers, or that
of the Moon, which was then but in the firſt
week of its waxing, it being the <hi>Tueſday</hi>
next to the firſt new Moon that followed the
purification day) to diſcern in any manner of
way what they were: and for that he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their unſtedfaſt poſtures, that the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the grape had made them ſubjects to
<hi>Jacchus,</hi> and that their extranean-like demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115875:85"/>
towards him (not without ſome amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
did manifeſt his certainty of their not
knowing him; he therefore with another kind
of intonation (that his ſpeech might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
him) then that which waited upon his
uſual note, of utterance, made a pithy Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick
in praiſe of thoſe that endeavoured, by
their good fellowſhip, and Bacchanalian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnionry,
to cheer up their hearts with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
liquour, and renew the golden age; whence
deſcending to a more particular application,
he very much applauded the ten gentlemen, for
their being pleaſed (out of their devotion to
the <hi>Lyaean god,</hi> who had with great reſpect
been bred and elevated amongſt the <hi>Nymphs)</hi>
not to forget, amidſt the moſt ſacred plying of

the infringing of the meaneſt title or particle
of any one thereof, would quite diſconcert
the mutual harmony it ſhould produce, and
bring an unſpeakable diſparagement to the
credits and honors of all guilty of the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency.
In amplifying hereof, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115875:86"/>
upon their paſſions, he let go ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
ſprings, and inward reſorts of eloquence,
that being all perſwaded of the unſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the time, and unreaſonableneſs of the
ſuit, none of them, for a thouſand ducats
that night, would have adventured to make
any further progreſs in that after which a little
before they had been ſo eager: ſo profound
was the character of reverence toward that
Lady, which he ſo inſinuatingly had imprinted
into the hearts of them all; wherefore they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
to inſiſt no longer upon the viſitatory
deſign, did caſt their minds on a ſudden upon
another far more haire-brained conſideration;
when the Prince to one of his chief gentlemen
ſaid, We wil do this good fellow no wrong; yet
before we go hence, let us try what courage is
in him, that after we have made him flee for
it, we may to morrow make one excuſe for all,
to the Lady whom he ſerveth. Do not you
ſee (ſayes he) how he dandleth the ſword in
his hand, as if he were about to braveer us,
and how he is decked and trimm'd up in his
cloaths, like another <hi>Hector</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> but I
doubt, if he be ſo <hi>martial,</hi> he ſpeaks too well
to be valiant: he is certainly more <hi>Mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
then military; therefore let us make him
turn his back, that we may ſpie if, as another
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115875:86"/>
               <hi>Mercury,</hi> he hath any wings on his heels. This
fooliſh chat no ſooner was blattered out to the
ears of three of his gentlemen, that were neareſt
to him, but the ſudden drawing of their ſwords,
though but injeſt, made the other 6 who heard
not the Prince, as if they had bin mad, to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the raſhneſs wherewith the ſpirit of wine
had inſpired them, againſt the prudenſequal &amp;
invincible fortitude of the matchleſs <hi>Crich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun;</hi>
who not being accuſtomed to turn his
back to thoſe that had any project againſt
his breſt, moſt manfully ſuſtained their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter;
which (although furious at firſt) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
nevertheleſs unto him (becauſe of the
odds of ten to one) not to have been in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
he for twenty ſeveral bouts, did but ward
their blows, and pary with the fort of his
ſword, till by plying the defenſive part too
long, he had received one thruſt in the thigh,
and another in the arme; the trickling of his
blood from the wounds whereof, prompted his
heroick ſpirit (as at a deſperate ſtake to
have at all or none) to make his tith outvytheir
ſtock, and ſet upon them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which reſolution
when from the door whereat he ſtood, he had
lanched forth three paces in the Court (having
lovely <hi>Pomponacio</hi> behind him, to give him
warning in caſe of ſurpriſal in the reer, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115875:87"/>
all his ten adverſaries in a front before him,
who, making up above a quadrant of that
periphery whereof his body was the center,
were about, from the exterior points of all their
right ſhoulder-blades, alongſt the additional
line of their armes and tucks, to lodge home
in him ſo many truculent ſemi-diameters) he
retrograding their intention, and beginning
his agency, where they would have made him
a patient, in as ſhort ſpace as the moſt dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatically-skilled

able to deſcribe lines repreſentative of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

to the top of his Meridian hight (which,
with the help of a ruler by ſix draughts of a
pen, is quickly delineated) livered out ſix ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
thruſts againſt them, by vertue whereof he
made ſuch ſpeedy work upon the reſpective
ſegments of that debauch'd circumference,
through the red-ink-marks, which his ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
ſtroaks imprinted, that being alonged
from the <hi>center-point</hi> of his own courage, and
with a thunder-bolt-like-ſwiftneſs of hand ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated
upon their bodies, he diſcuſſed a whole
<hi>quadrant</hi> of thoſe ten, whereof four and
twenty make the <hi>circle;</hi> and laying ſix of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115875:87"/>
the moſt inraged of them on their backs, left
(in the other four) but a <hi>Sextant</hi> of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>ring,</hi> to avenge the death of their diſmal
aſſociates. Of which quaternity, the Prince
(being moſt concerned in the effects of this
diſaſter, as being the only cauſe thereof
(though his intentions levelled at another iſſue)
and like to burſt with ſhame to ſee himſelf
loadned on all ſides with ſo much diſhonour,
by the incomparable valour of one ſingle man)
did ſet forward at the ſwords point, to eſſay if
in his perſon ſo much loſt credit might be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and to that purpoſe comming within

its feeble, was upon the very inſtant of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Highneſs very low, and laying his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
in the duſt, when one of the three Courtiers
whom fortune had favoured not to fall by the
hand of <hi>Crichtoun,</hi> cryed aloud <hi>Hold, hold,
kill not the Prince:</hi> at which words the
courteous <hi>Crichtoun</hi> recoyling, and putting
himſelf out of diſtance, the Prince pulled off
his vizard, and throwing it away, ſhew his

being ſenſible of his miſtake, and ſory
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115875:88"/>
ſo many of the Princes ſervants ſhould have
enforced him, in his own defence, to become
the actor of their deſtruction, made unto the
Prince a very low obeiſance; and ſetting his
left knee to the ground (as if he had been to
receive the honor of Knight-hood) with his
right hand preſented him the hilts of his own
conquering ſword, with the point thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his own breſt, wiſhing his highneſs to
excuſe his not knowning him in that diſguiſe,
and to be pleaſed to pardon what unluckily
had enſued upon the neceſſity of his defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf, which (at ſuch an exigent) might
have befaln to any other, that were not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to abandon their lives to the indiſcretion of
others. The Prince, in the throne of whoſe

lamentable accident, the ſweet and beautiful

with the day: whence having paſt the line, and
ſeeming to depreſs the former pole to elevate

diſcovered a new <hi>America,</hi> or land unknown,
in whoſe ſubterranean &amp; inteſtine cels were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
mines of greater worth, then thoſe of either

Crichtoun!</hi> At which laſt words, the Prince
hearing them uttered by the Lady in the world
he loved beſt, and of the man in the world

by ſuch extremity of ſorrow for the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of that lamentable miſchance, that not
being able to ſuſtaine the rayes of that beauty,
whoſe percing aſpect made him conſcious of
his guilt, he fell flat upon his face, like to a
dead man: but knowing <hi>omne ſimile</hi> not to
be <hi>idem,</hi> he quickly aroſe; and, to make his
body be what it appeared, fixed the hilt of the
ſword wherewith he had killed <hi>Crichtoun,</hi>
faſt betwixt two ſtones, at the foot of a
marble ſtatue ſtanding in the Court (after the
faſhion, of thoſe ſtaves with iron pikes at both
ends (commonly called <hi>Swediſh feathers)</hi>
when ſtuck into the ground to fence Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
from the charge of horſe) then having
recoyled a little from it, was fetching a race
to run his breſt (which for that purpoſe he
had made open) upon the point thereof (as

aſſuredly (according to that his intent) had
made a ſpeedy end of himſelf, but that his

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115875:91"/>
the middle, and the third by taking away
the ſword) hindred the deſperate project of
that <hi>autochtony.</hi> The Prince being carryed
away in that mad, frantick, and diſtracted
humour (befitting a <hi>Bedlam</hi> better then a
<hi>Serralio)</hi> into his own palace, where all
manner of edge-tools were kept from him all
that ſad night, for fear of executing his former
deſigne of ſelf-murther: as ſoon as to his father
my <hi>Lord Duke</hi> on the next morning by ſeven a
clock (which by the uſual computation of that
Country, came at that ſeaſon of the yeer to be
neer upon fourteen hours, or fourteen a clock)
the ſtory of the former nights tragedy was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
&amp; that he had ſolemnly vowed he ſhould
either have his ſon hanged, or his head ſtruck
off, for the committing of a ſo ingrate, enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and deteſtable crime; one of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
told him, that (by all appearance) his
ſon would ſave his highneſs juſtice a labour,
and give it nothing to do; for that he was
like to hang himſelf, or after ſome other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way to turn his own <hi>Atropos.</hi> The
whole Court wore mourning for him full
three quarters of a yeer together: his funeral
was very ſtately, and on his hearſe were ſtuck
more Epitaphs, Elegies, Threnodies, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cediums,

picture till this hour is to be ſeen in the bed-chambers
or galleries of the moſt of the great
men of that Nation, repreſenting him on
horſeback, with a Lance in one hand, and a
Book in the other: and moſt of the young
Ladies likewiſe, that were any thing hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
in a memorial of his worth, had his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figies
in a little oval tablet of gold, hanging
'twixt their breaſts; and held (for many yeers
together) that <hi>Metamazion,</hi> or intermam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary
ornament, an as neceſſary outward
pendicle for the better ſetting forth of their
accoutrements, as either <hi>Fan, Watch,</hi> or
<hi>Stomacher.</hi> My Lord <hi>Duke,</hi> upon the young
Lady that was <hi>Crichtoun</hi>'s Miſtris, and future
wife (although ſhe had good rents and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115875:92"/>
of her own by inheritance) was pleaſed to
conferr a penſion of five hundred ducats a
yeer: the prince alſo beſtowed as much on
her, during all the dayes of his life, which was
but ſhort; for he did not long enjoy himſelf
after the croſs fate of ſo miſerable an accident.
The ſweet Lady (like a <hi>Turtle</hi> bewailing the
loſs of her mate) ſpent all the reſt of her time
in a continual ſolitarineſs; and reſolved, as
none before <hi>Crichtoun</hi> had the poſſeſſion of
her body, that no man breathing ſhould enjoy
it after his deceaſe.</p>
            <p>The verity of this ſtory I have here related
concerning this incomparable <hi>Crichtoun,</hi> may
be certified by above two thouſand men yet
living, who have known him: and truly of
his acquaintance there had been a far greater
number, but that before he was full 32 yeers
of age, he was killed, as you have heard. And
here I put an end to the <hi>Admirable Scot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scene of the choiceſt acts of this late
<hi>Heros</hi> of our time having been the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Italy,</hi> the chief State whereof is
<hi>Venice;</hi> it cannot be amiſs (as I have done

               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:115875:92"/>
and Colonel <hi>Anderſon;</hi> who (within theſe very
few yeers) have done moſt excellent ſervice to
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Commonwealth: nor can I
well forget that Sea-Captain, Captain <hi>William
Scot,</hi> whoſe martial atchievements in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that State againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> may
very well admit him to be ranked amongſt the
Colonels: he was Vice-admiral to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Fleet, and the onely renowned bane
and terror of <hi>Mahometan</hi> Navigators: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they had Galleys, Galeoons, Galiegroſſes,
or huge war-ſhips, it was all one to him; he
ſet upon all alike, ſaying ſtill, The more they
were, the manyer he would kill; and the
ſtronger that the encounter ſhould happen to
be, the greater would be his honour, and his
priſe the richer. He oftentimes ſo cleared the
<hi>Archipelago</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> that the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> family at the very gates of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
would quake at the report of his
victories: and did ſo ferret them out of all
the creeks of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> gulph, and ſo
ſhrewdly put them to it, that ſometimes they
did not know in what part of the mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean
they might beſt ſhelter themſelves from
the fury of his blows: many of their mariners
turned land-ſouldiers for fear of him; and
of their maritime officers, ſeveral took charge
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115875:93"/>
of Caravans, to eſcape his hand, which for
many yeers together lay ſo heavy upon them,
that he was cryed up for another <hi>Don Jean
d' Auſtria,</hi> or <hi>Duke d' Orea,</hi> by the enemies
of that <hi>Scythian</hi> generation; in ſpight of which,
and the rancour of all their unchriſtian hearts,
he dyed but ſome eighteen moneths ago in his
bed of a feaver in the Iſle of <hi>Candia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as beſides thoſe Colonels above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
many other <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Colonels ſince the
<hi>Jubilee</hi> of 1600. till the yeer 1640. have
faithfully ſerved the <hi>Venetian</hi> State againſt
both the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Emperours:
ſo; in the intervals of that time, have theſe
following <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Colonels been in the ſervice
of the King of <hi>Pole,</hi> againſt both the <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coviter,
Turk,</hi> and <hi>Swed;</hi> to wit, Colonel

            <p>And ſeeing we are come ſo far on in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Colonels, who for
the ſpace of thirty or fourty yeers, without rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
the laſt ten, have been ſo famous for
their valour, in the continent of Europe (from

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115875:93"/>
that neither thick nor thin, hunger nor

through thoſe of a mediocer temper of the <hi>Low

this enumeration of <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Colonels into a

even to the almoſt <hi>ſubarctick incolaries,</hi> be

being in his ſtature taller, and greater

the inhabitants of that Country being
more inclined to tender their obedience to a
man of a burly pitch like him, (whoſe magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
being every way proportionable in all its
dimenſions, and conſiſting rather in bones
then fleſh, was no load to the minde, nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
to the activity of his body) then to a
lower-ſized man; becauſe they would ſhun
equality (as near as they could) with him, of
whom they ſhould make choice to be their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign;
they eſteeming nothing more diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
nor of greater diſparagement to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that <hi>State,</hi> then that their King ſhould,
through diſadvantage of ſtatute, be looked
down upon by any whoſe affaires (of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
perhaps for the weal of the Crown)
might occaſion a mutual conference face to
face. He had Ambaſſadors ſent to him to
receive the Crown, Scepter, Sword, and all
the other royal cognizances belonging to the
Supreme Majeſty of that Nation: but I heard
him ſay, that the only reaſon why he refuſed
their ſplendid offers, and would not undergo
the charge of that regal dignity, was, becauſe
he had no ſtomack to be circumciſed: however
this uncircumciſed <hi>Garne,</hi> agnamed the <hi>Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian,</hi>
and upright <hi>Gentile</hi> (for that he loves
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115875:94"/>
good fellowſhip, and is of a very <hi>Gentile</hi>
converſation) ſerved as a Colonel, together with
the forenamed five, and other unmentioned
Colonels of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation in that ſervice,
againſt the <hi>crim Tartar,</hi> under the command
of both his and their compatriot, Sir <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
Leſlie,</hi> Generaliſſimo of all the forces
of the whole Empire of <hi>Ruſſia:</hi> which charge
(the wars againſt the <hi>Tartarian</hi> beginning
afreſh) he hath re-obtained, and is in the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
enjoyment thereof (as I believe) at this
ſame inſtant time; and that with ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
for fidelity and valour, that never
any hath been more faithful in the diſcharge
of his duty, nor of a better conduct in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infinite

            <p>I ſhall only here by the way, before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
any further, make bold to deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to conſider (ſeeing ſo ſhort a ſpace as
thirty or four and thirty yeers time hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
ſo great a number of Colonels, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

<hi>Scotiſh</hi> men to have been ſince they yeere one

out-landiſh wars of <hi>Europe;</hi> which I
cannot think (if prejudicacy be laid aſide) but
that it will ſo diſpoſe the Reader, that he will
acknowledge the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation to have been
an honorable Nation (and that of late too) in
their numerouſneſs of able and gallant men
totally devoted to the ſhrine of <hi>Mars;</hi> of
which ſort as I have omitted many worthy
and renowned Colonels abroad, ſo will I not
inſiſt upon the praiſe of two of our country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Sir <hi>John Hume</hi> of <hi>Eatoun</hi> by name,
and <hi>Francis Sinclair,</hi> natural ſon to the late
Earl of <hi>Catnes;</hi> the firſt whereof in his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
through <hi>Italy,</hi> by his overmaſtering, both
at the blunt and ſharp, the beſt ſwordmen and
fence-maſters of that country, acquired the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the skilfulleſt man in the world at
the Rapeer-point, yet being killed at a battel
in <hi>Denmark</hi> ſome few yeers agoe, to ſhew
that there wanted not another of the ſame
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115875:95"/>
               <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation to ſupply his place, and to
inherit every whit as deſervedly that hight of
fame conferred on him for his valour, the moſt
couragious and magnanimous acts of the
aforeſaid <hi>Francis Sinclair</hi> will manifeſt it
to the full, with almoſt the univerſal teſtimony
of all <hi>Spaine, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which
for many yeers together were the theaters of
his never-daunted proweſs. To relate all the
duels wherein he hath been victorious, and
but to ſum them together, it would amount
to a greater number, then all the leſſons that
the moſt conſciencious maſter of Eſcrime that
is, doth uſually give in a whole three yeers
ſpace, to him whom he intends to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in that faculty: therefore in ſtead of
all (as by the dimenſion of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot,
one may judge of the ſtature of his body; and
by the taſte of a ſpoonful (as the ſaying is) to
know what kinde of liquor is in a Tun) I will
only make mention of two actions of his, one
done at the Emperours Court in <hi>Vienne,</hi> and
the other at <hi>Madrid</hi> in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt was thus: A cerrain gallant noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of high-<hi>Germany</hi> (who by the ſtile of
Conquerour (without any other addition) in
duels, wherein he had overthrown all thoſe of
any Nation that ever coped with him) having
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115875:96"/>
repaired to the great City of <hi>Vienne,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſce
his reputation in ſome more degrees, by
the ſubjection of any proud ſpirit there, eager
in that ſort of conteſtation, whereof he heard
there were many; and notice being given to
him of this <hi>Sinclair,</hi> who had a perfect ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with him in that kind of adventuring
humour, they very quickly met with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had no ſooner exchanged three
words, when time and place being aſſigned
for debating the combate, they determined to
take nothing in hand, till firſt it were made
known, who ſhould (to the very hazard of
their lives) bear clear away the palme, and
reap the credit of the braveſt Champion: but
the news thereof being carryed to the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
(who being unwilling that the victor ſhould
terminate the concertation in the blood of the
vanquiſhed, and yet deſirous for his own
ſport, that by them ſomewhat might be done
before him, in matter of tryal which of them
ſhould prove moſt skilful in the handling of
his armes) he enjoyned them, at a perfixed
time, in his own preſence to decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
with Foyles: and for the better ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
them thereto, aſſured them, that which
of them ſoever ſhould give the other the firſt
three free bouts, ſhould, for his ſalary or <hi>epini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:115875:96"/>
have a paire of Spurs of beaten Gold
ſet with Diamonds. The combatants very
heartily embraced the condition, and were
glad to turn the ſharp to blunt, to gaine the
Gold Spurs: by which means, their hope of
overcoming on both ſides, having cheerfully
brought them to the appointed place and time
deſigned for the purpoſe, they had no ſooner
adjuſted themſelves in equal termes for Foyles
and every thing elſe befitting that jeopardleſs
monomachy, but <hi>Sinclair</hi> (at firſt, before he
came within full diſtance, to try the manner of
his adverſaries play) made a flouriſh or two
of very nimble and moſt exquiſite falſifyings;
whereat the other (conceiving them for real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-intended
thruſts) was ſo diſordred in his
motion, that, offering to ward, where he
needed not, and taking the Alarm too hot,
<hi>Sinclair</hi> was ſo confident of his own ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
againſt that <hi>High-Dutchman,</hi> that
when he had askt the Emperor, for how many
Franch bouts his Majeſty would adjudge the
Spurs to be gained, and that the Emperor's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was, For the firſt three; <hi>Sinclair</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
If he did not give him five on end, he
ſhould be content to forfeit the Spurs, and two
hundred Crowns beſides: whereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

cannot pary when they ſhould) with the coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantanean
ſwiftneſs of hand and foot, gave
him <hi>de pie-forme,</hi> a terrible ſlap on the breaſt,
wherewith the <hi>German</hi> Lord did ſo ſtagger,
that before he could fully recover himſelf, the
blow was doubled, and redoubled, with a
ſound thwack on the back of thoſe, ſeconded
with another bounce, not leaving him, till with
a puſh, and a thump again he had hit him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſeveral times, and that with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
&amp; facility, that the uſher of a fencing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall
uſeth to alonge againſt his Maſters pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtron.
The Emperour, by the thud of each
ſtroak, which farthered his counting, having
reckoned beyond the number of the five pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
bouts, and unwilling <hi>Sinclair</hi> ſhould
lack of his due, or the other have his ribs
broken, cryed aloud, <hi>Hola,</hi> forbear, enough:
whereupon the duelliſts deſiſting, the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
required them both to ſtand before him;
who ſeeing the ſeven marks which the button
of <hi>Sinclairs</hi> foyle, whitened with chalk, had
imprinted in the others black Sattin doublet,
and how they lay in order after the manner of
the ſituation of the ſeven Stars of the little
Bear, laughed heartily (for he was a peece of
an <hi>Aſtronomer,</hi> and a great favourer of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115875:98"/>
               <hi>Mathematicians)</hi> then addreſſing his ſpeech
to <hi>Sinclair</hi> (who had ſo much natural <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,</hi>
as to know that ſeven included
five) asked him, why in livering in of his
thruſts he exceeded the promiſed number, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
five was ſuſficient for gaining of the prize;
and why being pleaſed to make them ſeven,
he had fixed them in their ſtations after the
faſhion of a <hi>Charlewaine? Sinclair</hi> (to
whom though <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> might have ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
ſomewhat to eat, for any thing he knew
of the Science, had nevertheleſs the perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to make the word <hi>Charlewaine</hi> ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his preſent purpoſe) very promptly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>Sir, I did ſo place them, in honour
of my maſter</hi> CHARLES <hi>King of great</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<hi>and gave in two venees more then I
was obliged to, to give your Caeſarean Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to underſtand, that, in the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>whereof
that Iſle conſiſts, there are many thouſands
more expert then I, in matter of Martial
feats.</hi> At which anſwer the Emperor was ſo
well pleaſed, that he gave him the Spurs as
his due for the firſt five, and a gold chaine for
the other two.</p>
            <p>In the mean while (for the Emperors better
diverſion) a certain Spaniſh <hi>Hidalgo</hi> of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115875:99"/>
               <hi>Archduke Leopoldo</hi>'s Court, made bold to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to his Imperial Majeſty, how the ſaid <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Sinclair</hi> had in the City of <hi>Madrid</hi>
performed a more notable exploit, and of
far greater adventure, which was this.</p>
            <p>Eight <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentlemen being ſuſpicious
of <hi>Sinclair's</hi> too intimate familiarity with a
kinſwoman of theirs (whom they called
<hi>Prima,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>a ſhe-cozen)</hi> did all
together ſet upon him at one time, with their
ſwords drawn; which unexpected aſſault mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to ſay, <hi>Gentlemen, I doubt not but
you are valiant men; therefore if you would
have your deſire of me, my intreaty is only
that you would take it as it becòmes men of
valour, and that by trying your fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
mine, at the ſwords point, one after
another.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretending to be
men of honour, not only promiſed to do
what he required, but, the better to aſſure him
that they would prove faithful to him in their
promiſe, ſwore all of them upon a croſs which
they made with their ſwords, that they
would not faile therein, ſhould it coſt them
all their lives. In the extremity that <hi>Sinclair</hi>
was, this kind of unhoped-for honeſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
did very much incourage him, eſpecially
he knowing that he and they all had but <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo-blades,</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:115875:99"/>
whoſe faſhion was then to be all
of one length and ſize; in a word, conforme
to paction, they fell to it, and that moſt clever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
though with ſuch fatality on the Spaniſh
ſide, that in leſs then the ſpace of half an
hour he killed ſeven of them <hi>Epaſſyterotical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that is, one after another; gratifying the
eighth (to teſtifie he had done no wrong to the
reſt) with the enjoyment of his life, who, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to undergoe the hazard of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny
of his fore-runners, chuſed to abandon
his vindicative humour, and leave unrevenged
the blood and honour of his male and female
coſens.</p>
            <p>Much more may be ſaid of him, but that
I will not now ſupererogate in magnifying the
fulfilment of the Readers expectation, by the
performance of more then I promiſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved, for brevities ſake, to paſs over
with ſilence many hundreds of our country
(ſuch as <hi>Robert Scot,</hi> who was the deviſer
of Leathern guns) that were in other parts
much eſteemed for their inventions of warlike
Engines.</p>
            <p>And that ſince the yeer a thouſand and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred,
before which time no action hath
been performed anywhere, nor from that
time, till this within the Iſle of <hi>Britain,</hi> by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115875:100"/>
any of thoſe Colonels and others, whom I
have here before recited, for which I have
praiſed them, or otherwaies mentioned any
of them; but by way of deſignation of
their names, in relation to their ſervice abroad:
nor amongſt them all have I nominated above
five or ſix, that either ſerved in, or did ſo
much as look upon the wars of <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and yet I expect
not to merit blame, albeit of thoſe general
perſons, and Colonels of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation
(whereof there is a great multitude) that have
ſerved (ſince the yeer 1641.) in theſe our late
wars of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
make no mention, becauſe <hi>multitudo</hi> is no
more <hi>virtus</hi> then <hi>magnitudo;</hi> for though
there be ſome (and thoſe but very ſome) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, that have been pretty well prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
in reaſon, and had true honor before
their eyes; yet ſeeing the great mobil of the
reſt, by circumvolving them into a contrary
motion, hath retarded their action, and made
their vertue abortive, in not expreſſing their
names, I do them favour, by ſuch conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
obviating the imputation, which they
deſerve for having been in ſo bad company,
and underſphering themſelves to the bodies of
thoſe vaſter orbs (whether of the State, Milice,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115875:100"/>
or Church of <hi>Scotland)</hi> whoſe rapidity of
violence might hurry them into a courſe quite
oppoſite to the goodneſs of their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For whoever they be (whether civil or
Eccleſiaſtical) of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, whom
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> can with any kind of reaſon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
with covetouſneſs, the Commons of
<hi>Scotland</hi> with oppreſſion, or other States
and Countryes with treachery and diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it is my opinion, that their names ſhould
not otherwayes be recorded, but as Beacons
are ſet up where there are dangerous paſſages
by Sea, that ſuch thrifty navigators (whether
coetaneans or ſucceſſors) as intend to ſaile
with ſafety into the harbour of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may thereby avoid the rocks and ſhelves
of their greedy, Tyrannous, and hypocritical
dealings: nor can it be a ſufficient excuſe for
any of thoſe officers to ſay they thought they
could not offend God therein, for that the
Kirk did warrant them in what they did; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they might very well know, that it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſuch, as would take upon them a charge
over and againſt the lives of others in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
preſervation and deſtruction of their
ſouldier-friends and foes, to have principles
within themſelves for the regulating of their
outward actions, and not to be driven like
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115875:101"/>
fools for advice ſake to yeeld an implicite obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the oracles of the <hi>Delphian</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
whoſe greateſt Enthuſiaſts (for all its
cryed-up infallibility) have not poſſibly the
skill to diſtinguiſh betwixt Rape-ſeed and
Musket-powder. If any ſay that by taking
ſuch a courſe, their motion ſeems to be the
more Celeſtial, becauſe (in imitation of the
upper Orbs) it is furthered by the aſſiſtance
of an external <hi>intelligence;</hi> I anſwer, that
according to the opinion of him in whoſe
Philoſophy they read thoſe ſeparated animati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to each of the heavens is allowed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant
as well as aſſiſting ſoul: and though
that were not, the <hi>intelligences</hi> are ſo far
different, that there is hardly any ſimilitude,
whereupon to fixe the compariſon: for <hi>thoſe</hi>
ſuperior ones are <hi>pure ſimpliciſſim acts,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſceptible
of paſſion, and without all matter,
or potentiality of being affected with any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;
but <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>groſs mixed patients,</hi>
ſubject to all the diſorders of the inferiour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
plunged in terreſtrial droſs, and for
their profit or lucre in this world, lyable to any
new impreſſions. That the Gentry then, and
Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereof for the moſt
part did conſiſt thoſe freſh-water-officers,
ſhould by their codrawing in the Presbyterian
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115875:101"/>
yoak, have plowed ſuch deep and bloody
furrows upon the backs of the commons of
their own native ſoyle, is not only abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
but a thing ridiculous, and an extream
ſcandal to the Nation: for when ſome <hi>Laird</hi>
or <hi>Lord</hi> there (whoſe tender conſcience could
embrace no Religion that was not gainefull)
had, for having given his voice (perhaps) to
the augmentation of a Miniſters ſtipend, or
done ſuch like thing tending to the glory of the
new <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> obtained a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
for the levying of a Regiment of horſe,
foot, or dragoons, under pretext of fighting
for <hi>God</hi> againſt the <hi>Malignants</hi> and <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi>
then was it that by unceſſant quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
exacting of trencher-money, and other
moſt exorbitant preſſures upon the poor ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andry
of that country, ſuch cruelty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
villany was uſed, and that oftentimes
by one neighbour to another, under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of maintaining the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the cauſe
of <hi>God,</hi> that hardly have we heard in any age
of ſuch abominations done by either Turk or
Infidel: and all out of a devotion to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſum of money, which the maſter of
theſe oppreſſed tenants, for ſaving of his land
from being laid waſt, muſt needs disburſe: for
moſt of thoſe Kirk-officers of Regiments, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115875:102"/>
their <hi>ſubordinado's,</hi> were but very ſeldom
well pleaſed with the production of either man
or horſe, how apt ſoever they might ſeem to
prove for military ſervice, alledging ſome
fault or other to the horſe; and that the man,
for lack of zeal (for any thing they knew) to
the Covenant, might procure a judgement
from heaven upon the whole army; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would take but money, thereby the
better to enable them to provide for ſuch men
and horſes, as they might put confidence into.
And if it chanced (as oftentimes it did) that
a country-Gentleman, out-putter of foot or
horſe, being ſcarce of money, ſhould prove
ſo untractable, as to condeſcend to nothing
but what literally he was bound to; then by,
vertue of the power wherewith they were
intruſted, to ſee their ſouldiers well clothed,
armed, and accommodated with tranſport-money,
and other ſuch appurtenances, they
had ſuch a faculty of undervaluing whatever
was not good ſilver and gold, that, to make
up the deficiencies, according to their rates,
would extend to ſo great a ſum, that hardly
could any lyable to a levy, that was refractary
to their deſire of having money ſave ſo much
as one ſingle ſixpence by his emiſſion of either
horſe or foot: ſo fine a trick they had with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115875:102"/>
their counterfeit Religion, to make an honeſt
poor gentlemen glad to chuſe the worſt of
two evils, for ſhunning a third of their own
contrivance, worſe then they both.</p>
            <p>And when at any time the innocent Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in hope of commiſeration would preſent
their grievances to the reſpectvie Committees of
the Shires, ſeldom or never was there any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of, or reparation for the aforeſaid abuſe:
eſpecially in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of all the
parts whereof, the Committees of the Shires
of <hi>Innernaſs</hi> and <hi>Roſs,</hi> whether joyntly or
ſeparately ſitting, proved the moſt barbarous
and inhumane; it being a commonly-receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
practiſe amongſt their loggerhead ſtick
wiſdoms, not only to paſs theſe and ſuch like
enormities with the foreſaid officers, but to
gratifie them beſides, for the laying of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
upon their neighbours, which they ſhould
have undergone themſelves: yea, to ſuch a
height did their covetouſneſs and hypocriſie
reach, that the better to ingratiate themſelves
in the favors of the ſouldiery, for the ſaving of
their pence, when the officers (out of their lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
would be unwilling to travel fourty or
fifty miles from their quarters for the taking
up of mantenance, or any arreer due of horſe
and foot-levies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they took this ſavage and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115875:103"/>
courſe, they would point at any
whom they had a peck at, pretending he was
no good Covenanter, and that he favoured
toleration; and for that cauſe (being both
judges and parties themſelves) would ordaine
him, under pain of quartering and plundring,
to advance to the inſatiable officers ſo much
money, as the debt pretended to be due by
thoſe remote inhabitants (though meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to him) did extend to: by which means
it ordinarily fell out, that the civilleſt men in
all the country, and moſt plyable to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
were the greateſt ſufferers; and the baſeſt,
the greedyeſt, and the moſt unworthy of the
benefit of honeſt converſation, the onely
men that were exempted, and had immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Now, when many of theſe Laird and Lord
Kirk-officers had, by ſuch unconſcionable
means, and ſo diametrally oppoſite to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and common honeſty, acquired great
ſums of money, then was it that, like good
<hi>Simeons</hi> of iniquity, they had recourſe to their
brother <hi>Levi,</hi> for framing of Proteſtations;
their conſcience not ſerving them to fight for a
King, that was like to eſpouſe a malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt;
under which cover, free from the
tempeſt of war (like fruitful brood-geeſe)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115875:103"/>
they did ſtay at home to hatch young chickens
of pecunial intereſt, out of thoſe prodigious
egs which the very ſubſtance of the commons
had laid down to them (with a curſe) to ſit
upon.</p>
            <p>Yet, if for faſhion ſake, at the inſtigation
of inferior officers, who were nothing ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
as they, ſome ſhew of muſter was to be
made of ſouldiers to be ſent to <hi>Sterlin</hi>-leaguer,
or anywhere elſe; then were theſe ſame very
men, whom (out of their pretended zeal to the
good cauſe) they had formerly caſt, either
for malignancy or infencibility, and in lieu of
each of them accepted of fifty or threeſcore
dolars, more or leſs, inrolled in their Troops
or Companies; when for the matter of three
or four dolars, with the conſent of a cup of
good Ale, and ſome promiſe of future plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they had purchaſed their good wils to
take on with them; they approving themſelves
by ſuch inſinuating means, good ſervants, in
being able by the talent of their three dolars,
to do the State that ſervice, for the which the
poor Country-Gentleman muſt pay three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore,
and be forced to quit his man to
boot.</p>
            <p>Truly thoſe are not the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Colonels
whom I intend to commend for valour, it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115875:104"/>
being fitter to recommend them to poſterity,
as vipers, who, to work out a livelihood to
themſelves, have not ſtuck to tear the very
bowels of their mother-country, and bury its
honor in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Such were not thoſe <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Col. I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned, whoſe great vaſſalages abroad,
and enterpriſes of moſt magnanimous adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
undertaken and performed by them in
other countries, might very well make a poorer
climate then <hi>Scotland</hi> enter in competition
with a richer ſoyle.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing the intellectual faculties have
their vertues as well as the moral; and that
learning in ſome meaſure is no leſs commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
then fortitude, as thoſe afore-named
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> men have been famous beyond ſea
for the military part, ſo might I mention
thrice as many moe of that Nation, as I have
ſet down, of war-like officers, who ſince the
yeer one thouſand and ſix hundred, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
in all thoſe aforeſaid countryes of
<hi>France, Italy, Spaine, Flanders, Holland,
Denmark, Germany, Pole, Hungary,</hi> and
<hi>Swedland,</hi> where they lived, great renown
for their exquiſite abilities in all kind of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the greateſt part of whoſe names I deem
expedient for the preſent to conceal, thereby
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115875:104"/>
to do the more honor to ſome, whoſe mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity
and other good parts now to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate,
would make one appear (in the
opinions of many) guilty of the like treſpaſs
with them, that, in the dayes of <hi>Nero,</hi> called
<hi>Rome</hi> by its proper name, after he had
decreed to give it the title of <hi>Neroniana.</hi>

            <p>Nevertheleſs being to ſpeak a little of ſome

Engliſh, what in proſe, what in verſe, then
he hath lived yeers; and although I cannot

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115875:105"/>
Treatiſes, whoſe titles I either know not, or
have forgot.</p>
            <p>Beſides all theſe Volumes, Books, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
here recited, he compoſed above three
hundred exquiſite Sermons, which (after he
had redacted them into an order and diction
fit for the preſs) were, by the mercileſs fury of
<hi>Vulcan,</hi> deſtroyed all in one night, to the
great grief of many preachers, to whom they
would have been every whit as uſeful as <hi>Sir
Edward Cooks</hi> reports are to the Lawyers.
But that which I as much deplore, and am
as unfainedly ſory for, is, that the fire, which
(on that fatal night) had ſeazed on the houſe
and cloſet where thoſe his Sermons were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
had totally reduced to aſhes the very
desks wherein were locked up ſeveral <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical,
Phyſical, Moral,</hi> and <hi>Dialecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Manuſcripts; whoſe conflagration by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
is as much to be bewailed, as by
Theologically-affected ſpirits, was that of his
moſt divine elucubrations.</p>
            <p>This loſs truly was irrecoverable, therefore
by him at laſt digeſted, becauſe he could not
help it: but that ſome loſſes of another nature,
before and after that time by him ſuſtained,
have as yet not been repaired, lyeth as a load
upon this land, whereof I wiſh it were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115875:106"/>
ſeeing it is in behalf of him, who
for his piety, Theological endowments, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
Eloquence, and Poeſie, is ſo eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
qualified, that (according to the <hi>Metemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſychoſis</hi>
of <hi>Pythagoras)</hi> one would think,
that the ſouls of <hi>Socrates, Chryſoſtome, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,
Ciceron,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into the ſubſtantial faculties of that
<hi>entelechy,</hi> wherewith, by ſuch a conflated
tranſanimation, he is informed and ſublimely
inſpired. He ſpends the ſubſtance of his own
lamp, for the weal of others; ſhould it not
then be recruited with new oyle by thoſe that
have been enlightened by it? Many enjoy
great benefices (and that deſervedly enough)
for the good they do to their coaevals onely;
how much more meritoriouſly ſhould he then
be dealt with, whoſe literate erogations reach
to this and after-ages? A leaſe for life of any
parcel of land is of leſs value, then the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
purchaſe thereof: ſo he of whom po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterior
generations reap a benefit, ought more
to be regarded, then they whoſe actions pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
with themſelves. Humane reaſon, and
common ſenſe it ſelf inſtructeth us, that dota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
mortifications, and other honorary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences,
ſhould be moſt ſubfervient to the
uſe of thoſe, that afford literatory admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularies
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115875:106"/>
of the longeſt continuance, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
            <p>Therefore could I wiſh (nor can I wiſh a
a thing more juſt) that this reverend, worthy,
and learned gentleman <hi>Maſter Roſſe,</hi> to
whom this age is ſo much beholden, and for
whom poſterity will be little beholden to this
age, if it prove unthankful to him, were (as
he is a favorite of <hi>Minerva)</hi> courted by the
opulent men of our time, as <hi>Danae</hi> was by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter;</hi>
or that they had as much of <hi>Mecaena's</hi>
ſoul, as he hath of <hi>Virgil's:</hi> for if ſo it were,
or that this Iſle, of all Chriſtendom, would but
begin to taſte of the happineſs of ſo wiſe a
courſe, vertue would ſo proſper, and learning
flouriſh, by his encouragements, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of others in imitation of him, that
the Chriſtians needed lie no longer under the
reproach of ignorance, which the oriental Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
fixe upon them in the termes of ſeeing
but with one eye; but in the inſtance of great
Britain alone (to vindicate (in matter of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
the reputation of this our Weſtern
world) make the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> by very force of
reaſon (of whoſe authority above them they
are not aſhamed) be glad to confeſs, that the
<hi>Europaeans,</hi> as well as themſelves, look out
with both their eyes, and have no blinkard
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115875:107"/>
minds. Of which kind of brave men, renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for perſpicacy of ſight in the ready perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of intellectual objects, and that <hi>in gradu
excellenti,</hi> is this <hi>Maſter Roſſe:</hi> the more
ample expreſſing of whoſe deſerved <hi>Elogies,</hi>
that I remit unto another time, will I hope
be taken in better part, that I intend to praiſe
him againe; becauſe <hi>Laus</hi> ought to be
<hi>virtutis aſſecla;</hi> and he is alwayes doing
good.</p>
            <p>Therefore leſt I ſhould interrupt him, I will
into <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and other countries, to
take a view of ſome great ſcholars of the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, who of late have been high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſteemed for their learning in forraign parts:
of which number, he that firſt preſents himſelf
is one <hi>Sinclair,</hi> an excellent Mathematician,
<hi>profeſſor Regius,</hi> and poſſeſſor of the chaire
of <hi>Ramus</hi> (though long after his time) in the
Univerſity of <hi>Paris:</hi> he wrote beſides other
books, one in <hi>folio, de quadratura circuli.</hi>
Of the ſame profeſſion, and of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
there was one <hi>Anderſon,</hi> who likewiſe
lived long in <hi>Paris,</hi> and was for his abilities
in the Mathematical Sciences, accounted the
profoundlyeſt principled of any man of his
time: in his ſtudyes he plyed hardeſt the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Algebra,</hi> the ſpeculations of the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115875:107"/>
lines, the proportions of regular bodies,
and ſections of the cone; for though he was
excellently well skilled in the Theory of the
planets, and Aſtronomy; the Opticks, Catop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks,
Dioptricks, the Orthographical, Stereo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphicial,
and Schenographical projections;
in Coſmography, Geography, Trigonometry,
and Geodeſie; in the Staticks, Muſick, and all
other parts or pendicles, Sciences, Faculties, or
Arts of, or belonging to the diſciplines Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
in general, or any portion thereof
in its eſſence or dependances: yet taking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to pry into the greateſt difficulties, to
ſoar where others could not reach, and (like
another <hi>Archimedes)</hi> to work wonders by
Geometry, and the ſecrets of numbers; and
having a body too weak to ſuſtaine the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
intenſiveneſs of ſo high a ſpirit, he dyed
young, with that reſpect nevertheleſs to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
ages, that he left behind him a <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humary</hi>-book,
intituled <hi>Anderſom opera,</hi>
wherein men verſed in the ſubject of the things
therein contained, will reap great delight and
ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>There was another called <hi>Doctor Seaton,</hi>
not a Doctor of Divinity, but one that had his
degrees at <hi>Padua,</hi> and was <hi>Doctor utriuſque
juris;</hi> for whoſe pregnancy of wit, and vaſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115875:108"/>
skill in all the myſteries of the Civil and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Laws, being accounted one of the ableſt
men that ever breathed, he was moſt hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſired by Pope <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbane</hi> the eighth to
ſtay at <hi>Rome;</hi> and the better to encourage
him thereto, made him chief profeſſor of the
<hi>Sapience</hi> (a Colledge in <hi>Rome</hi> ſo called)
where although he lived a pretty while with
great honor and reputation, yet at laſt,
(as he was a proud man) falling at ſome ods
with <hi>il collegio Romano,</hi> the ſupreameſt ſeat
of the Jeſuites, and that wherein the general
of that numerous ſociety hath his conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,
he had the courage to adventure co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
with them where they were ſtrongeſt, and
in matter of any kind of learning, to give defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to their greateſt ſcholars; which he did
do with ſuch a hight of ſpirit, and in ſuch a
lofty and bravaſhing humour, that (although
there was never yet that Eccleſiaſtical incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
wherein there was ſo great univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality
of literature, or multiplicity of learned
men) he nevertheleſs miſregarding what eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
they were in with others, and totally
repoſing on the ſtock or baſis of his own
knowledge, openly gave it out, that if thoſe
<hi>Teatinos</hi> (his choler not ſuffering him to give
them their own name of Jeſuites) would offer
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115875:108"/>
any longer to continue in vexing him with
their frivolous chat, and captious argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to the impugning of his opinions (and
yet in matters of Religion, they were both
of one and the ſame faith) he would (like a
<hi>Hercules</hi> amongſt ſo many <hi>Myrmidons)</hi> fal
in within the very midſt of them, ſo beſquat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them on all ſides, and, with the granads
of his invincible arguments, put the braines
of all and each of them in ſuch a fire, that
they ſhould never be able (pump as they
would) to finde in all the celluls thereof one
drop of either reaſon or learning, wherewith
to quench it.</p>
            <p>This unequal undertaking of one againſt ſo
many, whereof ſome were greater courtiers
with his Papal Holineſs then he, ſhortened his
abode at <hi>Rome;</hi> and thereafter did him ſo
much prejudice in his travels through <hi>Italy,</hi>
and <hi>France,</hi> that when at any time he became
ſcarce of money (to which exigent his prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
often brought him) he could not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expect an <hi>ayuda de coſta</hi> (as they call it)
or <hi>viaticum</hi> from any Prince of the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
through which he was to paſs; becauſe
the chanels of their liberality were ſtopped, by
the rancour and hatred of his conventual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:115875:109"/>
When nevertheleſs he was at the loweſt ebb
of his fortune, his learning, and incomparable
facility, in expreſſing any thing with all the
choiceſt ornaments of, and incident varieties
to the perfection of the Latine elocution, raiſed
him to the dignity of being poſſeſſed with the
chair of <hi>Lipſius,</hi> and profeſſing humanity
(in <hi>Italy</hi> called <hi>buone letere)</hi> in the famous
Univerſity of <hi>Lovan:</hi> yet (like <hi>Mercury)</hi>
unapt to fix long in any one place, deſerting <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi>
he repaired to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was held
in exceeding great reputation for his good parts
and ſo univerſally beloved, that both Laicks
and Church-men, courtiers and Scholars,
gentlemen and Merchants, and almoſt all
manner of people, willing to learn ſome new
thing or other (for, as ſayes <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> every
one is deſirous of knowledge) were ambitious
of the enjoyment of his company, and ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with his converſation. For beſides that
the matter of his diſcourſe was ſtrong, ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and witty, he ſpoke Latine, as if he had
been another <hi>Livy</hi> or <hi>Saluſtius;</hi> nor, had he
been a native of all the three countryes of
<hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> could he have
expreſt himſelf (as ſtill he did when he had
occaſion) with more ſelected variety of words,
nimbler volubility of utterance, or greater
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115875:109"/>
terity, for tone, phraſe, and accent in all the
three Languages thereto belonging.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen him circled about at the <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre,</hi>
with a ring of <hi>French</hi> Lords and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who hearkned to his diſcourſe with ſo
great attention, that none of them, ſo long as
he was pleaſed to ſpeak, would offer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
him; to the end that the pearles fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from his mouth, might be the more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

viſit him at his houſe, to get his advice in hard

with a golden pen, in acknowledgement of

1627. had a penſion of King <hi>Philip</hi> the
fourth, of ſix hundred ducats a yeer, for his
skilfulneſs in the <hi>Hebrew, Caldean, Syraick,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115875:112"/>
Aethiopian, Samaritan,</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi>
tongues, beyond all the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that ever
were born in <hi>Europe.</hi> The ſervice he did do the
Spaniſh King in thoſe languages (eſpecially
the <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Caldean</hi> (which, after great
ſearch made over all his ample territories, and
ſeveral other Kingdoms beſides, for ſome able
man to undergo the task, could not be got
performed by any but him) was to tranſlate
into <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſome few books of
thoſe ſix hundred great volumes, taken by
<hi>Don Juan de Auſtria,</hi> at the battel of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto,</hi>
from the great Turk, which now
lye in the great Library of the magnifick
palace of the <hi>Eſcurial,</hi> ſome ſeven leagues
Weſtward from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and otherwayes
called <hi>San lorenço el real.</hi> Of thoſe and
many other mental abilities of that nature, he
gave after that moſt excellent proofs, both at
<hi>Rome, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That moſt learned Latine book in <hi>folio,</hi>
Treating of all the Mathematical Arts and
Sciences, which was written by that <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
gentleman <hi>Sempil,</hi> reſident in <hi>Madrid,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that <hi>Scotiſh</hi> ſpirits can produce good
fruits, even in hot climates.</p>
            <p>Another named <hi>Gordon,</hi> of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Nation likewiſe, wrote a great <hi>Latin</hi> book in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115875:112"/>
               <hi>folio,</hi> of <hi>Chronology,</hi> which is exceeding uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for ſuch as in a ſhort time would attaine
to the knowledge of many hiſtories.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Gordon</hi> alſo beyond ſea, penned
ſeveral books of divinity in an excellent ſtile
of Latin. Of which kinde of books, but
more profoundly couched, another <hi>Scot</hi>
named <hi>Turneboll,</hi> wrote a great many.
Theſe four eminent <hi>Scots</hi> I have put together,
becauſe they were ſocietaries by the name of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> ſome whereof
are living as yet; and none of thoſe that
are not, dyed above fourteen yeers ago.</p>
            <p>Methinks I were to blame, ſhould I in this
nomenclature leave out <hi>Dempſter,</hi> who for
his learning was famous over all <hi>Italy,</hi> had
made a learned addition to <hi>Roſſinus,</hi> and
written ſeveral other excellent books in <hi>Lat in;</hi>
amongſt which, that which doth moſt highly
recommend him to poſterity, is the work
which he penned of five thouſand illuſtrious
<hi>Scots,</hi> the laſt liver whereof (as is related in
the 64. <hi>page</hi> of this book) dyed above fifty
yeers ſince; for which, together with the other
good parts wherewith he was endowed, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was truly illuſtrious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Balfour,</hi> a profeſſor of Philoſophy in <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi>
wrote an excellent book in <hi>Latine</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115875:113"/>
the morals: ſo did another of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
Nation, named <hi>Donaldſon,</hi> upon the ſame
very ſubject and that very accurately. <hi>Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe</hi>
a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> man, who was a preacher in
French at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
one of the three that preached in the
<hi>French</hi> Church at <hi>London,</hi> wrote ſeveral
good books both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French.</hi>
Doctor <hi>Liddel</hi> penned an exquiſite book of
Phyſick, and ſo did Doctor <hi>William Gordon;</hi>
and both in the Latine tongue: which two
Doctors were for their learning renownedover
all <hi>Germany. Pontaeus</hi> a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> man, though
bred moſt of his time in <hi>France,</hi> by ſeveral
writings of his obvious to the curious Reader,
gave no ſmall teſtimony of his learning.</p>
            <p>There was a profeſſor of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
within theſe ſixteen yeers in <hi>Somure,</hi> who
ſpoke <hi>Greek</hi> with as great eaſe, as ever <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
did Latine; and could have expreſſed
himſelf in it as well, and as promptly, as in
any other Language: yet the moſt of the
<hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation never having aſtricked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo much to the propriety of words, as
to the knowledge of things, where there was
one preceptor of Languages amongſt them,
there were above forty profeſſors of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy:
nay, to ſo high a pitch did the glory of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115875:113"/>
the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation attaine over all the parts
of <hi>France,</hi> and for ſo long time together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in that obtained hight, by vertue of an
aſcendant the <hi>French</hi> conceived the <hi>Scots</hi> to
have above all Nations, in matter of their
ſubtlety in Philoſophical diſceptations, that
there hath not been till of late, for theſe ſeveral
ages together, any Lord, Gentleman, or other
in all that Country, who being deſirous to
have his ſon inſtructed in the principles of
Philoſophy, would intruſt him to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of any other, then a <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Maſter; of
whom they were no leſs proud then <hi>Philip</hi> was
of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Tullius</hi> of <hi>Cratippus.</hi> And
if it occurred (as very often it did) that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to a place in any <hi>French</hi> Univerſity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his tenderer yeers been ſubferulary to
ſome other kind of ſchooling, ſhould enter in
competition with another aiming at the ſame
charge and dignity, whoſe learning flowed
from a <hi>Caledonian</hi> ſource commonly the firſt
was rejected, and the other preferred: edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of youth in all grounds of literature,
under teachers of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> nation, being then
held by all the inhabitants of <hi>France,</hi> to have
been attended <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> with greater
proficiency, then any other manner of bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſubordinate to the documents of thoſe of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115875:114"/>
another Country. Nor are the <hi>French</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men have harboured this good opinion of
the Scots, in behalf of their inward abilitles;
but many times the <hi>Spaniards, Italians,
Flemins, Dutch, Hungarians, Sweds,</hi> and
<hi>Polonians,</hi> have teſtified their being of the
ſame mind, by the promotions whereunto, for
their learning, they in all thoſe Nations, at
ſeveral times have attained.</p>
            <p>Here nevertheleſs it is to be underſtood, that
neither theſe diſperſedly-preferred <hi>Scots,</hi> were
all of one and the ſame Religion, nor yet any
one of them a Presbyterian. Some of them
were, and are as yet Popiſh Prelates, ſuch as
the Biſhop of <hi>Vezon,</hi> and <hi>Chalmers</hi> Biſhop
of <hi>Neems,</hi> and <hi>Signor Georgio Con</hi> (who
wrote likewiſe ſome books in Latine) was by
his intimacy with <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban's</hi> Nephew <hi>Don
Franceſco Don Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Don Tadaeo
Barbarini,</hi> and for his endeavoring to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the Catholico-pontificial intereſt in great
Britain, to have been dignified with a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
hat, which (by all appearance) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after his departure from <hi>London,</hi> he
would have obtained as ſoon as he had come
to <hi>Rome,</hi> had death not prevented him by
the way in the City of <hi>Genua:</hi> but had he
returned to this Iſland with it, I doubt it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115875:114"/>
would have proved ere now as fatal to him, as
another ſuch like cap in <hi>Queen Maries</hi>
time had done to his compatriot <hi>Cardinal
Betoun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this as it is perceivable that all <hi>Scots</hi> are
not Presbyterians, nor yet all <hi>Scots</hi> Papiſts:
ſo would not I have the reputation of any
learned man of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
in oblivion, becauſe of his being of this
or this, or that, or you, or of that other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
no more then if we ſhould ceaſe to
give learning and moral vertues their due, in
the behalfe of pregnant and good ſpirits
born and bred in ſeveral climates; which to
withhold from them (whether <hi>Periſians, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroſcians</hi>
or <hi>Amphiſcians,</hi> would prove
very abſurd to the humane ingenuity or inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
humanity of a true <hi>Coſmopolite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For we ſee how the various aſpect of the
heavens, in their <hi>aſteriſtick</hi> and <hi>planetary</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
according to the diverſity of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
ſituations, diſpoſeth the inclinations of
the earths reſpective inhabitants differently;
whence (as is ſaid in the 56. <hi>page</hi> of this
book) <hi>The Spaniards are proud, the French
inconſtant, the Italians laſcivious,</hi> &amp;c. and
every Nation almoſt in their humour, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcrepant from one another, but each ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115875:115"/>
ſome diſorderly motion, which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath not, makes the other to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with ſome irregularity which the former
wants.</p>
            <p>We know the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are more penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then the high-<hi>Germans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and they more
intemperate then the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who againe
are more lecherous then the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> Now
ſeeing <hi>ex malis moribus bonae oriuntur le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and that vices, like diſeaſes of the body,
muſt be cured by contraries, it will cleerly
follow, there being vices contrary to other, as
well as vice to vertue, that the Laws curbing
thoſes vices in the oppoſite extreams, muſt
needs be very diſſonant from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Do not we ſee that in <hi>Holland</hi> to play the
Merchant is accounted honorable, although
it be thought diſgraceful in high-<hi>Germany,</hi>
for a gentleman to uſe anykind of traffick? The
Spaniard holds him worſe then a beaſt, that is
at any time drunk; yet the <hi>Dutch</hi>-man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems
him no good fellow, that ſometimes is
not. The <hi>Hollander</hi> deems him unworthy of
the name of man, that fornicates before he
marry; but the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hardly doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
him a <hi>Man,</hi> who hath not exerciſed thoſe
male-abilities whereby he is diſtinguiſhed from
the <hi>woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:115875:115"/>
Thus, according to the <hi>Genius</hi> of each cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
ſtatutes, acts, and ordinances being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
for the regulating of mens actions; and
our obedience to ſuperior powers by cuſtome
becomming (as it were) natural, we by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
finde, that the Religion wherewith men
are moſt accuſtomed, lyes beſt to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
            <p>For that it is ſo, we know by the vehemency
of fidimplicitaries, of whom ſome will chuſe
to loſe their lives before they quit their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
although they be altogether ignorant of
what they ſhould believe till they ask the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;
whoſe cuſtome (to make their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
ſubſervient to their choler) is to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
them with the negative faith, without
any great poſitive doctrine (for ſo begins the
Covenant) of which kind of zealous diſciples
was that covenanting gentleman, who burnt
a great many hiſtorical and Philoſophical
books, thinking they had been books of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;
he taking them to be ſuch, becauſe of
the red letters he ſaw in their titles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we need to think it ſtrange, that
in the world there are ſo many ſeveral Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if we conſider that the divers tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our bodies alter our inclinations,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115875:116"/>
from whoſe diſparity ariſe repugnant laws,
which long obedience makes it ſeem a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to violate. In my opinion, truly, there
is nothing more natural then variety yea, and
that ſometimes with oppoſition. Are not we
compoſed of the four elements, which have
their contrary as wel as ſymbolizing qualities?
and doth not the manner of their mixture, and
the degrees (by more or leſs) of the qualities
from thence flowing in the conſtitution of mens
bodies, diſagree in all the perſons of the world?
Hence ſome are Melancholious, ſome Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,
ſome Cholerick, and ſome Sanguine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
and every one of thoſe more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the humour that affects him in its
quantity and quality.</p>
            <p>Thus if men were left to themſelves, every one
would have a ſeveral religion; but ſeeing to reap
good from one another, we muſt to one another
apply our ſelves; &amp; that this application with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conformity, would prove deſtructive; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it that the individuals of mankinde have
been ſtill pleaſed to forego ſome natural inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
they had in peculiar differences, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to erect an uniformity in their ſociety, for
that ſelf-preſervation, which is the chief end of
their deſignes.</p>
            <p>This making either a King or State, we come
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115875:116"/>
then to have laws impoſed on us according to
the climate or diſpoſition of the people. And
although I know there be a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt
divine and humane inſtitutions, and
that it is fitting wicked thoughts be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
as well as words or actions: Yet do I
appeal to the judgement of any that will (in
caſting his eye upon the world, as it is and ſtill
hath been) conſider but the various govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the regulating of the deeds of the
conſciences of men; if he finde it not to be
true, that over the whole univerſe, amongſt
the Chriſtians, Jews, Paynims, and Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
both in this and former ages, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
almoſt have been ſtill diſtinguiſhed by
ſecular ſoveraignties, each State having its
own profeſſion, and the faith of one climate
being incompatible with that of another; and
yet in the duties commonly obſerved 'twixt
neighbor and neighbor in matter of buying
and ſelling, trucking, changing, and ſuch like
ſociable commutations, there is as great
unanimity by the moſt part of the world,
maintained even in the bonds of honeſty, as
if (as they know what pleaſeth God, ſhould
pleaſe them) they were of the opinion of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marlain,</hi>
who believed, that God was beſt
pleaſed with diverſity of Religions, variety of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115875:117"/>
worſhip, diſſentaneouſneſs of faith, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiformity
of devotion.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe preſcinding from the Religion
of any of my compatriots, which if diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to God, will no doubt at laſt diſpleaſe
themſelves, and hurry upon them that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which we ought not to aggravate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its time, by detaining from them what
praiſe to them is due for the natural and moral
accompliſhments wherewith God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
them for our benefit; for in praiſing
them, we praiſe God, who hath made them the
inſtruments of doing us good.</p>
            <p>Theſe three profound and univerſal ſcholars
of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, <hi>Tyry</hi> of the houſe of
<hi>Drumkilbo, Mackbrek,</hi> and <hi>Broun,</hi> deſerve
a rank in this liſt of men of literature, as well
as <hi>Chiſum</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Vezon,</hi> and others
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith above mentioned, and for
whoſe praiſes I have already apologized.
<hi>Tyry</hi> wrote books of Divinity in a moſt acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſtraine; and being aſſiſtant to the general
of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> was the ſecond perſon of all
that vaſt Eccleſiaſtical republick, which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as far as to the outmoſt territories of all
the Chriſtian Kings and States of the whole
continent of the world: a higher place then
which amongſt them, no ſtranger ever attained
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115875:117"/>
to in <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the place of their ſuprem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
juriſdiction. <hi>Mackbrek</hi> is eminent for
his literature in <hi>Pole,</hi> and <hi>Broun</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
and both of them authors of good
books.</p>
            <p>To hit upon the names of others ſuch as
theſe of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, renowned for
learning even in remoter parts of the world, it
would be a task not ſo proper for any, as for
the great traveler <hi>Lithco,</hi> a compatriot like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
of theirs, who in nineteen yeers ſpace
traveled three times by land over all the
known parts almoſt of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and
<hi>Africk,</hi> as by a book of a pretty bulk in
<hi>quarto</hi> ſet forth by himſelf, is more evidently
made manifeſt: the ſaid <hi>Lithco</hi> alſo is an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of ſeveral other books; and ſo was <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Graham</hi> a great traveler and very good
ſcholar, as doth appear by many books of his
emiſſion; but being otherwayes too licentious,
and given over to all manner of debordings, the
moſt of the praiſe I will give him, wil be to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him, in theſe terms of <hi>Ariſtotle: Nullum
magnum ingenium ſine mixtura de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some other eminent men for literature of
the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, beſides thoſe formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed,
have been much eſteemed of abroad,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115875:118"/>
although they were no <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi>
ſuch as <hi>Doctor John Forbas,</hi> who was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
of Divinity in <hi>Leyden,</hi> and wrote an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
book of Divinity in <hi>folio,</hi> called <hi>Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.
Doctor Read</hi> likewiſe was an able ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
as may appear by his book of <hi>Anatomy,</hi>
and other learned writtings.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing I am from beyond ſea bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the enumeration of my ſcholars home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
I cannot forget the names of <hi>Doctor
Baleanquel, Doctor Sibbalds, Doctor Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi>
and <hi>Doctor Michel,</hi> all able Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
and ſometimes beneficed men in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much the proteſtant ſaith oweth to
<hi>Doctor Robert Baron</hi> for his learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
(againſt <hi>Turnebol</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite) de objecto
formali fidei,</hi> I leave to be judged by thoſe
that have peruſed them. To the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Doctor William Leſly</hi> (who is one of the
moſt profound and univerſal ſcholars now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
his friends and acquaintance of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature
are very much beholding, but to any
books of his emiſſion, nothing at all; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
every one that knoweth him, wondreth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly:
and truly ſo they may; for though
ſcripturiency be a fault in feeble pens, and
that <hi>Socrates</hi> the moſt learned man of his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115875:118"/>
time ſet forth no works: yet can none of theſe
two reaſons excuſe his not evulging ſomewhat
to the publike view, becauſe he is known to
have an able pen, whoſe draughts would
grace the paper with impreſſions of ineſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
worth: nor is the example of <hi>Socrates</hi>
able to a pologize for him, unleſs he had ſuch
diſciples as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who having
ſepoſited in their braines the ſcientifick trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of their maſters knowledge, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(in their own works) communicate
them to the utility of future generations: yet
that this <hi>Caledonian Socrates</hi> (though wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
could not of late have been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of his talent, did proceed from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs
dealings of ſome wicked <hi>Anites, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi>
and <hi>Melits</hi> of the Covenant; the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of whoſe perverſe zeal, will keep the effects
of his vertue ſtill at under, till by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſome honeſt <hi>Lyſias,</hi> the authority of
the land be pleaſed to reſeat him into his
former condition, with all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that ought to attend ſo prime a
man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctor John Gordon</hi> ſometime Miniſter of
<hi>Elgin, Doctor William Hogſtoun,</hi> and
<hi>Doctor James Sibbet,</hi> are men who have
given great proof of their learning, as well by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115875:119"/>
Treatiſes which they have divulged, as in all
manner of <hi>Academical</hi> exercitations. <hi>Doctor
William Guild</hi> deſerveth by himſelf to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
both for that he hath committed
to the preſs many good books tending to the
edification of the ſoul, and bettering of the
minde; and that of all the Divines that have
lived in <hi>Scotland</hi> theſe hundred yeers, he hath
been the moſt charitable, and who beſtowed
moſt of his own to publike uſes. The loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his heart dilates it ſelf to many, and
the center of his deſires is the Common weal:
in matter of great edifices, where he builds not,
he repaires; and many Churches, Hoſpitals,
Colledges and Bridges, have been the objects
of his beneficence. But to ſhew the vertue of
this man beyond thouſands of others richer
then he, even of thoſe that had a nearer
and more immediate call to the performance
of ſuch charitable offices, when he was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
of the old Colledge of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and
that at a time, when, by reaſon of the ſword
everywhere raging through the land, all
ſchooles almoſt were laid waſte; ſo great was
his induſtry, ſo prudent his government, and ſo
liberal his erogations, that the number of the
ſcholars there, all the time that he ruled, did
by threeſcore and ten a yeer, exceed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115875:119"/>
confluence that ever was therein ſince the
foundation of that Univerſity; to which I wiſh
all happineſs, becauſe of him for whom this
book is intended, who learned there the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Philoſophy, under the conduct
of one <hi>Maſter William Seaton,</hi> who was
his tutor; a very able preacher truly, and
good ſcholar, and whom I would extoll yet
higher, but that being under the conſiſtorian
laſh, ſome critick Presbyters may do him
injury, by pretending his diſlike of them, for
being praiſed by him, who idolizeth not their
authority.</p>
            <p>The ſame reaſon invites me not to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the praiſes of <hi>Maſter William Lawder</hi>
preacher at <hi>Ava,</hi> a good Divine, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Poet, both in Latine and Engliſh. And
for the ſame cauſe muſt I forbear to ſpend <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comions</hi>
upon that worthy Gentleman <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
David Leech,</hi> who is a moſt fluent Poet
in the Latine tongue, an exquiſite Philoſopher
and profound <hi>Theolog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing I am come to ſpeak againe of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>
Poets, which have flouriſhed of late, the
foreſaid <hi>Maſter Leech</hi> hath an elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
named <hi>John,</hi> who hath ſet forth four or
five moſt excellent books of Epigrams and
Eclogues in the Latine Tongue. One <hi>Maſter
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115875:120"/>
Andrew Ramſey</hi> likewiſe hath been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of books of very good Epigrams in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.
Several others in that Nation are and
have been of late very good Latine Poets;
amongſt which I muſt needs commemorate
<hi>Doctor Arthur Jhonſtoun,</hi> a Phyſician by
profeſſion, yet ſuch a one as had been ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imbued by the ſprings of <hi>Helieon,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was full three and twenty yeers of age,
he was laureated Poet at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that
moſt deſervedly, as may appear by his <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
his <hi>Paraphraſtick tranſlation of the
Pſalmes,</hi> (wherein if he excell not, I am ſure
he equaleth <hi>Buchanan)</hi> and ſome other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes
by name to me unknown.</p>
            <p>His brother alſo <hi>Doctor William Jhonſtoun</hi>
was a good Poet in Latine, and a good <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,</hi>
acknowledged to be ſuch (which
was none of his meaneſt praiſes) by <hi>Maſter
Robert Gordon</hi> of <hi>Straloch,</hi> one of the ableſt
men of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the <hi>Mathematical</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and who, of all <hi>Mathematicians,</hi>
hath done it moſt honor, by having taken the
paines to ſet down all the Shires and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
thereof in moſt exact <hi>Geographical</hi>
Maps; which deſigne though intended, eſſayed,
and blocked by many others, yet was never
brought to its full and compleat perfection,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115875:120"/>
but by this gentleman of the name of <hi>Gordon,</hi>
intituled the Laird of <hi>Straloch;</hi> who being
loath his vertue and learning ſhould expire
with himſelf, hath the moſt hopeful and beſt
educated children of any whoſoever within
two hundred miles of his houſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Mathematical blades put me in mind of
that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Liddel</hi> (of whom, for his abilities in
Phyſick, I made mention in <hi>p.</hi> 186. which I had
reaſon to do, becauſe of his learned books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in Latin, <hi>de Diaeta, de febribus,</hi> &amp; <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodo
Medicinae)</hi> who for his profoundneſs in
theſe Siences of ſenſible immaterial objects, was
everywhere much renowned, eſpecially at
<hi>Francfort de maine, Francfort on the oder,</hi>
and <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> where he was almoſt as well
known, as the Monſtrous <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Tun,
that ſtood thre in his time. He was an eminent
profeſſor of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> a diſciple of
the moſt excellent <hi>Aſtronomer,</hi> Tycho Brahe,
and condiſciple of that worthy <hi>Longomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus:</hi>
yet in imitation of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (whoſe
doctrine with great proficiency he had imbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
eſteeming more of truth then of either <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
or <hi>Plato,</hi> when the new Star began
to appear in the conſtellation of <hi>Caſsiopeia,</hi>
there was concerning it ſuch an interſhocking
of opinions, betwixt <hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> and <hi>Doctor
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115875:121"/>
Liddel,</hi> evulged in print to the open
view of the world, that the underſtanding
<hi>Reader</hi> could not but have commended both
for all, and yet (in giving each his due) praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Tycho Brahe</hi> moſt for <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> and
<hi>Liddel</hi> for his knowledge above him in all the
other parts of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>As this <hi>Doctor Liddel</hi> was a gallant <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,</hi>
and exquiſite <hi>Phyſician;</hi> ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous to propagate learning to future
ages, and to make his own kindred the more
enamoured of the ſweetneſs thereof, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Mathematical Sciences, he bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
fourty pounds Engliſh money a yeer, to
the new Colledge of the Univerſity of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi>
for the maintenance of a <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
profeſſor; with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of his own kinſemen <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi>
ſhould be preferred before any other. This any
rational man would think reaſonable; nor was
it truly much controverted for the ſpace of
fourteen or fifteen yeers together, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the Legacy; at which time his Nephew
on the brothers ſide being a childe, and but
then initiated to the rude elements of Latine,
one <hi>Doctor William Jhonſtoun</hi> was preferred
to the place, becauſe there was none, at that
time, of <hi>Doctor Liddels</hi> conſanguinity
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115875:121"/>
able to diſcharge it: a reaſon verily relevant
enough.</p>
            <p>But by your leave, good <hi>Reader,</hi> when
<hi>Doctor William Jhonſtoun</hi> dyed, and that
<hi>Doctor Liddels</hi> Nephew, <hi>Maſter Duncan
Liddel</hi> by name, was then of that maturity
of Age, and provection of skil in moſt of the
diſciplines Mathematical, as was ſufficient for
the exerciſe of that duty, and the meriting of
his uncles benefice; did the good men rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at the helme there, make any conſcience of
the honeſt <hi>Doctors</hi> latter will? no, forſooth;
the oracle muſt be firſt conſulted with: The
Miniſterian <hi>Philoplutaries</hi> (my tongue forks
it, I have miſtaken it ſeems one word for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I ſhould have ſaid <hi>Philoſophers)</hi> thought
fit otherwayes to diſpoſe thereof; for, ſay
they, <hi>Maſter Duncan Liddel</hi> hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the hainous ſin of fornication, and begot
a young Laſs with childe, therefore his uncles
Teſtament muſt be made voide, in what relates
to his enjoyment of that dotation. O brave
Logick, and curious commentary upon a later
Will for the better explication of the mind of
the defunct! Which Presbyterian doctrine, had
it bin in requeſt in the daies of <hi>Socrates,</hi> what
fine paſs would the world have been brought
to ever ſince that time, by that ignorance
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115875:122"/>
which ſhould have over-clouded us, through
our being deſtitute of the works of <hi>Plato,
Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Euclid,</hi> with all the Scholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts
that have gloſſed on them theſe two
thouſand yeers paſt; for, by all appearance,
thoſe three prime <hi>Grecians</hi> would have been
forced in their younger yeers to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to ſome other profeſſion then Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
for want of a maſter to inſtruct them in
the principles thereof; for the Presbytery of
<hi>Athens</hi> (no doubt) would have pearched up
poor <hi>Socrates</hi> upon a penitentiary Pew, and
outed him of his place, for having two wives
at once (neither whereof, whether <hi>Xantippe,</hi> or
<hi>Myrto,</hi> was either ſo handſome or good as
<hi>Maſter Liddels</hi> concubine) and in lieu of that
treſpaſſer, ſupplyed the <hi>Academical</hi> chaire
with the breech of a more ſanctified brother,
whoſe zealous <hi>jobernoliſme</hi> would never have
affected the <hi>Antipresbyterian</hi> ſpirits of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Euclid,</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> nor gained to his
ſchoole any diſciples, who ſhould have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from ſuch a muddy fountain to derive any
clear ſprings of learning to after-ages, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
poſterity with any other kind of literate
works, then ſuch as the pretended holy men
(and accuſers of <hi>Socrates) Anitus, Lycon,</hi>
and <hi>Melitus</hi> by name, did ſet forth; which to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115875:122"/>
the eyes of both body and minde, have ever
ſince their time, been of the colour of the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Vandomes</hi> cloak, <hi>inviſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if one durſt make bold to ſpeak to
thoſe great profeſſors of piety, I would adviſe
them out of the <hi>Evangile,</hi> to take the beam
out of their own eye, before they meddle with
the moat that is in their neighbors; and to
conſider, that the ſin of theft which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
in robbing <hi>Maſter Liddel</hi> of his due,
is a far more hainous tranſgreſſion, then that
ſingle fornication; for which, beſides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of what was mortified to him, he was
by them for a long time together moſt rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
perſecuted.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think their fault can be better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated,
then by fulfilling the contents of the
legacy, and inveſting <hi>Liddal</hi> in his own right;
which that I may ſeem to avouch with the
better ground of reaſon, I dare almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelf, that there is not any within the
Iſle of <hi>Britain,</hi> with whom (taking in all the
<hi>Mathematical</hi> Arts and Sciences together,
<hi>practical</hi> and <hi>theoretick)</hi> he will not be well
pleaſed (upon occaſion) to adventure a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
for ſuperiority in the moſt, and that with
a willingneſs to forego and renounce any
claim, title, or priviledge he can, or may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115875:123"/>
to for the chaire of Mathematical profeſſor
in new <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> in caſe of non-prevalency.</p>
            <p>This is more (ſome will ſay) then his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
doth promiſe, and that to look to him, one
would not think he had ſuch abilities. What
then? do not we ſee in <hi>Apothecaries</hi> ſhops,
pots of the ſame worth and faſhion containe
drugs of a different, value, and ſometimes the
moſt precious oyntment put in the courſeſt
box? ſo may a little and plaine man in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhape incloſe a minde high and ſublime
enough; a giant like ſpirit in a low ſtature,
being able to overtop a <hi>Coloſſus</hi> with <hi>Pyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maean</hi>
endowments.</p>
            <p>But were there no other <hi>Remora</hi> or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
to retard his intended progreſs in
Mathematical deſignes, the inward qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his minde to the advancement of thoſe
Sciences, would quickly raiſe his perſon to a
greater eſtimation: yet truly as he is in <hi>London</hi>
for the preſent, I can no better compare him,
then to an <hi>Automatary</hi> engine, wherein there
are many ſeveral ſprings, reſorts and wheels,
which though when once put into a motion,
would produce moſt admirable effects, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
forced, for want of a convenient
Agent to give them the due brangle, to lye im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobile,
and without efficacy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:115875:123"/>
Such an Agent is a <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> a <hi>Patron,</hi> a
promover of learning, a favorer of the Muſes,
and protector of Sholars: in the production of
which kind of worthy men, were this land
a lone but a little more fertil, not only great
<hi>Britain,</hi> but the whole world beſides would
be the better for it.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation as of
late have been famous for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poeſie, the
firſt that occurs, is <hi>Sir William Alexander,</hi>
afterwards created <hi>Earle of Sterlin:</hi> he made
an inſertion to Sir <hi>Philip Sidneys Arcadia,</hi>
and compoſed ſeveral Tragedies, Comedies,
and other kind of Poems which are extant in
a book of his in <hi>folio,</hi> intituled <hi>Sterlins
works.</hi> The purity of this Gentlemans vein
was quite ſpoiled by the corruptneſs of his
courtierſhip; and ſo much the greater pity;
for by all appearance, had he been contented
with that mediocrity of fortune he was born
unto, and not aſpired to thoſe grandeurs of
the Court, which could not without pride be
proſecuted, nor maintained without covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
he might have made a far better account
of himſelf. It did not ſatisfie his ambition to
have a laurel from the <hi>Muſes,</hi> and be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a King amongſt Poets, but he muſt be
King of ſome new-found-land; and like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115875:124"/>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> indeed, ſearching after new
worlds, have the ſoveraignty of <hi>Nova Scotia.</hi>
He was born a Poet, and aimed to be a King;
therefore would he have his royal title from
<hi>King James,</hi> who was born a King, and
aimed to be a Poet. Had the ſtopped there, it
had been well: but the flame of his honour
muſt have ſome oyle wherewith to nouriſh it.
Like another <hi>King Arthur,</hi> he muſt have his
Knights, though nothing limited to ſo ſmall a
number: for how many ſoever that could have
looked out but for one day like gentlemen, and
given him but one hundred and fifty pounds
<hi>Sterlin</hi> (without any need of a key<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or opening
the gate to enter through the Temple of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
which in former times was the only way
to honour) they had a ſcale from him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to aſcend unto the platformes of Vertue;
which they treading underfoot, did ſlight the
ordinary paſſages, and to take the more ſudden
poſſeſſion of the Temple of honour, went up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
obſcure by-paths of their own, towards
ſome ſecret <hi>Angiports</hi> and dark poſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors,
which were ſo narrow, that few of
them could get in, till they had left all their
gallantry behind them; yet ſuch being their
reſolution, that in they would, and be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful
upon any tearms, they miſregarded all
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115875:124"/>
formerly-uſed ſteps of promotion, accounting
them but unneceſſary; and moſt rudely ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in unto the very Sanctuary, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
hung out the Orange colours, to teſtifie
their conqueſt of the honour of Knight-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet.</p>
            <p>Their King nevertheleſs, not to ſtaine his
Royal dignity, or to ſeem to merit the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſelling honor to his ſubjects, did for
their money give them land, and that in ſo
ample a meaſure, that every one of his Knight-Baronets
had for his hundred &amp; fifty pounds
<hi>Sterlin</hi> heritably diſponed unto him ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
good and ſufficient Acres of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi>
ground, which being but at the rate of ſix pence
an Acre, could not be thought very dear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how prettily in the reſpective parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of diſpoſition they were bounded and
deſigned fruitful corne-land, watered with
pleaſant rivers, running alongſt moſt excellent
and ſpacious Meadows; nor did there want
abundance of Oaken groves in the midſt of
very fertil plaines (for if they wanted any
thing, it was the Scrivener or Writers fault;
for he gave order, as ſoon as he received the
three thouſand Scots marks, that there ſhould
be no defect of quantity or quality, in meaſure
or goodneſs of land) and here and there
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115875:125"/>
moſt delicious gardens and orchards, with
whatever elſe could in matter of delightful-ground,
beſt content their fancies; as if they
had made purchaſe amongſt them of the
<hi>Elyſian fieldes,</hi> or <hi>Mahumets Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this manner my Lord <hi>Sterlin</hi> for a
while was very noble; &amp; according to the rate
of <hi>Sterlin</hi> money, was as twelve other Lords
in the matter of that frankneſs of diſpoſition,
which not permitting him to dodge it upon
inches &amp; ells, better and worſe, made him not
ſtand to give to each of his champions terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
of the beſt and the moſt: and although
there ſhould have happened a thouſand Acres
more to be put in the Charter or writing of
diſpoſition then was agreed upon at firſt;
he cared not; half a piece to the Clerk was
able to make him diſpenſe with that. But at
laſt, when he had inrolled ſome two or three
hundred Knights, who, for their hundred and
fifty peeces each, had purchaſed amongſt them
ſeveral millions of <hi>Neocaledonian</hi> Acres, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to them and theirs for ever, under the
great ſeal, the affixing whereof was to coſt
each of them but thirty peeces more, finding
that the ſociety was not like to become any
more numerous, and that the ancient gentry
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115875:125"/>
of <hi>Scotland</hi> eſteemed of ſuch a whimſical dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
as of a diſparagement rather then additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their former honor, he bethought himſelf
of a courſe more profitable for himſelf, and
the future eſtabliſhment of his own ſtate; in
proſecuting whereof, without the advice of his
Knights (who repreſented both his Houſes of
Parliament, Clergy and all) like an abſolute
King indeed, diſponed heritably to the <hi>French,</hi>
for a matter of five or ſix thouſand pounds
<hi>Engliſh</hi> money, both the dominion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the whole continent of that kingdom
of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> leaving the new Baronets
to ſearch for land amongſt the <hi>Selenits</hi> in the
Moon, or turn Knights of the Sun: ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have they bought their Orange Riban,
which (all circumſtances conſidered) is and
will be no more honorable to them or their
poſterity, then it is or hath been profitable to
either.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid here, is not by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
but to very good purpoſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the ſubject in hand; for as armes
and arts commonly are paralleled, and that
<hi>Pallas</hi> goes armes with a Helmet, I held it
expedient, leſt the liſt of the Scholars ſet down
in this place, ſhould in matter of preeminence
be too far over-peered by the roll of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115875:126"/>
above recited, that my Lord <hi>Sterlin</hi>
ſhould here repreſent the place of a King for
the literatory part, as well as there did the
great uncircumciſed <hi>Garne</hi> for the military;
and bring <hi>nova Scotia</hi> in competition with
<hi>Bucharia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this Lord <hi>Alexander, Drummon</hi>
and <hi>Wiſhart</hi> have publiſhed very good Poems
in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Nor is Maſter <hi>Ogilvy</hi> to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
whoſe tranſlation of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and of the

            <p>I might have named ſome more <hi>Scotiſh</hi>

beſides (as I often told) I intend not to make
a compleat enumeration of all, there is a Latin
book extant, which paſſeth by the name of
<hi>Deliciae poetarum Scotorum,</hi> wherein the
<hi>Reader</hi> may finde many (even of thoſe that
have lived of late yeers) whom I have here
ommitted; as I have done ſeveral other able
men of the Scotiſh Nation in other faculties,
ſuch as Maſter <hi>David Chalmers,</hi> who in <hi>Italy</hi>
penned a very good book, and that in neat
<hi>Latine,</hi> treating of the Antiquities of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:115875:126"/>
and had it printed at <hi>Paris:</hi> as alſo
one <hi>Simſon,</hi> who wrote in Latine four ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
books of <hi>Hieroglyphicks:</hi> and one
<hi>Hart</hi> in the City of <hi>London</hi> at this

&amp;c.</p>
            <p>The excellency of Doctor <hi>William Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
in Alchymy above all the men now living
in the world, whereof by his wonderful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
he giveth daily proof, although his
learned books publiſhed in the Latine tongue
did not evidence it, meriteth well to have his
name recorded in this place: and after him,
Doctor <hi>Leeth</hi> (though in time before him)
deſigned in <hi>Paris,</hi> where he lived by the name
of <hi>Letu;</hi> who, as in the practiſe and theory
of Medicine he excelled all the Doctors of
<hi>France,</hi> ſo in teſtimony of the approbation
he had for his exquiſiteneſs in that faculty, he
left behinde him the greateſt eſtate of any of
that profeſſion then; as the vaſt means poſſeſt
by his ſons and daughters there as yet, can
teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe eminent Doctors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
I ought not to forget Doctor <hi>Fraſer;</hi>
who was made Doctor at <hi>Toulouſe,</hi>
with the univerſal approbation and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe
of that famous Univerſity; and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115875:127"/>
afterwards ſucceeded to Doctor <hi>Arthur
Jhonſtoun</hi>'s place of Phyſician in ordinary to
the late King. There is another <hi>Scotiſh</hi> gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
likewiſe, of the name of <hi>Wallace</hi> (in
<hi>France</hi> called <hi>Devalois)</hi> who enjoyeth (and
hath ſo done theſe many yeers) the dignity of
a prime counſellor of the Parlament of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,</hi>
the capital City of the Province of
<hi>Dauphiné;</hi> and is withal the chief favourite
and the only truſtee of the <hi>grand Mareſhal

            </p>
            <p>Now as in this Heterogenean miſcellany we

proper ſignifications enter in competition)
hath been no leſs ſubject to poverty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
than any of the former two) have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hint at ſome of our late Scotiſh Divines;
the firſt whereof, and that <hi>prioritate digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi>
that to my memory preſenteth himſelf,
is Doctor <hi>William Forbas,</hi> principal once of
the Colledge of <hi>New Aberdeen,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made Biſhop of <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> who was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115875:127"/>
ſo able a ſcholar, that ſince the daies of <hi>Scotus
ſubtiles,</hi> there was never any that profeſſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Divinity</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that
in either of thoſe faculties did parallel him. He
left Manuſcripts of great learning behind him,
which as I am informed were bought at a
good rate by Doctor <hi>Laud</hi> late Archbiſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and primate of <hi>England;</hi>
Whoſe ſpiritual brother <hi>Spotteſwood,</hi> late
Archbiſhop of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was likewiſe endowed with
a great deal of learning; by means whereof
although he wrote many good books, yet that
wherein he beſtowed moſt pains, was a large
book in <hi>folio,</hi> intituled <hi>The hiſtory of the
Church of Scotland;</hi> which I believe was
never printed: yet the Manuſcript thereof,
written with <hi>Spotteſwod</hi>'s own hand, I ſaw
preſented at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> in the Lobby betwixt
the little gallery and Privy Chamber, now
called the Admiralty Court, by <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
late Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> to the late King, who
even then delivered it to his Secretary of State
for <hi>Scotland, William</hi> Earl of <hi>Lanerick</hi> by
name, who was the ſame <hi>Duke Hamiltouu</hi>
of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> that was killed at <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
and only brother to <hi>James</hi> Duke by the ſame
aforeſaid title, who two yeers before that, loſt
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115875:128"/>
his head at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the Palace-yard:
but what became of that Manuſcript after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
I cannot tell; but this I know, that
the tenderer thereof (upon his knees to his late
Majeſty, as the gift of a deceaſed man; for
the Author dyed but the very day before)
Maſter <hi>John Maxwel</hi> by name, was a very
learned man, and Author of ſome good books.
Yet leſt the Readers humour ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with the mentioning of theſe three
malignant prelates, I muſt afford him for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
another Trinity of a contraryoperation,
all in one doſe, the ingredients wherof are <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,
Gilleſpick,</hi> and <hi>Rutherford;</hi> named
<hi>Alexander, George,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> all Maſters
truly, and have been ſo to my knowledge theſe
twelve yeers paſt; which three have been or
are (for the firſt two of them are dead) very
able and learned men; whoſe books never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
(for they were all Authors) I will in
ſome things no otherwayes commend, then
<hi>Andraeas Rivetus</hi> profeſſor of <hi>Leyden,</hi> did
the doctrine of <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox;</hi> whoſe
raſhneſs (in apologizing for them) he aſcribed
<hi>prae fervido Scotorum ingenio, &amp; ad auden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
prompto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, and without flattery be it ſpoken,
(for I believe none that knows me, will twit
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115875:128"/>
me with that vice) the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi>
hath, beſides thoſe I have here nominated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
ſeveral excellent ſpirits (and that of late
too) whoſe abilities by the Presbyterian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
and the indigence it hath brought
upon them, have been quite ſmothered, and
hid as a candle under a buſhel.</p>
            <p>Many learned books, written in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
for want of able and skillful Printers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſaries requiſite for works of ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
undertaking, have periſhed; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
after they are ready for the preſs (if the
Author in the interim happen to dy) the wife
and children (for the moſt part) like rats and
mice (that preferr the cheſt where the bread
and cheeſe is kept, to the coffer wherein is the
ſilver and gold) to ſave a little money, make
uſe of the aforeſaid papers (without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the precious things contained in them)
to fold perhaps their butter and cheeſe into, or
to other leſs honorable employments. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
a thing it is, that either good ſpirits
ſhould be ſtruck with penury, or that their
writings ſhould fall into the hands of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</p>
            <p>That poverty is an enemy to the exerciſe of
vertue, and that <hi>non facile emergunt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
virtutibus obſtat res anguſta domi,</hi>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:115875:129"/>
is not unknown to any acquainted with <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy,</hi>
or the ſoveraign power of mony: but
if the great men of the land would be pleaſed
to ſalve that ſore (which poſſibly would
not be ſo expenſive to them as either their
hawks or hounds) then peradventure would
theſe ingenious blades ſing out aloud, and
cheerfully, with <hi>Martial, Sunt Mecaenates
non deerunt flacce Marones;</hi> and it might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
probably be, and that in a ſhort ſpace, that,
by ſuch gallant incitements (through a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
emulation who ſhould moſt excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<hi>Scotland</hi> would produce, for Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
Aſtronomy, Natural Magick, Poeſie,
and other ſuch like faculties, as able men as
ever were <hi>Duns-Scotus, Sacroboſcus, Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldus
Scotus,</hi> and other compatriots of
theſe three <hi>Scots,</hi> whoſe names I would not
inſert in the roll of the reſt, becauſe they flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed
before the yeer 1600.</p>
            <p>Now as I have not mentioned any <hi>Scotiſh</hi>
man to praiſe him for eminent actions done
by him, either in the field or ſchoole, preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the yeer 1600. (which if I had had a
minde to do, I would not have omitted the
naming of the ſeveral Conſtables of <hi>France,</hi>
Admirals, and Generals of Armies, that have
been of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation in the French ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115875:129"/>
neither would I have forgot the high
and honorable employments the <hi>Scots</hi> had of
<hi>Charlemaine</hi> the firſt occidental Emperor, nor
the great exploits performed by the <hi>Scots</hi>
under the conduct of <hi>Godfrey de Bullion</hi> in
the Conqueſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and afterwards
under his ſucceſſors in the kingdoms of <hi>Syria,
Antiochia,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> againſt the <hi>Saracens;</hi>
nor what was done by the <hi>Scots</hi> in defence of
the territories of <hi>Spaine</hi> againſt the <hi>Moores</hi>
and <hi>Aethiopians:</hi> as alſo, I would have ſpoken
a little of the Dukes of <hi>Chaſteau le roy,</hi> and
Dukes of <hi>Aubigny</hi> that were <hi>Scots;</hi> and
of <hi>Count Betun,</hi> and <hi>Count de Mongome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
who killed the King of <hi>France</hi> in tilting)
ſo is it, that of all thoſe I have named, whether
for Milice or Literature (ſo far ſhort I have
faln in the number of the whole) that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath the greateſt part of them all been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but hardly
have both the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> of that country,
produced the fifth part of them: Such a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Seminary hath that otherwayes obſcure
climate of the world, proved in the affording
of excellent ſpirits both ſor armes and arts.
Whether what I have related here of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
and Scholars of the Scotiſh Nation that
have been famous abroad, be not for uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115875:130"/>
truths received in other countries, by
thoſe that have been eye-witneſſes to their
actions, I appeal to Sir <hi>Oliver Fleemin,</hi>
maſter of the Ceremonies, and to Maſter
<hi>Dury;</hi> who, as they are both men of good
judgement, and have been travelers in other
States and Kingdoms; ſo am I certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that they cannot be altogether eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from the report of the good reputation of
thoſe their compatriots in the places through
which they paſſed: which I believe the rather,
for that moſt of them do know Sir <hi>Oliver
Fleemin</hi> to be a man of excellent good parts,
wiſe in counſel, experienced in affaires of State,
true to his truſt, and in ſix or ſeven of the
chief Languages of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> the ableſt,
livelieſt, and moſt pertinent ſpokes-man of this
age: and that alſo they are not ignorant of
the moſt eminent endowments wherewith
Maſter <hi>John Dury</hi> (in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
where his learning is highly extolled, intituled
<hi>Duraeus)</hi> hath his minde qualified and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed:
in Reaſon he is ſtrongly principled,
and alloweth prudence to be a directreſs of his
actions: he doth not ſubordinate his faith to
the affaires of the world, although it agree not
with his faith to gaineſtand an eſtabliſhed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
he holds it more lawful to yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115875:130"/>
to a power ſet up above us, then, to
the hazard of the ruine of a Country, to erect
another; he loveth an honeſt peace, and the
wayes that tend to it; and with thankfulneſs
payeth the favours of protection: he reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceth
the all-ſeeing providence in the change
of government; and where it commandeth,
there he yeelds Allegiance. But if the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
would have a more genuine Character of
his worth, and that which ſhall repreſent him
with a greater livelineſs, his beſt courſe will be
to have recourſe to the peruſal of the ſeveral
Treatiſes compoſed by him, whereof he hath
emitted good ſtore.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all I have written in praiſe
of Sir <hi>Oliver Fleemin,</hi> and Maſter <hi>John
Dury,</hi> I would expatiate my pen a little more
at large upon this <hi>encomiaſtick</hi> ſtraine, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of them both, but that I hope ere long to
extoll them againe by way of duty, when
they ſhall be pleaſed out of their love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to Sir <hi>Thomas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rquhart</hi> (who is the
only man for whom this book is intended; for
whether he be the <hi>Author,</hi> or ſome other
that is but a friend or ſervant of his, it is not
material, ſeeing the furtherance of his weal,
and credit of his country, is the meer ſcope
thereof, and end whereat it buts) to interpone
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115875:131"/>
their favour with the members of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Councel of State (ſeeing they are
the only two of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation, that as
yet have any kind of intimacy with either of
theſe high Courts) and ſecond him in his juſt
demands, to the obtaining of what in this
Tractate is deſired in his name. And although
nothing of thoſe kinde of good offices hath
by them hitherto been performed to him, leſt
perhaps their offering to open their mouth for
any in whom there was ſuſpicion of malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
might breed diſlike and diminution of
truſt; yet muſt I needs deſire them now to
lay aſide thoſe needleſs fears, and groundleſs
apprehenſions, and like real friends indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir
themſelves to do that Gentleman a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
which cannot chuſe (though <hi>per impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi>
he were unthankful) but carry along with
it, like all other actions of vertue, its own
remuneration and reward: and if by miſchance
(which I hope ſhall not occur) their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in ſollicitation procure a reprehenſory
check, then let them lay the blame upon this
page, which I ſhall take upon my ſhoulder,
and bear the burthen of all; there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
there. But that, <hi>Amicus certus in
re incerta cernitur,</hi> was a ſaying of King
<hi>James,</hi> of whom to make no mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115875:131"/>
the literate men of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Nation,
that have flouriſhed ſince 1600. would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
in me no leſs debility of memory, then
<hi>Maſſala Corvinus</hi> was ſubject to, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
his own name: for beſides that he was
a King, hiſtory can hardly afford us amongſt
all the kings that ever were <hi>(Solomon</hi> and
<hi>Alfonſo</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> being laid aſide) any
one that was neer ſo learned as he: as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
by that book <hi>in folio,</hi> intituled <hi>King
James his works,</hi> and ſeveral other learned
Treatiſes of his, which in that book are not
contained.</p>
            <p>In this liſt of armes and arts-men, King
<hi>James</hi> obtaines a rank amongſt the Scholars;
becauſe the ſouldiery did repute him no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
of their faculty. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> is placed
laſt, as in a Parliamentary proceſſion, and
bringeth up the reer, as <hi>General Ruven</hi> Leads
on the Van: for as <hi>Ruven</hi> was ſuch a meer
ſouldier, that he could neither read nor write;
ſo <hi>King James</hi> was ſuch a meer ſcholar, that
he could neither fight by ſea nor land. He
thought <hi>James the peaceable</hi> a more Royal
ſtile, then <hi>William the Conqueror;</hi> and
would not have changed his Motto of <hi>Beati
pacifici</hi> for the title of <hi>Sylla felix,</hi> although
it had been accompanyed with the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115875:132"/>
a thouſand <hi>Mariuſes;</hi> yet in his dayes
were the <hi>Scots</hi> in good repute, and their
gallantry over almoſt all countries did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it.</p>
            <p>Then was it that the name of a <hi>Scot</hi> was
honorable over all the world, and that the
glory of their anceſtors was a paſs-port and
ſafe-conduct ſufficient for any traveler of that
country. In confirmation whereof, I have
heard it related of him, who is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
of his diſcourſe, and to whoſe weal it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated,
that after his peragration of <hi>France,
Spaine;</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and that for ſpeaking
ſome of thoſe languages with the livelineſs of
the country accent; they would have had
him paſs for a Native, he plainly told them
(without making bones thereof) that truly
he thought he had as much honour by
his own country, which did contrevalue the
riches and fertility of thoſe Nations, by the
valour, learning, and honeſty, wherein it did
parallel, if not ſurpaſs them. Which aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his was with pregnant reaſons ſo well
backed by him, that he was not much gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
therein by any in all thoſe kingdoms. But
ſhould he offer now to ſtand upon ſuch high
terms, and enter the liſts with a ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
it fears me that in ſtead of Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115875:132"/>
and panegyricks, which formerly he
uſed, he would be conſtrained to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to vindications and apologies: The
toyle whereof, in ſaying one and the ſame
thing over and over again, with the misfortune
of being the leſs believed the more they ſpoke,
hath proved of late almoſt inſupportable to
the favourers of that Nation, whoſe inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
in forraign peregrinations, muſt now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
in their greateſt difficulties, depend
upon the meer ſtock of their own merit, with
an abatement of more then the half of its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
by reaſon of the national imputation:
whilſt in former times, men of meaner endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would in ſharper extremities, at the
hands of ſtranger-people, have carryed
thorow with more ſpecious advantages, by the
only vertue of the credit and good name of the
country in general; Which, by twice as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
abilities as ever were in that land, both for
martial proweſs, and favour of the Muſes, in
the perſons of private men, can never in the
opinion of neighbour-States and Kingdoms,
be raiſed to ſo great a hight, as publick oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy
hath depreſt it. For as that City whoſe
common treaſure is well ſtored with money,
though all its burgers ſeverally be but poor, is
better able to maintaine its reputation, then
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115875:133"/>
that other, all whoſe Citizens are rich, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a conſiderable bank, the experience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hiſtory gives us, in the deduction of the
wars betwixt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genois:</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo will a man of indifferent qualifications,
the fame of whoſe country remaineth unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
obtaine a more amicable admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the ſocieties of moſt men, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thrice more accompliſhed parts, that is
the native of a ſoyle of an opprobrious name;
which although, after mature examination, it
ſhould ſeem not to deſerve, yet upon the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perieſt
ground that is of honor queſtioned, a
very ſcandal once emitted, will both touch and
ſtick.</p>
            <p>This maintaining of the reputation of the
<hi>Scots</hi> in theſe latter dayes, hath at ſeveral
times, in forraign countries, occaſioned ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing
of the ſingle combate, againſt ſuch
inconſiderate blabs, as readily upon any ſmall
(though groundleſs) miſreport are prodigal
of reproaches, and caſt aſperſions on men of
the moſt immaculate carriage: many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
hereof I could produce; but to avoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity,
I will refer the manifeſtation of the
truth thereof to the teſtimony of Captain <hi>John
Mercer,</hi> whom I might have nominated for
his excellency in the ſword, with Sir <hi>John
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115875:133"/>
Hume</hi> of <hi>Eatoun,</hi> and <hi>Francis Sinclair</hi>
but that in a treatiſe of this nature, where the
ſubjected matter doth not all at once preſent it
ſelf to the memory, to place each one in order
as he comes, is <hi>methodo doctrinae</hi> nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the true ſeries of the purpoſe in
hand.</p>
            <p>What aſcendant he hath over others at the
ſingle rapeer, hath been many times very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
expreſſed by my Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and
the late Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and (as I am infomed)
by this ſame Earl of <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> beſides di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others, who have been eye-witneſſes to the
various proofs, he hath given of his exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the art of defence; amonſt whom Sir
<hi>John Carnegy,</hi> and Sir <hi>David Cuningham,</hi>
are beſt able to relate, what with their own
eyes they ſaw him do at <hi>Angiers,</hi> a City in
<hi>France,</hi> where, after many exaſperating
provocations, he at laſt, to vindicate both his
own fame, and that of his Native country, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew,
in the preſence of ſundry gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Ladies, one of the moſt renowned
for the faculty of eſcrime, that was in all that
Kingdom. Some ſuch trials are reported to
have been undergone by him here in <hi>England,</hi>
with ſo much applauſe, and deſerved appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115875:134"/>
as from the mouths of men very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in that gladiatory profeſſion, hath extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(out of their ſincerity of heart) an unfain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
commendation of being the beſt ſword-man
of the Iſle of great <hi>Britain;</hi> Which I ſay,
not to diſparage any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation;
for that I know there are in it as truly valou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
men, as any one breathing in the world:
and of as good conduct for the improving of
their courage, and making it effectual againſt
their declared enemies; but that he hath ſome
ſecret puntilios in the exerciſe of the ſingle
ſword-fight, by purſuing all manner of wards
with falſifying, binding, and battering of the
ſword, after a faſhion of his own, with all
due obſervance of time and diſtance; by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding,
in caſe the adverſary after a <hi>finda,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and <hi>volting</hi> the body: to alonge a ſtoccade
<hi>coupee au ventre les deux pieds en ſautant,</hi>
and other ſuch excellent feats, which the
judgement conceiving, and the eye perceiving,
the hand and foot, by vertue of a conſtant
practiſe, execute with an incredible nimbleneſs
and agility; to the perfection whereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a martially-diſpoſed gentleman do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attaine, it can no more derogate from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115875:134"/>
his eminency in Military employments, then
it doth eclipſe the credit of a commander in
chief of cavalry, not to make a well-managed
horſe to go ſo neatly <hi>terre a terre,</hi> the <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valar,</hi>
the <hi>ripolone,</hi> the <hi>paſſades,</hi> the <hi>corvetti,</hi>

and other ſuch like pleaſant aires, as
would a <hi>cavallerizo</hi> or maſter of the noble

which many beſids this Capt. <hi>Mercer,</hi>
(whom now I will not nominate) have run

of the <hi>Scots,</hi> the nature nevertheleſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſpirits is (without any forecaſt of danger)
to proclaim the diſeaſe of ſome, to be a leproſie
cleaving to the body of the wholeNation.</p>
            <p>Which cuſtom truly, as it is diſapprovable, for
that the innocent do thereby ſuffer for the fault
of the guilty; ſo do I the more diſlike it, that
the gentleman who in this treatiſe is the moſt
concerned, when after that to my knowledge
he had received ſome favour with expectation
of greater ones, it no ſooner happened, by
his ſervants or ſome elſe, to be known of what
country he was, but immediately the effectual
courteſies formerly intended towards him, were
exchanged into meer ſuperficial complements,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115875:135"/>
and general civilities; with this aſſurance ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
that out of their reſpects to him, they
ſhould abſtaine, in all times comming, from
doing any injury to his compatriots: which
hope of preſervation of his country-men, upon
the baſis of his ſingle reputation, from the
danger of future prejudice, did afford him no
ſmall contentment, although the name of his
country, in matter of himſelf, did prove a very
diſmal obſtruction to the proſecuting of his
own good fortune: and to ſpeak ingenuouſly,
ſeeing it is the caſe of many good ſpirits and
worthy gentlemen beſides him, I could hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wiſh, as no man is anywhere praiſed for
his mothers being in ſuch or ſuch a place at
the inſtant of his birth, that alſo nowhere any
ſhould receive the leaſt detriment, either in his
means or eſtimation, for his parents reſidence
when he was born.</p>
            <p>Thoſe productions of meer chance, and
concomitances of what is totally out of the
reach of our power to command, were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by the wiſe and generous men of old, to
deſerve ſo little influence for procuring good

although a native of <hi>Scythia,</hi> which
was then a more ſavage country then at this
time it is, albeit now it be the ſeminary of a

wilder people then ever <hi>Scotland</hi> did bring

notwithſtanding his being a high-lander of

which overthrew the <hi>Turkiſh Bajazet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In imitation of which ſpecious and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
examples, that the State of this Iſle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard to Epheſtian or Exotick Country,
exterior concernements, adjuncts of fortune,
or any thing beyond the Sphere of our wills
activity, ſhould conſider of men according to
the fruits (whether good or bad, true or falſe)
of the ſeveral acts and habits reſpectively,
which, before the interior faculties by frequent
iteration were therewith affected, did at firſt
depend upon our own election, it is both my
deſire and expectation for that the gentleman,
whoſe intereſt I herebyintend to promove, doth
openly defie very calumny it ſelf to be able to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115875:136"/>
lay any thing to his charge, either for tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
covetouſneſs, or hypocriſie, the three
foule blots wherewith his country is ſtained
by thoſe, that, for the blemiſh of a few,
would aſperſe the whole, and upon all lay the
imputation of faults done but by ſome</p>
            <p>I dare ſwear with a ſafe conſcience, that he
ntver coveted the goods of any, nor is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of any more in matter of worldly means,
then the peaceable poſſeſſion of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
his own: he never put his hand to any
kinde of oath, nor thinks fit to tye his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the implicite injunctions of any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
tyranny. He never violated truſt; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
kept his parole; and accounted no
crime more deteſtable, then the breach of
faith. He never received money from King
nor Parliament, State nor Court; but in all
employments, whether preparatory to, or
executional in war, was ſtill his own pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
and had orders from himſelf. He
was neither in Duke <hi>Hamiltons</hi> engagement,
nor at the field of <hi>Dunbar:</hi> nor was he ever
forced, in all the ſeveral fights he hath been
in, to give ground to the enemy, before the
day of <hi>Worceſter</hi>-battel. To be masked
with the vaile of hypocriſie, he reputes abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
and groſs diſſimulation to contraſt
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115875:136"/>
the ingenuity of a free-born ſpirit. All flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
ſmoothing and flinching for by-ends, he
utterly diſliketh, and thinks no better of adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
aſſentations, then of a <hi>Gnatonick</hi> ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophantizing,
or paraſitical cogging: he loves to
be open-hearted, and of an explicite diſcourſe,
chuſing rather by ſuch means to ſpeak what
is true, to the advantage of the good, then
to conceal wickedneſs under a counterfeit
garb of devotion.</p>
            <p>By vertue of which liberty, though rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
aſſumed by him, and never exceeding
the limits of prudential preſcription, he in a
little book lately publiſhed, of the genealogy
of his houſe, had (after the manner of his
predeceſſors, who for diſtinction ſake were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
entituled by appellative deſignations)
his proper name affected with the agnominal
addition of the word <hi>parreſiaſtes,</hi> which
ſignifieth one that ſpeaks honeſtly with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
not but that above all things he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
of ſecrecy in the managing of affaires
of moment, and holdeth the life of all great
buſineſſes to conſiſt in the cloſeneſs of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
whilſt they are in agitation; but as a
woman ſhould not ſit with her face masked, in
the company of her friends at dinner, nor a
man keep himſelf alwaies skulking behinde
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115875:137"/>
a buckler, where there is no apearance of a foe;
ſo ſhould the affectedneſs of a ſervil ſilence
utterly be exploded, when veracity of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
is the more commendable quality.</p>
            <p>This bound he never yet tranſgreſſed; and
ſtill purpoſeth to be faithful to his truſt. I am
not now to diſpute the mutual relation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and obedience; and how far, to the
power God hath placed above us (in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> we are bound to ſuceumb.
Thoſe that are throughly acquainted with him
know his inclinations, both that he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
nothing contrary to his conſcience,
that he will regulate his conſcience by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of a well-grounded faith, and true dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of reaſon, and that to the utmoſt of his
power he will perform whatever he promiſeth.
As for thoſe that know him not, and yet
would in the cenſure of him as liberally criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize
it, as if they were his cardiognoſts, and
fully verſed in his intentions; if they be not
men in whom he is concerned, as having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
above him, he will never vex his brain,
nor toyle his pen, to couch a fancy, or beſtow
one drop of inke upon them for their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
It doth ſuffice him, that the main
ground of all his proceedings, is honeſty; that
he endeavoreth the proſecuting of juſt ends by
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115875:137"/>
upright means: and ſeeing the events of things
are not in the power of man, he voluntarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth
unto providence the over-ruling
of the reſt: he hath no prejudicate principles,
nor will he be wedded to ſelf-opinions.</p>
            <p>And yet (as I conceive it) he believeth, that
there is no government (whether Eccleſiaſtical
or Civil) upon earth, that is <hi>jure divino,</hi> if
that divine right be taken in a ſenſe ſecluding
all other forms of government (ſave it alone)
from the priviledge of that title; thoſe <hi>piae
fraudes</hi> and political whimſies being obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon tender conſciences, to no other end,
but that, without expenſe of war, theymight be
plyable in their obedience to the injunctions
of the Vice-gerents of the Law, meerly by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring
them from acting any thing contrary to
the will of the primitive Legiſlator, for fear
of Celeſtial puniſhment.</p>
            <p>As for Pacts and Covenants, it is my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he thinks they are no further obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
(and conſequently being annihilated, no
more to be mentioned much leſs urged) when
the ground whereupon they were built, or
cauſe for which they were taken, are not in
vigour to have any more influence upon the
contracters: for <hi>idem eſt non eſſe &amp; non

            <p>I am confident the conſiſtorian party will be
ſo ill pleaſed with the freedom of this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that they will account him a malignant
or a ſectary that hath penned it; therefore (in
my conceit) to uſe their cavilling <hi>idiom,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
and independent wil better ſympathize
with one another, then either of them with the
Presbyter; whoſe principles how conſiſtent they
are with Monarchy, or any other kind of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
ſoveraignty, let any many judge that
is verſed in the ſtory of <hi>Geneva,</hi> the civil wars
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and hiſtory of queen
<hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland;</hi> although what hath been
done by the Kirkiſts theſe laſt dozen of yeers,
had been altogether buryed in oblivion,
that nothing had been known of their una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
oppoſition by the Presbyterian armies
at <hi>Dunſlaw, Newburne, Marſton-moor,</hi> and
<hi>Hereford</hi> to the late Kings deſignes, crowned
by his own impriſonment at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and
<hi>Holmby;</hi> and that after proclaiming <hi>Charles
the ſecond,</hi> at the marker-croſs of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
king of the three Realms of <hi>England,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> that they had

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115875:138"/>
               <hi>Montroſe,</hi> had been utterly forgotten.</p>
            <p>What gallant Subjects theſe Presbyterians
have been, are for the preſent, and will prove
in times coming, to any kinde of Secular
power, you may perceive by King <hi>James</hi>
his <gap reason="foreign">

being in all its genders (and that at all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions)
as infectious as ever was the <hi>Baſilisk</hi>'s
ſight to the eye of man.</p>
            <p>For of a King they onely make uſe, for
their own ends; and ſo they will of any other
Supreme Magiſtracie, that is not of their own
erection. Their Kings are but as the Kings
of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> whom the <hi>Ephors</hi> preſumed
to fine, for any ſmall offence: or as the Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-Kings,
which, after children have trimmed
with bits of Taffata, and ends of Silver-lace,
and ſet them upon Wainſcoat Cupboards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Marmalade and Sugar-cakes, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſpoſed of (even by thoſe that did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
ſo much reſpect unto them) for a two-peny
Cuſtard, a pound of Figs, or meſs of
Cream.</p>
            <p>Verily, I think they make uſe of Kings in
their Conſiſtorian State, as we do of Card-kings
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115875:139"/>
in playing at the Hundred; any one
whereof, if there be appearance of a better
game without him, and that the exchange of
him for another incoming Card is like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
more for drawing of the ſtake) is by
good gameſters without any ceremony diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded:
Or as the French on the <hi>Epiphany</hi>-day
uſe their <hi>Roy de la <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ebve,</hi> or king of the
bean; whom, after they have honoured with
drinking of his Health, and ſhouting aloud,
<hi>Le Roy boit, le Roy boit,</hi> they make pay
for all the reckoning; not leaving him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one peny, rather then that the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie
of their deboſh ſhould not be ſatisfied
to the full. They may be likewiſe ſaid to uſe
their King, as the players at Nine-pins do the
middle Kyle, which they call the king; at
whoſe fall alone they aim, the ſooner to obtain
the gaining of their prize: or as about Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats
we do the King of Miſrule; whom we
inveſt with that title to no other end, but to
countenance the <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Riots and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous
diſorders of the family, where he is
inſtalled.</p>
            <p>The truth of all this, appears by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
to <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond; whom they
crowned their King at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and who,
(though he be, for comelineſs of perſon, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115875:139"/>
affability, mercy, piety, cloſeneſs of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
veracity, foreſight, knowledge, and other
vertues both Moral and Intellectual, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inferiour to any of his hundred and ten
predeceſſors) had nevertheleſs no more rule
in effect over the Presbyterian Senate of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
then any of the ſix foreſaid mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
had above thoſe by whom they were
dignified with the ſplendour of Royal
pomp.</p>
            <p>That it is ſo, I appeal to the courſe taken
by them, for aſſiſting him whom they called
their King, againſt them whom I muſt confeſs
they hate more then him: for, admitting of
none to have any charge in State, Church, or
Army, but ſuch as had ſworn to the eternity
of the Covenant, and inerrability of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
See, leſt otherwiſe, like <hi>Achan</hi>'s
wedge, they ſhould bring a judgement upon
the Land; ſome Lords, and many others ſo
principled, after that by their King they had
been intruſted with Commiſſions to levie Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of both Horſe and Foot, together
with other Officers ſubordinate to them, did,
under pretext of making the King a glorious
King, and the Covenant to triumph at the
gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> with a <hi>pſeudo-ſanctimonial</hi>
trick of zeal, <hi>Legerdemain</hi>-ſubtilty, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115875:140"/>
performing the admirable feats of making a
little weak man, unfit for Military ſervice, a
tall, ſtrong, and warlike champion, and that
onely by the ſweet Charm of laying twenty
Rexdolars upon his head and ſhoulders; as
alſo by the Arch-angelical inchantment of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
double Angels, had the skill to make an
Iriſh hobbie, or Galloway-nag, as ſufficient
for their Field-fight, as any Spaniſh Genet, or
Naples courſer.</p>
            <p>In proſecution of which wonderful exploits,
ſome of them approved themſelves ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
Alchymiſts, that many of both the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
and Infantry, with their Arms, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,

            <p>Were thoſe Kirk-men free from covetouſneſs

no leſs deeply plunged then any Laick in the

claim to the fifth part of all the rents of the

Noble-men of their rights of Patronages,

not ſo much for any treſpaſs they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

and that, according to their talk of

ſuch matters, might in ſome meaſure
ſeem excuſable; becauſe an unfeigned zeal to
the furtherance of Learning, Piety, and good
works, ſhould be ſeconded with power and
wealth: but that for a meer aerial diſcourſe
of thoſe, whoſe hearts are ingulphed in the

from their own means and dignities to enrich
the wives and children of hypocrites, is a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſin before God (contrary to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s
admonition, who accounteth men infidels that
do ſo) and the abuſing of thoſe benefits he

            <p>Is there any more common ſaying over all
<hi>Scotland</hi> in the mouthes of the Laicks, then
that the Miniſter is the greedieſt man in the

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115875:142"/>
That by their daily practice, both ſeverally

whereof himſelf is patron, Maſter <hi>Gilbert
Anderſon,</hi> Maſter <hi>Robert Williamſon,</hi> and
Maſter <hi>Charles Pape</hi> by name, ſerving the
Cures of <hi>Cromarty, Kirkmichel,</hi> and <hi>Culli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cudden)</hi>
having done what lay in them, for
the furtherance of their owne covetous ends,
to his utter undoing: for the firſt of thoſe three,
(for no other cauſe, but that the ſaid <hi>Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
would not authorize the ſtanding of a
certain Pew (in that Country called a desk) in
the Church of <hi>Cromarty,</hi> put in without his
conſent, by a profeſſed enemy to his Houſe,
who had plotted the ruine thereof; and one
that had no Land in the pariſh) did ſo rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him and his family in the Pulpit at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, both before his face, and in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and with ſuch opprobrious termes,
more like a ſcolding <hi>Tripe-ſellers</hi> wife, then
good Miniſter, ſquirting the poyſon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and abominable falſhood (unfit for
the chaire of verity) in the eares of his tenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
who were the onely auditors, did moſt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115875:143"/>
ingrately and deſpightfully ſo calumniate and
revile their Maſter, his own patron and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
that the ſcandalous and reproachful
words ſtriving which of them ſhould firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
againſt him its ſteel-pointed dart,
did, oftentimes, like cluſters of hemlock, or
wormewood dipt in vinegar, ſtick in his
throat; he being almoſt ready to choak with
the aconital bitterneſs and venom thereof,
till the razor of extream paſſion, by cutting
them into articulate ſounds; and very rage it
ſelf, in the higheſt degree, by procuring a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
had made him ſpue them out of his
mouth, into rude indigeſted lumps, like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
toads and vipers that had burſt their gall.</p>
            <p>As for the other two, notwithſtanding that
they had been borne, and their Fathers before
them, vaſſals to his houſe, and the predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
of one of them had ſhelter in that Land, by
reaſon of ſlaughter committed by him, when
there was no refuge for him anywhere elſe in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and that the other had never been
admitted to any Church, had it not been for
the favour of his foreſaid patron, who, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the will of his owne friends, and great
reluctancy of the miniſtry it ſelf, was both the
nominater and chuſer of him to that function;
and that before his admiſſion, he did faithfully
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115875:144"/>
proteſt he ſhould all the days of his life remain
contented with that competency of portion
the late incumbent in that charge did enjoy
before him: they nevertheleſs behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſo peeviſhly and unthankfully towards
their forenamed patron and Maſter, that, by
vertue of an unjuſt decree both procured and
purchaſed from a promiſcous knot of men
like themſelves, they uſed all their utmoſt
endeavours, in abſence of their above-recited
Patron (to whom and unto whoſe houſe they
they had been ſo much beholding) to out-law
him, and declare him rebel (by open procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
at the market-croſs of the head Town
of his owne ſhire) in caſe he did not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to the grant of that augmentation of
ſtipend, which they demanded, conforme to
the tenour of the above-mentioned decree; the
injuſtice whereof will appeare, when exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by any rational judge.</p>
            <p>Now the beſt is, when by ſome moderate
Gentlemen it was expoſtulated, why againſt
their Maſter, Patron, and benefactor, they
ſhould have dealt with ſuch ſeverity and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
contrary to all reaſon and equity;
their anſwer was, They were inforced and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
ſo to do, by the ſynodal and presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
conventions of the Kirk, under paine of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115875:144"/>
deprivation, and expulſion from their benefices:
I will not ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but may
ſafely think that a well-ſanctified mother will
not have a ſo ill-inſtructed brat, and that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria
humana</hi> cannot be the lawfull daughter
of a <hi>jure divino</hi> parent.</p>
            <p>Yet have I heard him, notwithſtanding
all theſe wrongs, ſeveral times avouch, that
from his heart he honoureth the miniſterial
function, and could wiſh that each of them
had a competency of livelihood, to the end that
for not lacking what is neceſſary for him, he
might not be diſtracted from the ſeriouſneſs of
his ſpeculative imploiments, with which above
all things he would have one buſied, that were
admitted to that charge; and to be a man of a
choice integrity of life, and approved literature:
he alwayes eſteeming Philoſophy, in all its
Mathematical, natural, and prudential de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
rules, and precepts, ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for inbelliſhing the minde of him whoſe
vocation it is, to be ſequeſtred from the toil of
worldly affairs; that the Reaſon and Will of
man being thereby illuminated, and directed
towards the objects of truth and goodneſs, a
Church-man or pretender to divinity regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of thoſe ſciences, might be juſtly ſuſpected
to be ignorant of God, by caring ſo little for
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115875:145"/>
the knowledge of his creatures, and upon a
ſacred text oftentimes to make an unhallowed
comment.</p>
            <p>I have heard him likewiſe ſay, he would
be glad, that in every Pariſh of <hi>Scotland</hi>
there were a free Schoole and a ſtanding Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
in the cuſtody of the Miniſter; with this
proviſo, that none of the books ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezeled
by him, or any of his ſucceſſors; and
he impowered to perſwade his pariſhioners, in
all he could, to be liberal in their dotations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the School, and magnifying of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary:
To the end that beſides the good would
thereby redound to all good Spirits, it might
prove a great encouragement to the <hi>Stationer</hi>
and <hi>Printer;</hi> that, being the nobleſt profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongſt Merchants; and this, amongſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers.</p>
            <p>As alſo to intreat the Civil Magiſtrate,
by the ſeverity of the Law, to curb the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of ſuch notorious and ſcandalous ſinners
as ſhould prove unpliable to the ſtamp of his
wholeſome admonitions.</p>
            <p>As for his wife and children, if he follow the
footſteps of <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp; ask ſincerely for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God before he wed, he will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
endow him with wealth ſufficient for
both; for whoever marieth, if he be wiſe,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115875:145"/>
will either have a vertuous or a monyed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to his mariage-bed; by means of either
whereof, the diſcretion and foreſight of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
husband, will provide a dowry for
her, and education for her iſſue; which, in a
well-policied Country, is better then a patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>The taking of this courſe, will advance
learning, further piety, improve all moral
vertues eſtabliſh true honour in the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make
trades flouriſh, merchandiſe proſper, the yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry
induſtrious, Gentlemen happy, and the
miniſters themſelves richer then when their
mindes were totally bent on the purchaſe of
money: for, as patterns of godlineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moroſity, and literature without affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(being men qualified as aforeſaid) by
their ſweetneſs of converſation, and influence
of doctrine, they would gaine ſo much ground
upon the hearts of their acquaintance, that
Country-men would not onely gratifie them
dayly, and load them with variety of preſents,
but would alſo after their deceaſe rather chuſe
to ſtarve themſelves, then ſuffer the wives and
children of perſons ſo obliging, to be in any
want or indigence: ſpecially if the traffick
and civility of <hi>Scotland</hi> were promoved by a
cloſe union with <hi>England,</hi> not heterogeneal
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115875:146"/>
(as timber and ſtone upon ice ſtick ſometimes
together) bound by the froſt of a conquering
Sword; but homogeneated by naturalization,
and the mutual enjoyment of the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
&amp; immunities; which deſign being once
by King <hi>James</hi> ſet abroach, although ſome of
his compatriot ſubjects, out of ambition to be
called rather profound Scholars and nimble
wits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then good Country-men and loyal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
did pertinaciouſly withſtand the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing a wedge of Wainſcot is fitteſt
and moſt proper for cleaving of an oaken tree,
and that Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> othewiſe deſigned
by the titles of Lord <hi>Verulam,</hi> and Viſcount
Saint <hi>Albans,</hi> was pleaſed to make a ſpeech
thereupon in the Honorable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
in the fifth year of King <hi>James</hi> his raign
in this Dominion; it is the humble deſire of the
Author, that the States of this Iſle vouchſafe
to take notice of his reaſons (he being both
a wiſe man and a good Engliſh man) after the
manner as followeth.</p>
            <p>He begins his diſcourſe thus:</p>
            <q>
               <p>IT may pleaſe you, Maſter Speaker, preface
will I uſe none, but put my ſelf upon your
good opinions to which I have been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115875:146"/>
beyond my deſervings; neither will I
hold you in ſuſpenſe what way I will chuſe,
but now at the firſt declare my ſelf, that I
mean to counſel the Houſe to naturalize
the nation of <hi>Scotland;</hi> wherein neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I have a requeſt unto you, which is of
more efficacy to the purpoſe I have in hand,
then all that I ſhall ſay afterwards, and it
is the ſame requeſt which <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>
did more then once, in great cauſes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
make to the people of <hi>Athens,</hi> that
when they took into their hands the balls,
whereby to give their voices (according as
the manner of them was) they would raiſe
their thoughts, and lay aſide thoſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
which their private vocations and
degrees might miniſter and repreſent unto
them, and would take upon them cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and mindes agreable to the dignity
and honour of the eſtate.</p>
               <p>For, Maſter Speaker, as it was aptly
and ſharply ſaid by <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Parmenio,</hi>
when upon their recital of the great offers
which <hi>Darius</hi> made, <hi>Parmenio</hi> ſaid unto
him, I would accept theſe offers, were I as
<hi>Alexander,</hi> he turned it upon him again, ſo
would I (ſaith he) were I as <hi>Parmenio:</hi> So
in this cauſe, if an honeſt Engliſh merchant
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115875:147"/>
(I do not ſingle out that ſtate in diſgrace, for
this Iſland ever held it honorable, but onely
for an inſtance of private profeſſion) if an
Engliſh Merchant ſhould ſay, Surely I would
proceed no further in the union, were I as
the King, it might be reaſonably anſwered,
No more would the King, were he as an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Merchant: and the like may be ſaid of
a Gentleman in the Country, be he never ſo
worthy or ſufficient; or of a lawyer, be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo wiſe or learned; or of any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
condition in this Kingdome: for
certainly (Maſter Speaker) if a man ſhall
be onely or chiefly ſenſible of thoſe reſpects
which his particular affection and degree
ſhall ſuggeſt and infuſe into him, and not
enter into true and worthy conſiderations
of eſtate, we ſhall never be able aright to
give Counſel, or take Counſel, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for if this requeſt be granted, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the cauſe obtained.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Having begun his ſpeech after this manner, he
proceeds yet further; and firſt, he fully anſwers
all the arguments, concerning inconveniencies
that have been alledged to enſue, in caſe of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
way to this naturalization: next, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſeth
what greater inconveniencies would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
befal this Land, if they did not condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115875:147"/>
to the union: and laſtly, what gaine
and benefit would redound to <hi>England</hi> by
meanes thereof: all which he diſplayeth in
that learned ſpeech, with ſuch exquiſite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and impartial judgement, that, without
prejudicacie of opinion, and ſenſe-perverting
paſſion, there is nothing to be ſaid againſt
it.</p>
            <p>He reſteth not here, but in another paſſage
thereof, after his having acknowledged the
difference or diſparity betwixt the two Nations
in matter of external means, giving therein the
advantage to <hi>England,</hi> as the richer Country;
he expreſſeth himſelf in theſe words: <hi>Indeed it
muſt be confeſſed, that for the goods of the
mind and body, they are</hi> alteri nos: <hi>for, to do
them but right, we know in their capacity
and underſtandings, they are a People inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
in labour induſtrious, in courage va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
in body hard, active, and comely: more
might be ſaid, but in commending themwe,
do but in effect commend ourſelves; for they
are of one part and continent with us; and,
the truth is, we are participant both of their
vertues and vices,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He ſays furthermore, in illuſtration of the
inconveniences which <hi>England</hi> will incur, in
caſe of non-naturalizing the Scots, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115875:148"/>
ſeveral Kingdoms or Eſtates have
been united in Soveraignty, if that union
hath not been fortified and bound in with a
further union, and namely that which is
now in queſtion</hi> (of naturalization) <hi>this hath
followed, that at one time or other they
have broken, being upon all occaſions apt
to relapſe and revolt to the former ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Of this aſſertion the firſt example
that I will ſet before you, is of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
union which was between the</hi> Romans<hi>and the</hi> Latines, <hi>which continued from the
battel at the Lake of</hi> Regilla <hi>for many yeers,
until the Conſulſhip of</hi> Caius Plautius, <hi>and</hi>Lucius Aemilius Mammercus: <hi>at which time
there began, about this very point of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization,
that War which was called</hi>Bellum ſociale, <hi>being the moſt bloody and
pernicious War that ever the Romane State
endured; wherein, after numbers of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
and infinite Sieges and ſurpriſals of
Towns, the</hi> Romanes <hi>in the end prevailed,
and maſtered the</hi> Latines: <hi>And as they
had the honour of the War, ſo looking back
into what perdition and confuſion they were
neer to have been brought, they preſently
naturalized them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately thereafter, ſetting before our
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115875:148"/>
eyes the example of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the reſt of<hi>Peloponneſus</hi> their aſſociates, he ſaith thus:<hi>The State of</hi> Sparta <hi>was a nice and jealous
State of this point of imparting Naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
to their confederates: but what was
the iſſue of it? After they held them in a
kind of ſociety and amity for divers yeeres,
upon the firſt occaſion given, which was no
more then the ſurpriſal of the Caſtle of</hi>Thebes, <hi>by certain deſperate conſpirators in
the habit of maſters, there inſued forthwith
a general revolt and defection of their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates;
which was the ruine of their State,
never after to be recovered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame dicourſe he introduceth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
example, though of latter times, which is
this, that <hi>notwithſtanding the Kingdome of</hi>Aragon <hi>had in the perſons of</hi> Ferdinand <hi>and</hi>Iſabella <hi>been united with the reſt of</hi> Spain,<hi>and that it had ſo continued for many
years, yet becauſe it was ſevered and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the other Kingdoms of</hi> Spaine <hi>in
this point of naturalization, it fell out ſo,
that, long after that, upon the voice of a
condemned man, out of the grate of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
towards the ſtreet, that cryed</hi> Libertad,
libertad, <hi>there was raiſed a dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:115875:149"/>
which with great difficulty was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
with an army royal: after which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
nevertheleſs, to ſhun further inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
they were incorporated with</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,<hi>and the remanent regions of</hi> Spaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Piſa <hi>likewiſe being united unto</hi> Florence,<hi>without the benefit of naturalization, upon
the firſt ſight of</hi> Charls <hi>the eighth of</hi> France<hi>his expedition into</hi> Italy <hi>did revolt; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
it was reunited, and did obtain
the foreſaid benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little after, the better to perſwade the
Parliament to the ſaid Naturalization of the<hi>Scots,</hi> he ſubjoineth theſe words. <hi>On the
other part (Maſter Speaker) becauſe it is
true which the</hi> Logicians <hi>ſay</hi> Oppoſita juxta
ſe poſita clarius eluceſcunt; <hi>let us take a view,
and we ſhall find, that whereſoever King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
and States have been united<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
union incorporated by the bond of Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization
mutually, you ſhall never obſerve
them afterwards upon any occaſion of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or otherwiſe, to break and ſever again;
as we ſee moſt evidently before our eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
our Provinces of</hi> France; <hi>that is to ſay,</hi>Guyen Provence Normandy, Britain, <hi>which
notwithſtanding the infinite infeſting trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115875:149"/>
of that Kingdome, never offered to
break again. We ſee the like effect in all
the Kingdomes of</hi> Spain, <hi>which are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
naturalized; as</hi> Caſtile, Leon, Valeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Andaluzia, Granada, Murcia, Toledo,
Catalonia, <hi>and the reſt, except</hi> Aragon,<hi>which held the contrary courſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had the contrary ſucceſs: and laſtly,
we ſee the like effect in our Nation,
which never rent aſunder after it was
united; ſo as we now ſcarce know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the</hi> Heptarchy <hi>was a true ſtory, or a
fable: and therefore (Maſter Speaker)
when I revolve with my ſelf theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and others, ſo lively expreſſing the
neceſſity of a Naturalization, to avoid a
relapſe into a ſeparation, I muſt ſay, I do
believe (and I would be ſory to be found a
Prophet in it) that except we proceed with
this naturalization, though not perhaps in
his Majeſties time, who hath ſuch intereſt
in both Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in the mean time of his
deſcendents, theſe Realmes will be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
danger to divide and break again.
Now if any man be of that careleſs mind,</hi>Maneat noſtros ea cura nepotes; <hi>or of that
hard mind, to leave things to be tried by
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115875:150"/>
the ſharpeſt ſword: ſure I am, he is not of
Saint</hi> Pauls <hi>opinion, who affirmeth that
whoſoever uſeth not foreſight, and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his family, is worſe then an Infidel;
much more if we ſhall not uſe foreſight for
theſe two Kingdomes, that comprehend in
them ſo many families, but leave things
open to the peril of future diviſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo forth going on very efficaciouſly in
confirmation of the premiſes, he proceeds to
the benefits which ariſe to <hi>England</hi> by knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the knot ſurer and ſtraiter between theſe
two Realms, by communicating Naturalizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Scotland: his words are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The benefits may appeare to be two; the
one ſurety, the other greatneſs: touching
ſurety (Maſter Speaker) it was well ſaid by</hi>Titus Quintus <hi>the</hi> Romane, <hi>touching the
ſtate of</hi> Peloponneſus, <hi>that the tortoiſe is
ſafe within her ſhell,</hi> Teſtudo intertegumen
tuta eſt; <hi>but if there be any parts that lie
open, they endanger all the reſt. We know
well, that although the State at this time
be in a happy peace, yet for the time paſt,
the more ancient Enemy is</hi> the French, <hi>and
the more the late</hi> Spaniard; <hi>and both theſe
had as it were their ſeveral poſtern-gates,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115875:150"/>
whereby they might have approach and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
to annoy us:</hi> France <hi>had</hi> Scotland, <hi>and</hi>Spaine <hi>had</hi> Ireland; <hi>for theſe were but the
two acceſſes which did comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
both theſe Enemies to aſſaile and
trouble us: we ſee that of</hi> Scotland <hi>is cut
off by the union of theſe two Kingdomes, if
that it ſhall be made conſtant and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
that of</hi> Ireland <hi>is cut off likewiſe by
the convenient ſituation of the weſt of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>towards the north of</hi> Ireland, <hi>where
the ſore was, which we ſee being ſuddenly
cloſed by meanes of this ſalve; ſo that as
now there are no parts of the State expoſed
to danger to be a temptation to the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Forrainers, but their approaches and
avenues are taken away: for I do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
doubt, but theſe Forrainers, who had ſo
little ſucceſs when they had thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
will have much leſs comfort now,
that they be taken from them. And ſo
much for ſurety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on: <hi>For greatneſs (Maſter
Speaker) I think a man may ſpeak it ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without bravery, that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of</hi> England <hi>having</hi> Scotland <hi>united,</hi>Ireland <hi>reduced, and ſhipping maintained,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115875:151"/>
is one of the greateſt Monarchies, in forces
truely eſteemed, that hath been in the
world; for certainly the kingdoms here on
earth, have a reſemblance with the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven, which our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
not to any great kernel or nut, but
to a very ſmall graine, yet ſuch a one as is
apt to grow and ſpread; and ſuch do I take
to be the conſtitution of this kingdom, if
indeed our country be referred to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and power, and not quenched too much
with the conſideration of utility and wealth.
For (Maſter Speaker) was it not, think you,
a true anſwer that</hi> Solon <hi>of</hi> Greece <hi>made to
rich King</hi> Croeſus <hi>of</hi> Lydia, <hi>when he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him a great quantity of gold, that
he had gathered together, in oſtentation of
his greatneſs and might? but</hi> Solon <hi>ſaid to
him contrary to his expectation, Why, ſir, if
another come that hath better iron then
you, he will be Lord of all your gold. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the nation of</hi> Spaine, <hi>which of ancient

time ſerved many ages, firſt under</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,<hi>then under</hi> Rome, <hi>after under</hi> Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,

his ſpeech with this period, <hi>I have ſpoken
(Maſter Speaker) out of the fountaine of

            </p>
            <p>In another ſpeech (again) uſed by the ſaid
Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> in the lower houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
by occaſion of a motion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the union of Laws, he ſpoke thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it pleaſe you (Maſter Speaker)
were it now a time to wiſh as it is to adviſe,
no man ſhould be more forward, or more
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115875:153"/>
earneſt then my ſelf in this wiſh, that his
Majeſties ſubjects of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>were governed by one law; and that for
many reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Becauſe it will be an infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
that there will never be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe
in ſucceeding ages to a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Dulcis tractus pari jugo; <hi>if the
draught lie moſt upon us, and the yoak lie
leaſt on them, or inverſe-wiſe, it is not
equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The qualities, and (as I may
terme it) the elements of their Laws and
ours are ſuch as do promiſe an excellent
temperature in the compounded body; for
if the prerogative here be too indefinite, it
may be the liberty there is too unbounded:
if our laws and proceedings be too prolix
and formal, it may be theirs are too infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and ſummary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>I do diſcern, to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there will be no great difficulty in this
work: for their Laws by that I can learn,
compared with ours, are like their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
for as their Language hath the ſame
roots that ours hath, but hath a little more
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115875:153"/>
mixture of Latine and French: ſo their
Laws and cuſtoms have the like grounds
that ours have, with a little more mixture
of the civil Law and French cuſtoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, The mean to this work ſeemeth
to me no leſs excellent, then the work it
ſelf; for if both Laws ſhall be united, it is
of neceſſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for preparation and inducement
thereunto, that our own laws be renewed
and recompiled, then the which, I think
there cannot be a work more politick<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more
honorable nor more beneficial to the ſubjects
of the land for all ages; for this continual
heaping up of Laws without digeſting them,
maketh but a</hi> Chaos <hi>and confuſion, and
turneth the Laws many times to become
but ſnares to the people: and therefore this
work I eſteem to be indeed a work (rightly
to terme it)</hi> Heroical, <hi>and that which if I
might live to ſee, I would not deſire to
live after. So that for this good wiſh of
union of Laws, I do conſent to the full.</hi> A
little after he ſayes, <hi>that this union of Laws
ſhould not precede the naturalization, nor
go along with it</hi> paripaſſu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>but altogether
ſucceed it, and that not in the precedence
of an inſtant, but in diſtance of time, becauſe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115875:154"/>
the union of Laws will ask a great time to
be perfected, both for the compiling and
for the paſſing of them; during all which
time, if this mark of ſtrangeneſs ſhould
be denied to be taken away, I fear it
may induce ſuch a habit of ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as will rather be an impediment
then a preparation to further proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And albeit in the concluſion of his ſpeech he
ſaith, <hi>that he holdeth this motion of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Laws very worthy, and ariſing from
very good minds, but not proper for that
time;</hi> yet do I think that, for this time, and as
the juncture of affaires is for the preſent, it is
very proper and expedient.</p>
            <p>Therefore, although, in ſome parcels of
the foreſaid diſcourſe not here recited, many
pregnant reaſons to thoſe that oppoſed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization
of the <hi>Scots,</hi> becauſe that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was annexed to <hi>England</hi> by inheritance,
and not conqueſt, be exhibited, to ſhew that
the grant of the benefit thereof ſhould not be
obſtructed, for that <hi>Scotland</hi> was not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Country; as alſo why the <hi>Scots</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willigneſs
to receive the Engliſh Laws, ſhould
be no impediment to their Naturalization:
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115875:154"/>
and that in <hi>Robert Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, which is
extant to be ſeen in the ſeventh book of Sir
<hi>Edward Cook</hi>'s Reports, many excellent things
are deduced in favour of the <hi>poſt<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ati</hi> of that
Realm, notwithſtanding the diverſity of Laws,
and <hi>Scotland</hi>'s then unacknowledged ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
to the meer Authority of this Land;
Yet ſeeing the face of affairs is quite altered
from what it was then, and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
civility and good carriage may gain ſo much
upon the affections of the people there, as to
make them in a very ſhort ſpace to be of the
ſame Cuſtoms, Manners, and Language
with them; I do really believe if <hi>Sir Francis
Bacon</hi> and <hi>Sir Edward Cook</hi> were now
living, that both of them would unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
adviſe the State and Soverainty of this
Iſland to allow unto <hi>Scotland</hi> (which neither
is nor never was a Kingdom more then <hi>Wales</hi>
was of old) the ſame priviledges and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
(in every thing) that <hi>Wales</hi> now hath, (and
which the <hi>Scots</hi> have in <hi>France,</hi> a tranſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
Country) to enjoy everywhere in all
things, the emoluments and benefit competent
to the free-born ſubjects of <hi>England;</hi> and to
this effect, to impower that Nation with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to chuſe their repreſentattves to be ſen
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115875:155"/>
hither to this their ſoveraigne Parliament,
that the publick truſtees of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Wales,</hi> may at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> jointly
concur for the weal of the whole Iſle, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of one and the ſame incorporation. Theſe
two Knights, one whereof was Lord high
Chancellor of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp; the other Atturny
General, and Lord chief Juſtice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
pleas, were good and wiſe men, full of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
free from prevarication and by-reſpects,
learned Lawyers, excellent Scholars, fluent
Orators and (above all) worthy, loving, and
ſincere patriots of <hi>England;</hi> for which cauſe
I hope ſo many exquiſite qualities meeting (as
it were) in one conſtellation, by vertue of a
powerfull influence upon the mindes of the
ſupreame Senate of the Land, will incline the
hearts of every one not to diſſent from the
Judgement and approbation of theſe two ſo
eminent Judges and zealous Engliſh men;
and that ſo much the rather, that to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of ſo commendable a work, we
are conducted by nature it ſelf, which, having
made us <hi>diviſos orbe Britannos,</hi> ſheweth, (by
the <hi>antiperiſtatick</hi> faculty of a fountain or
ſpring-well in the Summer ſeaſon, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to be the colder within it ſelf, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115875:155"/>
circumobreſiſtence of heat be in the aire,
which ſurrounds it) that we ſhould cordially
cloſe to one another, unite our Forces, and
the more vigourouſly improve the internal
ſtrength we have of our ſelves, the greater that
the outward oppoſition and hoſtility appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us of the circumjacent outlandiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which inviron us on all ſides.</p>
            <p>This was not heeded in ancient times, by
reaſon of the ſurquedry of the old <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
who looked on the <hi>Scots</hi> with a malignant
aſpect; and the profound policie of the
<hi>French,</hi> in caſting (for their own ends) the
ſpirit of diviſion betwixt the two Nations, to
widen the breach. But now that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
have attained to a greater dexterity in encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
their <hi>facienda</hi>'s of State, and deeper
reach in conſidering what for the future may
prove moſt honourable and lucrative, will
(like an expert Phyſician to a patient ſick of a
Conſumption in his <hi>noble</hi> parts, who applieth
cordials and not coroſives; and lenitives rather
then cauters) ſtrive more (as I imagine) to gain
the love and affection of the <hi>Scots,</hi> thereby to
ſave the expence of any more blood or mony,
then for overthrowing them quite in both their
bodies and fortunes, to maintain the charge of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115875:156"/>
an everlaſting war againſt the ſtorms of the
climate, the fierceneſs of diſcontented People,
inacceſſibility of the hills, and ſometimes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
penury, the mother of plague and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine;
all which inconveniences may be eaſily
prevented without any charge at all, by the
ſole gaining of the hearts of the country.</p>
            <p>By which means, patching up old rents,
cementing what formerly was broken, and by
making of ancient foes new friends, we will
ſtrengthen our ſelves, and weaken our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and raiſe the Iſle of <hi>Britain</hi> to that
height of glory, that it will become formidable
to all the world beſides.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the better to incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the three Dominions of <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Wales,</hi> and more firmely to conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate
their union, it were not amiſs (in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion)
that (as little rivers, which uſe to loſe
their names when they run along into the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of a great flood) they have their own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
titles laid aſide, and totally diſchaged
into the vaſt gulph of that of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if upon any emergent occaſion, it be
thought fit to make mention of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and
the ſeveral Dominions of <hi>Brttain,</hi> in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115875:156"/>
enumeration, to place <hi>Ireland</hi> (as I
conceive it) before <hi>Scotland,</hi> is very prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
not but that <hi>Ireland</hi> is a far more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Country, and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> may be as
good as any men: that the <hi>Scots</hi> in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
yeers may be much degenerated from the
magnanimity of their fore-Fathers, and that
the ſucceeding progeny may perhaps prove
little better; or as you will: for be the ſoile or
climate never ſo good or bad, with a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
or rather immutability in either of thoſe
qualities, the reſpective natives and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereof will nevertheleſs, according to
the change of times, be ſubject to a viciſſitude
of vice and vertue, as may appear by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> now,
compared with thoſe of their Anceſtors, in the
days of <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Hannibal:</hi> but onely
that I conceive priority to be more due to
<hi>Scotland</hi> (although I ſhould ſpeak nothing of
its more immaculate reputation both abroad
and at home, and of a longer ſeries of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns
that ſwayed Scepter there in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
uninterrupted ſucceſſion) and that becauſe
of its greater conformity with, and proximity
to the Nation of <hi>England;</hi> the People where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
if they would imitate the faſhion of the
warlike <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:115875:157"/>
as the <hi>Romans</hi> did, <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Gaules,</hi> or
<hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Sicilians,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi>
vicinity and nearer adjacence to <hi>Rome;</hi>
although <hi>Sicilie</hi> was more fruitfull and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
then <hi>Latium,</hi> and the <hi>Gaules</hi> more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
and every whit as fierce in the field as
the <hi>Latins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am afraid that I have treſpaſſed a little
upon the patience of the Reader, by inſiſting ſo
long in my diſcourſe upon <hi>Scotland:</hi> yet in
regard of my obligation and bound duty to
the <hi>Author</hi> of the above-recited loſt Papers,
whoſe native ſoyle it is, I could hardly do
leſs, ſeeing it is for the good of him, that this
whole tractate is compiled, and to his behalf,
who expects not, (as hath been ſaid already in
the 203 page, and abundantly proved by the
fifteenth <hi>Axiom)</hi> either recompenſe or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his Countrys ſake: he likewiſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,
by vertue of the ſaid <hi>axiom,</hi> that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a meer Priſoner of war, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delinquencie, will not militate much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the ſubjects of the Land, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of his, attain to what is conducible to
them, in ſaving of expence, as by the diſcovery
proffered to the publick, he is able to make
good, when required thereto: that either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or lands, if not both, ſhould be due to him
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115875:157"/>
for the diſcloſure of ſo prime a ſecret, is
clearly demonſtrated by the ſixteenth: and
that the State will be no leſs courteous and
favourable to him, then to any other Priſoner
of war proportionably, is plainly evidenced
by the ſeventeenth: That the ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Iſle, in matter of the liberty of his
perſon, and that of his brothers and menial
ſervants, together with the enjoyment of his
own houſes, lands and rents, free from ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
confiſcation, compoſition, and gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
ſhould allow him the ſame conditions
granted to any other no more deſerving then
himſelf, is manifeſtly proved by the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth:
that therefore he ſhould obtaine the
greater favours (as aforeſaid) is proved by
the nineteeth: and that if to no other priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of all his Country be truly competent, but
to himſelf alone, the ample character (in all its
branches, as it is ſpecified in the 232, 233,
234, &amp; 235, pages) which I have given of him,
and could not conceal, being much leſs then
his due; then, in ſtead of a recompence for the
ſurpluſage of wherein others are defective,
which he covets not, none certainly of all the
Scotiſh Nation, whether Priſoner or other,
ſhould receive from the State ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and courteſies as himſelf, becauſe (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115875:158"/>
prejudice be it ſpoke to any man) he did
from the beginning of theſe inteſtine broyles
walk in an even, if not a more conſtant track
of blameleſs carriage, free from hypocriſie, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
and tergiverſation, then any of his
compatriots: that notwithſtanding the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his allegience to ſupreme authority, and
the many ties of obedience that lie upon any
ſubject whatſoever, he may by vertue of his
owne merit deſerve a reward from the State,
is clear by the twentieth: and that for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
of this invention and others, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
acceptance, which are ſo properly his
own, that no other braine, that ever was or is,
did contribute any thing to their eduction, he
may lawfully claim right to a competency of
retribution, is made patent by the one and
twentieth.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, the Author deſiring no more
but the grant of the foreſaid demands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by the ſtrict rule of commutative
juſtice, it ſhould ſeem to be a reward by too
many ſtages inferior to the diſcovery of ſo
prime an invention; yet that the State doth
him neither wrong nor injuſtice therein, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he be not denyed of what he requireth, is
fully cleared by the two and twentieth or laſt
<hi>Axiome.</hi>

This Apodictick courſe by a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
method theorematically to infer conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from infallible maximes, with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſuccinctneſs, I thought fit to imbrace;
becauſe, to have analytically couched thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,

and accompanied with Apoſtrophes;
and laſtly, with Allegories of all ſorts, whether
Apologal, Affabulatory, Parabolary, Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick,

Schematologetically adorning the propoſed
Theam with the moſt eſpecial and chief flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

no figure either of Diction or Sentence,
that might contribute to the ears inchantment,
or perſwaſion of the hearer.</p>
            <p>I could have introduced, in caſe of obſcurity,
Synonymal, Exargaſtick, and Palilogetick
Elucidations; for ſweetneſs of phraſe, Antime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tathetick
commutations of Epithets: for the
vehement excitation of a matter, exclamations
in the front, and Epiphonema's in the reer. I
could have uſed, for the promptlyer ſtirring up
of paſſion, Apoſtrophal and Proſopopocial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions:
and for the appenſing and ſetling
of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome Epanorthotick revocations, and
Apoſiopetick reſtraints. I could have inſerted
Dialogiſmes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſplaying their Interrogatory
part with communicatively-Pyſmatick and
Suſtentative flouriſhes; or Proleptically, with
the refutative Schemes of Anticipation and

Subjection: and that part which concerns the
Reſponſory, with the figures of permiſſion and

            <p>Speeches extending a matter beyond what it
is, Auxetically, Digreſſively, Tranſititiouſly, by

with words diminiſhing the worth of a

that I needed to have omitted: nor, had

            <p>All thoſe Figures and Tropes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides what
are not here mentioned (theſe Synecdochically
ſtanding for all, to ſhun the tediouſneſs of a
too prolixe enumeration) I could have adhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the embelliſhment of this Tractate, had
not the matter it ſelf been more prevalent with
me, then the ſuperficial formality of a quaint
diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I could have firreted out of Topick Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luls
ſuch variety of arguments tending to my
purpoſe, and ſeconded them with ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
refutations, confirmations, and Proſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſtick
deductions, as after the large
manner of their ſeveral amplifications accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the rules of Art would, contexed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
have framed a book of a great <hi>quarto</hi>
ſize, in an Arithmetical proportion of length to
its other two Dimenſions of bredth and
thickneſs; that is to ſay, its bredth ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the thickneſs thereof by the ſame number
of inches and no more, that it is ſurpaſſed
by the length; in which conſidering the body
thereof could be contained no leſs then ſeven
quires of paper at leaſt; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this ſo great a bulk, I could have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115875:160"/>
the contents of its whole ſubjected mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo appoſitely into partitions, for facilitating
an impreſſion in the Readers memory, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it to the underſtanding in ſo ſprucela
garb, that ſpirits bleſt with leiſure, and free
from the urgency of ſerious employments,
would happily have beſtowed as liberally
ſome few houres thereon, as on the peruſal of
a new-coined Romancy, or ſtrange hiſtory of
love-adventures.</p>
            <p>For although the figures and tropes above
rehearſed ſeem in their <hi>actu ſignato</hi> (as they
ſignifie meer notional circumſtances, affections,
adjuncts, and dependences on words, to be a
little Pedantical, and to the ſmooth touch of a
delicate ear, ſomewhat harſh and ſcabrous: yet
in their exerced act (as they ſuppone for things
reduplicatively as things in the firſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the minde by them ſignified) I could,
even in far abſtruſer purpoſes, have ſo fitly
adjuſted them with apt and proper termes,
and with ſuch perſpicuity couched them, as
would have been ſuitable to the capacities of
courtiers and young Ladies, whoſe tender
hearing, for the moſt part, being more taken
with the inſinuating harmony of a well-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
period, in its Iſocoletick and pariſonal
members, then with the never-ſo-pithy a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a learned ſubject, deſtitute of the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſneſs
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115875:161"/>
of ſo Pathetick ornaments, will ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
convey perſwaſion to the interior facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
from the raviſhing aſſault of a well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
diction, in a parade of curioſly-muſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
words in their ſeveral ranks and files, then
by the vigour and fierceneſs of never ſo many
powerful ſquadrons of a promiſcuouſly-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
elocution into bare Logical arguments:
for the ſweetneſs of their diſpoſition is more
eaſily gained by undermining paſſion, then
ſtorming reaſon; and by the muſick and
Symmetry of a diſcourſe in its external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances,
then by all the puiſſance ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
of the ditty or purpoſe diſcloſed by it.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the prime ſcope of this Treatiſe
is to teſtifie my utmoſt endeavours to do all
the ſervice I can to Sir <hi>Thomas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rquhart,</hi>
both for the procuring of his liberty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
the State, whoſe priſoner he is, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him the enjoyment of his own, leſt by his
thraldome and diſtreſs (uſeful to no man) the
publick ſhould be deprived of thoſe excellent
inventions, whoſe emiſſion totally dependeth
upon the grant of his enlargement and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in both eſtate and perſon: and that to a
State which reſpecteth ſubſtance more then ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
the body more then the ſhadow,
and ſolidity more then oſtentation, it would
argue great indiſcretion in me, to become no
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115875:161"/>
other waies a ſuiter for that worthy gentleman
then by emancipating my vein upon the full
carreer of Rhetorical excurſions, approving
my ſelf thereby like to thoſe Navigators, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and Horſemen, who uſe more ſaile then
ballaſt, more powder then ball, and employ
the ſpur more then the bridle:</p>
            <p>Therefore is it, that laying aſide all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
of thoſe advantages and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
a neat expreſſion in fluent termes hath
over the milder ſexe and Miniard youth, and
ſetting before my eyes the reverence and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of thoſe ſupereminent men to whom my
expectation of their non-refuſal of my requeſt
hath emboldened me to make my addreſſes; I
hold it now expedient (without further adoe)
to ſtop the current of my pen, and, in token
of the duty I owe to him whoſe cauſe I here
aſſert, to give way to his more literate and
compleat elucubrations; which that they may
the ſooner appear to the eyes of the world, for
the advancement of both vertue and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I yet once more, and that moſt heartily,
beſeech the preſent State, Parliament, and
ſupream Councel of great <hi>Britain,</hi> to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
unto the aforeſaid Sir <hi>Thomas <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rquhart
of Cromarty knight, heritable Sheriff and
proprietary thereof,</hi> a grant of the releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his perſon from any impriſonment
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115875:162"/>
whereunto at the diſcretion of thoſe that took
his parole he is ingaged; the poſſeſſion likewiſe
of his houſe of <hi>Cromarty</hi> free from gariſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the enjoyment of his whole eſtate in
lands, without affecting it with any other ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick or private burthen then hath been
of his own contracting, and that with the
dignities thereto belonging of hereditary
Sheriff-ſhip, patronage of the three Churches
there, and Admiralty of the Seas betwixt
<hi>Catneſs</hi> and <hi>Innernaſs</hi> incluſively (with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
nevertheleſs to the high Admiral of
the land) together with all the other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and immunities, which, both in his
perſon, and that of his predeceſſors, hath been
from time to time accounted due by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itance
to the houſe of <hi>Cromarty,</hi> and that for
the love of the whole Iſland on which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth,
in compenſation, to beſtow a benefit
(under pain of forfeiture of all he hath) of ten
times more worth. As this is my humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <p>I Have not mentioned here Lieutenant General
<hi>John Midletoun,</hi> Lieutenant General Sir <hi>William
Balfour,</hi> nor General Major Sir <hi>George Monro,</hi> &amp;c.
becauſe they returned from the forraign countryes,
where they did officiate (though in places over both
horſe and foot of great concernment) before they had
obtained the charge of Colonels.</p>
            <p>As for pricking down into colums thoſe other <hi>Scots</hi> in
my book renowned for literature and perſonal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
I held it not expedient; for that the ſum of
them doth fall ſo far ſhort of the number I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that proportioned to the aggregate of all
<pb facs="tcp:115875:164"/>
who in that Nation, ſince the yeer 1650. (without
reckoning any intruſted in military employments, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at home or abroad) have deſerved praiſe in
Armes and Arts, joyntly or diſ-junctively, it would
bear the <hi>Analogy</hi> (to uſe a leſſer definite for a greater
indefinite) of a <hi>ſubnovitripartient eights;</hi> that is to ſay
in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the whole being the <hi>Dividend,</hi> and
my Nomenclature the <hi>Diviſor,</hi> the <hi>quotient</hi> would be
<hi>nine,</hi> with a <hi>fraction</hi> of three eights: or yet more
clearly, as the Proportion of 72. to 675.</p>
