            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>First touching my knowledge, (I mean <hi>saving knowledge,</hi> without
which <hi>the soul cannot be good,</hi> as wise <hi>Solomon</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Prov. 19. 2.)</hi>
it was such, (though I thought my self wiser then to make scruple of, or
perplex my self about matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> as do the <hi>religious:</hi> even as the
King of <hi>Tyrus</hi> thought himself <hi>wiser then Daniel,</hi> Ezek. 28. 3.) that <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
things</hi> were mostly represented to my understanding false, and clean
contrary to what they are indeed. Like <hi>corporal things</hi> in a <hi>Looking-glass,</hi>
wherein those that are on the <hi>right hand</hi> seem to be on <hi>the left,</hi> and those
that are on the <hi>left hand</hi> seem to be on the <hi>right.</hi> As it fared with Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> while he was in his natural condition, <hi>Acts 26. 9.</hi> which made me
think and call <hi>evil, good;</hi> and <hi>good, evil; bitter, sweet;</hi> and <hi>sweet, bitter;</hi> to
<hi>justifie the wicked,</hi> &amp; <hi>condemn the just,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> complains, <hi>Isa. 5. 20, 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for instance, I most sottishly thought, that I both <hi>loved,</hi> and <hi>served
God</hi> as I ought; yea, I should have taken it in four scorn, if any one had
questioned the same: when indeed I was a <hi>Traitor to God, and took up
arms against all that worshipped him in Spirit and in truth.</hi> I was so far from
<hi>loving</hi> and <hi>serving</hi> him, that I hated those that did it; and that for their
so doing, I could also hear him <hi>blasphemed, reproached,</hi> and <hi>dishonored,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being once stirred or moved at it. I loved him dearly, but I could
never affoard to speak a word for him; and likewise his Children intirely,
but instead of justifying them, or speaking in their defence when I heard
them <hi>scoft, scorned</hi> &amp; <hi>abused</hi> by wicked &amp; ungodly men; all my delight was
to <hi>jeer</hi> at, <hi>flight</hi> and <hi>slander</hi> them where ever I came. I more <hi>feared the
Magistrate,</hi> then I <hi>feared God;</hi> and more regarded the <hi>blasts of men's
breath,</hi> then the <hi>fire of God's wrath.</hi> I chose rather to <hi>disobey God,</hi> then to
<hi>displease great ones;</hi> and feared more the <hi>worlds scorns,</hi> then <hi>his anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the like of <hi>Christ</hi> that died for me; a strong argument that I <hi>loved
Christ,</hi> when I <hi>hated</hi> all that resembled him in <hi>holiness.</hi> Yea, I so <hi>hated
holiness,</hi> that I most bitterly <hi>hated men for being holy:</hi> insomuch that my
<hi>blood</hi> would <hi>rise</hi> at the sight of a <hi>good man,</hi> as some stomachs will rise at
the fight of <hi>sweet-meats.</hi> I was a <hi>Christian in name,</hi> but I could scoffe at a
<hi>Christian indeed;</hi> I could honour the <hi>dead Saints</hi> in a formal profession,
while I worried the <hi>living Saints</hi> in a cruel <hi>persecution. I</hi> condemned all for
<hi>Roundheads,</hi> that had more Religion then a <hi>Heathen;</hi> or knowledg of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things,</hi> then a <hi>child in the womb</hi> hath of the <hi>things of this life;</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
then an <hi>Atheist;</hi> or care of his soul, then a <hi>Beast.</hi> I had alwaies
the <hi>basest thoughts</hi> of the <hi>best men:</hi> making <hi>ill constructions</hi> of whatsoever
they <hi>did</hi> or <hi>spake:</hi> as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> dealt by <hi>our Saviour.</hi>

the divell and all flesh are lyers.</p>
                  <p>When wee become regenerate, and forsake sin; then the <hi>divell</hi> strongly,
and strangely assaults us: as he did <hi>Christ,</hi> when he was newly <hi>baptized;</hi> and
<hi>Pharoh the Children of Israel,</hi> when they would forsake <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Herod
the Children,</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> was come to deliver his people. Whence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
it coms to pass, that those <hi>think best of themselves, that have least
cause;</hi> yea the <hi>true Christian,</hi> is as <hi>fearfull to entertain</hi> a good opinion of
himself; as <hi>the false is unwilling, to he driven from it.</hi> They that have <hi>store
of grace, mourn for the want</hi> of it: and they that indeed <hi>want it, chant
their abundance.</hi> None so apt to <hi>doubt</hi> their adoption, as they that may
be <hi>assured</hi> of it: nor none more usually <hi>fear,</hi> then they that have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>cause to hope.</hi> Wee feel <hi>corruption</hi> not by corruption, but by <hi>grace:</hi>
and therefore <hi>the more wee feel</hi> our inward <hi>corruptions; the more grace</hi> we
have.</p>
                  <p>Contraries, the neerer they are to one another, the sharper is the conflict
betwixt them: now of all enemies, the <hi>spirit</hi> and the <hi>flesh</hi> are neerest one
to another, being both in the <hi>soul</hi> of a regenerate man; and in all <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of the soul, and in every <hi>action</hi> that springeth from those <hi>faculties.</hi>
The more grace, the more spirituall life; and the more spirituall life,
the more antipathy to the contrary: whence none are so <hi>sensible of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi>
as those that have the <hi>most living souls.</hi>

               <p>Now for <hi>remedy</hi> of the contrary, there cannot be a better <hi>lesson</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men to learn then this. All the <hi>promises of God</hi> are <hi>conditionall,</hi> to
take place if wee <hi>repent:</hi> as all the <hi>threatnings of God</hi> are <hi>conditionall,</hi> to take
place if wee <hi>repent not.</hi> But wicked men, as they <hi>believ without repenting;</hi>
their <hi>faith</hi> being meer <hi>presumption:</hi> so they <hi>repent without believing,</hi> their
repentance being indeed <hi>desperation:</hi> and this observe, wee are <hi>cast down</hi>
in the disappointing of our hopes; <hi>in the same measure,</hi> as we were too much
<hi>listed up,</hi> in expectation of good from them. Whence these perremptory
presumers if ever they repent, it is commonly <hi>as Francis Spira,</hi> an <hi>Advocate
of Padua</hi> did: and never did any man plead so well <hi>for himself,</hi> as he did
<hi>against himself.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60747:6"/>
One <hi>star</hi> is much <hi>bigger then the Earth;</hi> yet it seems many degrees <hi>less.</hi>
It is the nature of <hi>fear,</hi> to make <hi>dangers greater, helps lesse</hi> then they are.
<hi>Christ</hi> hath promised peace and rest unto their souls that <hi>labour, and
are heavy laden;</hi> and to those <hi>that walk according to rule. Matth. 11. 29.
Gal. 6. 16. even peace celestiall</hi> in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>grace, and</hi> peace <hi>eternall</hi> in
the <hi>state of glory.</hi> Such therefore as never were distressed in conscience, or
live loosly; never had true peace. <hi>Peace</hi> is the <hi>Daughter of righteousnesse.
Rom. 5. 1. Being justifyed by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> But hee who
makes <hi>a bridg of his own shaddow,</hi> will be sure to <hi>fall into the water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those blocks,</hi> that never in their life were moved with <hi>Gods threatnings,</hi>
never in any straight of conscience, never groaned under the burthen of
<hi>Gods anger:</hi> they have not so much as entred into the <hi>porch of this house;</hi>
or lift a foot over the <hi>threshold, of this School of repentance.</hi> Oh! that wee
could but so much <hi>fear the eternall pains, as</hi> wee do the <hi>temporary;</hi> and
bee but so carefull to save <hi>our souls</hi> from torment, as <hi>our bodies.</hi> In the
mean time, the case of these men is so much <hi>the worse;</hi> by how much
<hi>there fear is the lesse.</hi> It faring with the soul, as with the body: Those <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,</hi>
which do <hi>take away all sence of pain;</hi> are of all others <hi>most desperate.</hi>
As the <hi>dead palsey,</hi> the <hi>falling sickness,</hi> the <hi>sleepy lethargie,</hi> &amp;c. And the
<hi>patient</hi> is most <hi>dangerously sick,</hi> when he hath <hi>no feeling</hi> thereof. In like
manner, whilst they suppose themselves to be free from <hi>judgment;</hi> they
are already smitten with the <hi>heaviest of Gods judgments;</hi> a heart that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
repent. <hi>Rom. 2. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a <hi>lethargie,</hi> it is needfull the <hi>patient</hi> should be cast into a <hi>burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
because the <hi>sences</hi> are <hi>benummed,</hi> and this will <hi>waken them,</hi> and <hi>dry
up</hi> the <hi>besotting humors.</hi> So in our dead securety, before our conversion;
<hi>God is</hi> fain to let the <hi>Law, Sin, Conscience</hi> and <hi>Satan loose</hi> upon us; and
to <hi>kindle</hi> the very <hi>fire of Hell</hi> in our souls: that so we might be rowsed
out of our security: but thousands of these blocks, both <hi>live and depart</hi>
with as <hi>great hopes,</hi> as men go to a <hi>lottery:</hi> even <hi>dreaming of Heaven, untill</hi>
they <hi>awakein Hell.</hi> For they too often die, without any remors of conscience
<hi>like blocks;</hi> or <hi>as an Oxe dyes in a ditch.</hi> Yea thousands that <hi>live</hi> like <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,
dye</hi> like <hi>Nabal,</hi> (which is but the same word inverted.) whilest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the dear Children of <hi>God,</hi> dye in distresse of conscience. For it is
not every good mans hap, to dye like <hi>Antonius Pius;</hi> whose <hi>death</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fassion, and semblance of a kindly, and <hi>pleasant sleep.</hi> However
<hi>Saint Austins rule,</hi> will be sure to hold. He <hi>cannot dye ill,</hi> that hath lived well:
and for the most part, He that <hi>lives conscionably, dyes comfortably,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
rich. And so you see, how it fares with the wickedest and worst
of men. Wherefore if you are truly sensible of your wretchedness: it is
a good sign, that you are in some forwardness to be recovered; and really
to become so good, as formerly you but dream'd, or imagined your self
to bee. And indeed the very <hi>first step to grace, is to feel the want of grace;</hi>
and the next way to <hi>receive mercy,</hi> is to <hi>see your self miserable.</hi> Therefore
our constant, and most diligent search should be, to find out the naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our own hearts; and to get strenght from <hi>God,</hi> against our prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
corruptions.</p>

               <p>Finally, each sanctified heart feels this, but no words are able sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

So that we have <hi>no merit,</hi> but the <hi>mercy of God</hi> to save us: nothing but the

<hi>his obedience to enrich us.</hi> As for our <hi>good works,</hi> we are altogether behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
