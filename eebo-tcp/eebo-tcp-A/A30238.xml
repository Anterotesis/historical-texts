            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt, A difficulty of having pure and right intentions therein, even the Glory of God, and the Edification of others. For as in Preaching, ſo in Printing; Pride, Vain-glory, and Self-ends are apt to creep in, whereby there is a temptation to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate thoſe things, which may be for oſtentation, more than utility. And <hi>Euge Bernarde, benè ſcribis,</hi> may importunately preſſe it ſelf into the heart, as
<pb facs="tcp:48709:3"/>
well as <hi>benèdicis.</hi> Inſomuch that we are to looke upon the time, wherein we are preparing any thing for the publick view, as the hour of temptation, earneſtly praying unto God for humility, mortification, and a publick frame of heart. For as <hi>Gregory</hi> once ſaid, <hi>Tutius auditur veritas, quam praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur,</hi> The Auditor is in more ſafety, while hearing, than the Preacher, while ſpeaking, becauſe of the vain motions which are ready then to ariſe in the heart; ſo is the Reader in leſſe temptation than the Authour of the Book. A ſecond cauſe of ſuch exact watchfulneſſe, is the difficulty of working thoſe Truths in a ſavoury experimental power, upon our own hearts, which we communicate to others; whereby we may fear leaſt while we write for others, we our ſelves be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Quid tibi proderit lingua aurea, ſi cor ferreum?</hi> VVhat will a Golden Tongue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, if a man have a ſenſleſſe heart at that time? This then is a cauſe of godly trembling, <hi>Ne illae lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae vicariae oris noſtri, in die judicii, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus nos proferantur,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid; Leaſt our writings witneſſe againſt us, as publiſhing thoſe things, the experimental power whereof we never felt upon our hearts. Such conſiderations as theſe may be apt to deterre from writing. For as for thoſe ordinary and cuſtomary Apologies againſt the ſevere <hi>Momuſſes,</hi> and ſharp <hi>Ariſtarchuſſes</hi> of the world,
<pb facs="tcp:48709:3"/>
they are comparatively contemptible. But yet though there be theſe Lyons in the way, we are not through ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs <hi>to hide our talent in a napkin,</hi> but where Opportunity offereth it ſelfe, there to imbrace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Its a pleaſant and profitable work to be <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging gold out of this mine, to adorne the Temple of God;</hi> to be <hi>cutting down tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> out of <hi>this wood,</hi> for <hi>Gods houſe;</hi> to be <hi>plucking off the leaves</hi> and <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>this tree</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> which are both <hi>medicinal</hi> and <hi>alimental.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>medicum myropolium,</hi> an <hi>Apothecaries ſhop,</hi> whereby all the <hi>ſpiritual diſeaſes</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> may be <hi>cured.</hi> It's <hi>Bellicum armamentarium,</hi> a <hi>Magazine of warre,</hi> by which all <hi>errours</hi> and <hi>here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:48709:4"/>
not onely becauſe of the <hi>univerſal concernment</hi> of that <hi>excellent matter</hi> contained therein, but alſo becauſe there are few, who have <hi>ſelected</hi> that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> on purpoſe to treat upon. So that whereas there are many <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> particularly <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,</hi> and <hi>illuſtrated</hi> by ſeveral <hi>learned Authours,</hi> yet this hath been paſt by. Yea when the <hi>former Epiſtle</hi> hath had its <hi>Commentators,</hi> as <hi>Martyr, Pareus, Morton,</hi> yet this hath been pretermitted. As therefore God ſhall give life and opportunity, I ſhall endeavour the true and ſound <hi>Expoſition</hi> of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> eſpecially ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all <hi>Doctrinals</hi> and <hi>controverſals</hi> to <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticals</hi> and <hi>experimentals,</hi> which is the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of all. For to have <hi>Books</hi> only in our <hi>heads,</hi> and not in our <hi>hearts,</hi> doth bring (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>much wearineſſe to the fleſh;</hi> yea ſometimes much <hi>detriment,</hi> as <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpeaketh of a <hi>young man</hi> in his <hi>Tractate, De ſimplificatione cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> who by an indiſcreet laboriouſneſſe in reading <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm</hi>'s Meditations, fell into ſuch a bodily diſtemper, that the very beholding of a Booke, that was written, would afterwards put him into an horrour and vertigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous giddineſſe. Thus worldly reading (as I may ſo call it) cauſeth death, but ſpiritual and godly improving of the Books we peruſe, will be like <hi>oil to the wheels,</hi> that the <hi>work of grace</hi> may <hi>ſucceed</hi> more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48709:4"/>
I ſhall not trouble thee with an <hi>enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration</hi> of what <hi>different,</hi> and yet <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable matter,</hi> is treated on in this <hi>firſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter</hi> preſented to thy <hi>view,</hi> that is done to thee by <hi>another hand</hi> in the <hi>Table</hi> or <hi>Contents;</hi> only my requeſt is, that the <hi>Errata,</hi> which may ſome times be committed, and the rather, becauſe of my <hi>diſtance</hi> from the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the Diſcourſe.

               </p>
               <p>The Verſe divided into theſe parts, will afford ſeveral Obſervations. And</p>

                  </note> what he was. His name is <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo conſtantly in his Epiſtles, but in the Hiſtory of his life in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> he was conſtantly called <hi>Saul,</hi> till <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. In the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Now concerning his <hi>name,</hi> the conjectures of learned men are divers. <hi>Beza</hi> thinketh <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to be the ſame name with a different dialect. Others ſay, he had two names, and they are different. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> thinketh Chriſt did in an immediate manner give him this name, thereby making <hi>Paul</hi> his ſervant in a peculiar manner; <hi>Impoſition of names being a demonſtration of dominion.</hi> Thus he altered <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Jacobs</hi> names. Others they ſay, it was in an humane way he was named <hi>Paul,</hi> either becauſe of the converſion of <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 13. the Proconſul, who out of indeared affection to <hi>Paul,</hi> would have him called by his name; or as <hi>Auſtin</hi> thinketh, <hi>Paul</hi> aſſumed it himſelf, as ſignifying <hi>one that is little,</hi> to ſhew his modeſty, he calling himſelf the leaſt of all the Apoſtles.

                     </gap>ligers</hi> conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture ſeemeth moſt probable, That when the <hi>Jews</hi> were brought in ſubjection to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they had commonly two names, one of <hi>their own Nation,</hi> and another <hi>Roman,</hi> to ingratiate themſelves, and alſo for more familiar converſe; and therefore <hi>Saul</hi> is not called <hi>Paul,</hi> till upon the ſetting him apart to preach unto the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But this is not ſo great a matter, as the conſideration of his <hi>perſon,</hi> and his <hi>life</hi> what he was, and by the hiſtory of his <hi>life,</hi> which he himſelf alſo makes often mention of; he was a cruel and bloudy perſecutor of the Church <note place="margin">

Obſerve,</p>

Paul</hi> might have wrote this, <hi>Paul once the greatest of ſinners, to the Corinthians the greateſt of ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To open this, let us take notice of <hi>Paul</hi> his <hi>ſinnes,</hi> his <hi>work of grace,</hi> and his <hi>ſerviceableneſs</hi> after his converſion.</p>
               <p>

For his <hi>ſins,</hi> how great they were he himſelf doth aggravate them ſufficiently; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> ſins great.</note> inſomuch that he ſaith, he was the <hi>chiefest of all ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. In what ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay this truly is diſputed; for it's plain, he was not a greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than ſuch who ſinned the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. Some therefore reſtrain it to <hi>converted ſinners,</hi> as if <hi>Paul</hi> meant, he was the greateſt ſinner that ever <note place="margin">How the chiefeſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> was converted. Others underſtand it thus, that he was in the number of the greateſt one of the chiefeſt, and that ſeemeth moſt genuine. He was a <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> a <hi>perſecuter;</hi> the <hi>blood, ſighes</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> of many Chriſtians would wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him. And although he ſaith, he did this in <hi>ignorance,</hi> yet that did not <hi>excuſe him;</hi> for he confeſſeth himſelf a <hi>blasphemer,</hi> and a <hi>perſecuter</hi> for all that: for this <hi>ignorance</hi> was <hi>vincible,</hi> it was <hi>affected</hi> and <hi>wilfull,</hi> he had means to the contrary. Behold then here a worſe ſinner than <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom ſeven Devils were caſt, for her ſinnes were <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>bodily,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſinnes were <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and ſeated principally in his <hi>ſoul,</hi> ſo that as the <hi>Devils</hi> are <hi>spiritual wickedneſſes,</hi> thus was <hi>Paul;</hi> and becauſe he was thus corrupted in his ſpirit, his diſeaſe was the more incurable. For, <hi>If the eye be dark, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> The prophane groſs ſinner, he is eaſily convinced, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently apprehenſive of his evil; but where ſinfullneſs hath poſſeſſed the <hi>vital parts</hi> of the ſoul, the <hi>mind</hi> and the <hi>heart,</hi> what hope can remain for ſuch an one? This made our Saviour ſay, <hi>The Publicans and Harlots entered the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven above the Phariſees.</hi> Now <hi>Paul</hi> he was a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and moſt zealous above others for the tradition of his fathers, and therefore thought his wilde zeal to be true love to God. A man then ſo great a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and yet ſo <hi>ſelf-confident,</hi> that he had all the diſadvantages in the world, yet is converted, and that when he had for ſome while lived in ſuch a way, being <hi>habituated</hi> and <hi>root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</hi> For, as ſome think, he was converted about the thirtieth year of his age.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>work of grace was admirable and wonderfull.</hi> Twice the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <note place="margin">The work of Gods grace wonderfull.</note> relateth it, while he was in the way, breathing out threatnings to the Church of God, even in this his wicked poſture, <hi>He was ſtriken to the ground, and a glorious light ſhone round about him.</hi> That as they ſay of ſome lightning, it melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>ſword;</hi> while it doth not hurt the <hi>ſcabbard</hi> at all: Thus <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>body</hi> not being any way hurt in this miraculous Viſion, his <hi>ſoul</hi> was wonderfully melted and changed, inſomuch that he crieth out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> This inſtance of <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion is an hammer to beat down the <hi>Arminian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: here they labour and ſweat to give a clear anſwer. Some of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that <hi>Paul</hi> was peremptorily elected, and that we are not to judge of mens <hi>ordinary</hi> converſion, by that which was <hi>extraordinary.</hi> Indeed we grant, that many things were wonderfull and extraordinary in <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion. It is not for men now to expect ſuch a Viſion and voice from Heaven immediately ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; but this we urge, That if God could do thus on <hi>Paul</hi>'s heart, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperably</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> working on it, making it of <hi>unwilling, willing,</hi> and yet not the natural liberty of <hi>Paul</hi>'s will deſtroyed, then God may ſtill demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſame <hi>efficacy of grace,</hi> and yet man in converſion not be turned into a ſtock or ſtone, as they charge the Orthodox. As <hi>Paul</hi> then had been a ſinner above meaſure, ſo he had alſo grace exceeding gracious in an overflowing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to him. Therefore how frequently and joyfully doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of the <hi>rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of grace,</hi> and Gods unſpeakable grace to him, alwayes debaſing himſelf, as the <hi>greateſt of ſinners,</hi> and the <hi>leaſt of all Saints, not worthy to be called an Apoſtle,</hi> and magnifying grace alwayes running out like the Sea, when he comes to ſpeak of Chriſt and grace.</p>
               <p>In the third place, His <hi>ſerviceableneſs,</hi> that was as wonderfull, <hi>I laboured</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> 
                  <hi>more than they.</hi> The Heathens <hi>Hercules</hi> is not comparable to him. To read how much he did, and how much he ſuffered for Chriſt, may make us ſtand amazed,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48709:15"/>
yet ſtill he ſaith, <hi>Not I, but the grace of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth infinitely expatiate upon all occaſions in the praiſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was like <hi>Moſes, whoſe face ſhined gloriouſly, but he did not know it.</hi> And thus <hi>Paul,</hi> though above all others in <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> for Chriſt, yet accounts of himſelf as nothing, and gives all to the <hi>grace of God;</hi> as none <hi>preached</hi> more than he did, ſo none <hi>wrote more Epiſtles</hi> than he did; he took care of all the Churches. Thus he, who formerly did his utmoſt to root out the <hi>Church of God,</hi> is now as zealous and active to eſtabliſh and propagate it. So that you ſee three wonderfull things in <hi>Paul,</hi> his <hi>ſinne,</hi> his <hi>converſion,</hi> and his <hi>godly life</hi> afterwards.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us conſider what Reaſons there may be, why God will chooſe ſuch great ſinners out of their high impieties, eſpecially to be <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> in the Church of God, ſeeing that the Scripture in thoſe qualifications for an Elder, requireth, <hi>That he be without blame, and one of a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 5. Therefore in the Apoſtles, who were the chief Officers, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Ancient, <hi>Otuli Dei, Sedes Chriſti,</hi> and <hi>Oculi Eccleſiae,</hi> this was much more to be expected. But there are theſe Reaſons may be given. <note place="margin">Reaſons why God of great ſinners often maketh ſuch eminent Saints. 1. On Gods part. 1. Hereby the power of God is manifeſted.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby the power and ſtrength of God is made evident.</hi> If men of civility only, and of ingenuous principles were brought home to Chriſt, it might be thought ſomething of men did promote our ſalvation; but when there is a direct and violent oppoſition in a mans wayes, yet to become converted and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, this may make us acknowledge with <hi>Paul, The exceeding greatneſs of his power to us who believe,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 19. And if (ſetting aſide ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary circumſtances) there is the <hi>ſame kind of power</hi> ſeen in every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, that was in <hi>Pauls;</hi> then it's plain, that God doth not onely uſe <hi>moral ſuaſions,</hi> as <hi>Arminians</hi> would have it, but alſo <hi>efficacious operations.</hi> So that we may bleſs God for this preſident of <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion; we may all by that ſee, what is done in the heart of every man, when turned to God. We do juſtly admire the power of God in <hi>Creation,</hi> and in all the <hi>wonderfull deliverances</hi> the Church hath; but the power of God upon mens hearts, making them to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in thoſe things, which formerly they <hi>hated;</hi> This may make us to <hi>ſing Pſalms</hi> in the admiration of Gods great power about the <hi>new creation,</hi> as well as the <hi>old creation</hi> of the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As Gods Power is hereby evidenced, ſo alſo his Wiſdom;</hi> and that in a two-fold reſpect: <note place="margin">2. Hereby the Wiſdom of God is clearly evidenced. 1.

                     <hi>Pauls</hi> learning</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was endowed with much learning, was ſo evident to <hi>Feſtus,</hi> that he told him, <hi>Much learning had made him mad.</hi> And the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> called him <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> Acts 14. He was for a while educated at <hi>Tarſus,</hi> where he was born, and it is recorded by <hi>Strabo,</hi> as <hi>Lapide</hi> citeth him; That the <hi>Tarſenſes</hi> were ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to literature, that they did excell <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And that he had peruſed humane Authors, appeareth in that three times he alledgeth Greek Poets. Now beſides this, he went alſo to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there was brought up at <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s feet, an eminent Doctor amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> And if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but his Epiſtles he wrote, this would abundantly declare the rare and admirable wiſdome he was endowed with. Inſomuch that <hi>Chryſoſtom 3. Hom.</hi> upon 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> ſpeaks of a Diſpute between a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Grecian;</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi> was not to be preferred before <hi>Plato?</hi> though <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> condemneth the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> argument as ridiculous and abſurd. Indeed the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaketh 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 6. That though he was rude in ſpeech, yet not in knowledge.</hi> Now it's queſtioned by Interpreters, In what ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was rude in ſpeech? Auſtin</hi> thought, he ſaid ſo only by conceſſion, and in the repute of the <hi>falſe Apoſtles,</hi> who accounted him ſo. But <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and others think, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh properly, and that he was really ſo; not but that he was full of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, only he did not uſe thoſe affected wayes of humane eloquence, as he ſpeaks in another place. He did not write as a <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> whom <hi>Plato</hi> cenſured as <gap reason="foreign">

And certainly, <hi>to paint a Jewel would take off the proper luſtre of it.</hi> The more naked and plain divine truths appear, the more lovely they are, and do more immediately inſinuate into the heart. And if he ſaid of <hi>Tully</hi>'s eloquence, becauſe it's not ſo affected and fancifull, <hi>That he had made great progreſſe in Rhetorick, who could delight in his Latine.</hi> We may more truly ſay, he hath attained to ſome good ſufficiency in <hi>Chriſts ſchool,</hi> who ſeeth more excellency in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, than in all humane Writers. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48709:16"/>
therefore had true and ſolid wiſdome, and was alſo indowed with acquired abilities in humane learning. So that whereas Chriſt choſe fiſhermen that were unlearned; here we ſee him making uſe of one that was skilfull and learned. So that God can make uſe of all; and as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Qui dedit</hi> Petrum <hi>piſcato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, dedit &amp;</hi> Cyprianum <hi>Rhetorem.</hi> So that we may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When men of great learning and parts are choſen by God and ſanctified, they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">When men of great parts and learning are choſen by God and ſanctified, they become eminently uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their place Chriſts chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men to be Apoſtles, makes not for the chuſing of ſuch now to be publick preachers.</note> 
                  <hi>become eminently uſefull in their place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To amplifie this Doctrine, conſider, That though <hi>Chriſt</hi> at firſt did chooſe <hi>Fiſhermen,</hi> and other illiterate perſons, yet that makes nothing at all to that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtical</hi> poſition, That men abiding in their Trades, and deſtitute of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may take upon them to be publick Preachers of the Goſpel. For that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance doth rather make wholly againſt them. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Though our Saviour called them while illiterate, yet after their call, he took them into his fellowſhip.</hi> So that they were like a <hi>Colledge</hi> living together, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Head and Maſter; and thus he trained them up with himſelf for two years before he ſent them abroad to preach. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he enlarged their Commiſſion, before they did execute it, they are <hi>commanded to ſtay at Jeruſalem, where they received the holy Ghoſt in a wonderfull manner,</hi> and were inabled to ſpeak in all <hi>ſtrange tongues,</hi> and were alſo inabled to work <hi>miracles</hi> for the confirmation of their Doctrine. Now let the Adverſaries demonſtrate ſuch an <hi>extraordinary</hi> effuſion of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> on them, and we ſhall not envy, <hi>if all the Lords people can ſo propheſie.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>As ſoon as they were called at the very firſt, they left their trades,</hi> they gave themſelves to attend upon their work they had undertaken, whereas theſe plead for the retaining of their <hi>Calling</hi> ſtill; private Chriſtians then, though they are allowed to improve their gifts in a <hi>mutual edifying way,</hi> and may (if they will) find matter enough to exerciſe themſelves therein, yet they may not <hi>uſurp</hi> this Authority and Office in the Church, without a <hi>lawfull Call</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Learning whether in the arts and tongues, is an excellent qualification in</hi>

               </p>
               <p>For as <hi>Popery</hi> like a thick darkneſs did then cover the face of the whole earth, when all learning was buried, ſo when there came a Reformation in that kind, the Arts and the Tongues being more generally known, then alſo began the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion</hi> to be ſo eminent. So that if we conſider man, as he is <hi>rational,</hi> learning is his proper and peculiar <hi>perfection;</hi> and therefore far above wealth, or beauty, or ſtrength, or any natural perfection whatſoever. In the times after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when extraordinary things ceaſed, then they were <hi>learned men</hi> that God did for the moſt part raiſe up in his Church, both to govern the members thereof, and to profligate <hi>Heretiques:</hi> ſuch were <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Cyprian;</hi> of whom <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he came with the Aegyptian spoil one of Aegypt, and enriched Iſrael; by humane learning he did adorne the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It cannot be denied, but where learning hath been in any high degree, there</hi>

                  <hi>through the corruption of man, it hath been ſometimes made a weapon againſt, and an engine to promote the Devils kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inſomuch that the learned men of the world have done the <hi>Devil</hi> more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than any other men. For the <hi>Devil</hi> at firſt did not uſe an <hi>Aſſe,</hi> or any ſuch dull creature to ſeduce <hi>Eve,</hi> but the <hi>Serpent, Becauſe he was more ſubtill than any

other beaſt upon the earth,</hi> Gen. 3. 1. Thus ſtill the <hi>Devil</hi> loveth to appear in <hi>Serpents,</hi> in wiſe men, in great learned men, and plauſible Scholars, knowing that ſuch are like <hi>Samſon, That can deſtroy many at one blow.</hi> Thus all the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> they were great enemies unto the wayes of God. Who diſputed for their Idolatry, and againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but their <hi>Sophiſters,</hi> their learned men? For that word was uſed in a good ſenſe at firſt; and the reaſon is, becauſe man being naturally corrupted, <hi>and the wiſdome thereof being enmity to God,</hi> Rom. 1. 8. The more wiſdome, and the more abilities a man hath, the greater adverſary he is to God; as the ſtronger or greater the toad is, the more poiſonous he is. So that learned men, if not godly, they come out like ſo many <hi>Goliah</hi>'s againſt the people of God. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrote to a learned Heathen, <hi>Ornari à te diabolus quaerit,</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men they adorn the Devils way, and make his Kingdom and Laws to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and withall it's hard to have this <hi>talent of gold,</hi> and not to make an <hi>Idol</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it. It's hard to be learned, and not to be puffed up with it. So that whereas the way of the Goſpel, and the Scripture, is in a <hi>plain</hi> but <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>majeſtical way,</hi> they are apt to deride and contemn it; witneſs <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s confeſſion of himſelf, <hi>That he loved</hi> Tully'<hi>s works, better than the Bible.</hi> And <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us, That he was ſo addicted to humane learning, that in a viſion he was terribly beaten and afflicted, hearing this voice, <hi>Ciceronianus es non Chriſtianus.</hi> So that we grant, That many learned men are kept off from the humble and low way of Chriſt, they cannot ſtoop to his yoke, and all becauſe of their learning.

               <p>As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Not many noble men, not many rich men hath God called, 1 Cor</hi> 1. 26. But this is not, becauſe nobility, or wealth, are in themſelves ſinne, but becauſe ſuch things do many times become a ſnare to us. Learning therefore of it ſelf, and in its own nature, hath no ſuch poiſonous quality; and therefore it's a moſt irrational thing to ſay, That learning can be no more ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified than ſinne. For was it not in <hi>Paul,</hi> who as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>did ſanctifie the Poets verſes he alledged?</hi> And are not learned men, if Orthodox, and loving of the truth more able to convince the errours of the learned gain-ſayers? Have not the eminent Lights in the Church of God, in all ages, been learned men? Was not the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> learning ſanctified to <hi>Moſes?</hi> And now learning is more neceſſary ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times, then formerly. For in thoſe dayes, they were endowed with <hi>miracles,</hi> which were a ſtrong demonſtration of the infallible Doctrine that was preached, and they could ſpeak in Tongues, and ſome had the gift of interpretation, and propheſying by immediate workings of Gods Spirit; but none can now pretend to any ſuch thing. What private man could have been able to have read ſo much as one verſe in the Bible, had there not been men learned in the <hi>Original Tongues,</hi> who tranſlated it into our known Language? Neither can thoſe <hi>Miniſterial qualifications</hi> which the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in every Elder, <hi>That he be able to teach, to divide the Word of God aright, to be able by ſound Doctrine to convince the gainſayers,</hi> be performed without learning. Yea, Doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> charge the <hi>wreſting of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to their own deſtruction upon unſtable and unlearned men,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16. <note place="margin">The aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit neceſſary to an holy and ſanctified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This muſt alſo be acknowledged, That all the learning in the world cannot help us to a ſanctified and holy <hi>underſtanding</hi> of the Scripture, no, not ſo much as the true <hi>interpretation</hi> of it without the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> and if learned men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it without <hi>Gods Spirit.</hi> much leſs unlearned. Therefore we muſt not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe learning to grace, or to Gods Spirit. For how many have written Comments upon the Bible, that have been very learned men, yet from that ſweet flower
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48709:17"/>
they have turned all to poiſon, and through the corruption that was in their hearts, have made it a Book to vent all their <hi>heretical</hi> and <hi>damnable opinions?</hi> So that there muſt neceſſarily be the Spirit of God, beſides learning, Firſt, to lead us into all truth. And then ſecondly, to ſanctifie it to our own hearts in an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and powerfull manner. For men may be very Orthodox, and yet know nothing of the work of grace upon their own ſouls.</p>
               <p>Theſe things explained concerning a two-fold conſideration of <hi>Paul,</hi> as a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and as a <hi>learned man.</hi> Let us make ſome practical Uſe of it. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſee our duty, when God makes uſe of ſuch great ſinners, not to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> and revile them with their former impieties; but rather to admire the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and power of God, not to reproach <hi>Peter</hi> for his Apoſtaſie, or <hi>Paul</hi> for his perſecutions, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did <hi>Auſtin</hi> for his former miſcarriages; but to bleſs God that giveth us ſuch real teſtimonies of his grace.

Some are rigid for the negative; Yea, the <hi>Novatians</hi> of old would not admit any Chriſtian that had groſſely ſinned, though repenting, to Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Others are more mollified, and hold ſuch Miniſters, truly manifeſting their converſion and repentance ought to be received, and that as Miniſters again. But the determination of this Caſe concerning a <hi>particular perſon,</hi> would be difficult, becauſe <hi>circumſtances</hi> may much alter the matter. But in the general, we ſee Chriſt appointing <hi>Peter to feed his ſheep,</hi> though he had apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in ſo dreadfull a manner. Neither may we runne to that abſurd and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poſition of ſome, who ſaid, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> delivered a more perfect way of Diſcipline, than <hi>Chriſt</hi> did; becauſe (ſay they) <hi>Chriſt</hi> received <hi>Peter</hi> again, and gave him Commiſſion for his <hi>Apostleſhip</hi> through the whole world. In the Old Teſtament <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> are uſed as Pen-men of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, though polluted once with ſinne in a ſcandalous manner. And here we ſee <hi>Paul,</hi> though formerly a notorious ſinner, and adverſary to the Goſpel, yet is <hi>appointed by God to be a choſen veſſel to carry his name.</hi> And certainly, the receiving of ſuch after their ſerious, and publick ſatisfaction to the Church of God, or to miniſterial imploiment may be of great uſe. For hereby he will be the more induſtrious and diligent to reduce other ſinners, eſpecially ſuch as he hath been an occaſion to lead into ſinne. Thus <hi>David</hi> promiſeth, <hi>Pſal. 51. Then will I teach tranſgreſſors thy Law.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids <hi>Peter, When he is converted to confirm his Brethren.</hi> Oh what zeal and holy revenge will ſeize upon ſuch a mans heart, to make all the world ſee, that he would now ſet up the way of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he did once the <hi>Devils</hi> way, eſpecially ſuch as he hath been a means to ſeduce, and harden in ſin, over thoſe he will weep and mourn! How greatly will this lie upon his heart, ſuch it may be will lie damned in Hell, and I have been the cauſe of it? It may be ſome are now in <hi>Hell,</hi> curſing the day that ever I was a <hi>Miniſter</hi> or <hi>Paſtor</hi> to them, becauſe I encouraged, and made their hearts bold and glad in wickedneſs. Oh then, if ſuch agonies and eſtuations be in their ſouls, in what pain and travail will they be to ſnatch ſuch out of the fire, whom they have been a cauſe to thruſt in!</p>
               <p>Doth God ſometimes call even great ſinners, and that to eminent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> in his Church? Then here we ſee a notable encouragement even for the moſt prophane to hearken to theſe offers of grace. Might not you juſtly have expected, that God ſhould have made your condition as hopeleſs, as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil!</hi> Though God would out of pity, have converted ſome of mankind, yet he might have barred out all ſuch notorious and prophane ſinners as thou art.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48709:18"/>
But oh the goodneſs of God, that will not have thee to ſay, <hi>My ſins are greater than can be forgiven; I am a viler perſon than grace ever can, or will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.</hi> What? May the <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſonne not onely be received into favour, but the <hi>Father</hi> will runne and meet him, weep over him, put honour upon him? Why then doth not this kindle a fire in your bowels? Why do you not cry, even me, even me, Lord, the chiefeſt ſinner of many thouſands do thou draw to thy own ſelf?</p>
               <p>From the ſecond conſideration of <hi>Paul,</hi> be exhorted to pray to God, that <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> he would raiſe up many <hi>Pauls</hi> in his Church, godly and learned Miniſters, that by godlineſs may ſubdue ſinne, and by learning may conquer hereſies; ſuch as theſe are both <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>ſhining lights;</hi> ſuch as theſe are <hi>Stars</hi> indeed, both for the light they give, and the purity of their converſation. Happy is the Church of God, when ſuch Stars ſhine in her. If we have <hi>godly Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>not learned,</hi> then the ſubtil Papiſt and Heretick, will be ready to prevail. If we have <hi>learned,</hi> but <hi>not godly,</hi> then all holy order will beneglected, then prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impiety will lift up its head; but both together make a bleſſed Church.</p>

               <p>HItherto we have conſidered <hi>Paul</hi> under a two-ſold reſpect; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth one more obſervable thing from the <hi>mentioning of himſelf,</hi> which is not to be omitted.

by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they would not have much regarded it. So that from hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inaſmuch that</hi> Paul'<hi>s name is ſet to this Epiſtle, it is thereby of Canonical and</hi>

                  <hi>Divine Authority, and ſo ought to be received with all faith and obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles were never doubted of, except that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (which is attributed to him) as the Epiſtle of <hi>James,</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> the two laſt Epiſtles of <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation</hi> have been, but were alwayes received into the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi> Indeed there were the <hi>Elioniti,</hi> (called ſo, ſay ſome, from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word, becauſe they were <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>ſimple in underſtanding)</hi> Theſe with ſuch ſucceeding them in many opinions did reject all <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, not but that they thought they were made by him, only they rejected his Doctrine, becauſe they thought he was an adverſary to the Law, and contrary to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth about the <hi>Canonical Authority</hi> of this Book, and the reſt in the Bible, is of very great concernment, not only becauſe of the weighty contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and diſputes both of old, and alate herein; but alſo becauſe of a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical conſideration. For though men do generally profeſs themſelves to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſay, They acknowledge the <hi>holy Bible,</hi> as of Divine Authority, yet where is the man almoſt, that liveth, as if he did believe it to be a true Book? For doth any wicked man, that goeth on in his impenitent wayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Word of God</hi> to be true, that condemneth him, that forbids and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens his wayes, that tels him aſſuredly, that if it be true, and the Word of God, without reformation, he will be as aſſuredly damned, as if he were in Hell alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Can a man then believe this to be <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and yet be ſo deſperately mad, as to live in a full contrariety to it? If therefore this very Epiſtle be received as the Word of God, that it's no <hi>Apocryphal</hi> or <hi>humane Invention,</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> wrote it, as inſpired and directed by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> How can ye, how dare ye reject the counſel and admonitions contained therein, both as you are a <hi>Church,</hi> and as you are <hi>particular</hi> perſons?</p>
               <p>But to enlarge this Doctrine, conſider theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the meer prefixing of a name, though of ſome holy Authour, is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The prefixing of the name of the Author, not a ſufficient argument of it ſelf to prove the Divine Authority of any book.</note> 
                  <hi>not enough barely of it ſelf, to confirm the Divine Authority of the Scripture.</hi> For although indeed moſt of the Books both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> have their names prefixed, yet ſome of them have not, as of <hi>Judges:</hi> So in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrews,</hi> hath not the name of its Authour: But theſe are few only in reſpect of thoſe, whoſe Authours are known. All the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> begin their <hi>Prophecies</hi> with their Names, and the Authority they have by <hi>God,</hi> that greater faith may be given to what they deliver. If then the <hi>Authour</hi> of ſome Books be not known, yet if theſe Books have all thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>marks,</hi> which other Books have, for their <hi>Canonical Authority,</hi> then they are to be received as the <hi>Word of God.</hi> Therefore (I ſay) a <hi>meer Inſcription of the Name, without other ſigns, is not enough:</hi> for there are <hi>falſe Gospels,</hi> that go under the name of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> yea, there is a third Epiſtle ſaid to be of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to <hi>Seneca,</hi> are mentioned by <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> with ſome reſpect, though both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> reject them as <hi>Apocryphal.</hi> We muſt therefore beſides the Name, conſider thoſe other Arguments, which prove the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the Scripture, and ſee whether they be in it, or not. It doth appear that even in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time there were ſome deceivers, who would counterfeit Letters, as if written by <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſet his Name thereunto, to get the more Authority. This he informeth the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> of, 2 Theſſ. 2. 2. <hi>That they ſhould not be ſhaken in mind by word or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as from him,</hi> &amp;c. You ſee there were ſome, that preached the inſtant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſts coming; and they alledged <hi>Paul</hi> for it, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid ſo, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48709:19"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> wrote ſo. Hence it is that to prevent ſuch miſtakes, he doth ſo often mention his own hand in writing, <hi>The ſalutation of me Paul with mine own hand,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 21. Gal. 6. 11. Col. 4. 18. 2 Theſ. 3. 17. Phil. 1. 9. he put his own hand, as well as his own name to his Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider that Paul, and ſo all other Pen-men of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Pen-men of the Bible only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments uſed by God in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of it.</note> 
                  <hi>they were not the principal Authours, but inſtruments uſed by God, and that not in a general or common way.</hi> As when godly men make Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or write Books, <hi>but in a peculiar, and extraordinary manner;</hi> So that there could not be any miſtake or errour. This is witneſſed by <hi>Paul, 2 Tim. 3. 16. All Scripture is</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>given by inspiration. All Scripture]</hi> And although the Books of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were it may be then only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet it holds by proportion, of all that ſhall afterwards be written. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> alſo confirmeth this, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. For the Propheſe came not of old time by the will of man, but holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> The whole Word of God then, came not by mens inventions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it any deſigne in them, to make ſuch a <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> for men to walk by; but they were inſpired by God both in the ſpeaking and writing of it, ſo that both for <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>words</hi> they were <hi>infallibly</hi> guided. And therefore, though <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and others, do admit of ſome repugnancy in the holy Writers of the Bible, in matters of leſſe moment; and ſay, That this makes more to prove the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the Bible, becauſe hereby it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they did not all conſpire and agree together; yet this is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to hold ſo. For if they might erre in matters of <hi>Leſs</hi> moment, why not in <hi>greater?</hi> Beſides the Text ſaith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>All Scripture,</hi> that is, <hi>the whole Scripture in all the parts of it.</hi> So that the <hi>Bible</hi> it's Gods Book, it comes from him, he hath commanded it as a Rule, in which we muſt ſearch, and by which we are to order our lives. Oh then, with what reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſhould we receive it! There we ſee the <hi>mind of God,</hi> the <hi>will of God,</hi> who would not think that there ſhould be nothing done in the Church of God, but what is according to the Bible, the Doctrine of the Bible, the Worſhip of the Bible, the good Order of the Bible. Yea, that there ſhould be nothing done in Nations, in Cities, in Towns, in Villages, in Families, but what the Bible commands. For that being the Word of God, all Laws, all humane Authority and Power, are to ſubmit to that. And certainly, this is an infinite mercy, That in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, we may know the will of God, what he would have us to do. It's not then <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> but God himſelf whoſe Authority you deſpiſe, when you will not obey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in their writings; for they are but the <hi>Pen-men,</hi> or rather thoſe that did dictate it; for <hi>Paul</hi> had ſome others ſometimes to write his Epiſtles, as it's thought, <hi>Tertius</hi> wrote that to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Therefore becauſe he wrote that to the <hi>Galatians with his own hand,</hi> he takes notice of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 11. that thereby they might be the more earneſt againſt thoſe <hi>falſe teachers,</hi> that would bring in the <hi>Ceremonial Rites</hi> for Juſtification; yet though the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> did thus inſpire and direct the holy Writers thereof, both for matter and words, that doth not hinder, but that it was in a ſutable way to their <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Parts;</hi> Therefore there is a great difference between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s and <hi>Amos</hi>'s Propheſies in reſpect of the <hi>ſtyle,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence thirdly, <hi>Seeing the Scripture is thus inspired by God, and the Pen-men</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Scripture being inſpired by God, we ſhould reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the ſtyle and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of it.</note> 
                  <hi>were moved by him in the compoſing of it, this ſhould teach us to reſt ſatisfied in the ſtyle and method of it.</hi> For the <hi>ſtyle,</hi> becauſe it hath not the florid, and <hi>Rhetorical Ornaments,</hi> that humane Authours have, therefore ſome have diſdained it. Yea, how many had rather read ſome quaint <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Books, or <hi>Poets,</hi> or <hi>Oratours,</hi> rather than that? Oh be aſhamed of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48709:19"/>
that curioſicy and vanity of thine, if thou art not aſhamed to believe in a <hi>crucified God,</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though born in a manger! Why of ſuch a <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> that doth in a <hi>plain,</hi> but <hi>majesticall</hi> manner relate theſe things? They ſay, where mines of Gold are, there groweth little Graſs, and few Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Thus where divine and holy matter is, affectation of words, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eloquence would be a diſparagement to it. The Scripture is in a ſtyle full of <hi>Efficacy</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſutable to God, who ſpeaks it; and therefore the very <hi>Heathen</hi> could ſay, <hi>That Moſes wrote his Hiſtory like one that was of God.</hi> And for the <hi>Method</hi> alſo, that ſome are <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> ſome <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> ſome <hi>Moral;</hi> all this is from the <hi>Wiſdome of God.</hi> Therefore it's prophane arguing on <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s part, who ſaith, That if God had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Bible</hi> to be <hi>Rule of Matters in Faith,</hi> it would have been put into ſome other mould, like a <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> or ſome <hi>Body of Divinity.</hi> But what arrogancy is this, to preſcribe to the Spirit of God? And this may ſatisfie us in that Queſtion made by ſome, Why <hi>Paul</hi> did write thus in an <hi>Epistolary way?</hi> Why, it was by way of <hi>Epiſtles</hi> that he wrote, rather than in another manner? For although ſome give Reaſons, as, Becauſe it was the way of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt learned to anſwer to queſtions propounded by others. Hence we have the <hi>reſcripta,</hi> and <hi>responſa prudentium.</hi> Or, becauſe it's a more familiar way, and apter to beget love. Hence <hi>Gregory</hi> called the whole <hi>Bible, An Epistle ſent from the Omnipotent God to Mankind.</hi> Though (I ſay) theſe Reaſons be given, yet it's beſt to acquieſce in the <hi>Wiſdome of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſtians ſhould not willingly enter into thoſe Diſputes, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture not to be queſtioned or diſputed of.</note> 
                  <hi>are apt to be raiſed about the Authority of the Bible, and how we come to know they are the Books of God. Austin</hi> ſpake fully to this, when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that God had taught him, that ſuch were not to be heard, who would ſay, <hi>Unde ſeis hos libros?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How do ye know theſe Books to be from the Holy Ghoſt, and that the Authours thereof were guided by him?</hi> For this is the <hi>firſt principle of Chriſtianity;</hi> We ceaſe to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if we deny the Authority of them. So that as in all Arts, there are the <hi>prima principia,</hi> which are not to be queſtioned, and are indemonſtrable; So is the <hi>Scipture</hi> to <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> They are like the <hi>Sunne,</hi> that is viſible by its own light. And indeed it would be a vain attempt to undertake ſuch a proof to a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> ſeeing nothing can be apprehended of greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with him than the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf. Therefore the people of God ſhould ſtop their ears againſt all ſuch Diſputes. For it was the <hi>Devils</hi> way of old to make <hi>Eve</hi> queſtion the truth of Gods Word. Yet</p>
               <p>In the fifth place, Becauſe the importunity of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Heretickes,</hi> yea <note place="margin">Yet to arm our ſelves againſt the Devil, and all Hereticks, 'tis good to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. That we have as good ground to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures were written by their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Pen-men, as that any humane works were made by their Authors.</note> and ſometimes the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, who doth aſſault Gods own children; In this very point it is good to conſider theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That we have as great a teſtimony to believe that the Books of the Scripture were written by thoſe holy men to whom they are aſcribed, as we have to believe any works were made by humane Authours.</hi> That <hi>Plato</hi>'s works were made by <hi>Plato,</hi> that <hi>Tully</hi>'s works were made by <hi>Tully;</hi> thus that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles were made by him: Yea, we have farre greater reaſon, for there were <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by moſt of thoſe, who wrote thoſe Books, which could not but confirm their Authority in writing; whereas <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> theſe never wrought any miracles. Now then, if there were no more, this is ſomething, That there is not ſo much reaſon to doubt of theſe Books as made by ſuch men, then of any humane Authour that ever wrote. And as thou haſt no doubts there, ſo neither may any be made here. But</p>
               <p>

In the ſecond place, We muſt go higher, for this is but an <hi>Humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,</hi> and ſo only begets an <hi>Humane Faith.</hi> They introduce <hi>Humanity</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Hence it follows, that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein to be of God.</note> in ſtead of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who affirm, We believe that there was ſuch an one as <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> upon no higher motives, then that there was ſuch an one, as King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. Therefore this principle once granted, as it muſt be, then it will neceſſarily follow, <hi>That we muſt receive the matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as the word of God, and not of man.</hi> For this being their Writings, and they therein declaring, that they are ſent of God, and that their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is of Heaven, it muſt neceſſarily follow, That the ultimate motive of our Faith, is that <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> appearing therein. So that if this be cleared in an humane way, that ſuch men there were once, and they wrote thoſe things; as the <hi>malicious adverſaries</hi> who wrote againſt them do <hi>confeſs,</hi> then they therein declaring of whom they come, and from whence inabled, we do no longer receive their <hi>works,</hi> as we do humane works, but as the <hi>word of God.</hi> Humane Faith may make way for a Divine Faith; but this Divine Faith cannot be ultimately reſolved into it.

                  <p>What an Apoſtle was. Chriſt in the building of his Church uſed extraordinary Officers, but did not follow the Model of the Jewiſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. What were the Properties and Qualifications of an Apoſtle.</p>

               <p>THe next thing conſiderable, is <hi>Paul</hi>'s deſcription from his <hi>Office,</hi> and that <note place="margin">Why <hi>Paul</hi> cals himſelf an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</note> is, <hi>an Apoſtle.</hi> He nameth his <hi>Office,</hi> thereby to be received with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

               <p>The word <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is ſometimes uſed more largely for <hi>one that is ſent;</hi> and <note place="margin">What an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was.</note> ſo in an eminent manner is applied to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. Yea, ſome ſay, it's uſed generally for any Meſſenger; and they inſtance in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 25. where <hi>Epaphreditus</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>Philippians meſſenger,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and ſo it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Tranſlation, our Tranſlators underſtood it; but <hi>Salmaſius</hi> doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently contend, pleading alſo the conſent of the Ancients, that it's to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> never uſeth the word, but of <hi>eminent and chief Officers</hi> in the Church, ſo that he is called the <hi>Philippians Apoſtle,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>a ſpecial fellow-labourer with Paul,</hi> in planting of that Church. <note place="margin">Two kinds of Apoſtles, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary.</note> Therefore he diſtinguiſheth of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> making two kinds of them: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly inſinuateth it. The <hi>primary-Apoſtles,</hi> thoſe who were immediately called by Chriſt, being twelve in number. Or <hi>ſecondary,</hi> and theſe were ſent by the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> They were the <hi>Apoſtles Apoſtles.</hi> For ſeeing that many came in at the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> preaching, inſomuch that they were not able to manage all things themſelves, they therefore aſſumed as aſſiſtants others, whom they called <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Therefore 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 5. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. 11. we read of ſome that are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>chiefeſt Apostles.</hi> So that the name was given to others beſides the eminent twelve. And of theſe <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi> and <hi>Illyricus</hi> underſtand that place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>God had ſet in his Church ſome Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. that is (ſay they) ſome choice and eminent Teachers. But <hi>Salmaſius</hi> by theſe <hi>ſecondary Apoſtles</hi> ſeemeth to mean the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> whereas thoſe are diſtinguiſhed in that enumeration. It's enough, that others were called <hi>Apoſtles</hi> beſides the twelve, and that they were <hi>Coadjutors</hi> with them in the planting and propagating of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though he was none of the twelve immediately called by Chriſt, yet becauſe he had ſuch an extraordinary Call afterwards by Chriſt, while glorified in Heaven, which none elſe had, but he, therefore is juſtly reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48709:21"/>
with the other, and ſo accounted as the thirteenth <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> Thus that which was of ſuch exceeding rich grace, and ſo extraordinary a priviledge to <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he was not <hi>puſſed up with it;</hi> but 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. makes a new Greek word, <hi>He was leſs than the leaſt,</hi> and looks upon himſelf as an <hi>abortive,</hi> and <hi>one born out of due time.</hi> Obſerve</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Christ in the firſt planting of the Christian Church, did appoint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt in his firſt planting of his Church appointed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers, which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoſtles.</note> 
                  <hi>Officers, which he called Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as God in the firſt plantation of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and imbodied them together, did guide them and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them in an extraordinary way, which did wholly ceaſe, when they came to be ſetled in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thus did the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the beginning of his Church uſe many extraordinary things, as <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Miracles,</hi> which now have no more continuance, though the advantage of theſe doth ſtill belong to us. For thoſe very miracles, though wrought long ſince, and thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Officers are yet of ſpiritual influence. That Chriſt did appoint <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> and how, appeareth in their firſt Inſtitution of them, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 2. and this he did of large bowels, and compaſſions to thoſe whom he would ſave; They were ſent as ſo many <hi>Embaſſadours, to woe and beſeech people in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled with the Father.</hi> He did not take a way by immediate inſpiration and efficacy upon mens hearts, as he might have done. For he that could cure the dead, though he were diſtant from them, could alſo have poured his Spirit upon all fleſh, though bodily abſent from him, yet he was pleaſed to uſe this mediation of man, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſuitable and fit inſtruments for to work upon us.</p>
               <p>To improve this Doctrine, conſider</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it is obſerved by learned men, <hi>That our Saviour in the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Our Saviour in the building of his Church, did not follow the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Jewiſh.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and building of the Chriſtian Church, did not follow the Jewiſh Church Government, which was formerly appointed by God,</hi> viz. <hi>by an high Prieſt, and chief Prieſts with the Levites under them.</hi> Therefore the Officers of Chriſts Church are not to be called <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Levites,</hi> though ſometimes the <hi>Ancients</hi> call the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> ſo; but that is by alluſion onely. For, as was ſaid, our Saviour did not propound that form in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament to follow: So that all thoſe endeavours which have been uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> in Government, and Ceremonial Worſhip; as to have a <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe an <hi>high Prieſt;</hi> to have <hi>glorious veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the Worſhip of God, becauſe the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had; this is to go con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For indeed if our Saviour did follow any thing, it was the <hi>Synagogues</hi> and their <hi>Orders.</hi> Hence learned men ſhew, That the chief <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> of the <hi>Synogogue,</hi> he had his Meſſengers to go up and down to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Synagogues</hi> upon ſpecial imployment, and theſe were called <hi>Thelichin, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles:</hi> So they had two ſorts of <hi>Elders,</hi> which were made by <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> and they had <hi>Excommunication</hi> in their <hi>Synagogues.</hi> Yea, ſome ſay, both <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> were taken as Rites from the <hi>Jews</hi> then in uſe; for they had ſuch an initiation of all <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> and when they took ſuch in, they took in their children alſo: And ſo for eating of bread, and drinking of wine. Onely they adde, That when Chriſt took up theſe, he changed the nature of them: They were <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> before, but Chriſt made them <hi>Sacraments.</hi> But let the learned debate theſe things. This is enough to us, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> he did as the <hi>chief Head of his Church,</hi> chooſe ſome, whom he called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for to beginne and propagate his Church. <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore in the ſecond place conſider, That theſe <hi>Properties</hi> go to make
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48709:21"/>
an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> ſo that he could not be an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> who had not theſe <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> As</p>
               <p>Firſt, It was neceſſary <hi>that he ſhould have an immediate Call from Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. He ſhould have an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate call from Chriſt.</note> So ye read they all had. Therefore when <hi>Judas</hi> was fallen from that Office, the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did not preſume to chooſe one in his room by themſelves, but they did ſolemnly call upon God, who by lot gave direction, who ſhould be the man; and then <hi>Paul,</hi> as you heard, he was immediately called by Chriſt from Heaven, and therefore often ſaith, He was <hi>not an Apoſtle of men, or by men, but wholly and ſolely by the will of God.</hi> Thus as there were <hi>Prophets</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and ſo alſo ſome in the <hi>New,</hi> who were <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inspired by God;</hi> ſo there were ſuch who alſo had an <hi>immediate Call</hi> from God; and it was the conſideration of this <hi>Call</hi> that did ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden them, eſpecially againſt all <hi>traducers</hi> and <hi>falſe accuſers,</hi> as appeareth by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in this Epiſtle. But now you muſt know, That though the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> which in after ages have ruled in the Church, had not ſuch an <hi>immediate Call</hi> from God, but <hi>mediate</hi> by man, yet even they alſo are truly appointed of God. Even the ordinary Officers are in <hi>Chriſts ſtead,</hi> and are to be received as from <hi>God,</hi> for they have as true a Call, though not as immediate. As <hi>Abel Adam</hi>'s ſonne was as truly a man, though in an ordinary way, as <hi>Adam,</hi> who was immediately made by God. Hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to ſet in his Church Paſtors,</hi> as well as <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> This is neceſſarily to be obſerved, becauſe that we are apt to deſpiſe that Office, which hath not an immediate Call.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It was required to the Apoſtles to be the firſt builders and planters of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were to be the firſt builders of the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>Churches.</hi> Therefore they were called, the <hi>ſalt of the earth,</hi> becauſe by them God did wonderfully <hi>ſeaſon</hi> the world. They were the <hi>light,</hi> becauſe the world was in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> before they were raiſed up. So that although <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be properly the <hi>foundation,</hi> and all Churches are <hi>built on him as a Rock,</hi> yet the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We are built upon the Apoſtles.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Epheſ. 2. 20. Jeſus Chriſt being the corner ſtone.</hi> So, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 14. The <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> are the <hi>iwelve foundations.</hi> Hence Divines uſually diſtinguiſh between <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum fundans,</hi> and <hi>fundatum.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> they are a <hi>foundation,</hi> but yet need another <hi>foundation,</hi> which is the <hi>Lord Chriſt.</hi> Beſides, it's the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and not their <hi>perſons,</hi> which the Church is built upon; onely they were next to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the firſt <hi>founders</hi> and <hi>builders</hi> of the Chriſtian Church. Hence we read that <hi>Paul had the Apoſtleſhip for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and <hi>Peter for the Jews,</hi> Gal. 2. 8. And in this ſenſe <hi>Cameron</hi> hath a ſingular opinion of that place ſo much vexed by <hi>Interpreters,</hi> viz. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock will I build my Church;</hi> he underſtands it of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and that he was the ſecondary Rock <hi>(Chriſt being the chiefeſt)</hi> upon which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was built, for by his Miniſtry they were converted. But this is capable of ſeveral Objections.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It was requiſite to the Apoſtles, that they ſhould be eye-witneſſes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. They ſhould be eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of what Chriſt did and ſuffered.</note> 
                  <hi>of what Chriſt did and ſuffered, that ſo their teſtimony might be the more undoubted:</hi> And therefore even the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> though converted after <hi>Chriſts</hi> death and reſurrection, yet acknowledgeth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſeen of him alſo; but for the other Apoſtles, they were preſent with Chriſt: And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 1. 1. begins his Epiſtle thus, <hi>That which we have ſeen and felt.</hi> This eye-witneſs, and familiar converſation alſo with Chriſt is mentioned, <hi>Acts 10. 41. God ſhewed Chriſt, not to all the people, but unto witneſſes choſen before of God even to us who did both eat and drink with him.</hi> And this is that which confirmeth the Hiſtory, ſome of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, for they were preſent in the acting of thoſe things they record, and their faithfulneſs and honeſty is abundantly teſtified otherwiſe. So that although
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48709:22"/>
we did not ſee and behold what Chriſt did, and his miracles with our own eyes, yet thoſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, who are without all ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Apoſtles were univerſal Officers;</hi> they were not limitted or <note place="margin">4. They were univerſal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> fixed to <hi>particular Churches:</hi> as the Paſtors were, but the whole Church of God was their flock; Therefore they are called, <hi>the light of the world,</hi> and <hi>the ſalt of the earth,</hi> not <hi>Judea</hi> only: And thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> profeſſed, <hi>He had care over all the Churches;</hi> Therefore you ſee to how many <hi>Churches</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects his <hi>Epistles;</hi> and although <hi>Paul</hi> makes his <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> for the <hi>Jews;</hi> yet that was either by <hi>conſent,</hi> or elſe, though they did principally attend to theſe, yet they did alſo declare the <hi>Gospel</hi> to others, as it is plain in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his caſe, that <hi>Peter</hi> did preach to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, They were <hi>indowed with the Spirit of God in an infallible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. They were endowed of an infallible ſpirit.</note> ſo that while they were on earth, they were a kind of <hi>viſible infallible Judges.</hi> Whatſoever perſon or Churches did reſort to them, for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of any caſe of Conſcience, they could decide <hi>infallibly.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. though he ſaith in <hi>the point of marriage,</hi> that <hi>it was he, and not the Lord;</hi> yet that is, he had not expreſs command from the Lord, otherwiſe he was <hi>infallibly directed in that reſolution by the Spirit of God.</hi> And howſoever it be diſputed, When this Spirit of infallibity was beſtowed on them? As alſo, Whether they could grow in knowledge, or no? For it is plain at their firſt miſſion, they were not freed from <hi>Doctrinal Errours,</hi> as about Chriſts temporal Kingdom; their doubt of the Reſurrection, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance about preaching to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Yet it's moſt probable the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had this beſtowed on them in a more large manner at the Pentecoſt, and <hi>Paul</hi> at his converſion. As for that fault charged on <hi>Peter,</hi> Gal. 1. that he did not; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it was not an errour in <hi>judgement,</hi> but in <hi>fact.</hi> For although the Apoſtles were preſerved from errours, this priviledge being for the gathering of Churches at firſt, yet in reſpect of practice they might and did erre, thereby needing alwayes forgiveneſs of ſins. Only for <hi>Doctrine</hi> they could not, becauſe on them, that is their Doctrine, the Church is ſaid tobe built.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, They were likewiſe <hi>endowed with miraculous gifts, ſo that they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. They were endowed with miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts.</note> 
                  <hi>abounded in all wiſdome and knowledge, as alſo in all tongues.</hi> For God calling them to ſuch an <hi>Univerſal Office,</hi> he would not fail in beſtowing of them thoſe neceſſary means that did conduce thereunto. Not that it was neceſſary they ſhould be endowed with the knowledge of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> or ſuch other Arts, but with what was conducible to that end. Now <hi>miracles</hi> they were neceſſary, becauſe they preached that Doctrine, which was wholly new to the world, and could not be demonſtrated by Reaſon: therefore <hi>miracles</hi> were required to confirm it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, They were <hi>the chiefeſt and higheſt Officers in the Church.</hi> They <note place="margin">7. They were the chiefeſt and higheſt officers in the Church.</note> were the <hi>Starres</hi> of the firſt magnitude, theſe were next to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and yet though in ſo exalted and glorious an Office, there was one <hi>Devil</hi> amongſt them, <hi>Judas the Apoſtate.</hi> So that none have cauſe to boaſt in any Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Thoſe that are called here <hi>beatiſſimi</hi> and <hi>ſanctiſſimi</hi> by their Office may be <hi>miſrrrimi</hi> in hell.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, They were <hi>all equal in respect of Power and Authority.</hi> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">8. They were equal in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> ſaid equally to them all, <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit, they ſhall be remitted. Peter</hi> hath no ſupremacy over the reſt. They might differ in gifts, graces, and labour or work for God, and love from Chriſt, as <hi>John</hi> was beloved above all; but in reſpect of <hi>Authority</hi> none was ſuperiour to others.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, They were <hi>temporary Officers, and therefore did ceaſe with the perſons.</hi> Even as <hi>Miracles,</hi> ſo <hi>Apostles</hi> were onely for the firſt planting of <note place="margin">9. They were temporary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</note> the Church, ſo that they have no ſucceſſours in their Office. Hence it's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48709:22"/>
high <hi>arrogancy</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi> to call his, the <hi>Apostolical Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly, <hi>Though extraordinary Officers, yet they did contain what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">10. Though they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what was inferiour under them.

Lord to you.</hi> It is not we that have obtruded our ſelves, but God that hath inveſted us with this Office over you. And they alſo who hear, may ſay, <hi>We eſteem of you as the ſtewards of God; we receive you as Embaſſadors from the Lord to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To purſue this, firſt, <hi>Conſider that there are many large diſputes both in old</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Both ancient and modern Writers have much diſputed about the Call of Church-officers.</note> 
                  <hi>and later writers about the Call of Church-officers.</hi> As the truth it ſelf is ſubject to many difficulties: So the perverſe diſputes of men have made it more intricate and intangled; onely this we may obſerve, That the ſeveral parties which are in Religion that hold any <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> or ſuch an <hi>Office</hi> at all, and that by <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> (for ſome deny ſuch an Inſtitution) they ſtill <hi>monopolize</hi> and <hi>appropriate</hi> the Call to themſelves; with them onely is the true Church; with them only are the true Officers of the Church. And no doubt that way of Religion, which can ſay, with them only is the <hi>true Call,</hi> and the <hi>true Church-officers,</hi> and the right adminiſtration of Ordinances, doth infinitely excell all other waies. For Gods promiſe and ſucceſs doth accompany only his own <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> and his own <hi>Ordinances.</hi> As the people of God, will not hear a ſtranger, but flee from him; ſo neither will God go along with ſuch ſtrangers. It's only to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſours,</hi> that he promiſeth <hi>to be with to the end of the world.</hi> Therefore that Church who can upon juſt grounds ſay, that with us are the <hi>true Officers,</hi> with us are <hi>Chriſts inſtitutions</hi> punctually obſerved; no doubt but with them is Chriſt preſent, and with them is the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> This was the great advantage <hi>Abijah</hi> pleaded in his <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> againſt <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who had deviſed a <hi>new Miniſtry</hi> and a <hi>new worſhip,</hi> 2 Chron. 13. 9, 10, 11. Where he pleads, <hi>That in Jeruſalem was the true ſucceſſion of Prieſts, and there was the charge of God kept,</hi> and that <hi>therefore God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was with them.</hi> To have therefore a true Call, is of ſo great concernment, that all pretend to it. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> chargeth the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> That their Miniſters have no <hi>true Call:</hi> The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> returneth the ſame charge to them. The <hi>Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt,</hi> he ſaith, neither <hi>Papiſt</hi> nor <hi>Proteſtant</hi> have true Calls. Yea and the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> themſelves, becauſe of their different opinions in <hi>Church-Government,</hi> have alſo different opinions about the Call of <hi>Church-officers.</hi> So that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch conſequence, no wonder if the <hi>Devil</hi> keep up this controveeſie as much as may be in the Church, eſpecially if he purſue this deſigne, to make the world believe, That the faithfull Miniſters of God have no true Call: for this is to ſtrike at the very root of all. Hence it is alſo, That in the ſeveral ages of the Church there have been <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>falſe Apoſtles.</hi> Yea our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. ſaith, <hi>There will be alſo falſe Chriſts;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Devil transformeth himſelf into an angel of light,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 14. But my intent is not at this time, to diſpute the Nature of a Miniſters Call, and how you may diſcern it from falſe Calls, when you may conclude the Miniſter you live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath a true Call. For all this will be more properly handled towards the the end of this Epiſtle, when the Apoſtle is compelled to plead his Call againſt thoſe that queſtioned it.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>It's not enough to plead a Call, and that a true one, unleſs there be alſo a faithfull improving of it, unleſs the Office be executed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is not enough only to have a true Call, but that Call muſt be likewiſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the inſtitution of it. Paul</hi> doth not glory in the meer Title and Office of an <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> but ſuppoſeth alſo his <hi>faithfull dispenſation</hi> of it. Yea he was ſo carefull herein, that he profeſſeth, <hi>He knew nothing by himſelf,</hi> viz. of negligent and ill adminiſtration in this Office, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. Yea he ſaith, <hi>That he kept his body, leſt while he preached to others, he himſelf ſhould become a reprobate,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 27. <hi>Judas</hi> was an Apoſtle, yet he had little cauſe to boaſt in that Office, ſeeing he was a Devil at the ſame time. Grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſome may make it clear, that they have a Call from God, yet if they are not faithfull and diligent therein, the greater will be their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48709:23"/>
be. Suppoſe the <hi>Pope</hi> could prove (which yet he can never do) that he doth ſucceed <hi>Peter,</hi> and that in <hi>Univerſal Juriſdiction,</hi> yet if he did not ſucceed likewiſe <hi>Peter</hi> in his Doctrine, in his diligence and life, he were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable: and well did the Painter draw <hi>Peter</hi> with too red a colour, as bluſhing at the enormities of his Succeſſours. So that two things go to make a <hi>compleat Officer</hi> in the Church, his <hi>Divine Call,</hi> and his <hi>faithfull admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration thereof;</hi> and this later is neceſſary, becauſe without diligence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he cannot expect that promiſe, and aſſiſtance of God, which otherwiſe would be communicated unto him.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, let us conſider, what are the <hi>great practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal concernments,</hi> which will follow thoſe who have a true Call of God. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the <hi>Officers</hi> themſelves there are theſe encouragements: <note place="margin">What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages follow upon a true Call. 1. To the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers themſelvs 1. They may expect Gods aſſiſtance.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He may juſtly expect Gods aſſiſting of him with ſuch qualifications of zeal and courage, as are neceſſary to that work.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaking of all the <hi>Miniſters of the Gospel,</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have not received the spirit of fear, but of power and love, and a ſound mind,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 7. It's God that giveth us ſuch a ſpirit, where God calleth to an Office; there he giveth ſuitable aſſiſtance. For as it is with the <hi>general Call</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe God calleth them to holineſs, therefore he furniſheth every one with grace, without which happineſs cannot be enjoyed: So it is in <hi>peculiar</hi> ſpecial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; if in civil, he gives <hi>Saul</hi> another ſpirit, and much more in holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Hence he <hi>touched Iſaiah</hi>'s <hi>lips with a coal of fire from the altar.</hi> Though <hi>Jeremiah</hi> pleaded he was a <hi>child,</hi> yet God promiſed to <hi>enable him;</hi> And when <hi>Moſes</hi> did again and again excuſe his inability to the Office God put upon him, <hi>The wrath of God was kindled againſt him,</hi> Exod. 4. 11. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Who hath made mans mouth? who maketh the dumb, or deaf,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Have not I the Lord?</hi> If then God calleth, he can give wiſdom, mouth and ſpirit, ſuch as none ſhall be able to withſtand. Oh then, what a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupport is here! When thou art dejected under the thoughts of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency and weakneſs, thinking thou ſhalt fail under the burden, and prove a reproach to the Office: Yet becauſe God hath called thee, thou mayeſt imbolden thy ſelf, thou mayeſt ſay, Lord, I cam not hither of my own will, I am not in this place and Office by my own ſeeking, but all is of thy will and ordering, and therefore do thou own thy own ſervant. Though I am weak, thou art not: who is the Father of Spirits, but thou alone? Therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all imperfections, do thou runne unto God, who hath ſet thee in that Office.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As he may expect aſſiſtance, ſo alſo <hi>Protection and Defence in all the</hi>

                  <hi>dangers they are aſſaulted with.</hi> For it cannot be, but he that is called of God, if he do the work of God zealouſly and impartially, but he will raiſe up many enemies, and find great oppoſition in his work. Now as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour told his Diſciples of their danger, <hi>That they ſhould be haled before Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, thrown into priſons, and caſt out of Synagogues;</hi> yet he bids them, <hi>Take no thought what they ſhould ſay (viz.</hi> not in a ſinfull diſtruſtfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) <hi>becauſe at that very time it ſhould be given them, what to ſpeak, Mark</hi> 13. 11. He doth not forbid a lawfull premeditating, but that which is accompanied with ſlaviſh, worldly fears, and humane diſtruſt, as if the Spirit of God would not be ready to aſſiſt. Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> reckon up the ſeveral dangers that he was every day in, inſomuch that his ſafety was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day miraculous? Yet God delivered him out of all. He prayed to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from abſurd and unreaſonable men,</hi> and God heard him. Thus <hi>Jeremiah</hi> likewiſe, he did undertake a very difficult Province, he was to deal with <hi>Scorpions</hi> and <hi>tygers,</hi> yet <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19.

And therefore it's one of the great wonders in the world, That Chriſt hath maintained a Miniſtry in his Church for ſo many hundred years; when all the malice and policy that could be deviſed, hath been imployed to overthrow it. Yea God hath in moſt ages, ſtill ſtirred up ſome with <hi>admirable zeal and courage</hi> to withſtand the <hi>deluge of corruptions</hi> that were in thoſe daies: and though many have been violently put to death, yet ſome have been wonderfully protected, as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt, Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi>

Thus doth the Lord wonderfully cooperate with his own inſtruments; inſomuch that Divines have a Rule, <hi>Qualis vocatio, talis ſucceſſus;</hi> yet this muſt be wiſely underſtood: for as in the Scripture many precious godly women went barren, and had the reproach of not bearing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hannah:</hi> So many eminent ſervants of God, though cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him, and owned (as it were) by name, yet have not had ſuch ſucceſs in converting of ſouls, as others had. Yea Chriſt himſelf did not convert ſo many as the <hi>Apoſtles. Iſa.</hi> 49. 2. Chriſt ſpeaks notably to this, of this protection by God, yet the little ſucceſs he had. So that it's the Scriptures complaint of <hi>ſtretching out the hands in vain all the day long, to a gain-ſaying people.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The word commonly more ſuccesful to thoſe who never had it before.</note> we are to diſtinguiſh of people, for they are either ſuch as never had the Word of God preached to them; or ſuch, who though enjoying of it for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, yet have ſo univerſally apoſtatized, that a <hi>Reformation</hi> is like a new <hi>plantation of the Gospel.</hi> Now to ſuch a people as theſe, commonly the Word hath been ſucceſſefull, and multitudes have been caught in the Net of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Commonly at ſuch ſeaſons there hath been a preparedneſs made <hi>for the Goſpel to run and to be glorified.</hi> Thus you ſee the <hi>Romans, Corinthians,</hi> and many <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh places</hi> were converted from their <hi>Idols to ſerve the living God.</hi> Thus alſo among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> came as a <hi>reformer</hi> to that <hi>apoſtate people,</hi> he ſaith, That <hi>the harveſt was great, but the labourers were few,</hi> Luk. 10. 2. There were more to be converted, but no inſtruments to do it; and therefore he bids them, <hi>Pray unto God, to ſend labourers into his harveſt:</hi> As with ground new broken up, there the labourer hath the greater hopes.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, <hi>There are a people, that have long lived under the means of grace, and have often reſiſted the Spirit of God in the Miniſtry.</hi> Now <note place="margin">The Word leſs ſucceſsfull to a people that have lived long under the preaching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

In the Old Teſtament we read of two very eminent that had this name, and both of them are made <hi>Types of Chriſt: Joſhua,</hi> who lead the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> could not do it: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> brings us to Heaven, which was impoſſible to the Law; and <hi>Joſhua</hi> the <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Zechary,</hi> who being firſt accuſed, becauſe of his deſpicable garments, was afterwards covered more gloriouſly. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> our high Prieſt, in the time of his Humiliation, was condemned, and of no reputation; but in his Exaltation was magnified and exalted gloriouſly. The word thus explained, we obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Lord Chriſt is a Jeſus, a Saviour to his people.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This truth ſhould be <hi>ſweeter than the honey or the honey-comb to the loſt ſinner.</hi> Chriſt hath ſome names of <hi>terrour</hi> and <hi>dread,</hi> as when he is called a <hi>Lion</hi> and a <hi>Judge;</hi> ſome again of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> as this of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, is, <hi>In ore mel, in aure melos;</hi> not that the name, or the ſound of words is ſuch; and therefore that ſuperſtitious cuſtome of bowing at the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was not for ſome hundred of years after Chriſt, and hath no Scripture inſtitution. But the Office ſignified by name is to be cordially improved by the believing ſoul.</p>
               <p>Therefore to explain this, Conſider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It was a corrupt opinion among the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea the Diſciples were leavened with it, That <hi>Chriſt ſhould come, and be a temporal Saviour,</hi> as <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> I were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>but this ſalvation is wholly <hi>spiritual;</hi> it's from our ſinnes, from the Devils; and condemnation, which as it is the greateſt ſalvation, and none could be a Saviour, in this ſenſe, but Chriſt: So it ought to be of the greateſt eſteem with us.

               <p>Secondly, <hi>He is a ſpiritual Saviour,</hi> but not in a <hi>Socinian</hi> ſenſe, as if <note place="margin">2. He is not a ſpiritual Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our only by example.</note> he did only ſave us by example, and giving us a patern of holineſs, but not ſaving us by his blood, as a ranſome and atonement made to Gods juſtice for us. The Scripture is clear, not only to inform us of being our <hi>Saviour;</hi> but in what manner; and indeed the manner how, <hi>viz. by becoming a curſe for us, and ſuffering in our ſtead,</hi> as a <hi>Surety,</hi> doth wonderfully aggravate the love of Chriſt, and make it love unſpeakable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He is not a Saviour in an</hi> Huberian <hi>ſenſe, as if he did actually</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. He doth not actually ſave all.</note> 
                  <hi>ſave all.</hi> For he ſaith, That as <hi>Adam</hi> did actually condemn all, ſo Chriſt did actually ſave all, that is, put them into a ſtate of ſalvation, ſo that if they fall from that, and are condemned, it's a new wilfull tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own: but the Text ſaith, <hi>He ſhall ſave his people,</hi> not all from their ſins.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>He is not a Saviour in an</hi> Arminian <hi>ſenſe, as if he were a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. He is not a Saviour only habitually, or upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>only habitually, aptitudinally, or upon condition.</hi> If men did believe in him, and receive him, as a Saviour by <hi>impetration,</hi> not <hi>application;</hi> for this is to make the whole fruit of Redemption incertain, and that he might have been a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and yet not one ſaved. But</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>He is a Saviour in an efficacious applicatory manner.</hi> Thoſe that

he intentionally died for, he will ſave. This good Shepherd will find out his loſt ſheep, and not expect till the loſt ſheep come and find him, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be. They are his ſheep he layeth down his life for. It's his people he ſaveth from their ſinnes. So that thoſe of whom Chriſt is a Saviour, he will in time cauſe by effectual grace, that they ſhall come home to him, and be made partakers of the glorious benefits that flow from his death.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee in what ſenſe he is a <hi>Saviour,</hi> take notice of the <hi>properties</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It's a ſpiritual ſalvation;</hi> and therefore carnal and natural men, who feel <note place="margin">1.

The godly ſoul that complaineth of the guilt of ſinne, of the power of ſinne, of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of corruption, he it is, that crieth out, Oh let this Saviour come and ſave me! And he can the more affectionately do it, becauſe he himſelf was ſaved and delivered by God, from the cries and agonies he conflicted with. The Apoſtle aggravateth this for our comfort, <hi>Heb. 5. 7. He made ſupplications with tears unto him, that was able to ſave him from drath.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. becauſe he <hi>was tempted like us, ſinne onely excepted;</hi> we are therefore exhorted, <hi>to come boldly to the throne of grace.</hi> And hence ſome conſider that of <hi>Zechary</hi> Chap. 9. 9. where the <hi>daughter of Zion</hi> is exhorted <hi>in rejoyce greatly, becauſe her King cometh having ſalvation.</hi> (The word being in <hi>Niphal)</hi> they render it <hi>Salvatus,</hi> being firſt ſaved himſelf, and then ſaving us; howſoever this experience of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties makes him the readier to ſave us: but to whoſe heart is this truth welcome ſave to the <hi>ſpiritual Chriſtian?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>which we can be ſaved.</hi> It's high preſumption to adde other Saviours and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators to him under any diſtinction whatſoever, ſo that we muſt go to him alone.

How unwilling are men to renounce all their own righteouſneſs, to truſt in him alone, to reſt upon him only?</p>

Till (I ſay) thou art in theſe ſad agonies, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no <hi>Saviour</hi> to thee.

               <p>The ſecond Deſcription is from his <hi>Appellative Name, Chriſt,</hi> which is as <note place="margin">Of the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Name of our Saviour Chriſt.</note> much as <hi>anointed,</hi> or the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The word is uſed ſometimes generally to all the people of God, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 13. The whole body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is there called <hi>Gods anointed;</hi> and to this ſenſe <hi>Grotius</hi> brings that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. where <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to <hi>account the reproaches of Chriſt better than the treaſures of Aegypt.</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48709:26"/>
By <hi>annointed,</hi> he underſtands the <hi>people of Iſrael.</hi> But that is not ſo probable. It's more ſpecially attributed to thoſe that are chief amongſt the people of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 15. where God is ſaid to <hi>rebuke Kings for his peoples ſake,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Touch not my anointed, nor do my Prophets no harm;</hi> that is, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and others, who were in eminency of eſteem with God: He doth not mean Kings there, but his eminent ſervants. Hence it is alſo that amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> their chief Officers, <hi>Kings, Prieſts,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Prophets</hi> were <hi>anointed.</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> becauſe he did excell all theſe, being the true <hi>Triſmegist,</hi> the <hi>King, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Prophet;</hi> Therefore he was called the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or <hi>anointed one,</hi>

                  </gap> in a tranſcendent manner. Hence from <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9. 24. The <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the moſt holy;</hi> he was called the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> as if none deſerved the name but he.</p>
               <p>Now you muſt know there is a two-fold <hi>anointing,</hi> or a two-fold <hi>Oyl,</hi> which <note place="margin">In what ſenſe Chriſt is ſaid to be anointed</note> the Scripture ſpeaks of; one <hi>material</hi> and <hi>viſible,</hi> which was uſed in the Old Teſtament; the other <hi>material</hi> and <hi>inviſible,</hi> which is the Spirit of God, with the graces thereof. When therefore Chriſt is called the <hi>anointed,</hi> and God is ſaid to <hi>anoint him,</hi> Act. 4. 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> Pſal. 45. 7. And alſo the people of God are ſaid to <hi>have the anointing,</hi> 1 John 2. 27. Hence <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid, <hi>Diſce Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num nomen tuum interpretari.</hi> This is wholly to be underſtood after a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner.</hi> For as <hi>Oyl</hi> was in the Old Teſtament uſed ſignificatively, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the graces of Gods Spirit; hence every thing dedicated to God, was to be <hi>anointed;</hi> to teach us, That no approaches unto God, without ſanctification, were acceptable. So in the New Teſtament, the Spirit of God and his graces, ſtill retain the name of <hi>anointing.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> out of extream hatred to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> will not call their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they expect <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>THe <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apoſtleſhip hath been conſidered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, under thoſe two names <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We ſhall now take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them <hi>relatively.</hi> For herein doth the name of the Apoſtle breed reverence and eſteem with believers, becauſe <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf doth appoint them. So that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not make himſelf the ultimate object, into which their faith and obedience, is to be reſolved, but the <hi>Lord Chriſt.</hi> Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereby, that if they reject him, they alſo refuſe Chriſt himſelf. It is not in his own name that he cometh, neither doth he intrude himſelf into this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but he is ſent by Chriſt, and comes in his Name. Now although, when he is ſaid to be the <hi>Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we may underſtand it <hi>finaliter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his whole work and office was to advance Chriſt, to exalt him, to ſtudy and preach nothing but him, yet it is chiefly to be underſtood <hi>efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> For his meaning is, he had his Office, and his Power from Chriſt.

               <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks this fully, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20. We are embaſſadours for Chriſt, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God.</hi> What an efficacious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this for your attention and bedience? The Miniſtry is not an humane

invention; neither do we plead our own intereſt, or act in our name, but it's Chriſts intereſt, we are his <hi>Embaſſadours,</hi> we come in his Name to you. It is he that giveth us our commiſſion to preach and baptize, inſomuch that all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, contempts and rebellions that our Miniſtry meets with, for it's ſake it redounds upon Chriſt himſelf; and what is done againſt us, coming in his name is taken by the Lord Chriſt, as done againſt himſelf; <hi>He that heareth you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, and he that despiſeth you, despiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, despiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luk. 10. 16. See how hainous a ſinne it is, and how far it reacheth thus to reject thoſe who have Chriſts commiſſion to watch over a people. It is not for our ſelves, but for your good, ye ſhould know theſe things.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider the Doctrine; and to explain that you muſt know,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the learned do from the Scripture find a two-fold Kingdome</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A two-ſold Kingdom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Chriſt in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> 
                  <hi>attributed unto Chriſt.</hi> The one as <hi>he is God,</hi> having the ſame Eſſence with the Father, and ſo ruling over the whole world. The other as he is <hi>Mediatour,</hi> and <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> and ſo the chief Governour and Shepherd thereof in a peculiar manner. The firſt is called his <hi>Eſſential</hi> and <hi>natural Kingdom.</hi> The ſecond his <hi>Diſpenſatory</hi> and <hi>Donative.</hi> The <hi>Sacinians</hi> have occaſioned this diſtinction. For when we bring thoſe places, where Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>King, and Lord, to be exalted above all principalities, to prove his eternal God-head.</hi> They anſwer, This is a conſtituted God-head; Chriſt was not thus King, till after his reſurrection; and therefore (ſay they) it was given him in time, whereas if it were an eſſential attribute of God, it muſt he had from all eternity. To this it is anſwered, That <hi>Chriſt as God</hi> had right to all that glory and honour, which was given him in time; but then as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> ſo it was a reward, at leaſt a conſequent of his obedience and humiliation. So that they grant, Chriſt did in time receive a Mediatory Kingdom and glory, whereby he was made Head of his Church, and to rule in with ſupream power and authority, though from the Father; neither doth this derogate from his Deity, to ſay it was given him; for it was not given him to make him more perfect, only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Church, and it's a gift of ſuch a thing, which only can be attributed to God; for none but he that is God can be Mediatour and Head of his Church, becauſe he that is ſo, muſt be the cauſe of all the grace and ſpiritual benefits which are in the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt being thus exalted as Head of the Church, all Church-power is radically and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tally ſeated in him.</hi> So that the power to make <note place="margin">All Church-power radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſeated in Chriſt.</note> Church-officers, doth not ariſe originally from the people, as (they ſay) civil power doth, and is therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>on humane ordinance,</hi> but it cometh from the <hi>Lord Christ.</hi> Hence <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19. when Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>All power is given me in heaven and earth,</hi> then from this power, he appoints them, <hi>to go teach and baptize.</hi> Thus in another place he ſaith, <hi>John 20. 21, 22, 23. As my Father hath ſent me, ſo I ſend you, whoſoever ſinnes ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> &amp;c. From his Mediatorſhip ye ſee, he giveth the Keys of Government to his Officers. This alſo in a lively manner is affirmed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 10, 11. where Chriſts aſcenſion is ſpoken of, and his glorious exaltation, <hi>That he might fill all things,</hi> that is, appoint all things in his Church, whereupon he enumerateth all Offices, and ſheweth that they have all their Commiſſion from Chriſt, and that both, the ordinary, as well as the extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the third place, <hi>The Officers in the Church are properly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſervants to Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>to Chriſt, and receive their power and commiſſion from him.</hi> It's not the <hi>Church</hi> but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that hath ſet Officers in his Church. The Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may apply the perſon to the office, but Chriſt inſtitutes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the office to the perſon. The Church cannot make a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to inſtitute the office, for then it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48709:28"/>
other offices, then Chriſt hath, only it may deſign the perſon. For Chriſt is the fountain of all Church-power, and officers receive their authority from him. It's true, that the Apoſtle ſaith to the Church of <hi>Corinth, All things are yours,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 5. And in another place, <hi>We are your ſervants for Jeſus ſake;</hi> but the meaning therof is miniſterially; their office, and the execution, that was wholly for the Churches edification, not that they had their power from the Church. For who can think that <hi>Paul</hi> had his authority from men, when he diſclaimeth it ſo often, yet he reckoneth himſelf in the number of thoſe that are ſervants for their ſpiritual benefit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Although it be diſputed, Whether the power of appointing Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Laws in the Church belongeth to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or a <hi>King.</hi> Some <note place="margin">This power of appointing Officers and Laws in the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Chriſt as King</note> ſay, as a <hi>Prophet</hi> he doth thus govern his Church, yet <hi>it is more probable that be doth this as a King:</hi> So that Chriſt as a ſpiritual King over his people, doth appoint what officers, what Ordinances and Orders he pleaſeth: ſo that you muſt know that this is part of Chriſts <hi>Jus regale,</hi> and they come equally from the ſame fountain, both to appoint an Officer and an Ordinance. The Church can no more appoint a new Office, than it can a new Ordinance, a new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is greatly to be obſerved, becauſe the Governours in the Church, or the civil Magiſtrate for politick conſiderations have inſtituted new Offices, and many times made the Government of the Church, ſutable to that of the Commonwealth, equalizing ſpiritual Officers with Civil; but this may be no more done, then to appoint a new Ordinance; and the reaſon is, becauſe both <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> are for ſupernatural effects, to convert, to build up in grace. Now none may appoint any thing for ſuch high ends, but thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who are able to accompliſh them: Chriſt only can convert, therefore he only can appoint an Officer, or Ordinance for converſion: Beſides, to appoint new Officers, would redound to Chriſts diſhonour, as if he were not either wiſe, or able enough to appoint all things in the Church neceſſary to attain ſalvation, whereas the Apoſtle preferreth <hi>Chriſt</hi> above <hi>Moſes, That he was but as a ſervant, but Chriſt as a ſon in the houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation;</hi> firſt, To the <hi>Church-officer.</hi> Doth he come with <hi>Chriſts</hi>

This ſhould daily lie upon our hearts, To what end have I this Office from <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Is it not to labour in his vineyard? Is it not to convert ſouls? Do not all the names, which Church-officers have, imploy labour, work and diligence? Eſpecially theſe things they muſt take heed of:</p>

               <p>The ſecond thing obſervable from this <hi>relative conſideration</hi> is, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">

This was a greater glory</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome) then if he had ſtyled himſelf any temporal Officer in the Civil State. For he doth</hi> (ſaith the ſame Father) <hi>as if one next to the Emperour ſhould write to a certain people, giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that title of honour, which was next to the Emperour.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Paul, The Apoſtle of Jeſus Christ.</hi> This could not but aſtoniſh and ſtartle all his oppoſers and enemies, yet if you do conſider, with a worldly reſpect, what Chriſt himſelf was, and ſo any Officer under him, you muſt judge it the moſt contemptible and deſpicable thing that can be, that which a carnal man would have been aſhamed to own; for <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf was called, The <hi>Carpenters ſonne,</hi> and bred up at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a moſt deſpicable place; and his outward condition was ſo low, that he ſaith, <hi>He had not where to lay his head.</hi> And as for his Apoſtles, what repute they had in the world, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf telleth us; when he ſaith, <hi>They were accounted the off-ſcouring of all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 13. Yet ſee how the Apoſtle glorieth in this title, as that which might juſtly awe the conſciences of thoſe to whom he wrote. From this obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thoſe things are of high account and respect in the Church of God, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Thoſe things are highly eſteemed in the Church, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by the world: As</note> 
                  <hi>in the world are very despicable and deſpiſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As, <hi>That which is highly eſteemed amongst men, is abominable before God,</hi> Luk. 18. So that which is abominable and loathſom before men, is highly eſteemed with God.</p>
               <p>We might inſtance in many things,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt who is the Head of the Church, and the chief corner-ſtone, yet he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The perſon of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>by thoſe, who by their Office was builders:</hi> Yea, <hi>Christ crucified was accounted fooliſhneſs to the Gentiles.</hi> Inſomuch that had not God promiſed <hi>Chriſt, To give him the Nations of the Earth;</hi> and had actually lifted him up, <hi>above all principalities and powers.</hi> We ſhould have thought, there would not have been one City, much leſſe one Nation, eſpecially not ſo many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons adoring him as God: We may truly ſay, <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes. Chriſt</hi> is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> which 2 <hi>Tim. 5. 16. Druſius</hi> ſaith, was the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Style of the great Kings of <hi>Perſia;</hi> but who, except the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> would admire Chriſt more than the <hi>Perſian</hi> King?

found in a mean place at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and in the meaneſt place there, but where God giveth ſpiritual eyes, there is a ſpiritual excellency diſcovered, where the world ſeeth nothing but contemptibleneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>For the Officers of Chriſt.</hi> In worldly conſiderations, how low <note place="margin">2. The Officers appointed by him.</note> and deſpiſed are they? But to thoſe who are ſpiritual, and acknowledge the Order and Inſtitutions of Chriſt, they eſteem them, as the <hi>Stewards of God,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers of Chriſt,</hi> inſomuch that it's the cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning Religion, when their Office is deſpiſed. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo received by the <hi>Galatians,</hi> as if he had been <hi>an Angel from Heaven;</hi> Yea, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; <hi>They would have pulled out their eyes to have pleaſured him.</hi> And we ſee in the after ages of the Church, how much the Miniſters of Chriſt were had in eſteem, inſomuch that it greew unto an exceſſe. Now though the carnal, worldly man beareth no ſuch reſpect to them, yet thoſe, who are led by Scripture, doe highly eſteeme them, and that for their workes ſake.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Paul</hi>'s own particular, he is often affected with this <hi>grace of Apoſtleſhip,</hi> as he cals it, which was vouchſafed to him, whereas he had been the chiefeſt of ſinners. And leſt it ſhould be thought, that <hi>Paul</hi> indeed might well attribute his Office, and all to Gods grace, becauſe he was ſo notorious a ſinner you may read that Chriſt ſpeaks to all his Apoſtles, that he alone not for their merits, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

them to that Office. <hi>Joh. 15. 16. Ye have not choſen me, but I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us illuſtrate this Doctrine. And <note place="margin">We have all Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges from the meer will of God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Every priviledge we have in the Church of God, we obtain it by the meer will of God.</hi> And this muſt needs be ſo, for our call to the Church-priviledges, ſuch as Juſtification, and Adoption, and Salvation, are greater and higher mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than any peculiar Office never ſo eminent. If God hath called thee to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace in an effectual manner, this is far greater than to be made an <hi>Apoſtle. Judas</hi> was choſen to an <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> but not to ſalvation, and therefore his end was dreadfull.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſpeaketh of a <hi>two-fold Call,</hi> That <hi>general</hi> one, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs <note place="margin">There is a two-fold Call, the one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the other particular, both which come from God.</note> to all the people of God, who are <hi>his called ones,</hi> and that <hi>according to his purpoſe;</hi> and a <hi>ſpecial particular Call</hi> to ſome Office or Relation; and both theſe are of <hi>the will and good pleaſure of God.</hi> For our <hi>effectual Calling</hi> as Chriſtians, This is frequently aſcribed to be of <hi>grace, not by works we have done,</hi> Rom. 9 15, 16. <hi>It's not of him that willeth.</hi> You ſee, it's not our <hi>will,</hi> our <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>ſtrength, but of God that willeth.</hi> Thus <hi>Jam. 1. 18. Of his own will begat he us.</hi> This conſideration then ſhould humble all the godly, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here, <hi>An Apoſtle by the will of God:</hi> ſo mayeſt thou, a <hi>Believer by the will of God,</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>will</hi> of God; it's becauſe God will have it ſo; my <hi>will,</hi> my <hi>power,</hi> nor the <hi>will</hi> of any man elſe, could not effect it for me. And this is for the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> as we are called to be believers.</p>
               <p>But then more eſpecially, concerning <hi>Gods will,</hi> as to <hi>particular Relations and Offices, especially in Gods Church.</hi> It is good to take notice of that old di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, <note place="margin">A four-fold diſtinction concerning the Call of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers. 1. Some are called only by the will of God, not at all by the will of man.</note> which <hi>Hierom</hi> had long ſince, concerning the Call of Officers in Gods Church. For there are ſome (ſaith he) that were <hi>called only by the will of God, and of Chriſt, not at all by the will of man.</hi> Thus were the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Officers by the meer will and appointment of Chriſt. And therefore <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. we ſee in what a ſpecial manner <hi>Paul</hi> was an <hi>Apoſtle by the will of God;</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>He was neither an Apoſtle of men, or by men, but of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> nor <hi>of</hi> men, that is, he was not choſen by their votes and ſuffrage; nor <hi>by</hi> men, that is, he was not as the ordinary Paſtors, who though called of God, yet were made ſo by men, as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> ordained Elders in every City where they had to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are thoſe who have their Call of God, but by men,</hi> ſuch as we now <note place="margin">2. Some have their call of God, but by men.</note> mentioned. For though their <hi>Call was partly by the will of man,</hi> yet not <hi>ſolely.</hi> Therefore God is ſaid 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. to ſet theſe <hi>ordinary Officers in the Church,</hi> as well as <hi>extraordinary.</hi> As <hi>Joſhua,</hi> though appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to be chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was as truly of God, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> though not ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There are thoſe who are of men only, but not of God;</hi> and they are all ſuch, <note place="margin">3. Some are of men only, not at all of God.</note> who by unlawfull and ſinfull wayes get into the Miniſtry, and ſo have an outward Authority and Office, though they be wholly unworthy, and unfit in themſelves. Theſe are indeed by the <hi>will</hi> of God; but it is a <hi>permiſſive will</hi> onely, or by his juſt anger againſt an unworthy people.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There are thoſe, who have neither Call from God, or men; that are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Others have their call nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God nor men.</note> 
                  <hi>Preachers neither by the will of God, or of men, but their own ſelf-will.</hi> Theſe are intruders, that approve themſelves, that judge themſelves fit without the advice of others, <hi>Theſe run and are not ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us conſider how comprehenſive this is, when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>An Apoſtle by the will of God,</hi> and it is not uſeleſs: for every Miniſter ought to ſay ſo, I am a Miniſter of the Goſpel <hi>by the will of God;</hi> and the people ought to ſay, Such an one is our Paſtour <hi>by the will of God.</hi> It is God that had a ſpecial hand that he ſhould be our Paſtor, and we his flock. And</p>

1. <hi>It is more than a meer bare will of permiſſion. Paul</hi> did not mean Gods meer permitting and ſuffering of him to be ſo, for thus all the falſe Apoſtles, all <note place="margin">In what ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> here ſaith, <hi>By the will of God.</hi> 1. It is more than his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive will.</note> the falſe and corrupt Teachers that are, they are by the <hi>will</hi> of God. It was by <hi>Gods will</hi> that any unworthy and corrupt Teachers have ever crept into the Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. There muſt be hereſies,</hi> God will have it ſo; but how? It is only his <hi>permiſſive will,</hi> whereby he ſuffers ſinne to be. It was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom that ſome Church-officers had to ſay, They were ſo <hi>permiſſione divinâ,</hi> by divine permiſſion, as thinking themſelves unworthy, only God ſuffered it to be ſo. Even as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſtyled himſelf <hi>vocat us Abbas,</hi> as if he had only the name, not the reality: but it is well, if this was not proud humility. To be ſure as God ſometimes ſuffers evil Governours in Civil Affairs, ſo he doth alſo in Church-adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul is an Apoſtle not by Gods juſt and angry will, raiſing him up for the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It is not his angry and juſt will.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinnes and puniſhment of a people; but it was from Gods good pleaſure.</hi> And this conſideration is very terrible; God hath not only a <hi>permiſſive will,</hi> but a <hi>juſt ordaining will</hi> of <hi>evil and ungodly Officers</hi> at ſome times, to ſome people, for wiſe and holy ends, God in great anger doth <hi>will</hi> ſuch <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> to <note place="margin">God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth juſtly ſend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters amongſt a people.</note> a people, that ſhall be <hi>blind guides,</hi> that ſhall be <hi>thieves and robbers,</hi> that ſhall be <hi>ravening wolves,</hi> and ſhall lead many to <hi>hell with themſelves.</hi> Sad and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the condition of ſuch a people. See a notable place for this, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 22, 23. where God is deſcribed as a juſt Judge ſitting upon his Throne, and an hoſt ready to wait on him. Now there was wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> who deſired ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that would ſpeak no evil to him, that would flatter him, and thereupon ſee what God ſaith to the <hi>lying Spirit,</hi> he bids him <hi>Go, and be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all the Prophets, and he ſhall perſwade and prevail.</hi> Thus the Lord ſtill doth. There are many people love not a Miniſter, that will reprove ſinne, that will promote godlineſs and holineſs; but let them have a man, that will let them be at eaſe in their ſinnes and formality. Now God in his juſt anger, and by his <hi>provoked will</hi> brings ſuch a Miniſter to ſuch a people: You would have ſuch, and God will have you have ſuch, <hi>and they ſhall perſwade and prevail.</hi> To this purpoſe alſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30, 31. Now this will of God in ordering ſuch Officers, is ſometimes to increaſe the condemnation of the Officer himſelf, and to draw out his ſins more. They are Officers in the Church through the anger of God to themſelves; they will gnaſh their teeth that ever they were entruſted with ſuch power, for thereby they become more wicked. Had not <hi>Judas</hi> better have been the pooreſt wretch in the Church of God, then ſuch an eminent Officer? It is ſometimes alſo for the wickedneſs and ungodlineſs of a people; and therefore even thoſe that are godly, who live under ſuch <hi>providential Miniſters</hi> (I call them <hi>providential Ministers,</hi> becauſe they are ſo by his <hi>providence in anger,</hi> not by his <hi>approving will)</hi> they are to conſider two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To bleſs and praiſe God, that the <hi>lying Spirit in the Miniſter hath not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on thee;</hi> that he hath not led thee into the ditch, that his poiſon hath not fallen on thee: Oh admire Gods goodneſs herein! And withall</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>Humble thy ſelf under Gods hand.</hi> It is his <hi>will</hi> it ſhould be ſo, as yet the <hi>providence</hi> of God doth manifeſt him offended with ſuch a people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The will of God doth imply, that</hi> Paul <hi>was not an Apoſtle by chance or meer hap, but that there was a directing hand of God in it.</hi> And certainly ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration <note place="margin">3. It was by the directing will of God, not by chance</note> would much imbolden <hi>Paul;</hi> for as he was <hi>by the will of God made an Apoſtle,</hi> ſo by the ſame <hi>will</hi> he ſhould continue, and be preſerved in the ſame, notwithſtanding all oppoſitions whatſoever. And thus all the godly Miniſters of the Goſpel find the <hi>good will</hi> of God towards them, that they were at firſt ſet apart for that function, or by ſome providence of God brought to deſire it. They may find many times a <hi>peculiar will</hi> of God, that ſometimes when their friends would have it otherwiſe, yet God would have them Miniſters. And thus
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48709:31"/>
alſo for their deſignation to ſuch a people. How many times are great diſcoveries of <hi>Gods will,</hi> that where there was no likelihood, yet God would have him Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor to ſuch a people? It is of great uſe both for Miniſter and people to obſerve the <hi>ſpecial will of God.</hi> For as in civil relations of husband and wife, there God many times diſcovers a <hi>peculiar will</hi> of his bringing them together, which made the Wiſeman ſay, <hi>Riches were an inheritance, but a wife was the gift of God.</hi> Riches and an inheritance are alſo the gift of God; but thoſe relations are in a more peculiar manner of him. And it is good for thoſe that are in ſuch relations to quicken themſelves by meditation on the <hi>will of God,</hi> that brought ſuch things about, beyond all expectation, or humane providence. Thus alſo it ought to be in ſpiritual relations: Oh it is good to lay to heart, how the will of God hath been, that thou ſhouldſt live under a powerfull Miniſtry, it may be all thy life time, and it hath been denied to others, who often have ſought to God for ſuch a mercy. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 6. You may there read, that <hi>Paul</hi> while in his travails preached the <hi>Word</hi> every where where he came, yet <hi>was forbidden to preach in Aſia;</hi> yet at the ſame time at the ſixth verſe, <hi>There ſtood a man, and cried, Come over into Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and help us.</hi> See how the Spirit of God <hi>like the wind bloweth where it liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> commandeth <hi>Paul</hi> to one place, and forbiddeth him another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It implieth, <hi>That it was no merit or deſert in</hi> Paul, <hi>which advanced him to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. It implieth, it was not <hi>Pauls</hi> merit, but Gods will that advanced him to this office.</note> 
                  <hi>this Office.</hi> For as believers, <hi>John</hi> 13. are ſaid, <hi>Not to be born of the will of men, or of the will of the fleſh, but of God,</hi> which takes all from man, and giveth all to God: So it is in this work of the Miniſtry; it is not becauſe men have parts, or learning, or holineſs, that God ſets them apart for ſuch an Office, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. God tels <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 1. 5. <hi>That he had ſanctified him from the womb,</hi> that is, ſet him apart to be his Prophet; and this was before any good at all could be in him. And this alſo <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf acknowledgeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15. where he ſaith, <hi>He was ſeparated from the womb.</hi> And obſerve, how both the work of grace, and his <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> came together; and the fountain of all is made Gods pleaſure, <hi>When it pleaſed God to call me.</hi> Thus you ſee, that thoſe who are raiſed up to be ſerviceable in the Church, have all from God, both <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>Potentia</hi> and <hi>Poteſtas,</hi> as they are ſometimes diſtinguiſhed. Hence it is that this <hi>will of God</hi> doth not reach only to the appointing of him to his Office, but the inward preparing and fitting of him for that work. Thus you ſee that all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a good Miniſter is comprehended in this, That he is ſo <hi>by the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you may ſay, <hi>What if a Miniſter ſhould at firſt enter into this Office</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Concerning thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Miniſtry only upon carnal and corrupt motives.</note> 
                  <hi>meerly by the inſtigation of a corrupt will? Nothing at firſt made him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Miniſtry but hopes of preferment, and getting a livelihood in the world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, It is indeed a moſt bleſſed thing, when it is with a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> as with <hi>Paul;</hi> he was made an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> at the ſame time, when God did alſo inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his grace to him: when from the youth the workings of ſanctification, and zeal to convert ſouls, hath put them upon the Miniſtry; but where ſuch <hi>corrupt principles</hi> did prevail, and were the only motives to be a Preacher of the Goſpel, there muſt be great humiliation for them: and no doubt many godly Miniſters of the Goſpel have <hi>greatly bewailed</hi> their <hi>ſinfull entrance</hi> into the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> that they had only <hi>corrupt and carnal motives ſtirring them up thereunto;</hi> and when this is done, no doubt God will accept of their labours, and they be made the more zealous for God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation,</hi> both to <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to ſtudy and meditate more <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> upon the <hi>will of God</hi> in theſe things. Am I a <hi>Miniſter by the will of God?</hi> Are theſe my flock by the good pleaſure of God? Was it of God, that I was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſet apart for this work? This will be a great Goad both to duty and comfort. And</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle doth in ſeveral Inſcriptions in his Epiſtles likewiſe name this <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> not that he helped <hi>Paul</hi> in compoſing of them, but partly for <hi>Timothies</hi> encouragement, to ſhew the good eſteem he had of him. As <hi>Nazianzen</hi> (if my memory fail not) in his <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> upon <hi>Baſil,</hi> declaring the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that was in him, ſaid, <hi>If</hi> Baſil <hi>had lived in</hi> Paul'<hi>s time, he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed his name in his ſalutatory Prefaces, as he did</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Sylvanus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And partly becauſe <hi>Timothy,</hi> as to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had a peculiar relation. For 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 17. Paul</hi> had ſent him to them, to put them in remembrance of their duty; and it ſeemeth, being now returned again unto <hi>Paul,</hi> he informed him of the Churches eſtate there.

               </p>
               <p>So that we may attribute this to that great humility which was in <hi>Paul,</hi> that though ſo eminent and tranſcendent in Office and grace above all others, yet is pleaſed to make others ſit (as it were) upon the Throne with him, and not to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate all things preſumptuouſly to himſelf. Indeed the Popiſh Commentators, they inſtance in the Pope, that he calleth other Biſhops <hi>Brethren;</hi> but all know, that what title ſoever he may uſe, yet he claimeth an <hi>univerſal Juriſdiction</hi> over them. But in <hi>Paul</hi> it was otherwiſe. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the truly godly, though eminent in Office and Graces, yet are exceeding</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> though an Apoſtle, eſteemeth of <hi>Timothy</hi> as a <hi>brother,</hi> though in other reſpects, he was his <hi>ſonne, begotten by his Miniſtry.</hi> The truly godly, and the wicked, they are diſcovered by their ſpirits. The ſpirit of pride and ambition is in all corrupt teachers; And therefore when <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk was ſent over
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48709:32"/>
by the Pope for the converſion of <hi>England,</hi> as they call it, the Monks that were then in the Land oppoſed him, concluding he had not the Spirit of Chriſt in him, becauſe he was ſo full of pride and lordlineſs; but all the true Officers of Chriſt, they are endowed with that Spirit which Chriſt himſelf had. Now the <hi>holy Ghoſt deſcended in the form of a Dove upon him.</hi> And he bids <hi>all learn of him, for he was lowly and meek.</hi> Hence he tels his Diſciples, <hi>That he will not any more call them ſervants but friends.</hi> Yea after his reſurrection he ſaith, <hi>Go tell my brethren.</hi> The Apoſtle aggravateth this great condeſcenſion of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11. That <hi>though he was the only Sonne of God, yet he humbled himſelf to become man,</hi> and ſo was not aſhamed <hi>to call believers brethren.</hi> Therefore there cannot be a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inſtance of this humility and condeſcenſion then was in Chriſt himſelf. Now all the godly they are followers of Chriſt in this, as well as in other reſpects; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo much that it is a certain qualification in all the godly, that though God hath never ſo much above others, yet they become condeſcending to the loweſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: Even as Chriſt himſelf diſdained not the leaſt that came to him. Hence you have that command, <hi>Mind not high things; but condeſcend to men of low eſtate,</hi> Rom. 12. 16. Even the pooreſt and meaneſt that are godly, are to be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and nouriſhed by thoſe that are more eminent. The head muſt not deſpiſe the foot, becauſe both are in the ſame body. Hence alſo at the tenth verſe in that Chapter, you have a paradoxal exhortation, <hi>In honour to preferre one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> How can that be? Even becauſe there is no godly man, though never ſo excellent, but a weaker and meaner Chriſtian may exceed him in ſome things. Thou haſt more gifts, more abilities, but it may be another hath more ſincerity than thee. Beſides, every godly man, though in the higheſt form, is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe infirmities and corruptions that are in his own heart, which he thinketh ſuch, though far inferiour to him, are not guilty of; and hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that duty of <hi>preferring one another</hi> amongſt the godly.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider, <hi>Wherein this humility in godly ſuperiours doth diſcover it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wherein the humility of the godly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf to their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</note> 
                  <hi>ſelf to inferiours.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is evident in that they dare not take that honor to themſelves, which others looking upon them as far above them are apt to give them, when it's not convenient or proper for them.</hi> This certainly is a great diſcovery of an humble ſpirit, when they do even tremble at thoſe praiſes and reverence, yea reject and refuſe it, when it is immoderate. How often are inferiour Chriſtians ſo dazelled with the luſtre of thoſe admirable gifts and graces which are in ſome ſuperiours, that with <hi>John</hi> to the <hi>Angel,</hi> they are ready to make a god of ſuch, and ſet them up too much, ſo as to <hi>worſhip</hi> them? But the more godly any ſuch <hi>ſuperiours</hi> are, the more they refuſe it. We ſee this notably in <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 10. 25, 26. when <hi>Cornelius</hi> fell down at <hi>Peters</hi> feet, and worſhipped him; <hi>Peter</hi> took him up, ſaying, <hi>Stand up, I my ſelf alſo am a man;</hi> and at another time when the <hi>Barbarians</hi> would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> accounting them as gods, with what fear and trembling, rending their cloaths at ſuch blaſphemy did they come and forbid them? <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 15. Thus you ſee, let the godly be never ſo admirable in gifts and graces, yet they will not take more than is due to them. Certainly, if the <hi>Angel</hi> forbad <hi>John,</hi> deſirous to worſhip him, ſaying, <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant, worſhip thou God;</hi> how much rather may every man, though the chiefeſt of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſay, I am your fellow ſervant, I am ſubject to ſinne and infirmities as well as you; praiſe God therefore, and give glory to God. As the Apoſtles when they had cured a lame man, ſaid, <hi>Why do ye look upon us, as if we had done it by our own power?</hi> So the godly when inabled to preach wonderfully, to pray ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably, or perform any gracious acts above others, they ſay, Look not upon us, but upon God. What an admirable expreſſion of humility is that in <hi>Paul? 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 16. where he is afraid any ſhould think of him above that he ſeeth, or heareth to be in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48709:32"/>
Secondly, The humble condeſcenſion of the godly to others, is ſeen, <hi>In their bearing with their infirmities, and weakneſſes in their underſtanding.</hi> Though they have not ſuch quick abilities, ſuch inlarged capacities, as others have, yet they do not reject them or deſpiſe them. This counſel <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4. giveth to the ſtrong Chriſtian, <hi>That he ſhould not judge, or deſpiſe the weak:</hi> Was not this admirable in Chriſt himſelf? How weak and ſlow of underſtanding were his Diſciples, though they had been ſo long under his Doctrine? yet for all that he diſdaineth them not, but he is ready upon all occaſions to give them further inſtruction. And <hi>Paul,</hi> though indeed he doth ſharply reprove ſuch, as having great oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of knowledge, yet were <hi>carnal and babes ſtill,</hi> as he ſpeaks to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> yet for all that he doth not caſt them off, but uſeth all means to promote them to further perfection. The eminenteſt men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to the loweſt capacities, where they ſind godlineſs and an humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to learn.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Their humble condeſcenſion is ſeen, <hi>In the acknowledging and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing at the graces and gifts which they ſee God beſtoweth upon others.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> how often doth he profeſs his praiſes unto God, and continual thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings in the behalf of them he writeth unto for this particular? Yea they heartily deſire ſuch growth in grace, and ſuch plenty of abilities and gifts, though it ſhould be to the overſhadowing and eclipſing of them: Even as <hi>John</hi> ſaid about Chriſt with joy, <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe,</hi> John 3. 3. And as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Would all the people of God might propheſie,</hi> Num. 11. 23. So can they ſay and delight in ſuch gifts that God ſhall give to others, though <hi>inferiour.</hi> It's a great ſinne, and high pride in <hi>Superiours,</hi> to envy, and to look with an ill eye, upon the gifts which God may beſtow upon thoſe that are not of their <hi>rank.</hi> Not that ſuch who have no gifts, ſhould preſume as if they had; or thoſe that have gifts, ſhould intrude upon publick preaching, before the examination and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others. To diſlike this, is not to envy the gifts and graces that are in others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Their humble condeſcenſion is ſeen, <hi>In deſiring the prayers, and the communion even of thoſe, who are farre below them.</hi> Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> often deſire the <hi>prayers</hi> of thoſe he wrote unto, though he was an <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> yea he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be with them, <hi>that he may be comforted by them.</hi> There is no <hi>godly man,</hi> let him have never ſuch <hi>extraordinary gifts,</hi> and <hi>great enjoyments</hi> of God, yet he needeth the <hi>prayers</hi> of the <hi>meaneſt</hi> of Gods children; yea and by their <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> may obtain a great deal of good. They may learn the practice of ſeveral gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and be much quickned up by them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Their humble condeſcenſion is ſeen, <hi>In the compaſſionate restoring and reclaiming of ſuch who have gone aſtray.</hi> There is a weakneſs of parts, and a weakneſs of graces. Now when ſome through this latter weakneſs, have been overcome by temptations, they do not ſuperciliouſly and ſcornfully reject ſuch, but labour in a <hi>spirit of meekneſs</hi> to <hi>recover</hi> them. <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf is a <hi>preſident</hi> for this, when he compareth himſelf to the <hi>Shepherd</hi> that went and fetched the <hi>loſt ſheep</hi> home upon his own <hi>ſhoulders.</hi> As alſo to that good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who <hi>poured oyl</hi> into the <hi>wounds</hi> of that <hi>wounded paſſenger</hi> to <hi>Jericho.</hi> This counſel the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> gives ſuch as are <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> Gal. 6. 1. <hi>To reſtore ſuch as are fallen in the ſpirit of meekneſs.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, with what <hi>tears</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> did he bewail ſome <hi>Corinthians</hi> that had defiled themſelves?</p>
               <p>If you ask, <hi>What grounds there are, why the godly, though thus exalted by God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Why thoſe who are ſo exalted above others, are yet ſo humble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</note> 
                  <hi>are yet humble to others?</hi> The Reaſons are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe they are humbled towards God, and ſuch muſt needs be humble towards men.</hi> They have theſe grounds to humble them Godwards.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſenſe of all that iniquity which formerly they have committed, or for the preſent they do commit.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> from the conſciouſneſs of his former impieties
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48709:33"/>
did till his death go halting with the apprehenſion of his <hi>former miſcarriages.</hi> They are eaſily kept <hi>low to others,</hi> whom God keepeth <hi>low to himſelf.</hi> This le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie upon them will make them aſhamed. Though God hath ſet them on the <hi>Pinacle of the Temple,</hi> yet they have <hi>corruptions</hi> as others; they feel infirmities in themſelves, as well as there are in others. Yea in the general, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to the meaneſt acts of ſervice, that may promote the ſpiritual welfare of others. The Diſciples wondered to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> talk with a woman, <hi>John</hi> 4. thought it below his greatneſs, as a Prophet to do ſo; but he ſaid, <hi>It was his meat and drink to his Fathers will,</hi> even in that particular. Thus at another time, <hi>He waſhed his Diſciples feet,</hi> to teach them humility.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are humble towards God, and ſo towards men, <hi>Becauſe all they have is from the gift of God, it is he alone that maketh the difference.</hi> The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. ſpeaketh enough to keep the beſt man in the world, though he had the gifts and graces of Angels, low and humble in himſelf. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what haſt thou that that thou haſt not received?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. If then all they have cometh ſolely from Gods gift, he calleth to an office, he alſo giveth abilities, then they cannot glory in themſelves, but walk humbly with God in all things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are humble under Gods hand, <hi>Becauſe they do not adde at all to God.</hi> He doth not need any mans parts, or gifts, and therefore he paſſeth by many, and will never make uſe of them, who yet if God had pleaſed might have been far more ſerviceable than thou art. For did not God reject the Angels, who by their intellectual natures and agility thereof, might have done God more ſervice than thou canſt do? Yea the ableſt man may look upon all the ſubtil Hereticks, all the learned men, that have in all ages been promoters of the Devils Kingdom, and then ſay, <hi>Who hath made me to differ from theſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, They are humble towards God, <hi>Becauſe by how much the more God hath lifted them up, the more talents he hath beſtowed on them, the greater muſt their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be.</hi> So that there is more cauſe of trembling and humiliation under all emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies and gifts, then any tumor or puffing up. For they are more liable to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere account, and if they miſcarry their condemnation will be greater. Thus you ſee what cauſe ſuch have to be humbled towards God, and where that is, there will be an humble condeſcenſion to others.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, A godly man, though exceeding eminent is humble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, <hi>Becauſe the meaneſt godly man, is heir of the ſame glory, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the ſame ſalvation with him.</hi> So that if you conſider them alike in Chriſt there is no difference, God reſpecteth them alike. <hi>In Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>there is no bond, or free, but all are one in Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 21. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that <hi>Maſters</hi> are exhorted, <hi>To do that which was equal to ſervants, that were believers, becauſe they had the ſame Lord.</hi> Only you muſt know, that there is a true humility and a counterfeit one; Grace doth not put upon the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the former. For a counterfeit humility makes a man puſillanimous, not keeping up the due authority of his place and office. The Apoſtle, though ſo humble, that he judged himſelf <hi>leſs than the leaſt of the Apoſtles,</hi> yet ſaith, <hi>He would magnifie his Office,</hi> and he pleadeth for it againſt all oppoſers whatſoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> To diſcover our ſpirits, how we are when exalted to any Office, or enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> by any gifts: Are not we who are apt to charge pride in others, guilty of a great deal our ſelves? We look upon thoſe that are higher with a cenſorious eye, not conſidering that there are many under us, who meaſure out the ſame judgment to us Take then the Apoſtles adviſe, <hi>Be cloathed with humility;</hi> the Greek word is <hi>rarely,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 5. uſed. This ought to be a garment all over us; nothing but the ſpirit of humility ſhould breath and live in us. And indeed this is the way to be made higher ſtill. <hi>For God giveth grace to the humble; and the humble he will teach his way.</hi>

                  <p>There is a great deal of difference betwixt the Perſons whom God calls, and alſo in the manner of his calling them. Education under godly Parents not to be reſted upon, but our Hearts are to be ſought into, whether they be really changed, or no.</p>

               <p>VVE are upon the <hi>Perſon conjoyned</hi> in this <hi>Inſcription;</hi> and that is <hi>Timothy,</hi> who is likewiſe inſcribed in the <hi>Preface</hi> in ſeveral other <hi>Epiſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have thought that becauſe of this conjunction of him with <hi>Paul,</hi> that therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> did aſſiſt <hi>Paul,</hi> in making and compoſing of ſome Epiſtles: But that is not probable. He doth it (as you heard) to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Timothy,</hi> and alſo hereby manifeſting his modeſty, and humble conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion.</p>
               <p>We have then the <hi>Perſon deſcribed</hi> by his name, <hi>Timothy;</hi> and by his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Brother.</hi> Not in a large ſenſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes cals all believers <hi>Brethren,</hi> but in a ſpecial reſpect, becauſe of his Office he was in, though at other times he cals him <hi>Son;</hi> of which in its time.</p>
               <p>Let us firſt conſider his <hi>Name,</hi> and ſo his <hi>Perſon;</hi> and then his <hi>relation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His name is <hi>Timothy,</hi> as much as <hi>one that is for the honour of God;</hi> and ſo indeed he proved in an admirable manner inſtrumental thereunto. We may read of what parents he came, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 1, 2. his <hi>Father</hi> was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and an <hi>Infidel,</hi> but his <hi>Mother</hi> a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> woman, and one that <hi>believed.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. gives a great commendation of his <hi>Grandmother</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> and ſo to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as if their faith had been <hi>hereditary.</hi> For although his <hi>Father</hi> was a <hi>Gentile,</hi> yet becauſe his <hi>Mother believed,</hi> ſhe took ſo much pains with him, as that he <hi>knew the Scriptures from his youth up.</hi> Inſomuch that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was a great benefit to have godly Parents, especially to have a godly Mother;</hi> becauſe the mother, if holy, hath many opportunities to inſtill holy principles into the children, while young. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks much of the <hi>inſtructions,</hi> which his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> gave him.</p>
               <p>Concerning this <hi>Timothy</hi> therefore, two things are obſervable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he being educated in an hopefull, godly way from his youth, and for the <hi>good report</hi> that he had in the <hi>Church</hi> of God, as appeareth, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 2.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48709:34"/>
As alſo becauſe of ſome <hi>Propheſies</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Revelations,</hi> what an uſefull inſtrument he would be in the Church of God, <hi>Paul</hi> took a great affection to him; and made him an Officer in the Church, while he was a young man. So that <hi>Timothy</hi> was in reſpect of his condition clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Paul; Paul</hi> a <hi>perſecuter,</hi> a <hi>blasphemer,</hi> an <hi>enemy,</hi> and that for a long while; but <hi>Timothy hopefull,</hi> and a <hi>diſciple from the youth up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſervable is, That though <hi>Timothy</hi> was thus brought up with <hi>godly Parents,</hi> and ſo knew the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from his <hi>youth.</hi> And as <hi>Calvin</hi> thinketh, becauſe of that expreſſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. where he <hi>was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the unfeigned faith that was in Timothy,</hi> as well as his <hi>Mother,</hi> that it doth relate not to <hi>Timothy</hi> at that time, who was no doubt an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent believer, but to his infancy or younger yeares, yet that ſeemeth not coherent with that which <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith in another place, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 2. where, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> cals <hi>Timothy</hi> his own <hi>Sonne</hi> in the faith, he ſaith, <hi>That Paul was his spiritual Father in begetting of him to Chriſt.</hi> It is therefore diſputed, Whether <hi>Timothy</hi> was not converted from his youth, or by <hi>Paul</hi>'s miniſtry afterward, as he did <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> while in bonds? Some think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cals him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>his germane, or ſincere Sonne,</hi> not <hi>spurious,</hi> that he was the means of his converſion; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. he ſaith, <hi>He had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Corinthians by the Gospel.</hi> Others ſay, becauſe he was ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in the Chriſtian faith, and ſo hopefull, <hi>Paul</hi> took him for a companion, and much delighted in him; and therefore <hi>Timothy</hi> a young man was ſerviceable to <hi>Paul,</hi> aged in propagating the Goſpel; as a ſonne to the father: and this the Apoſtle inſinuateth upon a large commendation of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> Phil. 2. 22. Others they think, That though <hi>Timothy</hi> might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from his youth, yet <hi>Paul</hi> did further inſtruct and convert him in the things of Chriſt, and ſo it was equivalent to a converſion. Now all theſe three reſpects may be allowed of, and have their ſeaſonable matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>But let us firſt conſider, The great difference between <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>convert,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> a <hi>convert;</hi> one from his <hi>younger years</hi> a <hi>blasphemer,</hi> an <hi>high ſinner;</hi> the other a <hi>diſciple,</hi> and <hi>unblameable in his life;</hi> then obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there is a great difference both in the perſons, and the manner of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">There is a great deal of difference both in the perſons that are converted, and in the manner of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> 
                  <hi>converſion of thoſe, whom God is pleaſed effectually to call, and to make uſe of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are not of the ſame condition or qualifications, that God calleth; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they brought home in the ſame manner. This Doctrine hath its great uſefulneſs, as will appear.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider the various conditions, and then the different manner of their converſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Some are great and notorious ſinners:</hi> Others again, are of a <hi>more civil and ſober life.</hi> Some have from their youth up been kept from all groſs ſinne, as <hi>Joſeph, Daniel, Obadiah,</hi> and our <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Text. Others again have been very foul and ſcandalous, as <hi>Paul, Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and divers of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Thus God cutteth down ſometimes crooked trees, and ſometimes ſtraight, and makes his ſpiritual building of them. God can turn a barren wilderneſs into a pleaſant ſpring, <hi>He can raiſe up children to Abraham out of ſtones.</hi> God is free in the work of grace, and ſo takes ſometimes a great ſinner, and ſometimes ſuch as are unſpotted in their wayes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a great difference ſometimes <hi>in their conſtitutions; ſome are of a more fierce and cholerick temper; others again of a more mild,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48709:34"/>
and meek temper. Moſes,</hi> he is ſaid to be the <hi>meekeſt man that was upon the earth:</hi> But <hi>Elijah</hi> ſeemed to be a man of more fire and paſſion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Apoſtles, <hi>John</hi> diſcovers himſelf to be a man of much <hi>love,</hi> as he was alſo much <hi>beloved;</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> appeareth to be a man of more <hi>zeal,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>inordinate heat,</hi> as when he ſtruck off <hi>Malchiu</hi> his ear. Thus all the godly are not of the ſame conſtitution and temperament; ſome are <hi>more paſſionate cholerick;</hi> others <hi>more mild</hi> and <hi>temperate,</hi> yet God he chooſeth of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There may be difference in their externals; Some are rich, others poor; ſome are great in place and office, others are mean and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</hi> For although 1 <hi>Cor. 1. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Not many noble, not many wiſe, not many rich hath God choſen,</hi> yet ſome he hath, though not many. Yea, thoſe that have been by their callings greatly ingaged to ſinne, and to act againſt Chriſt, yet even of ſuch God hath called ſome; ſome of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> yea ſome of the <hi>Priests</hi> that were the moſt proſeſſed enemres to Chriſt, are yet ſaid to <hi>believe in him.</hi> And thus in times of <hi>Reforneution</hi> from <hi>Popery,</hi> although <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>In the Monaſteries and Frieries there was greater oppoſition to the Goſpel, than in the very Ale-houſes and Brothel-houſes;</hi> yet <hi>Luther</hi> himſelf, and ſome others were Monks. Yea, as he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Inſaniſſimum Monachum,</hi> mad in doting upon Popiſh opinions, yet God converted them.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee a world of difference in the <hi>Externals</hi> of thoſe that God cals; We might alſo adde the <hi>Difference in reſpect of their Vicinity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity.</hi> God cals ſometimes out of a <hi>wicked Family,</hi> a <hi>wicked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> a <hi>wicked place,</hi> where there is none elſe ſcarce that minds any thing that is godly. In <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s houſhold there were ſome that believed; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you have a <hi>Child</hi> converted, when <hi>Parents</hi> and all the <hi>Kinred</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate enemies to God: Sometimes again, you have <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and all godly, as it was with <hi>Timothy,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Gods converſion of his people is in a different manner.</hi> Some have been in an <hi>extraordinary manner,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> and many in the Primitive times: Others in the <hi>ordinary way</hi> of the Word; ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ave had more ſtrange and remarkable paſſages to convert them than others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some have <hi>more deep humiliation, and greater terrours upon them than others.</hi> As ſome children are born with more pain and difficulty than others. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> he was greatly humbled in his ſpirit, and brought low, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican ſeemed to be converted, without ſuch deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his heart. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> likewiſe had great humiliation and bitterneſs of ſpirit, elſe ſhe could not have wept ſo abundantly as to waſh Chriſts feet. But we read of <hi>Lydia,</hi> when God <hi>opened her heart,</hi> that ſhe deſired to entertain the Apoſtles, and diſcovered not ſuch commotions of ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is great difference ſometimes in the <hi>continuance, others are lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the birth,</hi> they have many conflicts, ſometimes they are even entring the Haven; and then ſome violent ſtorms drive them back again. Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>That he had many troubles on his heart, and had many reſolves and prayers againſt his ſinnes, yet ſtill he gave back again, and would procraſtinate, he would weep and pray, but ſinne again, till at laſt God brought him out of the wombe of ſinne, and he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more to his vomit.</hi> Others again, as many we read of in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, were immediately wrought upon, and with all gladneſs received Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is variety in the occaſions, and in the time.</hi> In the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48709:35"/>
one affliction hath been an occaſion to ſome ſuch or ſuch a correction upon them; a wife may ſometimes be an occaſion to her husband, or an husband to a <note place="margin">Why God is pleaſed to call ſuch different perſons, and in ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way.</note> wife: Yea, a maid-ſervant was to <hi>Naaman</hi> both an occaſion of his ſoul and body's health likewiſe. And thus for <hi>time</hi> likewiſe, ſome are converted <hi>ſooner,</hi> and ſome <hi>later;</hi> onely you muſt know, that though there may be this difference, yet in theſe things all agree.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the work of grace is wrought <hi>invincibly and irreſiſtibly in all.</hi> There are none that by their own power, or free-will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to differ from others, all are paſſive in the work of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though afflictions may be an occaſion and a motive, yet it's the word of God that is the only ordinary means of our converſion.</p>
               <p>Now the Reaſons why God uſeth theſe various diſpenſations to all ſorts, may be,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To ſhew the freeneſs of Grace.</hi> For if one ſort of perſons onely be converted, it might be thought ſome merit or deſert were in them, which was not in others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hereby likewiſe God ſheweth, <hi>That he doth not need any.</hi> It's not becauſe he wants ſuch, that he converts them, for if ſo, then only great men and learned men would be converted.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It might be, that none of any rank ſhould deſpair; and therefore the command is 2 <hi>Tim. 2. That we ſhould pray for all, becauſe God would have all to be ſaved;</hi> that is of all ſorts, whether <hi>Kings,</hi> or <hi>Governours,</hi> who were then moſt unlikely, becauſe the greateſt enemies to Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Doth not God keep then to one way in reſpect of the perſons and manner of converſion? Then this ſhould teach every godly man, <hi>Not to make his converſion a meaſure of others;</hi> unleſs they have been humbled and wrought upon in ſuch a meaſure, and with ſuch kind of temptations, we are apt to judge harſhly of them. Now although every one that is regenerated is brought to ſee himſelf loſt and undone, and thereby to believe in a Saviour, yet the meaſure of ſorrow, and degree of humiliation may be in one, more than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe 2. Of Direction to the people of God,</hi> that in theſe various diſpenſations of Gods grace, <hi>They ſhould mutually conſider one another.</hi> Doth God chooſe thee a meek mild man, grudge not, or cenſure thoſe, who are rough and of a more paſſionate diſpoſition? But let all the children of God admire the grace and power of God, that doth ſubdue all things to himſelf. And though thou mayeſt not have that temptation or infirmity in thee, which thou judgeſt in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet thou mayeſt have another corruption of another nature: So that the conſideration of this, ſhould breed great love amongſt the godly, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one be provoked to give glory unto the grace of God, which is all in all.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Doctrine is gathered from the neceſſity, if not of converſion, yet of that which was almoſt equivalent to <hi>Timothy,</hi> though enjoying very godly education. And from thence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That none are to reſt upon their godly education under godly parents, but</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">None are to reſt upon their godly educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but all are to ſearch their own hearts, to ſee whether they be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or no.</note> 
                  <hi>they are to conſider whether the work of Grace hath ever been wrought in them or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> (as you heard) thought <hi>Paul a ſpiritual Father to Timothy,</hi> and that he was converted by his Miniſtry, though of ſuch excellent education; and all agree, That whatſoever ſeed of grace he might have in his younger years, yet
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48709:35"/>
there was a more perfect and compleat informing of him by <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly to open this, Conſider</p>
               <p>Firſt, That it cannot be denied, but <hi>that ſome may be converted from their youth;</hi> that they have had the holy fear of God upon them, ever ſince they were able to underſtand any thing. 1 <hi>King. 18. 12. Obadiah</hi> told <hi>Eliſha, He feared the Lord from his youth.</hi> And thus <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt did partake of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> while he was in his <hi>mothers womb:</hi> and it is a moſt bleſſed mercy thus to have our ſpiritual and natural life together: They are preſerved from thoſe wounds that others go halting with to the grave. Yet</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>They are not to reſt upon this, who have lived civilly from their youth, and followed their good education.</hi> For good Education is one thing, and Regeneration is another thing. The one is but external, and maketh onely an outward Reformation; but the other is internal, and makes a ſpiritual change, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 20. We read of one, <hi>He had kept all the commandments from his youth;</hi> who ſaid, he ſpoke according to his education and inſtruction. For the <hi>Phariſees</hi> taught, That the Law required no other obedience then what is outward. Now he had kept himſelf from any outward pollution, or groſs tranſgreſſion. But we have a remarkable inſtance in King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 Chron. 23. 2. <hi>Jehoiada</hi> a godly man brought up that King in a godly manner, and he did that which was right all the while <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada</hi> lived, but when he died, than he hearkned to the counſel of others, that were the means of his ruine. Therefore conſider, whether thou haſt any more then the remnants of good education upon thee; in time of temptation thy rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs will be diſcovered. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Grant that thou haſt received grace from the very womb; yet know, <hi>That upon thy growing up, the world will make a great change and alteration upon thee.</hi> For they were but the ſeeds and initials of grace, it's the word of God that muſt further compleat and perfect thee. Therefore that illumination, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſanctification, which thou ſhalt be partaker of, will be (as it were) a new thing to thee, thou wilt think thy ſelf to have been in the dark, and to have known nothing comparatively to what now thou doeſt. So that although we are not to puzzle and perplex the godly, with the knowledge of the time when and where; and how they were converted, as if that were neceſſary; yet we are to find that God made a change upon us; we are not what we would have been by nature; we find God making thoſe tender plants, or that little muſtard-ſeed to grow up into a large and great Tree.</p>

                  <p>How much it concerns Church-Officers to agree in matters of Religion. What meanes may conduce to it. Univerſities and Nurſeries of Religion, of how great uſe they are to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>

                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 1.</bibl>
                  <q>And Timothy our brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WE are now to take notice of the ſecond Deſcription, that <hi>Timothy</hi> is adorned with, and that is a <hi>brother</hi> to <hi>Paul.</hi> He is called a <hi>brother,</hi> not in a large ſenſe, as all believers likewiſe are, but becauſe of a ſpecial relation, he being alſo a Church-officer, though in an inferiour degree to <hi>Paul.</hi> And he ſtyleth him <hi>brother,</hi> not only from his humility and low condeſcenſion: Of which already; but alſo to ſhew his conſent and agreement with <hi>Paul</hi> in all thoſe things treated of in the Epiſtles. As he calls him <hi>Brother,</hi> ſo he often uſeth the compellation of a <hi>Sonne,</hi> becauſe he was not only the inſtrument, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of converſion, or further inſtitution of <hi>Timothy</hi> in the wayes of Chriſt: but becauſe in the miniſtration of the Goſpel, <hi>Paul</hi> was a father to him, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting him how to manage his miniſterial imployment; and therefore he writeth two Epiſtles to him, which he doth to none elſe; and all are to direct and guide him in his Office. So that it was <hi>Timothy</hi>'s great happineſs to have ſuch a <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was, and to be brought up at his feet, as he was at <hi>Gamaliels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two profitable Obſervations deduceable. Firſt, In that <hi>Paul</hi> calls him <hi>Brother;</hi> hereby ſhewing their conſent and agreement in the matter deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the conſent and agreement of Church-officers in religious matters is of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The conſent of Church-officers in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is of great uſe and moment.</note> 
                  <hi>great uſe and moment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have written one thing, and <hi>Timothy</hi> another, or the clean contrary, this might have occaſioned great diſtraction amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not knowing what to believe, or which way to take. Conſent is ſo great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or unity, that the <hi>Roman</hi> party makes it a note of a true Church, although they cannot greatly glory in that note.</p>
               <p>To underſtand this,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>There is a moſt perfect and abſolute conſent and agreement, and that not only in matters of Religion, but alſo in all civil ordinary things.</hi> So that all the Officers of the Church have the ſame <hi>velle,</hi> and the ſame <hi>nolle,</hi> which the Heathen ſaid was true friendſhip indeed. Now ſuch a conſent as this, is not to be expected in this life. That glorious priviledge will be in Heaven, where not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48709:36"/>
only ſeveral ſects and opinions ſhall ceaſe, but alſo there ſhall be no more diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in their wils and affections. The Apoſtolical Church could not be thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. For we read of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> twice contending, who ſhould be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt amongſt them? and this came from pride and carnal affections: afterwards we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 39. of a <hi>paroxyſme,</hi> or a ſharp contention between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which was ſo great, that they departed one from another, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had been companions in a fruitfull manner to publiſh the Goſpel of Chriſt. If ſuch ſpots can be found in theſe Sunnes, no wonder if they be in the Moons, the leſſer lights of the Church. Yea <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. there we may read of an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and that was not indeed about a doctrinal matter of Religion, but in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which did relate to Religion: for there <hi>Paul reſiſted Peter to the face, and blamed him before them all.</hi> Thus you ſee, that though there were none, but <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Barnabaſſes,</hi> none but <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Peters,</hi> and ſuch eminent Apoſtles in the Church of God, yet we could not look for ſuch an abſolute and perfect concord, that there ſhould not be the leaſt difference in any thing. The Church never was, or will be like the upper region, that is not moleſted with the leaſt turbulent vapour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a full conformity or agreement in the ſubstantials and neceſſaries of Religion; and alſo in all the acceſſories and circumſtantials therein.</hi> And this is the next perfect Unity to the former; and this was in the <hi>Apoſtolical Church.</hi> Thoſe that were the true Officers of Chriſt, had no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence either in Doctrine or Church-government, or worſhip of God; but they were all unanimous, as farre as may be obſerved. Indeed <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1. we read of ſome <hi>Phariſees</hi> who were ſaid to believe, That they taught <hi>a neceſſity of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and obſervation of Moſaical Rites to the converted Gentiles,</hi> which made a very great rupture and ſchiſme in the Churches, while newly planted. And although there was a Councel gathered together to ſtop this breach, and Decrees made to regulate the Church herein, yet it ſhould ſeem that their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Intereſt did not pluck up this diviſion by the root. For <hi>Paul</hi> in ſome of his Epiſtles, makes this his great doctrinal ſcope, to eſtabliſh them in their Chriſtian liberty; but for the Apoſtles themſelves, and the faithfull Officers in the Church, they ſeemed as to teach the ſame thing, ſo to walk in the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and wayes of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is a conſent and agreement in the eſſentials, and fundamentals of holineſs; but difference and hot diſſentions in thoſe things, that are</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>or</hi> circa-<hi>fundamentals, as alſo in matters of Diſcipline and Government.</hi> Now although we maintain againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> That by the good bleſſing of God, all the Reformed Churches (excluding <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp;c.) do agree in the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to ſalvation: yet it muſt be likewiſe granted, That in reſpect of acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, there are ſad diviſions, and wofull rents in the Church of God. The name of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as alſo of ſeveral forms of Government, do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that there is a great breach amongſt us. And this we muſt expect to have alwayes in the Church, as long as men are ſubject to ignorance, miſtakes, and carnal affections. And therefore we are not to be offended and ſcandalized at it, much leſs hearken to Popiſh Emiſſaries, who take this advantage amongſt weak people, to perſwade them, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is therefore the only true Church.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, let us conſider what are cementing and uniting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; what do conduce to Unity amongſt the Officers of God in his Church. <note place="margin">What are thoſe things that conduce to Unity amongſt Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, That which is alwayes willing to be laſt is <hi>Humility,</hi> and a <hi>ſpirit of meekneſs</hi> and <hi>moderation.</hi> You never heard of an humble man, that he was a diſturber of the Church, or broacher of hereſies. Hereticks have alwayes been proud, haughty and ambitious men, as <hi>Marcion, Neſtorius,</hi> and others, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48709:37"/>
the Pope of <hi>Rome, who exalteth himſelf above all that is called God.</hi> Were then men of more humble and lowly ſpirits, having low apprehenſions of their gifts and abilities, this would wonderfully make to conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Earneſt and ſervent prayer unto God for the holy Spirit.</hi> For ſeeing it's the Spirit of God that is promiſed to <hi>lead us into the truth;</hi> And Officers of the Church have a more peculiar promiſe for it above ordinary belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as being in a more peculiar Office, and receiving a proper Commiſſion from Chriſt: It is therefore neceſſary to implore this aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit. For whereas the <hi>Papiſt</hi> doth ſcornfully, and with deriſion ask, <hi>How comes it about, that ſeeing every Sect in the Proteſtants, doth lay claim to the</hi> Spirit of God, <hi>all owning it to be their guider in their ſeveral wayes? How comes it about, that yet theſe ſpirits are ſo contrary to one another? Can the holy Spirit of God be oppoſite to it ſelf?</hi> To this calumny it is eaſily anſwered, That all Officers and Teachers, do not equally, and in the ſame meaſure partake of <hi>Gods Spirit.</hi> For beſides that, there is not now any ſuch meaſure of it given to any Officers in the Church, that makes them infallible; There is an inequality and difference in the degrees of partaking of this <hi>holy Spirit of God,</hi> ſo farre as it is communicable. Some have it more in the gift of illumination; ſome more in the gift of ſanctification; and withall ſome are more negligent and faulty than others. And therefore the holy Ghoſt is not communicated to all alike. For pride, negligence, want of ſervent and earneſt prayer, makes the Spirit of God to keep off from us. Oh then, that all who have inſpection in the Church of Chriſt, were more earneſt for <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> that he would enlighten us, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us; howſoever that he would ſo ſanctifie us, that if we did erre, yet we ſhall not be obſtinate and pertinacious in it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>An uniting principle is to take heed of ſelf-will and ſelf-conceit, to make our wils and humours, or apprehenſions, the Law and Rule of truth.</hi> The Apoſtle amongſt other qualifications in an Elder requireth, <hi>Tit. 1. 7. That he be not ſelf-willed,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one that pleaſeth himſelf, or is ſelf-conceited of his own abilities. For all herefies and diviſions are bred in the womb of this ſelf-conceit: and commonly the more ignorant, and the leſs knowing, the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and ſelf-conceited. For the more knowledge any man hath, the more he apprehends his own weakneſs and ignorance; he alſo ſeeth the ſtrength of ſuch arguments, which one of a ſhallow capacity can no more reach unto, than a <hi>Pigmy</hi> can the <hi>Pyramides.</hi> More principles might be offered unto you, but I have ſpoken to this at large from <hi>John</hi> 17. where our Saviour prayeth over and over again for unity amongſt believers, as if it were the only pillar of all ſound Doctrine, and true holineſs. Only the uſefulneſs of this agreement is ſeen in the good influence that it will have upon the body of believers; a divided Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, will alſo make a divided people. If thoſe bright luminaries of Heaven, ſhould oppoſe one another, as the Moon doth ſometimes the Sunne, what ſad Eclipſes doth it produce? We read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. that amongſt theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> there were heavy diviſions, though that ſeemed to be the peoples ſin moſt, who made ſuch a difference, one ſaying, <hi>I am for Paul,</hi> another, <hi>I am for Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Uſe be, To us all to importune God, who is the <hi>God of peace,</hi> and who alone can faſhion the hearts and minds of men alike, that he would bleſs the Church with this Unity. Oh how greatly would godlineſs flouriſh, errours be diſcouraged, if it could be ſaid, of all believers, which is ſpoken of the primitive Chriſtians often, <hi>That they met together with one accord, and with one heart!</hi> Oh how bleſſed is it to ſee the whole Church of God, rather than one family, or City to dwell together in Unity!</p>
               <p>The next thing obſervable is, in that <hi>Timothy,</hi> who is here called a <hi>Brother,</hi> is at other times very often called a <hi>Sonne.</hi> And beſides the Reaſons inſiſted on the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48709:37"/>
laſt day, there is another mentioned, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 22. that <hi>Paul</hi> was as a <hi>Father</hi> to him, inſtructing of him about his Miniſterial Office, and therefore had two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties wrote to him for the managing of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical affairs</hi> in a godly manner. This great help and tuition (as it were) <hi>Timothy</hi> had from <hi>Paul,</hi> being made a Church-officer, while he was young. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is of great conſequence to ſuch who in their young years are ſet apart for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is of great uſe to young to have the guidance of ſolid and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</note> 
                  <hi>the Miniſtry to have the guidance of thoſe who are more ſolid and experienced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, though he could have immediately furniſhed his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> with admirable and ſufficient abilities for the great work of Apoſtleſhip, yet kept them two years, as the <hi>Harmoniſts</hi> gather, under his peculiar charge and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. In the Old Teſtament likewiſe, though the gift of propheſie was by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſpiration, yet we read that even then there was the <hi>Colledge of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and the <hi>ſons of the Prophets,</hi> 2 King. 2. 7. So we read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 22. of the <hi>Colledge of the Prophets.</hi> Hence it is alſo in the New Teſtament, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle directing of <hi>Timothy,</hi> how to keep up the ſound Doctrine of Chriſt after his departure, giveth this notable inſtruction, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 2. That what Doctrine he had heard from Paul, he ſhould commit to faithfull men, that ſhould teach others.</hi> That is a very full and pregnant Text. For the uſefulneſs of <hi>Univerſities,</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>Nurſeries,</hi> wherein young ones ſhould be trained up to deliver the ſound Doctrine to their Poſterity after them. Though in thoſe primitive times there was ſuch a plentifull effuſion of the Spirit of God in the gifts thereof, yet he there commands, <hi>that faithfull men ſhould be choſen,</hi> who ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to poſterity, one age after another, the true Doctrine of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the primitive times, before there were Univerſities, the Biſhops houſe was a Nurſery to train up young Diſciples. And in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time, he began to be a <hi>Catechist,</hi> and to ſet open a School in reference to the Chriſtian Religion. If there be in ſuch publick Nurſeries and Univerſities, groſs abuſes, men degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into lazineſs, and not fulfilling the general intention of the Founders, the abuſers are to be purged away, but not the order or manner of education it ſelf. If it be ſaid, The the Spirit of God is that which alone inableth a man to ſuch Offices and Imployments. We grant that the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is the alone Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of all gifts and abilities; but yet now the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth not work in an immediate and miraculous manner, elſe why is there not working of Miracles? Why do they not ſpeak in all Tongues? Why do they not underſtand <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which are the original Languages the Scripture was written in? If therefore we muſt not look for the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in ſuch an immediate way, it muſt be in a mediate and acquired way. And this ordinary way doth not exclude <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> but ſuppoſeth it. For if in thoſe days, when miraculous gifts were ordinary, yet ſee what charge <hi>Paul</hi> layeth upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> to give himſelf to <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtudying of the Scriptures;</hi> eſpecially that is obſerved by <hi>Calvin,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 13. <hi>Till I come, give thy ſelf to reading;</hi> he would not have him ſo much as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that little time. No wonder if in theſe later days ſuch duties are more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently to be preſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation to you that are people;</hi> to be of more <hi>publick spirits</hi> in your prayers, not only regarding your preſent age, but that the truths of God may be handed from age to age; that the Univerſities may be pure fountains, and hopefull Nurſeries, from whence may come ſuch, who ſhall be able to propagate the pure Doctrins of Chriſt. <hi>Peter</hi> was carefull that after his deceaſe the pure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins of Chriſt might be preſerved. And ſo for your children, and childrens ſake, that they may not live in times of ignorance and darkneſs, importune God earneſtly, that he would keep up ſuch faithfull men and good wayes, that may propagate the Goſpel to the worlds end.</p>

               <p>FRom the <hi>Perſons inſcribing,</hi> we come to the <hi>Perſons inſcribed,</hi> or to thoſe to whom this ſalutatory Preface, and ſo the whole Epiſtle is directed; and that is ſet down, 1. More particularly, and then more generally. More particularly; and they are deſcribed by the relative condition and eſtate they are in, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Church [To the Church]</hi> which is further deſcribed <hi>topically</hi> from the place where it is, <hi>At Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us conſider this particular firſt. And for the opening the word <hi>Church,</hi> we might ſpend much time therein; but I ſhall briefly explicate it.</p>
               <p>The word is uſed, and that only in <hi>Act.</hi> 19. for a <hi>Civil Aſſembly.</hi> Yea, it's <note place="margin">What the word Church is uſed for in Scripture.</note> ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Aſſembly was confuſed.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their publick meetings <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; The word is uſed in <hi>Thucidides,</hi> as the learned obſerve. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath two words <hi>Cohel,</hi> which is for the moſt part tranſlated <hi>Eccleſia</hi> by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and <hi>Gnedeth</hi> which is tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>the Church,</hi> doth rather anſwer <hi>Cohel,</hi> than <hi>Gnedeth,</hi> becauſe under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it is not fixed. As for ſuch who would underſtand that place, <hi>Mat. 18. Tell the Church,</hi> of a <hi>Senate</hi> or <hi>Civil Power,</hi> it's ſo improbable, that it's not worth time to confute it. The word therefore is moſt frequently uſed in the New Teſtament, for <hi>an holy Society gathered together in an holy manner for holy ends.</hi> And thus it is uſed either for the <hi>Catholick, inviſible Church,</hi> which is the whole body of Chriſt, that ſhall be ſaved, as when he is ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. To <hi>give himſelf for his Church; and the Church is made the wife of Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. it's called <hi>the body of Chriſt.</hi> This Church is meant in the <hi>Creed,</hi> when we believe there is an <hi>holy Catholick Church,</hi> and ſo a <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> though ſome would have it a communion in holy things. To this Church belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all the godly that lived in the Old Teſtament. For that is a dangerous errour of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that make the Church in the Old Teſtament ſpecifically diſtinct from that in the New, as if they were not ſaved by the ſame Chriſt, and the ſame faith, as we are under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Now it's very neceſſary to diſtinguiſh this <hi>Catholick inviſible Church</hi> from a <hi>viſible particular one.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> confounding theſe, and making their <hi>Roman particular Church,</hi> a <hi>Catholick</hi> one, and applying ſuch Texts of Scripture, as are ſpoken of the Univerſal inviſible Church, to their particular, do thereby groſly miſtake in pleading for the infallibility and perpetuity of their Church. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Scripture doth uſe the word <hi>Church</hi> for a <hi>viſible company of perſons profeſſing faith in Chriſt,</hi> and then it hath ſeveral acceptions. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is uſed for the <hi>general Company of believers,</hi> Act. 8. 3. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid to <hi>perſecute the Church.</hi> Or elſe more particularly, and for a Church at ſuch a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48709:38"/>
place, as the <hi>Church at Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Church at Corinth.</hi> Again, the word <hi>Church</hi> is ſometimes uſed more ſtrictly, for <hi>the People onely,</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</hi> Thus the <hi>Epiſtles of John</hi> are directed, <hi>To the Angels of the ſeven Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</hi> Thus the Elders are exhorted, <hi>Act. 20. 28. To feed the Church of God, over which they were ſet.</hi> And in this ſenſe the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſpeak confidently, That the word <hi>Church</hi> is moſt commonly uſed, and that never, or very ſeldom, it comprehends the Officers alſo. But this is not ſo, for <hi>Mat. 18. Tell the Church,</hi> by the Church muſt needs be meant <hi>Officers</hi> at leaſt with the Church, for they are ſaid to <hi>bind and loſe,</hi> which power is given to <hi>Officers</hi> only. It's true, they, and ſo <hi>Grotius,</hi> by <hi>Church</hi> underſtand a multitude, or more, in oppoſition to thoſe two or three witneſſes, that were required before: But the Context may eaſily be improved to overthrow that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. God is there ſaid to <hi>ſet in his Church, ſome Paſtors, and Teachers,</hi> that is, as part, but the chief part of the Church. Even as the Starres are ſet in the firmament, but as parts of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, though the more noble and fulgent parts. Again, when the Apoſtle here writeth to the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> he muſt needs comprehend the <hi>Officers</hi> as well as the <hi>People,</hi> becauſe he writeth about ſuch duties, wherein the Officers were intereſted, as the <hi>cenſuring of the inceſtuous perſon;</hi> he ſpeaks alſo of <hi>Prophets,</hi> which were extraordinary Officers in that Church, and they are blamed for <hi>male-adminiſtration about the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper.</hi> So that although <hi>Grotius</hi> thinketh that abuſe was, becauſe they had no conſtituted Officers, yet it's plain they had ſome, becauſe they had the adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The word <hi>Church</hi> is applied ſometimes to an <hi>eſſential Church,</hi> as it is called, <hi>for a company of believers ſimply as ſuch believing in Chriſt,</hi> of which often in Scripture, ſometimes for an <hi>organized Church,</hi> that is, formed and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that godly order by a Miniſtry, Government and Diſcipline conjoyned together. So that they make a particular flock being bound to ſubmit to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, as their peculiar Paſtors, and Paſtors bound to watch over them, as their peculiar flock. Whether indeed this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was one <hi>Congregational Church,</hi> or one Church aggregated of ſeveral Congregations, is diſputed. But of this in its time. This Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was formed and ſtated in ſome order, though there were great abuſes in it. As for our common uſe of the word <hi>Church,</hi> taking it for a place, or the material building, that is an improper ſpeech, but allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth, both the place and perſons therein convened. And although one or two learned men from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. would have the word uſed there for a place; yet the arguments are not cogent; for the people are properly the Church, it's <hi>they that Chriſt hath redeemed, they are to be built up by Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> whereas the material Church is built by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Artificers, not needing an Apoſtle, but a Carpenter.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for Explication, only let this be added, that the Greek word relates to Gods calling, it ſignifieth a <hi>Society called by God.</hi> So that the Apoſtle directs his Epiſtle to that Society or company of perſons that did come our from the Heatheniſh Idolatries and abominations, that the other <hi>Corinthians</hi> lived in, and did profeſs their faith in Chriſt, with obedience to him. From whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Church is a company called of God by the preaching of the Word to the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What we are properly to underſtand by a Church in Scripture.</note> 
                  <hi>profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, and an obſervation of all that ſolemn worſhip and Ordinances which Chriſt hath appointed, with a life in external conformity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Church. When you read of a <hi>Church at Jeruſalem,</hi> a <hi>Church at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, the ſeven Churches of Aſia,</hi> you are to underſtand ſuch a company. And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48709:39"/>
this Doctrine about a Church is much to be inſiſted on. People are generally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ignorant and prophane. And although they would think it an high reproach to have the name of a Church denied them, or to be caſt out of the Church, as ſo many Heathens, yet they do not attend to the nature of a <hi>Church,</hi> nor to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of thoſe who are to be members thereof. It is true, there are vaſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Diſputes about a <hi>Church,</hi> and every ſect or party, is ready to <hi>monopolize</hi> and <hi>appropriate</hi> that name to them, That they are only the Church. But theſe great Diſputes about it, argue we ſhould be more carefull to diſtinguiſh, leſt we take <hi>Babylon</hi> for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> leſt we take that for <hi>Gods Temple,</hi> which is indeed a <hi>den of thieves.</hi> Doth not the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party glory in the <hi>name of a Church?</hi> Do they not make it neceſſary to ſalvation to come into communion with it? and yet it is the place, that Gods people are called to come out of, leſt they partake both of her ſins and puniſhments.</p>
               <p>But let us examine the chief particulars in the Doctrine, which is a popular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeription of a Church. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſay, <hi>It is a Society or Company.</hi> So that one man cannot be called a Church. It's abſurd in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that when they have lifted up the name of a Church like a <hi>Gorgons head,</hi> to turn all men into ſtones, that they muſt not mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a word againſt it; when you come to examine, what this Church is; at laſt it is but one man, and that is the <hi>Pope.</hi> What number goeth to make a Church is not defined. To a formed organized Church, there muſt be ſo many at leaſt, that Church duties, which are eſſential, may be performed; and a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Governours, and governed maintained; otherwiſe where <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> are, there is a Church, ſaid <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Again, In that it is a Company, we ſee, That it is not lawfull for a man to think of ſerving God alone by himſelf, when there is an opportunity of joyning to a Church. You read <hi>Act.</hi> 3. and 4. as any perſons were converted, preſently <hi>they joyned themſelves to the Church.</hi> It is true, there may be ſuch perſecutions, or other impediments, that Chriſtians have wandered up and down, and could not enjoy publick or private meetings; but this abſence from Church-communion was an heavy burden on their ſpirits. And as <hi>David,</hi> when baniſhed from the publick Ordinances, lamented it more than baniſhment from his own houſe, and land, and native countrey. Thus they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with him, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo pant our ſouls after thee, O God.</hi> You ſee then it's a duty to be of a Church. Hence becauſe a Church is a company, we are diligently to attend to what is our duty, as we are a Church, and this you had need hear of often. For you muſt know you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>two-fold conſideration;</hi> One <hi>Abſolute,</hi> as a private and ſingle perſon, and ſo you have ſeveral duties to attend unto. 2. <hi>Relative,</hi> as you are a member of a Church, or part of ſuch a Society; and ſo there are choice and ſpecial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Your ſolemn Church-duties, ſuch as hearing, praying, and all other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip, are to be preferred above all private. He can never be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that is not a good member of that Church he is of. As in Politicks it's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, he cannot be <hi>bonus vir,</hi> which is not <hi>bonus civis,</hi> not a <hi>good man,</hi> that is not a <hi>good Citizen.</hi> Now certainly, here is a wonderfull neglect and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral fault in all our Congregations; we attend not to our Church-duties, to our Church-communion, what God doth require of us, as a Society, as a ſpiritual Company; there would not be that neglecting of the Aſſemblies, thoſe wicked and ungodly meetings, to be drunk, to be carnally merry and jolly, which are directly contrary to Church-meetings. Nothing doth ſo reſemble Heaven, as the Church Aſſemblies ſpiritually performed; and to ſuch meetings God hath promiſed his more peculiar preſence and aſſiſtance. But of this more in its time.</p>
               <p>In the next place, there is added in the Doctrinal Deſcription, <hi>That it is a Company of perſons called of God by the preaching of the Word:</hi> Wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48709:39"/>
the <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> and the <hi>Inſtrumental.</hi> The <hi>Efficient</hi> is <hi>God, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God.</hi> And firſt, In that they are ſaid to be <hi>called by God.</hi> This implieth theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it's the meer goodneſs and grace of God that makes a people to be a Church.</hi> Therefore they are thus named <hi>Eccleſia.</hi> The <hi>Grecians</hi> called their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies ſo, becauſe of ſome humane Authority gathering them together; but the people of God are called a <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe God calls them. So that as there is a difference between a garden and a wilderneſs; the one is naturally ſo, but the other is planted by art and induſtry; nature doth not of it ſelf, eſpecially ſince mans fall, bring forth gardens and choice flowers, but there is great art and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture required thereunto. Thus it is with the Church, men are made the Church by Gods grace, but they are the world of themſelves. The <hi>world</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> are two oppoſites, <hi>God</hi> makes the one, and is preſent in a ſpecial manner there, but <hi>ſinne</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> make and rule in the other. When the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>It is he that hath made us, not we our ſelves, we are the ſheep of his paſture. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> underſtands it of their Church making; it was the goodneſs and power of God that made them ſo. Hence it is, that it is often compared to, and called the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> becauſe it's original is from Heaven, and their Laws and Ordinances are heavenly. Thus you ſee, to be made a Church is not by our humane will and power, as men make themſelves Cities and Corporations, but by a ſpecial grace of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>called by God,</hi> that doth neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>terminus</hi> from which we are called. It's a company of perſons called out from the world, wherein once they were. Hence the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>world,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> together; and the <hi>world</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>without God,</hi> then when he gathers a Church, <hi>He calls them out of the world;</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> was called out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which was ready to be deſtroyed with fire and brimſtone: or as a man is called out from an houſe that is ready to fall into its fulnes; and this it is that makes it to be ſuch an admirable priviledge and bleſſedneſs to be of the Church. For the world is ſure <hi>to periſh,</hi> is ſure <hi>to be damned; there is no abiding therein;</hi> as if an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had continued in an <hi>Aegyptians</hi> houſe, when the deſtroying Angel paſſed by, he was ſure to be killed. Thus there is no way but of damnation in the world, without this Ark of the Church, every one muſt neceſſarily periſh. But this is that which ſhould make all our hearts ake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at, to conſider, That though the Church be called out of the world, yet it's almoſt degenerated into the world again. Look over the face and converſation of all Churches, Are they not become the world? Is not a garden made a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? Is not the luſts, the prophaneneſs, the ignorance, the impieties that are in the world to be found in the Church like wiſe? And what hath been the ſad occaſion of ſo many to ſay, Our Congregations are no Churches, that a man cannot with a good conſcience ſtay amongſt you, or have communion with you? Is it not becauſe of the univerſalimpiety they ſee amongſt us? As if the Church of God, which is like the <hi>Ark</hi> in other things were in this alſo, that all kind of things unclean, as well as clean, ſwine as well as ſheep, vultures as well as doves, were to be taken into it. We ſee, as it hath been <hi>Gods</hi> work, to turn the world into Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: ſo it hath been the <hi>Devils</hi> work to turn the Churches into the world again. But wo be to the wicked man, that is ſo in the Church of God, God will be ſure to puniſh you! A nettle or weed in the garden is ſure to be plucked up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the wilderneſs it may grow, and never be medled with.</p>

               <p>VVE are deſcribing the nature of a <hi>particular viſible Church;</hi> and in that have diſcuſſed the <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> with the manner of his effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, expreſſed in thoſe words <hi>[Called of God]</hi> what is implied in that, hath been examined: only there remaineth a neceſſary diſtinction to be attended unto, of Gods call; that it is two-fold, either <hi>External only,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> and <hi>Internal</hi> alſo; or an <hi>Effectual,</hi> and <hi>Ineffectual Calling.</hi> For though this diſtinction be hated by ſome men, yet the Scripture is very clear, <hi>That there are many called, who yet are not choſen:</hi> and when he ſaith <hi>called,</hi> it is not meant only actively on Gods part, as ſome were called, but yet refuſed, and would <note place="margin">Gods call as the efficient cauſe of the Church, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther external only, or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal alſo.</note> not ſo much as outwardly profeſs obedience, but <hi>called</hi> is to be underſtood paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively on mans part, ſo that he giveth ſome outward conformity to Gods call. There is an external reception, and ſubmiſſion to it, but yet there is no true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſanctification: Inſomuch that ſome who are <hi>called the children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall be caſt forth;</hi> and they are ſaid not to be <hi>all Iſrael, who are of Iſrael.</hi> In the Old Teſtament we read of many who outwardly ſubmitted to the profeſſion of Gods commands, who yet were not found at heart; and therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the courſe of his Miniſtry did not direct his preaching more to any ſubject almoſt then this, <hi>viz.</hi> to have the internals of grace, as well as exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; ſo that we may ſay, <hi>There is a called and elected Church,</hi> and a <hi>called Church only not elected;</hi> and this is to take off all Churches from idolizing and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Ordinances and external adminiſtrations which are in a Church, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, and as moſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do. We are to go further, and to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be indeed and really Chriſts body, as well as ſeemingly. For if we do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Church called only, with the Church called and elected, and to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual priviledges that are promiſed; ſo our Divines uſe to ſay, <hi>That it is but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally a Church;</hi> they have no true acceptance with God. If there ſhould be a Society profeſſing faith in Chriſt, and have pure adminiſtrations, but not one in the Society having true real ſanctifying grace; this Society in reſpect of God and Chriſt hath no true communion with them. They have but the name, not the nature, and ſo are <hi>equivocally,</hi> not <hi>univocally</hi> a true Church. For why ſhould it be otherwiſe with a Society, then every member of it taken ſingly? Now it's certain in ſuch a ſuppoſed Society, where all are profeſſors, but not one member truly godly, there every individual perſon, notwithſtanding all Church enjoyments, yet hath no lively intereſt in Chriſt, he is but as a glaſs eye or wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en leg in the body, that hath no vivifical nouriſhment, or is animated by the ſoul; and therefore ſuch are ſaid to be <hi>De corpore Eccleſiae,</hi> but not <hi>de animâ,</hi> if then
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48709:40"/>
this be true of every member of that Church, it muſt be alſo true of the Church taken collectively: Only this is true, if we conſider ſuch a company relatively to God. But then, if we conſider them <hi>quoad nos,</hi> in reſpect of men, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge the hearts, nor know when true grace is in any mans ſoul, then ſuch a Church, or a Society may be called truly a Church. For it is the external profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and outward ſubmiſſion to Chriſts order, that doth make a Church viſible to us; and therefore in ſuch a Church, there are true Ordinances, true Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. And this is the rule we muſt go by in joyning our ſelves to a Church, and keeping external communion with it, if it be a called Church, though not elected, and be ſo farre orthodox and pure, that we may have communion with them without ſinne. This is a Church to us, howſoever God may look upon them, <hi>as having a name to live, but were dead,</hi> as God ſaid of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3. 1. which yet was a Church. This diſtinction is of a two-fold uſe, to prevent two miſtakes:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Of ſuch, who confound an <hi>external Church</hi> with an <hi>elected,</hi> making Gods call, and his election in an equal latitude, thinking that becauſe none but predeſtinated and truly ſanctified men are of the inviſible Church, therefore none but ſuch are alſo of the viſible. And then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Of thoſe, who if they be of a Church, eſpecially cleanſed from ſuperſtitions and prophaneneſs; if the Church be a Reformed Church, they reſt in thoſe external adminiſtrations, and never attend to the work of grace indeed. For if among <hi>Papiſts,</hi> though ſo greatly polluted, yet the Church is made an Idol to them; no wonder if the Reformed Churches are prone to put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Church-reformations, without attending to internal ſanctification. But the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Gal. 6. 15. That in Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion, or uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but a new creature,</hi> that is, no externals in the Church of God, though of his own inſtitution avail any thing without regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Therefore reſt not in this, that you are called of God, that ye are his Church; for many taken out of his Church, ſhall be damned, as well as out of the world; yea more in the Church, that is, the viſible Society profeſſing of Chriſt, will be damned then ſaved, as appeareth by that expreſſion twice repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Saviour, as being of ſo great concernment, being worthy to be heard again and again, <hi>Many are called, but few are ſaved,</hi> Mat. 22. 14. and 20. 16. And thus much of the <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> with the manner <hi>[Called of God.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, There is the <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> and that is <hi>by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</hi> For ſo we read upon Chriſts giving his Apoſtles commiſſion to <note place="margin">The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe of the Church is the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</note> teach and preach to all Nations, there were Churches gathered in every place. And this is to be underſtood of the ordinary way. For whether the Word even as read, may not in ſome extraordinary caſes be a means to bring ſome one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or more to the Church of God, is not here to be diſputed: for we ſpeak of the ſolemn, ordinary, inſtituted means of God, and ſo there is no other way but the preaching of the Word. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. you ſee there a conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenation and chaining of calling upon God, and believing together; of beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and hearing together, and of hearing and the Miniſtry together.</p>
               <p>But it's objected by the <hi>Socinians, That if the preaching of the Word be an inſtrument to gather a Church, then it cannot be a note of the Church. For that which is antecedent to a Church, and is before the Church is, cannot be a note of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this we may anſwer, That it is both an inſtrument to gather a Church, and then a note of it, when gathered; neither is there any abſurdity therein. It's true, that very numerical preaching, which at firſt made the Church, cannot be a mark or note of it, but the ſame ſpecifical preaching, or that which is like it, that doth truly declare where the true Church is. So that by this we may ſee, the dignity and uſefulneſs of the Miniſtry; for by that God is pleaſed to raiſe up
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48709:41"/>
all the Churches that are in the world. God who did immediatly create the world, and uſed no inſtruments, yet in planting of his Church doth, and therefore they are workers with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. Neither is the Miniſtry only neceſſary to conſtitute a Church, and then afterwards uſeleſs, as <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> ſaith. Where people have the Scriptures, there the Miniſtry is of no neceſſity. Yea the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> make it only a matter of order and conveniency. For Miniſters are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed to gather Churches at firſt, but when they are planted, continually to water them. Therefore <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. their uſefulneſs is ſhewed even to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Churches; <hi>For the further building them up, even till they come to a full ſtature in Christ.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtles thought it not enough to make Churches, to erect new ſpiritual Societies, that ſhould profeſs Chriſt; but Elders were to be ordained in every Church, that were to have conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence amongſt them, and to give them daily food, watching over their ſouls, and therefore their title of <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and the people being called a <hi>Flock,</hi> do evidently demonſtrate the neceſſity of a Miniſtry not only at firſt, as miracles were, but perpetually even to the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is in the Deſcription, the <hi>Formal Cauſe;</hi> to which alſo may be <note place="margin">The formal cauſe, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Church communion. Wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Church communion.</note> reduced the <hi>Final Cauſe.</hi> The <hi>Formal Cauſe</hi> is in the publick, and ſolemn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that <hi>Church-communion</hi> which God hath required. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention that formal and external Communion, wherein it conſiſts: And that is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the ſolemn aſſembling and meeting of themſelves together,</hi> Heb. 10. 25. The Apoſtle doth there reprove the neglect of this duty, which is the ſeminary and fountain of all holineſs; while the coals lie together they keep their heat, and inflame one another. Thus it's our communion in the Aſſemblies that is the means to keep up grace and holineſs. How much did <hi>David</hi> bewail his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from the Ordinances, as you heard? And is it not the higheſt cenſure, and moſt dreadfull puniſhment that can be, for a Chriſtian upon juſt grounds to be caſt out of the Church? Is not this to fall into the Kingdom of Satan? Is it not to be delivered up to him? Now then, if it be next to hell it ſelf, thus to be caſt out of <hi>Church-communion</hi> and the publick Ordinances, Why doeſt thou wilfully bring this upon thy ſelf? Thy own ſlothfull, and prophane care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heart makes thee neglect the publick Aſſemblies. This is a ſinne of an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nature than thou art aware of, for God is preſent in Church Aſſemblies, you have the benefit of the prayers then poured forth; the Ordinances are of enlightning and quickning efficacy. Now for thee voluntarily to deprive thy ſelf of this ſpiritual advantage, is a ſinne of an high degree. Indeed when want of health, or other juſt impediments keep us from the Aſſemblies, God can then make up the publick benefits in private. But I ſpeak of a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wilfull omiſſion of ſuch publick <hi>Communion.</hi> Oh little do ſuch men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they have but a day! Their life is but a day, and the ſeaſon of grace is but a day; and doeſt thou neglect that day, when it may be, thou ſhalt never have ſuch a day again, never have a Sabbath any more? That carnal plea alſo of getting as much good at home, and they can edifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well with reading books in private, unleſs in caſe of neceſſity (as I ſaid) is ungodly and unjuſtifiable excuſe; for this is to make Church-communion, and holy Aſſemblies to be of no neceſſity, and ſo wholly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this ſolemn meeting there are theſe publick duties, wherein the Church is to imploy her ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Publick prayer to God.</hi> This in the primitive times was done ſo ſervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and zealouſly, that they did even ſeem to beſiege Heaven, and to take it by force.

               <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>publick preaching of the Word;</hi> And this neceſſarily ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a formed and ſtated Church, wherein are Governours and governed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe who by Office preach, and thoſe who by duty hear. This publick Miniſtry in the Church of God, is not for convenience, or good order meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it is an inſtitution of Chriſt, and hath ſeveral effects attributed to it, as converſion of ſuch who are in their natural condition, the edifying of thoſe, who are converted; for inſtruction, that men be not led aſide with errours and ſtrange Doctrine; for rebuke and reproof of ſuch who walk diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore becauſe of the neceſſity of it, thoſe who have commiſſion to do it, have manifold directions about it, <hi>To preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon;</hi> and the reaſon ſeemeth ſtrange, <hi>Becauſe there are many, who will not endure ſound Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 2. Yea, there is a wo to them, if they be negligent herein, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. And in all this they are to be inſtant and induſtrious, it being a curſed thing to do <hi>the work of the Lordnegligently.</hi> The matter they preach, muſt be holy, ſavoury and nouriſhing, compared therefore to food: You are to come to a Sermon with an hungry ſtomack. Yea, as <hi>new born chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> ye are to ſwallow down <hi>the ſincere milk of the Word.</hi> And therefore to preach froth and meer fancifull things is as abſurd, as if a man ſhould invite another to a dinner, and provide him nothing but the pictures of ſome meat. It's compared to ſeed; the Husbandman will not ſow his ground with chaff: Yea, it's compared to a <hi>two-edged ſword, that is quick and piereing into the very ſecret thoughts of mens hearts.</hi> It is for want of ſuch ſoul-piercing and ſoul-ſaving preaching, that people are lulled, or ſleep in their ſinnes; that there is nothing but formality and cuſtomarineſs in moſt men. The word of God is to flaſh in your faces like ſo much lightning, and to make even the proudeſt and the moſt ſcornfull to tremble within them. <hi>They muſt ſpeak as the Oracles of God.</hi> What is that, but as men filled with the Spirit of God, breaking out like fire from them? And with ſuch proportionable affections are you to hear: This is to meet as the Church of God, no man ſleeping, no man drouſie, or wandering, and roving in his mind; but to ſay with the <hi>Centurion, We are all here, to hear what God will ſay to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Adminiſtration of Sacraments according to Gods order, and ſuch holy wayes as he hath appointed.</hi> The Sacraments are of infinite conſequence to the Church of God; and when people through their ignorance and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs make themſelves unfit ſubjects, they are enemies to their ſouls. For though God be preſent in the Word and prayer, yet his ſacramental preſence is in a more indeared and peculiar manner.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is that godly Diſcipline, and holy Order in Church-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> which is as the hedge to the field of corn. Take away this holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Church will become a gangrened body, either with hereſies or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs. Hence is that binding and loſing of ſinners: Hence is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>casting out wicked obſtinate perſons, of pirging out the old leaven,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48709:42"/>
becauſe a little leaven will quickly ſour all,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. Hence alſo are thoſe duties of <hi>admoniſhing,</hi> and <hi>noting ſuch as go aſtray,</hi> and the <hi>turning from thoſe that walk diſorderly,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. Theſe ſeveral acts of Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline commanded in the Scripture, are very evident. And although there are a generation of men, who would with ſcorn and pride cry it down, as lordly and Popiſh, and I know not what; yet at laſt it will be found, that that it was only their luſts and love to ſinne, their hatred of ſinne, their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of powerfull godlineſs, which provoketh them hereunto. What would they have ſaid, if they had lived in <hi>Tertullians, Cyprians, Chryſoſtomes</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s dayes, when there was ſuch zeal in Church Diſcipline againſt all prophaneneſs, that in ſome things they were immoderately ſevere? If then this be the external form of Church-communion, if in theſe things Church Aſſemblies are to be exerciſed, let us mourn for our general Apoſtaſie, that in ſome ſenſe our Church Aſſemblies have been like the world at firſt, a meer chaos and confuſion: Not that ever any Church will be ſo reformed, as that it will not need further Reformation: But only let us endeavour to attain what degree of purity may be had.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>YOu have heard what is to be vnderſtood by this expreſſion of a <hi>Church.</hi> The true Doctrine about this being ſo neceſſary, I ſhall further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelf, not entring into the whole Common-place of a Church: for that would be too prolix, and ere this Epiſtle be ended, we may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily meet with more Texts, that may afford further knowledge in this point. Only I ſhall after the popular definition of a Church, give you the Notes, or Marks, whereby we may come to know, what is, or where is the true Church. For this hath been a great controverſie between Papiſts, and us.</p>
               <p>There are indeed ſome of late, as the <hi>Remonſtrants Epiſcopius,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Object.</note> who ſay, <hi>This dispute and enquiry about the marks of a Church, is wholly uſeleſſe and needleſſe. For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>either we have to do with an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, or a Believer; if with an Infidel, it is abſurd to tell him of the Notes of a Church, who doth not believe there is any ſuch thing as a Church at all. And for a Believer, he is in the Church already, and ſo they are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to him.</hi> But this is meerly frivolous. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we have to do with an unbeliever, we muſt not in the firſt place <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why needfull to know the Marks of a true Church.</note> deal with him about a Church, to prove that we are the true Church, but that there is a God, who is to be worſhipped, as natural light will convince of this. Then, that this God hath made known how he will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Next, that the Scriptures do contain this revealed will of God. And when this foundation is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid, then out of Gods Word we are to inform
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48709:42"/>
him of a Church. So that in order, there is, firſt, The Word of God to be diſcovered: 2. What is the true ſenſe and meaning of it. Laſtly, That what ſociety hath this, there is a true Church. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, Even Heathens by hearing of the Word preached, have by the Grace of God been converted, and ſo the Word preached, which was at firſt inſtrumental to convert them, doth afterwards by way of a ſign or mark, confirm them therein. The Apoſtle tells us of an unbeliever, coming into Church-meetings, who is ſo wrought upon, that he crieth out, <hi>Verily God is here,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 25.</p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Believer</hi> the notes of a Church are neceſſary, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirming and eſtabliſhing of him. For ſeeing that every Party or Sect ſaith, <hi>They are the true Church, and with them onely is Communion to be had, condemning other meetings, as falſe, as the Synagogue of Satan, and as neceſſarily damning all thoſe that continue in that Communion differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from them:</hi> It is thereby of great uſe, that we ſhould have ſuch Notes or Marks, to conclude that where ſuch are, certainly there is a Church; for we are not to be <hi>Scepticks</hi> or <hi>Seekers.</hi> When the Scripture commands us, <hi>To tell the Church,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>To conjoyn our ſelves to the Church of God,</hi> it plainly intimateth, that ſuch a Society may be known. Even as there was a Star to guide the Wiſemen unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, There are three things neceſſary to make a Note, or a <note place="margin">What things neceſſary to make a Note or Mark.</note> Mark of a Church.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It muſt be <hi>more known than the thing it ſelf.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. It muſt be <hi>proper and peculiar to that thing alone, of which it is a Note.</hi> For if it be common to others, it cannot be a Note. Senſe is not a Note of a man, becauſe it's common to a beaſt. And</item>
               </list>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>It muſt be inſeparable.</hi> For if it doth not alwayes agree to it, then we cannot tell how to diſcern that we look for.</p>
               <p>Now for ſuch Notes of the Church, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſay, there are theſe three <note place="margin">What are the Notes of a true Church.</note> only.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>pure preaching of the Word,</hi> with the publick receiving and profeſſing of it.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>right and orderly adminiſtration of the Sacraments.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>due uſe of holy Order and Diſcipline.</hi> Where theſe things are, there we may conclude, that certainly Gods true Church is, and with ſuch a Society we may lawfully joyn.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thirdly, Only when we give theſe three Notes, we do not make all of the ſame equal neceſſity. <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>holy Order</hi> is for the well-being of a Church. This Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a Church, though that was neglected. It is true, this is greatly to be preſſed for, and the introducing of Chriſts order into a Church, is like the bringing of the Ark into <hi>Obed-Edoms</hi> family. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, manifeſt impiety being ſuffered, God will be ſo highly provoked, as to give a Bill of Divorce to it, and take away his Goſpel from ſuch an unworthy, people; yet this is not made eſſential to the being of a Church. So alſo the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Sacraments.</hi> There was a time, when the Church had none, <hi>viz.</hi> before Circumciſion was appointed; but ſince Chriſts appointment of them, there they ought to be uſed, where the way and manner he hath appointed can be attained. For the diſpenſers of thoſe holy Myſteries muſt take heed, <hi>That they give not pearl to ſwine,</hi> nor encourage prophane men in their impieties, by giving them the teſtimonies of Gods love, whom yet he abhorreth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is infallibly neceſſary, and alwayes accompanying a true Church, is <hi>the preaching of the Word</hi> in a right manner, <hi>with the publick receiving and profeſſion of this.</hi> I adde, <hi>the publick profeſſion;</hi> becauſe the Word may be purely taught to a people, who yet are not the Church, becauſe they do
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48709:43"/>
refuſe and reject the Goſpel tendred to them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heathens; ſo that there muſt be a manifeſt and publick profeſſion of it. And beſides the true preaching of the Word is only a ſign of a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, not of a true Church, unleſs they give their conſent thereunto. So that when our Divines ſay, <hi>The pure preaching of the Word is a Note of the Church;</hi> They include and ſuppoſe the <hi>publick receiving of it by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> yea ſome do clearly expreſſe it. By this pure and true preaching of the Word, we may diſcern the true Church from <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> as alſo from Heretical and Idololatrical Societies, yet pretending to a Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When theſe Notes, eſpecially the former, are ſaid to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and inſeparable to the Church of God:</hi> You muſt alwayes remember here is a latitude in the application of theſe Notes. For ſome Churches may have the Word more ſoundly preached, and the Sacraments more diſpenſed than another, and yet for all that not to be denied to be Churches. This Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was foully out of order: And ſo moſt of thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in <hi>Aſia</hi> were ſharply reproved, yet they did not ceaſe to be a Church. Yea the <hi>Church of Iſrael</hi> had many corruptions both in worſhip and life, yet it was a long while ere God did caſt her off. So that we muſt not for ſome defilements either in the Doctrine, Worſhip or Manners of a Church, preſently deny her to be a Church, and ſeparate from her, for this is againſt Scripture information. Yea, there is no Church ſo perfect, but needeth ſome Reformation. They may build hay and ſtubble, though they keep the foundation. So that he muſt go out of the world, that would live in a Church, where nothing is amiſs. Even that Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> the Apoſtle mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 8. that was as her Name, ſignifying ſweet ſmelling, and fragrant like a Garden, or bed of Spices, yet ſhe was troubled with ſome, who ſaid, <hi>They were Jews, but were not, but were of the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> But of this more, when we come to the next Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Theſe then being the viſible Marks of a viſible Church, we muſt not confound them with the properties of the Church inviſible. The Church of God hath as it were a two-fold <hi>Form;</hi> one <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>Eſſential,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in their Union with Chriſt, and communion with his benefits. Now none but thoſe that are truly godly are of the Church in this inviſible manner, he muſt be regenerated and graffed into Chriſt, that can have any ſaving benefit by Chriſt. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Church of God hath an <hi>External</hi> and <hi>outward Form,</hi> which conſiſts in the external profeſſion of faith, and obſervance of Chriſts Ordinances. Now a man may be of the Church in reſpect of this outward ſtanding, though he be not truly godly. Therefore D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ames</hi> ſaid well, That it was a falſe thing, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objected to us, about the conſtitution of a Church; as if we required internal graces, to the making of a man a member of the Church, in reſpect of the viſible ſtate of it. We read in the New Teſtament, that upon the outward profeſſion of their faith, they were baptized, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church, though it's plain all of them had not true internal grace. So then, when the Queſtion is put, <hi>Whether may a man that is not truly godly, be of the Church or no?</hi> You muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form</hi> of the Church, which is union with Chriſt the Head, and ſo he is not, no more than a wooden leg is a member of the body, that is not ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the ſoul, and the <hi>External viſible ſtate</hi> of it, and ſo he is of the Church, till by his obſtinacy in wickedneſs, he be caſt out as unworthy. We muſt not therefore give thoſe Notes of the Church as viſible, which belong to it only as inviſible, <hi>viz. Election, Vocation,</hi> and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Papiſt</hi> to avoid this extream, he giveth ſuch Marks of a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48709:43"/>
Church, as ſavour rather of worldly ambition and pride. Yea the true Church of God many times is known by the contrary Marks; they give amplitude and univerſality, as alſo temporal felicity. Now this is rather a Deſcription of ſome worldly Monarchy than Gods Church. For, as for the Churches am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude, though abſolutely in it ſelf, it may be ſometimes numerous, yet at other times it hath been brought into a narrow compaſſe. <hi>Elijah</hi> thought none was left, and God ſpeaks of but <hi>ſeven thouſand that did not how the knee to Baal,</hi> which was a very inconſiderable number to the Idolaters. Therefore reſpectively to the wicked of the world, even when they are moſt ample, they are but a little flock. And as for any glorious felicity, though the Church of God hath ſometimes had her reſpite and halcyon dayes, yet for the moſt part a crown of thorns hath been on her head; and therefore ſhe is juſtly called, the <hi>Militant Church,</hi> while in this world, becauſe of her ſpiritual conflict with all ſorts of enemies. So that the Church of Chriſt may ſometimes ſay, as Chriſt once did, <hi>The Foxes have their holes, and the Birds of the air their neſts, but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> Thus the Foxes of the world, the crafty ſubtil men have great abundance many times, when the Church hath hid her ſelf in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And Fowls of the air, men of proud and lofty minds, have their neſts; when the Church like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, hath not where to ſet her foot.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, I ſhall not enlarge my ſelf to prove theſe only to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Notes of the Church, only conſider that place, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41, 42. where you have all of them conjoyned together: 1. <hi>They received the Word gladly.</hi> There is a ſolemn profeſſion of it. 2. <hi>There is the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;</hi> They were baptized, and <hi>continued in breaking of bread, with prayers.</hi> There is the ſolemn calling upon God. And as an epitomizing of all this it's ſaid, <hi>Then were added unto the Church about three thouſand ſouls.</hi> Thus 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. the Church is called, <hi>The pillar and foundation of the truth,</hi> that is, by the Miniſteries preſervation of it, and the peoples ſubmitting unto it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If to this it be objected, as <hi>Socinians</hi> do, who hold this way of Notes to find out a Church, to be uſeleſs and vain, That true Doctrine cannot be a ſign of the Church, becauſe it's the <hi>Form and Eſſence</hi> of it. Now <note place="margin">How the form of a thing may be a Note or Mark of it.</note> that which notifieth the eſſence of a thing, muſt be diſtinct from it. To this it is anſwered, That the form, as it giveth being to a thing, ſo it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to diſtinguiſh from others, <hi>Forma dat eſſe, &amp; diſtingui.</hi> Although we do not ſay, True Doctrine is the Note of a Church, but the external preaching, and receiving of it, that is a Note, incurring into our ſenſes: Even as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> though it give a man his rational being, yet ſpeaking is the proper and true ſign, that manifeſts this: So let true Doctrine, or a true faith be the ſoul and life of a Church, yet the external profeſſion is the outward Note and Sign of it. And if further it be ſaid, <hi>That every Sect doth claim to it ſelf the pure preaching of the Word, and the right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Ordinances; Therefore theſe cannot be a ſign.</hi> It's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, The conſequence is denied, for true preaching and confeſſion is a ſign, although Hereticks pretend thereunto. As true Miracles were a ſure Argument to prove the truth, although others have done, and Antichriſt will pretend to true Miracles. And indeed, though all Sects, as the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> eſpecially, pretend much to the Scripture, yet it is not the words on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the ſenſe of it, that is by the Context and Scope to be diſcovered, that is the word of God. Therefore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> of old ſaid elegantly, <hi>That Hereticks making the Scripture to speak what ſenſe they pleaſed, did as if a man ſhould take the Statue, or Image of a King, and ſo transpoſe the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48709:44"/>
parts of it, as to make it the image of a Dog, or ſome other vile thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things concluded on, let us draw ſome Uſes by way of Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that the holy Ghoſt is pleaſed to appropriate this Word in the New Teſtament to his people, which among the Heathens ſignifieth the meaner ſort of people; for that they called <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> and it was oppoſite to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Senate, which conſiſted of more noble men. Hence we may ſee, who they are that are moſt commonly called to be of his Church, even the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort, <hi>Not many rich, not many noble hath God called,</hi> 1 Corinth. 1. We ſhould not deſpiſe the Church of God, if it be not ſo externally pompous and glorious as Kingdoms and States. For Chriſt is more peculiarly preſent with his Church, and ſhed his bloud for that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That if we ſpeak properly, the Church is not a material place, not this building of ſtones and wood, but the people of God meeting there. Indeed it may tropically be well enough, called a <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Synagogue</hi> is applied to the place, <hi>He built us a Synagogue,</hi> whereas properly it ſignifieth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meeting together, as you heard. Thus <hi>Concio</hi> amongſt the Latines, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth both the <hi>place, and the company met together. Bellarmine</hi> would have the word to ſignifie a <hi>place,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. as alſo where it is ſaid, <hi>Let the woman keep ſilence in the Churches.</hi> And thoſe learned men <hi>Fuller</hi> and <hi>Mede</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it ſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. But there is no neceſſity of ſuch Interpretation. But though the Scripture doth not call it ſo, we may by a Trope give it that name, and uſe muſt authorize in theſe things. Though <hi>Ifidore Peluſiota</hi> in one of his Epiſtles, ſharply reproving a Biſhop, that adorned the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial place with Images and Ornaments, but neglected the Church of God, the true profeſſours he perſecuted, doth call the people <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the place <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Is it a Church, a company called by God? Then this ſheweth of what conſequence Unity and Concord is amongſt all the Members thereof. How can a body be kept together without ligaments and nerves? How can the building ſtand, if the wood and ſtraw be not aptly faſtned and cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together? How can the Church ſubſiſt, if there be not Love, Union and Concord? It's obſervable, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 2. that the Apoſtle thought it not too low a thing, even in canonical Scripture, to intreat two women that were at difference to be of the ſame mind, <hi>I beſeech Euodias, I beſeech Syntyche, that they be of one mind.</hi> Two godly women differing, the Apoſtle doth paſſionately intreat reconciliation and agreement, how much more then would he have intreated the Paſtors and Officers in the Church, to take heed of diſcord?</p>

                     </gap> probable, that this Church of Corinth was a combined or aſſociated Church, partly becauſe</hi> Act. 18. <hi>we may read of much people that God had in that place; and therefore</hi> Paul <hi>ſtaid above a year there, which argued a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of converts. The plenty alſo of their Teachers and Officers, with the diverſitie of tongues. And laſtly, in that</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 19. Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla <hi>are mentioned, with the Church in their houſe.</hi> It is true, what is meant by the Church in an houſe is controverted; we find the expreſſion four times in Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16 15. where <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> are ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>with the Church in their houſe.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19. theſe perſons are mentioned again <hi>with the Church in their houſe.</hi> Col. 4. 15. There one <hi>Nymphas is ſaluted with the Church in his houſe.</hi> Phil. 2. There likewiſe <hi>Philemon</hi> is mentioned, <hi>with the Church in his houſe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> doth from hence inferre, That even in the Apoſtles dayes, and ſo in the primitive times, that the Chriſtians had publick places, fixed and ſetled, being ſet apart for the publick Aſſemblies to worſhip God in, anſwering thoſe places of <hi>Arnobius</hi> and others, who told the Heathens they had no <hi>Templa,</hi> nor <hi>Aras;</hi> he ſaith, theſe mentioned in the Texts named, did ſet apart, ſome piece of their houſe for that end. But it ſhould ſeem by other paſſages, that in the Apoſtles dayes there were no fixed places for to meet in. Therefore ſometimes they meet in one houſe, and ſometimes in another; yea, <hi>They went from houſe to houſe.</hi> Others they think, by the <hi>Church in their houſe,</hi> is meant many believers. For they ſay, Whereas when other families are ſaluted, only ſome are named; ſometimes the Maſter of the houſe is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as, <hi>Salute the houſhold of Narciſſus,</hi> becauſe he was thought to be an infidel. Yea, <hi>Calvin</hi> thinketh, it is that infamous and wicked <hi>Nar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſſus,</hi> ſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48709:45"/>
notorious wicked, and great with <hi>Nero,</hi> of whom Hiſtorians ſpeak. Now when the Apoſtle ſalutes the men, and the <hi>Church in their houſe,</hi> it was, becauſe there were no unbelievers, but all were of the Church. Howſoever it be, it's plain there were many believers in that family more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and therefore called a Church, which ſhould argue, That the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a combined Church. That paſſage alſo makes it likely, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 34. Let your women be ſilent in the Churches: Your women]</hi> therefore he ſpeaks of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> there, who are ſaid to have <hi>Churches;</hi> and yet here it is called a <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will ſtill appear the more likely, if we conſider, that here were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as <hi>Gentiles</hi> in this <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> as <hi>Estius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth in the Preface to the firſt Epiſtle. Therefore when the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of ſome, who ſaid they were of <hi>Cephas,</hi> that relateth to the believing <hi>Jews;</hi> yet becauſe they were few comparatively to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> therefore the Apoſtle writeth to them, as if all were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as <hi>Chap. 12. 2. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away to dumb Idols,</hi> &amp;c. Hence the ſame Author ſaith, That it was one Church collected of all the believers in that place, <hi>Licet eſſe potuerint in eadem civitate diſtinctae, ut it a dicam parochiae.</hi> As for the notion of a learned man, That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> believers, and <hi>Gentile</hi> believers did make two diſtinct Churches, and had two diſtinct Biſhops, which he thinketh would ſalve ſome ſeeming contradictions in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, that being of an heterogeneous nature to my purpoſe, I paſſe it by.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is called a <hi>Church,</hi> which yet by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny probable Arguments ſeemeth to be more than one. Neither may we think, that Chriſt hath inveſted one ſingle Congregation (ordinarily) with all Church power. For that preſident and example of a Councel or Synod, mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 15. doth inform, That there are to be <hi>Synods,</hi> not only by way of advice, but by power, and that over <hi>particular Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We proceed to the next thing conſiderable in this deſcription of the Church, and that is the <hi>efficient Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Church of God.</hi> This diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church from all civil and meer political Aſſemblies. For, though the <hi>Earth be the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> yet the Church is the Lords in a more peculiar and appropriated manner. Sometimes the Church is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med abſolutely without any addition, as when <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid <hi>to perſecute the Church.</hi> Sometimes it's reſtrained to the <hi>place.</hi> Thus the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> but moſt commonly, it is the Church of God, or the Church of Chriſt. Sometimes both are put together, as 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 1. To the Church of the Theſſalonians which is in God the Father, and in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> So alſo 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 1. And certainly, if ſo be the Apoſtle conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering us meerly as creatures, maketh uſe of, and ſanctifieth that of the Poet, <hi>For we are his off-spring,</hi> how much more is it true of us, as members of a Church. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Church is Gods people in a more peculiar and ſpecial manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though he be the God of the world, yet in a more ſpecial manner he is <note place="margin">A Church is Gods people in a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner than others.</note> a God of his Church. The conſideration of this truth, may tend much to our ſpiritual edification. For if we are of God, how much ſhould it humble us to ſee any thing amongſt us, that is of ſin or the Devil? Is ignorance or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs of God? ſo, are humane ſuperſtitions of God?</p>
               <p>But to open this, let us conſider what is implied in this, when a Church is ſaid to be the <hi>Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, this ſheweth, That a Church is a <hi>ſupernatural Society,</hi> it's
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48709:45"/>
ſpiritual company of men. So that a Church is not like a civil Corporation, or like Kingdoms and Commonwealths, which are by meer humane Inſtitution and agreement, though Magiſtracy it ſelf it be of God, but are ſupernatural; and therefore it's called the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem which is from above;</hi> ſo the Church is called <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. even while it is here on Earth, before it is <hi>triumphant</hi> in Heaven. Now the Church is a <hi>ſupernatural Society</hi> many wayes, in which reſpect it may be called the Church of God in a more eminent manner. For in reſpect of its <hi>Efficient,</hi> ſo God alone is the author of it, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> becauſe God by his Word calls them from their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idolatries and practiſes, making of them a Church. Thus the people of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when they were ſecurely indulging themſelves in all manner of impieties, having no thoughts or deſires to be a Church, God by <hi>Paul</hi> calls them to be one. Even as God by his breath, cauſed the dry bones to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together, and to live; or as at the day of Judgment, God by the voice of an <hi>Arch-angel,</hi> will raiſe the dead in the grave who have no life or ſenſe in them. Thus it's the Lord that made Churches every where in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel. It was the gracious work of God that found us out in <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>made a Church to himſelf,</hi> ſo that we are <hi>loca inacceſſa</hi> to the grace of God and his Spirit, though to humane power. It is true indeed, God is the God of the world, he created Heaven and Earth with all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet though God did thus immediately create the world at firſt, we do not ſay the creatures therein are Gods grace, or that they have a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being. For it's not enough to make a thing grace or ſupernatural, that God doth immediately create it, but that his power be in a peculiar and extraordinary manner, and that for ſupernatural effects and ends. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how greatly ſhould we be affected with the grace and power of God in creating to himſelf a Church out of the world? He might have no more made a Church here, or there in the Earth, then he did in Hell; and he that at firſt planted a curious Garden, and put man therein, is much more wonderfull in making of a Church to himſelf; yet how bruitiſh and earthly are we? We can bleſs God for the world, and the comforts thereof, that the Earth brings forth food for us, that we have the Air to breath in, the glorious Sunne to be a daily light to us, yet we are not thus affected with Church-mercies and Church-ordinances. <hi>David</hi> indeed upon the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, cried out, <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art thus mindfull of him, &amp;c?</hi> But we may much rather from theſe ſupernatural reſpects.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It's ſupernatural, in reſpect of the <hi>purchaſe given for them,</hi> the price paid to make them the Lords. For you muſt know, upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall all mankind was <hi>excommunicated, unchurched,</hi> as it were; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt out from Paradiſe, and Gods gracious preſence: and hence it is, that we are ſaid <hi>naturally to be without God;</hi> yea the Devil is ſaid to be <hi>the god of the world.</hi> Thus untill God makes us a Church, we are under the power of Satan wholly; and therefore to be caſt out of the Church, is to be delivered to Satan. Thus then being fallen off from the Lord, and now become the Devils, in whom he reigneth, we could not be purchaſed from this thraldom, but by the death of Chriſt; and therefore we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> as well as of <hi>God,</hi> becauſe though conquered by Gods Spirit, yet we are bought by his bloud; and this the Apoſtle urgeth, <hi>That therefore we are none of our own,</hi> but are to live to him. We are to be <hi>his peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2. 15. Thus it coſt more to be Gods Church, then to be the world at firſt; for he <hi>ſpake,</hi> and it was <hi>made,</hi> but here, Chriſt died, and ſo it was purchaſed. What a powerfull ingagement is this, for all of a Church to walk holily? What did Chriſt die, that you ſhould wallow in the filth of your ſins? What <hi>will you deny
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48709:46"/>
the Lord that bought you?</hi> If thou wilt be ignorant, and prophane, Why doeſt thou not go out from the Church of God? Why doeſt thou not turn <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> again? For certainly the Churches of Chriſt have no ſuch prophane cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It's ſupernatural, and of God, in reſpect of <hi>the Order, Laws, Rule and Government it is to walk by.</hi> The Doctrine believed is revealed by God. The Worſhip practiſed is to be appointed by God. The Government and Order is to be commanded by God. And thus, Beloved, we might at large ſhew you, That all things that are eſſential in the Church, are to be of God. No Doctrine, no Worſhip, no Adminiſtration of Sacraments, but what is of God. We might ſhew you, what God hath appointed in the <hi>Credendis,</hi> and <hi>Agendis Eccleſiae.</hi> Oh that this were well underſtood by us! What makes men ſo wilfull for their luſts, for their ſuperſtitious cuſtoms, but becauſe they conſider not the <hi>Church is a ſpiritual houſe,</hi> and the Laws and Orders thereof are appointed by Chriſt himſelf? If the Church be of God, all things therein muſt be of God likewiſe. Hence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Every plant that is not of my Fathers planting, ſhall be rooted out,</hi> Mat. 15. 13. What makes men rage and fret, if things in the Church be not according to their own humours and luſts? Is it not becauſe they do not attend to this, <hi>That it is Gods Church?</hi> It's not the Popes Church, nor the Magiſtrates Church, but <hi>Gods Church.</hi> Surely this truth would make us in all things ask, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did in another caſe, <hi>Whoſe image and ſuperſcription hath it? Give unto God the things that are Gods.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, It's ſupernatural, and of God, even in reſpect of the <hi>manner of doing all things in the Church.</hi> Every ſolemn duty is to be done as from God, and through him, even in an holy and divine manner. The Miniſter muſt preach, as inabled of God: The hearer muſt hear, as ſtrengthened thereunto of God. The Apoſtle praiſeth the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> That <hi>they received the Word, not as the word of man, but of God.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 17. As of God in the ſight of God,</hi> ſo ought all our Church-aſſemblies to be performed. What <hi>Jeremiah</hi> then hath his head full enough of water to make lamentation for the formality, cuſtomarineſs, and meer external ſervice that is done to God in our Aſſemblies? Men are become like <hi>Idols, having eyes they ſee not, ears they hear not, hearts they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not,</hi> whereas our praying, our hearing, our approachings in theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies ſhould be as of God; not Nature, or Cuſtom, or the Laws of men, but the Spirit of God mightily working in us, ſhould put us upon theſe things: Whereas now we ſee people in Church-aſſemblies, finding no more of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious power and preſence of God, then if they were in their markets, or other civil meetings. As the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Do ye ſeek an experiment of Chriſt in me?</hi> So ought it to be here, we are to demonſtrate in our Church-aſſemblies, experimental works of Chriſt upon us. As the duty is of God, the Ordinance is of God, ſo ſhould the frame, and diſpoſition of our hearts be of God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Church is of God in reſpect of his <hi>protection and gracious preſence.</hi> God promiſeth his preſence, and <hi>delights to be in the Aſſembly of his Saints,</hi> Matth. 18. 20. <hi>When two or three are gathered together in my Name, I will be in the midſt of them.</hi> It's the gracious preſence of God that bleſſeth Ordinances. Hence Chriſt is deſcribed, <hi>Revel. 1. 13. VValking in the midſt of the golden Candleſticks,</hi> that is, the Churches, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances therein. We are apt to complain, if Gods bleſſing goeth not along with us in outward undertakings: We can ſay, as <hi>Moſes</hi> to God, <hi>If thy preſence go not along with us, we will not go up.</hi> When it may relate to our outward advantage; but we do not take notice of Gods preſence in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48709:46"/>
the Aſſemblies, why God is not amongſt us to hear our prayers, why God is not preſent with the Word to make it an enlightning, a converting Word. It ſhould affect your hearts more than it doth, if in every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Spirit of God hath not fallen upon thy heart like fire; if it hath not melted, quickned, enlivened thy ſoul. Oh ſay, why did God withdraw himſelf, if he viſited the hearts of others, yet not mine? I was dead, luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and found no efficacy come from Chriſt. What ſins am I guilty of? What have I done that makes God thus abſent himſelf from the publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances at leaſt to me?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Church is of God, in reſpect of all the <hi>ſupernatural Effects</hi> and benefits, which alone are communicated there. In the Church of God alone is <hi>Juſtification, Sanctification, Aſſurance of his favour; In the pool of Betheſda</hi> onely did the Angel come in. In the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> only could <hi>Naaman</hi> be healed. In the Ark only could there be external ſafety from the waters: And thus in the Church only there are thoſe ſoul-mercies to be obtained.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Church is of God <hi>finaliter, Becauſe the enjoyment of God is the proper end of all Churches.</hi> It's true, all civil ſocieties are to make the glory of God their ultimate end; but yet the immediate end, is to acquire a temporal and political bleſſedneſs; but the end of Gods Church is more tranſcendent and ſpiritual, for therefore are preaching, hearing; therefore are Sabbaths, and our ſolemn Aſſemblies, that we might have more enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that our doubts may be anſwered, our corruptions mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our graces made more fervent and zealous. This made <hi>David</hi> ſo eſteem the Tabernacle of the Lord, and <hi>deſiring rather to be a door-keeper there,</hi> then to have any earthly greatneſs. What was it the material Tabernacles that <hi>David</hi> ſo longed for? No, it was the enjoyment of God in thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. But as little children admire the fine out-ſide of ſome excellent Book, when they underſtand not the excellent matter contained therein; ſo ſaith <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> many regard the out-ſides, and externals of religious duties, not knowing at all, what the ſpiritual effects thereof mean. Oh then let ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and wicked men tremble! If the Church be of God, how comeſt thou to be of the Devil, and to do his works?</p>

               <p>THe next thing to be treated of, is the Deſcription of this Church by the place where it is, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Corinth.</hi> And that we may underſtand the great grace and power of God in gathering a Church to himſelf out of this City; it's good to obſerve, what the Learned ſpeak of it. It was called ſo (they ſay) from <hi>Corinthus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> or of <hi>Pelops;</hi> but when they had in a diſhonourable manner abuſed ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours; they were deſtroyed by a <hi>Roman</hi> named <hi>Lucius Mummius,</hi> who from his victory over them was called <hi>Corinthiacus;</hi> but <hi>Auguſtus</hi> taking delight in the place reſtored it, and ſent a Colony thither to inhabit it. And it's plain by <hi>Acts</hi> 18. that they were then under a <hi>Roman</hi> called <hi>Gallio</hi> their <hi>Proconſul.</hi> It was the chief <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Achaia;</hi> and becauſe of the two Havens there, famous for Traffick, and thereby abounding in all wealth and riches. Theſe things are obſerved in it:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was notable for <hi>learning and knowledge. Periander</hi> one of the ſeven wiſe men, is ſaid to be of it; and therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth it, <hi>Totius Graeciae lumen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It was famous for <hi>wealth and riches,</hi> eſpecially their Braſs called <hi>Corinthiacum</hi> was eſteemed better than gold or ſilver, of which <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſometimes. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> did ſo delight in diſhes made of it, that he was called <hi>Corinthiarius.</hi> Their buildings alſo were very curious and glorious; inſomuch that <hi>Tirinus</hi> quoteth out of <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> that it was an ambition to build houſes <hi>formâ Corinthiacâ.</hi> But</p>

                  <hi>Tanti poenitentiam non einam;</hi> and becauſe their abominable unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was at ſo dear a rate; therefore (ſay ſome) came that Proverb, <hi>Non cuivis datur adire Corinthum;</hi> though <hi>Suidas</hi> and others, underſtand it of the difficulty of reaching into the Haven; and it ſhould ſeem that after many were turned Chriſtians, yet they were very prone to this bodily filthineſs; and therefore in no Epiſtles doth the Apoſtle ſo induſtrlouſly ſet himſelf againſt fornication as in this; and here was that abominable uncleanneſs committed even amongſt them, while a Church, <hi>That was not ſo much as named amongſt the Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee they were a proud, rich, high and laſcivious peple, and yet for all that, <hi>Act. 18.

               </p>
               <p>I have ſpoken to this truth in <hi>Paul</hi>'s caſe, and therefore ſhall be brief. Only the reaſon why God may build his houſe of ſuch crooked timber, and make his Temple of ſuch rough ſtones, may be to ſhew the freeneſs of his grace, and the efficacy of it. Both which are oppoſed by <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but gladly acknowledged by the godly man, who hath had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it. For the <hi>freeneſſe of Gods grace,</hi> that is ſeen two wayes, <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> and <hi>Comparatively. Abſolutely;</hi> For when God ſhall call ſuch to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who are ſo utter unworthy, that deſerve all the vengeance and wrath God can inflict upon them, this muſt diſcover grace to be exceeding <hi>free,</hi> and gracious. In ſtead therefore of the curſes of the Law, thou meeteſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with the promiſes of the Goſpel. In ſtead of hell and damnation, God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth Heaven and ſalvation. What can be freer then Gods love, and his gift herein? Thou art ſo farre from being in a ſtate of congruity or fitneſs that thou art in direct oppoſition and contrariety.</p>
               <p>Again, The grace of God is manifeſted to be <hi>free comparatively.</hi> For who can give a reaſon, why God calleth theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and not <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians?</hi> Were the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the only deſerving men in the world? Yea, there were more civil and moral people than they; yet to theſe, and not to many others is the grace of God communicated. Is not that admirable which our Saviour ſpeaks of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida. That if ſuch things had been done in Tyre and Zidon</hi> (Mat. 11. 21.) <hi>they would have repented long ago in ſackeloth and aſhes?</hi> You ſee then that the grace of God is not ſo much as offered to ſome, who yet externally at leaſt would have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated more humiliation and reformation, when yet it is plentifully beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thoſe, who are contemners and deſpiſers of it. The freeneſs then of Gods grace to ſome, and not to others is admirable, and ſheweth that there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Univerſal Grace. Common Grace is no Grace,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid well; neither is God an <hi>accepter of perſons</hi> in this thing, for that is committed only in things of <hi>juſtice;</hi> but in matters of <hi>liberality,</hi> there
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48709:48"/>
the free, liberal man may give as he pleaſe, to one, and not to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In the next place, This diſcovers the efficacy of Gods grace. For muſt it not be the great power of God, as ſhall convert ſuch an obſtinate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane people to himſelf? Grace may be much acknowledged, as <hi>Pelagians</hi> did, eſpecially <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians;</hi> but it is not <hi>gratia,</hi> except it be <hi>gratuita omni modo.</hi> Therefore except we hold, that grace doth not only reveal the object, or morally perſwade the ſubject, but invincibly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently determine and incline the heart to apply it; ſo that it cometh not from the good uſe of our Free-will, but the diſcriminating power of grace, which giveth both to will and to do, we give not all, no nor the chiefeſt to grace, but make our will to be the more principal diſcriminating cauſe. We are therefore to affirm, That God converts both <hi>per modum ſapientiae,</hi> and <hi>potentiae;</hi> that Gods work upon us is <hi>Ethico-phyſical</hi> in bringing of us home unto him. It's by way of moral arguments, therefore we are not as ſtocks and ſtones; yet by way of power and invincible efficacy; therefore it is not we that make grace efficacious, but grace makes our will: And this truth is not ſo much proved by books and demonſtrations of Authours, as it is from experience. When God taketh ſometimes the worſt of men, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them the beſt of Saints: Is here any previous goodneſs? Is here any <hi>probum ingenium,</hi> or <hi>docilitas animi,</hi> that the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> talk of ſo much? No, the Scripture ſpeaks of every one in a ſtate of enmity and rebellion againſt God, when grace comes to convert them.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the Uſe be of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to all ſuch, who have felt this lively power of God raiſing them out of the grave of ſinne, who have been taught of God inwardly, as well as by the outward Miniſtry, with all joy and thankfulneſs be aſtoniſhed at the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unſearchable riches of Gods grace to thee.</hi> How many doth God paſſe by, of better parts, of greater abilities, of higher conditions in the world, that might have done him more ſervice, and pitch his love upon thee? Oh do thou abhorre all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and proud opinions of <hi>Free-will,</hi> and <hi>power to make Gods grace effectual to thee!</hi> Do not bid ſuch as bring ſuch Doctrines, <hi>God speed.</hi> What doth not thy own experience, doth not the wonderfull power of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, ſubduing and overcoming thy heart, when thou waſt full of carnal prejudices, and ſinfull reaſonings abundantly convince thee of this? Let thy own heart, and experience confirm thee more than all their ſubtill diſtinctions can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fettle thee.</p>
               <p>But I paſs from this, and come to a ſecond Obſervation, which <hi>Calvin</hi> on the place takes notice of. He calls it a <hi>Church</hi> (ſaith he) though it were ſo greatly polluted; though both for Doctrine and practice, there were ſuch great diſorders, yet for all that he doth not unchurch it, he owneth them ſtill for the people of God, though they were greatly to be reformed, as to the Church adminiſtrations; neither are his exhortations to the godly to ſeparate and leave the Church-communions, though thus defiled; he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no command to ſuch a thing, but rather exhorts them all in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to amend and reform, <hi>To purge out the old leaven that was amongſt them.</hi> Therefore to forſake polluted Aſſemblies, and leave them hopeleſs, ſeemeth to be a great neglect of our duty; we are rather to ſtay, that by our abode and preſence, we may rectifie things that are crooked. The Doctrine is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Church may be a true Church of God, although it be defiled with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Church may be a true, though defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one.</note> 
                  <hi>many corruptions ſeveral wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As a godly man may be truly godly, and yet ſubject to many failings.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48709:48"/>
Thus a Church alſo may be truly <hi>Gods Church, the Body of Chriſt,</hi> yet many diſtempers and ſad confuſions amongſt them. This truth is worthy of all diligent proſecution, becauſe many men, though otherwiſe good, out of a tenderneſs and miſguided zeal, may ſeparate from our Congregations, deny them to be true Churches, and all becauſe they ſee many things amongſt us that are matter of grief, and a great ſtumbling block to them. This I confeſs is, and hath been a ſad temptation; but a particular Chriſtian is is not to excommunicate and unchurch a Church, till God hath given a Bill of Divorce to it, and hath caſt it quite off. An impatiency to bear any evil, or diſorders in a Church, is not preſently to be commended and yielded to, to the utmoſt. A Chriſtian muſt have wiſdom, and a ſound mind, as well as zeal and a tender conſcience. Even the Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es did not wilfully and voluntarily depart from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but did ſtay to cure and heal <hi>Babylon,</hi> untill they drave them away with fire and ſword. So that our leaving the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was not a <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> ſeparation, but a forced diſceſſion or departure from them. But of this it may be more afterwards.</p>
               <p>Let us for the preſent take notice of what corruptions and diſorders were here <note place="margin">What were the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </note> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which yet he calls the <hi>Church of God.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whereas the Apoſtle comprehends all Religion in theſe things, <hi>Tit. 2. 12. Righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly. Righteouſly,</hi> in reſpect of religious duties towards God. We may ſee how the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were blame-worthy in all. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. For their <hi>ſinnes of unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> The Apoſtle ſharply reproveth them for their contentions and quarrellings, even ſo farre, that they went to Law with one another, and that in the <hi>Heathen Judicatories,</hi> which was a great and grievous reproach to the Chriſtian Religion. How would the <hi>Heathens</hi> deride and ſcoff, to ſee thoſe that were Chriſtians, and out of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance from love to heavenly things, forſaking the world and earthly advantages, thus to implead one another about <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> about money matters, or other civil rights, to ſue one another before <hi>Heathens Judges?</hi> What could this produce, but to make the <hi>Heathens</hi> ſay, They talk of leaving all, and following a crucified Chriſt, but they will not abate of their earthly rights to one another, not in the leaſt meaſure? Which did ſo grieve the Apoſtle, that he conjureth them, <hi>What have ye never a wiſe man, to be an arbitrator amongſt you? Why doe ye not rather ſuffer wrong?</hi> Nay, they were ſo farre from ſuch meek, ſelf-denying ſpirits, that they rather did wrong and defraud one another. Now ſee how <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> the Apoſtle is in this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. he ſaith, <hi>Dare any of you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a matter againſt another goe to Law?</hi> Dare any of you, ſuppoſing the Goſpel, the meekneſs of Chriſt, the ſelf-denial and contempt of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, with the ſcandal redounding to Religion, would ſufficiently awe their conſciences? Again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. he tells them, that the things pertaining to this life <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for about them they quarrelled ſo much, were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that they ſhould appoint the leaſt eſteemed in the Church for to end ſuch inferiour work. Again, <hi>verſ. 5. I ſpeak it to your ſhame:</hi> And <hi>verſ. 7. There is utterly a fault amongſt you.</hi> Thus you ſee that in matters of Juſtice between man and man, there were great offences. Only by the way, let none gather from theſe expreſſions of <hi>Paul,</hi> that it is unlawfull to go to Law, or appeal to the Civil Magiſtrate to know his due right, when that is detained from him. For that is many times ſo farre from being a ſinne, that it's a duty; it would be a ſinne not to purſue it: as you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> pleaded his right, and would not go out of priſon, when they had done it againſt Law, till the Magiſtrates came to intreat him, provided
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48709:49"/>
that there be thoſe qualifications, which <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuateth.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That this impleading be <hi>not before Heathens and Pagans,</hi> who hate the <note place="margin">How 'tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to go to Law.</note> Chriſtian Religion.</item>
                  <item>2. That we have ſuch <hi>Meekneſſe of spirit as willingly to ſuffer wrong, did not the Gospel of Chriſt, or the Law of the Land, or the good of others require it of us.</hi> And</item>
               </list>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>That we be willing to referre all our controverſies to any juſt and wiſe arbitratours.</hi> If theſe things be premiſed, and yet unreaſonable and abſurd men will make a ſpoil, and a ſcoff of men, then both Religion, and Juſtice calls them to defend themſelves, and it would be a ſin to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, for <hi>Sobriety,</hi> which is the expreſſion of ſuch graces as belong to our ſelves, <hi>viz. Temperance</hi> and <hi>Chaſtity.</hi> How groſly did the <hi>Corinthians</hi> offend here? There were ſome that had repented of their forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and uncleanneſs; and for drunkenneſs, ſome did preſume to come to the Lords Table, not freed from it. Thus you ſee many of them were rather beaſts than a Church.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, For <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> there were alſo ſad diſorders about that. There were ſome that <hi>denied the Reſurrection,</hi> that ſaid, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die;</hi> theſe were Atheiſts.

Again, Another offence in Religion was, their great Church-diviſions, ſome exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome <hi>Apollo;</hi> inſomuch that in ſtead of edifying and building up one another; they were divided into as many Sects almoſt, as they had Teachers. And then laſtly, There was horrible confuſion and ungodlineſs in reſpect of Church-order. All godly Diſcipline was laid aſide, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacraments was promiſcuous, come who would come, though in their unworthineſs, they might receive it. And although Gods judgment was upon them, either the Plague, or ſome general diſeaſe, and that becauſe no better order was about the Sacrament, yet for all that they did not judge or condemn themſelves. Thus this Church was like a very Chaos, and yet a Church ſtill.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THis Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is dignified (as you heard) with this glorious Title of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe manifeſt and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous depravations that were amongſt them, and that of all ſorts.</p>
               <p>This truth we entred upon, and before we give you ſome demonſtrations to evidence it, it is good to take notice of ſome obſervable particulars, which tend to the clearing of it. Only this muſt be premiſed, that whereas a Church may be denied to be ſo, either from its conſtitution, or from its converſation. We are ſpeaking of the later way, and ſo conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the ſoundneſs and purity of Churches doth admit of degrees:</hi> That <note place="margin">Some obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions clearing the truth, that a Church, though defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led may be the Church of God.</note> as one Starre doth excell another in glory, yet both Starres: So one Church may greatly tranſcend another in orthodoxy and purity, and yet both be Churches. In thoſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> there were ſome reproved more than others. We cannot expect that all Churches ſhould be of the ſame meaſure in knowledge and grace, no mor than particular Chriſtians: and therefore we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch a Church is no Church, becauſe not ſo pure as another Church, no more than ſuch a man is not a godly man, becauſe he hath not ſuch a meaſure of Illumination and Sanctification, as another. And to ſay in the general, That it is a Chriſtians duty to find out the pureſt Church in the world, and there to aſſociate himſelf with it, muſt needs fill a Chriſtian with infinite perplexities of conſcience; as alſo to expoſe him to inſupportable outward inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Let us not therefore do with a Church, as a godly tender heart is apt to do with himſelf, becauſe he finds many failings and great imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, therefore he is ready to judge that he hath no grace at all. Thus becauſe there are ſeveral diſorders and diſtempers in ſuch a Church, which are deſervedly daily matter of groan, and ſorrow to thee, therefore thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneſt to ſentence ſuch a <hi>Church;</hi> as no longer <hi>Gods Church.</hi> Again, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there are <hi>gradual</hi> differences of ſoundneſs and purity in Churches, this ſhould alſo make every Church take heed of <hi>appropriating the glorious name of a Church, or Saints, or Chriſtians to themſelves only, as if none were Saints or Chriſtians, but what are members of their Society.</hi> This is and hath been a moſt uncharitable proud diſpoſition of ſome Churches. The Popiſh Church ſaith, There is no ſanctity or holineſs, but with them. <hi>Inter Catholicos</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48709:50"/>
(ſaith <hi>Bellarmine) multi quidem ſunt mali, ſed inter haereticos ne uniu qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem eſt bonus.</hi> What a cenſorious condemnation is this? Not one good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant (whom they call Hereticks) not in all our Churches. Thus they only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the name of Church and ſanctity to themſelves. So the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did of old, they incloſed the Church only amongſt themſelves; they called none Chriſtians but themſelves: To become a <hi>Donatiſt</hi> was to become a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> with them. So that we ſee, it's very hard for Churches not to admire their own wayes and conſtitutions, thinking that none are Churches but themſelves; there may be <hi>phariſaical</hi> Churches, that may condemn other Churches as <hi>Publicans,</hi> as well as it is ſo in perſons; whereas it is good to obſerve, that the Scripture doth deſcribe Chriſtians by ſuch names as do not at all relate, or diſtinguiſh by any Government, or external conſtitution, to be a believer, to be a Saint, to be a Chriſtian. Theſe titles denote either ſome inward qualification or external profeſſion, but do not at all inſinuate, what kinds of order or way they are in; yet this is not ſo to be underſtood, as if Chriſts order and way, his Government and Diſcipline were an indifferent or arbitrary thing; only it is to ſhew, that we are not to <hi>monopolize</hi> godlineſs amongſt our ſelves, meerly becauſe of a Church-conſtitution, although we are not to receive any form or ſpiritual order in our Churches, but of Chriſts appointment. There is a great difference and latitude in the ſoundneſs and purity of Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When we ſpeak of a Church being Gods true Church, though greatly corrupted, we <hi>muſt take heed of two extreams,</hi> the firſt of thoſe, <hi>who therefore would have no Reformation, though there be never ſo many diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> but ſay, It's wiſdome and prudence to let all things be, as they have been, for it may be Gods Church, though there be divers abuſes. Take heed of ſuch carnal indulgence as this, becauſe it's the Church of God, therefore make no more ſtirre, let errours and prophaneneſs alone, let diſorders continue; and this many times is palliated with fair ſpecious pretences, that ſuch indeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, will breed great diſcontents and diviſions, in ſtead of having a pure Church, it may be made no Church at all, eſpecially this is the more difficulty obtained, if it be a Reformation in worſhip and manners; for we are more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſit down under an <hi>Orthodox Church,</hi> then a <hi>pure Church.</hi> We can more eaſily endure to have <hi>ſound Doctrine</hi> eſtabliſhed, then <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy Order,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this doth ſo directly contradict our luſts, and pleaſures. Hence <hi>Malachy</hi> propheſieth of Chriſts repurgation of his Church, as a very dreadfull time, even like the day of judgement, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2, 4. Chriſt is there ſaid <hi>to ſit as a refiner, and as a purger to take away dro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but who ſhall abide the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Chriſts coming being thus like the Refiners fire, and the Fullers ſope, was as terrible as the day of judgment to them, Who may abide it (ſaith he?) You ſee then orthodoxy is ſooner received than godly and holy order; but we are to know, that though we have many things to glory in, that we are a true Church, that we have excellent preaching, and many learned Officers in it, yet if there be not an endeavour to take away all offences and ſcandals, there is great matter of humiliation. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh notably in this matter to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 5. 6. Your glorying is not good,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> they gloried and boaſted in many things, but as long as they did not caſt out the old leaven, or the wicked man, but this leaven was in danger to leaven the whole lump, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he telleth them, <hi>Their glorying was not good,</hi> there was greater cauſe to be deeply humbled, becauſe of ſuch diſorders amongſt them. Let us not then, though we can and may prove our Church to be the Church of God, therefore ſit down and take our reſt, as if therefore reformation of corruptions were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: No the Apoſtle doth farre otherwiſe to this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> though he call it the Church of God, yet his Epiſtle is full of ſharp reproof to them; he is very zealous and lively in putting of them upon this, that they <hi>became a new
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48709:50"/>
lump,</hi> that they be made as it were a new Church, and a new Congregation. Farre be it therefore from us to excuſe or connive at our publick impieties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Corinth,</hi> though ſo polluted is a Church: No, we are to tremble and humble our ſelves under ſuch diſorders, they are great provocations of Gods anger. You ſee God did begin to judge and chaſten this Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> God takes notice, and is very angry with all theſe diſorders, and great neglect. Therefore if you obſerve thoſe Epiſtles of Chriſt from Heaven, to the <hi>ſeven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Aſia,</hi> where their works were not perfect, where there were any decayes; yea, if Chriſt had any thing againſt them, though there were other things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, yet he will take notice and rebuke them therein; yea, to ſome he threatens to <hi>take away their Candleſticks,</hi> that is, their Ordinances, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church them. Oh then, let us humble our ſelves under Gods hand for all our Church-ſins, all our Aſſembly-iniquities, leſt the wrath of God break out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us!</p>
               <p>The ſecond extream we are to take heed of, is, That <hi>becauſe of the corruptions that are in a Church, we are not ſo farre transported with miſguided zeal, as to take no notice of the truth of a Church.</hi> Some are apt ſo to attend to a <hi>true Church,</hi> that they never matter the <hi>corruptions of it.</hi> Others again, they do ſo eye the <hi>corruptions,</hi> that they never regard the <hi>truth</hi> of it: but it is good to avoid both theſe extreams; Whence cometh that impatiency in us to bear any evil in a Church? Whence is it that we uncharitably rend from it? Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not conſider it may be a true Church, and ſalvation is there to be had, yea converſion and regeneration, though there be many things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed? There is no Church ſo pure, but that there are ſome imperfections in it; no Church ſo reformed, but in ſome things it needeth a reformation. Thou mayeſt go from Church to Church, and be like <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Dove,</hi> not know where to ſet thy feet: if thou look for abſolute perfection in any Church whether thou goeſt. As there is no conſtitution of the body, which hath an exact tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ad pondus,</hi> but ſome humour or other doth predominate; ſo there is no Church that is of ſuch a perfect frame, but it hath its ſeveral grievances, and though it may be freed from thoſe evils they ſeparated from, yet they may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with others that are as deſtructive of a Church in a contrary way, though freed from tyranny, yet not from diviſions, and daily ſubdiviſions amongſt themſelves. So that in theſe things we are diligently to make the Scripture our Rule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though that Church be a true Church where we live, yet if many corruptions do abound therein, we muſt take heed, <hi>That we do not pollute our ſelves thereby, or become partakers of any ſinne indulged amongst them.</hi> As we may not ſinfully ſeparate upon this ground, becauſe they are no Church, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we continue ſo, as to pollute and defile our ſelves with any known ſin. The Apoſtles exhortation to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> under theſe manifold pollutions, is, that every one in their proper place, ſhould endeavour their new moulding. So that under Church-pollutions, thou art to conſider, what God cals thee to do, to rebuke, exhort, admoniſh; and if this will not do, to complain to Church-Officers, who are to guide and watch over the flock; and if yet this will not do, then to be the more earneſt with God in prayer, to bring about Reformation notwithſtanding all the gainſayings of wicked men: To mourn and ſigh unto God, as a <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom, vexing thy righteous ſoul continually;</hi> as a <hi>lamenting Jeremiah</hi> among the <hi>apoſtatizing Iſraelites.</hi> And certainly God doth in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner take notice of ſuch, who do mourn for thoſe abominations, that they cannot remove or take away, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. when thou canſt appeal to God, ſaying, O Lord, theſe corruptions, theſe diſorders, they grieve me to the very heart! I cry out daily, <hi>Wo be unto me, becauſe I dwell with men of polluted lips.</hi> This will much ingage God to thee. Likewiſe we read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 4. in what a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48709:51"/>
manner God takes notice of <hi>a few names in Sardis, which had not defiled their garments.</hi> To be therefore in the midſt of a defiled Church, and yet to keep thy ſelf unſpotted, this is admirable; as they record of the river <hi>Alpheus,</hi> which though it runne into the Sea, yet it keeps its own natural ſweetneſs; though we have communion with the Church in thoſe things, that are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, yet we are not to partake with them in any evil way: as thoſe <hi>ſeven thouſand</hi> in <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us demonſtrate this, that a Church may be Gods Church, <note place="margin">Reaſons ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of it.</note> though it be greatly corrupted. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, It may be ſeen from the <hi>induction of ſeveral Churches;</hi> as for example, the <hi>Church of the Jews,</hi> they were Gods people, and God did own them as his; yet, as appeareth by the Prophets complaints and daily reproofs, they were full of <hi>Idolatries</hi> and all <hi>moral impieties;</hi> and for all this, there were many repentings and turnings in Gods bowels, to ſpeak after the manner of men, before he would call them <hi>Lo-ammi, a people no more to him.</hi> But you may ſay, That was in the Old Teſtament, when the Spirit of God was not poured out ſo effectually. Conſider then beſides, this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> were not they farre infected with doctrinal pollutions and vicious luſts of the fleſh? That the Apoſtle mentioneth not any where, ſuch zeal and ſharpneſs as he doth to them, threatning them with <hi>Apoſtaſie from Chriſt,</hi> and that <hi>having begun in the Spirit, they would end in the fleſh.</hi> We might inſtance alſo in ſeveral other Churches: But as the Father ſaid elegantly, <hi>We need not drink up the whole Sea, to know whether the water be ſaltiſh; a drop or two will ſuffice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This may be demonſtrated <hi>from the relation and compariſon, the Church is adorned with, in reference to Chriſt.</hi> It's often compared to <hi>Chriſts wife;</hi> now the wife continueth a true wife, and is not to be deſerted, unleſs for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,</hi> which breaketh the conjugal knot; otherwiſe though ſhe have many ſad infirmities, which may make the relation bitter and uncomfortable, yet it doth not unwiſe her. The Church is alſo <hi>Chriſts body;</hi> now a body is not forſaken by the ſoul, though it be a ſore body, a leprous body; a leper is a man, though a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: It's <hi>Chriſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arden;</hi> now this may have many weeds in it, and many things defile it, yet it is not preſently made a waſte wilderneſs. Thus it is with the Church of God, ſhe may have many failings in Doctrine and manners, yet not be quite unchurched.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>From a godly man.</hi> A true child of God may have ſad falls, as we ſee in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> yet for all this not be quite excluded out of the Covenant of grace; they did not loſe their ſonſhip, even in thoſe ſad tranſgreſſions, and will God be more ſevere to a whole Church than to one perſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction,</hi> what a deal of prudence and wiſdome is required in every godly man under Church-pollutions? To know what to do, to underſtand how to deport himſelf; for this he muſt be guided by the Word, and the adviſe of thoſe that are faithfull, on the one hand, not to be ſtupid or careleſs, much leſs complying and communicating with the Church defilements; and on the other ſide, not to be ſo tranſported with miſguided zeal and impatiency againſt evil, as there by to rend the Church cauſleſly, and to ſin our ſelves, becauſe others ſin.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle owneth nothing in this famous City, but their faith, their profeſſion of Chriſt, and ſubjection to him. A Church is a ſupernatural Society, for ſupernatural and ſpiritual ends, where God is in a more ſpecial manner preſent; and therefore though the civil Magiſtrate be alſo <hi>of God,</hi> and civil Societies they are <hi>of him,</hi> yet not in that peculiar relation as a Church is. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 87. 2. The Lord loveth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

in all that Epiſtle takes no notice of the glory of that City, which was the <hi>Orbis Domina,</hi> and which they uſually called <hi>aeterna Urbs;</hi> he mentioneth their faith, <hi>which was known to the whole world,</hi> Rom. 1. 8. not the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and warlike power whereby they were ſo terrible to all Nations. It is good to conſider this; for how few Churches do eſteem of, or judge themſelves by their Church conſideration, but by their civil reſpects? As they are ſuch a City, ſuch a Corporation, glorying in their Liberties and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whereas the conſideration of themſelves as a Church, ſhould far more poſſeſs their hearts.</p>
               <p>Briefly to underſtand this, conſider</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Church and Commonwealth, or any civil Society, are two diſtinct things; the Church is one thing, and the State another thing.</hi> In the times of <hi>Heathen Magistrates,</hi> and while there was outward perſecution, by the civil Powers which then ruled, it's plain; for the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time were wholly different. So at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the civil Magiſtracy of the Town did not ſeem to be Chriſtians, the Corporation of the Town was not (as I may ſay) made a Church. The Chriſtian Religion was not at this time eſtabliſhed in <hi>Corinth</hi> by the City-Laws and Government; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many in <hi>Corinth</hi> were become believers. So that it's plain, The ſame <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as they were a Church, lived by other Laws, and by different principles, then as members of the City of <hi>Corinth.</hi> As he was a Citizen, ſo he met in their civil Judicatories, ſo he acted according to the Laws of the City (provided nothing was againſt Gods command) but as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church there, ſo they meet with others in ſpiritual communion, for holy and ſpiritual ends. Thus it is in a State, while they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Heatheniſh.</hi> But ſome have doubted, <hi>Whether if a Commonwealth become Chriſtian, then there is any difference there between the Church and ſuch a Chriſtian State? Whether then they are not all one?</hi> But certainly by the firſt Inſtitution, and plantation of <hi>Churches,</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles, Churches</hi> were founded and imbodied; their Officers, imploiment, and the end of their Society appointed, without any relation to the civil State and Government where they lived. And therefore a Chriſtian State, doth not civilly govern, nor bear the Sword, puniſhing with death; neither are there ſupream Governours, Lords or Noblemen in it, as a <hi>Church;</hi> for then theſe ſhould be Church-officers, and inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> a <hi>Juſtice of Peace</hi> is not of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a <hi>Paſtor in the Church.</hi> Neither on the other ſide are the preaching of the Word, the adminiſtration of Sacraments, the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Church-cenſures, the effects of a Chriſtian State, but as a Church. So that it's neceſſary by Scripture to acknowledge theſe two, a <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>State,</hi> as two diſtinct Societies, though the ſame men may be members of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It's a moſt bleſſed thing, when the civil State and Church are happily united together, ſo that both in their ſeveral ſtations do promote the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> There are extremities on both ſides, ſome exclude all civil Government from the matters of the Church or Religion; as if the Magiſtrate, and the civil power had nothing to do to appoint any thing in reference to theſe ſpiritual matters, which if ſo, then <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> could not be <hi>nurſing Fathers and Mothers in the Church;</hi> Then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhould not be the <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabulae;</hi> then holy Magiſtrates ſhould ſinne in reforming abuſes and corruptions which are crept into the Church of God, which yet <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> did; and ſo likewiſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> did, to his great praiſe, ſaying to the Officers of the Church, he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He had an external Epiſcopacie and Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:48709:52"/>
Then in the ſecond place, there is another extream errour, which is to <hi>confound the State and the Church,</hi> as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had appointed no diſtinct Officers or work, but that any man authorized by a commiſſion from the civil power, was hereby inabled to do any Office in the Church, and that Chriſt had not ſet <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Teachers in his Church,</hi> but civil Governours. Now how bleſſed and happy hath it been, when theſe Societies have been friendly complying, and furthering one another. The Commonwealth help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and furthering, defending and protecting the Church: The Church alſo performing all Church-Ordinances, in ſuch a manner, that God may bleſs that ſtate, and make it to be as <hi>Obed-Edoms</hi> houſe, while he entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ark, <hi>Quamdiu respublicae manent hoſpitia Eccleſiae tamdiu ſuns duraturae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence in the third place, <hi>The Devil and his inſtruments have alwayes laboured the ruine of godlineſs, by making diviſions, and uſing ſeveral ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems to overthrow the harmonious Unity that ought to be in the Church of God, and civil State.</hi> In Popery, we ſee abominable miſchief came to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the uſurping of the name of the Church; for they excluded the Magiſtrates and ſupream Governours, from any Government therein, and at laſt pleading exemption from all Obedience and Subjection to the chief powers, though ſo expreſly contrary to <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13. Thus they make a few only, yea but one, the <hi>Pope</hi> at laſt, to be the Church, and then attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him a power to diſpoſe of Kingdoms and States, where and to whom he pleaſeth, <hi>directly and immediately,</hi> ſay ſome; and thoſe who do moſt mince it ſay, <hi>indirectè,</hi> and <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia.</hi> On the other ſide, ſometimes the civil State hath been jealous, yea and violently perſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Church of God, as if that of <hi>Julian</hi> were true, <hi>A Church and a civil Society could not ſtand together;</hi> as if Chriſt had commanded ſuch things of his Church, that were inconſiſtent with, and would utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all civil Government. Thus <hi>Pilate,</hi> he was jealous, becauſe he heard of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom;</hi> and although it be known that his <hi>Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> that Church power is wholly ſpiritual in order to mens ſouls, yet how often are the Governours ſuſpicious about it? But theſe particulars are of large conſideration, and handled by learned Authours. I come therefore to ſhew, That a peoples conſideration of themſelves as a Church, ſhould be preferred above all their civil Glory and Dignity. <hi>It ought to be more</hi> (as one Emperour ſaid) <hi>to be a Member of the Church, then an Emperour of the whole world.</hi> The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> time, while pure in the faith, was more admirable, then the <hi>City of Rome,</hi> which was Queen over the whole world.</p>
               <p>The Grounds why we are to give this preheminence to a <hi>Church-</hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, <note place="margin">Reaſons ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of it.</note> are</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe a Church-conſtitution is ſupernatural, all is of God in a more ſpecial manner, then in civil Societies.</hi> For although all civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be of God, and the making of civil Societies, of making Nations and Kingdoms be in an extraordinary manner attributed to him in the Scripture, yet ſtill this is in <hi>the courſe of Nature,</hi> but a <hi>Church</hi> is planted by <hi>the grace of God,</hi> and it's above the work of Nature, either ordinary or extraordinary, to be made ſuch a Society.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As we are a Church, we have the neareſt relation and refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God;</hi> not as a <hi>City,</hi> or a <hi>Corporation</hi> are, but as a <hi>Church</hi> are we his <hi>Houſe,</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> his <hi>Vinyard.</hi> Neither can we expect ſuch preſence of God in our civil Aſſemblies and Judicatories, as in Church-meetings. The power and grace of God is in a more powerfull and ſpecial manner diſcovering it ſelf there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:48709:53"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Hereby we have greater Titles, and more noble Dignity;</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it's true in the account of the world, nothing is more contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The <hi>Church</hi> is called the <hi>Kingdom of God;</hi> we are hereby the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God;</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Grace is made with us.</hi> So that all who are not of the <hi>Church,</hi> be they never ſuch glorious, victorious, and wiſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet <hi>they are without God,</hi> and <hi>they are under the Kingdom of Satan,</hi> whereas <hi>Gods Church is the Object of his love,</hi> there he is ſaid to <hi>delight to dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction to Believers, who are the Church of God, to conſider</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that title and relation they are in as ſuch.</hi> Though great, though rich, though honourable, yet let it not be accounted equal to the being one of <hi>Gods Church.</hi> If the <hi>Devil</hi> ſhould ſhew thee the glory of all the world, promiſing to beſtow it on thee, upon condition thou renounceſt thy Church intereſt, and Church memberſhip, with great indignation refuſe it. What high eſteem was put upon the being a <hi>Roman Citizen? Paul</hi> ſtood upon his <hi>Roman freedom</hi> in a particular caſe; but this is nothing to be of that free City, which is <hi>Jeruſalem from above,</hi> even in this Earth. By medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on this, thou wilt be more thankfull to God, that he hath made thee one of his Church, than if he had given all the <hi>Turkiſh Empire</hi> to thee, for that is but as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>Mica cani,</hi> a crum to the dog, in reſpect of the childrens bread.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The conſideration of a Church-priviledge and intereſt, will make thee moſt to attend to that, in dispoſing and ſetling thy ſelf, when at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> Moſt people look to live, where the beſt trading is, the greateſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, or beſt earthly accommodation. But if thou art one free to ſettle thy ſelf where thou mayeſt; thou that feareſt God will look upon Church advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as the greateſt glory and profit of all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>This will take off all thoſe general thoughts, which do almoſt reign every where, to conſider of men by their Cities and Townes, not by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> 
                  <hi>their Churches;</hi> It's the <hi>Town</hi> at ſuch a place, the <hi>Corporation</hi> at ſuch a place, but no attending to that place, as it is a <hi>Church of God.</hi> Hence it is that we are wholly drowned in the thoughts of our ſelves, as a Town, as a Pariſh in civil reſpects, but never conſidering the relation of a Church, and what duties we are obliged unto thereby.</p>
               <p>The two other Obſervations are to be diſpatched in a little room, as <note place="margin">Why <hi>Paul</hi> writeth this ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>
                  </note> from the Apoſtles writing a ſecond time to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which he ſeldom did to any Church, but to that of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> a ſingle perſon. One reaſon whereof amongſt others, was, becauſe that his former Epiſtle had taken ſome good effect; and whereas they had been too remiſs before about their indulgence to that inceſtuous perſon, it ſeemeth this Epiſtle had now ſo awakened them, that they began to be too ſevere to him, though repenting and humbling himſelf, as appeareth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 6, 7. whereupon he exhorteth them, <hi>To comfort him, leſt he be ſwallowed up with too much ſorrow.</hi> It's true, there were other reaſons, why he wrote this ſecond Epiſtle, but this is one amongſt the reſt. From whence we might obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it's very hard for the Churches of God to keep within their proper bounds about Church-adminiſtrations.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is very hard for the Church of God to keep within their proper bounds in Church-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more ordinary, than to fall from one extream to another. Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> that were ſo negligent in good order, that many pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſuffered amongſt them; inſomuch that Gods judgements had ſurprized them for their default herein. Now when awakened to do their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48709:53"/>
duty, they are ready to overdo, and from too much remiſneſs, to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to too much ſeverity. Thus in many other things we might inſtance, how the Churches of God have fallen from one extremity to another; but this ſubject, eſpecially as it relateth to Church-Diſcipline will be more ſutably treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>I therefore briefly raiſe a third Obſervation, and that is from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>care, and zeal to build up the Church of God.</hi> For whereas he could not come to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as yet, leſt any Church-corruption or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders ſhould ariſe thereby, he endeavours by writing to do that in his abſence, which he would not do by his preſence. From whence we may gather,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it's the Miniſters duty, not only by perſonal preaching, but by all other</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is a Miniſters duty to uſe all lawfull means to promote the Church he hath relation to.</note> 
                  <hi>lawfull wayes to promote that Church, he hath any relation unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> cannot preach, he will write. This zeal in <hi>Paul</hi> drew out thoſe many Epiſtles, that now we have recorded in Scripture. Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh notably to this, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 17, 18. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1. where he ſheweth his cordial affections towards that people, with what violence he was kept from them; and becauſe <hi>Satan hindered him,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>He could no longer forbear, but would be left at Athens alone,</hi> without any comfort or ſolace, rather than not to ſend to them, that ſo they might not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Goſpel. Thus at other times we ſee this glorious Apoſtle, when preſent, yet not contented with his publick preaching, did from houſe to houſe, as occaſion ſerved with tears, beſeech and teſtifie every one to cleave unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>From this example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who though an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and ſo not bound to attend on particular Churches, yet did by letters confirm and quicken thoſe Churches he had planted. We ſee how great and grievous a ſinne a <hi>voluntary and unneceſſary non-reſidence</hi> is, in thoſe Paſtours, who by their Office are bound to a particular Flock, and to watch over them. For though in ſome weighty caſes for the good of the whole Church they may be detained from their Flock, yet voluntarily and ſlothfully to do this, will at laſt be found a grievous ſoul-murdering ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. To reprove that people, who complain of too much preaching, and too much miniſterial imploiment, thinking it needleſs.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>WE are now arrived at the laſt clauſe in this verſe, which containeth a more general Deſcription of thoſe to whom he directs this Epiſtle. Some Epiſtles are called <hi>Catholick,</hi> becauſe not inſcribed to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches or perſons, but to the whole Church of God. Others are more <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>local,</hi> as this to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yet we ſee it's not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them; but that alſo, all the adjacent Saints are comprehended in it. Yea, though <hi>Paul</hi> and others wrote their Epiſtles to certain Churches and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet they are in ſome ſenſe <hi>Catholick;</hi> for they all were written as a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Rule to the whole Church of God, in all ages. So that this Epiſtle doth concern even the Churches of God in other Nations, as well as that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when guilty of ſuch diſorder.</p>
               <p>So that in the Inſcription, which is more general than the former clauſe, we may take notice,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the Perſons to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, and they are deſcribed by their qualifications, <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. By a Note of Univerſality, <hi>All the Saints.</hi> There is none ſo mean or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, but the Apoſtle writeth as well to ſuch a poor contemptible Saint, as well as to the greateſt and moſt eminent.</item>
                  <item>3. There is the place where, <hi>Which are in all Achaia.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I ſhall firſt conſider the Qualification, <hi>Saints.</hi> He giveth this title to all that were of this Church; even as in the former Epiſtle, he ſaith, <hi>They were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now the Queſtion is, <hi>How the Apoſtle could give the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle could call the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Saints, when many of them were ſo foully pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.</note> 
                  <hi>of Saints to to all the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>with thoſe in</hi> Achaia; <hi>for they both ſeem guilty of the ſame ſins; and therefore from this Epiſtle directed to them, when yet they were ſo foully polluted. Was the inceſtuous perſon, before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented? Were thoſe unclean perſons, that had not humbled themſelves for their ſins, and</hi> Paul <hi>was afraid he ſhould find them ſuch when he came? Were thoſe Saints? Were ſuch, who</hi> denied the Reſurrection, <hi>yea</hi> that had no knowledge of God, <hi>as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid of ſome, to whoſe ſhame he ſpake it, were theſe Saints?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old anſwered, and ſo ſome of late, <hi>That the Apoſtle ſpeaks this generally of the whole body, becauſe ſome amongst them were Saints. The denomination being from the moſt worthy part.</hi> So that they conclude of this as a Rule to interpret Scripture by, <hi>To underſtand that of ſome parts, which yet is attributed to to the whole.</hi> And for this reaſon (they ſay) it is, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle writing to ſome Churches, as to this of <hi>Corinth,</hi> doth ſometimes ſpeak of them, as if they were all godly; and at another time, he reproveth them ſo, as if they were all blame-worthy. Thus becauſe ſome were Saints indeed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48709:54"/>
he writeth to the whole Church, as if Saints; as we call a field of corn by that name, though there may be many weeds and bryars amongſt it. This hath ſome truth, but yet this is not all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be thought that the Apoſtle calls them Saints, <hi>in the judgment of charity,</hi> becauſe they did outwardly profeſs their faith and obedience in Chriſt, even as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 12. <hi>A faithfull brother, as I ſuppoſe;</hi> but a judgement of charity muſt be according to truth, and he knew that all in <hi>Corinth</hi> were not truly Saints. And as for that expreſſion of <hi>Pauls</hi> concerning <hi>Sylvanus; Calvin, Eſtius</hi> and others, do not relate the phraſe (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to a <hi>faithfull brother,</hi> but to the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the few things,</hi> or <hi>briefly,</hi> as added for <hi>Modeſty ſake;</hi> and indeed if it were related to <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> it would not commend his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but rather give occaſion to doubt of it. But if we attribute it to <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſignifieth a firm and undoubted judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon good conſideration, therefore our <hi>Engliſh</hi> word <hi>(ſuppoſe)</hi> doth not ſo well anſwer it.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the third place, That diſtinction of a <hi>Saint</hi> by <hi>external profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>dedication to God thereby,</hi> and by <hi>internal and ſpiritual renovation</hi> is the moſt genuine to anſwer this doubt. Some were Saints by <hi>inward regeneration;</hi> Others were Saints by <hi>external profeſſion</hi> and <hi>outward ſubmiſſion;</hi> ſo that they had not as yet renounced their Chriſtianity; and this ſenſe the Apoſtle plainly makes, when he gives that oppoſition between <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 1. Dare any of you go to law before the unjuſt,</hi> that is, the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>not before Saints?</hi> where <hi>Saint</hi> is oppoſed to an Heathen. So <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. a <hi>brother,</hi> which is all one with a <hi>Saint,</hi> is oppoſed to an <hi>unbeliever.</hi> All that came out of the world to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt, are called <hi>Saints and believers,</hi> though even amongſt them all were not godly. Now you muſt know, that there are degrees of godlineſs,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is that which is <hi>ſupream</hi> and <hi>infinite,</hi> and thus God is <hi>holy, holy, holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>created bolineſs,</hi> and that either <hi>perfect,</hi> ſuch as the humane Nature of Chriſt, the Angels and glorified Saints in Heaven have, or elſe <hi>imperfect,</hi> ſubject to many imperfections and weakneſſes. Hence ſaith <hi>Salmeron, We dare not call any man a Saint, while be liveth on this earth, till he be conſummated;</hi> but that is abſurd; for to be a <hi>Saint</hi> is no more than to be <hi>holy;</hi> ſo that if we may call any <hi>holy,</hi> we may alſo call them <hi>Saints,</hi> as our Tranſlators do for the moſt part render the word. The Papiſts indeed they call only thoſe that are canonized <hi>Saints,</hi> who are already in Heaven; therefore thoſe that lived in the Old Teſtament, becauſe of their opinion of their being in <hi>Limbo Patrum,</hi> they are never in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> called Saints, they never ſay Saint <hi>David,</hi> or Saint <hi>Iſaiah. Salmeron</hi> alſo obſerveth from this title of Saints given to all believers, That in the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the Church (ſaith he) all were called Saints, in the <hi>Adoleſcentiâ,</hi> only the Biſhops, and Officers in the Church, but in <hi>Senectute,</hi> only thoſe that are tranſlated into Heaven. But we muſt conform to Scripture, not humane ſpeculations. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48709:55"/>
Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. we have that expreſſion, <hi>called Saints,</hi> that is, either called to be Saints, holineſs being the term to which of their vocation; or <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was by his calling an <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> Both theſe tend to the ſame thing, and all oblige to holineſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us conſider, how much this <hi>Church-Saintſhip</hi> doth comprehend, <note place="margin">What is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under Church Saintſhip.</note> what degrees and ſteps it hath. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth imply, <hi>Their being under the external dispenſation of Gods Covenant of Grace.</hi> All that are under the Covenant adminiſtration, are thereby <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> though all are not regenerated. Upon this account it is, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of one, or more believing Parents are called <hi>holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. where to be under the Covenant is enough to give this denomination of holy. And hence it is, that all the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> among whom there were many prophane and unholy perſons, in reſpect of inward Sanctity, are yet called all of them <hi>Saints,</hi> becauſe the Covenant-diſpenſation was towards them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 2. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> complaineth, <hi>That the enemies had given the fleſh of his Saints to the beaſts of the earth,</hi> where the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> deſtroyed by their enemies, are all called <hi>Saints.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 5, 7. the aſſembly of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> wherein alſo <hi>David</hi> did meet to praiſe God, is called, the <hi>Aſſembly of the Saints.</hi> Now we cannot think, that every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> who came to ſacrifice and ſerve God was truly holy. Yea <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. God complaineth of ſuch, <hi>Who came and took his name into their mouth, and yet hated to be reformed.</hi> Therefore they are called Saints, becauſe they are all under the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Church-Saintſhip conſiſts in a dedication, and conſecrating our ſelves unto God.</hi> For our Baptiſm is the initial Sacrament, and by it we are externally ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and ſet apart to God from the Devil, ſinne and the world. For as in the Old Teſtament, there were by certain ceremonial Rites, dedicating of perſons and things to God, which thereby had a relative holineſs, and ſo were called holy, becauſe dedicated; Thus though with ſome diſſimilitude, by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, we are baptized into <hi>the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt;</hi> which amongſt other things, ſignifieth this alſo, that we are given up to God from the world and the Devil, to be no more theirs, not to live according to their courſe and way. And for this reaſon it is that thoſe who are not of the Church, are ſaid to be <hi>without,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. and the world is diſtinct to the Church, when therefore of the Church, we are not of the world; we are not without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kingdom of Satan, but we are of the body of Chriſt, of his houſe; and our Baptiſm doth ſacramentally denote our communion with Chriſt. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all that are baptized do not in deed and in truth put on Jeſus Chriſt, yet as long as they do not renounce their Baptiſm, ſo long by that there is an outward dedication of them to God. And thus that Apoſtate ſpoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. who never had true grace, yet is ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified by the bloud of the Covenant,</hi> whereof the Sacraments are ſeals. So that our ſacramental relation doth give an outward denomination of a Saint, or an holy perſon, though if there be no inward holineſs, the condemnation of ſuch will be farre more dreadfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, than of the vileſt and worſt of Heathens.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Church-Saintſhip goeth a further ſtep, and that is, <hi>An external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith in Chriſt, and ſubmiſſion unto his will.</hi> For a Church being a viſible Society, there muſt be ſome external and viſible ſign, whereby we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate our ſelves to be of the Church. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. it's ſaid, That <hi>with the mouth confeſſion is made to ſalvation.</hi> There may be many ſecret and hidden Atheiſts in the Church of God, yet becauſe they do externally profeſs the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, therefore it is that they are of the Church, in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and viſible ſtate of it. Thus <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and others, while they did profeſs their faith in Chriſt, they were under the name of a Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and ſo of Saints.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48709:55"/>
4. There is yet a further degree in this Church-Saintſhip, and that is, <hi>When beſides this ſacramental and external holineſs, there are ſome workings of Gods Spirit upon their ſouls.</hi> So that the Chriſtian Religion hath ſome kind of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon them. They are not only <hi>titular Saints,</hi> but they have ſome kind of inchoate and imperfect workings of Gods Spirit upon their ſouls, which have a tendency to godlineſs, or at leaſt a reſemblance and ſhew of it. So that in the opinion of others, and many times in their own perſwaſions likewiſe, they are true Saints. Now theſe may well enough be ſtiled <hi>Saints,</hi> becauſe the Scripture attributes to them ſuch acts as have the <hi>name of holineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary believer likened to the thorny ground, is ſaid to <hi>have faith,</hi> and to <hi>receive the Word with joy.</hi> Some are ſaid in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>To eſcape the pollutions of the world.</hi> Yea <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. ſome are ſaid to <hi>be enlightned, to have taſted the good Word of God, to partake of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. and yet for all that, ſuch were never true Saints. For ſuch that are ſo, can no more finally apoſtatize than true ſtarres can fall from the Heavens. Comets and blazing Stars may have a great luſtre for a while, but being compoſed of terreſtrial exhalations, at laſt they fall into the womb of that Earth from whence they ſprang. Thus thoſe, who have only ſome imperfect, common works of Gods Spirit, abounding in gifts, and many admirable abilities, theſe may ſeem in Saintſhip to exceed many that are truly ſo; but becauſe there was never true and deep rooting, when the ſtorms and tempeſts ſhall ariſe, this glorious building will not have ſo much as a <hi>ſtone left upon a ſtone.</hi> Thoſe uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Teachers, injurious to the grace of God, that do ſo peremptorily dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize the Apoſtaſie of the Saints, do yet never bring ſuch Texts of Scripture or inſtances, that do neceſſarily prove thoſe to be true Saints that are ſpoken of. <hi>Saul</hi> was never a true Saint, <hi>Judas</hi> was never a true Saint, and ſo no wonder of <hi>hopefull beginnings,</hi> degenerated into ſuch <hi>tragical</hi> and <hi>horrid beginnings.</hi> Now whereas the former mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are only baptized, that give an external ſubmiſſion to Chriſts Laws eſpecially, if (as too many do) wallowing in all the wayes of the fleſh, and carnal exceſs, if theſe (I ſay) may by all be proclaimed to be no real, but nominal Saints, all the world ſeeth they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in name, but beaſts and devils in reſpect of real <hi>Saintſhip.</hi> Yet the great difficulty, and the conſtant wiſdome of a Chriſtian is exerciſed about the diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this later holineſs from that which is true. To know, when I am gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than any hypocrite or reprobate can attain unto. This as we are greatly to ſtudy and examine our ſelves in; ſo we are to know that it is better to be deceived in any worldly matter than in this.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The ultimate and moſt compleat ſtep of Church-Saintſhip in this life, is, <hi>When we go beyond all the former, and are made partakers of the Spirit of God, in the powerfull renovation of us, ſo that from that holy, and new creature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, our lives and actions are made really and ſolidly holy.</hi> And this is indeed the true and proper Saintſhip, to which only the promiſe of Juſtification and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is made. So that if thou didſt enjoy the greateſt Church-priviledges, yea, and the moſt admirable gifts therein; yet if deſtitute of this Saintſhip, thou art but a <hi>tinkling cymbal,</hi> and the hotteſt place in hell will be filled with ſuch ſeeming Saints.</p>

                  <p>External Holineſs is not enough to bring us to Heaven, without the inward renovation of the Heart.</p>

                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 1.</bibl>

               <p>VVE have heard what is the laſt and ultimate ſtep in <hi>Church-Saintſhip,</hi> without which all the former, though they be in themſelves great mercies, yet becauſe we take them in vain, do become in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the number of thoſe, whom God will not hold guiltleſs. They are (I ſay) <note place="margin">External holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not enough to bring us to Heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole man.</note> in themſelves great mercies. For when we are thus called by God, unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means of holineſs, there is ſome hope, and a poſſible way for ſalvation, whereas without this, there is neceſſary deſtruction. It is here, as in blind <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timeus</hi> his caſe, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 49. for when Chriſt commanded him to be called to him, preſently ſome ſaid to the blind man, <hi>Be of good comfort, he calleth thee;</hi> that was a good encouragement, Chriſt called him: ſo whereas there are many thouſands in the world that are left alone in their ſtate of darkneſs, but he vouchſafeth the means of grace to thee. We may ſay, <hi>Be of good comfort, there is ſome hopes, Chriſt calleth thee;</hi> yet becauſe <hi>many are called, and of thoſe many called, few are choſen,</hi> therefore this external holineſs and Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not enough, unleſs there be the inward renovation of the whole man. Unleſs thou art holy <hi>inwardly,</hi> as well as <hi>outwardly,</hi> this will make to thy greater condemnation. That therefore which is the eſſential form, and gives a conſtr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive being to <hi>Church-Saintſhip,</hi> is <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the <hi>work of grace upon a mans heart.</hi> Indeed to an external ſtate, and viſible condition of Church-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a profeſſion of faith, with ſubmiſſion unto Chriſts wayes is enough; but that which maketh us indeed members of the body of Chriſt, and inveſts us with right to all ſaving benefits, that is only this inward real Saintſhip. And to clear this more, you muſt take notice;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That even in real Saintſhip there is a great latitude and difference.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Propoſitions clearing the aſſertion, 1. There are degrees even in real Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> All are not Saints alike. The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>babes,</hi> of <hi>young men,</hi> of <hi>old men.</hi> It ſpeaks of ſome that are <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> others are <hi>imperfect,</hi> and even <hi>carnal,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. comparatively: ſo that we muſt alwayes diſtinguiſh between the truth of grace, and the degrees of it. A Saint is a Saint, though but a bruiſed reed, and a ſmoaking flax. This is good to be obſerved, that we may not judge of Saintſhip by ſuch degrees, and high attainments, but by truth and ſincerity. No, there will be alwayes difference both in Illumination and Sanctification, and that amongſt the Saints themſelves. And this ſhould teach a mutual bearing and forbearing of one another. Let not him that is <hi>ſtrong,</hi> who doth farre ſurpaſs others, though true Saints, in gifts and graces, deſpiſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48709:56"/>
and contemn ſuch as are below them, to judge them no Saints, or not godly at all. That there is ſuch a diſpoſition even in grown Saints, appeareth <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. where the Apoſtle giveth ſeveral Rules to ſtrong Chriſtians, eſpecially, <hi>That they judge not, or despiſe him that is weak;</hi> and one reaſon amongſt others is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath received him.</hi> If therefore he be one, whom God hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for whom Chriſt died, though ſubject to many weakneſſes and infirmities take heed of contemning him. Such a ſupercilious, cenſorious ſpirit, is farre from the Spirit of Chriſt, who when he ſaw one not farre from the Kingdom of Heaven, though not yet in it, yet it's ſaid, <hi>He loved him,</hi> and encouraged him.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>This real Saintſhip is alwayes growing, and ought</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Therefore is real Saintſhip alway grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this life.</note> 
                  <hi>to be more and more proficient continually.</hi> It is an high deluſion to dream of ſuch a perfection, that they are above Ordinances, that they are of ſo full a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in grace, that one cubit cannot be added to them. This is to let the Devil get thee up to the pinacle of the Temple, and then to throw thee headlong into hell; yet ſuch ſad deluſions have been on ſome, that coming to the Sacrament, they have ſaid, They have had as perfect love as Chriſt himſelf. But this is againſt the continual current of the Scripture, which preſſeth to <hi>grow in grace,</hi> to <hi>bring forth more fruit.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. to <hi>perfect holineſſe in the fear of God. Paul</hi> himſelf, though a Gyant, to us Dwarfs, yet <hi>Phil. 3. Accounted not himſelf to have apprehended, but forgat what was behind, and preſſed forward to the mark. Cloppenburge</hi> a learned man thinketh, <hi>That even Chriſt himſelf did feed and nouriſh his ſoul by meditating on Gods Word, and that in the uſe of the Sacraments, his faith was more confirmed, for to go through that work of redemption for us.</hi> This may ſeem hard to affirm of Chriſt, <hi>who had the Spirit without meaſure.</hi> But it is very true of every Saint on Earth, though never ſo exalted and enabled by grace, that he needeth the Ordinances, that he is to perfect and fill up that vacuity and emptineſs, which is in him; ſo that he may ſay with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when going to be ſacrificed for the truth, <hi>Nune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio eſſe Chriſtianus; I do even now begin to be a Chriſtian;</hi> to be a Saint, I am but a babe yet, I am but a beginner yet.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Church-Saintſhip therefore doth conſiſt with many imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Church-Saintſhip though real conſiſteth with many imperfections.</note> 
                  <hi>and weakneſſes, ſo that we need a conſtant and daily remiſſion of ſinne through the bloud of Chriſt.</hi> This is greatly to be obſerved, becauſe ſome have dreamed of ſuch a perfection in this life, that if not alway, yet for ſome time, we may be without any ſinne at all; and therefore they tell us of Saints in the Church which need no pardon or forgiveneſs; as if to be a Saint in the Church, and a Saint in Heaven were all one: but our Saviour in directing all to pray <hi>for the forgiveneſſe of ſin</hi> (I ſay all that are to pray, are to pray ſo) doth plainly confute this. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith, That <hi>if we ſay we have no ſinne in us, we deceive our ſelves;</hi> and indeed we ſinne in ſaying ſo. And this is the more to be obſerved, becauſe the dear children of God think this title of <hi>Saint</hi> too glorious and great to apply to themſelves, who are compaſſed about with ſuch infirmities. How can I be called a Saint, and yet ſo dull, ſo ſluggiſh, ſo froward, earthly, and often diſordered in heart? But you are to know, that though Saints, yet we are not to be juſtified by our Saintſhip; we need the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, to cover the imperfections of our Saintſhip; yea ſome have not loſt their <hi>Saintſhip,</hi> and yet have fallen into foul ſins for a ſeaſon. <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others, did not ceaſe to be Saints in thoſe ſad falls, though their holineſs was drawn inward, and as the juice of the Tree in the Winter, was hid in the root under ground; but theſe Suns were not alwayes in an eclipſe, at laſt they did recover to their greater advantage in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to be a pillar of ſalt to all other Saints, <hi>Nor to be high-minded, but fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48709:57"/>
Fourthly, <hi>To be a Saint is a denomination from our conformity to the will of God, as a rule of our lives.</hi> So that if you ask, What is it to be a <hi>Saint?</hi> It is <note place="margin">4. Holineſs or Saintſhip is the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the will of man to the will of God.</note> to be <hi>one born again by the Spirit of God, making the word of God to be the rule of all his actions.</hi> So that Gods Word muſt try, whether thou art a <hi>Saint,</hi> or no? not thy own thoughts, or the applauſe of others can make thee a <hi>Saint,</hi> but thy life regulated by Gods Word. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> cry up their Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> whom they equallize to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in many things; but his Saintſhip muſt be tried, not by his voluntary poverty, or ſtrict obſervance of humane traditions, but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy to Gods Word. Thus who ever is cried up for a Saint, ſtill we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, How doth the Word, and his life agree? Is he as it were a <hi>walking Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> Doth he will what that wils, and nill what that nilleth? And this further alſo may inform us, That we are not to make a man a Saint, becauſe of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular opinion, in ſome way of Church-Government; as if none could be Saints, but of ſuch an opinion. For the word <hi>Saint</hi> denoteth, <hi>One made holy by the Image of God reſtored in him;</hi> though he may differ from another Saint in a Church-way. For although it be our duty to ſtudy out the mind and will of Chriſt concerning Church-order, and with his Inſtitutions only we may expect his gracious preſence, yet ſuch is the corruption and weakneſs upon the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the beſt, that though Gods Spirit will lead them into all neceſſary truth, yet they may fail in ſome acceſſories, and ſo one Saint may differ from another, yea and write againſt another; though ſuch things do prove, as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancihons</hi> difference from him, <hi>Peſſimi exempli,</hi> of <hi>very evil example,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the adverſaries of godlineſs in their dangerous prejudices againſt it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus laid down, let us conſider, Why all the fore-mentioned ſteps of a <hi>Church-Saint</hi> are nothing without the latter. To be a Saint by the outward Covenant, by dedication to God, by outward profeſſion and vocation: Yea, to be a Saint, having ſome works of Gods Spirit on us, unleſs we be born of God, and ſo have holy Natures, holy affections, and an holy converſation; it's to be like the <hi>fooliſh Virgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hereſies in Doctrine have not more moleſted the Church, than prophaneneſs in life. The troubles of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> made in the Church for many years together, was it not becauſe of the prophaneneſs of Chriſtians lives? In our dayes, What is the great argument againſt our <hi>Churches,</hi> that they are <hi>no true Churches,</hi> that they are the <hi>Synagogue of Satan?</hi> Doth not this ariſe wholly from the ungodlineſs of moſt mens lives? Call ſuch Saints; you may as well name <hi>darkneſs, light.</hi> Yea, what is the cauſe that the bringing in of any good Order in a Church, the purging out of the old leaven, is ſuch a grievous tormenting matter? Why do generally people diſlike and rage at it? Is not all this, becauſe though men are contented with the name of a Saint, yet they cannot endure the practical power of it? So that we may ſay, the real un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs of ſuch who are in the Church, is the cauſe of all the evil that comes in

the Church. Thou blameſt this, and that way of Government; thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, Such or ſuch a thing is the cauſe of all our evil: No, it's the love to mens luſt, men would be of the Church, and yet live the life of beaſts and Devils: And it is for this general impiety, that even Heaven and Earth may be aſtoniſhed.

               <p>IT is now full time to conclude this Text. There remain two things more which deſerve ſome conſideration:</p>
               <p>The firſt is occaſioned by <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Queſtion upon the place, <hi>How is it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that he diſtinguiſhed Saints from the Church? Did not theſe Saints imbody themſelves, that lived in the Province of</hi> Achais? <hi>Was it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to live disperſed, and ſingle lives, not entring into Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communnion?</hi> To which he anſwers, <hi>That the times might be then ſo turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and perſecution ſo hot, that they could not gather into a Church, nor have any ſuch publick meetings.</hi> Now this Interpretation is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. For the Apoſtle writing to the Church at <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> yet doth not uſe that name, but ſpeaks in the general, <hi>To the Saints and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Brethren;</hi> when yet without queſtion they were in a Church-ſtate there. Yea in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he makes no mention of them as a Church, but ſtyleth them <hi>Saints;</hi> which puts <hi>Salmeron</hi> upon his gueſſes, Why he doth not give the name of a Church to them? As alſo, Why he doth not ſalute <hi>Peter</hi> their ſuppoſed <hi>Biſhop?</hi> Neither may we think that when <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> inſcribe their Epiſtles, to the <hi>Believers ſcattered in ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> but that they might have occaſionally their publick meetings to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in. Yet though this Expoſition be not neceſſary, we may well <note place="margin">Saints may ſometimes have juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Church, though it be their duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it.</note> receive <hi>Calvins</hi> conjecture as probable. For there have been times when the Saints have been forced to hide themſelves in Dens and Caves, not having opportunity to meet together, though even that was an heavy burden, and trouble to them. This being granted, we may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That although it be a Duty for Saints to joyne themſelves in a Church-way, yet there may ſometimes fall out ſuch juſt reaſons that may excuſe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:48709:58"/>
Indeed voluntarily to keep off from the Aſſemblies, and to think a private worſhipping of God is enough, and that he requireth no more, is both againſt <note place="margin">Reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing it to be each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians duty, to be of a Church.</note> Scripture-command, and the example of primitive Chriſtians, but when there is ſome unavoidable neceſſity, than there is a lawfull excuſe, <hi>That it is a duty for Saints to joyn themſelves in a Church-way,</hi> may be made evident from theſe Grounds briefly:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>From the name Church ordinarily given to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olievers.</hi> Now a <hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>Company</hi> met together; and therefore it is not lawfull for thee to live alone, or be a Miniſter of Sacraments, and all things to thy ſelf. Even as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of him, that would live alone, not joyning himſelf to any humane Society, he muſt be <hi>aut Deus, aut Beſtia;</hi> It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable here, he muſt be made even like God; that needeth no growth of grace; yea, that is above all duty or homage to God; or elſe a very beaſt, one that hath no ſenſe or feeling about a God, and his Worſhip. The <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onymous names alſo to a Church,</hi> doth evidence this; They are called <hi>Chriſts body;</hi> now it's neceſſary for the members of the body to be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, elſe there cannot be that mutual help and furthering of one another. They are alſo called an <hi>Houſe,</hi> and a <hi>ſpiritual Building,</hi> wherein they are to be as <hi>living ſtones;</hi> and ſuch muſt be cloſe, and well compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>From the communion of Saints,</hi> which is a duty ſo often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Scripture; ſuch as to <hi>watch over one another,</hi> to <hi>provoke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to <hi>comfort and rebuke,</hi> if need be. Now how can this be, if Saints be diſperſed from each other?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Officers and Ordinances which Chriſt hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that do neceſſarily inferre Church-Aſſemblies.</hi> For Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are appointed to preach the Word, to be conſtant therein: And how can that be, if there be not publick meetings?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Sacraments likewiſe, do not they ſeal, not only a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, but alſo with one another.</hi> So that it would be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious violation of Chriſts command, for a man to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do juſtly condemn thoſe <hi>Private Maſſes</hi> in Popery, as ridiculous and contrary to the Inſtitution of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The examples of Chriſtians, who upon their converſion are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to joyn themſelves to the Church, and they continued together pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and breaking of bread.</hi> Yea, in the Old Teſtament, we ſee ſtill, there was a conſtant, publick meeting to worſhip God: and <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth his joy in thoſe ſolemn meetings, as alſo his reſolutions, <hi>To praiſe God in the great Congregation.</hi> And certainly, as by theſe ſolemn meetings God is more honoured; therefore the glorified Saints in Heaven are ſaid to be a Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. ſo God hath promiſed to ſuch meetings an higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his preſence, <hi>He delights to be in the Aſſembly of his Saints.</hi> So that theſe publick meetings are for our ſpiritual good, as well as Gods glory.</p>
               <p>Though this be ſo, yet there may be ſome Cauſe that may juſtly excuſe <note place="margin">What are the cauſes that may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us from joyning our ſelves to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings.</note> us. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Publick and violent perſecutions, as have been many times in Gods Church,</hi> then they have not been ſuffered to have either publick or private meetings. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. The Apoſtle mentioneth ſuch times, when he ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>Of whom the world was not worthy of,</hi> yet were not allowed a place in the world, but were as ſo many beaſts chaſed up and down, living in dens and holes of Rocks. Thus it was alſo once with <hi>David,</hi> when baniſhed out of <hi>Judea,</hi> though this was a ſad affliction, and he doth in ſeveral <hi>Pſalms</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48709:59"/>
bewail his exile from the Ordinances, more than any temporal mercy what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; neither his countrey or outward accommodations do ſit ſo upon his heart, as that I cannot enjoy God in his Ordinances, as I have done. So then, though they were not actually in any Church-communion, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their deſire and wiſh, they were to be as accounted of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It may ſo fall out, that there be ſuch a malice and poiſon in the hearts of thoſe that do govern and rule in the Church, that they will excommunicate and caſt out thoſe that are true believers from the Church, and will not let them have any Church-ſociety.</hi> Now in ſuch caſes, if the godly cannot obtain any publick Church-priviledge, which yet they deſire, this will lie on thoſe that caſt them out, <hi>Luke 6. 22. John</hi> 16. 2. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tels the Diſciples it ſhall be their portion, <hi>They ſhall be caſt out of the Synagogues,</hi> ſeparated from company, even as they did a blind man healed, confeſſing Chriſt, whom yet Chriſt met and encouraged. This then is no new thing. Yea <hi>Bernard</hi> complained in his time, <hi>Heu Domine qui ſunt in Eccleſiâ primi, ſunt in perſecutione primi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If there be ſuch a general and univerſal pollution, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian at leaſt for the preſent knoweth not what Church to joyn to, where he can have communion without partaking of groſs Idolatry.</hi> It's a Rule avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Canon-Law, <hi>Cauſa, non ſeparatio facit, Shiſma.</hi> Thoſe that would not bow their knee to <hi>Baal</hi> in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time, were not <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> for there was a juſt cauſe to refuſe ſuch Idolatry; if then it be truly with a man, as it was in ſuppoſition with <hi>Elijah,</hi> that he is left alone, Idolatry hath filled the whole Church viſibly; in ſuch a caſe, though that be hardly to be ſeen, he is to abſtain from Church-ſocieties, till God make way for it. For then it is, as if a Chriſtian, ſhould by ſome accident be caſt upon a Countrey of Infidels and Pagans, as ſome Chriſtians have been, there cannot be had any Church-ſociety at all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Church of God in the primitive times, when many Heathens, and Infidels were converted, had this cuſtome, which I find commended by moſt; and that was, before the Church would receive ſuch converted Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens into an actual Communion with the Church, they took time to inſtruct them, and to try whether they were fit for that Sacrament, or no; and when they were prepared, then they received them.</hi> Theſe were called <hi>Catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noi</hi> and <hi>Competentes.</hi> They were truly members of the Church, as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> maintain againſt <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> only they had not as yet the actual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into it. This cuſtom in Antiquity of admitting none to <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> but ſuch as were inſtructed, doth hold by proportion for the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> likewiſe. Seeing now that all are baptized in their Infancy; and whether Parents have done their duties, or that they have ſufficient knowledge to come to a Sacrament, may juſtly be queſtioned, when we ſee ſo much groſs ignorance in the Chriſtian Religion abounding every where. Therefore in Antiquity there was Eccleſiaſtical Confirmation, which was to make ſearch and trial about the knowledge and ſufficiency of ſuch, who had been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and if found duly qualified, then they were confirmed. Such care did they uſe in Antiquity about thoſe that were admitted to Church-ſociety, inſomuch that <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> a man of famous learning, ſaith, It had been well in the Church of God, if men had laid aſide many unneceſſary diſputes, and endeavoured to bring in that holy and godly order, the primitive Church had, eſpecially about the Lords Supper. And <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaking of this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Confirmation, before it was ſo horribly depraved by after ages, and made a Sacrament, wiſheth it were brought into the Church of God again, as that which would make parents more diligent, who now think the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their children doth not belong to them; neither would there
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48709:59"/>
be ſuch ignorance and rudeneſs in people, as now thereis. <hi>Inſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In theſe caſes a Saint without Church-communion may be excuſed. But then there are ſinfull and unjuſtifiable grounds of ſome perſons, who do not <note place="margin">2. Unlawfull grounds upon which ſome do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>Firſt, <hi>From a Corrupt Opinion:</hi> As, 1. Of thoſe who call themſelves <hi>Seekers,</hi> confeſſing they cannot yet find a <hi>Church,</hi> to which they may joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> For they affirm, <hi>That ſince the Apoſtles dayes there are no Churches, and therefore till they can ſee Apoſtles, Apoſtolical gifts and miracles, with the like effuſion of the holy Ghoſt upon perſons, they cannot own any Church.</hi> But this is againſt thoſe Texts of Scripture, which ſpeak of a perpetuity of the Miniſtry, and the duty of receiving Sacraments, till the coming of Chriſt, which could not be, if there were no Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another corrupt opinion is, of thoſe who call themſelves <hi>high Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Theſe make themſelves above the Church-ordinances, they need them not; yea ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> made themſelves above the Bible, living wholly upon ſpiritual revelations, and called thoſe, who would leave to the Scripture as a Rule, <hi>Creaturiſtae,</hi> as depending upon a creature. But the Scripture and Ordinances are neceſſary to quicken grace in the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and there are none ſo ſpiritual, but they need them daily to comfort or inſtruct them; yet ſuch have their publick Aſſemblies, wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their opinions to be received. But if people ought to be above all Miniſtry and teaching, then alſo above theirs. And certainly, if thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>being taught of God,</hi> and <hi>having an unction which teacheth us all things,</hi> be againſt our Miniſtry, it is alſo againſt theirs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There may be a corrupt opinion, which though it be not againſt Church-communion abſolutely, yet they judge it <hi>Arbitrary, and not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi> Of this opinion <hi>Grotius</hi> ſeemed once to be; for he is thought to be the Author of that Book, which aſſerts, <hi>Quod non ſemper communicandum per ſymbola;</hi> and <hi>Rivet</hi> in his <hi>Dialyſis</hi> againſt him, chargeth this upon him, that he was not a member of any Church, acknowledging it a juſt hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that at his death, when a Miniſter was brought to him, he was wholly ſenſleſs: So that he who in his life time cared not for Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, could not have any benefit by a Miniſter of the Goſpel at his death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt corrupt opinion, by which men may not joyn to a Church, may be from a <hi>ſuperſtitious conceit, whereby men thinking it impoſſible to have ſalvation in the world, have impriſoned themſelves, as it were, in Cells, and holes of Rocks, thereby to give themſelves wholly to divine Contemplation.</hi> Thus the <hi>Monks, Eremites</hi> and <hi>Anchorites</hi> of old. For though ſome of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient are excuſed, as being driven thereunto by perſecution, yet the latter ſeemed to be tranſported wholly with ſuperſtition; and therefore in that they lived ſolely, not coming to the publick Ordinances of God in a Church way, it was not juſtifiable by Scripture. Indeed if they took their times, to come to publick Societies, and receive Sacraments, as <hi>Rivet</hi> affirmeth againſt <hi>Grotius, Dialyſ. pag.</hi> 106. pleading their example for being of no Church, then they are to be excuſed <hi>à tanto,</hi> though not <hi>à toto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond unlawfull ground of keeping from Communion with Church-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, is, <hi>A prophane Atheiſtical dispoſition,</hi> that look upon a Church, and <note place="margin">2. From cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> a Church-aſſembly, as humane devices, to keep men in awe; or if they be not ſo eminently <hi>Atheiſtical,</hi> yet their love to their luſts and pleaſures, to the world and contents thereof, make them weary of the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48709:60"/>
as thoſe in <hi>Amos 8. 5. When will the Sabbath be over, that we may ſet forth wheat to ſell?</hi> How many are there that comes as ſeldome as ever they can to theſe publick Aſſemblies, and when they do come, it's but for cuſtom and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, not that they ever found any ſpiritual good, or expect and deſire any?</p>
               <p>Therefore let the <hi>Uſe</hi> be of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> that as ye are not to reſt in any Church <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Of Inſtruction</note> forms, or external Communion, to think that the very bodily doing of them will ſave you. So on the other ſide, Take heed of voluntarily, and wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the publick Aſſemblies. How have the godly, when baniſhed and driven from them, bewailed their miſery, whereas thou doſt voluntarily abſent thy ſelf? Think how it may lie upon thee at thy death, when thou ſhalt remember the many Sabbaths, the many Ordinances thou haſt neglected; and now if God would give thee but one day, or one hour to make thy peace with him, thou wouldſt judge it a great mercy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Obſervation is from the <hi>Univerſality, All the Saints.</hi> There are none ſo mean, ſo inconſiderable, but this Epiſtle is directed to them, as well as the moſt eminent. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſoul of the pooreſt and meaneſt Saint, is not to be neglected.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſoul of the pooreſt Saint is as much to be regarded, as of the greateſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That as the rain falleth upon the leaſt ſpire of graſs, as well as the choiſeſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; ſo ought all miniſterial planting and watering to be to the meaneſt plant in Chriſts garden, as well as the chiefeſt. Though Chriſtian Religion doth not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh civil Polity, nor the diſtinctions and relations of Magiſtrate and Subject, of Maſter and Servant, but ſtrictly enjoyneth their reſpective duties; yet in reſpect of religious conſiderations, all are but as one. Thus the Apoſtle notably, <hi>Gal. 3. 28. There is neither bond or free, male or female, but all are one</hi> (mark that) <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt looketh upon all as one man. And certainly, if Chriſt in ſhedding his bloud for his people, had an equal reſpect to the meaneſt with the greateſt, he died for the godly ſervant, as well as the godly maſter; the godly poor man, as well as the godly rich man; Then it behoveth all Chriſtians to imitate him in this. Whoſoever is a Saint, though he be never ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, do thou own and imbrace ſuch; elſe we do not love the brotherhood, we do not love a godly man, becauſe he is godly, but becauſe he is great or rich, or may advantage thee in the world. <hi>Paul</hi> will not except, or leave out one of the Saints in all <hi>Acbaia.</hi>

               <p>HItherto we have conſidered the <hi>Inſcription;</hi> we now come to the <hi>Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is in theſe words, and it containeth matter of prayer. It is not any earthly or temporal mercy he prayeth for, but what is heavenly and ſpiritual. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth conſtantly uſe this Salutation; only in both thoſe Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> which were Church-officers, he interpoſeth <hi>Mercy</hi> between <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace. Calvin</hi> thinketh he putteth it in his Salutation to <hi>Timothy,</hi> becauſe of his dear affection and love to him; but why ſhould he do it to <hi>Titus</hi> alſo? Certainly it ought to be conſidered, that only to Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers he uſeth this Salutation. Some think, becauſe the work of the Miniſtry meets with much malice and froward oppoſition from wicked men, which made <hi>Paul</hi> pray, that God would deliver him from unreaſonable, abſurd men, who are led only by humours and paſſions, not by Reaſon and Religion. Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that do faithfully diſcharge their truſt, meet with little favour and love from men; hence it is that he doth in a peculiar manner pray for <hi>mercy</hi> to them. Others they think the word is inſerted, becauſe of the great difficulty of the Miniſtry, it being a burden too heavy even for <hi>Angels</hi> ſhoulders: Inſomuch that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thought, <hi>Few Church-officers could be ſaved.</hi> Seeing then the work is ſo great, ſo much grace is required to manage it, and the beſt have failings, therefore they need the mercy prayed for. But this by the way.</p>

And indeed the <hi>Heathens</hi> knew no better; but the Apoſtle would lift up our hearts to higher things. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> Chap. 1. 1. writing to the <hi>disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Tribes,</hi> uſeth the word only, <hi>Greeting;</hi> which made <hi>Cajetan,</hi> among other reaſons reject it, as <hi>not Canonical,</hi> as if ſuch a Salutation ſavoured of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit: But this is no Argument.

               <p>The Grace of God, and Goſpel peace is infinitely to be preferred before any outward advantage. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. when <hi>David</hi> had repreſented the natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of every man unregenerated, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> He preſently demonſtrates the clean contrary diſpoſition of thoſe that are godly and ſpiritual, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us;</hi> and, <hi>Thou haſt put more gladneſs into my heart, then they have had, when their wine or oyl in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.</hi> By <hi>David</hi> you may judge of all the faithfull; they eſteem more of the love of God, and the ſenſe or perſwaſion of this, more than the whole world. Let the prophane bruitiſh men of the world ſay, as ſome did in <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes</hi> time, whom he reproveth, <hi>Give me that which is ſweet, although it choke me.</hi> So let me have my pleaſures, my luſts, though they damn me. The godly on the other ſide, if raiſed up to this heavenly transfiguration, as it were, to have <hi>the ſpirit of Adoption, enabling them to call God Father, and to walk under the light of his grace and favour,</hi> they will ſay, <hi>It is good to be here.</hi> So that the deſires and earneſt longings of mens hearts do divide the world into two parts; Some, and they are only few, who with <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo do their ſouls after God.</hi> Yea, <hi>Their ſouls break for the longing they have to God at all times.</hi> But then others, they ſeek the things of this world in the firſt place; Let them have their pleaſures, their wealth, their honours, then with the <hi>Reubenites</hi> they will ſit down, and go no further, becauſe they ſee the Land is a good and pleaſant Land, never deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to go into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To open this Doctrine, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That all the while a man is meerly natural and dead in his ſins, he is not affected with, nor can he deſire any ſpiritual mercy.</hi> Even as dead men are not affected with pleaſant ſights, or melodious ſounds. No wonder then, though we do out of the Goſpel ſhew ſuch all the glory of Heaven, yet they will not fall down and worſhip Chriſt, becauſe they are no wayes ſenſible or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of a better good. Can a <hi>Worm</hi> that crawleth upon the ground live the life of an <hi>Angel,</hi> or a <hi>man?</hi> Alas, that knoweth nothing, but to crawl on the ground, and feed on the duſt of the earth. Thus it is with every carnal man, ſpeak to him of the ſavour of God, of the light of his countenance, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no more what you mean, than the bruit beaſt doth what reaſon is. Beſides, ſinne hath ſo infected and polluted the heart and appetite of every natural man, that he calleth <hi>good, evil;</hi> and <hi>evil, good;</hi> he takes <hi>ſweet</hi> for <hi>bitter,</hi> and <hi>bitter</hi> for <hi>ſweet.</hi> That as the Swine loveth to wallow in its mire, and delighteth in that, more than in the ſweeteſt garden that is: Or, as they ſay of thoſe blind Beetles that live in muck and dung, but ſweet things do preſently kill them; thus it is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48709:61"/>
with every natural man, he is not only not affected, but he is contrarily diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to heavenly things, <hi>Rom. 8. The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmity againſt God.</hi> The <hi>wiſdome,</hi> the beſt underſtanding, parts and knowledge that he hath, is as full of malice againſt holy things, as a Toad of poiſon. The Greek word doth not only ſignifie his intellectual, but his practical wiſdom and affection; he doth not ſay, He hath ſavoury knowledge of heavenly things <hi>(Sapientia eſt ſapida ſcientia;)</hi> And as <hi>Bernard, Sapiens eſt cui res ſapiunt, prout ſunt.</hi> Heavenly things ſavour as heavenly; earthly things as earthly.) But in every natural man his appetite and taſte is wholly diſordered, he finds no excellency, lovelineſs in heavenly things, which yet to a gracious heart are matter of exceeding delight and raviſhment.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>Till a man be regenerated, till he be made a new creature, and endowed with an heavenly heart, he is no ſutable ſubject for theſe heavenly things.</hi> Every one then as he is affected and diſpoſed, ſo he judgeth; if earthly, then all his affections move that way; if heavenly, then they are turned the contrary way. As you ſee in mixed and compounded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, what element doth moſt predominate, accordingly is their motion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upward or downward; now in this regenerate perſon, his nature is now changed, and he hath a ſpiritual reſurrection, that as the body, when that ſhall riſe, will loſe its gravity and burdenſomneſs; for we ſhall meet the Lord in the Air, even with our bodies. So the ſoul in this life made partaker of a ſpiritual reſurrection, hath caſt off thoſe burdens and clogs, that did preſs it down to the creature, and aſcends up to communion with God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And beſides this general Cauſe, there are ſome peculiar qualifications, which <note place="margin">What are thoſe things that peculiarly move the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preferre ſpirituals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore temporals</note> provoke the godly man to eſteem the Grace and Peace of God above all things As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſenſe of the ſting of ſin, and the bitter guilt thereof, is that which makes a man go out of himſelf and all creatures, to have ſome ſupply and comfort.</hi> Alas, the ſoul thus broken and contrite for ſinne, is like that diſeaſed woman, that had ſpent all ſhe had upon Phyſicians, and yet ſhe was as bad as ever, till Chriſt cured her. So that the grace of God, and Goſpel peace is the only oil, that can be poured into this wound. Come to a <hi>David,</hi> who complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>God had hid his face,</hi> yea <hi>his bones were broken,</hi> and all his deſirable things periſh; and tell him, while thus affected, That he had a glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, many outward mercies and delights he might rejoyce in; What good would this muſick do to his ſad heart? Oh it's ſomething elſe that muſt cure him! No creature, no wealth can do it, but peace from God; and this made him, while in thoſe conflicts, but getting ſome victory, breathe out ſo affectionately, <hi>Pſal. 32. 1. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no ſinne;</hi> not bleſſed is he who hath the good things and pleaſures of the world, who liveth at his hearts eaſe, but whoſe ſinne is pardoned. Thus the guilt of ſinne maketh him eſteem Grace and Peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe ſpiritual deſertions and temptations, which ſometimes the deareſt of Gods children feel, do make them eſteem of the favour of God, the poſſeſſion of that more than any thing.</hi> They ſit as <hi>Rachel, refuſing to be comforted,</hi> till they have obtained this. How precious was the preſence of Chriſt to the Church? When ſhe had loſt him, then ſhe will hold him, and not let him go; as the night, or the eclipſe maketh the Sunne more precious. Where there is nothing but ſenſe of unworthineſs, what is more welcome than grace? Where there is a deſert of hell and damnation, where the ſoul hath cauſe to expect nothing but the frowns and vengeance of God, there to meet with grace and favour: Oh how welcome is this! Thus the heart which hath continual fears, tumult and warre within it ſelf, to have peace, and that with God; ſuch a peace as no outward miſery can take away; What unſpeakable refreſhments are theſe? It is theſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48709:62"/>
dark and cloudy thoughts, that make the leaſt beams of Gods face ſhining upon them more than all the enjoyments of this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The experimental taſte and ſweetneſs, which they have of heavenly things, maketh them undervalue all things elſe.</hi> If the Prodigal after he had eaten of the ſatted Calf, and been refreſhed in his fathers houſe, had returned again to his husks, how unſufferable had it been? This aggravated the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ingratitude, that after they had eaten <hi>Manna,</hi> they ſhould deſire the <hi>garlick of Egypt.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2, 3. exhorting them, <hi>to deſire the ſincere milk of the Word,</hi> to be as much affected with it, and delight in, as children with their milk, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>If ſo be ye have taſted how good God is;</hi> implying, that this taſting, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental trial of the goodneſs and grace of God in Chriſt, is that which will make them ſtill long for more and more of God. It's no wonder, that natural men are never affected with theſe Goſpel-promiſes, they never knew better, they were never acquainted with better, and therefore they cannot deſire it; but thou haſt known how good God is, thou haſt had the firſt-fruits of Heaven and glory upon thy ſoul, and therefore thou doſt ſtill importune for more, and deſire more of Gods preſence, never ſaying, <hi>It is enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us conſider the Reaſons, why the gracious heart doth <note place="margin">The Reaſons of it.</note> thus deſire heavenly things above all outward advantages whatſoever. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe theſe ſpiritual objects have only univerſal ſufficiency and fulneſs in them, to ſatisfie and content the heart.</hi> If God be reconciled, if he be our God, what then can be wanting to our happineſs? Thus <hi>David</hi> acknowledged, when he ſaid, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and none in earth in compariſon of thee?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi>

                  </gap>3. how contented and happy is he, in <hi>having God his God?</hi> The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are but as a drop, they have only a limited goodneſs, but God is the ocean, there is nothing wanting. Hence it is, that becauſe the glorified Saints have a beatifical viſion of God, therefore they cannot ſin, they cannot immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately deſire any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe ſpiritual mercies they are everlaſting and eternal.</hi> If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had wiſhed honours, wealth, long life to them, yet all theſe would have been but for a moment comparatively, they could not have continued with them alwayes; whereas the favour of God, and the effects thereof, they are to all eternity: whom God taketh into his favour, he never caſteth out. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men have been in grace and favour with the Potentates of the world, yet at laſt caſt off, and ended their dayes tragically? <hi>Haman</hi> may be a conſtant inſtance of the inconſtant grace and favour of men; but whom God receiveth into this favour, he will never abhorre again: Such gifts as theſe, are without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Oh then preſs hard for this, uſe an holy violence for this! This will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave thee, till it hath made thee eternally happy. The Manna that was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered for any day of the week, would laſt but that night, but that which was treaſured up for the Sabbath-day, would continue longer. Thus the things laid up for this life, they will quickly vaniſh, but what is in reference to Heaven, and our Sabbath or reſt there, that will continue alwayes.</p>

               <p>THe next thing conſiderable in theſe words, are the <hi>particular mercies</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for in this Salutation. The firſt whereof, and that which is the efficient cauſe of all other things, is <hi>Grace.</hi> The Common-place in Divinity, <hi>De Gratia Dei,</hi> of the grace of God, is of a very vaſt extent, and moſt of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, Arminian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> errours, ariſe from the miſtake of the uſe of this word in the Scripture; but it would be impertinent to graſp that whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie. I ſhall not treat any more of it, then what may relate to this Text.</p>
               <p>We may therefore briefly take notice of the uſe of it to our purpoſe, That the firſt and moſt principal ſignification of it, is <hi>the favour and mercy of God towards us;</hi> for it anſwereth the Hebrew word <hi>Chen,</hi> which comes of a root that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>to have mercy.</hi> So that when the Scripture faith, <hi>We are juſtified by grace, we are called by grace, we are ſaved by grace.</hi> The Popiſh party doth groſly erre, taking grace there for ſomething in us wrought by the Spirit of God, whereas it is indeed without us, even the Attribute of mercy and grace in God. So that the meaning is, We obtain ſuch glorious priviledges, not becauſe of any thing in our ſelves, though never ſo holy, but becauſe of the meer <hi>grace</hi> and favour of God without us. <hi>Grace</hi> then in the moſt frequent and principal ſignification of it, denoteth the favour and goodneſs of God. But then</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, It is uſed ſometimes for the <hi>Effects of this Grace.</hi> For as <hi>mercy</hi> is ſometimes taken for the attribute in God, and ſometimes for the effects of it: So likewiſe is <hi>grace.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Gods grace,</hi> is ſometimes put for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the preaching of the Word. This being meerly from his grace, that he vouchſafeth ſuch a mercy to his people, <hi>Act. 20. 24. Tit.</hi> 2. 11. Sometimes it is taken for the good ſucceſs and ſpecial aſſiſtance that God giveth unto the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of it, <hi>Act. 14. 26. 1 Cor. 15. 10. Yet not I, but the grace of God,</hi> viz. aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and giving ſucceſs to my miniſterial labours.</p>
               <p>Again, It's applied to thoſe common gifts of Gods Spirit, which were ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully vouchſafed in thoſe dayes, <hi>To ſpeak with tongues, to work miracles,</hi> theſe are called <hi>the grace of God;</hi> though ſome would diſtinguiſh between <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 10. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 10. Yea the very function and offices in the Church are called Gods <hi>Grace;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did his Apoſtleſhip, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. becauſe it's the meer <hi>grace of God,</hi> that hath appointed ſuch Offices in the Church.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church makes the more ordinary ſence, that indeed is ſometimes, but ſeldom to be found in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignifie thoſe <hi>habits and principles of holineſs, which are with in us.</hi> There are ſome indeed,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48709:63"/>
who ſay, The Scripture never uſeth the word <hi>Grace</hi> in this ſenſe, but ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeem to be clear, <hi>Col. 3. 16. Col. 4. 6. Heb. 13. 9. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may truly call that work of God in us <hi>Grace,</hi> ſo that we do not make it to juſtifie or ſave, for that is the grace of God without us. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the grace of God is to be deſired by every one, in the chiefeſt and firſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The grace of God is to be deſired before all other things.</note> 
                  <hi>place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This we ſhould earneſtly pray for, that whatſoever God would deny us, yet that he would give us his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi> We are (I ſay) to deſire it, not only above all temporal and earthly comforts above riches, honours and long life, but even above the ſanctification and holineſs of our ſouls, which God worketh. We are to deſire his grace, more than grace in our own hearts; for this is the effect of that, and this alone being imperfect in us, could not juſtifie or ſave us. Let us diſcover this rich treaſure of Gods grace, though the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. calls it, <hi>The exceeding riches of his grace;</hi> ſo that we can never ſpeak to the full of it, though we had the tongue of men and Angels, ſtill there is more in the grace of God, than we are able to fathom. We muſt therefore ſpeak and underſtand as children about it, till in Heaven this imperfection be done away. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We muſt know, that God hath ſeveral attributes tending to the ſame thing,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Propoſitions diſcovering the nature of the grace of God.</note> 
                  <hi>yet do not ionally differ.</hi> There is his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> whereby he is willing to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of his fulneſs to the creature. Thus he was good to <hi>Adam,</hi> making him ſo glorious a creature. There is his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and that is, whereby he pitieth his creature, being caſt into miſery. There is alſo his <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> which is extended to ſinners that do for a long time rebell againſt him, when he could, if he pleaſed, deſtroy them every moment in hell. And laſtly, here is this property of <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby he is called a <hi>gracious God:</hi> And this the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth ſpeak of, as the moſt glorious and comfortable attribute; and that doth imply theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That whatſoever good God doth beſtow upon us, it cometh ſolely and originally</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What the grace of God implies.</note> 
                  <hi>from his meer bounty and good pleaſure.</hi> So that there is nothing in us, that may in the leaſt manner, either merit with God, or move him to be thus gracious. So that we can never hear of this word <hi>[Grace]</hi> but it ſhould preſently humble and debaſe us, it ſhould make us condemn our ſelves, and give all to God. For if it be of <hi>grace,</hi> than there was no motive in us, God out of his own bowels doth this for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5, 6. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh very fully to this, <hi>If of grace, than it is not of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace.</hi> So that to acknowledge the grace of God, as <hi>Pelagians</hi> were forced to do, and ſo <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> do, yet at laſt to divide between <hi>grace</hi> and our <hi>ſelves,</hi> to make us <hi>co-workers</hi> with it, yea to make it effectual; this is to take all away really, that we had given verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before. So that if it be Gods grace, we muſt not give ſo much as the leaſt ſigh and deſire to our ſelves; all cometh meerly from the good pleaſure of his own will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace doth not only thus imply a pure and only original from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, excluding us, but it ſuppoſeth alſo <hi>a manifeſt unworthineſs in us, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſert to what God beſtoweth upon us.</hi> Therefore <hi>grace</hi> in the Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſuppoſeth <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> in us, that we deſerve to be abhorred, and caſt out of Gods preſence. Hence juſtification and pardon of ſinne are attributed to the grace of God, becauſe we by our ſins might juſtly have expected Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and his condemnation. So that the word <hi>Grace</hi> is ſtill to debaſe us more and more in our own eyes. For it doth not only proclaim, that all cometh meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, but alſo that we are wretched ſinners, who have deſerved the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and frowns of God, when now we have the light of his countenance. To
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48709:63"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> God was very bountifull, and full of love; yet ſome Divines ſay, That we cannot call that <hi>Gods grace</hi> to him, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was not in a ſinfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary eſtate, deſerving the wrath of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This grace of God is more especially demonſtrated in thoſe effects which relate to the happineſs and bleſſedneſs of the ſoul.</hi> Therefore it's the grace of God in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and juſtifying us, in ſending his Sonne to redeem us, in vouchſafing Goſpel-mercies to us. In this the grace of God is made moſt apparent; and this ſhould teach us, what we ſhould prize moſt, what we ſhould be affected moſt with, even theſe ſpiritual mercies. The Scripture doth ſeldom or never call it, the grace of God, to give us wealth, health and temporal mercies; theſe are not worthy to be mentioned, when we ſpeak of Juſtification, Remiſſion and Salvation; and yet how carnal and corrupt are we? We deſire the grace or favour of God, for our bodies, for outward happineſs; but who is ſenſible of the need of Gods grace in this ſpiritual manner? Thou canſt not therefore argue Gods grace is to thee, becauſe thou liveſt in proſperity. and haſt what thy ſoul can deſire. For theſe may ſtand with Gods anger and wrath, thou mayeſt be a fire-brand of hell, and one prepared for deſtruction for all this. Oh then be ſenſible of that which the Scripture attributeth to Gods grace, but none ſave an holy, heavenly heart can do this!</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This grace is communicated to us in and through Chriſt.</hi> So that it is called in Scripture, <hi>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in a two-fold reſpect, 1. <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How grace is called the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</note> becauſe he is able to beſtow it upon us. You ſee in the Text <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth it from him, as well as God the Father. And, 2. <hi>Meritoriouſly,</hi> becauſe Chriſt by his bloud hath made a way open and free for grace to manifeſt it ſelf. Oh then, let us know, that without Chriſt, God is a conſuming fire, a condemning Judge; that there was no more poſſibility without him, to have ſo much as a drop of grace, as there was for <hi>Dives</hi> in hell, to obtain a drop of water! No, no, there was too great a gulph between God and us. Indeed the <hi>Socinians</hi> they <hi>blaspheme</hi> and ſay, <hi>If we hold the merits and ſatisfaction of Chriſt</hi> (they ſay) <hi>this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the grace of God, making it none at all. What grace is it</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for God to forgive and pardon, when he receiveth full ſatisfaction for it?</hi> But though it be of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to Chriſt, yet it is meer and only <hi>Grace</hi> in reſpect of us, and that many wayes, but eſpecially in theſe two particulars; 1. <hi>That God was not bound to take a Surety for us;</hi> he might have ſtood for ſatisfaction in our own perſons; that we who had ſinned ſhould alſo be puniſhed. And then, 2. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this price be paid, yet the application of it, is wholly of grace.</hi> For how many are damned? How many have no ſinne forgiven, or pardoned to them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt came as a Saviour into the world. It is therefore meer, and only <hi>grace</hi> to make thee partaker of this <hi>grace,</hi> which cometh by Chriſt. God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but Chriſt made way for it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Gods grace therefore is the ſame, with that which the Scripture calls the light of his countenance;</hi> Which is an alluſion to men, who when they were pleaſed, and delight in any, they look in a ſmiling and chearfull manner upon ſuch. Thus it is with God, when he is reconciled through Chriſt with thoſe that are his, he doth preſently caſt away his anger, doth no longer turn his face from them, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring and loathing their perſons and duties; but he accepts of them, looketh upon them with delight: Inſomuch that the Scripture makes this to be the utmoſt bleſſedneſs, that a godly man can deſire to have, <hi>The light of Gods countenance ſhining upon him,</hi> to be under his <hi>gracious favour,</hi> as you ſee by <hi>Davids</hi> earneſt petition for it, and the ſad troubles and diſtreſſes, which were upon his ſoul when he hid his face from him. So that to partake of Gods grace comprehends all the comfort, glory and bleſſedneſs we can deſire.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This property of God, of being <hi>gracious,</hi> though it hath alwayes been to the Church ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, yet it hath broken out by degrees: Inſomuch that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48709:64"/>
the Goſpel time is the time of grace in a more eminent manner. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> theſe were all juſtified by <hi>grace,</hi> as well as we, though in Chriſts time this glorious light break out into its full luſtre. God telleth <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Exod. 22. 27. <hi>He would hear the cry of the oppreſſed, for he was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> often, <hi>Pſal. 86. 15. Pſal.</hi> 111. 4. doth acknowledge this comfortable property in God, that <hi>he is gracious.</hi> So that in the old admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, though every thing was more covered and obſcure, yet then it was the <hi>grace of God alone,</hi> that they made their refuge; yet this was ſo dark com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, that the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>John 1. 17. The Law came by Moſes, but grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> as if thoſe former diſpenſations were not diſpenſations of grace. Hence the expreſſion is, <hi>Tit. 2. 11. The grace of God hath appeared,</hi> viz. in a moſt viſible, irradiant manner, that our eyes are dazelled with it, as when the Sunne ſhineth in its full ſtrength at noon-day. So that all thoſe Doctrines, which in theſe Goſpel times do obſcure the grace of God, are more intollerable, than thoſe who pleaded the Law, and the works of the Law in former times.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let us conſider, <hi>What are the oppoſites to this grace of God;</hi> or, <hi>What are thoſe ſinnes that do keep off this grace of God from us.</hi> For though this Sunne ſhine never ſo gloriouſly; though this Ocean be never ſo full, yet if we ſhut our eyes, or wilfully ſtop the ſtreams of this fountain, we ſhall not receive any good by it. And there are theſe remarkable ſins, like ſo many opacous bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that do interclude this grace from us. I ſhall not meddle with Doctrinal opinions, but practical indiſpoſitions. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He who ſeeketh to be juſtified by the works of the Law, by his external obedience thereunto, he will never come under the ſweet benefit of Gods grace.</hi> A man that is fully confident in his own righteouſneſs, and the good of his own heart, will alwayes be neglective of the grace of God. You may ſee this largely by thoſe arguments the Apoſtle hath in his Epiſties. A <hi>phariſaical spirit</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an adverſary to <hi>Free-grace;</hi> but oh the proneneſs in all to this ſinne, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially men civillized, and meerly moralized, that are kept from the groſs pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world! You may as ſoon remove the earth, as ſuch, from their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed righteouſneſs. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh it as the general ſinne of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 10. 2. <hi>That being ignorant of the righteouſneſs of God, they went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe.</hi> They would fain ſet up this <hi>Dagon.</hi> This is the ſweet poiſon, that is the death of ſo many; <hi>Intus exiſtens prohibet alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> And when the ſenſible object is put upon the ſenſitive faculty, it cannot perceive. And hence it is that there are very few, that do indeed admire and ſet up this <hi>grace of God.</hi> If the Prodigal had fared as deliciouſly every day, as <hi>Dives,</hi> he would never have deſired his Fathers houſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another indiſpoſing thing, to eſteem of the grace of God, is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of this, <hi>When men are not ſenſible of original corruption, in the efficacy of it, when they do not ſee or feel how miſerable they are.</hi> Theſe two go al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes together; he that maketh nothing of original ſinne, hath alſo as low and ſlighty thoughts of grace. You ſee it in <hi>Paul,</hi> while ignorant of this, what high and great thoughts he had of himſelf; but when once he came to be <hi>anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized,</hi> when once the dark corners of his ſoul were made known, then who did more long for, and breathe after the grace of God than he?</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third indiſpoſition, which is a natural conſequent of the former, <hi>Where there is not poverty of spirit, brokenneſſe of heart, and thereby an hungring and thirſting after the grace of God.</hi> With ſuch alſo this hath no precious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, <hi>Matth. 11. 28. Come unto me ye that are heavy loaden, and I will eaſe you. Ho, every one that thirſteth, Come,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. But alas, where are theſe tender, contrite, and hungring Chriſtians? No marvel that you ſee ſo few crying out, Oh, if we could have the light of Gods countenance, if we
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48709:64"/>
could but feel the grace of God ſhining upon us, we would not matter any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition whatſoever! Such flowers as theſe grow but in few places. Chriſt and his grace are not importunately deſired and wreſtled for in prayer, becauſe ſo few are of a contrite hear.</p>

                  <hi>mercy</hi> that we can deſire, either for our ſelves, or others. We have been informed, who are thoſe <hi>capable and fit Subjects,</hi> that may partake of this grace of God. There remain ſome more <hi>Qualifications</hi> to be inſiſted upon. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such only partake of Gods grace without, who have true inward ſanctifying grace.</hi> For although it be true, that the grace of God without us, is to be preferred and eſteemed above all inherent grace, yet theſe are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjoyned together. None can claim Gods grace, and plead the mercifull effects thereof, but ſuch who have this teſtimony, and evidence within. It is true, this grace (as is to be ſhewed) maketh way for it ſelf; and begins the firſt ſtone in this ſpiritual foundation: but then the ſubſequent effects of this grace, are only to thoſe, who have the inward work of it upon their own ſouls. And this muſt be diligently obſerved, that ſo wicked and ungodly men may not think to taſte of this tree of life: What haſt thou to do, to ſpeak of Gods grace, to hope in Gods grace, who haſt no grace in thy heart? Think not, that God will extend it to ſuch as thou art; for then it would be ſuch grace, as would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to ſinne, and imbolden in evil wayes. Then we might truly take up that reſolution, which the Apoſtle with ſo much indignation rejecteth, <hi>Let us ſinne that grace may abound.</hi> No, the whole word of God ſpeaketh <hi>no grace, no peace to a wicked man.</hi> It's not the grace of God, but the anger, the fury, and the wrath of God to ſuch perſons. Hence <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. even at that very time, when God is pronounced gracious and long-ſuffering, it is added, <hi>Who will in no wiſe acquit the guilty;</hi> yet who can keep off theſe ſwine from running into this ſweet garden? Let them live graceleſs perſons, yet for all this, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume God will be gracious to them. But be not deceived, Gods word is not a lie; thou wilt find the iſſue to be, as that ſpeaketh. And although thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48709:65"/>
for the preſent have much outward proſperity, many temporal advantages, yet the curſe and anger of God may be upon thee all the day long for all this. <hi>Dives</hi> had great ſtore of earthly benefits, but needed as much a crum of Gods grace, as it were, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did a crum of bread from his Table. Therefore judge thy condition, though overflowing with many outward comforts, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an hell, till the grace of God be diſpenſed towards thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe only are preparrd to enjoy this grace of God, who do exerciſe faith in the promiſes of the Gospel.</hi> For faith is like opening of the window, that lets in this glorious light upon the ſoul. The grace of God is no otherwiſe communicated unto us, but by believing, <hi>Joh. 1. 12. To them that did believe, he gave them power to become the Sons of God.</hi> Rom. 3. 24. <hi>Juſtified freely by his grace, through faith in his bloud.</hi> So that faith is the hand to receive this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearl. And for this reaſon it is, that Gods children are no more filled with this grace; it doth not like oil runne into all their wounds, becauſe by unbelief they ſhut up their ſouls, and make ſad obſtructions unto this grace of God. Oh then, if thou who are truly godly walkeſt in a dejected manner, ſaying with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Hath God forgotten to be gracious?</hi> Know God is as gracious as ever, yea and as willing his grace ſhould overflow to thy ſoul, but thou art unwiſe and froward; thou doeſt not ſet upon this great work of faith, which is the key, as it were, to open theſe treaſures of Gods grace. Know then, that ſo much faith as thou bringeſt, ſo much of Gods grace thou ſhalt partake of. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, That to be <hi>juſtified by faith, to be ſaved by faith, and to be juſtified by grace, or ſaved by grace,</hi> is made all one by the Apoſtle, and he argueth from one to the other; and this way of Gods grace, with the manner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it cometh wholly by revelation. It's alone by the word of God, that we come to know God to be ſo gracious; and it's alone by the ſame Word, that we come to know what faith is, and how by that only, and not working, we do receive of this grace. No wonder then, if the troubled and humbled ſinner be ſo longere he comes to be repleniſhed with this grace, that he keepeth conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in fears and doubts; for till he put himſelf upon this way of faith, there is not the leaſt cranny in his ſoul, wherein the leaſt glimpſe of Gods favour can approach unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such are capable ſubjects of Gods grace, that are affected thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the leaſt diſcoveries and manifeſtations of it to the ſoul.</hi> The Sunne is not more welcome to the world, than the grace of God to a broken, contrite heart. If then the ſoul come to taſte of the ſweetneſs of it, both heart and mouth will overflow in the acknowledging of this grace. And indeed therefore doth the Lord do all out of grace to us, that as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We might be to the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 6. <hi>And that we ſhould ſhew forth the praiſe of him, who hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. So that there is nothing ſo comely and beautifull for a ſoul partaking of this grace, as to be calling upon his ſoul, and all within him to praiſe God: Yea, becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it enough, to call upon all other creatures, Angels and Saints, that they would joyn with him in this work. And certainly the dullneſs and negligence of the godly is much to be lamented in this very particular. <hi>David</hi> diſcovered this, when <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. he cals upon his <hi>ſoul to bleſſe God;</hi> and in other places, <hi>Pſal. 18. 2. Awake pſaltery and harp, I my ſelf will awake early.</hi> Why then is it thus with thee, that in temporal mercies and deliverances thou art ſo cordially ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them? If God of weak and ſick, make thee healthfull; if he recover thee from the gates of death, if he bleſs thy outward eſtate, ſo that thou art freed from the former ſtreights and perplexities thou wert in: If (I ſay) God do thus for thee, thou loveſt to take notice of it; thou canſt with tears and joy ſpeak of Gods goodneſs to thee herein; but for thoſe great and unſpeakable riches of his grace, in calling of thee, and juſtifying of thee, in beginning of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48709:65"/>
grace in thy heart; theſe things thou doſt not meditate of ſo affectionately as thou ougheſt to do. How farre otheawiſe was it with <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe heart, was like a fountain never dry, but did alwayes ſtream forth abundantly in bleſſing of God for thoſe ſpiritual mercies. Certainly were <hi>this grace of God</hi> rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by us, it would put us into holy raviſhments, it would take us off from all worldly comforts or diſcontents. The ſoul poſſeſſed with thankfull thoughts about this <hi>grace of God,</hi> will be even in Heaven it ſelf. Indeed we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this our meat and drink, and our only bleſſedneſs. Oh then abhorre thy ſelf, for not being raviſhed more with this <hi>grace of God</hi> to thee! Say, Lord, what a ſtone, what froſt and ice am I? yea worſe than they; for <hi>David</hi> calleth upon them to glorifie and praiſe God, and they do it in their kind; but I am forgetfull and dull in this bleſſed work, which is the only duty to be done to all eternity. It may be then thou feeleſt no more of this grace of God, becauſe thou are no more thankfull for the preſent enjoyments of it; and it argueth thy heart not only too dull and ſluggiſh, but too earthly and worldly, that thou doſt not bleſs God in the firſt and chiefeſt place, for the workings of his grace towards thee.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Such only are capable of the benefits of this grace, who do not abuſe it, or turn it into occaſion of ſinne.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> 4. complaineth of ſome, <hi>who did turn the grace of God into wantonneſſe.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6. 1. ſpeaketh of ſome, <hi>who encouraged themſelves to ſinne, becauſe of Gods grace.</hi> Oh take heed of falling into this <hi>Libertiniſm</hi> and <hi>licentiouſneſſe.</hi> As the ſwee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and comfortable ſhowrs of <hi>April</hi> breed frogs and other vermine, as well as pleaſant flowers: Thus the grace of God, when falling into a broken hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſoul, makes him more godly and holy; but dropping on the wicked and carnal heart, it pampereth him, and nouriſheth him the more in his ſinnes. How many ſpiders get poiſon out of theſe ſweet flowers? How many do encourage themſelves in their prophaneneſs, and go boldly on in their manifeſt impieties, hardening themſelves with the thoughts of Gods grace? Thus whereas bitter pils, the judgements of God would have conſumed their luſts; thoſe ſweet and comfortable things of Gods grace, do more confirm them in their impieties. Oh take heed of being wicked, becauſe God is gracious! For thou wilt find, though he be infinitely gracious, and that to great ſinners, when repenting and humbling themſelves, yet to ſuch as abuſe and turn his grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an occaſion of ſinne, the hotteſt flames of his anger will fall upon ſuch.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Conſider ſome <hi>Rules,</hi> how rightly to underſtand and judge <note place="margin">Rules how we may rightly underſtand and judge of the grace of God.</note> of this grace of God. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>You muſt know that there are thoſe who extreamly erre about the grace of God, and yet are directly oppoſite to one another.</hi> The <hi>Pelagian,</hi> the <hi>Papiſt, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> and <hi>Secinian;</hi> all theſe do more or leſſe diminiſh, and nullifie the grace of God. For howſoever they have many plauſible and ſpecious diſtinctions, by which they would evade to be thought enemies to Gods grace, yet unleſs we give all to grace, we make it no grace at all. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> known aſſertion is very true, <hi>Gratia non eſt gratia ullo modo, niſi ſit gratuita omni modo.</hi> The <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old did deceive the Eaſtern Church, by granting, That all thoſe were to be anathematized, who did not hold the grace of God neceſſary to every good work: And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> with the <hi>Arminians,</hi> do carry it ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, as if they indeed did ſet up grace more than their Adverſaries. Let not therefore every one that ſpeaketh of grace, be preſently accounted Orthodox, and to endure the Scripture-proof and trial. Again, on the other ſide, there are <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who do erre grievouſly, though they only would be thought to admire free grace, condemning all as Legal Preachers, and of an Old Teſtament ſpirit, that do not ſpeak of grace, as they do. Now God is ſo gracious theſe tell us
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48709:66"/>
to his people, <hi>That he ſeeth no ſinne in them, that he doth not afflict for ſinne.</hi> They tell us of ſuch a grace, That God looketh upon us, as if we were Chriſt himſelf, and that he doth this from all eternity: That <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, while a perſecuter and blaſphemer, was as much in the love and grace of God, as after his converſion: That the vileſt and moſt wicked of men, even while they are ſo, are to receive Chriſt as a Saviour: That neither ſinnes or good works do at all marre, or make our peace: That faith juſtifieth only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively, by manifeſting unto us, That God did from all eternity juſtifie us. Theſe and ſuch like poiſonous tenents they affirm, and this (they ſay) is to preach <hi>free grace.</hi> Thus you ſee the <hi>grace of God</hi> may be oppoſed on the right hand, and on the left.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, take this Rule, <hi>That we muſt not exalt grace according to our own fancies and opinions, making ſuch a grace as we would have, and then go to the Scripture to confirm it; but the word of God muſt be the alone Rule in this caſe.</hi> So that by the Scripture alone, we ſhall not give too little, nor on the other ſide attribute too much to it, making Gods grace to be ſuch a thing not indeed as it is, but ſuch as we would have. It is good therefore to attend to the Scripture, and to lay all our own thoughts and all humane Authorities aſide, that ſo the Scripture grace of God may be found out.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Characters we may have of that grace the Scripture commends <note place="margin">The Scripture characters of the grace of God.</note> in God:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Scripture-grace doth begin all the good in us.</hi> We do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent God, but he prevents us. Thus our Saviour, <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you: We love him, becauſe he loved us first.</hi> So that the word of God doth ſtill reſolve the original of all we have into this <hi>grace of God,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and <hi>Rom. 11. Epheſ.</hi> 1. Whoſoever therefore makes ſomething in us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and then Gods grace to be ſubſequent; he ſetteth not up grace in a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-way. Therefore there are no antecedent merits or diſpoſitions in us, for which God doth afterwards beſtow his grace upon us. The very firſt deſire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and leaſt unſeigned groans after Chriſt is from this <hi>grace of God.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginnings of what is good; is attributed to God, as well as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſives, yea the initials moſt of all, becauſe then we were dead in ſin, and in a ſtate of enmity againſt God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The grace of God which the Scripture commends, as to our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and converſion is not meerly ſuaſory, and by moral arguments, or in an univerſal, indeterminate and ineffectual manner, till we by our freewill content to it; but it's a grace that takes away the heart of ſtone, and giveth an heart of fleſh; it's a grace that gives a new birth, and maketh us new creatures.</hi> Which expreſſions do ſuppoſe, that we had not ſo much power, as to conſent unto grace, till grace doth enable us. It is a grace that giveth us <hi>both to will and to do.</hi> It's a grace that makes us to be what we are, and ſo to differ from another, whereas if we did co-operate with grace, or make Gods grace effectual, then it would be we our ſelves, and not Gods grace that ſhould make this difference.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The grace of God which the Scripture commends, as to our Juſtification is <hi>imputed grace, not inherent,</hi> evangelical grace which juſtifieth us, is exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, though by faith received into us, and made ours. And this is greatly to be obſerved, for what godly man, when he goeth for Juſtification and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth not more attend to inherent grace, than imputed? This truth is the very heart and marrow of the Goſpel. It is about this that there is ſo much do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal and practical contending, Whether grace inherent in us, or imputed to us, be that which we muſt reſt upon, and lean upon, when God enters into judgement with us? We ſay only <hi>imputed grace;</hi> others ſay, <hi>inherent;</hi> and that becauſe the Apoſtle excludeth works; not only meritorious work, but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48709:66"/>
works, works of grace done by us. And here now the Adverſaries ſeem to inſult, ſaying, The Apoſtle excludeth works only of <hi>the Law,</hi> ſuch as are done by our natural ſtrength, or perfect works, or works that merit; but this is to diſtinguiſh where the Scripture doth not; and whereas it is ſaid, that the works of grace cannot be oppoſed to grace, becauſe they flow from it, they are effects of it. It's anſwered, that works of grace cannot indeed be oppoſed to that principle of grace within us, from whence they are ſaid to flow; but they are oppoſed to that grace, which is ſaid to be the effect of them, <hi>viz. Juſtification and remiſſion of ſins.</hi> So that though <hi>works of grace</hi> do not oppoſe <hi>internal renovation,</hi> yet they do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, which they ſay is produced by them. Again, whereas they ſay, That none extoll grace more than they do, becauſe they make grace inherent to make us accepted of with God. Whereas the Proteſtants debate it, denying it this noble work. For (ſay they) will not grace be moſt advanced in Heaven, when we ſhall be juſtified by that perfection of holineſs which is within us? But to this alſo it's anſwered, That it's <hi>imputed grace,</hi> which is <hi>Evangelical grace,</hi> and that we are to exalt in this life. In Heaven indeed this <hi>Evangelical</hi> and <hi>imputed grace</hi> will ceaſe, though all glory will be given to that, becauſe by it we are brought to perfect inherent grace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Scripture-grace, though it be not for good duties, yet doth alwayes require the ſtudy of them, and diligent attending thereunto.</hi> So that as we muſt not with the <hi>Papiſt</hi> make our <hi>duties</hi> thruſt out <hi>grace;</hi> ſo neither muſt we with the <hi>Antinomians</hi> make <hi>grace</hi> to thruſt out <hi>duties,</hi> for both theſe do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together. Therefore as the Scripture ſpeaks of Gods grace, ſo it doth alſo of thoſe holy duties, which if we do not diligently perform, we cannot have any portion in everlaſting happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Admonition,</hi> To pray for that ſpiritual wiſdome, that we may joyn Gods grace and our holineſs, to be conſcionable in performing of the later, but to relie only upon the former: Eſpecially take heed of ſuch wayes and courſes that ſhall put thee out of this warm Sunne, that ſhall make thee to walk in darkneſs, not feeling the comfortable beams thereof. Oh remember, it is this alone, that makes life and death comfortable. It is true, thou mayeſt be under this grace of God, yet by ſome cloudy temptations upon thy ſoul thou not be able to perceive. Oh but let thy earneſt prayer be, That Gods grace may not only be to thee, but this may be evidenced to thee. Thou canſt never have true ſolid peace, and quiet contentation of ſoul, till this be all the food (as it were) thou liveſt upon; till this be all the cloaths thou covereſt thy nakedneſs with.</p>

               <p>VVE are now come to the ſecond thing, which the Apoſtle doth ſo cordially wiſh theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that is <hi>Peace. Grace</hi> is the Cauſe, <hi>Peace</hi> is the Effect. <hi>Grace</hi> is the fountain, <hi>Peace</hi> is the ſtream.</p>
               <p>This word <hi>Peace</hi> among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> comes from a root ſignifying, <hi>to be whole and ſound,</hi> becauſe by <hi>Peace</hi> they did mean all good and proſperity, as by Warre, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word coming from a root, ſignifying <hi>to eat and devour,</hi> they meant all miſery and deſtruction. And among the <hi>Hebrews</hi> this was their ordinary ſalutation and greeting, <hi>Peace be to you,</hi> intending thereby all proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and happineſs: And ſo ſome expound it here by <hi>Peace,</hi> underſtanding a proſperous and ſucceſſefull proceeding of all their affairs: But though this is not to be excluded; yet we take <hi>Peace</hi> in the ſame ſphere with <hi>Grace;</hi> and as that did relate chiefly to ſpiritual things, ſo alſo muſt this <hi>Peace</hi> in the Text.</p>

               <p>Let us firſt take notice of the nature of it briefly. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This peace lieth in the favour and grace of God, ſo that his anger and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wherein this peace conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> 
                  <hi>wrath, becauſe of ſinne, is wholly removed.</hi> For where Gods wrath is upon a man, where his face is ſet againſt him, that man hath no peace, <hi>Iſa 57. 21. There is no peace, ſaith my God to the wicked.</hi> Therefore though wicked men are for a while in carnal jollity, and in much ſecurity, crying, <hi>Peace, peace</hi> to themſelves, as 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 3. even <hi>then deſtruction ſhall ſuddenly ſurprize them.</hi> The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could ſay of a wicked man, That though he might be <hi>ſecurus,</hi> yet he was never <hi>tutus:</hi> Though he might caſt away all care and fear, bidding his ſoul, as <hi>Dives, to take its eaſe,</hi> yet he is never ſafe; for in the midſt of this ſecurity, he heareth that dreadfull voice, <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be taken away.</hi> Let then the wicked men tremble and quake like <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> for they may ſee, not one, but many hand-writings, not in a wall, but in the word of God, fore-telling them without repentance of their certain damnation. This peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begins firſt in Heaven, and ſo deſcends into a mans heart. God removeth his anger, becauſe of our ſins; he is become a gracious and reconciled Father, and hence we have peace. Therefore <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. it is called, <hi>Peace with God;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that if we had peace with all the Potentates of the world; if we had peace with the world, which yet Chriſts Diſciples ſhall never have, yet this is nothing to <hi>peace with God.</hi> For how many have ventured to obtain outward peace, as <hi>Spira</hi> and others, by breaking this peace; and thereupon have plunged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a very Hell? What peace can any in the world give thee, if God cauſe his anger to break out againſt thee?</p>
               <p>Secondly, This peace, as it doth conſiſtin reconciliation with God; ſo alſo it hath <hi>the ſenſe and perſwaſion of this, it brings a man to ſome comfortable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and evidence of this.</hi> For although Gods anger be removed, our ſins be forgiven, and on Gods part all controverſies are removed againſt us, yet if we do not know this, if we are not aſſured our hearts are us much troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, as if God indeed were our adverſary. Hence it is that the Spirit of God is ſent into our hearts, enabling us to call God <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> For if we could not do ſo, it would be as the Sunne, though it caſts forth glorious beams of light, yet a blind man, becauſe he cannot ſee it, it is all one, as if it were mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: ſo unleſs the Spirit of God doth make thee to diſcern thoſe gifts of the Spirit in thee, as by the light of the Sunne we come to ſee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e: ſo alſo, though God be our Father, though we be his dear children, yet if we are not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of this, ſtill this peace is not in our hearts; it muſt be therefore in <hi>Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and our aſſurance of this faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This peace therefore is not procured or wrought by our own ſtrength.</hi> If we would give ten thouſand worlds, when our hearts are ſeorched and burn like hell through the ſenſe of Gods diſpleaſure, we are not able to refreſh our ſouls with one drop of it. That as all the men of the world are not able to make the Sunne ariſe, if God forbid it; Neither can the parched wilderneſs water it ſelf, till God prepare clouds to empty themſelves upon it: Thus it is with it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>umble contrite heart, praying, groaning, crying out for this bleſſed peace in ſoul: Alas it cannot come, till God command it. Therefore he is ſo often called, the <hi>God of peace,</hi> Rom. 16 20. Heb. 13. 20. And <hi>peace is made the fruit of Gods Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle in this Text prayeth for it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as knowing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> can never have it, unleſs it be given them from above. This therefore ſhould o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> us of our ſelves; think not to have it by any works thou doeſt; think not outward advantages can help then to it: No, it

muſt be by a lowly humble dependance upon God, <hi>Deſcendendo, in Coelum aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>As it is wrought by God, ſo it is purchaſed by Chriſt our Mediatour.</hi> For although he be alſo the efficient cauſe of peace, called therefore <hi>Iſai. 9. The Prince of peace,</hi> and <hi>The King of peace,</hi> Heb. 7. 2. yet he is chiefly called <hi>our peace,</hi> becauſe by him our peace is purchaſed, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 14. Coloſ.</hi> 1. 20. Hence it was, that upon Chriſts birth thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſang, <hi>Glory be to God on High, and peace on Earth, good will towards men.</hi> So that had it not been for Chriſt living and dying to remove the curſe of the Law from us, there had been no more hope of peace for us, than the Devils and damned in Hell. Though with <hi>Dives</hi> we had called but for a drop of water, yet the gulph being not removed between God and us, we could not have enjoyed it. It's then a peace through Chriſts bloud; we have it at a very dear price: Hence <hi>Iſai. 53. The chaſtiſement of our peace</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to be upon him,</hi> that chaſtiſement and wounds which brought peace to us. And truly this is much to be meditated on. For what man conſidering his ſinfulneſs, his unworthineſs, can perſwade himſelf, that God will have any peace with ſuch as he is? Do we not ſee what a laborious work it is to bring the troubled and loaden ſoul to Chriſt for eaſe? How many times ready to deſpair? What conſtant qualms and ſwoons of ſoul? How often with the Diſciples crying out, <hi>I periſh, I periſh?</hi> And is not all this, becauſe they think their ſinnes have ſo offended God, he is ſo provoked againſt them, that they can never obtain reconciliation? Doth not this proneneſs to unbelief and deſpair, ariſe from not conſidering, that the chaſtiſements of our peace are upon Chriſt? Were we with our tears or graces, to work our peace, then our eſtate would be incurable? But Chriſt is our peace-maker; and if peace-makers among men are bleſſed, How bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, who made peace between man and God?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Faith is the hand to receive and imbrace this peace; by believing we come to have this heavenly tranquillity.</hi> Thoſe that are ſtrangers to this life of faith, are alſo ſtrangers to this life of peace. <hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> It's faith that prepareth the way for peace, <hi>Iſai. 26. 3. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee in perfect peace, peace; peace,</hi> as in the original, full and univerſal peace. But how ſhall he thus be kept? By truſting and ſtaying his mind on God. So <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27. 5. God there invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth men to believe, which is emphatically called, a laying hold upon God, <hi>Let him take hold on me, that he may make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me. Take hold,</hi> as we do upon a man that is turning away from us, and ſeemeth to be offended with us; but we lay hold on him, intreating him to look upon us. This doth faith; and therefore by it we are ſaid to <hi>have boldneſs.</hi> Oh then acquaint thy ſelf more with this life of faith! If you ſee a tree wither in all its branches and boughs, it is becauſe it dieth at the root: So if you ſee a Chriſtian abating in his peace, in his joy, in his conſolations, it is becauſe faith is weak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. This is the breaſt that gives ſuck (as it were) to all the ſerenity we enjoy.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>This peace, as it is thus wrought by God in us, and received by faith; ſo it is conſerved and preſerved by an holy and diligent attending to the exerciſe of all grace.</hi> For although a godly life be not a cauſe of this peace, yet it is alwayes conjoyned with it; and our negligence and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs will be like an <hi>Eclipſe</hi> to this Sunne, it will darken and obnubilate the whole ſoul. Hence this peace, and a wilfull courſe of wickedneſs can
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48709:68"/>
no more ſtand together, than the Sunne and night. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. biddeth us, <hi>Give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure,</hi> which is, <hi>by adding of one grace to another.</hi> Hence <hi>Rom. 8. 6. To be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually minded,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>life and peace.</hi> No wonder then if Gods own children do ſo ſeldom attain to a calm and peaceable frame; they are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcouraged often; they are caſt down and hopeleſs often; they are full of tormenting fears often; for whence is this? but becauſe Gods own people are ſubject to dulneſs, ſlothfulneſs, they break their peace, they interrupt this communion, they do not keep the oil alwayes ready to keep the lamp burning. Oh then ſay to thy ſoul, why am I a man of ſo little peace within me? Why do I find like <hi>Rehekkah</hi> two ſtrugling within me, <hi>faith</hi> againſt <hi>diffidence, joy</hi> againſt <hi>ſadneſſe, hope</hi> againſt <hi>fear?</hi> Is not all this from my own folly and vanity? The way then to keep this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed peace, is to walk with all diligence in the whole courſe of all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>This peaceable calme, and joyfull dispoſition of the ſoul, is the proper effect and fruit of the Gospel.</hi> This is the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>al and Evangelical tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per we under the Goſpel, and the Spirit of Adoption, ought to walk in. We may ſtand and wonder to ſee, what great expreſſions <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and in other places, concerning <hi>the love of God in Chriſt;</hi> how conſident and aſſured of it, how triumphing over all difficulties, as if he were in Heaven already. For the glorified Saints can ſcarce ſay more than he doth. And this he ſpeaketh, not in his own behalf, but in the name of all the children of God, they ought to have ſuch peace, aſſurance, and filial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, as he hath. Now alas, we are like worms crawling on the ground in compariſon of him! We ſpend our dayes in tumults, fears and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart: We are toſſed from one temptation to another, and have not this <hi>peace,</hi> this <hi>joy unspeakable,</hi> this <hi>Evangelical perſwaſion,</hi> and why? but becauſe the Goſpel hath not had its full work upon us. Doth not the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and in other places, ſpeak of the <hi>Miniſtration of the Law, killing and condemning?</hi> Doth he not ſpeak of a <hi>ſpirit of bondage,</hi> and of <hi>ſervants</hi> as oppoſite to <hi>children?</hi> And as the immediate contrary to this, he tels us of the <hi>Miniſtration of the Gospel,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of Adoption</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it, <hi>which Spirit we are to pray for;</hi> and are to be <hi>transformed more and more from glory to glory, by beholding of the glory of God revealed in the Gospel.</hi> Therefore <hi>Epheſ. 6. 15. We are to have our feet ſhod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace; We tread among thorns and briars.</hi> Now this Goſpel munition is the only defence againſt all hinderances in our way to Heaven. Oh beloved, let us at laſt know, that the Goſpel doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt in an holy, exact, and humble walking, but in a chearfull, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and gladſome converſation, ariſing from the ſenſe of Gods grace to us in Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh fully to this, <hi>Rom. 14. 17. The Kingdome of God is not meat or drink, but righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> You ſee here the Kingdome of God is not onely in <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> but in this <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy.</hi> Did the children of God poſſeſs their ſouls with this truth, they would no more let in unbelief and diſcouragements into their ſoul, then they would the prince of darkneſs, and his Angels? Know therfore, that though thou haſt lived ſo many years under the Goſpel, yet till thou obtaineſt this peaceable calm frame of ſoul, coming from the love of God in Chriſt, thou haſt not the Goſpel-work in its full upon thee. Do not live as if thou hadſt only received the Spirit of bondage to fear, but the Spirit of adoption and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation alſo. And know this aſſuredly, That the more any Chriſtian groweth under the Goſpel, the more this diſpenſation affects him, the nearer in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and lovely imbracements by <hi>faith,</hi> he cometh unto God as a Father,

               <p>WE are treating upon this admirable and unſpeakable priviledge of <hi>Peace from God.</hi> It is a <hi>Peace from God,</hi> and it is a <hi>Peace with God.</hi> You have heard ſeveral particulars going to the conſtitution of it, there yet remain more.</p>
               <p>In the next place therefore, <hi>This peace here prayed for, is a peace in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conſiderations, becauſe our perſons are juſtified, our ſinnes are forgiven, therefore we have peace.</hi> As <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. there is an external worldly peace, which the natural men of the world only deſire; let them live in peace and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, let them have the good things of this world, with the peaceable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, this is the utmoſt of their deſire, they think this is enough. We ſee this notably, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 10, 16. where the people deſire ſuch Prophets only, that will <hi>propheſie of peace to them.</hi> Peace is ſo loved, that therefore wicked men do ſo extreamly hate the faithfull Meſſengers of God, becauſe they <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim no peace to them;</hi> they enform them of Gods wrath and vengeance againſt ſuch; now this cutteth them to the very heart: They delight only in ſuch
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48709:69"/>
                  <hi>peacemongers,</hi> that though they go on in all wickedneſs and prophaneneſs, yet you muſt tell them all is well, <hi>ſow pillows under their elbows,</hi> that they may lie down in ſecurity. Men that deſire to ſleep, love not to hear any noiſe; but the <hi>Peace</hi> in the Text, is not bred from ſuch baſe and low materials. When the wicked man is deprived of his pleaſure, his profits, then all his peace is gone: but the godly doth many times partake in the moſt powerfull manner of this peace, when they are in the moſt afflicted and wretched eſtate, becauſe this peace is within, and upon ſpiritual grounds. And therefore when the godly many times have moſt of outward troubles; they do richly abound with this <hi>ſpiritual inward peace.</hi> Hence it is that a gracious ſpiritual heart doth only prize it, and pray for it: The natural man not perceiving theſe things, which muſt be ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Whereas a godly mans trouble may ariſe ſeveral wayes, this peace</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What are the principal cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a godly mans fears, troubles and diſquietneſſes.</note> 
                  <hi>hath a proper antidote and cure in all theſe respects, from what cauſes a godly mans diſquietneſſe and fears may ariſe, from the contrary will his peace.</hi> As for example, a godly man is very frequently diſturbed, becauſe of the ſenſe of Gods anger for ſinne, becauſe he is not reconciled, ſuch and ſuch ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have provoked God to hide his face, and this filleth him with all bitterneſs; he will not be called <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah;</hi> but when this peace of God poſſeſſeth the ſoul, then all theſe dark thoughts do preſently flie away, as when the Sunne ariſeth, the night is diſpelled. So that when thou thinkeſt of God, and art troubled; <hi>Thy meditation of him is not,</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids, ſweet,</hi> but <hi>bitter;</hi> this wholly ariſeth from want of this peace, for that will confirm and ſettle the ſoul in all references to God, that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him to be a gracious reconciled Father.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>A mans trouble may ariſe in his ſoul, from the temptations and oppoſitions of Satan, who when he cannot hinder Gods people in the exerciſe of their graces, will in respect of their comforts.</hi> So that as the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is the <hi>Comforter,</hi> one great work of his being to aſſure, to enable to call <hi>God Father:</hi> So the Devil he is the prince of darkneſs, and he counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works Gods Spirit. As that is an <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> ſanctifying his people; ſo he is an <hi>unclean ſpirit,</hi> provoking to all ſinne. Again, as <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> doth comfort and convince us of <hi>Chriſts righteouſneſſe,</hi> being the <hi>Spirit of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> within us, to deliver us from <hi>ſpiritual bondage</hi> and <hi>thraldome:</hi> So the <hi>Devil</hi> he worketh oppoſitely to all this; he filleth the heart with ſad and unbelieving ſuggeſtions; he endeavours to divide between God and us, to make us afraid of him, as being that ſevere Judge, who will not in any wiſe be reconciled. Thus he would perſwade us, that it is with us, as it is with him, and that there is no more hope for comfort and ſalvation for us, than for him. But this <hi>peace of God</hi> doth abundantly fortifie againſt this temptation alſo; where this <hi>peace</hi> is, the <hi>Devil</hi> doth not find the <hi>houſe ſwept and garniſhed,</hi> but fortified and ſecured againſt him, ſo that he cannot have any entrance. This is the bleſſed effect of this <hi>ſpiritual peace,</hi> that it <hi>overcometh the Devil;</hi> he commonly entreth into the good tender heart by unbelief, by fears, by propounding doubtfull and anxious ſcruples, and then draweth us into a wilderneſs farre off from God: But this <hi>peace from God</hi> doth eaſily <hi>quench all his fiery-darts,</hi> doth preſently ſtop his aſſaults, and maketh him not care for coming to us to graple with us, while we have this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual armoury on.</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>Our diſquietneſſe doth many times ariſe from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of original corruption within us.</hi> The godly they find many ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and workings of the root of corruption within them: They find that their hearts are not in ſuch an uniform and heavenly way, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; they often come ſhort of what they endeavour after. And ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48709:70"/>
thus foiled often by their luſts, they begin to be full of fears, and of all doubts; they queſtion their own ſincerity, and what Rock they are built upon; hereupon they are pierced thorow with many wounding apprehenſions; and have no reſt in their bones; but when this <hi>peace from God,</hi> doth begin to ſtirre in their hearts, then all theſe fears vaniſh: They ſee <hi>peace with God,</hi> and remainders of corruption may ſtand together, ſo long as they do not make <hi>proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> or <hi>give themſelves up to ſinne willingly,</hi> but are <hi>captivated</hi> therein, ſo long Gods favour and love is not removed from them. This <hi>peace</hi> (they now ſee) is not bottomed upon a pure and perfect heart, free from any evil at all; for then no <hi>David,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> could have <hi>peace,</hi> but from the grace of God through Chriſt, mercifully forgiving thoſe fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and imperfections which we are burdened with.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The godly mans peace is many times greatly interrupted from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, becauſe of the hatred and malice of the world:</hi> But <hi>Chriſts peace</hi> is an excellent antidote againſt that alſo, <hi>John 14. 27. John</hi> 16. 33. Chriſt there <hi>bequeaths his peace to them,</hi> and from this ground, <hi>Becauſe in the world they ſhall have trouble.</hi> Let the winds and clouds be never ſo impetuous, yet they cannot moleſt the upper region, that is above their reach: So it is here, Let men and Devils ſet themſelves againſt the godly with all their rage and madneſs; Let them revile them, impriſon them, yea kill them, yet they cannot take away their <hi>peace</hi> from them. So that unleſs they could as <hi>Black</hi> would have done, get <hi>God to curſe his children:</hi> All the curſes and violent oppoſitions of the world, are ſo farre from weakning, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſe and ſtrengthen their <hi>peace.</hi> Thus you ſee what large territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries this <hi>peace of God</hi> hath, that it doth extend it ſelf into large dimenſions. And oh how bleſſed and happy is that man, who hath this <hi>peace</hi> compaſſing him about in every reſpect! This is not only <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. but three or four times <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> from every ſide, from within and without. Why then is not the true believer more folicitous to poſſeſs himſelf of this crown of mercies?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This peace of God, ariſing from Gods favour in Chriſt, hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and ſovereign effects, which may move us to the attainment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What are the effects of this Goſpel-peace.</note> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Where this peace of God is, it will wonderfully compoſe and ſettle the ſoul.</hi> This is the genuine, and immediate conſequent of Gods peace in the ſoul; it putteth the whole ſoul into an excellent harmony. There are not thoſe waves and tumults, thoſe diviſions and diſtractions of ſoul, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times do greatly perplex the godly: Do we not ſee an univerſal want of this peace generally amongſt believers? Whence ariſe thoſe troubles, thoſe concuſſions of ſoul? Why doeſt thou need ſo often to chide and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thy ſelf, ſaying, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? and why art thou ſo diſquieted within thee?</hi> Do not all theſe things ariſe, becauſe thy heart is not at reſt and quietneſs within thee? The <hi>Heathens</hi> ſpeak much of their <hi>Socrates,</hi> becauſe he was noted to be alwayes; <hi>Eodem vultu,</hi> of <hi>the ſame countenance;</hi> if this were true, it did not ariſe from this <hi>Chriſtian peace,</hi> but from ſome <hi>Stoical,</hi> or other <hi>Philoſophical principles,</hi> which did ſpeak much to this tranquillity of mind, but yet pleaſed themſelves with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, never enjoying the ſubſtance. <hi>David</hi> doth notably expreſs the effects of this peace, <hi>Pſal. 48. I will both lay me down in peace, and ſleep, becauſe thou Lord alone makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. we have a large deſcription of a ſerene and pacified mind without any dividing cares of ſoul. As alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 3. his <hi>Heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord.</hi> Thus this <hi>peace of God</hi> keeps all quiet, and ſubdueth all troubleſome inſurrections, and motions of ſoul. Hence <hi>Coloſ. 3. 15. Phil.</hi> 4. 17. this <hi>peace of God</hi> is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48709:70"/>
ſaid to <hi>rule in our hearts,</hi> and <hi>to keep our hearts,</hi> as an Army, Gariſon, a Strong-hold, ſo that none dare make any oppoſition, or reſiſtance. Thus doth the <hi>peace of God,</hi> it is of ſuch ſovereign dominion in our hearts, that it keeps down unbelief, and all unruly paſſions of ſoul. Doe not then be a <hi>Magor-miſſabib</hi> to thy own ſelf, when God calleth thee to peace, doe not thou ſet all at variance, and diſcord within thy ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This peace of God worketh as a conſequent from the former, a gracious contentation of ſoul under all conditions and eſtates.</hi> So that whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him, he is the <hi>Lapis quadratus,</hi> he is built on a Rock, nothing can overwhelm his peace; grieved he may be, ſadded he may be, becauſe of ſome paſſages even from God againſt him, yet his <hi>peace</hi> he is never to let go, for that alone makes the ſoul contented. Though his conditions alter, and he is toſſed up and down ſeveral wayes, yet becauſe of <hi>peace with God,</hi> he can follow the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and though with diſproportion ſay, <hi>I know how to abound, and how to want; I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> Phil. 4. 12. Whereas if this <hi>peace of God</hi> be taken from the ſoul, then is the heart of a man like one burning in an hot fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, toſſing from one place to another, hoping to find ſome eaſe, but can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain none.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This peace of God filleth the heart with joy and boldneſſe at the throne of grace.</hi> For as when the Sunne ariſeth, the dark clouds they are ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Thus when the <hi>peace of God</hi> doth ſhine into our ſouls, then the heart is <hi>filled with joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. it is called <hi>unspeakable joy, and full of glory:</hi> Inſomuch that ſuch who live in this manner, have Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eternal life already begun in their ſouls. It is not according to the Spirit of God, that thou ſhouldſt be heaping up ſad thoughts againſt thy ſelf; Gods Spirit is a comforting Spirit, as it doth all in us for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo alſo for conſolation. It is not <hi>Spiritus Calvinianus,</hi> but <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticus,</hi> that may be truly called <hi>Melancholicus;</hi> for the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Doctrine preacheth and preſſeth the aſſuring work of Gods Spirit to the ſoul, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of perſeverance to ſuch who have been partakers of the leaſt true grace; but <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine and others commend doubtings, deny certain perſeverance of the true Saints; and therefore upon this account, as well as for other reaſons, they may be rejected, becauſe they tend to the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the conſolation of Gods children. Oh then know, that a ſpiritual life, is a life ſutable to the Spirit of God, is a comfortable glad walking, as well as an holy, and a ſanctified one.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Where this peace from God is, there is a greater incentive and quickning to all holineſſe and godlineſſe.</hi> There the ſoul is carried out with more fervency and activity, ſcruples and dejected thoughts, they are like the taking off the Chariot-wheels; there cannot be ſuch improved godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuch zealous and laborious expreſſions of love and thankfulneſs to God, as when this <hi>peace of God</hi> ruleth in our heart. The fire doth not more eaſily diſſolve the froſt and ice, then this <hi>peace of God</hi> in our ſouls doth chaſe away all ſlothfulneſs and negligence; if this <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>peace of God</hi> were ſhed abroad in thy heart, thou wouldſt like a <hi>Gyant</hi> runne thy race of Chriſtianity, whereas now thou art but a <hi>Dwarf;</hi> feeble hands and weak knees will not go through much work, eſpecially if difficult and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Now the way of Chriſtianity is compared to a race, to fighting and combating: there are thouſands of diſcouragements and oppoſitions in the way; it behoveth thee therefore to have this peace within, that ſo the work of grace begun in thee, may go on more proſperouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48709:71"/>
But you will ſay, <hi>This indeed is a mercy, like that</hi> Pearl <hi>in the Parable,</hi> we may well fell all to have it: <hi>But how may we be directed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take notice of theſe things briefly: <note place="margin">Directions how to attain this peace.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Diſtinguiſh between carnal preſumption, and this peace from God.</hi> Many have been deluded by taking one for the other. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> did confidently boaſt in God as their Father, and that they were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams ſeed;</hi> the <hi>Covenants of Grace</hi> did belong to them; yet who were further off from it than they were? When the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, I thank thee I am not like other men,</hi> he might have boldneſs and confidence upon his ſoul; but yet here was no true peace. And thus there are many hundreds who have quiet, ſtill, and it may be feared, ſtupified conſciences: Now theſe find no trouble, no aches, or pains of heart, becauſe of ſinne, but thank their good God, all is well with them, when yet alas they are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, being upon the very borders of Hell, in which they may fall every moment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of living in ſinne, or omitting of thoſe Duties God requireth of thee.</hi> For although theſe be not the cauſe of this <hi>peace</hi> in thee, yet without theſe no peace can either be obtained or preſerved. This is to be throwing water upon the fire, till it quite go out.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Perſwade thy ſelf of thoſe Doctrinal Truths againſt the contrary Errours, which help to eſtabliſh this peace:</hi> Such as the Nature of <hi>Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith,</hi> in the particular application of it; as alſo, not only the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but the duty of <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> the <hi>certain,</hi> and <hi>unchangeable love of God,</hi> to all thoſe who are his; as alſo the <hi>acceptableneſſe of ſuch a quiet and joyfull ſpirit unto God himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Regard Gods promiſes as well as precepts.</hi> Look upon the <hi>Gospel</hi> as well as the Law; let not one deſtroy the other, but make them to be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient in thy whole life.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Pray much for the Spirit of Adoption.</hi> For it is not thy own power, or meditation upon all the Rules that Miniſters may give, which will give this peace of God, till the Spirit of Adoption doe reigne in thee.</p>

               <p>We ſhall diſpatch all theſe particulars briefly.</p>

                  </gap>, whether that word come from <hi>fear,</hi> or to <hi>runne,</hi> or to <hi>behold,</hi> is doubted of. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> there are ſeveral <hi>Names</hi> given to God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the <hi>Rabbins</hi> call him <hi>Haſhem, the Name.</hi> Whether God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf revealed his Name to <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> impoſed a name upon him, it is hard to determine. This is certain, that the Scripture names do very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically repreſent the Nature of God, eſpecially thoſe two <hi>Jehovah</hi> and <hi>Elohim.</hi> The word <hi>Jehovah</hi> is commonly rendred by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, yet in the New Teſtament, Chriſt is commonly called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and God the Father <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, eſpecially when named together, as is to be ſhewed in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes following.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe two mentioned words, one in the <hi>ſingular,</hi> the other is in the <hi>plural,</hi> which doth denote (eſpecially having light from other places of Scripture) that there is <hi>One Divine Nature,</hi> and <hi>Three Perſons.</hi> Hence ſometimes <hi>Jehovah Elohim</hi> is put together; although alſo the former word ſignifieth the fulneſs of Gods being, and giving being to other things. For which reaſon (ſay ſome) he is not named <hi>Jehovah</hi> till the ſecond Chapter in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> when all things were compleated; and in another place, God is ſaid, <hi>Not to be known by the Name Jehovah,</hi> Exod. 6. 3. becauſe they had not ſeen the great things promiſed, accompliſhed; and <hi>Elohim</hi> denoteth God, as governing and ruling the world; in which ſenſe, the <hi>fool</hi> is ſaid to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48709:72"/>
affirm, <hi>There is no God,</hi> no <hi>Elohim,</hi> Pſal. 14. 1. Yet having light from other places of Scripture, eſpecially from the New Teſtament, we ought not to reject this conſideration, that therefore <hi>Jehovah</hi> is in the ſingular number; and <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> in the plural, to ſignifie the <hi>One Nature,</hi> and <hi>Three Perſons.</hi> For though from the plural number meerly, we cannot pitch upon the number three more than four, yet from other places joyned to this we may. So then, as God in making of man, ſpake in the plural number; ſo we ſhall find in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in other places ſpeaking of God, as <hi>Makers,</hi> in the plural number, <hi>Iſa. 54. 5. Pſal. 149. 2. Job</hi> 35. 9. for this reaſon. Though ſome Divines dare not ſay, <hi>Tres Jehovae, Three Jehovahs,</hi> yet they ſay, <hi>Three Elohims,</hi> as <hi>Zanchy</hi> nameth a piece of his works. Indeed there are others, who do wholly reject and diſlike that expreſſion. The word God is applied ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>properly,</hi> ſometimes <hi>improperly. Improperly,</hi> ſo it is given to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Magistrates.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>They are</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That God alone can vouchſafe this grace and peace to his people.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God alone can give grace and peace to his people.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is part of Gods <hi>Regalia,</hi> There are many things that the creatures can do as ſecond cauſes; but here God is the alone efficient. We remain, as it were, in ſo many tormenting Hels, till God cauſe his face to ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Hence (you heard) God is called the <hi>God of peace;</hi> and as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the next verſe, <hi>The God of all conſolation.</hi> As therefore God is the fountain of holineſs, ſo that there cannot be the leaſt degree of holineſs wrought in thee, without it come from above, thou haſt no free-will or power of thy own to procure it: So it is in matter of conſolation and peace. There is not the leaſt drop of comfort can fall into thy heart to refreſh it, till God pour it into thee.</p>
               <p>I ſhall briefly mention ſome grounds of this, becauſe it will be more largely handled in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God alone can give this grace and peace, Becauſe he was at firſt the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> 
                  <hi>maker of the heart, he is the Father of all fleſh, and of all ſpirits.</hi> Having therefore ſuch an immediate dominion over the heart of man, to put into it what he pleaſeth, to raiſe up what affections he will; no wonder if he alone giveth comfort. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaketh fully to this, <hi>Job 35. 10. None ſaith, where is God my maker, that giveth ſongs in the night? In the night]</hi> when the ſoul may be moſt poſſeſſed with ſad and dejected thoughts, even then he can <hi>give ſongs,</hi> and that becauſe he is a <hi>maker:</hi> That as he who maketh an inſtrument of Art, the Clock or Watch, he can make it ſtrike, when, and how he pleaſeth; if there be any hinderance in the motions of it, he can preſently rectifie it, becauſe he made it; thus it is with God, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the workings, and turnings of thy heart, he made every power and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48709:72"/>
ability of thy ſoul, and ſo he alone can fill it with joy or bitterneſs, as he pleaſeth. Though our hearts be not in our power, yet they are in Gods power, and what he bids it think, it thinketh; whereas we have not our own thoughts and motions in our own power. It is God therefore that made the heart, who can make it peaceable and joyfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God alone muſt be the fountain of all grace and peace, Becauſe he alone is the perſon offended.</hi> When we ſin, it is he that is provoked, it's his honour, and his Law that is deſpiſed; and therefore ſeeing not the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but God himſelf is chiefly offended, till he be reconciled, we cannot have any true and certain peace. That as it is with a Subject, who hath offended the Prince, it lieth in the Prince his power only to be gracious, and to give a pardon; though all men in the Nation ſhould give it him, yet if not ratified and confirmed by the Prince, whom he hath offended, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon his condition as helpleſs: Thus the foul troubled for ſin, though all the world give him peace, yet that will not ſatisfie him; his thoughts are daily, <hi>What doth the Lord ſay?</hi> Beſides theſe, as you ſee in <hi>David,</hi> though he greatly offended, and injured man, being guilty of bloud; yet he cryeth out to God, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned;</hi> and earneſtly prayeth, <hi>God would not hide his face from him,</hi> Pſal. 51.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Direction, To all contrite broken hearts, who like that woman trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the bloudy flux, have ſpent all they had upon Phyſicians that could do no good.</hi> Thou haſt thus many years been bowed down, a ſtranger to all joy and peace, look up to God more, know he alone can give thee true joy. For this reaſon we ſee <hi>David</hi> and others, ſtill making their addreſſes to God, <hi>That he would make the bones that were broken to rejoyce,</hi> that he would make the <hi>parched wilderneſſe</hi> to be like a <hi>pleaſant ſpring,</hi> for otherwiſe they are undone and miſerable, till he looks upon them. Now then, if God be the only cauſe of thy peace; take heed how thou provokeſt him; better of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all the world than God. For the world, though it rage and perſecute thee, yet cannot deprive thee of this peace; but God hideth his face in a moment, and then thou muſt needs be troubled. Therefore do not think to get this grace and peace from thy own works and doings, but imitate <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He would hear what the Lord will ſpeak,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. <hi>for he will ſpeak peace to his people.</hi> Thus we are to be attending more to the voice of God in his Word, by his promiſes ſpeaking to our comfort, then to our own hearts; thou wilt hear what thy own perplexed heart ſpeaks, or what the Devil ſpeaks, which alwayes ſuggeſt matter of terrour and diffidence, and doeſt not hearken to what God by his Spirit through his Word ſpeaketh to thee. Only take the caution along with thee, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> giveth, <hi>If God have ſpoken peace, take heed of returning to folly.</hi> Sin may in that particular be well called <hi>folly,</hi> for thereby we unſettle our ſouls; we that had the quiet enjoyments of God, and his imbracements of grace, for ſome ſin that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth or tickleth but for a moment, do caſt our ſelves into darkneſs and miſery. So that then ſin is eſpecially <hi>folly,</hi> when we have once experimentally taſted the good grace of God, and then afterwards voluntarily chaſe it away by our own careleſneſs. Oh how long mayeſt thou with tears and cries pray for light and comfort again ere thou canſt enjoy it?</p>
               <p>In the next place, God is here deſcribed relatively, <hi>a Father.</hi> The word <hi>Father</hi> is ſometimes taken <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as it denoteth God the Creatour and Governour of all things; ſometimes <hi>relatively,</hi> as denoting the <hi>firſt Perſon</hi> in the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Although the <hi>Socinian</hi> flight this diſtinction, denying the <hi>Sonne</hi> to be called the <hi>Father,</hi> unleſs once, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. which they would wreſt to another ſenſe, and that the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> is never called <hi>Father;</hi> yea, that the <hi>Father</hi> is never called <hi>Father</hi> in reſpect of the firſt creation of all things;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48709:73"/>
but becauſe of his fatherly love and care to the things created; yet theſe things might be cleared againſt them, were it in our way ſo much. Here indeed <hi>God the Father</hi> is named <hi>relatively,</hi> and not ſo much from the firſt creation, and making of all things; as from the Covenant of grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by through Chriſt we are made his ſonnes, and what Chriſt hath by nature, we have by grace. So that the paternal relation here mentioned, is more peculiar and ſweet, than that general one to all the creatures, even wicked men, who yet are preſerved by him, and like <hi>Iſhmael</hi> have many gifts, though they have not with <hi>Iſaac</hi> the inheritance. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is a Father in a more peculiar and ſpecial manner to thoſe that do</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a more peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to thoſe that believe.</note> 
                  <hi>truly believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poet ſaid, <hi>We were Gods offspring,</hi> who knew not the grace of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, yet the Apoſtle confirmeth that ſpeech, <hi>becauſe we are all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> but the <hi>good Angels,</hi> and <hi>good men,</hi> are the <hi>ſons of God</hi> in a more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared reſpect.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not inſiſt long neither upon this, though the Scripture make it the treaſury of all our conſolation; only we may briefly conſider, <hi>What it is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">what it is for God to be our Father.</note> 
                  <hi>to be our Father.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It implieth his ſpiritual begetting us by the Word.</hi> For before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion the Devil is our Father, we may ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in Hell,</hi> if we were to pray to him; as our <hi>Saviour</hi> told the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but <hi>the Devil was their Father,</hi> and all, becauſe we have his likeneſs upon us, and his works we do. But when God by his Spirit doth change us, and make us to partake of his Divine Nature, then we are ſons, <hi>Sonnes by Adoption,</hi> and <hi>ſonnes by Regeneration.</hi> It is not then every one, that God is thus a Father to, he muſt have the Image of God, and his likeneſs. Therefore though many call him Father, yet he is a Judge, and an enemy to them, becauſe they are contrary to him in nature and actions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As God is thus a Father in respect of a metaphorical generation; ſo alſo in regard of all his paternal love and care to thoſe that are his.</hi> No bowels of father or mother are comparable to his. Therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> makes his love to tranſcend <hi>the mothers love,</hi> and that to her ſucking infant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 50. Inſomuch that all our doubts and fears may preſently be ſubdued, if we conſider <hi>he is a Father.</hi> Why art thou ſo diſquieted, as if like <hi>Melchizedech</hi> thou were without father and mother? Thou art afraid of hell and condemnation, but will a <hi>Father</hi> do thus? Again, thou doubteſt about many earthly and ſenſible comforts, what thou ſhalt eat or drink, and doth not our Saviour ſay, <hi>Matth. 6. 8. Your Father knoweth what ye have need of?</hi> Improve then the relation of a Father; think what care, love and bowels God hath put into thy heart who art a father to thy children; thou never doubteſt of thy affections to them, but many times of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and dutifulneſs to thee; And is not this fatherly affection much more in God?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He is not only our Father, but he ſendeth his Spirit into our hearts, to aſſure us of this, and to be more affected with it,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. Gal. 4. 6. For whereas in nature, there the child by a natural inſtinct is carried out to his father, and to call upon him; It is not thus in grace, for when God is become our Father, then we need the Spirit of God to aſſure us of this, to make us believe it; of our ſelves we ſhould rather conclude, he is our enemy, and our Judge; but this Spirit of God putteth a filial confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence into us. Again, it doth not only aſſure us, but inableth us againſt all thoſe doubts and jealouſies we have to the contrary, to cry <hi>Father,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48709:73"/>
that denoteth the ſoul is in a very great agony, many objections and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions it hath; but yet we are enabled againſt our hearts, and againſt the Devils temptations thus to do:</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>He is a Father, and therefore doth afflict us, and chaſtiſe us for our good.</hi> Inſomuch that it is from his fatherly love to afflict us, as well as to give us of his mercies; and if as the Apoſtle urgeth, <hi>Heb. 12. 9. We reverenced our fathers after the fleſh, when they chaſtized us, how much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Father after the Spirit?</hi> which cannot miſcarry, or erre in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions upon us.</p>
               <p>To this Doctrine let us adde the Extenſion of it, <hi>Our Father. Paul</hi> ſaith not <hi>my Father,</hi> or <hi>the father of Abraham,</hi> and ſuch eminent Saints, but <hi>our Father.</hi> Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God is a Father to the meaneſt and weakeſt believer, as well as the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the weakeſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as well as the ſtrongeſt.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtrongeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence our Saviour taught all the godly to ſay, <hi>Our Father.</hi> In this expreſſion is implied:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Appropriation and application.</hi> It is not enough to acknowledge God a <hi>Father,</hi> but we muſt bring this relation home to our hearts, <hi>Our Father, my Father,</hi> and <hi>thy Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It implieth, <hi>That God is ſo the Father of one believer, that he is the Father of all the reſt.</hi> Earthly parents have ſometimes ſo many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they cannot provide for all (at leaſt) ſo liberally, but God can do as much for any one child of his, as if he had no more; his riches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is given to every one, <hi>All his children are heirs,</hi> and have as much as if there had been but one child.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is implied the unity and agreement of all believers amongst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themſelves.</hi> They have <hi>one Father.</hi> why then ſhould there be ſuch diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt them? The Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 6. urgeth this <hi>one God, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all, one Lord, one Spirit, one God and Father.</hi> Theſe are brought as arguments of unity, not meerly becauſe they are one, but one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o believers. All believers have but <hi>one Lord, one Spirit, one God,</hi> and therefore are to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt this unity.</p>

               <p>WE are arrived now to the laſt particular in this verſe, and that is the ſecond Principle or Cauſe of this <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> prayed for, which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> is here conjoyned with <hi>God the Father,</hi> in beſtowing of theſe ſpiritual mercies.</p>
               <p>In the words therefore we have the Deſcription of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Chriſt to be prayed to for grace and peace,</note>

               <p>Both which we have already conſidered in the former verſe. There remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore the <hi>Relation</hi> by which he is repreſented to us, and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Lord. Paul</hi> here prayeth for <hi>Grace and Peace from Chriſt our Lord,</hi> as well as <hi>from the Father,</hi> which is a ſure and ſtrong argument of the Divine Nature of Chriſt; for it is God alone that can give theſe ſpiritual mercies, if Chriſt were not truly God, he could not give theſe divine priviledges. And hence alſo it followeth, That it's our duty to pray to Chriſt, ſeeing he is the Author of ſuch mercies. The blaſphemous <hi>Hereticks</hi> of late have differed among themſelves, <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Davidis</hi> about praying to Chriſt. The later denying it lawfull to call upon Chriſt in prayer. The other granting in the New Teſtament examples of it; as when <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is lawfull; but yet he ſaith, <hi>There is no precept to command it.</hi> But no wonder at this, ſeeing he holdeth, <hi>That prayer in the general was never a duty command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old Teſtament.</hi> We ſee by this Text, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the <hi>fountain of grace and peace,</hi> as <hi>God the Father</hi> is, then are we to pray to one, as well as the other, or to the <hi>Father in the Name of Chriſt.</hi> The heretical exception againſt this place is, That becauſe the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not in the original, therefore he would have the word <hi>Father</hi> relate to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well as to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Our;</hi> as if the ſenſe were, <hi>From God our Father, and the Father of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Indeed our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth ſay, <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father,</hi> John 20. 17. But then he ſaith, <hi>my Father</hi> in the firſt place, whereas here in the Text, it's ſaid, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and afterwards in the heretical opinion ſhould follow, <hi>The Father of Chriſt;</hi> but that Chriſt in theſe ſalutations is meant as a conjoyned cauſe is very evident, <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. where the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is expreſſed from the <hi>Father,</hi> and from the <hi>Lord Chriſt, the Sonne of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond cavil that needeth a vindication, may be, in that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Lord,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from God: Therefore it may be thought, that Chriſt is not God. To this it's anſwered, That it's true, in the New Teſtament, though Chriſt be ſometimes called <hi>God,</hi> yet the more common title given to him, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48709:74"/>
eſpecially when <hi>God the Father,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> are mentioned together, but as when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>Lord,</hi> it doth not exclude <hi>God the Father</hi> from being the <hi>Lord</hi> alſo: So neither when God the Father is called <hi>God,</hi> doth it exclude <hi>Chriſt</hi> from being God. But you may ſay, <hi>Why doth the Scripture, if Chriſt be God, and the fountain of grace, as well as God the Father, alwayes put Chriſt after God?</hi> The anſwer is, That though abſolutely as <hi>God</hi> there be an equality, yet when perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conſidered, ſo that divine order is attended unto, whereby the Father is of himſelf alone, but the Sonne of the Father, eſpecially if we conſider Chriſt as Mediatour: ſo although <hi>God,</hi> yet becauſe in that work he is <hi>God-man,</hi> and in that office inferiour to the Father; hence it is that the Scripture ſpeaks of him as the fountain, and Chriſt as the ſtream, or rather ſecond fountain; <hi>That of God are all things, and by Chriſt are all things.</hi> It is good to underſtand theſe myſteries, ſo farre as the Scripture is a guide to us, that we be not involved in thoſe damnable <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines which overthrow theſe fundamentals.</p>
               <p>That which I ſhall obſerve is from the relation attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Lord,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is a Lord.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jeſus Chriſt is a Lord.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus he is often called in the Scripture; yea <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 16. he is ſaid to have on his thigh this name, <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi> So 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 15. The bleſſed and only Potentate; the King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi> It's obſerved, that theſe titles were given to the <hi>Perſian Monarchs,</hi> becauſe of their tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent dominion; but here it is applied to Chriſt tranſcendently, even to them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for he is ſaid to be <hi>the only Potentate,</hi> as if none were Lord but him. Hence it is noted of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as a providential thing, That the year Chriſt was born in, he refuſed to be called <hi>Dominus;</hi> and ſo ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> great men, would not be called <hi>Domini,</hi> but <hi>Domini</hi> diminitively, out of reverence to Chriſt; but the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo <hi>Lord</hi> may be attributed to men, as well as King, and head, ſo that ſtill it be acknowledged, he is <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> and that none is Lord like him.</p>
               <p>But let us briefly open this Doctrine, that thereby our hearts may be more raiſed up with this greatneſs of Chriſt; for he is a Lord not only for his own great dominion and glory; but for the believers good and benefit; it is matter both of great comfort and encouragement, to know that Chriſt is Lord. And.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are to conſider, <hi>That Chriſt hath a two-fold Lordſhip, Kingdom or Dominion;</hi> The one Divines call <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Eſſential;</hi> The other <hi>Dispenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> and <hi>Mediatory.</hi> The former he hath as <hi>God,</hi> and ſo is <hi>Lord</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, that the Father is <hi>Lord.</hi> The ſecond he hath as he is <hi>Mediator, God-man;</hi> and therefore it is in ſome reſpects diſtinct from the former, God the Father is not Lord in that peculiar and proper reſpect, as Chriſt is. For although that be true, which Divines ſay, <hi>That Chriſts natural or eſſential Kingdom, doth virtually and eminently contain all that his Mediatory doth, yet there is ſome formal respect to be made.</hi> Now as Chriſts former Lordſhip and Dominion was natural and neceſſary, ſo this may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be given him; or as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Act. 2. 36. He was made by the Father both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> appointed to be the Lord, and the Head of his Church: Not that this doth any wayes evacuate his Divine Nature; as if becauſe he were made Lord, that therefore he was not ſo eſſentially, for nothing was given Chriſt to perfect him; what he received of his Father in time, did only manifeſt that he was God: for none can be Lord and Head of his Church, but he who is truly <hi>God.</hi> If therefore as he is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it be ſaid to be given him to be <hi>Lord,</hi> and to <hi>have a Name above all Names,</hi> yet this doth not deny but prove his Divine Nature, becauſe none but God can have ſuch power, and do ſuch things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This Official, or Mediatory Kingdom hath its degrees;</hi> it is <hi>militant

and triumphant. Militant,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> hath not as yet <hi>ſubdued all his enemies under his feet;</hi> it doth not follow, that Chriſt is not Lord, becauſe every thing is not wholly conquered, becauſe there is ſinne and the Devil work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill. For as <hi>David</hi> was King, although ſtill there was a great part to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by him; he was King at <hi>Hebron,</hi> when he was not made King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet he had a right to all, before he was in actual poſſeſſion: So it is with our <hi>Lord Chriſt, he is made Lord over all,</hi> only there is time required, <hi>to bring all things in ſubjection to him.</hi> And as for his <hi>Triumphant</hi> and <hi>conſummate Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> that will be at the Day of Judgement; when having ſaved all his people, and overcome all their enemies, then he ſhall take the triumph of all his victories. And here we may take notice how to underſtand that difficult place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, 25. where Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>After all enemies are ſubdued, to deliver up his Kingdom to the Father.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> urge that, to ſhew that his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Kingdom will be but for a ſeaſon, whereas the Scripture in many other places, maketh <hi>his Kingdom to be without end,</hi> Luk. 1. 32, 33. To reconcile this therefore you muſt know, That the Apoſtle doth there ſpeak of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> as it is <hi>militant,</hi> and in reſpect of that Dominion and Government, which now Chriſt uſeth in his Church, not in reſpect of the <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> it ſelf, Chriſt ſhall never ceaſe to be the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of his people; only that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Government, which now Chriſt exerciſeth ſhall ceaſe, all Ordinances and adminiſtrations, the Miniſtry and Sacraments, yea all Magiſtracy and Civil Power, that God might be <hi>all in all;</hi> fot then we ſhall not mediately by Chriſt approach unto God, as we do here, but immediately, yet ſo as all glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will redound to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt was thus a Lord in the ſtate of his humiliation, even in his very Infancy; as well as after his exaltation and reſurrection.</hi> And here again the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> blaſpheme, denying, <hi>That Chriſt was thus a Lord till his reſurrection.</hi> But although indeed the Scripture doth often attribute this glory and great name to him after his ſufferings, and upon his reſurrection; yet that is not becauſe he was not ſo before, but partly becauſe then there was a glorious manifeſtation of his Dominion. The Sunne did not appear ſo admirable in his eclipſe: Chriſt in the ſtate of his humiliation did not ſo fully and palpably diſcover this his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet for all that he was endowed with it; and Chriſt doth acknowledg him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>have a Kingdom</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> even before his ſufferings: Yea at his birth, the <hi>Wiſemen came to worſhip him as Lord and King;</hi> and when he rode in triumph in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that Prophecy was fulfilled, <hi>Behold thy King cometh to thee.</hi> And certainly if then he was a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> he muſt needs be alſo <hi>Lord and King.</hi> Yea, in the greateſt expreſſions of his humane weakneſſes, as in his birth and death, there was alſo powerfull demonſtrations of his Divine Majeſty. Neither is <hi>Vorſtius</hi> his Objection of any value, That becauſe Chriſt in his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had not that wiſdom required to govern, which afterwards he did grow up into, therefore he could not be Lord: For in Chriſt, while an Infant, were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the treaſures of all wiſdom, though theſe were not actually to be put forth, but when there was an occaſion to do ſo. There was no defect in Chriſt to be Head of his Church, while a child, becauſe even then he could put forth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was required at that time to govern the Church with. And indeed to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that he was not <hi>Lordor King,</hi> becauſe he did not actually put forth himſelf in that way, is abſurd; for <hi>kingly or lordly</hi> actions did not make him to be a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> but becauſe he was <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> therefore he did as he pleaſed put forth ſuch actions. Certainly the Apoſtle cals him the <hi>Lord of glory,</hi> even while <hi>they crucified him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 8. And the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves acknowledge him upon his aſcenſion to be <hi>Lord of glory,</hi> when yet the greateſt inſtance of his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power is ſtill to be accompliſhed, which is the judging of all mankind, at that dreadfull Day of Judgment. Chriſt then was always <hi>Lord,</hi> both in his ſtate of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi> and alſo of his <hi>exaltation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:48709:75"/>
Fourthly, <hi>This lordly power which Chriſt hath, extends to all things in the world, he is Lord over the whole world.</hi> He is the univerſal Monarch; for <hi>God hath given him all the kingdoms of the world,</hi> Rev. 11. 15. The kingdoms of this world are there ſaid to <hi>become the Lords, and of his Chriſt:</hi> Yea in ſome ſenſe this great Dominion is given to every Saint, <hi>Revel. 2. 26. To have power over all Nations, even as he hath received of the Father.</hi> Hence it is ſaid, <hi>John 5. 22. That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Sonne;</hi> not that the Father hath wholly abdicated himſelf from the government of the world, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay, but becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi> is ſubordinate unto him in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Chriſt therefore hath an univerſal power over the whole world; And whereas learned men ſay, <hi>One man cannot be univerſal Governour over the whole world, much leſſe over the Church, becauſe no man can have thoſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fit for to diſcharge that Government:</hi> yet in Chriſt this doth not hold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is God as well as man; but this Dominion of Chriſt, in reſpect of his Church, is of another nature than that of the world, for he rules the world with <hi>a rod of iron,</hi> breaking every thing to pieces that ſhall prejudice his Church: So that this power over them is wholly coactive, as they do not willingly own or ſubmit to him as a Lord; ſo he doth by his omnipotent power keep them under, and makes them ſervants and vaſſals for his work, and to bring about ſuch glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends, which they never intended, or ſhall have any benefit by, as thoſe that built <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark, were not preſerved in it. But to his Church, there he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out a <hi>Scepter of grace.</hi> For as they do willingly own him as their King, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to his order and laws; ſo he taketh ſpecial care over them, and they may more ſafely lay themſelves down under his protection, than under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Potentate in the world.</p>
               <p>More might be ſaid Doctrinally about this Dominion of Chriſt; but let us conſider what comfortable and uſefull improvement is to be made of it. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Is Chriſt thus a Lord, and that above all Lords?</hi> Then what ground is here for our <hi>faith under all diſcouragements and affections?</hi> How little doeſt thou poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thy heart with this <hi>Lord of glory?</hi> Doeſt thou doubt about the pardon of ſinne, conquering of corruptions, preſervation under temptations?

Eſpecially this ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in any work for him. Thou feareſt the frowns of man, the oppoſitions of man; thou doubteſt thy cauſe will ſink, and is not all this, becauſe thou look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt upon earthly power as greater than Chriſts power?

               <p>So that this Text doth repreſent God in a moſt ſweet, comfortable and raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relation to us. The Apoſtle ſtands (as it were) here upon Mount <hi>Geriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim,</hi> to bleſs the people of God, we may here ſtand and ſee (as it were) the glory of God paſſe by. It is not the God of all vengeance and fury; It's not the God terrible in his judgements, that will not in any wiſe acquit the guilty, but the <hi>Father of mercies, and the God of all conſolation.</hi> Let then the troubled and grieved ſoul, who looketh alwayes upon God as angry, as ready to deſtroy, bring with the widow its cruiſes, and fill them with the pleaſant oil, that will runne out of this Text. Certainly, if <hi>David</hi> ſay of Gods word in general, <hi>That it's ſweeter than the honey or the honey-comb,</hi> much more is it applicable to this verſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the <hi>Praiſe it ſelf,</hi> in thoſe words, <hi>Bleſſed be God. Paul,</hi> you heard, begins moſt of his Epiſtles in this manner, and ſome have thought that all our prayers ſhould begin with thankſgiving, becauſe the heart is hereby
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48709:76"/>
raiſed up ſooner to Heaven. The conſideration of Gods love being like the fire that will put the ſoul into ſweet diſtillations. But certainly the method of prayer, whether with confeſſion firſt, or thankſgiving, is not commanded, but left arbitrary: Only this the ſoul muſt remember, to be as diligent and carefull in praiſing of God, as praying to God.</p>
               <p>To open the word, the Scripture ſpeaks of a three-fold Bleſſing: <note place="margin">Of a threefold bleſſing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Gods bleſſing of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>our bleſſing of God.</hi> And theſe differ exceedingly. For God bleſſeth us efficiently by exhibiting his mercies to us. We bleſs God, not by adding any good to him, but declaratively only. Gods <hi>benedicere</hi> is <hi>benefacere,</hi> his words are works: but our bleſſing (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> on the place) is only <hi>recognoſcitium,</hi> and <hi>expreſſivum, an acknowledgment only, and celebration of that goodneſs which God hath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is mans bleſſing of man;</hi> and that is two-fold, either <hi>Charitativè, Matth.</hi> 5. 44. which is to be done to our very enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129. 8. Thus <hi>Job</hi> 31. 20. ſpeaketh of it by way of comfort, that the poor whom he had refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bleſſed him. Or <hi>Poteſtativè,</hi> and that is, when Parents and Miniſters, ſuch as are in Office and Power, do bleſs their Inferiours; and this God doth more ſolemnly ratifie and confirm. Thus the Prieſts, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 23, 24. were in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner to bleſs the people; and in this ſenſe the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>The leſs is bleſſed of the better,</hi> Heb. 7. 7. And becauſe by bleſſing the greatneſs of a thing is ſet forth; hence it is uſed ſometimes for conſecrating, 1 <hi>Sam. 9. 13.

But come we to the Obſervation, which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That to bleſs and praiſe God for all his mercies, is a duty that the people of God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans duty to be much in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God.</note> 
                  <hi>ought to be carefull and diligent in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This cordial, hearty bleſſing of God is greatly neglected; ſome are borne down with the ſenſe of their ſins and unworthineſs: Some are greatly bowed down under the ſeveral afflictions God exerciſeth them with: Others are devoured with the worldly cares and diſcontents of their ſoul. So that it is a very rare thing to meet with a Chriſtian that walks with ſuch a chearfull, humble and thankfull ſpirit, that he ſtudieth all the mercies of God to him, and is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any fragment ſhould periſh. As Flies ſtick always upon the rugged parts of the glaſs, and fall from that which is ſmooth. Thus even Gods own children, if they have any affliction, if they want but one mercy they would have, this doth more trouble and torture them, than the thouſand mercies they have from God, do
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48709:77"/>
refreſh and revive them. That therefore we may make conſcience of this duty, and be much in, that we may, as the Apoſtle enjoyneth, <hi>Col. 3. 17. In all things, whether in word or deed, be giving thanks to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us conſider how much goeth to make a thankfull ſpirit; what will enable <note place="margin">What goeth to the making up a thankfull ſpirit.</note> us, that we ſhall not alwayes lie among the tombs (as it were) affright our ſelves with our own ſad thoughts, but entertain comfortable and thankfull thoughts, which ſhall conſtantly lodge in our ſouls. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, To this duty of bleſſing of God, there is required, as the foundation ſtone, <hi>A deep ſenſe of our own unworthineſs of the leaſt mercy that God bestoweth upon us.</hi> That is excellent of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 10. <hi>I am leſſe than all thy mercies.</hi> A man that would ſhoot his arrow high, draweth it backward firſt. The lower we are in our own eyes, the more unworthy in our own thoughts; then a very crum of bread, a very drop of water will be acknowledged a great mercy. <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrins do all hinder a man in his thankfulneſs, becauſe they do not in a Scripture way, level the mountains of our hearts; they leave ſomething of our own ſtill, that we muſt ſecretly uphold our ſelves with. When God gave the people of <hi>Iſrael, Canaan,</hi> Deut. 9 4. How zealouſly doth <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> endeavour to take them off from their own righteouſneſs? They muſt take heed, that they have not the leaſt thought in their hearts about their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Oh then conſider, what is that <hi>Locuſt</hi> and <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> which devoureth all the ſweet fruit of thy praiſe, and thy joy in God? Is it not want of a true conſideration, how unworthy thou art? Wouldſt thou not call thy ſelf beaſt for murmuring and grieving under any burden God layeth upon thee, if thou hadſt a feeling of thy meanneſs and lowlineſs? Thoſe therefore who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in a tender feeling and apprehenſion of their own unworthineſs, if God give them the leaſt temporal mercy, but eſpecially if they have a drop of any ſpiritual mercy; that the light of Gods countenance, though but in glimpſes ſhine upon them, they cry out, Who am I Lord, and what am I that thou ſhouldſt viſit ſo unworthy a wretch?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He muſt not only be ſenſible of his unworthineſs, who would affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bleſs God at all times, but he muſt alſo conſider what wrath and vengeance he doth deſerve.</hi> Oh this would be like fire in thy boſom! This would quickly caſt out all thoſe troubleſom and diſquiet thoughts: What, Oh my ſoul, art thou diſquieted for want of this or that! What is thy own, but hell and eternal torment? Are any ſoul-mercies, are any body-mercies thy own? Canſt thou claim a right to them? No, the Law curſeth thee, becauſe thou doeſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in all things commanded; ſo that thou mayeſt be curſed in ſoul, in body, at home and abroad. Nothing but temporal, ſpiritual and eternal curſes might compaſs thee about. Now then, if when God might thus curſe, and damn thee, he doth bleſs and pardon thee; What joyfull ſongs ſhould this fill thy heart, and mouth with? I have deſerved death, but behold life: my merit is hell and damnation, but the gift of God is grace and peace. As a malefactor, when thou mightſt juſtly expect puniſhment, behold God doth to thee as to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who under expectation of puniſhment is raiſed up to the higheſt honour in the Kings Court. Oh then, awe thy ſoul, ſaying, Why am I ſo fooliſh and bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſh? I am not in hell, I am not howling in thoſe eternal flames, which I might not be kept a moment from; and yet how impatient and unquiet is my heart? A full perſwaſion then of what we deſerve, will provoke the ſoul to a cordial bleſſing of God for every mercy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is required the regeneration and renovation of the whole man.</hi> As a wicked man cannot pray to God, ſo neither can he praiſe God. Therefore though natural men may have it often in their mouths; they bleſs their good God, and I praiſe my God; yet to <hi>praiſe God</hi> requireth a principle of grace within, a ſupernatural root, as well as to pray to God.

ſing Pſalms, and give praiſe to God, even as they pray; but all this while, there is nothing at the root, all is dead within, <hi>Pſal. 147. 1. Praiſe is comely for the upright.</hi> It's a comely ſutable thing for a man of an upright and gracious heart, to bleſs God; but for a carnal prophane man, it is as unſeemly, as a pearl on the ſwines noſe; God is diſhonoured, and not pleaſed: Oh then, that this might awaken every natural man! Thou canſt neither pray to God, or praiſe him: Thou canſt neither receive gifts from God aright, or return praiſe to him aright. So that this muſt be looked to, as the principal and chief of all. Hath God put his own image into me? Hath God beſtowed the life of grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me? Then <hi>praiſe is ſeemly and comely</hi> for me. Even amongſt men the Rule is, <hi>Laudari à laudat is laudabile eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>To bleſs God and praiſe him, there is required an heavenly raiſed frame of ſoul.</hi> For though the principle of Regeneration be the foundation in every one, whereby he is enabled to <hi>bleſſe God;</hi> yet that is more remote, and habitually only. Hence it is that many of Gods children, though in a ſtate of grace, yet are not in a praiſing, thankfull temper; they are as ſo many clods of earth; they are not affected with Gods goodneſs; their ſouls are not enlarged, and therefore they mourn, becauſe they are ſuch blocks and lumps of earth. Therefore beſides the fundamental principle of Regeneration, there muſt be proxim and immediate diſpoſitions, which are as the whetting of the tool; like the Cocks ſtirring of himſelf, and clapping of his wings before he croweth: and of all diſpoſitions an heavenly heart is the moſt excellent. Why is it that in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the glorified Saints do ſpend all eternity in bleſſing and glorifying of God, and are never weary of it? Is it not becauſe all is made perfectly heavenly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them? If the earth, though a dull and heavy element be at laſt tranſmuted into air or fire, it loſeth it's former gravity and dulneſs, and aſcends upwards. Thus the ſoul when freed from the clogs and burdens of the earth, doth with more eaſe and ſpeed lift up it ſelf to God. The Lark all the while ſhe ſits on the ground, ſcarce ſings, but when ſhe riſeth from the Earth, and the higher and higher ſtill ſhe flieth, the more ſweetly and earneſtly doth ſhe ſing: Thus it is neceſſary, if thou wilt really and daily bleſs and praiſe God, then raiſe thy ſelf above the Earth. The nearer to Heaven thy heart comes, the ſweeter will thy meditations be, the more joyfull will thy thoughts be. Hence</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Joy and gladneſſe of heart is required to bleſſe God.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> often calls <hi>to ſing with joy.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle; Is any man merry, let him ſing Pſalms?</hi> Jam. 5. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they ſay, cometh of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: That heart which is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with grief and ſorrow, is in no diſpoſition to bleſs God. As the ſtrings of muſical Inſtruments, while wet and moiſt, are not prepared to make any melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſound. To bleſs God with an heavy heart; to praiſe God with a troubled diſquieted ſoul, is to contradict with our hearts, what we ſay with our mouths. Conſider then, that though it be thy duty to humble thy ſelf for ſinne, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and bewail thy iniquities, yet it is alſo a duty, <hi>To rejoyce in the Lord alwayes;</hi> and till the heart be fitted by this joy, thou canſt nor bleſs God with that hearty affection as thou oughtſt to do, <hi>Pſal. 103. David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all within thee praiſe his holy Name. All within thee]</hi> You ſee, to praiſe God is heart-work, as well as lip-work, all within us muſt move and be affected. Thy heart cannot boil over, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſometimes expreſſeth it, unleſs this fire of joy doth inflame it. Oh then know, that a grieving, diſquieted ſoul cannot bleſs God, it hinders you from that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the Apoſtle preſſeth, <hi>Col. 3. 16. Admoniſhing one another in Pſalms and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts.</hi> What an Heaven is ſuch an heart, where there are theſe ſpiritual hymns and pſalms? But alas how oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en is thy heart like an howling wilderneſs, where the cries and dolefull ſounds of unbelieving and diſtruſtfull fears do torment thee?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:48709:78"/>
Sixthly, <hi>To bleſſe God there is required faith, and a reſting of the ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, as a reconciled Father.</hi> Alas can the damned in hell bleſs God? Could <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> bleſs God? By no means, becauſe there is no faith, there is no reſting upon God as a Father. Hence you ſee, the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>The Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Father of all mercies.</hi> To curſed and condemned ſinners God is not a Father of mercies, but of vengeance and fury, a God of dreadfull judgments, who is ſaid to be <hi>angry with the wicked all the day long.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> doth ſo often in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> exerciſe thoſe appropriating, and applying acts of faith, <hi>My God, and my Tower, my ſtrong help and defence.</hi> It was his faith that made him ſo thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For what is it to hear of Chriſt, and all ſpiritual mercies by him, if faith doth not apply them, and make them my own? And then we are ſtirred up to give God thanks for them, inſomuch that faith hath the greateſt influence into our thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Faith of adherence is not enough to make the heart ſo throughly and affectionately thankefull as it ſhould be, unleſſe alſo there be</hi> (as ſome call it) <hi>faith of evidence, or a good and true perſwaſion that God is our God.</hi> It's the reflecting acts of the ſoul, whereby it knoweth, and is aſſured, that God hath pardoned my ſinne, and hath forgiveth my iniquities, that are like oil to the lamp of this duty. <hi>David</hi> in ſome <hi>Pſalms</hi> dependeth upon God, and ſo many times the choiſeſt of Gods ſervants, they are ſupported to reſt on him, to build their hopes on Chriſt; but then wanting this aſſurance, not feeling this love of God ſhed abroad in their ſouls; hence they are not fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and zealous in theſe duties of bleſſing and thankſgiving, as they ought to be. Do you not ſee many of Gods people more forward to duties of humiliation and mourning, more attending to ſelf-debaſement and ſelf-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency, then they are to faith, joy and bleſſing of God; the one they are conſtantly in; the other, unleſs provoked and forced (as it were) they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom accompliſh. Now this ought not to be ſo; we are to <hi>rejoyce</hi> as well as <hi>tremble;</hi> we are to put both together; we are to bleſs God for pardon of ſinne, as well as confeſs ſinne; we are to rejoyce in giving of thanks, as well as to humble our ſouls in acknowledging of our ſinfulneſs. Thou oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſaiſt, Lord pity me, Lord ſhew mercy to me; but how ſeldom doſt thou ſay, O Lord, I bleſs thee, <hi>For thy mercy endureth for ever!</hi> My heart hath been full of ſorrow for ſinne, and now it is full of joy for the pardon of it. I have prayed that my corruptions may be ſubdued, and I bleſs God that prayer is graciouſly anſwered. If you winne a mercy by prayer, and do not wear it by praiſe, you greatly offend God.</p>

               <p>FRom the method that <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth here, and in the beginning of moſt of his other Epiſtles, we have obſerved the Duty that lieth upon all the people of God, to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carefull and conſcientious in this duty of <hi>bleſſing and praiſing of God,</hi> which is as the legal ointment for the High-prieſt, compounded of choice and ſweet ingredients.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>The heart that is duly fitted to praiſe God, though it be thankefull for every mercy, even the leaſt mercy, yet it keeps an order in its thankeſgiving according to the dignity of its objects;</hi> ſo that it praiſeth God chiefly and principally for <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mercies;</hi> and then ſecondarily, for <hi>temporal mercies.</hi> And this argueth the difficulty of this duty, and that alſo only the regenerate and ſpiritual man can in a Scripture-way <hi>bleſſe God,</hi> for he only doth preferre heavenly things above earthly. When the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had ſpoken of outward mercies to a people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. 12, 13, 15. great mercies in ſons and daughters, rich abundance and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he corrects all at laſt, <hi>Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe, yea happy is that people, whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> So that you ſee all the outward deſirable mercies that are, are but in a ſubordination to Gods favour. When thou art breaking forth after this manner, I bleſs God for my children, for my health, for my outward contents. Oh but above all, Lord, that I have any ſpiritual mercy, that thou haſt loved my ſoul, converted me to thy ſelf, ſaved me from the evil wayes of the world, in this my ſoul is overwhelmed! So then, as we ſee it is in matter of <hi>Petition, Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Thus it is alſo in <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever heavenly mercy God hath beſtowed on thee, bleſs God for that in the firſt place. Thus the Apoſtle doth praiſe God in a moſt divine manner, <hi>Eph. 1. 3. Bleſſed be God, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt.</hi> Inſomuch that this may be a good Touchſtone of the truth of grace in thee, whether thy ſoul be moſt affected and enlarged towards God for ſoul-mercies, that thou canſt truly ſay; O Lord in that thou haſt made me in a ſaving manner to know thee, in that thou haſt revealed thy Son to me, I do more rejoyce in this, and bleſs thee for it, then if thou hadſt given me all the glory of the world! Doeſt thou ſee a natural worldly man boaſt in his riches, in his birth, in his greatneſs above others, and knoweth nothing at all of Gods favour and ſpiritual mercy to his ſoul? This is like a beaſt that is crowned with Garlands, but yet prepared for the ſlaughter. Canſt thou ſay, O Lord, I judge all the outward mercies I have to be but husks, and empty ſhels, in compariſon of that <hi>Manna,</hi> that <hi>ſpiritual favour</hi> I am made partaker of. As therefore the ſpiritual man, when in outward miſeries and ſtraights is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48709:79"/>
not ſo much grieved under thoſe outward calamities, as becauſe he hath ſinned, and God is offended: So neither in outward mercies is the ſame gracious ſoul, ſo much affected with the comforts it enjoyeth, as that the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth ſhine upon him, that he hath an evidence of propriety and intereſt in Chriſt, this he would not loſe for all the Kingdoms of the world. Let us preſs this the more, becauſe even the moſt holy are apt to be affected more with ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mercies than ſpiritual; <hi>Nature</hi> teacheth them the one, but <hi>Grace</hi> the other. For as we are apt to deſire temporal things above ſpiritual, ſo alſo to be affected with, and bleſs God for one more than another.</p>
               <p>But take theſe few Motives to provoke thee <hi>to bleſs God</hi> for <hi>ſpiritual mercies,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Motives to be more affected with ſpiritnal mercies than temporal.</note> which are of two ſorts, <hi>External,</hi> as the means of grace, and the Ordinances; or <hi>Internal,</hi> the inward ſanctification and juſtification of our perſons. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That if thou hadſt more mercies than</hi> Solomon, <hi>if thou hadſt all thy ſoul can deſire in theſe outward things, yet if without ſpiritual mercies thou judgeſt thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is curſed, and to be lamented.</hi> Therefore <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. when the natural perſons of the world cried out, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good? David,</hi> as knowing a better and more ſolid good, prayeth, <hi>God would lift up the light of his countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him:</hi> And therefore he that hath the leaſt drop of grace, is more bound to bleſs God, then he that may have all the glory and plenty in the world: Oh then, why art thou not more ſollicitous, ſaying, what is this wealth without Gods favor? What is it to ſay, this houſe is mine, this eſtate is mine, but am not able to ſay, <hi>God is mine?</hi> but if God doth evidence himſelf to thee, then over-look all thy outward comforts, put the <hi>Ecce,</hi> the <hi>Selah,</hi> upon what is ſpiritual. This is like the Sunne, which is farre above all the Starres. It is this that makes all outward mercies, mercies; they are no wayes good to thee, but ſnares and temptations to draw out thy ſins. So that thy condemnation in hell will be the hotter, if thou doeſt not enjoy ſpiritual mercies with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be in the firſt place affected with ſpiritual mercies, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt ſhewed his love to thee moſt in theſe, it was for theſe he died.</hi> The Scripture doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly commend to us the love of Chriſt in his death. Now what are the effects of Chriſts death? Are they chiefly to make us rich, great or honoured in this world? No, it is for remiſſion of ſinne, it's for holineſs and power over the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Certainly, if Chriſt died to purchaſe theſe for thee, thou art very unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if thy heart be not moſt inlarged to bleſs God for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Spiritual mercies are the chiefeſt object of our praiſes, <hi>Becauſe theſe onely can truly ſatisfie the ſoul, theſe only are a ſound cauſe of rejoycing.</hi> The heart of a man is never ſatisfied with temporal mercies; but the more he drinketh of them, the more thirſty ſtill he is. When <hi>Solomon</hi> hath made an experience of all, his <hi>Motto</hi> is, <hi>That they are vexation of ſpirit,</hi> as well as <hi>vanity;</hi> whereas the pardon of ſinne, and the Spirit of Chriſt working in us, theſe afford uninterrupted cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of joy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſoul-mercies will abide for ever, thou canſt not loſe thy title and intereſt in them; but all theſe earthly comforts are as the flower which preſently withereth; thou haſt them to day, and they may be removed to morrow.</hi> Be ſure then, that thy bleſſing of God, keepeth that method which the nature of mercies doth require above all things. Let thy ſoul melt with joy in bleſſing of God, for what he hath done to thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Conſideration, remembring, and fixed meditation upon the mercies of God, is that which will greatly inflame the ſoul to give all glory and honour to him.</hi> The heart is not eaſily and quickly put into a bleſſing frame; there muſt be poliſhing and faſhioning of it; and there is no ſuch way for this, as true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. When <hi>David</hi> calls upon himſelf ſo much to glorifie God, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, that he found his ſoul dull, heavy and unfit for that duty. The heart will not boil over in meditation, unleſs it be long upon this fire. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 1.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48709:79"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> there calls his <hi>inditing, the boyling or bubling of his heart;</hi> we are apt to forget Gods mercies, or when we do think of them, they are but tranſistory and ambulatory, <hi>It is Gods goodneſſe,</hi> or <hi>I bleſs God,</hi> and there is all; whereas when we bleſs God, our ſouls ſhould be raiſed up into divine inflammations; we ſhould be as <hi>Elijah,</hi> who was carried up to Heaven in a Chariot of fire; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſoul is at other times <hi>abridged</hi> or <hi>epitomized,</hi> but in ſhort characters, in the praiſes of God it ſhould be <hi>voluminous,</hi> as you ſee <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalms</hi> 103, 104, 105, 106, and 107. very large in the enumeration of all Gods benefits, which intimateth, That the ſoul ought to be extended in all its dimenſions, while it ſets upon this work. And certainly, meditation is like the birds ſitting on the egge, not leaving it, till it hath produced a live young one. This will ſo often work upon the ſoul, that at laſt there will be heavenly and ſupernatural life; for ſeveral aggravations will the meditating heart find in every bleſſing it doth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It will admire the power and ſtrength of God in every mercy, especially in ſoul-mercies;</hi> That God ſhould change ſuch a ſtubborn heart as thine was; That God ſhould give thee eyes to ſee, that haſt been blind ſo long; That God ſhould give thee life, who waſt dead and putrifying in the grave of ſinne. This will make thee wonder at the glorious power of God.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>The Wiſdome of God, if that be conſidered in every mercy, this will alſo greatly inlarge to thankefulneſſe.</hi> Gods mercies are not only mercies in themſelves, but they come in ſuch fit ſeaſons, they are at ſuch times and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, that this maketh them double mercies; and ſo ſome have obſerved this difference between <hi>bleſſing</hi> and <hi>praiſing of God; Bleſſing of God is, becauſe of the goodneſſe of the mercy; Praiſing is for the wiſdome and curious workmanſhip of God, as it were in that mercy.</hi> As if a friend, who alſo was himſelf the maker of a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Watch, ſhould beſtow it upon you as a gift, you would not only thank him for his love, but praiſe his skill and art likewiſe. Thus we are not only to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mercies God giveth us, but the wiſdome that God demonſtrateth at that very time, making every mercy to be with an aggravation.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Meditation will inflame, by apprehending of Gods freeneſſe in every mercy, and our unworthineſſe.</hi> We could do nothing, that may provoke God; eſpecially this we are to aggravate in our ſpiritual mercies, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth often, excluding our works, and giving all to the grace of God, who worketh accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own purpoſe and will. Oh what coals of fire will this be in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome! To think, why doth God do this to me? What moveth him? Is God neceſſitated to it? Can he not do otherwiſe? Would he be unjuſt, if he did it not? And this further will be aggravated, when we conſider the mercy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively with others that want ſuch; if for ſpiritual mercies, we compare them with the <hi>damned Angels,</hi> that are utterly cut off from the leaſt crum of any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mercy, though ſo noble and excellent creatures, may not this aſtoniſh thee? And if thou ſayeſt, Theſe are not of the ſame nature with thee; How many are there of the ſame fleſh and bloud, in the ſame vicinity where thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, of the fame calling and profeſſion, yea of the ſame parentage, and yet they are forſaken by God, and left to their natural deſerts, whereas he hath pitched his favour upon thee, to <hi>juſtifie, ſanctifie,</hi> and at laſt to <hi>glorifie thee?</hi> Certainly, thou art a ſtock and a ſtone, if ſuch diſcriminating mercy as this doth not affectionately poſſeſs thee.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, <hi>The univerſality of the mercies thou enjoyeſt, will much heighten in the conſideration of them.</hi> All that thou ſeeſt, thou heareſt, thou eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thou feeleſt, yea thou thinkeſt and apprehendeſt, is a mercy. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within thee, without thee, or about thee, but it is a mercy. To hear is a mercy, to ſee is a mercy, to think without madneſs and diſtraction, is a mercy. Every thing that is not hell, is a mercy to thee. All the creatures, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48709:80"/>
the <hi>Sunne,</hi> the <hi>Sturres,</hi> the <hi>beaſts of the field</hi> are wholly mercies; if then a man ſet himſelf to meditation after this manner will he not find the goodneſs of God, like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> waters, <hi>To aſcend higher and higher, till they come over his head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to finiſh at laſt this Subject, take notice of the encouragements to this duty of a thankful, bleſſing and praiſing ſoul, that ſo if thy heart at laſt be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed up to this duty, thou mayeſt praiſe God, for this truth that provoketh thee to praiſe him. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The more thou bleſſeſt God, the more wilt thou have cauſe to bleſſe him.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Motives to bleſs God for all his mercies</note> For to the thankfull heart, God multiplieth his mercies, as many times, becauſe thou doeſt not take notice of his goodneſs to thee, or lookeſt upon his mercies as a debt to thee, or thou takeſt the mercies God hath given thee; and uſeſt them as weapons againſt him, therefore he taketh away thy mercies from thee, to make thee prize them the more; whereas to the ſoul that taketh every mercy, as the hen, every drop of water, and immediately looks up to Heaven, that will take up every fragment, that nothing be loſt: As thou bleſſeſt God declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, God will bleſs thee really: Chriſt will bleſs thee, as he did thoſe few loaves by multiplying of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider this is all thou canſt do to God, for all his ſeveral mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> What doth God require of thee, after all that he hath done for thy ſoul and body? Is it any thing elſe, but to magnifie his name, to give him the glory of it? And this doth not at all adde unto the greatneſs of God, he is not made the more perfect and bleſſed in himſelf by all the glory thou giveſt to him. So that indeed it is the greateſt glory that thou art capable of, that God will accept of bleſſing from thee, that he will own praiſes out of thy mouth, that he doth not rebuke thee, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did the <hi>Devils,</hi> when they confeſſed, <hi>He was the Son of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This bleſſing and praiſing of God, will keep thee in a joyfull, active, and fruitfull way.</hi> Thoſe that ſing at their work, diſpatch it with greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility: And thus it is, the ſoul filled with cordial thankfulneſs to God, doth more for God then many others, who are clogged with dejecting and diſcouraging thoughts: See whether the cauſe of all thy heavineſs, yea the prevailing of luſts and paſſions upon thee be not want of chearfull bleſſing of God, <hi>The joy of the Lord is our ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Conſider the example of David,</hi> how unwearied he is in this work, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinking that his ſoul doth enough herein; and therefore becauſe he cannot diſcharge this duty to his deſire, he calls upon all the creatures of the world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to help him therein, yea the very <hi>Ice</hi> and <hi>Snow,</hi> and ſuch inanimate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; how much more <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> muſt joyn with him to praiſe God.

               <p>The firſt is, <hi>From a perſonal and relative respect, The Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; Even the Father]</hi>

                  </gap>. That particle is by way of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and explication. What he meaneth by <hi>God,</hi> viz. That he doth not take the word, as it is often, abſolutely for the eſſence of the Divine Nature, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the three Perſons; but relatively, and in the diſtinct perſonality of the firſt Perſon, and therefore ſaid to be, <hi>The Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Stephanus</hi> obſerveth, may be rendred by <hi>Et, ſed, tunc, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> &amp;c. as the ſubject matter requireth. The Apoſtle doth in other places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to uſe this expreſſion, <hi>Rom. 15. 6. 2 Cor. 11. 31. Epheſ.</hi> 3. 14. In which places the Apoſtle ſeemeth with much affection and cordial enlargement to make mention of this relative Title in <hi>God the Father;</hi> for this is the treaſure of our comfort; herein are all our mercies contained, that we and Chriſt have the ſame <hi>Father,</hi> he by <hi>Nature,</hi> and we by <hi>Grace.</hi> So that we are not to conſider of Gods paternal relation to Chriſt, as a ſpeculative doctrinal truth, but as pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, and the ground of all conſolation to us. Hence <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. Chriſt by way of comfort tells them, <hi>He aſcends to his Father, and their Father.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without Chriſt we cannot behold him as a <hi>Father,</hi> but as a ſevere and dreadfull Judge. Only when we ſay, this Doctrine of the <hi>Fathers</hi> relation to Chriſt a Sonne, is ſo full of comfort, you muſt not underſtand it abſolutely and nakedly, as the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, but as aſſuming the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into a Perſonal Subſiſtency; Therefore he ſaith, <hi>The Father of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is the deſcription of his Perſon in both his Natures. So that we muſt not look upon the Sonne as the ſecond Perſon alone in the Trinity, but as aſſuming our Nature; for otherwiſe the truth would be no wayes comfortable to us, if the Sonne of God had not alſo been made man. The Obſervation ſhall be the words in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Which truth ſhall be firſt explicated, and confirmed <hi>Doctrinally,</hi> and then il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated <hi>Practically.</hi> As for the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part, the <hi>Socinians</hi> they have raiſed up much duſt, and have obſcured the point, with their ſubtill heretical deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48709:81"/>
For whereas the Church of God formerly did believe <hi>Chriſt to be the Son of the Father by eternal generation:</hi> They deny this reaſon, and aſſert ſome new ones of their own invention. Yea, and the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> alſo, though they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert <hi>Chriſts Sonſhip from the Father by eternal generation,</hi> yet they affirm alſo a ſecond way of communication of this <hi>Sonſhip,</hi> and that is, <hi>By a gracious vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing of ſupream power and glory to him.</hi> So that they muſt acknowledge <hi>two fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations</hi> in Chriſt, the one <hi>Eternal,</hi> by that ſecret and ineffable generation; the other <hi>Temporal,</hi> or <hi>in time,</hi> viz. <hi>A gracious communication of ſupream power and glory to him.</hi> But this is falſe, as is to be ſhewed. But to explain this, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the Scripture we read of four ways, whereby a perſon may be entituled <note place="margin">Propoſitions explaining, how Chriſt is the Son of God.</note> to be the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and to have <hi>God his Father.</hi> (For as for that more common and general notion, whereby God is ſaid to be a <hi>Father</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Creation,</hi> and ſo to all men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 8. And the Apoſtle ſanctifieth that expreſſion of the Poet, <hi>For we are his off spring,</hi> we do not here meddle with.) And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a Sonne of God by Creation after the Image of God.</hi> Thus <hi>Adam, Luk. 3. ult.</hi> is called, <hi>The Sonne of God,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> alſo, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6. Theſe are the <hi>Sonnes of God,</hi> and have him for a <hi>Father,</hi> becauſe they they were at firſt created after his Image in holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God is a Father by gracious Adoption.</hi> Thus all believers have received <hi>The Spirit of Adoption,</hi> being thereby enabled to call God, <hi>Abba Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A Perſon is ſaid to be the Sonne of God, by communication of ſome power and office.</hi> Thus our Saviour argued from the leſſe to the greater, That if they were gods, to whom the word of God came, <hi>viz.</hi> who were appointed by God to be Magiſtrates, how much more was he God?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is the Son of God by eternal generation, and thus Chriſt is onely.</hi> Hence he is called, <hi>His only Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Take notice, <hi>That Chriſt is called the Sonne of God, only from one respect, and that is becauſe of eternal generation from the Father.</hi> It is not my purpoſe to enter into a Diſpute about this ſecret and unſpeakable myſtery. This is enough for us to know, That Chriſt is never called the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> or God ſaid to be <hi>his Father,</hi> but becauſe of that eternal generation, as the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. from <hi>Pſal. 27. Thou art my Sonne, This day have I begotten thee,</hi> which is ſo attributed to Chriſt, that thereby he hath a ſupereminency to all the Angels, who yet are called the <hi>Sonnes of God,</hi> upon a gracious foundation. Hence</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is not called, <hi>The Sonne of God, becauſe he is predeſtinated to be the Mediator of his people,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 20. For he is not therefore the <hi>Son of God,</hi> becauſe fore-ordained to be Head of his Church; but this latter doth preſuppoſe, and is grounded upon the former, becauſe he was the ſecond Perſon in <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Son of the Father,</hi> therefore was he ordained thus to be a <hi>Mediator</hi> for his people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt is not called the <hi>Sonne of God, becauſe of his Incarnation, or that wonderfull manner of the production of his Humane Nature in the womb.</hi> Indeed ſome orthodox <hi>Divines,</hi> and ſo <hi>Maldonate</hi> the <hi>Papiſt</hi> do grant, That Chriſt was called the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> becauſe of that extraordinary conception, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 32, 35. for the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſeemeth to favour ſuch an interpretation, becauſe when the <hi>Angel</hi> had ſaid, <hi>The holy Ghoſt ſhould overſhadow the Virgin Mary,</hi> he preſently addeth, <hi>Therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> Now though theſe men hold Chriſt was called thus, the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> becauſe of that extraordinary and peculiar way of the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Humane Nature, yet they acknowledge his <hi>Sonſhip</hi> by <hi>eternal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> alſo. But it is well obſerved by other learned men, That it is an impudent conceſſion to the adverſaries of Chriſts Divine Nature, to grant Chriſt is ever
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48709:81"/>
called the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> but becauſe of <hi>eternal generation.</hi> And therefore that expreſſion, <hi>Therefore alſo,</hi> &amp;c.] is not an argument from the Cauſe, but the Sign: That extraordinary conception was not a Cauſe, but a true and ſure Sign, that he was the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>He ſhall be called,</hi> not be <hi>the Sonne of God,</hi> which relateth to the manifeſtation and notification of it. And no doubt the <hi>Angel</hi> doth allude the ninth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where a <hi>Virgins</hi> bringing forth a <hi>Sonne,</hi> is made a Sign of his being <hi>Emmanuel, God with us.</hi> For if this extraordinary conception had been a cauſe of this filiation, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he called, <hi>The Sonne of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> then of <hi>God the Father,</hi> becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conceived by him. Neither is that of <hi>Maldonate</hi> true, excepting againſt this interpretation, <hi>That a pure man might have been ſo conceived by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and it would not follow that he was God properly.</hi> For beſides that, it is a bold aſſertion to ſay ſo, we muſt take this extraordinary conception in its circumſtances, as it was fo promiſed by the Prophet, and thus it could not agree to any but to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Neither is Chriſt called the Son of God, becauſe of his ſanctification and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the word,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 10. 35. Nor</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Becauſe of his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> His eduction from the earth, as it were a womb to life, being like a new birth. Nor</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Becauſe of his being placed at the right hand of God,</hi> Heb. 1. 4. For although in thoſe Texts, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is proved to be the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> by his <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Miſſion</hi> into the world, by his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and by his <hi>Exaltation,</hi> yet not ſo as if theſe did make him to be a <hi>Sonne.</hi> So that he was not a <hi>Sonne</hi> before, but by way of declaration and manifeſtation. When theſe things were done, there was a plain diſcovery that he was the true and proper Sonne of God, he was the <hi>Sonne of God from all eternity;</hi> but none could ſo riſe, and be exalted, but he who was ſo. And therefore the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who make Chriſt the <hi>Sonne of God by degrees,</hi> by his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and firſt, and afterwards more perfectly a <hi>Son</hi> in his Exaltation, do moſt palpably wreſt the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The Summe therefore of this Diſcourſe is, That as Chriſt was called the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> only becauſe born of a woman; ſo the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> only, becauſe by <hi>eternal generation</hi> he was of the <hi>Father.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle asketh this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>To which of the Angels</hi> (then much leſs men) <hi>ſaid he, Thou art my Sonne,</hi> &amp;c? which muſt be in a peculiar tranſcendent ſenſe; for in a common general one, <hi>Angels</hi> are called the <hi>Sons of God.</hi> And indeed to be a <hi>Sonne by eternal generation,</hi> and then afterwards by <hi>gracious communication</hi> doth imply a contradiction. For amongſt men, he that is truly ſuch a mans ſonne by natural generation, can never for any adventitious reaſon, be properly called his ſonne afterwards. If then God be the Father of Chriſt by generation, then he is not by any other ſuppoſed wayes of gracious communication. And that Chriſt is a <hi>Sonne</hi> in a tranſcendent way to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>men,</hi> appeareth fully by the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 5. 8. Although he was a Son,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>yet learned obedience by thoſe things in which he ſuffered.</hi> From whence we ſay, Chriſt was a <hi>Sonne,</hi> not according to his Humane Nature, for ſo he was to ſhew obedience, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. but in that ſenſe wherein he could not obey, <hi>viz,</hi> in his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Therefore it's a diſcreet <hi>Axiom</hi> or <hi>Propoſition, Although he was a Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being laid as a foundation, let us come to conſider this as a ground of our <note place="margin">How Chriſts being the Son of God is the foundation of a Chriſtians comfort.</note> comfort. For you may ſay, Why is God to beſa bleſſed by us? Becauſe he is the <hi>Father of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For what doth that appertain to us? Indeed to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ungodly men, who periſh in their ſins, this makes no more for their comfort, then for apoſtate Angels, whoſe nature Chriſt took not upon him: But as for the godly, the true believer, this is the foundation of all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:48709:82"/>
Firſt, <hi>In that he is the Father of Chriſt, by this means he cometh to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him.</hi> For ſeeing Chriſt is ours, then he who is the Father of Chriſt muſt be our Father alſo, as will appear in the ſecond place. But the firſt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of comfort is, That Gods paternal relation to us, is grounded upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers relation to Chriſt; Chriſt merited at Gods hands, that he ſhould be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Father with us; for without Chriſt, God is not <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> but a dreadfull and terrible Judge, <hi>He is a conſuming fire,</hi> and we cannot with any confidence draw nigh to him, but through Chriſt; God aſſumeth a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us, of a Judge he becometh a Father. So that we ſee, this is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all our comfort: Therefore is God a Father to us, becauſe he is to Chriſt; and this is the reaſon, why the Apoſtle mentioneth (as you heard) this Title ſo often with <hi>Doxologie,</hi> becauſe without Chriſt, God is not a Father; We cannot expect a drop of mercy, or the leaſt glimpſe of favour from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This relation of God the Father to Chriſt, is of great comfort to us, becauſe of our union with Chriſt.</hi> When we by faith are made one with Chriſt, then we have the ſame Father as he hath; and this is a ſecond ground of our comfort. The Apoſtle calleth him, <hi>The Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>our Lord, our Jeſus,</hi> therefore <hi>God is our Father,</hi> The Devils and wicked men, becauſe they cannot truly ſay, <hi>Our Chriſt,</hi> therefore they cannot call God, <hi>Our Father.</hi> It's then our union with Chriſt, that doth entitle us to God a Father, as well as Chriſt himſelf. As it's with the wiſe, when married to an husband, then the husbands father is her father, and what relations he hath, ſhe is alſo received into. Thus it is here, when the ſoul by faith receiveth Chriſt, he is thereby made <hi>the Sonne of God, and a co-heir with Chriſt:</hi> They have now the ſame Father; Chriſt is become their brother to them: Oh what an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious priviledge is this, that Chriſt ſhould not diſdain us, or be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of us, but call us brethren, and make us to have the ſame Father with him I Did faith improve this by lively meditation, what joy and quietneſs would it produce in our hearts?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is greatly for our comfort, <hi>Becauſe though there be ſome diſtance and inequality, yet we may upon the ſame general grounds plead the bowels of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all the effects of fatherly love, as Chriſt himſelf may.</hi> Will not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny Chriſt? neither will he us. Will not the Father reject Chriſt? neither will he us; he is become a <hi>Father to us,</hi> as well as <hi>to him.</hi> Indeed there is a great diſproportion between Chriſt and us in this paternal relation; he is by <hi>Nature,</hi> we by <hi>Grace;</hi> he is the <hi>only begotten Sonne,</hi> we <hi>adopted ſons;</hi> he is <hi>perfectly holy,</hi> and the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of this relation for us. Therefore the <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrine is to be abhorred, who makes Chriſts Sonſhip, and that of believers, to differ only in degrees, not in kind. Yet in the general, becauſe by him, God is made a Father, we may improve it, in what we have his promiſe for, as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did. Hence 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14. what is ſpoken of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a type of Chriſt, and in the general is true of all believers, the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. applieth to Chriſt, as in ſuch particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The fatherly love and bowels which Chriſt found from God in all his exerciſes and agonies, the like may we expect to find.</hi> Did Chriſt ſay, when his Diſciples left him, <hi>That he ſhould not be alone, becauſe the Father was alwayes with him?</hi> The ſame may every true believer affirm, when he may be left alone; if in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, thy friends, thy acquaintances forſake thee: <hi>If father and mother</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid) <hi>ſhould leave thee,</hi> yet this <hi>Father</hi> is alwayes with thee. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou art not comparable to Chriſt, either in thy natures, perſons or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet remember the ſame fatherly love is common to both. Hence <hi>Job. 17. 23. That they may know that the love wherewith thou loveſt me, is in them. In them]</hi> by way of ſenſe and experience, by way of knowledge and certainty.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:48709:82"/>
2. <hi>As God is a Father to Chriſt thus in love, ſo alſo he was in hearing of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which he put up as man, or as Mediator. Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I know thou heareſt me alwayes,</hi> John 10. And therefore in that wonderfull prayer of his, that his ſoul poured out before his death, his compellation unto God is, <hi>Father.</hi> And thus alſo God being a <hi>Father</hi> to us, he will hear all our requeſts that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will. It is true, God the Father heareth his only begotten Sonne Chriſt, becauſe of the full and abſolute Image of himſelf in him. There is no ſinne, no blemiſh, nothing blame-worthy in Chriſt; but in us there are many imperfections: There is juſt cauſe to reject our prayers; but yet becauſe we are in Chriſt, therefore for Chriſts ſake, and in his Name they are accepted, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe perfumes their prayers. It is through Chriſts obedience, that God ſmels a ſweet ſavour in our holy performances. So that Chriſt indeed he was heard for his own ſake, and in his own Name; but we are in Chriſts Name. So that you ſee the redundancy of that paternal relation to Chriſt in his benefits even to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Other properties we might enlarge in, but it is eaſie to the good heart to ſuggeſt them to its ſelf, as the <hi>eternity,</hi> and the <hi>unchangeableneſſe of this relation to them,</hi> as it was alſo to Chriſt. Hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Chriſt being from all eternity and unchangeably fore-ordained to be their Head; they were alſo then compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that gracious Decree of God. Only this difference you muſt alwayes obſerve, That God becometh our <hi>Father</hi> otherwiſe than Chriſt; for the <hi>Father begat him from eternity,</hi> not by <hi>grace,</hi> and from his meer free-will, as if he might have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> immutability (though ſome adde, we may ſay his generation was both by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and free-will, as not being inconſiſtent with one another:) but as for us, God makes us his ſons from his meer good pleaſure; he might have refuſed to adopt any one to his Sonne; he took infinite delight in his only Sonne, which was from all eternity: So that it was the riches of his grace, and the freeneſs of his bounty to adopt us for his ſons, with Chriſt his natural Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction.</hi> Is <hi>God our Father, by being the Father of Chriſt? Doth our union with Chriſt, intitle us to that Father, and other unspeakable benefits, which he hath?</hi> Then let the Chriſtian ſoul meditate on this more. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> were the ſons of God, but that was by creation; God is thy Father up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more certain and enduring ground, which is union with Chriſt. What ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are you to your own peace and grace, while you look upon your ſelves as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from Chriſt? If the wife make her ſelf a diſtinct perſon from her husband, ſhe hath no benefit by the Law, ſhe cannot recover any advantages, but all muſt be done in her husbands name, and in his title. Thus it ſhould be with thee; pray in Chriſts name, comfort thy ſelf in Chriſt, meditate upon God in Chriſt. The time is coming, when Chriſt only will be in requeſt, when at the day of Judgement, the voice ſhall be, <hi>Go ye curſed,</hi> becauſe <hi>not in Chriſt; Depart into everlaſting fire,</hi> becauſe <hi>not in Chriſt.</hi> This then ſpeaketh nothing but terror to the ungodly, who are not branches in him; they cannot have the leaſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or hopefull thought of God; being not in Chriſt, they have none of Chriſts righteouſneſs.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe next conſiderable motive in God, who is thus to be bleſſed, is from his relative Attribute <hi>to us, The Father of mercies;</hi> if every mercy be a ſtream iſſuing from him the fountain; if every favour be a ray, which hath its emanation from that Sun; then no wonder if always, and in all things we are to bleſs and praiſe him. Its <hi>Bernards</hi> obſervation, he doth not ſay, <hi>Pater ultionum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Father of revenge and of judgments, which yet he is to all wicked men, but of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that is to ſuch as fear him.</hi> So that the Apoſtle doth here repreſent God, in the moſt ſweet and lovely relation that may be to the truly godly; They muſt not think fury and vengeance is in him towards them, though ſinners, but that through Chriſt all enmity is taken away, and they may with boldneſs come to him as to a Father; even as the child doth ſecurely reſt in his Fathers boſome.</p>
               <p>The words have no difficulty, they are a fountain opened, no ſtone is to be removed, that the wearied ſoul may drink thereof. Obſerve,</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>That God hath ſuch an Attribute of mercy.</hi> The Scripture doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent him <hi>Wiſe, Juſt</hi> and <hi>Almighty,</hi> but <hi>Mercifull</hi> alſo, Jam. 5. 11. God is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>He is very pitifull, and of tender mercy.</hi> The former word is from the bowels that uſe to move, when we are affected compaſſionately with any miſerable object. So that Gods <hi>mercies</hi> they are <hi>bowel-mercies,</hi> he doth not only do good to us; but to ſpeak after the manner of men, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately affected unto us, while he doth ſo. Hence <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 78. they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>The bowles of mercy:</hi> But whether <hi>mercy</hi> may be attributed to God properly, is diſputed, The <hi>Socinians</hi> they deny <hi>mercy</hi> to be an eſſential property to God, even as they do <hi>vindicative Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> they denied <hi>mercy</hi> to their wiſe man. <hi>Seneca</hi> grants <hi>clementia</hi> and <hi>benignitas,</hi> but not <hi>miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> for they defined <hi>mercy</hi> to be <hi>egritudo animi,</hi> a <hi>ſickneſs and grief of the mind,

which ariſeth from anothers miſery:</hi> And why is it called <hi>miſericordia,</hi> Yarch <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> but becauſe it doth make <hi>miſerum cor.</hi> Therefore if we ſtick to theſe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of mercy, as it is in man, who hath <hi>compaſſion,</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>paſſion,</hi> we are not to attribute it to God, but ſeclude all humane imperfections, and look upon it as an Attribute in God, <hi>whereby he doth will to help and relieve ſuch as are in miſery, ſo it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ivently in him;</hi> and as there is <hi>none good but God,</hi> ſo we may ſay, there is <hi>none mercifull but God.</hi> The <hi>mercy</hi> then of God is infinite, as his own nature, and do has rarre tranſcend all our ſins and miſeries, as the Heavens do a mole-hill, only there is not perturbation in the holy Nature of God, which we find in our compaſſions. <hi>Anſelme</hi> expreſſeth it well, Thou art mercifull, O God, <hi>Secundum nos, non ſecundum te, ſecundum ſenſum noſtrum non tuum, cum tu respicis nos miſeros, nos ſentimus miſerationis effectum, tu non miſeriae affectum.</hi> God then is mercifull, as well as juſt, and thouſands of places in the Scripture ſpeak of this <hi>mercy</hi> of God very largely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is good to know, that the <hi>mercy of God</hi> is taken in Scripture ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Actively,</hi> for that eſſential Attribute in him, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. where the Lord himſelf proclaimed his own Name, <hi>Mercifull, Grucious. Long-ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> Though <hi>Divines</hi> do give notional differences between his <hi>Goodneſs, Mercy, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> yet I ſhall not attend to that. Or <hi>Paſſively,</hi> for the effects of his mercy, as here in the Text, <hi>The Father of mercies;</hi> ſo when God doth threaten to take away his mercies, that is, the effects of his mercy, not the attribute of mercy. This you muſt diligently attend to, becauſe the effects of Gods mercy are more and leſs, but the attribute in God cannot be ſo, God is not more or leſs mercifull; neither doth Mercy as an attribute oppoſe Juſtice, as an attribute, but the effects of Gods Mercy may be, and are contrary to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>Gods general mercy,</hi> and <hi>his ſpecial; His ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral mercy</hi> is extended to all the creatures, <hi>The whole world is full of his mercies, Pſal.</hi> 33. 5. So his <hi>mercy</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>over all his works.</hi> Would the world ſubſiſt for a moment, when the Inhabitants thereof are ſo full of rebellion againſt God, were it not for his mercy? All that we ſee, we hear, we taſte, we feel, is nothing but mercy. His ſpecial mercy is to <hi>rational creatures, men</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> and that again is two-fold, <hi>More ſpecial,</hi> and <hi>moſt ſpecial. More ſpecial,</hi> is the vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing of the Goſpel, and means of grace, both to the wicked and the good. This Kingdom of Heaven is ſet open for both. But then there is the <hi>moſt ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and that is vouchſafed only to the elect, by which means they are converted, juſtified, and ſhall be glorified; and of this it is the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom. 9. 15. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much may ſuffice for the Doctrinal information about this truth: Let us <note place="margin">What is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> in the next place take notice, what is comprehended in this expreſſion, <hi>Father of mercies.</hi> For this is a box of ointment to be opened and beſtowed upon poor ſouls; and while this glory of God doth paſs by, we can ſee but the back parts of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When he is ſaid to be <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> this implieth, <hi>That he only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth mercies, and receiveth none.</hi> So that as the father giveth being to the child, but receiveth nothing of the child: Thus God he is <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> becauſe he is abſolutely ſufficient in himſelf; he needeth nothing from any, becauſe then there would be a ſuperiour to God. And this conſideration may greatly aggravate the glorious Nature of God in being mercifull, in that he himſelf is like the Sun giving light, but receiving none at all. We cannot ſay of <hi>Angels,</hi> they are <hi>the Fathers of mercies,</hi> becauſe though they be <hi>miniſtring ſpirits</hi> to ſerve us. An Angel was ſent to comfort Chriſt, yet they need mercy as well as we. The river needs the ſpring, but the ſpring is the laſt, and needeth not the river; and ſo Angels and men they need mercy every way, but God he needeth none, only he
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48709:84"/>
is the giver of all, <hi>It being more bleſſed to give than to receive,</hi> even in this ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he is called <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> it implieth, <hi>The volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs and readineſs in God to it.</hi> Pſal. 103. <hi>Like as a father pitieth his children,</hi> &amp;c. We do not intreat or hire a father to pity a miſerable child, his own bowels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to it. Now this is much more in God. For as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> argueth, <hi>He that made the eye, ſhall not he ſee?</hi> So he that giveth bowels and pity to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſhall not he much rather be mercifull? So that as it is for holineſs; if all the holineſs of men and Angels were put together, it would be but a drop to what is in God: So if all the mercy, and all the compaſſions of all the fathers and mothers in the world were joyned together, it would be nothing to God. Oh what diſhonour doth thy unbelieving fearfull heart do to this mercifull Father! Thou thinkeſt he hath but the mercy of a man; thou judgeſt of his bowels ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy own; no Gods mercie is as much above thy ſinnes and miſeries, as his Eſſence is above thy being. <hi>O nomen (miſericordia) ſub quo nemini desperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi> But of that more preſently. Only when he is called <hi>a Father of mercies,</hi> that denoteth the readineſs in God, and willingneſs in him; and this is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Gods <hi>mercies,</hi> over what is in mans; our <hi>mercy</hi> is many times, becauſe the object miſerable, is of our own fleſh, and nature with us. It moveth the heart to ſee one of the ſame nature with us to be thus miſerable, but God he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly above man, he hath no communion in nature with us, and yet he is merciful. Again, <hi>Mercy</hi> amongſt men is often, becauſe we have been under ſuch miſeries our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves. They that have the pain of the ſtone, commiſerate thoſe that are in the like manner troubled, becauſe they know what it is. Thus many eminent Miniſters of the Goſpel, are exerciſed with ſoul-temptations and deſertions, that they may know how to mourn with bleeding bowels over thoſe that are ſo tempted. Thus the mercy of Chriſt as Mediator, differs from the mercy of God, as abſolutely conſidered. For he was <hi>tempted like us in all things, ſinne only excepted,</hi> Heb. 4. 15. and the reaſon of this the Apoſtle giveth, <hi>That he might be touched with a feeling of our infirmities.</hi> Chriſt knoweth what the meaning is of every groan, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſigh that comes from a child in darkneſs, crying out, <hi>Why hath my God forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> Thus Chriſt as <hi>Mediator is mercifull</hi> in another way, then God is; yet this advanceth ſtill the mercy of God, that whereas his bleſſed and perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot know experimentally what it is to be miſerable, what it is to need mercy, yet for all that his breaſts are full. and no womon is in greater pain to be eaſed of her burden, then God to beſtow his mercies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>In that he is a Father of mercies, a Father,</hi> there is implied, <hi>That he doth lay our miſery to heart.</hi> For although he cannot be paſſionately affected, as man, nor is ſenſible of our infirmities, as Chriſt was, yet this doth not hinder, but that our miſery is taken notice of, as really ſo, as to be ſuccoured by him, as if it were in the moſt compaſſionate Father that is. That expreſſion of God concerning the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> miſeries under bondage is remarkable, <hi>Exod. 2. 24, 25. He heard their groaning, he remembred his Covenant, he looked upon his children, he had respect or knew them.</hi> See here ears, eyes, memory and mind, all are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with their trouble. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9. it is ſaid, <hi>In all their afflictions, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</hi> As then anger againſt wicked men, though in God it be not the ebulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bloud about the heart, or accompanied with a pale countenance, yet it is more really, and dreadfull in God than in man. Therefore better have all the men of the world angry with thee than God. So it is in his mercy, in him mercy, though it have not humane concomitants, yet it's more real, operative and efficacious, than all the mercifull fathers in the world is; and thou hadſt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have God ſhew mercy to thee, than all the men of the world. For</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, when he is ſaid to be <hi>the Father of mercies,</hi> there is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>The real and lively working of it.</hi> The father though he pity his child, yet cannot give him the <hi>mercy</hi> of health, much leſs the <hi>mercy</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> Miniſters,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48709:84"/>
though they be <hi>ſpiritual Fathers,</hi> they can only pray for <hi>mercy,</hi> preach of <hi>mercy,</hi> but to give you pardon of ſinne, to give you comfort of conſcience, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that they cannot do; but God is the <hi>Father of theſe mercies,</hi> he can give joy to the ſoul, and neither Devil or ſinne can diſcomfort. As the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came out of the womb of nothing at firſt; when God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> immediately there was light; and as God is called, <hi>The Father of rain, Job</hi> 38. 28. becauſe he can open the bottles of Heaven, and refreſh the parched earth when he pleaſeth; ſo alſo he is the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> becauſe he can turn thy darkneſs into light, thy hell into Heaven; yea he doth it, that ſo what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons, many Ordinances could not do, that God ſuddenly and inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doth, he comforts irreſiſtibly, as well as converts irreſiſtibly. But of this more in the next property, <hi>viz. A God of all conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>In that he is the Father of mercies,</hi> there is implied, <hi>That it's onely from himſelf that he pitieth us, that he hath ſomething within him to provoke to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, when we have enough to provoke him.</hi> And this is repreſented in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Parable of the <hi>Prodigal ſonne</hi> returning to his Father; Though there was cauſe enough from the ſonne, to alienate the Father to upbraid him with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality and rebellion, ſaying, Whence come you? Where are all the goods I gave you? Yet for all that, <hi>The Father runneth to meet him, kiſſeth and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him,</hi> who might have chaſtized him, receiving him with as much readineſs, as if he had never been ſuch a prodigal ſonne; but what moved him all this while? The affection of a Father. It's not then for the godly ſoul to be poring and puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſelf alwayes; what is there in me, that may make God ſhew mercy to me? What have I? What find I in me, that may prevail with God? Oh fooliſh and unwiſe Chriſtian! Think rather what is in God to love thee, to pity thee. <hi>I will go to my Father,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Prodigal;</hi> Though I have loſt the obedience of a ſon, yet he hath not the bowels of a <hi>Father;</hi> the bowels of a <hi>Father</hi> are ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him again. Think what a fountain his goodneſs is, to iſſue forth rivers of mercies. So that it is with thee, as ſome parched dry wilderneſs, it hath no ſprings, no ſtreams to refreſh it ſelf with, till clouds from above fall upon it. Thus thy heart is ſcorched, and even burning like hell, till God give thee not a drop of water, but Chriſts bloud to cool thy afflicted ſoul. Thus you ſee, what is in this a <hi>Father of mercies, a Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, what briefly is in the object, <hi>a Father of mercies,</hi> in the plural number, and that implieth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no mercy, but it comes from God. Every good and perfect gift is from him,</hi> Jam. 1. For if ſo be any creature were the original of mercy, though it be but the leaſt; as to that particular, it would be <hi>the Father of mercy;</hi> if the Sunne of it ſelf were the higheſt cauſe of giving light to thee, if it were not God that did cauſe this Sunne to ſhine on thee, that Sunne would be the father of the mercy of light. Although therefore God hath appointed natural cauſes, moral cauſes, yea and ſupernatural means of mercy and comfort to thee, yet take heed of calling theſe <hi>Father.</hi> Thy food would not be a <hi>mercy</hi> to thee, thy houſe a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> no thy ſenſes, thy underſtanding would not be a <hi>mercy</hi> to thee, were it not for this <hi>Father of mercies.</hi> So that whereſoever, and whenſoever thou meeteſt with any mercy, look higher than the creature, ſee an hand from Heaven giving it thee. As <hi>Gerſon</hi> a devout Papiſt ſpeaketh of his Parents, how that they to teach him, while a child, <hi>That every mercy was from God;</hi> had a deviſe, that from the roof of the chamber ſhould be conveyed to him every apple or nut, or ſuch childiſh refreſhments, he deſired; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. when he preſſed againſt <hi>carefull, diſtruſtfull thoughts,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Your heavenly Father knoweth what you want.</hi> So that it is not thy own natural father, that is a mercy to thee, but thy Father in Heaven: As that good man in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> when they brought him news his father was dead, <hi>Define blasphemias loqui, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48709:85"/>
eminens immortalis eſt.</hi> Thus are we to call nothing a <hi>Father of mercy</hi> to us, but God himſelf. So that what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat. 23. 9. Call no man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on earth,</hi> in reſpect of faith and obedience; neither are we in reſpect of our mercies. Oh but how difficult is it not to have other <hi>fathers of mercies</hi> beſides him!</p>

               <p>The ſecond thing comprized in it, is <hi>the multitude of them;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>The Father of mercy,</hi> but of <hi>mercies;</hi> it is not one or two, but <hi>mercies, many</hi>

The Lord therefore is not ſtraitned in mercy, no more than in power; but as nothing is impoſſible to him, ſo every kind of mercy is eaſily producible by him. The multitude of Gods mercies, is that which <hi>David</hi> doth often mention, <hi>Pſal. 106. 7, 45. Pſal.</hi> 51. 1. And indeed were not theſe mercies many, our ſins would be more than they, and exceed them in number. <hi>David</hi> complaineth, <hi>That his iniquities were more than the hairs of his head;</hi> and yet at another time acknowledgeth, that ſuch were the benefits of God towards him, <hi>that he is never able to reckon them up.</hi> We cannot then come and ſay to God about mercies, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did to his father about bleſſings, <hi>Haſt thou but one bleſſing, O my father?</hi> Haſt thou but one mercy? Woe would be to us, if God had not multitude of mercies, for we have multitude of ſins and miſeries. Oh then, let the broken, humble heart, who groaneth under this, that he hath many ſins, they are not one or two, but many, yea the multitudes of them, are like ſo many locuſts and caterpillars in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he cannot look this way, or that way, but ſinne doth compaſſe him about! Let ſuch remember, that there are more mercies for them, then ſins againſt them. If thou haſt multitude of ſins, God hath multitude of mercies to cover them, ſo as thou doeſt not cover them, but confeſs and bewail them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In this expreſſion of <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> is not only comprehended <note place="margin">Of the variety of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</note> 
                  <hi>the multitude of them, but the diverſity alſo, he is the Father of all kind of mercies, God hath an unexhauſted treaſure of mercy.</hi> Therefore the Scripture calls God <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 4. Though God be rich in wiſdom, in power, yet the Scripture calls him only rich in mercy, as if herein he did moſt excell. Now from this treaſury ariſe all kinds of mercies. Do not ſay, God may by his mercy help
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48709:85"/>
me in this particular, and in that reſpect, he can give me bodily <hi>mercies,</hi> but can he give ſoul <hi>mercies?</hi> He can give private <hi>mercies,</hi> but can he give publick <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</hi> Yes, we have too low and narrow thoughts of God, if we limit him to any kind of mercy, he can do the greateſt as well as the leaſt. Let us inſtance in ſome kind of <hi>mercies.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There are common mercies,</hi> and <hi>there are ſpecial mercies. Common mercies</hi> are thoſe <hi>the whole world is full of; He maketh the Sunne to ſhine upon the good and the bad.</hi> Therefore our Saviour preſſeth us, <hi>To love our enemies,</hi> becauſe God is thus <hi>mercifull</hi> even to his enemies; Is not the whole earth, every Village, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Town full of the common mercies of God? How come ſo many to live, to ſubſiſt upon his coſt and charges? Whence is it that all the people in the world are provided for? Is it not from the <hi>mercy of God?</hi> Lam. 3. 22. <hi>It's the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed;</hi> That famine, warre, plague and other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do not ſweep away all the inhabitants of the earth; That the whole world doth not fall into ruines; This is from Gods <hi>meer mercy.</hi> That all are not roaring in hell, it's the <hi>mercy of God.</hi> Now this <hi>common mercy</hi> is the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, if ye conſider what kind of perſons they are to whom he is thus <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> even to his very enemies, that hate God; and if it lay in their power, would deſtroy him, that he ſhould not have a being. Oh the mercy of God that is continued to many a prophane beaſt, and many a malicious Devil, to what is good! Why is it that every liar is not ſtricken dead with <hi>Ananias?</hi> Why is it that every drunkard quaffing in his pots, doth not ſee a terrible hand-writing in the wall againſt him? Why is it that the earth doth not open to ſwallow thee up, while thy mouth is full of curſing and ſwearing? Is not all this from the mercy of God? Oh how little doth this mercy of God lead you to repentance, whereas it is vouchſafed to you for that end! Let it not be deſpiſed, becauſe it is common. For though God be thus often <hi>mercifull,</hi> yet ſometimes his judgements are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to prophane men: They are ſuddenly deſtroyed, while they are in their drunken fits, and it is Gods <hi>mercy</hi> that what hath befallen others doth not alſo come upon thee; but after thy impenitent heart, <hi>Thou treaſureſt up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath; Now is the day of mercy,</hi> but then will be a <hi>day of wrath.</hi> There are <hi>ſpecial mercies,</hi> ſuch as the godly are only partakers of, <hi>To be called, to be juſtified, to be ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. Oh what heart or tongue can expreſs the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of thoſe, who have theſe mercies! How ſacrilegious are thoſe Doctrines, that do not make God wholly and ſolely <hi>the father of theſe mercies,</hi> but they make themſelves, and their own <hi>free-will,</hi> to be <hi>yoynt-fathers</hi> with God in theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? But as <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old urged, <hi>If I cannot make my ſelf a man, which is the leſſer, can I make my ſelf an holy man, which is the greater?</hi> If there is not the leaſt <hi>temporal mercy</hi> that thou canſt procure by thy own power, not a morſell of bread, not a drop of water, canſt thou by thy own ſtrength obtain the greateſt of all? Though it be ſaid, <hi>The ſword of the Lord, and of Gideon;</hi> yet it cannot be ſaid, the vocation, the juſtification <hi>by Paul, and by Chriſt;</hi> but Chriſt alone doth theſe things in us and for us, though by his grace we are alſo ſanctified and inabled to do that which is holy.</p>
               <p>Again, There are <hi>ſoul-mercies,</hi> and there are <hi>bodily-mercies;</hi> There are <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> and there are <hi>temporal mercies,</hi> now God is the Author of both. We may ſinne by unthankfulneſs for either of them; if thou takeſt thy bodily-mercies as due, thy health, thy ſleep, thy preſervation from daily dangers, in this thou wrongeſt the goodneſs of God; for if he take away his hand but for a moment, thou canſt not ſubſiſt. And as for <hi>ſoul-mercies,</hi> whether the <hi>natural ones</hi> of it, as thy wit, thy underſtanding, thy fancy, thy ſenſes, God is the Father of them: Or the <hi>ſpiritual ones,</hi> there he is much more; if thou haſt repentance, faith, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, a gracious contented heart in every condition, theſe are <hi>mercies of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> but God alone is the Father of them.</p>

Furthermore, <hi>There are preventing, or privative mercies,</hi> and there are <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mercies.</hi> Now the Rule is, <hi>Plures ſunt gratiae privativae quam poſitivae,</hi> more privative favours than poſitive. Did not God prevent, what innumerable evils might ariſe every day to deſtroy thee? When we pray for <hi>daily bread,</hi> in that we comprehend all kind of outward bodily mercies; ſo that if the Lords hand were not alwayes giving, we could not abide a day. Now ſeeing that by ſinne we are made obnoxious to all the curſes in the Law, <hi>To be curſed at home, and curſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</hi> How manifold are <hi>Gods preventing mercies</hi> to us? What evil might every day bring forth to thee? What a ſad night might every night be to thee, if <hi>Gods preventing mercies</hi> did not compaſs thee about?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We might inſtance in <hi>private mercies,</hi> and <hi>publick mercies.</hi> But what hath already been ſpoken, may abundantly confirm us, <hi>That God is the Father of mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us conſider the <hi>Property of Gods mercy.</hi> And <note place="margin">Of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods mercies.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He is infinite in mercy, as well as in other attributes.</hi> So that this fountain can never be drawn dry, he hath <hi>mercy</hi> enough for thee and me, and for all the humbled ſinners in the world: If all <hi>the Nations of the world are but as a drop to him,</hi> ſo neither are all the ſins of the world, but as a drop to his <hi>mercy.</hi> No ſins are too many, or too great for <hi>Gods mercy.</hi> And truly this conſideration alone, is that which doth revive and eſtabliſh the drooping ſoul; for if it were but the <hi>mercy</hi> of a creature, if it were finite mercy that thou hadſt to do with, woe and again woe would be unto thee. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks fully to this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 55. 7, 8, 9. where there is an encouragement given to the wicked, <hi>To forſake his evil wayes,</hi> becauſe <hi>God will have mercy,</hi> yea <hi>he will abundantly pardon,</hi> or <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply to pardon;</hi> and whereas the ſinner might think, Surely God will never do ſo, to ſuch an hainous and wretched ſinner as I am; the Prophet tells us, <hi>Gods thoughts are not as our thoughts, but as the Heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are his ways,</hi> viz. <hi>of mercy to our wayes.</hi> As then the earth is but like a pins head, in reſpect of the vaſt dimenſions of the Heavens; ſo are all our ſins comparatively to Gods mercy. If then thou haſt great thoughts about thy ſins, ſaying, <hi>They are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than thou canſt bear,</hi> yet have as great thoughts of Gods mercy, and know they are not greater than <hi>mercy</hi> can take away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it's <hi>infinite mercy, ſo they are tender mercies, bowels of mercies.</hi> Pſal. 40. 11. <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>God would not take away his tender mercies from him.</hi> Hence he is compared both to a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Mother.</hi> Oh take heed then of diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, by hard diſtruſtfull and unbelieving thoughts about him! Think not of him as an auſteer Judge, who reapeth where he doth not ſow. The Devil, and our guilty conſciences are apt to repreſent God otherwiſe than he is. Indeed while thou art ſecure and ſtupid in thy ſins, thou thinkeſt of God as an <hi>Idol-god,</hi> having no eyes to ſee; or thou preſents him only a <hi>mercifull God</hi> to thy ſelf, as if he were not alſo holy and juſt; but when once ſinne burneth in thy heart like fire; when God makes thee a terrour to thy ſelf, becauſe of thy wickedneſs, then all is turned; Thou thinkeſt of the juſtice and vengeance of God only, as if he had no mercy; but when thy ſins are a burden to thee, and thou doeſt in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of thy heart forſake them; then think of God only, as the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents him; then hearken what <hi>mercy,</hi> comfort and peace he ſpeaks to ſuch a contrite ſoul as thou art.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They are ſure mercies to all the godly.</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. They are called, <hi>The ſure mercies of David.</hi> For all neceſſary mercies, either for ſoul or body, they are bound up in Gods promiſe; and therefore they may well be called <hi>ſure mercies;</hi> even thoſe thou haſt not yet, are as <hi>ſure mercies,</hi> as if thou waſt already poſſeſſed of them. Glorification and ſalvation are the <hi>ſure mercies of God</hi> to thee, though for the preſent thou art in a valley of tears, ſighing under thy miſeries.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are <hi>free mercies, ſuch as God doth only for his Names ſake,</hi> when we
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48709:86"/>
have nothing but ſinne in us, that may juſtly provoke God to turn his <hi>mercies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>judgments,</hi> yet for <hi>his own ſake he will be mercifull.</hi> Though we have loſt our grace, yet he hath not <hi>that attribute of mercy.</hi> Thus <hi>Pſal. 6. 4. Pſal. 31. 16. David</hi> ſtill prayeth, <hi>Save me for thy mercies ſake;</hi> So that this may greatly encourage thee, when thou thinkeſt, Oh what a barren and dry wilderneſs am I! Oh what matter do I find in me, to diſpleaſe God for ever! In the midſt of theſe thoughts remember <hi>Gods mercies</hi> are <hi>free;</hi> They have no other original or riſe, but from himſelf. Think though I have degenerated from my holineſs, yet God can never lay aſide his <hi>mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay; <hi>Is this truth to be indifferently publiſhed to all? May we tell every one, that God is the Father of mercies to him? Will not this be to make the heart of the wicked glad, whom yet God would have made ſad?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To anſwer it therefore firſt, It cannot be denied, but <hi>that God is very mercifull even to wicked men, and that while they continue in their obſtinacy.</hi> Doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience confirm this? And this <hi>mercy of God</hi> is not only ſeen in <hi>temporal things,</hi> he giveth them health, life and wealth, ſo that they can never plead againſt God; but alſo he is <hi>mercifull</hi> to many ungodly wretches, and that in <hi>ſpiritual mercies,</hi> he giveth them the kingdom of grace, he giveth them the <hi>Miniſtry of the Gospel,</hi> he alloweth them <hi>the day of grace,</hi> whenas they might have been alwayes kept up in darkneſs. Hence it is that the Scripture doth ſo often complain of the unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, of the unthankfulneſs and forgetfulneſs towards him, even worſe than of the bruit creatures.</p>
               <p>But in the next place, <hi>There are the moſt ſpecial mercies of his complacency and delight, and theſe are vouchſafed only to true believers.</hi> So that we cannot properly ſay, <hi>God is a Father of mercies</hi> to any but to <hi>the upright in heart.</hi> For though wicked men do taſte of many <hi>mercies</hi> from God, yet he is not a <hi>reconciled Father</hi> to them; They come not from him as <hi>a Father in Chriſt;</hi> and therefore though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they may be called <hi>mercies,</hi> yet if you conſider the event of them, how the wicked abuſe all <hi>mercies,</hi> and increaſe their ſins by them, it will be at laſt confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they were not <hi>mercies,</hi> but <hi>judgements</hi> to them. The <hi>mercies</hi> then which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from Gods favour none have but thoſe that are godly; and we may in brief take theſe <hi>Characters</hi> of ſuch who are <hi>Objects of his mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such as are of a broken contrite heart for ſinne, ſuch who forſake and caſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Who are the fit objects of Gods mercies.</note> 
                  <hi>it away in their lives.</hi> To theſe only <hi>God is a Father of mercies:</hi> For as for the wicked, it's ſaid, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day.</hi> To whom doth the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, the curſe of the Law belong, but to thoſe that are thus guilty of ſin? The doubt then is not, Whether God be <hi>mercifull?</hi> but whether thou art the fit ſubject of <hi>mercy,</hi> whether thou art the man God will honour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Such only are the Objects of his mercy that have faith in him, that hope in his mercy.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> doth ſo often profeſs his <hi>truſt in Gods mercy.</hi> For there is either a <hi>phariſaical ſelf-righteouſneſs</hi> in us, whereby we are apt to truſt in our righteouſneſs, and in the works we do. We ſee by the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, and moſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> at this day, that they are ſo full of themſelves, that they never truſt alone in <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> or elſe if ſin be ſet home upon the conſcience, then many prove <hi>Cains</hi> and <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> they flie from the <hi>mercies of God in Chriſt,</hi> and damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for fear of damnation; ſo that preſumption makes moſt, and deſpair ſome few, the unfitted objects of <hi>Gods mercy;</hi> miſery alone doth not prepare thee for <hi>mercy:</hi> The Devils and damned in hell are miſerable enough, yet cannot obtain one drop of <hi>mercy;</hi> but there muſt be a debaſing of thy ſelf, becauſe of ſin, and then raiſing up of thy ſelf to catch hold on <hi>mercy.</hi>

                  <p>How God is the God of comfort, yea of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolations to all thoſe that are his.</p>
               </argument>

                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 3.</bibl>
                  <q>And the God of all comfort.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe next ground, why <hi>God is to be bleſſed,</hi> is, becauſe he is <hi>a God of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Now although this might ſeem to be the ſame with the former, when he is ſtiled <hi>the Father of mercies.</hi> Yet we may make that diſtinction, which <hi>Aquinas</hi> upon the place giveth, <hi>viz. That he is a Father of mercies, becauſe he doth either prevent, or remove thoſe miſeries, that our ſins do deſerve; but he is the God of all conſelation, in that, though our afflictions and tribulations be not taken away, yet while we are in them, he doth give many conſolations, and cauſeth much joy in the heart.</hi> God therefore is called <hi>the God of comfort,</hi> in this reſpect, that though for juſt and wiſe ends, he will not deliver his people from ſad exerciſes, yet he will in thoſe exercſes give them ſuch ſtrong cordials, and ſweet revivings, that they ſhall not only have patience to bear them, but even joy in them.</p>
               <p>So that in the words we may take notice of what he is ſaid to be, a <hi>God;</hi> and then the <hi>Extent,</hi> or <hi>Univerſality</hi> of it, a <hi>God of comfort,</hi> and a <hi>God of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is uſed ſometimes for <hi>exhortation;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for <hi>comfort;</hi> for <hi>exhortation,</hi> Act. 13. 15. Rom. 12. 8. and for <hi>comfort</hi> in many places. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3. there is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Exhortation</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> put together. Some ſay, therefore is the ſame word put for <hi>exhortation</hi> and <hi>comfort,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſpiritual conſolation</hi> is hardly received by the afflicted hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſinner; and therefore he muſt again and again be preſſed and <hi>exhorted</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it; for the <hi>Devil</hi> is <hi>the prince of darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>father of terrors</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> and ſo immediately oppoſite to this glorious Attribute in God, <hi>The God of all comfort.</hi> The <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> from this word is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Comforter.</hi> So that although by way of oeconomy it is attributed to him in an appropriated man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet that doth not exclude the Father. For <hi>opera ad extra ſunt indiviſa,</hi> but (as was formerly ſaid) this fountain doth not need any ſtone to be removed from it, and therefore we may immediately drink of it. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is a God of all comfort to ſuch as are his.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle is not content to call him only the <hi>Father of mercies;</hi> but as a further aggravation of his goodneſs, repreſents him to us, as a <hi>God of all conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> For though he be a <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> yet becauſe a <hi>Father,</hi> he doth chaſten and correct us; it is neceſſary therefore that under thoſe corrections, we ſhould be ſupported by heavenly conſolations from him, <hi>Rom. 15. 5. Paul</hi> doth in that place alſo ſtyle him, <hi>The God of patience and conſolation;</hi> the God that giveth us to be patient and lowly under his hand. For who is not furious and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48709:87"/>
againſt God under chaſtiſements, if God give not a meek and patient ſpirit? But that is not all, he is alſo a <hi>God of conſolation,</hi> that is more than <hi>patience;</hi> he <hi>giveth ſongs in the night; he turneth our water into wine; Though tears may be for a night, yet joy cometh in the morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us conſider, how much is comprehended in this expreſſion, <hi>The God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>God is the God of comfort.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of all conſolation,</hi> wherein every word hath ſome emphaſis. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In that he is ſaid to be a God of comfort, a God,</hi> that intimateth theſe things to us:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That he hath a ſupream power, and independent Dominion and Sovereignty over us, whereby he diſtributeth comfort, when, where, and to whom he pleaſeth.</hi> For in being a <hi>God</hi> of it, that ſuppoſeth all <hi>comfort</hi> is at his command; he makes it go where he goeth, and he taketh it away where he pleaſeth. Hence we read in Scripture a <hi>cup of conſolation,</hi> Jer. 16. 7. and a <hi>cup of ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 116. 3. and <hi>Pſal. 23. 5. David</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>his cup running over,</hi> that is, <hi>a cup of gladnes and joy.</hi> Now why is it called a <hi>Cup? Expoſitors</hi> ſay, It's an alluſion to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a feaſt amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe cuſtome was to aſſign the <hi>Cup</hi> of praiſe, and thanks to thoſe who were to drink of it. In that then it is called the <hi>Cup of gladneſſe,</hi> that ſuppoſeth it to be a <hi>cup in Gods hand,</hi> who is the chief governour of the world, and that he giveth thoſe to drink, whom he approveth of. Even as the Scripture ſpeaks alſo of a <hi>Cup of aſtoniſhment, a cup of anger and fury in his hand, which he will make nations to drink off whether they will or no,</hi> Jer. 25. 28. God then hath a cup of joy in his hand, and he giveth his people to drink of it, when he pleaſeth; we cannot have joy and comfort when we pleaſe. The godly afflicted ſoul would give a world for comfort in his heart, but he cannot procure a drop to his own ſoul by his own power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He is a God of conſolation, and that ſuppoſeth him to be alone the efficient cauſe of it.</hi> That if we would have our ſad and darkned hearts filled with joy, it is <hi>God</hi> alone that can do it: So that as he is called, <hi>The God of all grace,</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>grace,</hi> whether <hi>outward</hi> or <hi>inherent</hi> that we are made partakers of; but it cometh alone, and freely from God the fountain: So is he alſo <hi>the God of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> becauſe it's he alone that worketh this comfort in us. The leaſt affliction, the leaſt ſinne in its guilt, would be enough to overwhelm us, did not God come in with comfort. <hi>David</hi> under the ſenſe of Gods wrath for his ſins, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of his broken bones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. doth earneſtly pray to God, <hi>To reſtore joy to him again.</hi> Alas he was never able to bring joy more into his ſoul: But as when the Sun is ſet, all the men in the world cannot make it riſe again, it would be perpetual night, if God did not make the Sunne to ariſe. So the godly heart humbled for ſinne, would find continual blackneſs and horrour, would be in a perpetual hell, if God did not create light in that ſoul. Hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. Joy is made <hi>the fruit of the Spirit,</hi> becauſe it's the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> that can only <hi>comfort</hi> the heart truly. Indeed there is much carnal and worldly joy, that men may for a while ſport themſelves with, but this is no true enduring comfort; It is but a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,</hi> a <hi>dream,</hi> a <hi>blaze,</hi> like the tickling upon a ſcratch, that leaveth more ſmart afterwards. He is therefore a <hi>God of conſolation,</hi> becauſe God only can vouchſafe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He is the God of comfort, becauſe whom he will comfort, ſhall be comforted.</hi> As he makes men drink the <hi>cup of his anger,</hi> whether they will or no, ſo even thoſe humbled ſouls, who with frowardneſs and unbelief ſet themſelves againſt <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;</hi> they do with <hi>Rachel refuſe all comfort,</hi> yet God doth wonderfully bring <hi>comfort</hi> into their hearts. How ſubtil and reſolute are ſometimes Gods own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, while in darkneſs, to argue againſt, and reſuſe the comfort, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel bring to them; They will not let the good <hi>Samaritans</hi> pour oyl into their wounds. But when God cometh with comfort, then theſe boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous winds and waves will preſently be ſilent. Hence <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4. acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48709:88"/>
                  <hi>God had put more comfort in his heart, then they had in the abundance of all earthly joy.</hi> God did put it into his heart, even with a kind of holy irreſiſtible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; when he comforts, neither ſinne, or the Law, or the Devil can diſcomfort. Inſomuch that it's great matter of praiſe to God, when the ſoul hath been at the very borders of hell, and hath been ready to be ſwallowed up with overmuch grief, that then, even then God hath cauſed joy to ariſe in the ſoul, ſo that all his doubts, all his darkneſs, they are diſpelled; and as the Church ſaid, <hi>When their captivity was turned as the ſtreams in the South, they were like men in a dream.</hi> Thus are they even aſtoniſhed to ſee what a wonderfull alteration God hath made upon them, turning a barren wilderneſs into a pleaſant pool. Thus God <hi>comforts,</hi> as he teacheth; none teacheth like him; for he doth not only reveal the object to be known, but prepareth and fitteth the ſubject to underſtand: whereas man teacheth only by propounding Truths, but cannot give a mind to underſtand. Thus God alſo <hi>comforteth,</hi> as no friend can, no Miniſter can, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God doth perſwade the heart; he can take away the fears and the doubts, and ſo make all comfort to have an immediate illapſe into the ſoul: whereas even the Miniſters of the Goſpel, though they bring <hi>the glad tidings of peace; Though they have the tongue of the learned to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the afflicted ſoul,</hi> yet they can bring this no further than into the ear, they cannot make it at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the heart; inſomuch that Miniſters <hi>comfort</hi> in vain, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they ſeal <hi>comfort</hi> in vain, till God do alter and change the heart. And thus much is conſiderable, becauſe it's ſaid, <hi>The God of conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What is implied in the word Conſolation:</hi> And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We are to know, this is one of the ſweeteſt mercies in all Gods ſtore-houſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word <hi>conſolation.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and conſolation; and that in this valley of tears, where we meet with ſo much diſcomfort, where there are ſo many grieving and tormenting paſſages.</hi> This makes the mercy to be of greater moment. For what if a man had the abundance his heart can deſire, yet if he have no comfort in any thing, a dead man, yea a dead dog is better than ſuch an one. Inſomuch that a mans whole life is almoſt for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a comfortable life. <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> is ſo great a matter, that ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> placed utmoſt happineſs therein. Look over the whole world, and you will ſee, not every man that is moſt wiſe, or moſt great, not every one that liveth in moſt abundance and moſt honour, but he that liveth moſt <hi>comfortably,</hi> liveth the life moſt to be deſired. Yea many time a Crown of gold is a crown of thorns; and a cottage hath more <hi>comfort</hi> than a Palace. So that the mercy here ſpoken of, is the ſalt that ſeaſons all conditions; without this a man is no better than a <hi>Cain,</hi> or a <hi>Judas;</hi> without this every houſe and field is an hell. When therefore it's ſaid, <hi>The God of comfort,</hi> here is inſinuated the moſt deſirable thing that can be. Yea, it's no wonder to hear, that if a man hath wealth and honours, but without comfort, that his life is a torment. For although a man have true grace, and be an eminent ſervant of God, and therefore will be certainly bleſſed hereafter, yet becauſe he hath no <hi>comfort</hi> in his ſoul, his condition is very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſad: As you ſee it was with <hi>Job,</hi> yea with <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, though the only Sonne of God, yet becauſe without <hi>comfort,</hi> when at the ſame time he was full of grace and holineſs, what grief and agonies did he conflict with. So that your <hi>comfort</hi> is like oyl (it's called <hi>the oyl of gladneſs)</hi> for it will be alwayes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Comfort is ſuch a rare mercy, that unleſs God give it, it is not to be found in the heart of a man.</hi> For how can <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>ſinne</hi> be together? Every man hath by nature forfeited all his <hi>comforts.</hi> There is not the leaſt drop of <hi>comfort,</hi> but every man hath outed himſelf of it; ſo that man and the Devils are all alike in reſpect of deſerts. As the <hi>Devil</hi> cannot any where gather up ſo much as a crum of a <hi>comfort,</hi> ſo neither might any man living. The whole world might juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an hell, and not one <hi>drop of comfort</hi> to be found in it. Therefore that God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48709:88"/>
                  <hi>is a God of comfort</hi> to a believer, it's an unſpeakable mercy, for of himſelf cannot come any comfort, nothing but briars and thorns, nothing but helliſh torments and deſpair, will naturally ariſe in our hearts. So that <hi>comfort</hi> is the more to be prized, becauſe we have loſt all, and might juſtly be as full of horrour and fears, as we are of ſin. As ſin hath abounded, ſo not <hi>grace,</hi> but <hi>vengeance</hi> might abound much more. Hence</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>Therefore is God a God of conſolation, becauſe Chriſt hath made a full atonement for us by his bloud.</hi> Such a glorious expreſſion as this, could not have been true in the world, but for Chriſt; if no <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then no <hi>comfort.</hi> Hence in the Text it is ſaid, <hi>The Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>The God of comfort.</hi> So that as we are to pray in the name of Chriſt, ſo we are alſo in his name to offer up praiſe and thankſgiving. It's then through Chriſt alone, that he is a <hi>God of comfort;</hi> and indeed without Chriſt, he is the <hi>God of all wrath and vengeance,</hi> of all <hi>anger and judgements;</hi> his holineſs and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is ſuch, that were it not through him, he would be a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> and the moſt holy man would not be able to ſtand in his ſight. So that it coſt Chriſt dear to make a way and paſſage of comfort for us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>God through Chriſt being thus the fountain of all conſolation, hence it is that he doth moſt genuinely and properly of himſelf, ſhew mercy and vouchſafe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Even as the Bee of it ſelf makes honey, but never ſtings, except when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked. Thus if we walk not alwayes comfortably, if we live not in holy joy and gladneſs of heart, this ariſeth from our ſelves. The vapours that turn into ſtorms and thunder come from our own bowels, otherwiſe God would alwayes be communicating conſolations to us; we ſhut out the light from us, we turn ſweetneſs into bitterneſs. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God doth not afflict wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</hi> The works of juſtice are commonly called <hi>alienum opus;</hi> but Gods works of juſtice are his proper works, as well as of mercy; only our ſins ſtirre him up, and provoke him to the one, but his meer goodneſs and mercy inclineth to the other, ſo that now God would alwayes fill the hearts of his children with <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> did not they obſtruct it themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the third and laſt place, he is ſaid to be <hi>the God of all conſolation.</hi> There is <note place="margin">How he is a God of all conſolations.</note> 
                  <hi>the extent of it, All conſolation,</hi> which implieth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no conſolation but cometh from him; no true and ſolid comfort, but God beſtoweth it.</hi> As for that prophane and wicked mirth, which the Devil ſtirreth up ungodly men unto, that is not worth the name of <hi>joy,</hi> it's a madneſs, for they deſcend quick as it were to hell from theſe jollities; all true <hi>comfort</hi> is from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is implied, <hi>That God hath a ſtore-houſe of all kind of comforts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thy neceſſity and wants are, he can comfort thee.</hi> It is not every <hi>comfort</hi> that will heal every wound, but God hath a treaſury of all; if thy ſoul need <hi>comfort,</hi> he can <hi>comfort</hi> that; if thy body need <hi>comfort,</hi> he can do that. <hi>Oh then, let not theſe conſolations of God ſeem a ſmall thing to you!</hi> Job 15. 11.</p>

               <p>VVE ſhall now put both theſe deſcriptions of God joyntly together, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already conſidered them ſeverally. For ſeeing in the mercy of God is all our hope, Chriſt hath this Rainbow about his Throne. And although it may affect us to hear, that God is Wiſe, Omnipotent, of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty, yet nothing is ſo ſutable and proper for poor ſinners, as to hear of <hi>Gods mercy.</hi> Therefore I ſhall at this time enlarge further about it, and ſo conclude. And that which I ſhall deliver, ſhall be laid down in ſo many Propoſitions, which will be to obviate either Practical or Doctrinal Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The mercy and comforts of God, this glorious Nature of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Propoſitions obviating pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrical objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the mercy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of God.</note> 
                  <hi>he is ready to pity thoſe that are miſerable, is ſo to be managed in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick preaching thereof, that it be a ſovereign Antidote againſt all despair, and yet a curb againſt all preſumption.</hi> For ſo it falleth out, that we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open the treaſures of Gods mercy, and diſcover the glory of his grace and goodneſs to the humbled ſinner, but preſently the carnal prophane heart is ready to encourage himſelf thereby. It is therefore the part of a wiſe Diſpenſer of this glad tidings, to conſider the ſubjects with whom he hath to do, and accordingly to publiſh terrour to whom terrour is due, wrath to whom wrath is due. And then on the other ſide, peace to whom peace belongs, mercy to whom mercy belongs. Though therefore God ſtyle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>The God of the fatherleſs, and the widow, that he is pitifull to ſuch as are miſerable:</hi> Though very wicked (it may be) and prophane, yet this is with a general mercy onely; his peculiar and ſpecial mercies are onely to thoſe that fear him. If then a man go on wilfully in his ungodly wayes, if he will ſtill retain his tranſgreſſions, he muſt not think to find God <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull</hi> to him, he will find <hi>David</hi>'s prayer fulfilled, <hi>Pſal. 59. 5. Be not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to any wicked tranſgreſſour.</hi> This bread is for children, not for dogs; yet how difficultly can we keep ſuch off from applying this mercy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Thoſe are commonly moſt confident of it, to whom it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; therefore beaſtly men are barred off from coming near this Mount; This pearl is kept from Swine. When we meet with broken contrite hearts, here we diſplay the <hi>mercy of God</hi> with all our might; To ſuch we ſay, <hi>Gods mercies</hi> are infinitely more than <hi>their ſinnes;</hi> That although they had the ſinnes of all the men in the world, yet they were but as a drop to the Sun-beams
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48709:89"/>
of his mercy, which will quickly dry them up: To ſuch we ſay, God doth as eaſily pardon great ſinnes, as little; as the Sun doth enlighten one place with as much eaſe as another: To ſuch we ſay, That it's their duty to hope in <hi>Gods mercy;</hi> that they cannot diſhonour God more than by looking upon him, as one who is hardly brought to remit offences: That it is Gods will we ſhould come to this fountain, and drink abundantly of it. We tell them, that they cannot think ſo much of ſinne to condemn them, as they may of <hi>the multitude of Gods mercies to ſave them:</hi> To ſuch we ſay, That when they have thought all they can, yet there is more in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than they can go to the bottom of. God is ſaid <hi>to forget ſinnes,</hi> but he cannot forget his property of <hi>mercy.</hi> Thus you ſee that <hi>mercy</hi> is ſo to be held out, as the cloud was in the wilderneſs, it was light to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to guide them, but darkneſs to the <hi>Egyptian.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is indeed matter of terrour to every preſumptuous ſinner, for he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it, but it is full of beauty and reviving to the wounded heart. Hence the whole drift of the Scripture is to repreſent this grace and mercy of God to an humbled ſinner. This is the main ſcope of it. For who could or dare think of God any otherwiſe, but a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> till the Scripture hath revealed him otherwiſe? And indeed the Parable of a <hi>Shepherd fetching home his loſt ſheep,</hi> is comfortable; yet Chriſt exceedeth that Shepherd, for he ſought for his ſheep, as goods that he needed, that he wanted; but Chriſt doth for us, whom he doth not want, he is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without us. Again that alſo is a refreſhing Parable of the <hi>Father entertaining ſo mercifully his prodigal Sonne;</hi> but yet Chriſt exceedeth that Father alſo; for there the Sonne came firſt and humbled himſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for favour; but God he doth firſt ſeek us out by his <hi>mercy; We do not chooſe him, but he chooſeth us.</hi> Though <hi>Vorſtius</hi> doth diſtinguiſh of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace to believers, calling one <hi>ordinary,</hi> which God vouchſafeth to thoſe who ſeek him in the uſe of means; and another <hi>extraordinary,</hi> which God (he ſaith) ſometimes but rarely vouchſafeth, and that is, while men never think of God, yea in wayes of oppoſition to God, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> yet indeed we may ſay of all that are converted, <hi>That God thinketh of them before they think of God.</hi> It is he that prevents them; his grace finds them out, and prepareth them for mercy. Again, Chriſt compareth himſelf to the <hi>Phyſician;</hi> but what <hi>Phyſician</hi> healeth as he doth? Other <hi>Phyſicians</hi> they make their <hi>Patients</hi> ſick and bleed, to help them to health; but Chriſt, he himſelf is <hi>wounded,</hi> and <hi>his bloud is ſhed for to ſave us.</hi> All this is to ſhew, That we cannot imbolden and incourage the ſincere converts enough; but the more hopefull and confident thoughts he hath of Gods mercy, the more pleaſing it is to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We muſt not judge of Gods mercy without Scripture-light and guidance, for if we do, we ſholl thereby encourage our ſelves in wicked wayes, and yet ſay, God is mercifull.</hi> And truly this is the poyſon that many ſuck down, they judge of Gods mercy according to their own humane pity and compaſſion; and thereupon never conſider his Juſtice, his Wiſdome, his Holineſs, as well as Mercy. So that this is diligently to be conſidered that we muſt not apprehend of God as full of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> any otherwayes than the Scripture doth manifeſt him, and that will be ſalt to ſeaſon you againſt the abuſe of <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> ſo as <hi>to turn his grace into wantonneſſe.</hi> How many are there undo themſelves for want of a Scripture conſideration of Gods mercy, both <hi>Doctrinally</hi> and <hi>Practically.</hi> As</p>
               <p>In the firſt place. <hi>What is the reaſon, that ſome have imbraced that old and unſavoury Doctrine of</hi> Origen, <hi>That all both men and Devils after ſo many years in hell, ſhall be releaſed from thoſe torments?</hi> Why is this? But becauſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48709:90"/>
theſe <hi>miſericordiſts</hi> conceive of <hi>Gods mercy</hi> without <hi>Scripture-grounds.</hi> They think it doth not ſtand with the pity and compaſſion of God, to let ſo many thouſands of his creatures lie roaring in hell, and he never deliver them. But is not this againſt Scripture, which calls it <hi>everlaſting fire,</hi> and that there ſhall never be any coming out of that priſon, <hi>That of their torments there ſhall be no end?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again in the ſecond place, <hi>There are thoſe that do with open mouth cry</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> Doctrine concerning Gods abſolute Decrees, and how they ſtand with the mercy of God.</note> 
                  <hi>down the Calviniſts as blasphemous againſt Gods mercy, and making God to be more unmercifull and cruel, then any Tyrant that ever lived: Becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſuch do hold, God did by abſolute, and irrespective fatal Decrees, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the greater part of mankind to ſinne, and then for their ſinne to damne them.</hi> As <hi>Tiberius,</hi> deſiroes to put a veſtal Virgin to death, cauſed her violently to be defloured, and then becauſe ſhe was defloured, he put her to death. But</p>
               <p>Firſt, Here is a falſe and an odious repreſentation of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> Doctrine; and if their opinion, as they truly ſtate it out of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> be thought to be againſt the nature of <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> it's becauſe they do not conſider Gods ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream dominion, his Juſtice and Holineſs, as well as his Mercy. But that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do not any wayes diminiſh <hi>the gracious and mercifull Nature of God,</hi> by their opinions in <hi>the Doctrine of Election, efficacious Converſion,</hi> &amp;c. will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appear to thoſe that are candid and ingenuous. I ſuppoſe <hi>Election</hi> to be an <hi>Act of mercy,</hi> relating to our miſery in <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, though the learned Doctor <hi>Twiſs</hi> diſputeth much againſt it, <hi>Lib. 1. contra Armin. digr.</hi> 9. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. They hold, <hi>That there is no man is damned, but for his ſinne; Their deſtruction is of themſelves.</hi> Neither do they ſay, <hi>That God by any Decree compelled</hi> Adam <hi>to ſinne at firſt, but</hi> Adam <hi>ſinned as voluntarily, and as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if God had made no permiſſive Decree about his fall.</hi> It is true indeed we ſay, <hi>That God hath predetermining Decrees</hi> efficacious <hi>about what is good</hi> permiſſive, <hi>about what is evil;</hi> but yet we ſay, <hi>Theſe Decrees do not alter the nature of ſecond cauſes, but according to the nature of them, ſo is Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence attempered thereunto.</hi> Therefore we acknowledge that of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola eſt illa miſericordia, quae facit eſſe miſerum, ut miſereatur,</hi> That is cruel mercy, which makes miſerable, that it may ſhew mercy; <hi>Adam</hi> did voluntarily ſin, ſo that God was not to be blamed.</p>
               <p>Neither do we call thoſe <hi>Decrees of God Abſolute and Irrespective, as if hereby all means were excluded from accompliſhing the end we are elected to. When God elects a man to ſalvation,</hi> we ſay, <hi>in this Election is comprehended holineſs, as the way to happineſs.</hi> And therefore to impoſe ſuch an <hi>Irrespe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Decree</hi> upon the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as if their meaning was, <hi>God had decreed to ſave ſome men, whether wicked, or not wicked: That it was all one, whether prophane or godly.</hi> This is an horrible calumny. It is true, we ſay, it's <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi> becauſe God did not look to any thing in us, as a cauſe, or a merit, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to his <hi>Election,</hi> yet we ſay, <hi>God elects to faith and holineſs, as well as to ſalvation.</hi> Therefore we do not injure the <hi>mercifull Nature of God;</hi> but they do his <hi>holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>wiſe Nature;</hi> yea they diminiſh his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> in our <hi>Election,</hi> and attributing too much to man. For whereas the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith <hi>Rom. 9. It is not of him that willeth or runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy;</hi> They will make it to be as well of <hi>him that runneth, as of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy:</hi> And though in words they ſeem to give the priority to <hi>Gods grace</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> yet in reality they do not. If then that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> be true, <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia non eſt gratia ullo modo, niſi ſit gratuita omni modo,</hi> then all thoſe are enemies to the grace and mercy of God, who take in the leaſt meaſure from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We do not enervate the mercy of God,</hi> in holding, <hi>the Election of ſome
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48709:90"/>
onely to eternal life, becauſe God might juſtly, if he had pleaſed, damned all, and none could have accuſed him for want of mercy.</hi> For hath not God bound up in chains of darkneſs all the <hi>apoſtate Angels?</hi> Are not every one of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to <hi>eternal torments?</hi> Yet they are more noble and excellent creatures, than man is. Oh then the <hi>mercy of God</hi> that any is ſaved, ſeeing that all might juſtly be damned!</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Not to enlarge on this, <hi>God is mercifull in this Abſolute Election, duly explained, becauſe hereby a very great number are ſure to be ſaved.</hi> God by this Decree of his, will ſo work in <hi>time,</hi> that they ſhall be <hi>called, juſtified,</hi> and at laſt <hi>glorified;</hi> for <hi>Election</hi> will obtain. Now doth not this Doctrine more commend the <hi>mercy of God,</hi> than the <hi>Arminians Conditional Decrees?</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, no man in the world may be ſaved. For notwithſtanding <hi>Gods Decrees</hi> and <hi>Will, to ſave all men,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Chriſts dying for all men,</hi> yet they acknowledge it poſſible, not any one man be ſaved. For <hi>God</hi> (they ſay) <hi>leaveth a man to the good uſe of his Free-will, he doth not alter or change by his efficacious and wonderfull grace any mans heart; and if God do no more, who then can be ſaved?</hi> They cannot inſtance in one <hi>Heathen,</hi> that ever yet uſed his naturals well, thereby to partake of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. So that if all be left to man, and God ſhould not ſhew mercy, no one man would be ſaved. Therefore our Doctrine is a <hi>mercifull one,</hi> and theirs is cruel.</p>
               <p>In the third general place, <hi>The Socinians, they blame all the Orthodox, as evacuating the mercy of God, becauſe,</hi> we ſay, <hi>that the Juſtice of God being ſatisfied through the bloud of Chriſt as a ranſome, we thereby obtain remiſſion of ſinnes. Now</hi> (they ſay) <hi>how abſurd and contradictory is this, God is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by a juſt paiment to pardon ſinne, and yet it's the meer mercy of God to forgive it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this we anſwer, That though the pardon of ſinne be of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to Chriſt, yet it is wholly of <hi>mercy</hi> to us. It is not any thing we could do, that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pardon; if we could merit or ſatisfie the <hi>Juſtice of God</hi> by the works we do, then indeed it would not be of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> to us; but this <hi>Juſtice</hi> is only between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Father:</hi> So that it's wholly of <hi>mercy</hi> to us, both in reſpect that he hath found out a <hi>Saviour</hi> for us, as alſo in <hi>applying</hi> the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of <hi>Chriſts death.</hi> For though Chriſt become into the world, yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eternally periſh? It is therefore unſpeakable mercy to thee, that thy ſins are pardoned, that thou art converted, and ſo many thouſands abide under the power of <hi>Satan</hi> and ſinne. Therefore when <hi>Gods mercy</hi> is ſpoken of in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of ſinne, it is perpetually in reſpect of us, not of Chriſt. Thus you ſee, judging of <hi>Gods mercy</hi> without <hi>Scripture-light,</hi> into how many <hi>Doctrinal errors</hi> it may plunge us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For want of <hi>Scripture-direction,</hi> the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Antinomian</hi> oppoſe the <hi>mercy of God,</hi> but in extream contrary wayes. <hi>Though God be mercifull, yet he hath ſo ordained, that none ſhall partake of his mercies in time, but thoſe who by his grace are inabled to believe and repent, as the way to ſalvation.</hi> Now the <hi>Papiſt</hi> injureth the <hi>mercy of God,</hi> for he will have his <hi>Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> with other holy works, the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>cauſe of his ſalvation,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to have <hi>eternal life,</hi> as <hi>meer alms from God.</hi> But the <hi>Antinomian</hi> to avoid this <hi>Scilla</hi> falls into <hi>Charybdis,</hi> he affirmeth, <hi>a mercy, and that of Justification, even while we are ſinners, before we do either believe or repent.</hi> But the <hi>Scripture-mercy</hi> lieth between both.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us conſider, What <hi>Practical Danger</hi> we are in, by conceiving of God as a <hi>mercifull God,</hi> without <hi>Scripture-informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We are apt to flatter our ſelves with Gods mercy, though we allow our ſelves
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48709:91"/>
in our ſins and iniquities, whereas the Scripture ſpeaks not a drop of mercy to ſuch</hi> Have you not many dreadfull examples of Gods anger and terrour as well as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? What was the caſting of all the Angels into eternal blackneſs for one ſinfull thought, and that the firſt which they were guilty of, giving them no ſpace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, no day of grace, affording no means for their recovery? Is not this an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods ſeverity? But you will ſay, This was to <hi>Angels,</hi> he is more <hi>mercifull</hi> to man. But conſider that example of Gods Juſtice in drowning the whole world, ſave eight perſons; Doth not that proclaim God is juſt and angry againſt ſinne, as well as <hi>mercifull;</hi> not to ſpare the whole world, becauſe it had corrupted its wayes, but to drown ſuch an innumerable company of men, women and children, yea to deſtroy the whole earth, as it were? Oh, who can ſtand before the anger of God! Have we not alſo a formidable demonſtration of Gods anger againſt <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> when fire and brimſtone was rained from Heaven, to deſtroy thoſe Cities, and all that did belong to them? What had the little children done? They could not be guilty of thoſe unclean vices, but God cutteth off all. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other inſtances of Gods wrath we have in Scripture, eſpecially the day of Judgement, will be a dreadfull manifeſtation of it to the wicked, and therefore the Scripture will informe us in that, as well as of Gods mercy.</p>
               <p>A ſecond <hi>Practical Errour</hi> (I ſhall conclude with) <hi>that neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth the thoughts of Gods mercy without Scripture-direction, is to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a mans ſelf in his ſinnes, becauſe God is mercifull.</hi> Every wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon turneth this honey into gall. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome, who made thoſe wretched inferences, <hi>Let us ſinne that grace may abound.</hi> Take heed then of having any ſuch wicked thought ariſing in thy heart, <hi>God is mercifull,</hi> therefore I will go to my luſts again: Oh no; the Scripture repreſents Gods mercies for another end, to repent and be converted from thy evil wayes, <hi>Rom. 2, Knoweſt thou not the goodneſſe of God would lead thee to repentance.</hi> Oh then do not abuſe the mercy of God! for there is a time coming when there will be no more mercy. It's called the <hi>day of wrath;</hi> thou ſhalt meet with nothing but terrour, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 18. The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> and <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> and there is no greater ſign of a <hi>veſſel of wrath,</hi> one fitted and prepared for deſtruction, then to grow wanton by the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God,</hi> to be evil, becauſe he is good; ſo much <hi>mercy</hi> abuſed will one day be turned into ſo much <hi>vengeance.</hi>

               <p>IN the former verſe we had the Reaſons of our <hi>bleſſing of God</hi> ſet down, by the deſcription of that glorious attribute of his, <hi>The Father of mercies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In this verſe the Apoſtle doth further amplifie the cauſe of this duty of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> viz. <hi>from the effect,</hi> and fruit of this property of his, <hi>He is not only a God of conſolation,</hi> habitually and potentially, as it were. He is not a fountain ſealed up; but this Sunne doth alwayes irradiate its beams; As he is a God of conſolation, ſo he <hi>doth comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in the words we have the <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Cauſality</hi> attributed to God, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>who is comforting,</hi> that doth never ceaſe to do it, that never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his conſolations; It's his nature to be alwayes comforting. As the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe he is alwayes <hi>tempting.</hi> The word in humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors is uſed frequently of him, who calleth another to him; but in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> either of him that <hi>intreateth</hi> and <hi>prayeth,</hi> or of him that <hi>exhorteth,</hi> or as in the Text, <hi>of him that comforteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Subject of this conſolation, <hi>us]</hi> That is either generally all believers, or <hi>us Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> in the Church. For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might ſpeak this to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate that ſcandal, which many were ready to take at the afflictions and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as if they were hated of God, and were nothing but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors. Therefore ſome part of this Chapter is a narrative of his preſſures and apologetical, in declaring the great goodneſs of God thereby to the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The particular wherein, <hi>in tribulation]</hi> Light can come into this dark dungeon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Extent</hi> of this, <hi>All our tribulation]</hi> God can turn the hardeſt ſtones into bread: <hi>All]</hi> either of mind or body.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>conſequent Effect</hi> of this, <hi>That we may be able to comfort them,</hi> &amp;c.] God many times doth in an exemplary manner exerciſe the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that they may experimentally be able to inſtruct ſuch who are tempted.</p>
               <p>We begin with that efficiency given to God, <hi>who comforteth,</hi> is <hi>comforting,</hi> and obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That as God is the God of all comfort, ſo he doth actually put forth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God not only can, but doth comfort his children.</note> 
                  <hi>to thoſe that are his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods attributes may be truly affirmed of him, though they never be put forth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48709:92"/>
into act, God would have been <hi>Omnipotent, Mercifull, Wiſe,</hi> though he had not created the world, only the creation of the world did demonſtrate thoſe Attributes. Thus God may be called, <hi>The God of comfort,</hi> or a <hi>mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in reſpect of his Nature and Inclination, though actually he doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort any; but God is a fountain communicating himſelf into ſtreams of comfort, he will make his people taſte and feel what he is by Nature. Now when it's ſaid, <hi>That God comforteth,</hi> you muſt underſtand this both in <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</hi> That <hi>ſpiritual comfort</hi> comes alone from God is plain, becauſe the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is called the <hi>Comforter.</hi> We cannot have one drop of heavenly conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> infuſe it into us. If the children of God could have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort when they will, would they walk ſo diſconſolately, and cry out of their dark troubled ſouls as they do, but then even earthly comfort, to take delight in the lawfull contentments God doth allow us, to take delight and joy in theſe corporal mercies, this is alſo from God, <hi>Eccleſ. 2. 24, 26. Eccleſ. 3. 13. Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 18. You ſee the Wiſeman affirmeth it often, <hi>That a man cannot take any joy or delight even in thoſe lawfull things, unleſs it be given him of God.</hi> All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort then of all ſorts ariſeth from him.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider the way or manner of Gods comforting. For as it is a great <note place="margin">How God comforteth his people.</note> and profitable Queſtion to examine, How God doth convert and ſanctifie, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, how he doth <hi>comfort?</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, You muſt lay this foundation, <hi>That God doth comfort two wayes, either immediately, when he doth by himſelf work upon the ſoul:</hi> Or <hi>mediately, when he comforteth by ſuch means as he hath appointed thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us then in the next place conſider, What are thoſe <hi>immediate workings of God upon the ſoul, whereby he maketh the heart joyfull?</hi> For <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4. ſaith, <hi>God had put more joy into his heart, then any man can have in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all temporal mercies.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Therefore God doth comfort by illuminating and opening the underſtanding and opening the underſtanding, to know and ſee the grounds and reaſons of comfort.</hi> And certainly, this is of great conducement to have the heart <hi>comforted,</hi> when the underſtanding is rightly convinced of the grounds of comfort. For as the dark night is apt to beget fears and terrours, ſo darkneſs in the underſtanding is a great cauſe of all that terrour and diſconſolateneſs, which Gods own children may many times lie under. So that as God in converſion and humiliation for ſinne, begins with conviction upon the heart, ſo alſo in <hi>conſolation</hi> and <hi>comfort.</hi> The great impediment to a godly mans comfort, is want of ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conviction about the cauſes of comfort. As it was with <hi>Hagar</hi> in the wilderneſs, ſhe ſate weeping for her child, and gave over all as deſperate, till God opened her eyes, and made her ſee a fountain. Thus the broken heart, judgeth it ſelf in a wilderneſs deſtitute of all comfort, ſeeth nothing but matter of deſpair and damnation, till God enlighten the underſtanding about <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds</hi> in the Goſpel. As for example, when the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> enlightens us to receive <hi>comfort,</hi> it giveth us the eye ſalve:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To look upon Chriſt revealed in the Gospel, as the full cauſe and ground of all our comfort, as well as on ſinne.</hi> Generally the people of God in the firſt workings of the ſoul, look upon nothing but their ſins, behold nothing but ſinne; but God will not let them alone in this agony; he enlightens them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they ſhall ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as <hi>ſinne,</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> as well as the <hi>Law,</hi> he giveth them eyes to behold the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> when ſtung. Hence the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> John 16. 9, 10. doth not only <hi>convince of ſinne,</hi> but of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> alſo. The Devil he indeed moveth in thoſe troubled waters of thy ſoul, and would keep thee off from Chriſt, as the Diſciples did the blind man, but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> will not leave the ſoul in theſe wounds, in theſe ſtraits, but doth carry him up from the mount of <hi>curſing</hi> to the mount of <hi>bleſſing.</hi> And certainly the wiſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48709:92"/>
men could not more rejoyce to ſee the ſtarre, than the godly heart doth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſt after the ſtorms and tempeſts in his ſoul. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. calleth it, <hi>The revealing of the Sonne in him.</hi> This then we are inabled to do by God, not only to know ſinne in the terrour and ſting of it, but alſo Chriſt in his fulneſs and excellency. How was <hi>Paul</hi> affected with this, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 1. I deſire to know nothing but Chriſt crucified?</hi> This therefore is a ſpecial work of God to make us look with both eyes, to make thee ſee ſinne as well as Chriſt, and Chriſt as well as ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God doth convince the ſoul of Chriſt, what a full and glorious Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our he is; ſo alſo in the ſecond place, <hi>Of our duty to receive him, and to lay hold on him.</hi> And this is a further ſtep to comfort, when God doth ſo farre open the eyes, as to ſee not only a full and ſufficient Chriſt, but alſo that it's a duty in particular to apply this Chriſt, and to reſt upon him for <hi>comfort</hi> and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This is a further diſcovery ſtill. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gal. 2. Who gave himſelf for me, and loved me:</hi> And <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, <hi>My God, and my Lord.</hi> It is one of the bleſſed truths diſcovered in the Reformation out of Popery, <hi>That it is not our duty to believe in the general onely, that Chriſt is a Saviour, but to reſt on him alſo for the pardon of my ſinnes:</hi> That this is the <hi>Faith</hi> that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: That this is moſt acceptable and precious unto God: That unbelief not only in the general, but as it faileth in this particular, in not applying, in not appropriating Chriſt to the ſoul, is that which will damn a man. Oh then what bleſſed and comfortable light is that, which God bringeth into the ſoul, when he ſhall make thee ſee, that though a ſinner, though burdened, though unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, yet it's thy duty to go to Chriſt to be eaſed? That he commands thee with that woman, not only to touch the hem of his garments, but to lay hold on Chriſt himſelf. This particular faith is that, which the ſoul is hardly convinced of. Though others may draw nigh to Chriſt, yet may I? But he cometh at laſt to be perſwaded of this truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God comforts by enlightning the mind, that a comfortable, joyfull life, ariſing from peace with God, is a moſt acceptable thing to God; that it brings honour and glory to God; and that on the other ſide, to walk heavily, and in a dejected manner is to diſhonour and reproach God.</hi> That God doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look to our gracious walking, but alſo to our comfortable walking, and that we demonſtrate the Kingdom of Heaven to be begun in us in joy, as well as in mortification, <hi>Rom. 14. 17. The Kingdom of God is righteouſneſſe, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> You ſee <hi>Joy</hi> as well as <hi>Righteouſneſſe;</hi> The children of God they are not quickly perſwaded of this, they think ſuch as they are, may not walk comfortably: It's not for them to rejoyce, but at laſt they come to ſee, that they were ſinfully kept up by ſlaviſh fears, and ſervile dejections, that the Kingdome of God requireth Conſolation as well as Sanctification. Thus you ſee the firſt general way, how God <hi>comforteth,</hi> viz. <hi>by enlightning the mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, and principally God comforteth, <hi>By preparing and faſhioning the heart, by making it fit and ready to receive comfort.</hi> For all the while thou art enlightned only, and haſt not an heart fitted to receive it, thou art like <hi>Moſes</hi> that ſaw the good Land of promiſe, but he could not enter into it. And thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it falls out ſometimes, that when the mind is enlightned enough, yet the heart is heavy. They cannot delight and rejoyce in the promiſe; they would gladly do it, they heartily pray for it; but their heart ſinketh down like a ſtone within them. Therefore God hath a further degree in comforting, and that is by raiſing up the heart; by making it ready to receive conſolation. For as God can humble the proud heart, and ſoften the hard heart, ſo he can eaſily <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>revive</hi> the grieved heart. Thus as it is in ſanctification; it's not enough for God to illuminate the mind, unleſs he alſo change the heart, and make us to will
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48709:93"/>
and to do: So it's not enough for God to teach us our duty about comfort, but actually to work the heart for it. Hence 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 6. you have a notable Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute given to God, <hi>God that comforteth thoſe that are caſt down,</hi> Iſa. 51. 11, 12. See there with what command God ſpeaketh, <hi>That they ſhall have comfort;</hi> They ſhall <hi>obtain gladneſſe and joy.</hi> So that as God is above the heart in <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> thus he is alſo in <hi>conſolation:</hi> He will comfort, and what man or Devil can hinder it? As in matter of grace God declareth, as Omnipotency and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, when he ſaith, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh:</hi> ſo in matter of <hi>conſolation,</hi> I will take away the grieved, the troubled, the deſpairing heart, and give an heart of joy, peace, and heavenly reſt of ſoul.</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>God doth comfort</hi> removendo prohibens, <hi>by removing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is obſtructive and deſtructive of comfort.</hi> As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By chaining up the Devil, who is not only an enemy to the graces, but alſo the comforts of Gods people.</hi> As the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> is a <hi>Comforter,</hi> ſo the <hi>Devil</hi> is the prince of darkneſs, a <hi>Tempter</hi> to unbelief, to ſad, and ſoul, yea and body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murdering thoughts. God therefore doth reſtrain him in his temptations, in his ſad ſuggeſtions. For we ſee by <hi>Job</hi>'s inſtance, the Devil cannot go any further, than he is licenſed by God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God doth ſubdue not onely the Devil without, but alſo that corruption within, which doth vehemently incline to unbelieving, vexing and tormenting thoughts.</hi> For although a man naturally be in ſecurity, in ſelf-eaſe and carnal preſumption, yet when once awakened for ſinne, and feeling the terrour of the Lord thereby, then we are as peeviſh, as froward againſt the promiſes, as ever formerly we were againſt the precepts; <hi>Adam</hi> endeavours to hide himſelf from God upon his ſinne. We ſee in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> what ſad and dreadfull effects the guilt of conſcience would work in every one, did not God command thoſe winds and tempeſts to be ſtill. Therefore God doth repreſs theſe, and thereby we are more ready for comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God doth by his grace prevent and keep us from ſinne, he daily preſerveth us from many ſad falls, which if plunged into, we ſhould preſently chaſe away all our comfort.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> was left, and fell into thoſe groſs ſins, all his joy was immediately loſt; therefore he complaineth <hi>of his broken bones,</hi> and prayeth <hi>for joy to be reſtored to him;</hi> what horrour, what hell would quickly be raiſed in thy ſoul every day, every night, upon every temptation? Did not the grace of God preſerve thee? <hi>Spira</hi> loſt all <hi>comfort</hi> by <hi>Apoſtaſie?</hi> And thus many Chriſtians did in times of perſecution, in a great meaſure by their revolt, though they recovered again. Therefore little doeſt thou know, how much God worketh for thy comfort by preventing ſuch ſins, which would make horrible wounds and gaſhes in thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>God comforts thee by delivering thee from all ſuch Doctrines, though taught by many of great and eminent learning, which yet in their own nature tend to make the heart uncomfortable.</hi> How wonderfully did God work for the comfort of <hi>Luther,</hi> who profeſſed the unſpeakable tremblings and fears of ſoul he was in, and being in captivity by the <hi>Doctrine of works,</hi> as then tought in Popery, he could have no comfort, but often wiſhed he had never been a man, till God comforted him by delivering him from thoſe falſe Doctrines? Thus the Doctrine of the <hi>Apoſtaſie of true Saints</hi> doth utterly daſh all comfort from the believer; he muſt neceſſarily be in miſerable tormenting fears all the day long. And ſo have we done with that <hi>immediate way of Gods comforting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Mediate way,</hi> is by thoſe means which he hath appointed to be as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits running wine for us. And they are</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Scriptures. David</hi> profeſſeth much quickning and comfort he had by them. So <hi>Rom. 15. 4. The comfort of the Scriptures.</hi> They are a cordial, a tree
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48709:93"/>
of life; They direct to comfort, exhort to comfort all ſuch as are poor in ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Miniſters, They are ſons of conſolation and comfort.</hi> The Word they preach is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the joyfull noiſe.</hi> Even the very feet of ſuch who <hi>bring the glad tidings,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>bleſſed;</hi> They have a <hi>tongue of the learned,</hi> to ſpeak a ſeaſonable word for ſuch as are contrite in ſpirit. They are not to <hi>quench the broken reed.</hi> Though to the obſtinate ſinner, we bring the hammer and fire of the Word; yet to the broken heart, we bring balm and oil.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God comforts by the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> In them he doth peculiarly ſeal <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>comfort.</hi> Therefore is the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>giving of thanks.</hi> Thus doth the Lord by theſe means abundantly provide for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>

               <p>THe next particular, which followeth in order, as the Text ſtands divided, is the <hi>Subject</hi> whom God doth thus <hi>comfort,</hi> and that is ſaid to be <hi>Us, who comforteth us;</hi> that is, both <hi>us believers,</hi> in a general ſenſe, and <hi>us Apoſtles,</hi> in a particular manner. For they being like <hi>Uriah</hi> in the fore-front of the battel; and more aſſaulted by the Devil within, and enemies without, they do need the greater comfort. But we ſhall handle it in the moſt large ſenſe, and obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is a God of all comfort unto believers only.</hi>

               <p>For this <hi>[Us]</hi> in the Text, is not only determinative, to ſhew who they are into whoſe wounds God doth thus pour oyl, but alſo reſtrictive to ſuch and ſuch only. Indeed the wicked ones of the world, may have comfort in outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; They may rejoyce in the good things of this life; and this is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Solomon, To be a gift of God,</hi> but theſe worldly joyes do become a ſinne, and a curſe to them. The Poet ſaid well,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>O miſeri quorum gaudia crimen habet!</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Their very joyes do become like wine to men in a feavor, though refreſhing a little, yet inflaming and increaſing the diſeaſe more. So that theſe worldly joys, being not univerſal, nor pure and unmixed; yea being the ſeed of eternal grief and torment, therefore they may be well excluded from the name of <hi>joy,</hi> and the Doctrine be truly aſſerted, <hi>That God is a God of conſolation onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us explicate this truth. And</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:48709:94"/>
Firſt, We are to know, <hi>That God doth not only vouchſafe grace, but comfort alſo and delight to his people, in the exerciſe of thoſe graces.</hi> He doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give <hi>bread</hi> that ſtrengthens, but <hi>wine</hi> that makes the heart glad. <hi>Grace,</hi> that carrieth us out to honour God, to love him, and live to him; but <hi>comfort,</hi> that is for our encouragement, that is to ſweeten and facilitate the heart in doing ſo. So that if a man have never ſo much grace and holineſs, yet if he want this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as you ſee it was with <hi>Job,</hi> with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. he prayed ſo earneſtly for the reſtoring of it again to him, all his deſirable things periſh. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf under thoſe agonies he conflicted with, had an Angel to comfort him. So that you ſee they are two diſtinct gifts of God; to give <hi>Grace,</hi> and to give <hi>comfort;</hi> therefore the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> hath a two-fold work, both to ſanctifie, and alſo to comfort; yet though diſtinct, God doth many times joyn them together; yea there is ſome unuſual impediment, if joy doth not alwayes follow grace, and that like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> they do not alwayes appear toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> is comprehended under the name of <hi>gladneſſe</hi> in that expreſſion, <hi>Pſ. l.</hi> 45. 7. applied to Chriſt, <hi>Heb. 1. 9. Thou haſt anointed him with the oyl of gladneſs,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was; ſo alſo are his members thus <hi>anointed with the oyl of gladneſſe.</hi> God then doth not only ſanctifie and make his people holy, but he alſo doth fill their hearts with joy and gladneſs. Thus <hi>Acts 9. 31. They in the Churches walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt:</hi> Only when we ſay, That God giveth his people <hi>comfort</hi> as well as <hi>grace.</hi> You muſt know the <hi>comforts</hi> are of two ſorts; Sometimes they are <hi>concomitant,</hi> ſo that even in the very exerciſes of grace, they find unſpeakable joy and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The very Heathens had ſome glimmering of this, when they ſaid <hi>Virtus</hi> was <hi>ſibi ipſi praemium, Virtue it ſelf was a reward, as well as duty,</hi> becauſe of the great tranquillity and contentation of mind that it brought to the ſoul. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as wicked actions have an immediate horrour and remorſe of conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying them. And then</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>conſequent joyes,</hi> which follow after the work is done, as <hi>Paul</hi> found at the 12th verſe, <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of a good conſcience.</hi> So that a man of an ill conſcience, who hath ſtings from that, though all the world applaud him, yet he cannot have any true ſolid joy. <hi>Quid proderit tibi non habere conſcium, habenti conſcientiam.</hi> The <hi>Martyrs</hi> they found concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant joyes in their moſt dreadfull ſufferings, <hi>Act. 5. 41. The Apoſtles went away rejoycing, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſts Name.</hi> They mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their ſtripes, nor their reproach and diſgrace, but they went away rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, not from hearing the Word, from prayer, from ſuch holy Ordinances, but even from ſcourges and ſtripes. But in many other duties and ſervices for God, though for the preſent we may feel no <hi>joy,</hi> yet there are <hi>ſubſequent joyes</hi> that may ariſe long after. For as ſinne may not ſting for a while, as we ſee in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s brethren, the guilt of their conſcience awakened them many years after: So the comfort of holy duties, though for the preſent thou mayeſt not apprehend them, yet ſometimes or other God will revive them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Although God giveth not only grace, but comfort to his people, yet we are not to ſerve him onely for comforts ſake, but for his own ſake, and that while he denieth us the breſts of conſolation to ſuck on, yet we are as fervently and zealouſly to obey him, as ever.</hi> It is many times the ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of Gods children, that they want comfort, and thereupon are deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and diſcouraged; they care not for praying, for hearing; they have no heart for the Ordinances, and all becauſe they find their hearts like a barren wilderneſſe full of howling beaſts. Oh, when they have comfort, then they can runne the way of Gods Commandments, then they have fire in their boſome! But when this is gone, they become like a ſtone, or a lump of earth. But although it be true, <hi>That the joy of the Lord is our
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48709:94"/>
ſtrength,</hi> Nehem. 8. 10. yet for all that it is too low and mercenary to ſerve him onely for comfort. This is <hi>Amor concupiſcentiae,</hi> not <hi>amicitiae</hi> towards God. The grace of love carrieth us to God ſo, that we chooſe him, and delight in him above all things; that though he ſhould not give us Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and everlaſting glory, yet we were to <hi>love</hi> him, becauſe he is the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and moſt excellent good:</hi> How much more than are we to ſerve God, to be diligent in his work, though we find not thoſe experimental ſuavities upon our ſouls for the preſent? Therefor thou art to deny thy ſelf in this matter of joy, when God diſpenſeth it to thee, walk thankfully, humbly, and fruitfully under it: And when in darkneſs, in deſolateneſs of ſoul, yet let not thy ſoul abate in love and ſervice to God. The <hi>Stoick</hi> was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, that he thought he could not be virtuous, who did any virtuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the delight and ſweetneſs that followeth it: They would not have <hi>Virtus propter voluptatem,</hi> but <hi>voluptas propter virtutem.</hi> How much more ſhould our Chriſtianity teach us to preferre Gods will, and his honour, above all conſolations. If <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>Though he kill me, yet I will truſt in him;</hi> then do thou, though when thou askeſt for <hi>bread,</hi> he give thee a <hi>ſtone,</hi> when thou askeſt for <hi>fiſh</hi> he give thee a <hi>ſerpent.</hi> yet ſtill ſay, I will own him as a Father, honour him as a Father. <hi>Chriſt</hi> when he was in thoſe agonies, and deſtitute of all comfort, yet he did not refuſe to accompliſh the will of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>As God giveth comfort to believers, ſo he doth it proportionably and ſutably to their tryals, neceſſities and wants. Greater tryals</hi> need <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er comforts; greater temptations</hi> need <hi>greater conſolations.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle at the next verſe, <hi>As our ſufferings abound, ſo our conſolation alſo abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through Chriſt.</hi> One drop of honey is not enough to ſweeten the ſalt waters of the ſea; neither can ſmall conſolations equal great afflictions. Hence the wiſdome and goodneſs of God is moſt remarkable, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth his comforts for ſuch times and ſeaſons, when the ſoul doth moſt want them. Now if ever, the Lord muſt comfort; elſe they ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, as in the time of our firſt converſion to God, when our ſins lie with all their weight upon our backs; when we ſee nothing but terrour; which way ſoever we look; we are in ſtrong pangs and agonies of ſoul. The Devil alſo taketh his opportunity then to caſt in all his <hi>fiery darts.</hi> Thus when the ſoul of a man is filled with fear, doubts, ſeeing no way but hell and damnation, at ſuch a time God comes in with his beſt wine; then God delights to ſpeak to the heart of ſuch, <hi>Pſal. 94. 19. In the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my ſoul.</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifieth <hi>perplexed thoughts,</hi> like boughs on a tree intangled one with another, that a man cannot part them; ſuch were his thoughts, ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſo enfolded one within another, that he knew not what to reſolve on, what to determine, yet the <hi>comforts of God did refreſh his ſoul.</hi> Thus new converts have many times more <hi>comfort</hi> then ever they ſhall have all their life time, they needed them moſt then.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>When the people of God have any great props and ſupports of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy taken away from them, then commonly God comes in with more than ordinary comfort.</hi> This makes him to be ſtyled, <hi>The Father of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, and Judge of widows;</hi> ſuch who need help and comfort moſt. When <hi>David</hi> was in danger of loſing his life and Kingdom, and that by his unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rebellious ſonne <hi>Abſolom,</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi> reviled him, when he fled up and down with his Army, with aſhes on his head, weeping and wailing, as he went up the hill, yet even at that time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. he ſaith, <hi>God had put more gladneſſe into his heart, then they could have in their harveſt joy.</hi> So the Diſciples, when they were to be parted from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he was not to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48709:95"/>
preſent with them; upon this, how greatly did ſorrow fill their hearts? What ſhould the ſheep do without their Shepherd, the Chickens without their Hen? Yet ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe, John</hi> 16. Chriſt would ſend his <hi>Spirit</hi> a <hi>Comforter</hi> in his room. Thus you ſee Gods way, when he taketh away the <hi>comfort</hi> of an Husband, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Friend, he will be in ſtead of all theſe to us. Thoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which we thought would have broken our hearts, he made even joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, When God calleth his people to any <hi>high degrees of ſelf-denial,</hi> even to <hi>Martyrdome</hi> it felf, then as their <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> would ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; ſo alſo their <hi>joyes</hi> ond <hi>comforts</hi> will be above them. The <hi>Martyrs</hi> never felt ſuch <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in all their lives time, as they did in a dark dungeon, and in the flames of fire. Therefore Gods children ſhould not ſinfully torture their ſouls with thoughts: what if God ſhould call them out to ſuffer, to be impriſoned, to be burnt at the ſtake? Oh they ſhould deny Chriſt over and over again, prove wretched Apoſtates! They muſt not judge thus according to their preſent diſpoſition; but remember that God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion <hi>ſtrength and comfort</hi> to their exerciſes, and give them Giants ſtrength, if he lay a Giants burden on them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>God doth not only do good to his people in giving them joy, but to ſhew how ready and willing he is, the Scripture ſaith, That it is a joy to God to do any good for us, he rejoyceth to beſtow his mercy upon us.</hi> This is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after the manner of men, to denote with what willingneſſe he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth his favours to us. See what a wonderfull expreſſion the Prophet uſeth, <hi>Zephan.</hi> 3. 17. while God is ſaid to be <hi>in the midſt of his people, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them, even becauſe he doth thus;</hi> he is ſaid, <hi>To rejoyce over them with joy, to reſt in his love, and to joy over them with ſinging.</hi> By this we ſee, that while God giveth us grace, and other mercies, whereof joy is a chief one, he himſelf rejoyceth therein. Even as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth of a liberal man, <hi>That he takes more joy in giving, than he that receiveth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, can do in receiving of it.</hi> God then giveth thee grace and joy not unwillingly, not difficultly, but he himſelf <hi>rejoyceth</hi> in making thy heart <hi>joyfull.</hi> See a ſweet place to confirme this alſo, <hi>Iſai. 61. 5. At the Bridegroome rejoyceth over the Bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>This joy, God giveth believers, is a ſpiritual joy.</hi> Worldly joy is like the <hi>culinary</hi> fire which goeth out, if it have not daily fuell; but this is like the <hi>elementary,</hi> that needeth no <hi>pabulum,</hi> but continueth of it ſelf without ſuch additaments. Though friends die, though the creatures break under us, yet this joy abideth the ſame ſtill. It is a <hi>ſpiritual joy,</hi> becauſe ſeated in the <hi>ſpiritual part</hi> of a man moſt. So that we do not ſpeak here ſo much of a ſenſible bodily joy, but of that which is rational and ſeated in the ſoul. It is true, when the ſoul is greatly affected by way of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and redundancy, it doth overflow even to the bodily part of a man alſo; but the <hi>Subject,</hi> wherein this <hi>joy</hi> is immediately and properly ſeated, is in the <hi>ſoul and heart</hi> of a man. Hence it is that the <hi>heart</hi> is ſo often ſaid in the Scripture, <hi>To rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> which is the mind and the will. Therefore as a godly ſoul may truly repent, when yet it cannot ſhed bodily tears; ſo it may truly rejoyce, when it hath not a bodily gladneſſe upon it. So that as the Wiſeman ſaith of <hi>carnal laughter,</hi> that even in that, <hi>the heart may be ſad;</hi> So alſo, though in bodily ſadneſſe, yet the conſcience of a man may have great tranquillity and joy. It is alſo a <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy,</hi> becauſe the motives of it are chiefly from ſpiritual objects; It's <hi>joy in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>joy in the holy Ghoſt. Luke</hi> 10. 10. Our Saviour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48709:95"/>
his Diſciples, <hi>Not to rejoyce in that they could work miracles, and caſt out Devils, but becauſe their name was written in Heaven.</hi> It's <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> alſo in its <hi>operations.</hi> For whereas <hi>worldly joy</hi> enters into men, as the <hi>Devils</hi> did into the Swine, hurling them headlong into Hell. This makes the heart more active, more fruitfull; It's like the Spirit to <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s wings, like the wind that made the dry bones gather together and live. It's like <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s fiery chariot, mounting him up into Heaven; whereas grief and ſorrow are like the wormes that eat into the wood, and devour the ſtrength of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>This joy is given by God to believers, though formerly great and grievous ſinners.</hi> For we might think, ſuch as have been the chiefeſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands in ſinning and blaſpheming againſt God, though God ſhould have pity and mercy upon them, yet he ſhould never give them any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this life. You would think their former luſts, pride, uncleanneſſe, and exceſſe of riot, ſhould be like a mill-ſtone alwayes about their neck; They ſhould go mourning to the grave, never able to remove their ſinnes out of their ſight; but thinking they purſue them as cloſe every moment, as <hi>Aſahel</hi> did <hi>Joab</hi> to damn us: Yet even to ſuch, after God becomes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with them, God it may be giveth more comfort, than to others. Great ſinnes when repented of, cannot barre off great conſolations; and indeed, ſuch need ſtrong conſolations, for their great conflicts and agonies. If Chriſt put not both armes under them, they hardly keep from fainting away. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were in a ſpecial manner owned and comforted by Chriſt, though they had deeply wounded their ſouls with ſinne. We ſee <hi>Paul,</hi> though ſo notorious a wretch againſt Chriſt, yet when converted, God doth not upbraid him with former rebellions; but in the number of thoſe who have <hi>peace and joy,</hi> he reckons himſelf; and the truth is, ſuch are moſt humble, tender and melting under comforts. What (Lord) ſuch a beaſt, ſuch a Devil as I have comfort? What (Lord) I that might have been a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> crying out, <hi>My ſins are greater than I can bear?</hi> That like <hi>Dives</hi> might have begged for one drop of water to cool my ſcorching heat, but have been denied? Shall ſuch an one have <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation?</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How God will comfort his People in all both their ſpiritual and temporal Afflictions, which all the Art of Philoſophy can never do.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond particular in this Text hath been diſpatched, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> whom God comforteth <hi>[Us] Apoſtles and believers,</hi> in the general; ſuch onely have a right and intereſt comforts. Why ſuch onely have a right, will be treated on more opportunely in the procedure of the verſe.</p>
               <p>We therefore go forward to the third part of the Text, as it ſtands divided, and that is the <hi>Object matter</hi> wherein this comfort is communicated to us, and that is for the <hi>nature</hi> of it ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Tribulation;</hi> and for the <hi>extenſion</hi> of it, <hi>all tribulation. Tribulation]</hi> The Greek word ſignifieth, <hi>Such an affliction as doth even oppreſſe and ſqueeze a man, as it were:</hi> Hence it is tranſlated ſometimes <hi>perſecution,</hi> Act. 11. 19. The Churches <hi>afflictions</hi> are called <hi>perſecutions,</hi> to ſhew the voluntary, malicious endeavours of her enemies, who run up and down to ſeize on ſuch as belong to Chriſt; which implieth alſo, that the godly did not raſhly and ſinfully put themſelves into their enemies hands; but that according to Chriſts command they did flee, when their adverſaries ſought for them. And this may be done in <hi>faith,</hi> not in ſinfull <hi>fear,</hi> as appeareth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. where ſome are ſaid to <hi>hide themſelves in caves and holes,</hi> yet by <hi>faith.</hi> But the word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly rendred <hi>tribulation,</hi> having ſometimes the epithete <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> added to it, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 21. And the Latine word <hi>tribulation</hi> anſwers the Greek well, which (ſay ſome) comes from the <hi>flail of the threſher,</hi> that bruiſeth the corn: Or (as others) from <hi>thiſtles</hi> that are ſharp and vexing. Well, the word ſignifieth ſuch a <hi>tribulation, as is bruiſing, pricking, ſadly moleſting:</hi> Yet as out of the ſame root cometh the ſweet Roſe, as well as the ſharp prickles, ſo from the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhall ariſe joy as well as grief. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there is no tribulation, or affliction Gods people can fall into, but God will comfort them therein.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Text ſaith, <hi>all tribulation,</hi> let it be what it will be. Do not ſay, Every tribulation but mine; Take heed of thinking thy dungeon is ſo dark, that no ray or beam of this Sunne can come unto thee. For as <hi>Paul</hi> argueth in another caſe, <hi>Heb. 2. 8. In that all things are put under ſubjection to Chriſt, it is manifeſt he left nothing that is not put under him.</hi> So in that God comforteth <hi>in all tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it is manifeſt, that there is no <hi>tribulation</hi> exempted, or left out. Take heed of that prophane Queſtion, <hi>Is God the God of the hils, as well as of the valleys?</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:48709:96"/>
Think not that God is limited, ſo as if there were ſome kind of <hi>water</hi> that he cannot turn into <hi>wine;</hi> ſome <hi>ſtones</hi> that he cannot convert into <hi>bread.</hi> But let us explain this. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God doth comfort his people in all tribulations, for the ſeveral kinds of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Propoſitions explaining the Obſervation.</note> 
                  <hi>them.</hi> The tribulations that may fall upon the people of God are of ſuch differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſorts, that it is very difficult to number them, as it is the ſand upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore; yet we may divide them into theſe two ſorts, The <hi>ſoul-troubles</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or <hi>ſpiritual ones;</hi> and the <hi>external,</hi> or <hi>temporal ones,</hi> In both theſe God will not leave his people comfortleſs. Their <hi>ſpiritual troubles,</hi> they may empty themſelves into ſeveral chanels. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a ſoul-trouble ariſing in the heart, becauſe of Gods displeaſure for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Several ſorts of ſoul or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual troubles, in all which God comforts his children.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinne.</hi> This trouble <hi>David</hi> doth ſadly groan under many times, and this is the greateſt evil that the godly can grapple with. When God hideth his face from <hi>David,</hi> it's neither his Kingdom, or ſucceſs, or any great proſperity he hath, that can be ſo much as a drop of water to cool his thirſty ſcorched ſoul. <hi>Job</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was in this troubled condition, when he complaineth, <hi>That the arrows of the Almighty did ſtick in him.</hi> What comfort or joy could <hi>Job</hi> find in any thing in the world, while God was thus frowning on him? So that the ſoul in this caſe is moſt remote from comfort. Bring him riches, honours, you do but as they that gave vinegar and gall to Chriſt for to drink, you increaſe ſorrow more: yet at laſt we find both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> were comforted; God could and did of that chaos and dark confuſion they felt within them, work much light and joy. And certainly, if there be any of Gods children that live and die without comfort, having no evidence or aſſurance of Gods favour; this is not becauſe God cannot comfort, or becauſe God is not gracious and pitifull to ſuch, but becauſe God ſeeth it beſt not to give comfort to ſuch. Seeing therefore it's God that break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart, it's he that makes the ſoul tremble, it is he that convinceth of ſin, and humbleth the ſoul under it: So it is the ſame God only that can command <hi>comforts;</hi> when he ſpeaketh the word, all ſorrow and tormenting fears ſhall flie away, as dark miſts before the glorious light of the Sun. Oh then, let ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and overwhelmed ſouls remember the Omnipotency of God in comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as in other things! Say, O Lord, my heart would break and break again, if I had nothing but men or Angels to <hi>comfort;</hi> but I have to do with thee who art the <hi>Father of ſpirits,</hi> and ſo canſt put into the ſoul <hi>gladneſſe of heart,</hi> as well as grace.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſpiritual trouble is, <hi>The want of that ſanctifying and mortifying pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they deſire againſt their luſts.</hi> They find the reliques of corruption too preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; their hearts are not in their own power; They complain and ſay, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my <hi>hands,</hi> and they move as I would have them; I ſtirre my <hi>feet,</hi> and they obey preſently; but when I charge my <hi>ſoul</hi> to be heavenly, believing, to be chearfull, patient, it doth not at all yeeld to me. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. did in a moſt pathetical manner complain of this conflict and agony with him, <hi>The evil he would not do, that he did.</hi> As theſe impetuous luſts are a burden, ſo the deadneſs, barrenneſs and hardneſs of his heart: Oh often doth he cry out of his ſoul, as like the mountains of <hi>Gilboa,</hi> on whom no dew doth fall, like a parched and dried wilderneſs, and he knoweth not how to come out of it, yet even in theſe ſad, perplexed thoughts God comes in with comfort, when his heart affords none, when all within riſeth up againſt him; yet as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> his complaints ſhall be turned into praiſes, <hi>I thank God in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third <hi>Soul-tribulation</hi> may be <hi>from Satans temptations:</hi> He is called the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,</hi> he is ſaid to have his <hi>fiery darts,</hi> he hath his <hi>buffetings.</hi> We ſee how fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he aſſaulted <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; and as for the <hi>inceſtuous perſon</hi> by <hi>Satans devices,</hi> he was almoſt ſwallowed up with ſorrow. And indeed, what horrid ſuggeſtions of blaſphemy, ſelf-murder, and whatſoever is moſt terrible and amazing, will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48709:97"/>
not he aſſault the godly ſoul with, if God bind him not up. Well doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture compare him to a <hi>a roaring Lion;</hi> what can a poor <hi>Lamb</hi> do, if he fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? And truly no more could the poor humbled ſinner ſtand before all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations and oppoſitions of <hi>Satan,</hi> if Gods grace did not interpoſe; yet even in this helliſh darkneſs, when the ſoul is apt to judge its condition, like thoſe that are damned in hell; when he is ready to conclude, God hath forſaken him for ever, that the expreſs ſigns and characters of a caſt-away are upon him, as he thinketh, yet of this Whales-belly, from the mouth of hell, God doth raiſe him, and give him <hi>comfort;</hi> yea many times thoſe have the greateſt <hi>comforts,</hi> that have the greateſt exerciſes of this kind; and therefore the Lord did leave them in this black night, that the day might be the ſweeter and more welcome.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Souls-trouble may ariſe from the breaches it hath made by Apoſtaſie, and falling into great ſins after it hath known God.</hi> And theſe commonly do give a mortal blow to all our former comfort. You ſee it in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. when he complaineth of his <hi>broken bones,</hi> praying <hi>to have joy reſtored to him.</hi> Some have thought that <hi>David</hi> never had ſuch comfort again as formerly. Certainly the godly in ſuch fals ſinne hainouſly, becauſe of the experience they have of Gods favour, and the bitterneſs of ſinne, therefore for them to revolt from God is an high aggravation: As if the <hi>Prodigal ſon,</hi> after he had been entertained in his Fathers houſe, and feaſted with the fatted calf, ſhould have gone to his husks again, how intollerable would that have been? Well, but for all this, this ſad condition of a <hi>gradual Apoſtate,</hi> and revolter, is not without ground of comfort, when truly humbled and debaſed before God. Doth not God ſpeak graciouſly, <hi>Jer. 3. 22. Return ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings?</hi> And ſee how this mercifull offer is imbraced, <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> She pleadeth her intereſt and right to God howſoever. Thus alſo God promiſeth, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 4. Ile heal their backsliding.</hi> So that although when the conſcience hath been the ſecond time bruiſed; when thou haſt been twice as it were in the new birth, thou muſt look for greater pains and agonies, yet God can, and doth <hi>comfort</hi> ſuch alſo. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>joy unspeakable, and full of glory,</hi> which the people of God have, though he had greatly revolted from Chriſt his maſter. So that manna may be had in this wilderneſs alſo.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of troubles are <hi>outward,</hi> and theſe are alſo innumerable, <hi>Act. 14. 22. We muſt through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> We <note place="margin">How God comforteth his people in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> muſt expect like Chriſt to be <hi>men of ſorrows:</hi> for we are to ſuffer with him, if we will reign with him. Now two ſorts of <hi>troubles</hi> there are in which God will give <hi>comfort,</hi> and in them all troubles are comprehended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There are troubles, ſuch as we bring upon our ſelves by our own folly and ſins.</hi> We have provoked God to be angry, and to take away many outward mercies from us. Now becauſe our ſins, and our iniquities have done all this, therefore it is that we may juſtly expect that God will deny all <hi>comfort.</hi> We might think it is true, when we ſuffer for Gods ſake, when we are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, then Chriſt will take us into his <hi>wine-ſellar,</hi> and bid us, <hi>Drink abundantly.</hi> But it is my vile heart, my proud heart, my looſe and negligent walking that hath brought all this evil upon me, and what comfort then can I expect from God? But even in this condition, ſuch is the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of God, that although our ſins have brought evil upon us, yet if humbled under them, and bewailing of them, we ſhall find God for to <hi>comfort</hi> us. When <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4. had that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing joy which he ſaith, <hi>God put into his heart,</hi> more than <hi>all harveſt joy,</hi> yet he was at that time in very ſad exigencies, purſued by his ſon, and driven out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and this God threatned as the fruit of his ſinne; but behold all this, God giveth him comfort: And the truth is, when humbled for our ſinnes, then the nature of theſe afflictions are altered, they become <hi>paternal</hi> and <hi>medicinal chaſtiſements,</hi> they are arguments of Gods love to us; we may rejoyce in them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48709:97"/>
as teſtimonies thereof; for ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. it is ſaid, <hi>Whom God loveth he chaſteneth.</hi> God makes as the Phyſician an excellent antidote of that which is poiſon, and ſo the fruit of thy ſins becometh great matter of thankfulneſs, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledged, when he ſaid, <hi>Out of very thankefulneſs thou haſt afflicted me.</hi> And as for the ſecond kind of afflictions, which are only for the exerciſe of graces, when we are perſecuted not for the evil in us, but the good appearing, as the caſe of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> was; then God giveth us <hi>comfort</hi> with full meaſure, preſſed down, and yet flowing over; witneſs the <hi>Apoſtles, who went away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, becauſe they were accounted worthy to ſuffer all things for Chriſts ſake.</hi> The <hi>Martyrs</hi> alſo had more joy in their troubles then ever they had in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and it is of thoſe tribulations the Scripture ſpeaketh of. Indeed ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have eſſayed upon ſuch a comfort, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> ſaid, <hi>If a wiſe man were burnt in</hi> Phalaris <hi>his Bull, he would ſay,</hi> Dulce eſt, &amp; ad me nihil pertinet, <hi>This is a ſweet thing, and doth not at all hurt me.</hi> But theſe were Book ſayings. No <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ever endured miſery for their Sects, as <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have done for the truth of Chriſt. But you may ſay, What is that by which God comforts his people in all their tribulations? Hath the Scripture any higher grounds than <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy? Philoſophy</hi> is called <hi>animi medicina;</hi> and as there were ſeveral Sects of them, ſo they had different principles to comfort; for there was no theam treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on more by them than this; only ſome principles were contrary to others; for ſome perſwaded this as a ſpecial help to premeditate on evils before they came. Others they refuſed this, as making a man miſerable before he was ſo. Others ſupported themſelves with the thoughts of neceſſity, and that it could not be otherwiſe. But of all theſe we may ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> to his friends, <hi>Ye are miſerable comforters,</hi> and are of no more advantage then the rending of garments, or pulling off the hair in grief, which <hi>Bion</hi> derided in one, as if a bald head would take away grief. We therefore conclude, <hi>That no Philoſophers had the true art</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">No Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ever had the true grounds of comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>or grounds of comfort,</hi> and that</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe they were wholly ignorant of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom alone is all the cauſe of comfort.</hi> Therefore he is called <hi>our Peace,</hi> and he is ſaid to be the <hi>Prince of peace. Foeliciſſimum eſt cui non eſt opus foelicitate,</hi> and ſuch an one is the man in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for he will never thirſt more than hath drunk of that fountain. No ſinne, no guilt, no curſe can be removed, but <hi>by the bloud of Chriſt.</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all their <hi>Philoſophical</hi> precepts about comfort were as the influence of the Moon, which doth rather rotten than ripen in reſpect of the Sunnes influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They were without the Spirit of Christ the efficient cauſe of comfort. Chriſt</hi> is the ſubject matter in whom alone we can have comfort; and the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is the efficient cauſe that doth alone give a comfortable and glad heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They were altogether unbelieving of a Reſurrection to leternal glory, which is an admirable ground of all true joy.</hi> This the Apoſtle preſſeth againſt immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſorrow about thoſe that are dead, <hi>Not to grieve as thoſe that are without hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>They were wholly unacquainted with the life of faith, that is only inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to receive joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation,</hi> in all thy tribulations <hi>to look up to God in Chriſt for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Thou runneſt to this creature to comfort, and thou thinkeſt this and that condition would comfort thee; but how can the chanel have any thing in it, if the fountain doth not give it?

               <argument>
                  <p>What are theſe Apples which Chriſt refreſheth his Spouſe with? Or what are thoſe Scripture-grounds of comfort, which ſupport the hearts of Gods children under all their afflictions?</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 4.</bibl>
                  <q>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THere is no <hi>tribulation</hi> either for the kind or degree of it, but God can and doth <hi>comfort</hi> his people therein. It is therefore requiſite to know what are thoſe cordial comforts, what is that balm and oyl by which he healeth the wounds of his afflicted ones. For ſeeing Gods comforts do farre exceed all <hi>Philoſophical</hi> remedies, as much as the <hi>Sunne</hi> doth a <hi>Gloworm:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi>'s admirable temperament, <hi>I know how to abound, and how to want,</hi> doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely tranſcend that ſo much celebrated carriage of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who was noted to be alwayes <hi>Eodem vultu,</hi> let whatſoever befall him. It is very uſefull to know, <note place="margin">Gods children deficient in a two-fold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods comforts.</note> what are theſe <hi>Apples of comfort,</hi> as the Church calleth for, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 5. And the rather this is to be done, becauſe many of Gods children are deficient in a three-fold reſpect about Gods conſolations. For either</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They are in a great manner ignorant of what foundations and ſure grounds they have of comfort.</hi> They do not know what fountains of living water they may abundantly bathe themſelves in. They are as <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant, who though there was a great hoſt of <hi>Angels</hi> to help him, yet he did not ſee them. So that the Spirit of God doth not only illuminate us in the matter of duty, but alſo in matter of comfort; hence he is called, <hi>The Comforter.</hi> Or</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Though they know many arguments of comfort, yet their memory faileth them,</hi> that in the very hour of their temptations, in the midſt of their furious aſſaults, they forget what comfortable ſupports they might make uſe of. So that it is good to preach of theſe principles of conſolation, that thereby we may be remembrancers to you, and put you in mind of that joy, which in the midſt of your afflictions, your corruptions, and the Devils temptations are ſo apt to ſtrike out. As the Diſciples were ſometimes blamed for their forgetfulneſs, they did not remember the <hi>miracle of loaves.</hi> Thus alſo the children of God, may often rebuke themſelves, and with <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Why waſt thou caſt down, O my ſoul? And why waſt thou ſo troubled within thee?</hi> Hadſt thou thought on ſuch a promiſe, ſuch a place of Scripture? Hadſt thou remembred ſuch a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſweet truth, the temptation had not prevailed ſo much upon thee. <note place="margin">What are theſe good things that God hath prepared for thoſe that love him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Come we then to lead you up into the Mount of transfiguration, let us ſee even in this life, as farre as our narrow hearts can comprehend, <hi>What are the good things God hath prepared for thoſe that love him?</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, Take this for a foundation, <hi>That God comforts only through and by the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48709:98"/>
Scriptures.</hi> He muſt enter into this pool, that will feel theſe conſolations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending upon him, he muſt buy this field of the Scriptures, that will have this pearl hidden there. <hi>The Spirit of God</hi> is that indeed which doth efficiently reach to the ſoul, and make it to receive comfort; but the means by which, or the harp (as it were) whereby the evil ſpirit of ſorrow and dejection is removed, is by the word of God: So that as the Spirit of God doth powerfully change and alter the heart yet the word is organically and inſtrumentally uſed for that end. So though the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> be the <hi>Comforter,</hi> yet it is through the Word. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 15. 4. That we through comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> doth not only admire the word of God, becauſe it fore-warneth of ſinne, quickeneth up to duty, but alſo becauſe it was a reviving, comforting Word, whereby he was kept from fainting, and being utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in his troubles. And this is the more to be conſidered by the godly, that ſo they may not be deluded by falſe joyes. When the Devil is ſaid to <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 14. that is, into light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as well as of truth, There are <hi>falſe joyes,</hi> there are <hi>comforts</hi> from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as well as doctrines of the Devil. The <hi>Papist</hi> hath his comforts. The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,</hi> the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> all theſe have a ſpirit of deluſion in their joyes, as well as in their opinion. The Spirit of God doth firſt lead into <hi>truth,</hi> before it vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth <hi>comfort.</hi> But we detain you too long.</p>
               <p>The firſt ground therefore of Scripture, that may be had out of the treaſury <note place="margin">What grounds of comfort the Scriptures afford un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</note> thereof, is this, <hi>viz. That all the tribulations we fall into, they are preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God as a Father out of much love, both in regard of the beginning of them, the degree of them, as alſo the continuance of them.</hi> And if this truth be well rumiated and digeſted, here is matter of comfort enough; here is more oyl then we have veſſels to receive. This the Scripture doth frequently inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, <hi>Matth. 5. Your heavenly Father knoweth what you have need of.</hi> But eſpecially <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9, 10. the Apoſtle declareth at large, That <hi>becauſe we are ſons, becauſe God loveth us, and is a Father, therefore he doth chasten us;</hi> and ſo if we give reverence to earthly parents, becauſe they correct us, as the Apoſtle implieth, How much more ought we to bleſs God for his fatherly love to us in correcting of us? <hi>Out of very faithfulneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, thou hast afflicted me, for before that came, he went aſtray.</hi> So then, he who is taught by Scripture, he ſeeth as much of love, as much of a Father in theſe tribulations, as in any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies. Whereas therefore they ſaid, <hi>If thou art the Sonne of God come down from the croſſe:</hi> the godly man ſaith on the contrary, becauſe he is the Son of God, he will aſcend up to the Croſs, when his Father commands him: hence afflictions are ſpoken of by way of gift, <hi>To you it is given to ſuffer;</hi> and they are called, <hi>The precious trial of our faith.</hi> Say then as Chriſt, <hi>Shall I not drink of the Cup which my Father hath given me?</hi> And becauſe he is a Father, and he makes his afflictions medicinal, therefore they are ſtinted and meaſured by him, both for the time, when they ſhall begin, thy tribulations fall not out when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and thy enemies would bring them upon thee; but when Gods time is come, as you ſee they could never touch Chriſt, till he ſaid, <hi>His time was come.</hi> So that as God is ſaid to determine the bounds of mens habitations, ſo he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the afflictions of his children; they come not ſooner or later than thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in wiſdome had appointed. Now as winter and cold is neceſſary in its ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as Summer in its ſeaſon, and the night hath its uſe as well as the day: Thus a time of <hi>tribulation</hi> is as neceſſary, as a time of reſt and quietneſs. There is a great deal of mercy to thee in the very time of thy trouble; unleſs the grain of Corn fall in the earth and die, it cannot be fruitfull; this Chriſt applied to himſelf, and is alſo true of every Chriſtian. As the time is thus prefixed, ſo the kind of it, with the <hi>meaſure and degree of it.</hi> Revel. 2. 10. <hi>The Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſpeaketh of the ſeveral ſorts
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48709:99"/>
of tribulations the Saints were exerciſed with; and if <hi>Gods providence</hi> reacheth to the <hi>Sparrows fall on the ground,</hi> yea to the <hi>hair falling from the head,</hi> how much more to the head it ſelf, to man himſelf? Is not this then a true ſolid ground of comfort, to think that thy heavenly Father knowing thy temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and what will do thee moſt good, hath appointed thee to drink of this cup of an affliction, rather than another? Know, that that very tryal upon thee, how contrary ſoever to thy fleſh and bloud, yet is the beſt and moſt profitable affliction of any in the world to thee: other afflictions would be like contrary phyſick to a diſeaſe, do more hurt than good.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This heaveuly Father hath not only appointed the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>kind,</hi> the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of thy tribulation, but alſo the <hi>time of deliverance from it.</hi> And this is alſo a great comfort to know, that the tribulation ſhall not ſtay an hour longer, then while it may do good to thee; he will not take one drop of blood more from thee then is neceſſary to prevent thy diſeaſe, or abate it. So <hi>Rev. 2. 10. Some ſhould be cast into priſon for ten dayes.</hi> You ſee here God had determined the time. Even as the <hi>Artificer</hi> knoweth how long the gold muſt be in the fire, to take away the droſſe, and will not ſuffer it to abide any longer. This the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> made uſe of in his Prayer for the Church, <hi>The time to favour her, yea the ſet time is come.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 102. 13.</note> So thou art to know, that the time of favour, the time of deliverance, yea the ſet time will come. So that this may adde much comfort to the godly, that their afflictions ſhall be as the horſleeches ſet to the body, to ſtick no longer then the corrupt bloud is taken away. Thus <hi>Job</hi> though he had many gloomy and ſad temptations, yet ſometimes again he was refreſhed with this, <hi>That he ſhould come out of that affliction, like gold out of the fire,</hi> Chap. 23. 10. How wonderfully was <hi>Habakkuk</hi> comforted in his exerciſes? for being informed, <hi>Chap. 2. 3. That the viſion was for an appointed time,</hi> that God though he did tarry would ſurely come, ſee how he breaketh forth, <hi>Chap. 3. 17, 18. Although the fig-tree doth not bloſſom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet I will rejoyce in God, I will joy in the God of my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Well may God be called <hi>the God of conſolation,</hi> who can make <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſo greatly rejoyce, when all earthly props are taken away.</p>
               <p>A ſecond <hi>Scripture-cordial, by which God comforts his people in all tribulations, is from Chriſt, with all the fulneſs that is in him.</hi> Certainly <hi>Christ</hi> received by faith, and improved Evangelically, is able to make us gather grapes of thorns, and figs of thiſtles: He that hath this Sunne cannot be in the dark night: What makes <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. ſo triumph and boaſt in all manner of tribulations, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging (as it were) every one of them to do their worſe? Is not the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all this, <hi>Christ dead, and Christ riſen again? And if he hath given us Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi> Thus the preſence of Chriſt, the ſpiritual influence of Chriſt into the ſoul, taketh away the bitterneſſe of all troubles. Thus it was with the <hi>Martyrs:</hi> Thus it is with Gods children, while by faith they lay hold on Chriſt. As the light of the Sunne puts out the light of the fire: Thus the preſence of Chriſt, putteth out all other comforts, yea and all troubles alſo. Hence <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. Chriſt is promiſed to the godly by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them, when the outward condition of the Nation was like to be very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. <hi>Micah</hi> alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 5. promiſeth, that <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould be the <hi>peace,</hi> when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould come into the Land. But what Peace was Chriſt, he did not bring temporal peace, neither was he to have a temporal Kingdom? But to the godly, who looked for a ſpiritual <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> this was the <hi>comfort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> to have a Chriſt as a ſpiritual Saviour. If then thy tribulations be heavy, and irkſome; Oh deſire more knowledge and enjoyment of Chriſt, for he will be in ſtead of all things to thee; he is Wiſdome, he is Righteouſneſſe, he is wealth, he is honours, he is husband, friend: So that he who hath fellowſhip and communion with Chriſt, finds him to be, as thoſe <hi>three Worthies</hi> caſt into the fiery fornace, having the company of one, who is ſaid <hi>to be in form like the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48709:99"/>
Sonne of God;</hi> a defence againſt the rage of the fire, ſo that the very garments did not ſo much as ſmell of any burning. Thus the preſence of Chriſt hach ſo wonderfully raviſhed and refreſhed the heart of an afficted afflicted Saint, that he hath almoſt forgot his affliction, and diſcovereth not the leaſt ſoil from it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Another Scripture diſcovery for comfort, is to preſſe and command the life of faith upon Gods promiſe.</hi> So that whatſoever the principles of the world and ſenſe do ſuggeſt, yet faith rectifieth all: That finds honey to come out of a dead Lion; that can ſuck honey from a bitter herb, when fleſhly wiſdom, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon can go no further, yet even then faith can gather ſure and firm ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of comfort. <hi>David</hi> in that great diſtreſſe at <hi>Ziklag,</hi> yet is ſaid <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage himſelf in his God. Paul</hi> maketh this the ground of a Chriſtians magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, ſupport and joy uuder all tribulations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Becauſe <hi>faith is the ſubstance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Gods thoughts and our thoughts are wholly different, only <hi>faith</hi> inableth us to know the mind of God; and where fleſh is ready to ſay, God is caſting off, and utterly forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, there faith ſeeth him drawing near. The Diſciples in a tempeſt thought they had ſeen a Spirit, and were affrighted, but it was Chriſt. The promiſe of God and faith applying it, do bear up the ſoul, and make it rejoyce in troubles. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. we have there Gods promiſe, and Gods oath alſo to confirm it, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We have thoſe two immutable things, that we might have ſtrong conſolation.</hi> See there, becauſe of Gods promiſe, and that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by an Oath: We have a <hi>conſolation,</hi> and a <hi>ſtrong conſolation; Strong,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ground of it is <hi>ſtrong, Gods</hi> Word, ſo that it is ſtronger than moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, it is ſtronger than Heaven and earth: Every creature ſhall fall to the ground rather than the promiſe not be made good to thee. Again, it is a <hi>ſtrong conſolation,</hi> becauſe neither the Devils nor his inſtruments ſhall be able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. Though therefore thy enemies be ſtrong enemies: though thy troubles are ſtrong troubles, yet remember here is a <hi>ſtrong conſolation;</hi> death it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deprive thee of it: if then <hi>we walk by faith, and not by ſenſe;</hi> if we live upon theſe breſts of conſolation, as the Infant doth, ſurely we may then ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down even deadly and poiſonous things, yet they ſhall not do any hurt: Becauſe the promiſe is the ſame, thy heart would alwayes be the fame, as the Law is written in thy heart in reſpect of obedience; ſo let the promiſe in reſpect of faith: Faith from the Word doth ſhew carnal reaſon, all the miſtakes and falſe principles it proceedeth upon, diſcovering light in darkneſſe, love in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and life even in death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, (For theſe bunches of grapes may ſerve to acquaint you what the Land is) <hi>eternal glory to be poſſeſſed after the troubles, vexations and exerciſes here, is able to make the heart to be exceeding glad under all our troubles.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16, 17. We faint not, for this light affliction worketh for us a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi> and this is <hi>by looking not on the things that are ſeen, but the things that are not ſeen.</hi> At another time the godly are commanded to <hi>lift up their heads when the day of judgment draweth nigh, becauſe their redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is at hand.</hi> And 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 18. after a diſcourſe of our Lords coming, and that the godly ſhall be ever with him, they are enjoyned, <hi>To comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe things;</hi> that incomprehenſible glory which is provided for us to receive after our ſufferings here, makes the heart rejoyce, while it is in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of tears; this Haven after our ſtorms; this reſt after our troubles; this Crown after our warfare, is that which reviveth the ſoul, and makes it a <hi>Naomi,</hi> while it is a <hi>Marah.</hi>

It is this, <hi>Seeing</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaketh thus generally,</hi> God comforteth us in all our tribulations, <hi>doth not this neceſſarily infer, that all the children of God in all ſtraits are full of</hi> comfort? <hi>And if this be ſo, either we muſt condemn many, who in all appearance are the dear children of God, for hypocrites and unſound, becauſe they have no comfort: Yea all divine means have been uſed, and yet they cannot be comforted, or elſe we must question the truth of this Scripture. This Text ſaith,</hi> God comforteth his in all their tribulations: <hi>Experience telleth us, That many of Gods children are ſadly diſconſolate, or elſe if their want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort be an argument, they do not belong to God, we ſhall then paſſe an uncharitable cenſure upon thoſe who are every way to be accounted of as precious Saints, and that of the first magnitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore remove this ſtumbling block out of the way. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It cannot be denied, but that it may be the caſe, not only of a godly perſon, but even an whole Church, to be without all comfort, that nothing but ſorrow and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How God comforreth his children in all their tribulations, though they often may be diſconſolate.</note> 
                  <hi>trouble do even devour them all the day long.</hi> See this true in <hi>Jeremiahs Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Chap. 1. 2. Chap. 2. 20, 21. The Church there ſits in mourning, with tears on her cheeks, and ſhe hath <hi>none to comfort her,</hi> neither God or man. And for a particular perſon, what is clearer than <hi>Job,</hi> whoſe ſoul was as full of ſpiritual botches and ſores by ſad thoughts, as his body was of corporal ones, <hi>Job 17. 13. When I ſaid my bed ſhall comfort, thou skareſt me with dreams,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> not in his bed a place of reſt, nor in the night a time of reſt, can be freed from terrors and fears: yea <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 27. when he ſaid, <hi>I will leave off my heavineſſe, I will comfort my ſelf;</hi> when he ſet himſelf with all holy endeavours to caſt off this viper of ſorrow, yet they did rather increaſe upon him: Yea, when he himſelf cannot remove thoſe mountains of his heart, it may be his godly friends may, and indeed ſuch ſpiritual Phyſicians God doth ſometimes bleſſe for that end: But <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 34. he telleth them, <hi>They comfort him in vain;</hi> none then can deny, but there was a time at leaſt, when God did not comfort <hi>Job</hi> in his tribulations. We read alſo of <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88. 15. who complaineth, <hi>That he was distracted with the terrors of the Lord from his youth up;</hi> he complaineth, <hi>Gods wrath lay hard upon him; that God did afflict him with all his ways;</hi> yea he prayed, he cried, and God <hi>did hide his face from him.</hi> So that in all the <hi>Pſalms</hi> there is not a word of comfort, no nor of hope or of confidence, which yet <hi>David</hi> in every <hi>Pſalm</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, though never ſo caſt down, doth in ſome degrees and ſparks (as it were) diſcover, but here is nothing but diſconſolateneſs; yet this <hi>Heman</hi> was a godly
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48709:100"/>
man, a Penman of ſome <hi>Pſalms;</hi> yea he was accounted one of the moſt eminent wiſe men that lived in that age; for 1 <hi>King. 4. 30, 31. Solomons</hi> wiſdom is ſaid to exceed all others; yea four wiſe men are inſtanced, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſurpaſs, and this <hi>Heman</hi> was one. Whereas then, we are apt to judge ſuch as want the ſenſe of Gods comfort, and go in a diſconſolate manner, fools and melancholly, ſuch as will go out of their wits: You ſee here a godly man, and one of the wiſeſt men in <hi>Solomons</hi> times, yet afflicted with the terrors of the Lord, and can obtain no comfort. This then being laid down as a foundation, let us conſider what is to be ſaid to the doubt. To anſwer the Objection, you muſt know in what ſenſe this is a doctrinal truth, <hi>That God comforteth his in all their troubles,</hi> and to that purpoſe obſerve theſe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That comfort, especially when we are ſenſibly affected and enlarged therewith,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Comfort not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> 
                  <hi>is not of the eſſence of grace, nor is it abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> It is indeed for the <hi>benè eſſe,</hi> and is like oil to the wheels, it doth wonderfully quicken and expedite the ſoul in wayes of holineſs; but yet a man may be in the ſtate of grace, and may have an unqueſtionable claim to Heaven, yet for all that be deſtitute of ſuch ſenſible comfort, for theſe conſolations do commonly flow from aſſurance of Gods grace, and the ſenſe of his love ſhed abroad in their hearts. Now it is not this aſſurance that doth juſtifie us, but it ſuppoſeth us juſtified already; we may reſt on Chriſt, we may believe on him, and yet want this <hi>faith of evidence,</hi> as ſome call it, while we have the <hi>faith of adherence</hi> and <hi>dependance.</hi> Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this comfort is not an inſeparable quality from a godly man, we muſt then underſtand the promiſes of God for comfort, as we do of other things which are ſeparable from true grace. God promiſeth health, outward peace, long life, yea of all outward mercies, godlineſs hath a promiſe, but yet the godly do not alwayes partake of theſe; there are many of them ſick, weak, poor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, though under ſuch promiſes: And the reaſon is, becauſe theſe are <hi>not neceſſary to ſalvation:</hi> They are not required as Chriſt and grace is, for then no godly man ſhould be without them; yea they may be an impediment, an hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and therefore it's a mercy ſometimes when God denieth them. Thus it is in regard of our comforts, it is for our good to be ſometimes without them, God in much mercy ſuffereth his people to be in darkneſſe, and to have no light. So that you may no more wonder to ſee them ſometimes without joy, then to ſee them ſometimes without the outward mercies of the world: Yet you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, when I thus compare theſe ſoul-conſolations to bodily ones, that I make them not of the ſame nature with temporal outward mercies, as if they were no <hi>more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> than wealth, or health are: No, I do not compare them in their nature, but in their property of ſeparability; they neither are of the eſſence of grace, nor of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to ſalvation, and herein they are alike: otherwiſe theſe conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they are <hi>ſpiritual</hi> mercies ſeated in the ſoul, and have intimate connexion with the graces of Gods Spirit. <hi>Gerſon</hi> calls them <hi>Gratiae gratis datae,</hi> and indeed they are the gifts of Gods Spirit, and are highly to be prized, yet as degrees in grace are of Gods Spirit, but not neceſſary to ſalvation; the <hi>truth of grace</hi> is, but not <hi>every degree of grace,</hi> for then no godly man could be ſaved that is weak in faith, and in other graces. Thus it is with this comfort in ſome reſpect, <hi>They are gifts of God,</hi> they are wrought by his Spirit, yet ſo as that they do not neceſſarily accompany our ſalvation, and in this ſenſe you muſt underſtand the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a two-fold joy, which I may call a direct and reflex one:</hi> The one is <note place="margin">There is a two-fold joy, direct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex.</note> when we are carried with delight to that which is holy and good. The other is, when we know and feel that we are thus carried out, joy is a fruit of faith, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. In whom believing ye rejoyce with joy unspeakable.</hi> Now as <hi>faith</hi> acteth two wayes, ſo alſo doth <hi>joy. Faith</hi> acteth <hi>directly</hi> by going directly to Chriſt; and then <hi>faith</hi> acts <hi>reflexly,</hi> by looking upon this, that I do reſt on Chriſt. Thus there is a joy that doth directly go to God and Chriſt by way of delight and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48709:101"/>
being thus apprehended by faith. Of ſuch a joy in holy things <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 15. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 64. 5. And then there is a <hi>joy</hi> flowing from the apprehenſion of this, that we do delight in holy things. For a man may rejoyce to find he can rejoyce in what is good; a man may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in finding that Chriſt and heavenly objects, are matter of delight to him. Now as it is with thoſe two acts of <hi>faith,</hi> the former, which is the <hi>direct</hi> one, that is abſolutely neceſſary, by that we are juſtified, by that Chriſt is made ours, by that we are in him, and he in us; but the latter is not of the ſame neceſſity. It is no where ſaid, If ye know that ye do believe, and if ye be aſſured that ye do believe, but if <hi>ye do believe, then ye ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It would be ſad with many of Gods children, if none were juſtified, but he that knoweth he believeth. Thus it is alſo for <hi>joy, joy</hi> in its direct acts, it's a neceſſary grace. It is our duty to rejoyce in God and heavenly things, as well as love them. And indeed there cannot be any <hi>grace of love,</hi> but there is alſo the <hi>grace of joy.</hi> Hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. joy is made the fruit of the Spirit, with other graces. And <hi>Rom. 14. The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is ſaid <hi>to conſiſt in righteouſneſs, and in joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> So that there is a <hi>joy,</hi> which being a grace, is part of the new creature, and there cannot be godlineſs without it; as is our love, ſo is our joy. But then there is <hi>joy</hi> as a priviledge, which (as you heard) ariſeth from the knowledge of our being in the ſtate of grace, and this is communicable at Gods pleaſure. Thoſe that have the moſt of Gods grace, may for a time have the leaſt of it in ſenſe, as we ſee in Chriſt himſelf. So that we are to diſtinguiſh between joy as a <hi>grace,</hi> and joy as a <hi>priviledge.</hi> It's of the latter the Doctrine is to be underſtood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet further, <hi>The joy that Gods people partake of, may be conſidered either as</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joy is either ſpiritual, or ſenſitive and corporeal.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeated in the ſoul, or as in the ſenſitive part.</hi> The one is <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> The other is <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>corporeal.</hi> For the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> they ſay, That as there are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſeated in the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> part, which are called fear, joy, grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo they make ſome things anſwerable to theſe in the miniſterial ſubſtances. For, it may ſeem, the ſoul when ſeparated from the body doth love joy, yea and Angels themſelves, not that they are to be called paſſions in them, becauſe not corporeal, but they are ſo in us. Now this diſtinction is made great uſe of by <hi>Caſuiſts.</hi> There is (ſay they) a <hi>rational love,</hi> and a <hi>ſenſible love.</hi> A godly man may ſometimes feel a more <hi>ſenſible love</hi> of his children, then he doth of God, yet he is not to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or to think he doth not love God better than his children. For according to his <hi>rational love,</hi> which conſiſts in the eſteeming and prizing of Chriſt; ſo he would part with all theſe when God calleth, rather than deny his cauſe. Indeed a learned Writer rejects this diſtinction of love <hi>intenſive</hi> and <hi>appretiative, (Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceius de foedere)</hi> becauſe <hi>we are bound to love God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with all ſenſible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as well as rational eſteem;</hi> but no doubt the diſtinction well explained is of great uſe. It is made uſe of alſo in regard of <hi>ſorrow for ſin:</hi> Some tender hearts complain, they can ſhed tears, they can ſenſibly weep and mourn for the loſſe of a father or a child, but they cannot do thus about their ſins. Here again we ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them, ſaying, There is the paſſion of ſorrow which ſtirreth bodily, and the grace of ſorrow which affects the mind and the will. Thou doeſt deteſt and hate ſinne, thou judgeſt any evil to be ſuffered rather than that committed; thou haſt an unſpeakable diſplicency and diſlike of what thou haſt done, here is godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, though it be not paſſionately expreſſed in thee; therefore repentance is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe of the great change upon the mind. Thus it is alſo of great uſe in the matter of joy. There may be a <hi>rationall ſolid joy,</hi> ariſing through faith, whereby the ſoul will enjoy a peaceable tranquillity and ſerenity, when yet no bodily affectionate joy may much be perceived. The <hi>Heathen</hi> could ſay, <hi>Gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſt res ſevera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>We are to distinguiſh in this Objection concerning the matter of thy joy.</hi> Although God hath denied thee outward arguments of joy; thou haſt no health
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48709:101"/>
no friends, no outward ſupports to rejoyce in, yet thou haſt the favour of God, and his precious promiſes that are heavenly raviſhment to thee. When <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles, were in dangers often, in troubles often, yet at that time their hearts were repleniſhed with ſpiritual conſolation. Haſt thou therefore no comfort, becauſe thou wanteſt ſuch outward ones as thy heart deſireth? Let not ſoul-conſolations ſeem ſmall to thee, though with <hi>Lazarus</hi> thy condition be ſo ſtraitned, that thou canſt not get ſo much as a crum of bread. Again, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the <hi>degrees</hi> of thy <hi>comfort:</hi> There is <hi>leſſe comfort</hi> and <hi>more comfort,</hi> yet <hi>comfort;</hi> there is a greater and leſſer flame of fire, yet both fire ſtill. Thus though <hi>comfort,</hi> even the leaſt, be like fire in the boſome warming of the heart, yet it is capable of intenſion: Sometimes comfort overfloweth, and like the Sunne diſpelleth every cloud away. Sometimes, again comfort is there but in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, in an agony, conflicting with fears and ſorrows. Now wilt thou call that only comfort, which drieth up every tear, which removeth every ſigh. No, you muſt not expect perfect comfort any more than perfect faith, perfect love. The Devil and ſinne doth not only oppoſe thy graces, but thy comforts: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bleſs God, and be thankfull for a drop of comfort, though thou haſt not as much as thou deſireſt. Oh conſider, how juſtly God might make thee a <hi>Cain,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing ſhould kill and damn thee! How juſtly may he make thee a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor Miſſabib, fear round about thee,</hi> and all fear within thee? Thus God might make thee a terrour to thy ſelf, ſhould he deal with thee according to thy ſins. So that you muſt not only account great comfort, comfort, but even be thankful for more ſparing diſpenſations of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Diſtinguiſh about the time of comfort.</hi> What though ſometimes thy ſoul ſeemeth to be like a wilderneſſe full of howling beaſts; what though in ſome tribulations, thou crieſt out with <hi>David, Hath the Lord forgotten to be gracious?</hi> Yet this Sunne afterwards breaketh through the clouds, ſo that thou canſt ſay with <hi>David, Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 126. 5. They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy.</hi> You muſt know that God hath ſeaſons of joy. As there is a time to reap, and a time to ſow, ſo ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon. There is a time to laugh, and a time to mourn. Job</hi> had indeed been a long while without the comforts of God, but at laſt you read all was abundantly made up again. We muſt not therefore judge of comfort by one time, or by one tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, but compare all together: as in matter of grace, the godly are not to judge of their eſtate abſolutely by ſome particular temptation, for then they might paſſe falſe judgement upon their ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To clear this truth yet more, <hi>Conſider of Gods tender and offer of comfort.</hi> But it may be thy heart is froward and unbelieving, rejecting the <hi>conſolations</hi> of God. For although we ſay, <hi>God comforteth his in all tribulation,</hi> yet that muſt be underſtood ſo as that his people do their duty. God comforteth the godly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but it is the godly believing, the godly preparing and ſetting himſelf to receive comfort; he muſt not be as <hi>Rachel</hi> that <hi>refuſed to be comforted,</hi> as God ſpeaks once or twice to us in his Word, for ſuch or ſuch a duty; but if we refuſe to hear, if we attend not, we go on in rebellion, yet God offers ſanctifying grace to us: Thus it is alſo for comfort; God comforts again and again by his Word; by his Ordinances he often ſuggeſts, precious and ſweet arguments of joy to thy ſoul, but thou art peeviſh, dejected, and ſo they are not received: as we cannot write on wet paper, neither will the moiſtened ſtrings of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make any melodious ſound: If therefore thou haſt not comfort in thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, mayeſt not thou blame thy ſelf? If every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had not <hi>manna</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs he may condemn himſelf; God did rain enough, but his negligence ſlighted the getting of it.</p>

               <p>THe next particular to be conſidered of in his text, as it ſtands divided, is the <hi>final Cauſe</hi> of Gods comforting his people, eſpecially thoſe that are in any office in the Church; which is, <hi>That we may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that in this latter part, we are to conſider the <hi>final Cauſe it ſelf,</hi> which is, <hi>To be able to comfort others. Nihil dat quod not habet,</hi> is the old Rule. They have no skill or ability to comfort others, who have not the experience and feeling of this upon their own ſouls. It is not enough for the Miniſters of the Goſpel to have devoured many Books of learning, to be able to decide Polemical queſtions in Divinity, to convince gainſayers, to be Doctors Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, ſubtle or profound; to be <hi>Mallei Hereticorum, The hammers of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> unleſſe alſo they have the experimental works of Gods Spirit upon their own ſouls. They are not able to apply themſelves to the hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Paul</hi> had not been able to comfort others, if the Lord had not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally acquainted him with heavenly conſolations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>Subject,</hi> to whom, or the Perſons, whoſe wounds <hi>Paul</hi> (like a good <hi>Samaritan)</hi> is deſirous to pour oyl into; and that is, <hi>Them which are in any trouble.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, There is the <hi>fontal</hi> and <hi>original Cauſe</hi> of this, <hi>Whereby we our ſelves are comforted of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>final Cauſe</hi> will afford two Obſervations;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the heavenly and ſpiritual works which God vouchſafeth to his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gods ſpiritual works upon his people, are not only for their own, but for others ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note> 
                  <hi>people, are not for themſelves only, but for the advantage and edification of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who would not think that the inward comforts, and ſoul-conſolations, ſhould not be wholly incloſed within our own breaſts, that theſe ſhould not be communicated to others? Who would not ſay of theſe, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother caſe, <hi>Prov. 5. Let theſe fountains be only thine own, and not ſtrangers with thee?</hi> Yet God giveth us theſe ſoul-comforts, that we may be able to revive and comfort many ſad troubled hearts, which lie languiſhing for want of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:48709:102"/>
The ſecond Obſervation is, <hi>That thoſe have the greateſt ability and fitneſſe to help the ſouls of others, who have had the experience and work of God upon their own ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us conſider the former Doctrine, <hi>viz. That thoſe great and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual works which God vouchſafeth to his children, are not for their own god only, but for the good of others.</hi> If he ſaid in a political ſenſe, <hi>Nemo ſibi vivit ſed patriae,</hi> it is much more true of a Chriſtian, <hi>Non ſibi vivit ſed Eccleſiae. He liveth not to himſelf, but to the Church of God.</hi> Hence is that frequent compariſon in the Scripture, of the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and a <hi>body</hi> together; making all Chriſtians ſo many ſeveral Members, that if one rejoyce, all muſt rejoyce with it.</p>
               <p>To be throughly poſſeſſed of this truth, we are firſt to know, <hi>That there are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Schoolmen of ſpiritual Gifts. 1. <hi>Gratiae gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis datae.</hi>

                  <hi>two kinds of Gifts of Gods Spirit unto thoſe of the Church.</hi> The Ancient School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which diſtinction is ſtill retained with the Papiſts, is, that there are <hi>Gratiae gratis datae, Favours freely given;</hi> which are beſtowed, not ſo much for the good of them that have them, as of the good of others. Such were thoſe extraordinary gifts of Gods Spirit in the primitive times, to <hi>work Miracles,</hi> to <hi>ſpeak with tongues,</hi> &amp;c. And ſuch are alſo thoſe common gifts of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> which many may have, and yet they be never the more holy. But as water-pots, that conveighs water to the Garden, making it fruitfull, while it ſelf beareth no flowers at all; ſo are they. And truly, this is ſadly to be conſidered by all the Miniſters of the Goſpel, whether the gifts God giveth them, be not for the good of others more then their own. As the Nurſes of young Princes live upon excellent food, not for their own ſake, but to give more excellent nouriſhment to their young ones.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of gifts they call <hi>Gratiae, gratum facientes,</hi> ſuch gifts, as he <note place="margin">2. Gratti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And theſe they make <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> with the like graces. Now this diſtinction is <hi>abſurd,</hi> for the Members are confounded: The graces making acceptable, are graces freely given. It is ſolely and wholly of the grace of God, to make thee differ from others in the ſpecial work of ſanctification, as it was in the primitive times, to make one who had miraculous gifts to differ from another. And then it is <hi>falſe,</hi> for no grace we have, doth of it ſelf make us <hi>gratos</hi> accepted of to God, but it is in and through Chriſt, that their imperfections are pardoned, and ſo received.</p>
               <p>Therefore our Divines do diſtinguiſh better: That there are <hi>Dona Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrantia,</hi>

                  </note> and <hi>Dona ſanctificantia; Gifts of ſervice,</hi> and <hi>Gifts of ſanctification. Gifts of ſervice</hi> are ſuch which God giveth for the uſe of the Church, <hi>Gifts ſanctifying,</hi> are ſuch as are for the good of thoſe that have them.</p>
               <p>Now though this be true, yet in the ſecond place, you muſt not limit this ſo ſtraightly, as that <hi>ſanctifying gifts</hi> may not be <hi>ſerviceable gifts</hi> alſo. For, it's plain, that in all the people of God, their very graces as well as their gifts, are to be exerciſed for the good of others. Thy repentance, thy faith, thy joy, may be put forth to quicken and edifie others. Therefore we ſay in the Doctrine, <hi>All the ſpiritual works of God upon the ſouls of his people, are not only for themſelves, but for others.</hi> All, not only <hi>gifts,</hi> but <hi>graces:</hi> Not only their parts and their duties, but their holineſſe alſo. Hence <hi>(Prov.</hi> 15. 4.) an whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome tongue, which is the gift only that a godly man hath, is ſaid to be a <hi>tree of life,</hi> becauſe it doth ſo much ſpiritual good to others. Think then, that God hath not given thee grace and comfort for thy ſelf only, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who may ſtand in need of thee. As it was with Chriſt the Head, ſo it ſhould be with his Members proportionably. <hi>Iſa. 50. 4. To have the tongue of the learned given them from God, to be able to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary.</hi> As therefore God hath given thee fullneſſe temporally, to feed the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48709:103"/>
hungry, and to cloathe the naked, when ſuch due objects of charity are preſented to thee. Thus alſo God giveth thee faith, to help him that complaineth he cannot believe: He giveth thee comfort, to ſuccour thoſe that can find no joy. This is to be conſidered, that thou beeſt not a fountain ſealed up, but opened, whereat many may occaſionally refreſh themſelves.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The godly mans improving his gifts and graces, doth not at all hinder</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gifts are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> 
                  <hi>and diminiſh his own, but thereby increaſeth and multiplyeth them.</hi> It is like the widows giving of oyl to the Prophet, which was ſo farre from impoveriſhing, that it did enrich her. We may not then refuſe thoſe who ſhall deſire help for their ſouls; as the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> did the <hi>fooliſh,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It might be there would not be enough for themſelves.</hi> No: the more thou art willing to ſeaſon others with thy own ſalt, to quicken and comfort others, by thy own quicknings and comforts, herein thou wilt find thy ſelf more edified, and the good will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound upon thy own ſelf. For theſe improvings of thy gifts and graces ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceably to others ſouls, will multiply thy own two waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God hath promiſed, that to him which hath,</hi> that is, which uſeth and exerciſeth his talent, <hi>more ſhall be given.</hi> The more theſe breaſts give ſuck, the more will milk abound. Thou maieſt therefore look upon Gods promiſe, and expect that while thou art warming others, ſpiritual heat will be encreaſed in thy own ſelf: And</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The exerciſing of graces, doth inwardly corroberate and ſtrengthen the principle of grace.</hi> The moro thou putteſt forth thy graces to ſtirre up o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the more delight and joy wilt thou find in uſing of them. Therefore be as the Olive-tree, and the Fig-tree of thy fatneſſe and ſweetneſſe, enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cheriſhing of others who ſtand in need of thee.</p>
               <p>Theſe things promiſed, let us conſider ſome of the choice Particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">What are thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ice things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly we are to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to others. 1. Humiliation.</note> we may not only bring good to our own ſouls, but to others alſo.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſpiritual humiliation and brokenneſſe of heart which thou haſt found, may be very powerfull to perſwade others of the bitterneſſe of ſinne.</hi> Say with meltings of thy ſoul to them, Oh, if thou hadſt known, if thou hadſt ever felt what God hath made me feel, what wonderfull changes would be in thee immediately! Thoſe ſinnes which are honey, would preſently be as gall. Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. when he could recover from his broken bones, when he could enjoy the face of God, which was hid from him; <hi>Then I will teach tranſgreſſors thy waies.</hi> Then his heart could not hold any longer. He that had ſound how bitter a thing it was to provoke God by ſinne, would perſwade others alſo of it. Thus Chriſt he bids <hi>Peter, when he was converted, to confirm his Brother:</hi> To uſe his own experience to help him. So that you ſee, even the very ſorrow and grief God hath put thee into, let it be a reall Sermon to others. Our Saviour made it an aggravation of the Jews wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that <hi>if one ſhould riſe from the dead; they would not believe.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if others will not believe thee, who art (as it were) come out of hell, who haſt been in the depths of Gods diſpleaſure, their hearts muſt needs be much hardned. Oh then, make uſe of what God hath made thee feel, to be a furtherance to others! As <hi>Paul, Knowing the terrour of the Lord, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. He knew the terrour of the Lord <hi>experimentally,</hi> when he was ſtricken to the ground in a Viſion, and found the power of God ſo wonderfully upon him, in making of him another man.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The knowledge and true faith which God hath given thee, do thou make uſe of it to direct and preſerve others.</hi> This knowledge and ſound mind in <note place="margin">2. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and true ſaith.</note> Religion, is not indeed eſſentially accompanied with holineſſe: A man may be very Orthodox, be ſound in the Faith, as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> were a while, yet afterwards made ſhipwrack of all. But yet it is a ſpecial gift of Gods Spirit to be led into the truth; and although to have a ſound mind only
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48709:103"/>
be not enough to godlineſſe; yet godlineſſe cannot be without a ſound mind, in ſome meaſure or other. Every godly man is built upon the true foundation, though there may be ſome hay and ſtubble, which, though it ſhall not damn him, becauſe not fundamental hereſies, yet ſhall make his ſalvation the more difficult: <hi>He ſhall be ſaved, ſo as by fire.</hi> If then God hath preſerved thee in the truth, and that in times when many fall on thy righthand, and on thy left hand, having this ſoul plague and infection upon them, let it be thy greater care to reduce ſuch: Let them have thy light, thy helps, and knowledge: Put thy light upon the candleſtick, and not under a buſhel. Conſider that place, <hi>James 5. 19, 20. If any do erre from the truth, and one convert him, let him know he ſhall ſave a ſoul from death.</hi> So that you ſee the ſalvation or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another, is intereſted in thy improving of ſounds knowledge to inform ſuch. Howſoever the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. in a particular caſe about things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, adviſeth, ſaying, <hi>Haſt thou faith? have it to thy ſelf:</hi> Yet take heed of doing ſo in fundamental and eſſential truths of God: Do not there <hi>have faith to thy ſelf,</hi> but endeavour that all may be ſeaſoned with the ſame ſound knowledge. Even a private Chriſtian, though he is not to uſurpe the Office of a Teacher, yet he hath his proper ſphere, wherein he may move to propagate the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt. This knowledge then is a talent, and expect that God will have an account of the improving of it. Say, as of comfort in the text, ſo of ſound knowledge and truth, <hi>The Spirit of God hath directed us into the truth, that we may alſo be able to guide others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe temptations and aſſaults which the children of God have, are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                  <hi>not only for themſelves, but for others alſo:</hi> That they may be able to direct and guide others, groaning under the like temptations. It is true, God worketh a great good for his own people by theſe fiery darts of Satan. 2 <hi>Cor. 12. Paul</hi> had thoſe buffettings of Satan, <hi>that he might not be puffed up with thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full revelations he enjoyed.</hi> There is no ſuch way to keep the gracious ſoul humble and lowly in its own ſelf, as theſe affrights from the devil: Even as vizors and ſuch horrid repreſentations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> are children, and make them runne home to their Parents; ſo alſo do theſe buffettings of Satan and tumults raiſed by him, drive us out of our ſelves; make us highly to prize Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe: Yea, though theſe temptations be very irkſome and into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rable in themſelves, yet commonly none are ſuch choice, ſpiritual, and eminent Chriſtians as thoſe who have been in theſe combates. As dung, though noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in it ſelf, yet it maketh the field fruitfull, and full of beauty; thus do theſe temptations of Satan to a godly heart. But yet this is not all; By theſe the Lord intends them to be admirably uſefull to others. Alas, how many poor afflicted ſouls, eſpecially new beginners, new Converts, have their trembling hearts ſuggeſt to them, Who was ever tempted as thou art? Can any be the Son of God, and have ſuch horrid and vile injections in his ſoul as thou haſt? What is this but the beginning of hell in thee? Is not damnation already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun upon thee? Now for a troubled ſoul in theſe whirlepooles, to meet with ſuch who are able to ſay, They have been thus, and thus; theſe are no new temptations, but what hath uſually befallen the godly: Is not ſuch an one called out by God, to pour oyl into ſuch wounds? Doth not God plainly ſpeak, <hi>Therefore haſt thou been buffetted, tempted, and exerciſed, that ſuch bruiſed and wounded ſouls may receive comfort from thee?</hi> Hence it is that Chriſt himſelf would be tempted, <hi>that he might be able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2. 18. Thus by our temptations we are not only to learn many things, but alſo to teach others. (But of this more in the ſecond Doctrine.)</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Here are <hi>Conſolations:</hi> And although theſe are of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">4. Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> in the particular to every Believer, becauſe <hi>the joy of the Lord is his ſtrength,</hi> hereby alſo he walketh thankfully and fruitfully; yet let him take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48709:104"/>
narrow and ſparing in uſing them for others comforts. For if thou art a Miniſter of the Goſpel, then thy work is not only to convert, but to comfort; not only to bring out of ſinnes, but out of fears and dejections. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle at the laſt verſe in this Chapter, <hi>We are helpers of your joy.</hi> Conſider that not only what is acquired by ſtudy, but what alſo is inſpired by God into thy ſoul, may be of admirable efficacy to others. Though Chriſts Sermons and Parables were like a two-edged ſword, mightily dividing between true grace and hypocriſie, yet <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 50. 4.) he expreſſeth his Miniſtry by this, to <hi>ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to the weary:</hi> and this he calleth <hi>the tongue of the learned.</hi> We call it Learning, to alledge the Ancients, to be full of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> to empty out the bowels of School-learning: yea, ſome are ſo ſimple, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſtudied words, and compoſed language, rare Learning; whereas ſpeech is like the Arrow, that is not commended for ſtuds of gold, or Jewels on it, but if it hit the mark. Thus that is Oratory which is moſt proper to effect the end of our ſpeech: To make the ſinners weep, the hard heart to tremble, and the ſad to be comforted. You ſee it's <hi>the tongue of the learned</hi> to do this. Doth then God give thee comfort? be not thou wanting then to ſupport and comfort the feeble-minded. It may be thou art a kind of a <hi>ſpiritual Dives,</hi> full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, and thinkeſt thou haſt ſtore enough laid up for thee, both to live and die with, take heed leſt ſome poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> would be glad of thy crums, and thou doſt not give to him.</p>

                  <hi>That thoſe only are able to make fit applications to the ſouls of others, who have</hi>

                  <hi>had the experimental working of Gods grace upon their own ſouls.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>That we might be able,</hi> implying, otherwiſe there would not be that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and fitneſſe in us which ought to be.</p>
               <p>To diſcover this, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That <hi>there is a two-fold knowledge of divine and ſpiritual things:</hi> The one is <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> and meerly <hi>Theoretical,</hi> when we know them, yea and it may be give a ſound and firm aſſent to them: And ſuch are all thoſe learned men who are very Orthodox, and wonderfully able to maintain the truths of Chriſt againſt all oppoſers whatſoever. Such as theſe are, God raiſeth up many
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48709:104"/>
times as eminent Pillars in the Church. But becauſe this is not enough to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; therefore in the ſecond place, there is a <hi>ſaving, affectionate, practical</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Practical and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</note> 
                  <hi>and experimental knowing of truth,</hi> whereby we do not only believe ſuch things, but by believing we do love and embrace the truths we know: We do <hi>credendo amare,</hi> we have a <hi>faith which worketh by love.</hi> Now it muſt be confeſſed, that the condition of thoſe who are only Orthodox, and no more, is much to be pittied and lamented: To write againſt <hi>Arminians</hi> and others, about the work of Gods grace in Converſion, and yet never <hi>experimentally</hi> to have this upon their own ſouls: So to treat of Juſtification, and Chriſt, yet not at all to have the ſaving and ſweet operations of theſe things upon their ſouls, is greatly to be bewailed: To be like the builders of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, that proved a place of reſt and refuge in the time of the deluge for others, when they themſelves had no advantage by it. But it is no wonder that ſuch excellent knowledge, and of ſuch admirable lovely uſe in the Church, be not ſaving, while it goeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe practice and doing is the end of all <hi>Theological</hi> knowledge. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them,</hi> Joh. 13. 17. So that this <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and <hi>practical knowledge</hi> of divine things, is that which compleateth the former. To know Chriſt, ſo as to have him; to know regeneration, ſo as to be born again; this is the glory of all knowledge. Hence is that Commandement, (2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5.) To examine our ſelves, to try our ſelves, whether we be in the faith, and in Chriſt or no.</hi> The latter word ſignifieth, <hi>to make an experience, or an experimental tryal</hi> of grace in us. So that if you had a man who could ſpeak like an Oracle in all the points of Divinity, who was a very Miracle in reſpect of learning, yet he is but a <hi>tinckling cymbal,</hi> and ſpeaks in the matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion like a Parrot, not rightly or fully apprehending of them, till he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly taſted of the ſweetneſſe of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This ſaving experimental knowledge doth differ in its whole kind,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">This ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the whole kind.</note> 
                  <hi>and is of another nature in a moral conſideration, from a meer Orthodox, or bare ſpeculative knowledge.</hi> I ſhall not enter into a large diſpute concerning the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between illumination in a temporary believer, (although now we are not ſo much ſpeaking of the <hi>habitus fidei,</hi> as <hi>Theologiae,</hi> which may be in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knowing men) and that which is in a true convert: We ſhall ſuppoſe it for a truth from <hi>Heb. 6. That thoſe who were inlightned,</hi> yea and had ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental workings, (of which a non) yet they had not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they had not the things <hi>that hold faſt ſalvation;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>hoped for better things.</hi> They therefore ſo differ, that take a man who doth only know divine things by Books, by Sermons, by reading of Authours, and was not at all acquainted wih the Spirits effectual teaching by the Word; and let him at laſt come to have theſe things ſet home upon him by an effectual demonſtration of Gods Spirit; let him know theſe things <hi>as the truth is in Jeſus,</hi> which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> mentioneth <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and he will then cry out, acknowledging that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew any thing till then: That he was in the dark; that he had but a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed kind of folly; that he ſpoke of theſe things, as men do of Countries which they ſee in Maps, only by a general knowledge, having never travelled to ſee the Countries themſelves. There is ſuch a fuller power accompanying this <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical</hi> knowledge, that the former was but a ſhadow to this ſubſtance. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve many men, Do they not read the Scripture? Do not they go from Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Chapter? But till it be the ingrafted Word in them, they have the images and pictures of things, not the things themſelves. <note place="margin">All knowledge that is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſome kind of affections, is not an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>That is not to be called experimental knowledge, which may be accompanied with ſome kind of ſenſible affections. Mat.</hi> 13. the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary believer <hi>received the word with joy.</hi> You ſee then, that ſome may have joy, and that from the Word, yet this not be the true ſaving knowledge or faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. ſome are there alſo ſaid, not only to be inlightened, but to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48709:105"/>
have <hi>taſted the good word of God.</hi> Here you may obſerve, that ſome may taſt, may have joy; all which do inferre ſome affectionate inward experimental workings on the ſoul, and yet not attain to have the true and honeſt heart: And the reaſon is, becauſe theſe affectionate workings, they are but tranſitory, they quickly vaniſh away: There is no ſetled conſtancy or permanency in them. So that we are not to give credit to all the affections, nor to all inlargements that we may find in our ſelves, even about holy things, but we are to be ſure that there be deep rooting enough. Hence</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>All experimental workings of the ſoul, are to be judged and tryed by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">All experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the ſoul, are to be tryed by the Scriptures.</note> 
                  <hi>the Scripture.</hi> Our hearts being full of guile and impoſture, the devil alſo <hi>transforming himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> hence it may come about that we may have the experience of much joy, of many inlargements, and yet all the while be in the devils waies. Hence it is that all Sectaries almoſt, will tell us of the great ſupport and comfort they have had, and that ever ſince they embraced thoſe new waies; yea, ſome make themſelves to be the only ſpiritual men, that all other are in the fleſh: as <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote a Book againſt the Orthodox, ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it <hi>Contra Pſachicos,</hi> as thoſe that were meerly natural, in the mean time he pretended to private revelations. The experiences therefore which we find in our ſouls, we muſt examine and try, leſt we make that to be of God, which is indeed of the devil. No doubt many deluded ſouls, in dangerous and damnable waies, comfort others of the ſame way with them, by that comfort wherewith they are comforted, not of God, but of the devil. Therefore let our experiences, eſpecially of comfort, be judged by the Word, in theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. <note place="margin">How our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences are to be judged by the Word. 1. Are they from Scripture rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood?</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, In the manner and way how thou comeſt by them, <hi>Are they by the Scriptures truly underſtood?</hi> (I ſay, truly underſtood:) For, if thou abuſeſt Scripture, putting thy own ſenſe upon it, and thereby receiving comfort, it is no longer then <hi>Verbum Dei,</hi> but <hi>verbum tuum;</hi> thou wreſteſt it, and makeſt it thy own, or the devils, and not Gods. If therefore thy experience of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort be grounded on the Word, if thy conſolation flow from hence, then this will abide, <hi>That we through comfort of the Scriptures might have hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 4. The Spirit of God doth firſt lead into all truth, and then into all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In the original, and the efficient cauſe; is it from God, from the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Are they from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God?</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit of God?</hi> Or from the devil, who may harden thy heart, and make thee have ſuch joy as mad men have, not feeling their own miſery? The comfort and the joy that is truly ſo, is ſtill attributed to God and the Holy Ghoſt, as the fountains thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Doth thy experience of Conſolation make thee more humble and empty?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Do they make thee more holy and humble?</note> Doth it drive thee out of all thy vain carnal confidences? This argueth it cometh from God, if with the <hi>Centurian,</hi> when Chriſt cometh to thy ſoul, thou ſayeſt, Lord, I am unworthy this joy, this conſolation ſhould enter into me. And therefore the more comfort, the more lowly and debaſed in thy own eyes: And never more, then when the moſt joy. This is a good experience of comfort, as coming from God. So alſo, if this comfort be <hi>conducing to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> if by this thou art more quickned to mortifie ſinne, to ſubdue the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that remain; if this be like oyl to the wheeles, thou art more fervent, more <note place="margin">Reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Doctrine. 1. They that have not this experimental knowledge, they have no skill to cure others.</note> zealous in all holy duties, then make much of this comfort, for it cometh from Heaven. If then we have the experience of Gods working upon our ſouls, both in the way of grace, and the way of comfort, then, and never till then, are we fitted to deal with the ſouls of others. And there are theſe Reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>None can wiſely be a Phyſician to heal a diſeaſe in another, unleſſe he have skill and underſtanding in the nature of it, and the fit remedy for it.</hi> Now while a man hath no experimental knowledge of Gods workings upon his own
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48709:105"/>
ſoul, he hath no skill, no heavenly heart about the diſeaſes in others ſouls. Bring a poor wounded ſoul that is burdned with ſinne, that would be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Evangelical</hi> comforts, to a <hi>Phariſaical,</hi> ſelf-righteous Doctor, and alas, he will, as <hi>Ely</hi> thought the poor weeping woman, bitter in ſoul, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, to be drunk; ſo will theſe think ſuch an one mad and fooliſh. Hence (you heard) Chriſt would be tempted as we are, <hi>that he might ſuccour thoſe that are tempted; that he might have the tongue of the learned, to ſpeak to ſuch who are weary.</hi> Thoſe that have not been thus humbled, thus exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, thus comforted, they are no waies able to be any helpfull comforters, but like the Prieſt and the Levite, will paſſe by thoſe who are thus wounded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As ſuch can have no skill or underſtanding, ſo <hi>they cannot have any ſutableneſſe of pity and compaſſion to thoſe that are ſo afflicted in ſpirit,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. They can have any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of of pity and compaſſion.</note> 
                  <hi>and needed comfort.</hi> She ſaid, <hi>Non ignara mali miſeris,</hi> &amp;c. The experience ſhe had of miſeries, made her pity thoſe that were in the like. God would have the <hi>Jews</hi> be kind to ſtrangers, <hi>becauſe they had once been ſtrangers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Thou that haſt been in the deep waters of Gods wrath, thou that knoweſt how inſupportable it is, to feel the frowns and wrath of God for ſin, with what melting bowels, with what pittifull affections wilt thou be, like the <hi>good Samaritan?</hi> Hence it is, that as the Lord Chriſt himſelf did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with the wrath of God, being in unſpeakable agonies, ſo alſo many of the choiceſt ſervants of God, eſpecially Miniſters, have been under the harrow and hammer of theſe deſertions, that they may be more poliſhed for Gods building. <hi>Luther</hi> doth manifeſt in ſeveral places, what the great works of God were that he felt on himſelf, ſo that though of a ſtout and undaunted ſpirit, yet the anger of God did beat him to powder; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no help for his afflicted ſoul in any Popiſh Principles, no more then the Dove could place of abode, while the waters did overflow, at laſt, when it pleaſed God to comfort him by <hi>Evangelical</hi> comforts, through a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Chriſt and righteouſneſſe, what a tree of life did his tongue become to others? How many did he comfort, by thoſe comforts God had comforted him? <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo, it's noted of him, that he was a man of deep and retired thoughts within, yet did retain them much in his own breſt; and no doubt, by this he was the more prepared to be an excellent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church of God. We ſee then, he only, that hath the <hi>experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> either of the bitterneſſe of ſinne, or the ſweetneſſe of the Goſpel, is only able, with a tender heart and hand, to cure a wounded ſoul. And certainly, if the Apoſtle make this an Argument, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. to rejoynt (as it were) one that is overtaken in a fault, becauſe the moſt ſpiritual may be tempted, how much rather when thou haſt been tempted? So that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental way in holy things, worketh much commiſeration, and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing with thoſe who groan under the hand of God upon them. When <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was in that perplexed agony, crying out, <hi>I have ſinned, in betraying the innocent blood;</hi> with what ſtony and ſeared hearts did the Phariſees reject him, ſaying, <hi>What is that to us, look thou to that?</hi> It's a mercy for broken-hearted ſinners, to fall into the hands of a tender experienced Believer, who hath felt what they feel, and ſo is able to conceive of their ſad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And indeed, even as for inſtruction of the ignorant, there needeth much patience, ſo there doth alſo pitty, which will put thee upon unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diligence to comfort the dejected. For, it is not a work ſoon done, they muſt bear with many infirmities; they are full of ſubtile objections; and when they are for a while comforted, they looſe all preſently again: inſomuch that he muſt have tender bowels, who is not wearied out with their weakneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:48709:106"/>
Thirdly, Such experienced ones are only able to deal with tempted ſouls, <note place="margin">3. Becauſe ſuch only are found reall and in earneſt.</note> to inſtruct and comfort them, <hi>becauſe the afflicted find ſuch only reall.</hi> Such are in earneſt: He that hath experimentally felt the bitterneſſe of ſinne, maketh it manifeſt to others, that it's not meer Oratory or Eloquence, that ſets him againſt ſinne, but ſomething within, that he feeleth burning like fire within. The very Heathen could ſay, <hi>Si vis me flere dolendum est primo tibi,</hi> A man that hath not inwardly felt the power of truth upon his heart, he is ſo cold, ſo formall, ſo lazy, that you cannot tell whether he believeth the things he preacheth to be true, or no. And ſo alſo for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, muſt it not much ſatisfie the dejected ſoul to meet with one under the ſame temptations, under the ſame fears, and yet now prayeth with joy, heareth with joy? Thou canſt find all thy heart (as it were) in him, and yet he is delivered, he is comforted, who thought it as impoſſible as I do: Whereas if a man be a ſtranger to theſe workings of God, the tempted ſoul flyeth off, ſaying, He knoweth not how to judge of theſe things; I can give no credit to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Such are only able, <hi>becauſe they alone are faithfull.</hi> They dare not flatter them; they dare not ſooth them: They will give them no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <note place="margin">4. Becauſe ſuch alone are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> if there be no cauſe for it. Now the truly broken ſoul, loveth this faithfull dealing better then flattery. There is a woe to thoſe <hi>that made the heart of thoſe merry, whom God would have made ſad.</hi> And there are many in the miniſterial Office, that are unworthy, and flattering in this caſe, comforting every one that lyeth a dying, though never ſo prophane. Now he that is truly humbled, careth not for ſuch a mans comfort, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he will not deal faithfully; he will ſend me to hell with comfort. And whereas it is one rule, that experienced Divines give to tempted ſouls, That <hi>under their fears and doubts, they muſt believe the judgment of the Ministers of God about their condition, rather then themſelves;</hi> this muſt be underſtood of <hi>ſound, faithfull,</hi> and <hi>experienced Miniſters;</hi> otherwiſe, it is a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to fall into the hands of fawning, flattering Miniſters, who will encourage them, and ſend them to Heaven, when they themſelves know not either what true ſorrow for ſinne, or true Evangelical comfort meaneth.</p>

                  <hi>trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are not only to ſeek the converſion of ſuch who go aſtray, but alſo to regard the conſolation of thoſe that lack it. Hence <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, <hi>That ſhe had none to comfort her.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of this duty often, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 4. 18. Comfort one another with theſe things.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 11, 14. <hi>Comfort the feeble minded.</hi> You ſee by this preſſing this duty ſo often, that we are ſeriouſly and diligently to practiſe it, leſt as God will judge for neglect of corporal alms to fit objects of charity, ſo alſo he will call to account for the not diſpencing of theſe ſpiritual alms. Thou haſt not viſited thoſe, who were ſpiritually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the guilt of their ſins; neither fed thoſe with the bread from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven who were hungry. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſpeaking concerning the inceſtuous perſon, who was now deeply humbled for his ſinne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. exhorts them to <hi>comfort him, leſt he be ſwallowed up with too much ſorrow.</hi> We have a notable inſtance for this in <hi>Jobs</hi> friends, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 11. who when they heard of all the evil that was come upon him, they made an appointment toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him. Thus you ſee that it is a ſpecial duty, we are carefully to diſcharge, to refreſh the ſouls of others who are caſt down; That as the cuſtom was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> he giveth a precept about it, <hi>Prov. 31. 6, 7. Give wine unto thoſe that are of an heavy heart, that he may drink, and remember his miſery no more.</hi> So we are in a ſpiritual conſideration to give the wine of the Goſpel to ſuch as mourn for <note place="margin">Propoſitions clearing the truth. 1. There are two ſorts of troubles. 1. Spiritual and inward.</note> their ſins.</p>
               <p>To diſcover this truth, Conſider</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The troubled</hi> (as you heard formerly) <hi>are of two ſorts; Thoſe who are afflicted in ſoul,</hi> as the <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> whom ſorrow had almoſt ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up as a whirlpool. Theſe that call for a drop of water (as it were) to cool their ſcorching ſouls, and cannot have it. To ſuch as theſe we are to apply
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48709:107"/>
our ſelves with all tenderneſſe to comfort them, as the Apoſtle exhorted the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi> For ſeeing that a wounded ſpirit is more hardly born, than any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miſery whatſoever; no wonder that in this caſe if ever, we come with all comforting medicines to heal them and revive them. We read the Lord Chriſt, when he was in thoſe agonies, conflicting with the ſenſe of Gods wrath, that even he himſelf had an <hi>Angel</hi> to comfort him. Muſt <hi>Chriſt the Sonne of God</hi> have an <hi>Angel</hi> ſent to comfort him? How much more then a poor wretched ſinner, ready to fall into hell with the burden of his ſins? This is fully repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Elihu;</hi> Job 33. 28. where ſpeaking of a man chaſtened by the Lord, and conſuming away, ſo that he doth even abhor to eat his bread, <hi>If there come an Interpreter, a Meſſenger, one amongst a thouſand, that can ſhew to ſuch his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe,</hi> that make it evident to him that he is no hypocrite, but the truth of grace abideth in him, <hi>then his fleſh ſhall be freſh as a childs, he ſhall pray to God, and he will be favourable, and he ſhall ſee his face with joy.</hi> See what a wonderfull change ſuch a meſſenger may make, he doth even raiſe him from the dead, he that was pininig away is returned to his youth, and this is for ſpiritual troubles.</p>
               <p>Again, in the ſecond place, <hi>There are outward troubles;</hi> and it's our duty to <note place="margin">2. Outward.</note> comfort ſuch alſo, and endeavour to turn their water into wine; and of ſuch troubles happily the Apoſtle ſpeaketh chiefly in this Text. For although God be ready to fill their hearts with joy, yet he will have this done many times by the help of others, becauſe we being members in the ſame body, are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſerviceable to one another.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>Every one in trouble doth greatly need the aſſistance and help of others to comfort them.</hi> Take the moſt godly Miniſter, or the moſt <note place="margin">2. The afflicted need the help of others to comfort them, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be never ſo skilfull in the comſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others.</note> able Chriſtian, who have been moſt eminent and ſucceſſefull to comfort others, yet when they have been tempted and caſt down themſelves, they have not bin able to make uſe of thoſe directions they have given to others. As <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> though never ſo able to help others, yet in their own diſeaſes, they need the advice of others: Inſomuch that there is no Chriſtian in any trouble can ſay, I need not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of any, the help of any, I can ſupport and comfort my ſelf well enough. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1. 12. though ſo eminent an Apoſtle caught up into the third Heaven, yet he did long to ſee the <hi>Romans, That he might be comforted with them,</hi> though that might be in reſpect of their graces, to ſee this flouriſh, as in other places, <hi>Ye are my Crown and my Joy, if you ſtand fast in the Lord.</hi> But howſoever we ſee <hi>job,</hi> though ſo eminent, yet not able to pour oyl into his own wounds, he is without comfort, and cannot help himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now there are theſe Reaſons, <hi>Why thoſe who are afflicted, though never ſo able and gracious, yea excellently skilfull to comfort others, yet they themſelves need help from others in their temptations:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe their temptations do darken and obnubilate their own judgements,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. Becauſe remptations darken the judgement.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſo they are not able to ſee that ground, and thoſe arguments of comfort, which others may.</hi> It is with them, as thoſe who would behold their face in a broken glaſs, or in muddied ſtreams; like thoſe that look through a green glaſs, they judge every thing green; while judgement is kept clear, though faith be weak, yet ſtill there is ſome ſupport; but then is the ſoul wholly caſt down, when the eye is become darkneſs, when in ſtead of a Father it apprehends God a Judge; when inſtead of beholding the gracious works of Gods Spirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they think they ſee nothing but hypocriſie and rottenneſs in themſelves. Oh now how welcome is ſuch an one of a thouſand, who ſhew to that man his uprightneſs! <note place="margin">2. Becauſe the ſenſe of their grief doth wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe them.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The moſt eminent in their troubles need comfort from others, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſenſe and feeling of their grief doth wholly poſſeſſe them, ſo that they mind nothing elſe.</hi> Whatſoever it be that is a burden upon them, with this they riſe,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48709:107"/>
and go to bed, and groan under it; now another Chriſtian is very fit to put them in mind of ſuch promiſes, to remember them of ſuch paſſages in Scripture, which their immoderate ſorrow had wholly driven out of their mind. The ſoul of a man cannot be intent to many things at once; therefore the ſenſe and feeling of its particular exerciſe taketh up the whole heart, as if there were no Scripture, no promiſe, no balm in <hi>Gilead;</hi> for any then to be a Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, a Monitor; you forget ſuch a place, you remember not what the Scripture delivereth concerning your condition, or you do not think of what you have formerly. Say with <hi>David, I will remember the works of the Lord of old.</hi> Thus (I ſay) even the moſt eminent are ſo apt to be ſenſible of what is upon them, that they remember not ſuch things as may do them good.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Even the moſt eminent, <hi>who are in any trouble, they cannot ſo bear</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Becauſe the moſt eminent, when in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to much unbelief and frowardneſs.</note> 
                  <hi>it, but they are ſubject to unbelief, to diſcontent, to frowardneſſe, to many ſad exerciſes of ſoul.</hi> And therefore no wonder, if they need the help of others to allay that evil ſpirit in them, as <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died:</hi> So mayeſt thou ſay, Oh if ſuch a Chriſtian, ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter had been with me, I had not been ſo impatient, I had not been ſo deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! We cannot be in exerciſes, eſpecially in ſpiritual deſertions, and the ſenſe of Gods wrath; but withall there will ariſe much ſinne, there will be froth and mud that our hearts will ſend forth. In this boiling of the ſoul there will ariſe ſome ſcumme. It is true in Chriſt, although he was under thoſe diſconſolate deſertions deſtitute of comfort, yet all the while there was no ſinne in him, no grace was weakned, though his comfort was abated, his ſoul was like a glaſs with pure water in it, all the moving and toſſing of it up and down, could not cauſe any filth or mud in it; but it is otherwiſe with us, our ſouls have mud, a ſinfull ſediment in the bottome, and no ſooner are we toſſed and moved up and down, but this cometh to the top, our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſheweth it ſelf preſently; and therefore we need the prayers, the advice of others, yea rebuke ſometimes, becauſe like <hi>Rachel, We refuſe to be comforted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Every one needeth comfort from others in trouble, <hi>Becauſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Becauſe the Devil is then moſt buſie.</note> 
                  <hi>the Devil is then moſt forward and buſie;</hi> He is ready to accuſe God to thee, and to accuſe thee to God; He moveth in <hi>job</hi>'s wife, that <hi>he ſhould curſe God and die.</hi> He is the <hi>Prince of darkneſſ;</hi> and <hi>a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> and thoſe that are afflicted they are almoſt in his jaws: The room is almoſt ready ſwept and garniſhed for him: How many in their troubles hath he prevailed upon to deſpair, to ſelf-murder, to deſtroy themſelves? Thus he is watching at his advantage, to provoke thee in thy troubles, to impatience, to diſcontent, and from theſe to rage and fretting againſt God, and from theſe to final deſpair: Shall then the Devil be thus buſie to aſſault a poor ſoul? and wilt thou not be as diligent to recover him?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Though God be the God of all comfort, and ſo he can if he pleaſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Laſtly, God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters and Chriſtians as a means to comfort others.</note> 
                  <hi>comfort without any</hi> Paul'<hi>s, any Ministers, or Chriſtians, yet he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their ſervice as a means by which he will comfort us.</hi> It might be thought a vain thing, to ſend for Miniſter or Chriſtians to comfort, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is God onely that can do this; but you muſt know, God will do it by his inſtituted means. Whereas therefore it is the Devils great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to keep off ſuch afflicted ones from coming to the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from Prayer, from revealing and manifeſting their temptations, to thoſe that are holy and wiſe: Let ſuch troubled ſouls know, that this is the way to throw themſelves irrecoverably into the Devils mouth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though God will comfort; yet it muſt be in the uſe of the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Miniſtry, by Prayer, by Conference: Therefore though thou
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48709:108"/>
complaineſt, thou dareſt not pray, thou dareſt not come to the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for then thy temptations are moſt violent and fiery, yet give not them over, for in and through theſe God will at laſt communicate comfort to thee; <hi>God is the God of comfort through the instituted and appointed means of comfort.</hi> Indeed if by an abſolute neceſſity thou art deprived of all means of comfort from others, as many of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> have been, then thou mayeſt expect immediate conſolations from God, and that he will be in ſtead of all Miniſters, and godly friends to thee. And ſo much for the ſecond general head.</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>The dispenſation of comfort to thoſe that are in trouble,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. The diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè</hi> or <hi>Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtativè.</hi>
                  </note> is of two ſorts, <hi>Charitativè</hi> and <hi>Poteſtativè. Charitativè</hi> is that which every Chriſtian in the way of love is bound to do to another. When the Apoſtle commanded the <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nians, to comfort one another,</hi> he ſpeaketh to them as private Chriſtians. <hi>Potestativè</hi> is that whereby the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are in Power and Office, do adminiſter conſolation to others. And as the Miniſter in Office hath a peculiar promiſe from God in the diſcharge of his Office; ſo may the private Chriſtian expect a greater ſucceſs in his labours, when faithfully diſcharged: For the Office is not enough, unleſs it be diſpenſed in Gods way. Hence to them is given the Keyes or Power to bind and looſe, with this addition, that what they do ſhall be ratified, that is, as they ſay, <hi>Clave non errante,</hi> provided that they bind or looſe in a Scripture-way. The Miniſter then of the Goſpel is by his Office to comfort as well as to terrifie, to looſe as well as to bind; not that he doth theſe things authoritatively, but miniſterially and declarative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only, yet ſo that in the declaration of this, a ſpecia: ſucceſs may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from God. Hence <hi>James 5. 14, 15. Thoſe who are ſick,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to call for the Elders to pray for them;</hi> and in that is included all other duties requiſite to the ſaving of that ſick mans ſoul. Yea ſome have been ſo greatly diſconſolate, and tempted by Satan, that learned and pious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines have though is convenient, to give a particular abſolution, and private ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Goſpel to ſuch an humbled ſinner, and that in a miniſterial way, as in the name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, We ſay in the Doctrine, <hi>That it's a duty in a right manner to</hi>

                  <hi>administer comfort to ſuch as are in trouble. Now that right manner compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends very much,</hi> for an unſeaſonable and unwiſe, or unfaithfull comfort, doth deſtroy rather than do good; even as Phyſick unſeaſon by given. To a right manner, there is required:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A skill and knowledge of the temptation, as alſo the dispoſition of him who is thus exerciſed.</hi> To be a Phyſician of ſouls requireth admirable pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and wiſdome above what is in the maſter of the body. Every tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation is not cured by every comfort, neither is every exerciſed man the ſame he appeareth to be; he may be an hypocrite, he may live in known ſinnes to himſelf, yet ſecret to others; and if comfort be given to every one that complaineth, this will be to give pearl to ſwine. <hi>Job</hi>'s friends, though wiſe and godly, did miſtake in the nature of <hi>Job</hi>'s affliction, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was for ſome extraordinary ſinne, or his hypocriſie in the wayes of God, whereas it was for the trial of his graces: They alſo miſtook about his perſon, condemning him for an hypocrite, when yet he was full of integrity. Thus you ſee we may miſtake on the right hand, and on the left.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The right way of comforting lieth in taking the Scripture-way, and that</hi>

The <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> do ſadly complain of thoſe Prieſts <hi>that daubed with untempered morter,

that cryed Peace when there was none;</hi> and no doubt many Miniſters ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for their applying of falſe comforts, as well as teaching falſe Doctrines. Every ſick man looketh that the Miniſter ſhould only comfort him; if he ſpeak of ſinnes and damnations, he is counted cruel, and one that will drive men to deſpair. But content your ſelves, we muſt not, we dare not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but in the Scripture-way; and that is to ſuch only as do mourn for their ſinnes; and that upon true grounds. For every <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> can humble themſelves, while the hand of God is upon them, and they think they ſhall die; but theſe are not the mourners that God would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; thou muſt bewail thy ſinnes from ſpiritual principles and heavenly motives, ſuch as will hold in thy health, as well as in thy ſickneſs. This then is the ſoul of this Doctrine, <hi>It's a duty to comfort thoſe who are in a trouble, but in a wiſe, faithfull Scripture-way.</hi> Otherwiſe thoſe damned ſouls thrown into hell, will to all eternity curſe thoſe Miniſters that cryed <hi>Peace, peace</hi> to them: Oh that ye had cryed <hi>hell, hell, damnation, damnation</hi> to us; that might have done us more good!</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:48709:109"/>
This truth hath its great practical uſe. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us conſider, <hi>That there are general grounds of comfort for all the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. There are both general and particular grounds of comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>godly in all their tribulations, and there are ſpecial particular ones. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral grounds of comfort</hi> are ſuch, that all the godly may make uſe of at all times, be they <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile, bond or free,</hi> eye or foot in the body of Chriſt, there is no difference, no exemption, this fountain is ſet open. Neither is it like the <hi>pool of Betheſda,</hi> wherein the firſt only that ſtept in could be healed, for here all are invited to drink, firſt and laſt, and that abundantly. There are <hi>Catholicon</hi> comforts, that let our diſeaſes be what they will be, theſe are proper to cure us. There are ſome promiſes ſo full of general comfort for every condition, that they are made for the <hi>meridian</hi> of every godly man.</p>
               <p>Let us give you ſome ſummary draught of them: As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That all afflictions do come from the love of a Father to ſuch as believe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What are the general grounds of comfort. 1. All afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come from a Father.</note> So that although they be grievous to fleſh and bloud, and have a bitter taſte, yet they come from a ſweet root. Theſe thorns do grow upon a vine. Theſe bitter ſtreams come from a ſweet fountain. Now this ground of comfort belongs to all that have an unfeigned love to God. Canſt thou make out thy evidence of being in Chriſt? Is thy name to be found in the book of life? Then this comfort thou mayeſt apply to thy ſelf; be thy condition or quality what it can be, thou mayeſt boldly take this cordial, and it is as proper for thee, as a <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> any of thoſe who are pillars in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Heb. 12. 6. For whom he loveth, he chaſteneth.</hi> So that you ſee here is ſuch an argument of comfort, that every member of the body of Chriſt may uſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another general ground of comfort, is, <hi>The end and fruit of afflictions.</hi> As they come from Gods love, ſo they are to ſubdue ſinne, to bring us near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">2. The end is good.</note> to God. Hence afflictions are compared to the fire that purgeth away the droſs, to winnowing that driveth away the chaff; to pruning that cuts off the luxuriant branches, and makes the other branches more fruitfull. They are given by Chriſt the wiſe Phyſician of our ſouls as heavenly phyſick, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable remedies to crucifie to ſinne, and to quicken to righteouſneſſe. If God denieth thee ſuch outward comforts thou deſireſt, know that this very denial is for thy good; and dareſt thou ſay, Lord, let me have them, though they damn me; Let me not be afflicted, though it will do me good, <hi>Quid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All things ſhall work together for the good of thoſe who love God.</hi> The Apoſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpeaketh notably of theſe afflictions in reſpect of the iſſue of them, as well as of the original whence they flow, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9, 10, 11. where a three-fold advantage is ſaid to come by them:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By yeelding to the Father of Spirits chastiſing us, we live.</hi> Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therefore are the way to make us live ſpiritually here, and eternally here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. If it were not for afflictions thou mightſt die and be damned; They have prevented much ſinne; They have been like a file to the iron to get off the ruſt; They have been like the plowing and harrowing of the ground to fit thee to bring forth fruit. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is ſaid <hi>to chastiſe us for our profit,</hi> which is expreſſed to be, <hi>That we might be partakers of holineſſe.</hi> Tribulations then are very profitable and advantagious things, though fleſh and blood can hardly ſay ſo. It may be thy afflictions have done thee more good, than all the mercies thou ever hadſt. And therefore under every exerciſe, examine, What profit have I got? Wherein am I made more holy? And then</p>
               <p n="3">3. At the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe,</hi> after the grievous and burdenſome way of them for the preſent, <hi>afterwards they will yeeld a peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe.</hi> The chaſtening doth but ſeem grievous, and that for the preſent, but afterwards
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48709:109"/>
it makes more holy, which is ſaid to be the <hi>peaceable fruit of it.</hi> The ſoul that raged and fretted, finding the benefit, begins then in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quiet manner to bleſſe and praiſe God for it. This is a <hi>General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> Every godly man may ſay, this belongs to me in my afflictions, as well as to any other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not to be too large here, <hi>The benefits and heavenly advantages,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that come from Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>which come from Christ, being ours,</hi> theſe alſo are comforts in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. There is no fiery ſword to keep out of this Paradiſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Doth not the Apoſtle conclude thoſe great priviledges of Juſtification, of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in that ſtate, of conqueſt over all ſpiritual enemies, and that from ſuch general grounds, as all the people of God may claim to it, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Christ died,</hi> and becauſe <hi>Christ is riſen;</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>given us Chriſt, and how then not with him all things elſe?</hi> Is there any believer ſo weak, ſo contemptible, that Chriſt did not die for, and riſe for? Is there any to whom the Father hath not given Chriſt? If ſo, you ſee, that what comforted <hi>Paul</hi> may comfort you. It is a vain Poſition of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh ſo aſſuredly in that condition, becauſe of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelation that he had, that Chriſt was his; for he grounds his perſwaſion upon thoſe general arguments which belong to every godly man. Chriſt then, and his preſence, with all his benefits, is a cordial to every believer. This Sunne of Righteouſneſſe ariſeth with healing in his wings to the leaſt believer; as well as the greateſt: The The Dwarfe as well as the Gyant may hold this pearle in his hand. But</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, beſides ſuch general comforts, which are (as ſome <note place="margin">Of the ſpecial and particular grounds of comfort.</note> ſay of <hi>Manna)</hi> anſwering all dainties, and was to every mans palate, that which he moſt delighted in: There are ſpecial and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for ſpecial and particular temptations. So that as every diſeaſe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a peculiar remedy, ſo every temptation a proper comfort: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſpecial comfort will not ſerve one in his temptation, which doth another in a different one. And hence it is, that it is an art of arts, and much heavenly wiſdome is required, to adminiſter the proper comfort for ſuch a grief. This makes <hi>Caſuistical Divinity,</hi> which is applied wholly to rectifie and comfort a wounded conſcience, more difficult than <hi>Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> is. The afflicted ſoul hath its <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>its deeps;</hi> and Satan alſo in their temptations hath his deeps likewiſe: Inſomuch that it is choice pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to give the proper cordial, and to find out the true way of comforting ſuch, yet though there be ſpecial comforts in ſpecial ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet all the godly that are in like temptations, may, and ought to take the like comforts. That which hath done any godly man good under ſuch an exerciſe, may do thee alſo good, if thou art not froward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us conſider, Why thoſe arguments which ſome godly <note place="margin">The grounds of the point.</note> men have found powerfull to comfort them, ſhould alſo be very conducible to others. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe all the Godly they are</hi> (as I may ſo ſay) <hi>Ejuſdem ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciei.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Becauſe all godly men are of the ſame nature.</note> They have all the ſame ſubſtantial ſundamentall worke of grace in their hearts. That as you ſee all men have the ſame ſpecifical <hi>humane Nature,</hi> though there be many individual properties, and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thus all the godly do partake of the ſame <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> They are all borne of God; they are all become new creatures. Although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the manner of converſion, and the degrees of grace; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo experiences of Gods favour and love in theſe things, there may be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48709:110"/>
much variation, yet in the main, as they all have the image of God, and ſo are like him: So they are alſo like one another. It's the common faith; it's the common love; it's the common Image of God, which they all doe partake of. So that godly men, though they may differ in their gifts, in degrees of graces, in their judgements and opinions, yet becauſe the Image of God is ſtampt on them all, there is a likeneſſe and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude between one another: What one feeleth, the other feeleth: How one is affected, the other is affected; they underſtand one another; they do (as it were) ſee themſelves in one another. We have an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Prov. 27. 19. As face anſwereth face in water, ſo the heart of man to man.</hi> There is a two-fold expoſition of this place, and that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Some ſay, it is brought to ſhew the falſhood and deceitfulneſſe of mans heart. That as in water, there is not a true repreſentation of the face, ſo one mans heart is not truly known to another. Others they goe on the contrary, As (ſay they) the face of a man, and the reflexion of it in the water are alike; ſo is the heart of man to man, that is of one friend to another. Therefore a friend is <hi>Alter Ego:</hi> They have all things common, one ſoul (as it were) and one heart. Now if this be true of moral friendſhip, that their hearts are fo alike, how much more of the people of God, who are all made <hi>one in the Lord, cis,</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. They are all but one Perſon; their hearts muſt needs anſwer one another. Let a godly man read <hi>David's Pſalmes,</hi> wherein he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally declare what the workings of his ſoul were: will not a godly man ſay, he ſpeaketh his heart, his doubts, his complaints? Seeing then there is the ſame fundamental work of grace in all, no wonder if what is ſuitable to one, is alſo to another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another ground of the Doctrine is, <hi>From the ſameneſſe and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Becauſe all have the ſame ſpirit.</note> 
                  <hi>identity of that Spirit of God, which enliveneth all, and worketh in all.</hi> For as it is with the body, though it hath different parts, yet all thoſe are informed and animated by the ſame ſoul. It is not one ſoul that informeth the arms, another the feet, but it's one and the ſame ſoul that informeth all. Thus it is alſo with all the people of God, they may differ much in externals, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, their eſtate; yea in internals alſo, in illumination and ſanctification, yet it is the ſame Spirit of God, that liveth and worketh in them all. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame root give nouriſhment to all of them, they all grow upon the ſame ſtock; if the ſame ſpirit diffuſe it ſelf through all, no wonder if what comforts one may alſo comfort another; no wonder if the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes revive one that doth another. He ſaid, <hi>Homo ſum, &amp; nihil hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani alienum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He was a man; and ſo nothing of a man was ſtrange to him.</hi> Thus thou art a believer, a new creature, and ſo nothing that is proper to ſuch, ſhould be ſtrange to thee.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, <hi>Seeing they are all animated by the ſame Spirit, which is a</hi> Comforter, <hi>then it would follow, they are all comforted alike, all have joy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but experience confuteth that: Two have the Spirit of God, and one is comforted, the other is dejected, walking in darkneſſe; ſo that you would ſay, certainly the ſame Spirit is not in both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwer is, Though the Spirit of God, which is a <hi>Comforter</hi> be in all the godly, yet it is a free agent, he diſpenceth this voluntarily as he pleaſeth. And again, Though the Spirit of God in the godly encline to comfort, yet it is in an ordered and appointed way. If thou art unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, froward, then thou reſiſteſt the Spirit of God within thee. The <hi>Jewes</hi> have a Proverb, <hi>Super maeſtum non cadit Spiritus Sanctus,</hi> which in a good ſenſe may be true. As it is in matter of Doctrine, ſo it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48709:110"/>
in reſpect of Conſolation. All the godly have the ſame Spirit, whoſe work it is <hi>to lead into truth;</hi> yet what wonderfull differences in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be amongſt them that have the ſame Spirit, yet they all hold the foundation, becauſe the Spirit of God doth communicate it ſelf by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and in meaſure, to one more, to another leſſe. Thus it is alſo in reſpect of Conſolation; though they have the ſame Spirit of comfort, yet the out-goings of this, are in one more than the other. And why ſhould it ſeem a ſtrange thing, for all the godly under the Goſpel to have the ſame Spirit, ſeeing the holy ones under the Old Teſtament, and thoſe under the New are led by the ſame Spirit? Whatſoever <hi>Marcionites</hi> of old, and <hi>Socinians</hi> of late ſay to the contrary, as appeareth notably, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 13. We having the ſame Spirit of faith, as it is written, I believe, and therefore have ſpoken, we alſo believe, and therefore ſpeak, ſo we alſo believe, and therefore rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another ground of the Doctrine is, <hi>Becauſe the main argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Becauſe promiſes are made alike to all.</note> 
                  <hi>of comfort promiſed in the Word, are not upon perſonal conſiderations, neither are particular priviledges, but from that common reaſon which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to every believer. Paul</hi> is comforted, not becauſe <hi>Paul,</hi> not because an Apoſtle. So <hi>David</hi> findeth God <hi>putting gladneſſe into his heart,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a King, not becauſe a Prophet, but because <hi>godly.</hi> If therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts (Fundamental, I mean) are given upon a publick intereſt, which belongs to all the godly, then it followeth, what comforts one, may, and ſhould comfort another. The Scripture which was ſpoken peculiarly to <hi>Joſhua, Paul</hi> applieth, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 13.) to every true believer: Chriſt is a Chriſt equally to one believer, as well as another. The godly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtrive about Chriſt, as thoſe women before <hi>Solomon</hi> about a childe, one ſaid, It was mine; and the other, It is mine; one cannot ſay, It is my Chriſt, and not thine; but Chriſt is every believers, and yet not divided.</p>
               <p>Let the Uſe be of <hi>Direction</hi> to the godly, In their application of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, not to obſerve perſonal conſiderations ſo much. To ſay a <hi>Paul</hi> may take comfort, a <hi>David</hi> may, but ſhall ſuch an one as I? This is to impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate where God hath made common.</p>

               <p>THe Apoſtle doth ſtill amplifie that neceſſary and ſpecial truth, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Gods comforting thoſe who are in trouble.</hi> For the troubles which do conſtantly follow the waies of Chriſt, are a great ſtumbling block and offence to many.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <note place="margin">The ſufferings of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in us.</note> is ſometimes uſed for the <hi>affections of ſinne,</hi> as <hi>Rom. 7. 5. Gal.</hi> 5. 24. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to <hi>Paul</hi> in another ſenſe, for he ſuffered and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under them: But here in the text, and in many other places, it's applied to <hi>afflictions and ſufferings.</hi> This is of various acception, for ſometimes it may be taken <hi>ſubjectively,</hi> for thoſe ſufferings which Chriſt himſelf indured. For though he was without ſinne, yet being our Surety, he ſuffered for that; yea, he ſuffered every way, God and man: ſo that his ſufferings were more dreadfull then the ſufferings of all men put together. In theſe ſufferings is contained the treaſure of all our peace and joy, of which the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abundantly and fully: But with this our text doth not meddle.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the next place, <hi>The ſufferings of Chriſt</hi> may be underſtood <note place="margin">What is meant by the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt.</note> indeed of <hi>thoſe he is affected with:</hi> but yet it is in his Members, not in his own Perſon. This is a very comfortable truth, that the ſufferings of a godly man for Chriſts Cauſe, Chriſt accounts them as his ſufferings; he taketh it as done to himſelf. Thus Chriſt, though glorified in Heaven, ſaith, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Act. 9. 4, 5. Chriſt is impriſoned, Chriſt is buffetted,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:48709:111"/>
Chriſt is reproached, and mocked in them. As it is comfortable to the godly, ſo it is as terrible to all thoſe who trouble and revile the godly for Chriſts ſake, as too many do, though they think with <hi>Pilate,</hi> to waſh their hands, and ſay, they are innocent. I mean the carnal and prophane ones of the world, whoſe rage, if God did not reſtrain, would be as that <hi>Haman</hi> to the whole Nation of the Jews, not leave one alive. But this is not chiefly meant here, though this be not to be excluded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſufferings of Chriſt</hi> may be underſtood <hi>exemplarily, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Chriſt;</hi> That we ſuffer as he ſuffered. In which particular, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. we are ſaid to be <hi>conforme unto his Image. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 13. we are commanded to rejoyce, when we are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings: That is, when we have a communion and fellowſhip with him. <hi>For if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo be glorified with him.</hi> This is part of the meaning. But then</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which is the principal and chiefeſt meaning of the phraſe, is, to underſtand it <hi>cauſally, thoſe ſufferings we indure becauſe of Chriſt:</hi> For owning his way, for continuance in his Diſcipleſhip. For the way of Chriſt being contrary to the courſe of the world, hence it is, that they are ſtirred up as ſo many hornets: They are the Serpents ſeed, and are of their Father the devil, who was a murderer from the beginning; and therefore if the godly will cleave to Chriſt, they muſt expect no mercy from the world.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing in the Propoſition, is the attribute <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>abounds:</hi> It <note place="margin">What is meant by the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt abounding.</note> is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it <hi>comparatively</hi> to Chriſt, as if the meaning were, We ſuffer more then Chriſt. Chriſt indeed, ſaid of his Diſciples, they ſhould do greater works and miracles then he did, but it is impoſſible they ſhould ſuffer more then he did. For, his death was not only a <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> but a <hi>Propitiation,</hi> being <hi>a Sacrifice offered up for the ſinnes of many.</hi> The word then only ſheweth, That the Sons of God may not only ſuffer, but their ſufferings may <hi>abound,</hi> may <hi>overflow;</hi> ſo that both in number and weight, they may greatly exceed.</p>

               <p>The words thus explained, Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a true and faithfull owning of Christ and his way, is accompanied with</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle takes it here for granted; ſuppoſeth it as a received truth, that Chriſts way, and ſufferings, are alwaies together: As the Sun and ſhadow; as the Roſe and prickes. So that what was ſaid of Chriſt, is true alſo of every Member; <hi>It behoved him to ſuffer, and ſo enter into glory. Chriſtianus</hi> is <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Luther</hi> of old. I only adde in the Doctrine, <hi>A true and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed receiving of Chriſt:</hi> For, if ſo be we take only ſome truths, and ſome parts of Chriſts way, and leave thoſe which moſt enrage and trouble the world; if we take his Doctrine, and not his Diſcipline, his truth, and not his godly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the world is leſſe moved. So if of his truths, we take ſome that are more <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> and leave the reſt which are more <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>ſearching;</hi> if we go no further, we may have ſome good entertainment in the world. <hi>Si di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the Emperours, when preſſed to be a Chriſtian, ſaid, <hi>Fac me Epiſcopum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum &amp; ero Chriſtianus; Make me Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and I will be a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Thus when men think to ſerve <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mammon,</hi> all this while they will not ſuffer: Yea, therefore they take up the profeſſion of Chriſt (it may be) that they may not ſuffer. As in <hi>Mordechai</hi>'s time, when the Jews had power given to ſlay their enemies, many became Jews for fear; ſo they may Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans alſo. And laſtly, If they have not groſſe carnal ends, and ſo be diſſembling hypocrites, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was, and <hi>Julian</hi> for a while, as ſome think of him, that he was never conſcientiouſly, but politiquely a Chriſtian, to pleaſe his Uncle, and ſo obtain the Empire at laſt; yet if they do own Chriſt in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cuſtomary general way only, they may eſcape ſufferings: But to follow Chriſt exactly, powerfully, preciſely and ſingularly, againſt the faſhion of the world; to get the Kingdom of Heaven by violence; to put out his right eye, and to cut off his right hand: he that will be thus a Chriſtian indeed, he ſhall have ſufferings enough; and that not only from the world, but even from ſuch who profeſſe Chriſt in Name, but deny him in Power. What is more ordinary, then to ſee a titular and nominal Chriſtian, to hate and abhor a reall, lively and powerfull Chriſtian? and only becauſe he is more ſtrict and forward in the waies of Chriſt then he is. Thus then you muſt underſtand the Doctrine of one; Who is a Chriſtian <hi>in Power,</hi> as well as <hi>in Name;</hi> of one who doth not divide Chriſt, but taketh all of him; of one who is not a flatterer, but a Friend to him: That ſaith to Chriſt, as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi, I will not leave thee, but where thou liveſt, I will live.</hi> One that accounteth Chriſt a Pearl, and ſells all, parts with all his luſts, his pleaſures and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to have Chriſt. Such an one as this, can no more be free from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this world, then a Dove be quiet among Hawks, or a Lamb among Wolves.</p>
               <p>To underſtand this, conſider, <note place="margin">Propoſitions declaring the truth of the Doctrine. 1. A Saints ſufferings may be as extenſive as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the ſufferings for Chriſts ſake, are as various and as extenſive as any comforts we have, that we may be deprived off.</hi> So that it's a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental qualification in every Diſciple of Chriſt, to love him before Father or Mother, yea life it ſelf: For if Chriſt be not preferred before the deareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts we have, one time or other, we ſhall be endangered to betray Chriſt, and rather deny him then ſuffer for him, which is a moſt dreadfull condition. I mean, it is very terrible to be in the number of thoſe, whoſe hearts are ſo glewed to theſe earthly things, that they cannot ſuffer for Chriſt; they cannot part with all, when he calls for it: But the Diſciple of Chriſt, muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſuffer in any thing, and at any time. Sometimes the ſufferings are more extream and grievous, ſometimes leſſe, and more eaſie. The former is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 32. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The greater are, <hi>impriſonment,</hi> or <hi>baniſhments,</hi> or <hi>death</hi> it ſelf: And commonly, death for Chriſt, hath not been a meer ordinary death, but accompanied with thoſe torments and exquiſite pains, that could be invented. Inſomuch, that if you look over all Hiſtories, you cannot find any ſuch terrible and barbarous ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as the people of God have been put upon. And truly, there is no godly man, but he is to have a fundamental qualification for this. There are alſo leſſer ſufferings, which though called ſo comparatively to greater, yet in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are very bitter and grievous: Such are <hi>reproaches, ſcoffs,</hi> and <hi>deriſions. Heb.</hi> 11. they are called <hi>cruel mockings. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 14. when he had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of a <hi>fiery tryal,</hi> then he mentioneth <hi>reproaching for Chriſts ſake. Iſmael</hi> is ſaid to perſecute <hi>Iſaac,</hi> yet the Scripture called that <hi>playing with him.</hi> It was in ſcoffs and mocks, that this perſecution was; therefore thou art a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor by the tongue, as well as the hand, though thou doſt not caſt in priſon: Though thou doſt not bring wood, and kindle the fire at the ſtake, yet thy
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48709:112"/>
flouts, thy deriſions, thy mockings, theſe are a perſecution, and the godly in theſe ſuffer for Chriſt. I ſhall inſtance in one thing more, and that is <hi>their Names</hi> and <hi>Repute;</hi> in this Chriſtians have wonderfully ſuffered. Chriſt was traduced for <hi>an Impoſtor,</hi> for <hi>one that had a Devil,</hi> and doing the Miracles he did by <hi>Beelzebub the Prince of Devils; Paul</hi> was calumniated for <hi>a ſeditious and turbulent perſon; Athanaſius</hi> for an <hi>Adulterer.</hi> Theſe falſe calumnies put the Ancients upon their Apologeticals, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Athenagorus.</hi> Wicked men do firſt impoſe lyes and ſlanders upon thoſe who fear God, and when they have thus made them odious, then they think they do deſerve any puniſhment. What abominable lyes have the Papiſts forged and broached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin?</hi> Yea ſtill experience confirmeth it, that whoſoever will live godly, prophane and ungodly perſons will divulge a thouſand falſe reports concerning them. And herein they muſt look to ſuffer, and not be troubled for it. The Stars are never the leſſe glorious, though Aſtronomers have given ugly names to them; the <hi>Bear,</hi> and the <hi>Draggons tayl,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we ſee, that he who will be Chriſts Diſciple, muſt be above riches, honours, liberty, a good Name, yea above life it ſelf; ſaying to Chriſt, as they to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Thou art worth ten thouſand of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Although it is the portion of all the Members of Chriſt to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. At ſome time their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings abound more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 
                  <hi>for him, yet at ſometime the ſtorm is more terrible then at others.</hi> Sometimes we hear the Church complaining, that <hi>they were as ſheep for the ſlaughter, killed all the day long:</hi> but at other times God gave more reſpite. Who hath not heard of the <hi>ten perſecutions?</hi> not that there were not farre more then ten, but becauſe they were moſt general, and commanded by the will of thoſe who then had power. So that ſuffering times are various, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods diſpenſation: He maketh the moſt bitter ſtorm many times to be but ſhort. As in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes; after which came a long calm, and Halcyon daies. <hi>Nubecula eſt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of his troubles, <hi>It is a little ſtorm, it will quickly be over.</hi> But although thoſe publique times of ſuffering be not alwaies, yet it is very hard, if ever, to ſee one that liveth godly, not to ſuffer from thoſe that are evil, one way or other. Every <hi>Abel</hi> will have a <hi>Cain,</hi> every <hi>Iſaac,</hi> an <hi>Iſmael.</hi> What though you do not ſuffer from the Pagans or heretiques without, yet how greatly do ye ſuffer from the prophane and ungodly within? Every prophane man, though he ſhrowd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the name of Chriſt, yet he is of an Antichriſtian ſpirit, if not doctrinally, yet practically, and in deed. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaking of the bitter times by Paganiſh perſecution, and then of more bitter by hereticall, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the third and moſt bitter of all, to be in the evil and ungodly manners of thoſe who are within the Church. <hi>Heu domine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>qui ſunt in Ecclesiâ pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, ſunt in perſecutione primi.</hi> There is then a ſuffering for Chriſt, though not to blood; and if every godly man do not thus ſuffer, let him fear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be not a man pleaſer; whether he fear not man more then God; whether therefore he be not applauded as a wiſe man, as a moderate man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not indeed a zealous godly man againſt ſinne in his place. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heathen could ſay, <hi>How is he a good man, who is not trouble ſome to, and hated by an evil man?</hi> Therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Wo be to you, when all men ſpeak well of you,</hi> Luk. 6. 26. Some obſerve the connexion the Apoſtle uſeth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11, 12. for having in the 11 <hi>verſe</hi> exhorted to a faithfull and diligent diſcharge of thoſe Offices we are betruſted with, preſently exhorts to <hi>patience about afflictions,</hi> becauſe one will neceſſarily cauſe the other. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. when Chriſt giveth his Apoſtles Commiſſion to <hi>preach,</hi> he doth withall admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <note place="margin">3. To ſuffer for Chriſt is very grievous to fleſh and blood.</note> them of the <hi>hatred</hi> they ſhall meet with. Light will be offenſive to ſore eyes, and ſalt will make wounds to ſmart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>To ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, is very tedious and grievous to fleſh and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48709:113"/>
blood.</hi> It's becauſe of thoſe reproaches, and many times dangers, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the way of Chriſt, that it is ſuch a ſtumbling block to many: They like the Crown of Glory well, but they like not the Crown of Thornes. If Chriſts way was a broad way; they might have Chriſt and their honours, Chriſt and their luſts, Chriſt and their advantages; then they would be as forward to runne out and meet Chriſt, as they did from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> crying <hi>Hoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nna to him.</hi> Therefore howſoever men have thouſands of pretences to keep off from the way of godlineſſe, and the faithfull owning of Chriſt, they have many wide gates of diſtinction to go out at, when danger is at hand, yet it is fear of ſuffering that keepeth moſt off their duty. They like Chriſt well, till it cometh to be ſaid, as ſhe did to <hi>Moſes, Thou art a bloody husband to me:</hi> So Chriſt will have thy good name, thy eſtate, thy life; this makes thee prove an Apoſtate, and turn hypocrite. Oh the gulf of miſery, yea ſometimes of deſpair, that this fear of ſuffering hath put men upon! Therefore afflictions for Chriſts ſake, are ſo often called <hi>temptations,</hi> becauſe they will diſcover whether a man be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound for God, or not; whether they love Chriſt more then the creatures. Oh then, pray to God, that he leave thee not to this ſnare, to be afraid to ſuffer for doing what is good! This will prove bitter at the latter end. Do you not ſee among Officers, how fearfull to puniſh the drunkard, the Sabbath-breaker? they ſhall looſe their good word; they will do them deſpite and malice after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: Art not thou all this while afraid to ſuffer for Chriſt? He that ſuffers for doing that which is righteous, for puniſhing offenders, he ſuffers for Chriſt; (as is to be ſhewed.) Remember then, it's better ſuffering for Chriſt, which is our Crown and Glory, then ſuffering in Hell for ever, becauſe thou wouldſt not do the will of God.</p>

                  <hi>it as a moſt bleſſed and glorious thing, howſoever the world judge it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull.</hi> I ſhall not here enlarge my ſelf about the encouragements to ſuffer, when Chriſt calls for it; it is enough at this time, in the general, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, That God will not honour every one with perſecutions for himſelf; It is a great expreſſion of his grace and favour. Hence ſome Confeſſors, have deſired to be Martyrs, but God by his providence preſerved them, they
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48709:113"/>
have been greatly humbled, and dejected under this, as if it were for ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſinne and unworthineſſe in them, that God would not in that manner dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify them. Theſe are not words, and meer oratory, the Scripture is clear in proclaiming this for a title of favour, to be a ſufferer for Chriſt. <hi>Act. 5. 41.

Thy are to goorifie God in that behalf.</hi> If we could believe theſe Scripture truths, ſo much ſinfull fear and puſillanimity in the cauſe of Chriſt, might not be charged upon us, as too often it may be, we would not run from a duty accompanied with ſufferings, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did from the rod turned into a <hi>Serpent;</hi> neither ſhould we with <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenean,</hi> be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to bear the croſſe. That is obſerveable, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 19. If a man ſuffer for conſcience towards God:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; We tranſlate it, this is <hi>thankworthy.</hi> But happily that is not ſo proper; for, if a man ſhould ſuffer all the Martyrdomes that have been in his own body, yet God is not to thank him; he hath not ſuffered more then he ought to do. Neither do I know that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed in ſuch a ſenſe. Therefore it's better tranſlated, <hi>This is a favour;</hi> this is grace, if God bring us to ſuffer for a good conſcience towards him. If then thou art to ſuffer, either verbally, by mocks and ſlanders, or really, by miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and perſecutions; ſet the Crown of Glory, to the Crown of Thornes; ſet the honey, to the gall; ſet the honour with God, to the reproach amongſt men. That which the carnal heart is ſo afraid of, the Scripture makes matter of joy, and of glorifying God for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It being therefore ſo glorious a thing, it is good to inform you, <hi>What it is to ſuffer for Chriſt.</hi> For we may be the devils Martyrs, ſuffer as <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,</hi> or as <hi>buſybodies;</hi> ſuffer for hereſies, and the works of the fleſh, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and flatter our ſelves that we ſuffer for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to clear this, we muſt conſider what is required <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> on the <note place="margin">What it is to ſuffer for Chriſt. 1. <hi>Ex parte Objecti.</hi>
                  </note> behalf of the matter we ſuffer for. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is required <hi>ex parte ſubjecti;</hi> what qualifications ought to be in him who doth ſuffer for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And for the Object matter, the Scripture deſcribeth it in theſe Particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That what a man ſuffereth for, it muſt not be for any ſinne,</hi> that is <note place="margin">1. It muſt not be for any ſin.</note> juſtly puniſhable by the Law: It muſt not be for our folly and buſy medling in ſuch things wherein we have no call. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> cap. 3. 15, 16.) ſpeaketh notably to this; for giving the people of God in that Chapter, great encouragements to ſuffer, he cometh in with a caution, <hi>They muſt take heed for what they ſuffer:</hi> which is laid down poſitively, and then oppoſitly. Poſitively, <hi>as a Chriſtian;</hi> it muſt be for profeſſing and doing ſuch things as Chriſt requireth: Let it not be ſtrange fire, but the fire from the Altar. If thou wouldſt have comfort, it muſt be for doing that which as a Chriſtian thou art bound to do. And the oppoſite to this, is <hi>to ſuffer as a murderer,</hi> as a <hi>thief,</hi> or which is more general, as a <hi>buſybody</hi> in other mens matters: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that is, <hi>one who buſily ſpyeth into, and medleth with thoſe things that he hath no call to;</hi> it's not his Office to deal in. Now this muſt not be underſtood, as the world will judge a man a <hi>buſybody.</hi> If a Miniſter, a Magiſtrate, or any in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice be zealous againſt ſin, and ſee to the puniſhing of it, the prophane ones of the world call this an <hi>an hot buſy medling.</hi> So if private Chriſtians cannot bear the impieties they ſee committed in the places where they live, but do
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48709:114"/>
faithfully and boldly admoniſh and reprove ſuch offenders; and if this doth no good, then they will proceed further, to the Magiſtrate and Officers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſuch, that ſinne may be puniſhed, God honoured, and publique judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevented. If (I ſay) private Chriſtians be thus ſtirring (as they ought to be, unleſſe they will have other mens ſins lie at their doors, and they become thereby very guilty;) then what an out-cry is made? theſe are facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, troubleſome, diſquieting follows. So that to judge who is a <hi>buſy-body,</hi> and when a man is guilty of it, you muſt have recourſe to the Scripture, and to ſound caſuiſtical Divinity, applying the general rules of Scripture to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and not to the common voice and noiſe of people in the world. That good zealous Prophet for God <hi>Eliſah,</hi> who becauſe he burned with fire for God, had a wonderfull reward thereof, to be carried up in a fiery Charriot to Heaven, yet becauſe he would not endure the ungodlineſſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebell,</hi> what is ſaid to him? <hi>Then art the troubler of Iſrael.</hi> They condemn him for a <hi>buſy-body,</hi> whereas indeed <hi>Ahab</hi> by his wickedneſſe (as the Prophet ſaid) was the <hi>troubler of the Land.</hi> In ſuffering then for Chriſt, we ſee much prudence as well as zeal is required; yet ſo, as not to regard the cenſure of the world: For, who ever ſuffered for Chriſt, and their perſecutors did not repreſent them ſo odiouſly, as that they might ſeem to deſerve it? This is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the object matter, The Scripture expreſſeth it another time, <note place="margin">2. It muſt be for the name of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Name of Chriſt.</hi> Mat. 19. 29. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall for ſake houſes, lands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for my Names ſake.</hi> Job. 15. 21. <hi>All theſe things will they do to you for my Names ſake.</hi> What is <hi>Christs name?</hi> not only the Perſon of Chriſt himſelf; but as the <hi>Name of God,</hi> is that whereby God is known, ſo is the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt. Yea, under this, is comprehended thoſe Doctrines, and that Faith which Chriſt had delivered to us. The truths of Chriſt are to be dearer to us then ourlives. Hence it was, that Chriſtianity hath amazed the world, with thoſe millions and millions of Martyrs, that have been for the faith of Chriſt. It was a wicked opinion of the Priſcillianiſts of old, <hi>That a man migh lye, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, and forſwear the truths of Chriſt, bow to Idols, and communicate with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in any bodily worſhip, ſo as they kept the true faith in their hearts.</hi> But this is directly oppoſite to Scripture. <hi>Rom. 10. 16. With the heart man believeth, and with the month confeſſion is made to ſalvation. To ſalvation:</hi> So that a man cannot be ſaved, though he doth in his heart believe, if he do not, when it is <hi>caſus confeſſionis, a caſe of confeſſion, confeſſe</hi> alſo <hi>with his mouth</hi> the ſame faith. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 4. The true worſhippers of God in <hi>Eliahs</hi> time, are deſcribed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their inward grace, but externally alſo, that they did not <hi>bow their knee to Baal.</hi> It is true, there is a difference between profeſſion and confeſſion ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken: As <hi>Cyprian, Maluit nos Dous confiteri fidem, non profiteri.</hi> To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, is to do it ultroneouſly of our own accord, when we are not called to it; as ſome of the Martyrs would do, crying out, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum, I am a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> for which they were put to death. And this could not be excuſed in them, unleſſe we ſay, an extraordinary heroical frame of ſpirit was at that time infuſed into them by the Holy Ghoſt. This voluntary profeſſion, when danger is, is not required: Yea, in leſſer truths, we are not to profeſſe them ſo, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the faith of others. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 14. 22. Haſt thou faith? have it to thy ſelf.</hi> But then, in caſe of confeſſion, when the glory of God, the good of the Church, and our own ſalvation requireth it, then we are to confeſſe the truths of Chriſt, though we looſe all. It is the great glory attributed by <hi>Paul</hi> to Chriſt, that (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13.) before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> he witneſſed a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. To ſuffer then for Chriſt, it is to looſe all for his Truth, for his Faith, when he requireth. Therefore though Heretiques may glory in their ſufferings, and they be canonized as Saints amongſt their Diſciples, yet they will be ſound to have loſt their blood in vain, and that they were not the Lord Chriſts, but the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48709:114"/>
devils Martyrs. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old, yea thoſe <hi>Circumcelliones,</hi> that would kill themſelves, and like mad men, would make others kill them, did triumph in the name of Martyrs. The <hi>Meſſaliani</hi> alſo, becauſe they were puniſhed for their Idols, called themſelves <hi>Martyriani,</hi> the <hi>Martyrians;</hi> as if they only were the Martyrs. How greatly are the Popiſh Calenders filled with their ſaints, when yet ſome of them dyed of deſperate and high rebellions and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? So that this alwaies falleth out, as men are perſwaded of their way, ſo they judge it true perſecution or falſe. <hi>Haſtia</hi> did truly call the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, <hi>Perſecutiones ſteriles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>barren and fruitleſſe;</hi> as loſing the crown of glory, though they boaſted of them. On the other ſide, the rigid <hi>Lutherans</hi> did condemn our Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, (becauſe they dyed againſt that error, That Chriſt was bodily preſent in the Sacrament;) yea, and called them <hi>Martyres Diaboli, The Devils Martyrs.</hi> This (I confeſſe) is more grievous many times, then all the perſecutions of the adverſaries, when thoſe who are of the ſame general profeſſion, yet for ſome particular differences, ſhall ſo uncharitably cenſure one another: But this is no new thing in the Church of God. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> though they blaſpheme the Deity of Chriſt, and their doctrine is not ſimply hereſie, but blaſphemy alſo, yet they will admire their ſufferings, as if for Chriſt alſo. The <hi>Polonian Gentleman,</hi> that writ <hi>Socinus</hi> his life, would preferre him above <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> As for <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the Father of Jeſuites, we have nothing to do with him; but that he ſhould preferre him above <hi>Luther</hi> for the greatneſſe of his faith, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Luthers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine at the firſt had many to applaud it, but</hi> Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius <hi>had few or none to encourage him:</hi> Though we might ſay, <hi>Luthers</hi> was univerſally hated, the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then ſubject to the Pope, yet that can be nothing with that writer, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that pride and vain-glory, may make all a mans ſufferings to be fewel to it. Thus you ſee, how that all ſuffering parties in Religion, will pretend to Chriſt, and plead they ſuffer for him; but as Chriſt is Chriſt, though there have riſen many falſe Chriſts, ſo ſuffering and perſecution for Chriſt is truly ſo; and ſome there are, and they only, who can claim this honour, though others do glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly pretend to it. It is a true rule of <hi>Auſtins, Cauſa non paena facit Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrem, Not the puniſhment, but the cauſe makes a Martyr.</hi> Even as <hi>Cauſa, non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratio, facit ſchiſmaticum:</hi> It muſt be indeed the Doctrine of Chriſt, not our opinions and preſumptions we ſuffer with.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Scripture expreſſeth this, <hi>Suffering for righteouſneſſe ſake.</hi> He <note place="margin">3. For righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſake.</note> that ſuffereth for doing that which is righteous, ſuffereth for Chriſt. <hi>Mat. 5. 10. If ye be perſecuted for righteouſneſſe ſake, bleſſed are ye.</hi> This is made the ſame with ſuffering <hi>for Chriſts ſake.</hi> This is good to obſerve, leſt we ſhould think, that then we only ſuffer for Chriſt, when the matter we are troubled for, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt himſelf, or his truth and ordinances; ſomething that is immediately terminated upon Chriſt. No: this is to be extended farther. For, when a Magiſtrate is zealous to rebuke ſinne, and put it to ſhame, if he be maligned for this, <hi>he ſuffereth for Chriſt.</hi> So, if a private Chriſtian ſet himſelf, in a lawfull way, againſt all the impieties that abound where he liveth, and thereupon all his neighbours hate and oppoſe him, <hi>he ſuffers for Chriſt:</hi> And all becauſe it's for righteouſneſſe. Inſomuch that thou maieſt take much comfort herein, as one <hi>Martyr</hi> did, That it is not for any wickedneſſe of thine, any wrong or injury thou haſt done them; only becauſe thou haſt had a zeal for God and his glory: therefore it is that they riſe up with ſuch malice againſt thee. And let this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage all ſuch, who deſire to have all ungodlineſſe and diſhonour to God by ſinne, be wholly rooted out; though in this labour they have many oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and much hatred, yet remember it is <hi>for Chriſt.</hi> It is true indeed, that beſides meer righteouſneſſe, there muſt be alſo a knowledge of Chriſt: <hi>For without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11. 3. And therefore, though
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48709:115"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtides</hi> the juſt, was baniſhed for righteouſneſſe, and <hi>Socrates</hi> put to death, for maintaining there was but one God; yet theſe cannot be ſaid to <hi>ſuffer for Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they had no knowledge of him: Seeing Chriſt is only in the Church, therefore there cannot be any true ſuffering for him, but in the Church.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In reſpect of the object matter, Then we ſuffer for Chriſt, when we are perſecuted <hi>for keeping a good conſcience,</hi> and will not break the peace thereof <note place="margin">4. For a good conſcience.</note> for all the advantages in the world. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 16. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the <hi>having of a good conſcience,</hi> to be equivalent to <hi>ſuffering for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake,</hi> and alſo <hi>for the Name of Chriſt.</hi> This good conſcience conſiſts in this, That whereas the enemies and perſecutors ſpeak all evil of us as evil doers, they may at laſt be aſhamed for ſuch falſe accuſations. Here you ſee, none e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſecuted the Church of God, but they laid foul things to their charge: That as they did put the Chriſtians ſometimes in Bear-skins, to make the dogs tear them with the greater rage, ſo alſo they have turned their names into Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, Schiſmaticks, and every odious title, that ſo they might be the more juſtified in their cruel waies. Now then, to ſuffer with, and for a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is to be innocent from all theſe calumnies; that we dare appeal to God, as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>For which of the good works do ye ſtone me?</hi> So, for what good is it that I have done, you reproach, you revile and perſecute me? But when we ſay a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> we mean, that which is truly ſo, and informed out of Gods Word; otherwiſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, he <hi>had a good conſcience,</hi> while he was a Phariſee, and thought he was bound to do againſt Chriſt what he did. So, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deluded conſciences may indure much miſery, yea death it ſelf, with a <hi>good conſcience</hi> thus farre, that they do not go againſt any light thereof: They are not as ſome Heretiques, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſelf-condemned,</hi> as it is commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; No, they may think they are bound to ſuffer as they do: Yea, if they ſhould recant their errors, though never ſo damnable, while their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is perſwaded to the contrary, they would ſinne againſt God, (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they renounce an error materially, but becauſe they do that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally appeareth a truth to them) and it may be bring much horror and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or upon their own conſciences. It is not enough therefore to make a man a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer for Chriſt, if in a falſe way, becauſe he is perſwaded ſo; his conſcience doth not tell him to the contrary; he hath much comfort doing as he doth; whereas, if he ſhould do otherwiſe, he ſhould have no peace: For, conſcience is but an inferiour Judge, and is no further to command, then guided by the Word of God; and when it is ſo, then whoſoever will not pleaſe men, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all hardſhip, rather then <hi>wound this conſcience,</hi> this man <hi>ſuffers for Chriſt.</hi> Thus you ſee what it is to ſuffer for Chriſt, in the Scripture expreſſion, and let it be thy earneſt prayer to God, to have a preparedneſſe of heart thus to ſuffer. Oh, conſider how much Chriſt ſuffered for thee, both from God and man! He ſuffered in his Name in all reproach and ignominy, dying a moſt accurſed death, and ſhalt thou be ſo tender and delicate, as not to indure the mocks and rages of men for him? Shall Chriſt be in <hi>cruce,</hi> and thou in <hi>luce?</hi> Chriſt in <hi>convitiis,</hi> and thou in <hi>conviviis?</hi> Chriſt in <hi>patibulo,</hi> and thou in <hi>Paradiſo?</hi> (as <hi>Gerhard</hi> expreſſeth it.) Oh fear left this prove dreadfull at the latter end!</p>

               <p>WHat it is to <hi>ſuffer for Chriſt</hi> ex parte objects, <hi>in respect of the matter for which,</hi> hath already been diſpatched. We now proceed to ſhew, <hi>What is required</hi> ex parte ſubjecti; <hi>What are the qualifications neceſſary in him, who doth truly ſuffer for Chriſt.</hi> When we read of ſo many glorious priviledges promiſed to ſuch as are troubled for Chriſts ſake, you muſt know, that their bare ſuffering, no not for that which is righteous, is enough to entitle them to this bleſſedneſs; but there muſt be the Adverb as well as the Nown: it muſt not only be <hi>pro bono;</hi> but <hi>benè,</hi> for that which is good; but alſo in a good manner for ſuffering and martyrdome it ſelf; as all other duties is not integrated of all its cauſes; as it is not enough to pray, to hear, though theſe for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be commanded, but they muſt be done in an holy and ſpiritual manner. Thus it is not enough to ſuffer, or to be perſecuted, and that for Chriſts ſake, unleſſe alſo we have that holy frame of heart in ſuffering, which Gods word doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>Let us then examine this truth, <hi>viz. What are the requiſites to qualifie a true ſufferer for Chriſt?</hi> When his cauſe is good, his heart, his ends alſo muſt be good. Therefore that ordinary ſaying, <hi>Cauſa non poena facit Martyrem, The cauſe not the puniſhment doth make a Martyr,</hi> muſt be further limited; for the cauſe doth not, unleſſe there be alſo thoſe concomitant graces in the ſubject, as well as there is truth in the object; and we ſhall find this ſuffering temper to have as curious ingredients into it, as there was into that precious ointment, made for the high Prieſt alone, and no wonder, for it is the higheſt pitch of love we can arrive at, to ſuffer for him, and it is the moſt contrary to fleſh and blood: So that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>one can do this for Chriſt, but ſuch who are wonderfully enabled by him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Therefore in a ſufferer for Chriſt, there is required Faith in the eminent and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What are the qualifications of thoſe who ſuffer truly for Chriſt. 1. Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>powerfull actings thereof.</hi> It is as impoſſible to ſuffer without faith, as a bird to flie without wings. It's faith alone that can remove theſe mountains in the Sea, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Thoſe great exploits the Saints did, yea and thoſe wonderfull ſufferings they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, is attributed by the Apoſtle, wholly to their <hi>faith.</hi> Now this <hi>faith</hi> requiſite to true ſuffering for Chriſt, emptieth it ſelf into two chanels; there muſt be a <hi>Dogmatical Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Fiducial Faith.</hi> A <hi>Dogmatical Faith</hi> is that whereby a man is aſſured of the truths be ſuffereth for as divine, and becauſe of Divine Authority.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48709:116"/>
Hence alſo it is that a meer Opinioniſt or Sceptick in Religion, will never ſuffer for Chriſt, becauſe he hath no faith, but opinion in Religion. So likewiſe thoſe who are of a Religion meerly for humane Authority ſake, becauſe of the cuſtome and Laws where they live, commanding ſuch a Religion; as thoſe amongſt the <hi>Graecians,</hi> that were called <hi>Melchitae,</hi> becauſe they followed the Religion the King was of (though indeed the Orthodox were ſo branded by the Heretical party, <hi>Vide</hi> Hornbeck. <hi>de Graecis.)</hi> Theſe cannot ſuffer truly for Chriſt. Indeed they may ſuffer for their Religion, as it's local and traditional to them, as <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> do; but yet this is not from faith, which doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily relate to divine teſtimony. This then cuts off the glory which Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and erroneous perſons may boaſt of; if they ſuffer <hi>truly,</hi> they ſuffer with a <hi>true Faith;</hi> if they have a <hi>true Faith</hi> that can be proved and demonſtrated out of Gods Word. And when we ſay a <hi>Dogmatical Faith,</hi> that muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in reſpect of its compleatneſſe and integrity, as to Fundamentals. No man can ſuffer truly for Chriſt, that peremptorily denieth any I undamental; if he hold the foundation, though he build hay and ſtubble, ſuperſtructive errours, yet if he do not demoliſh any of the foundation ſtones, he may <hi>be ſaved, but ſo as by fire.</hi> And truly is this charity be not allowed, we ſhall ſcarce find any perſon or Church truly ſuffering for Chriſt. For where hath there been ſuch a ſound faith in Fundamentals, <hi>circa-</hi>fundamentals, and <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-</hi>fundamentals, as that there hath not been any ſpot or wrinkle in the face of the Church. This prerogative belongs to the Church in Heaven. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffer for Chriſt, who are perſecuted for his truths, though happily they erre in many things not neceſſary to ſalvation. But if they deny any Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals (I do not ſay doubt, and that for a ſeaſon, as the Apoſtles did about the nature of Chriſts Kingdome, and his Reſurrection) and that with perſevering obſtinacy, then though he ſuffer for one Fundamental, yet becauſe he denieth another, he doth in effect deſtroy the whole building of Chriſt. Thus when a <hi>Macedonian</hi> ſuffered for holding the Deity of Chriſt, being put to death by an <hi>Arian,</hi> the primitive Church never judged him a <hi>Martyr,</hi> becauſe he denied the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt. There is therefore required a ſound <hi>Dogmatical. Faith;</hi> for which cauſe ſome have doubted, Whether the Church did well in making all thoſe infants, which were killed by <hi>Herod,</hi> becauſe of Chriſt, in rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning them among <hi>Martyrs.</hi> For they did not know any thing of Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be many of their parents had any true faith about him. Certainly ly they cannot be called <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>Sufferers</hi> for Chriſt in an active fenſe, but paſſively only.</p>
               <p>The ſecond act of faith, is a <hi>fiducial dependance on the promiſe of God, and his Power, which is able to raiſe up the heart above all fears and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea to repreſent priſons, palaces, and coals of fire, beds of roſes, ſuch a tranſubſtantiating nature is faith of.</hi> It was <hi>faith,</hi> Heb. 11. which made <hi>Moſes</hi> eſteem the <hi>reproaches of Chriſt more than all the glory and honour which was in Pharaoh's court;</hi> eſpecially faith as it is <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for.</hi> As it maketh Heaven and glory preſent, ſo it's admirably quickning and enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the heart of him that ſuffereth. It is therefore called <hi>The ſhield of faith, which above all,</hi> or <hi>to all</hi> (as ſome expound) <hi>we are to take,</hi> as if no other part of the ſpiritual armoury would do any good, unleſſe we had faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 16. Hence when <hi>Peter</hi> was to undergo Satans winnowings, which were chiefly by perſecutions, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He prayed that his faith might not fail him,</hi> Luk. 22. 32. not his fortitude, patience or zeal, but his faith, becauſe this is the root; the tree can never fail as long as the root is good. It was want of faith made many in times of perſecution ſacrifice to Idols, and deliver the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be burnt. It was want of faith made <hi>Spira</hi> fall into ſo great an Apoſtaſie. Thus faith is the chief grace that inableth to ſuffer for Chriſt. This makes weak, ſtrong, and Lambs, Lions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:48709:116"/>
Secondly, Another qualification to ſuffer for Chriſt, is <hi>Love,</hi> a grace not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be exalted above ſaith, but yet as neceſſary in its ſphere, where it hath to do, as that is; and as faith, ſo this love required in every ſufferer doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it ſelf two wayes: There muſt be <hi>hearty love to God and Chriſt, for whom we ſuffer;</hi> and there muſt be <hi>love to man, yea to our enemies and perſecutors, or elſe we ſhall loſe the advantage of all our ſufferings.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh fully to this, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 3. Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing:</hi> And what charity is this? Even two-fold, Firſt, <hi>A love of God and Chriſt.</hi> If thou ſuffereſt becauſe of force and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, thou canſt not avoid it; this is not to ſuffer rightly. It muſt be true love to Chriſt and his glory, that thou preferreſt his glory above all thy comforts, even life it ſelf. And indeed this is the greateſt expreſſion of thy love to Chriſt, when thou canſt die for him, as Chriſt diſcovered his great love in dying for us. A man that doth not love Chriſt, cannot ſuffer for Chriſt. The ſecond act of charity is, <hi>To love our enemies, our perſecutours.</hi> While they are railing, we are to pray; while they are perſecuting, we are to bleſſe: and truly by this we are known to be Chriſts Diſciples, more than by enlargements, or any miracles. When one met with a Chriſtian, and falling upon him in a great rage, beating and buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, ſaying, <hi>What great thing did Chriſt ever do?</hi> The Chriſtian reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Even this, that though you beat and abuſe me, yet Chriſt hath taught me to pray for you.</hi> If therefore malice, and a revengefull ſpirit be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in thee, while thou ſuffereſt, Oh conſider, this is not to ſuffer as Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is required in him that ſuffereth for Chriſt, Spiritual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Spiritual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ortitude and heavenly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> 
                  <hi>and courage.</hi> No ſuch enemy to this duty of ſuffering, as worldly fears and puſillanimity of ſpirit. Indeed there is a godly fear, whereby we have an holy jealouſie of our ſtrength, and therefore reſt alone upon Gods power: and this is an excellent preſervative againſt Apoſtaſie in the hour of temptation. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have been exceeding fearfull, have yet been more faithfull and ſtout in the hour of danger, then thoſe who have been more confident, as many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> will evidence. When <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, as to ſay, <hi>Though all men ſhould forſake thee, yet I will not:</hi> He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more cowardly than any. So that there is a good humble fear, whereby we renounce our own ſtrength, and this we are to preſerve. But then there is a carnal, worldly, natural and exceſſive fear, this is to be mortified. Now againſt this, Chriſtian courage is the proper help; but this is the gift of Gods Spirit. Therefore none can ſuffer for Chriſt, but ſuch who have the Spirit of God ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them. It's a gift to ſuffer not only by way of honour, but alſo by way of power. Hence when <hi>Stephen</hi> and others were inabled to be bold againſt their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, they are ſaid <hi>to be filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And thus <hi>Timothy</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>to be ſtrong in the grace of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 1. <hi>and to endure hardneſſe as a good ſouldier of Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Epheſ. 6. 10. Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> It is true, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh of fortitude a moral vertue, deſpiſing deaths and dangers; but he was ignorant of God, and ſo giveth us a Gloworm in ſtead of a Star. Pray therefore for this holy courage in the way of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>To ſuffer for Chriſt there is required, An holy Wiſdome and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Holy wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> For it is not <hi>Chriſtian fortitude,</hi> unleſſe regulated by <hi>Chriſtian prudence.</hi> Diſcretion is the ſalt to ſeaſon all our Sacrifices: for to Sacrifices there was <hi>ſalt</hi> required, as well as <hi>fire.</hi> When our Saviour gave that admirable counſel, <hi>Be wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Doves,</hi> Matth. 10. 16. he ſheweth what an excellent temper even <hi>ad pondus</hi> a Chriſtian ſhould be of. The Serpent muſt not eat up the Dove, yet a Dove-like temper muſt be accompanied with wiſdome. Courage to ſuffer without wiſdome, is like <hi>Samſon</hi> without eyes, and many times did
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:48709:117"/>
more diſhonour God, then all ſufferings did honour him. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſliked the zeal of ſome, who demoliſhed the Heatheniſh Idols, of their own private ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, having no Authority thereunto. The indiſcretion of one <hi>Andas</hi> a Biſhop, ſetting fire on a <hi>Perſian</hi> Temple, where they worſhipped fire as a god, brought a ſad and ſore perſecution; and when the Biſhop was commanded to build it up again at his own charges, for his reſuſal he was put to death. Now ſaith an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Primitive Writer, I diſcommend him for his imprudence in demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple, but I admire his zeal that he would die rather than rebuild it.</hi> He then ſuffereth for Chriſt, that hath prudence and wiſdome to order his zeal, ſo that he ſuffer not for his own folly, but meerly for Chriſt. Only this is a very nice point, to diſtinguiſh prudence from carnal policy; but that is not my work now.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>We are alwayes to remember Patience, as that which is a ſpecial</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Patience.</note> 
                  <hi>qualifier of every one to ſuffer. You have need of patience,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 36. Therefore <hi>Heb. 6. 12. Faith and Patience</hi> are put together, as thoſe two which made the godly inherit the promiſes, <hi>Rom. 12. 12. Patient in tribulation.</hi> This holy patience is that which doth quiet and compoſe all the waves and ſtorms of the ſoul; it commands all diffident and unbelieving thoughts, all murmurings and repinings to be gone. Therefore it's ſaid, <hi>In patience poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe your ſouls.</hi> And <hi>Jam. 13. Let patience have its perfect work.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art called any wayes to ſuffer for Chriſt, take heed of fretting, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings, of unrulineſſe of heart; for impatience argueth a want both of faith in, and love of Chriſt. The <hi>Martyrs</hi> were admirable in the patience they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered under the moſt provoking torments; they ſuffered as if it had been in anothers body, and not their own.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>To ſuffer there is required a mortified heavenly heart, as to all earthly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. An heart mortified to all earthly comforts.</note> 
                  <hi>comforts and relations; not to know father, or mother, or life it ſelf comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the cauſe and glory of Chriſt.</hi> And this makes it ſo difficult to ſuffer. This hath made the Apoſtates, that have many times been in the Church. This hath filled the hearts of many with woe and wounds implacably: For their childrens ſake, for their lives ſake, they deny Chriſt and a good conſcience; and how can it be otherwiſe, while Earth is dearer than Heaven, when we eſteem the favour of men, more than the favour of God? This hath proved bitter wormwood to many at laſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>To ſuffer for Chriſt, there is required pure and holy motives.</hi> To loſe <note place="margin">7. Pure and holy motives.</note> all for Chriſts ſake, out of meer conſcience; that this is the only cauſe why we are in any trouble. We may read both in ſacred and prophane Hiſtories, how men have ſuffered even death it ſelf, only for vain-glory. All <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, they were ambitious and vain-glorious men. The very Heathen could make it <hi>Laudum immenſa cupido,</hi> as well as <hi>Amorpatriae.</hi> We would think it a madneſſe to loſe comforts and life for an airy bubble of windy glory, yet many have been thus tranſported: not only <hi>Philoſophus,</hi> but <hi>Haereticus eſt animal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae, vaniſſimum.</hi> If then it's not Scripture-grounds, but ambitious vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious principles that make thee to ſuffer, Chriſt doth not, will not provide ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar for thy bitter pils. Thus have we ſeen, what is required to ſuffer for Chriſt. Oh the difficulty of this duty! No wonder ſo much ſeed hath withered away, when the ſcorching Sunne of perſecution did ariſe! No wonder Chriſt hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Swallow-friends that endure with him the Summer time onely! No wonder few are lovers of Chriſt for Chriſts ſake. As <hi>Alexander</hi> had more <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Theſe are the Bees that follow for the honey-pot only. Now to all theſe we muſt adde this Caution, A Chriſtian that ſuffereth for Chriſt, though he have not thoſe qualifications in a perfect degree, but find corruption oppoſing every one of them: He muſt not therefore caſt away his confidence: for we can no more ſuffer perfectly for Chriſt, then do perfectly for him; and if
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48709:117"/>
our gracious works cannot juſtifie us, no more can our gracious ſufferings, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom is not meritorious. Though we ſhed our bloud for Chriſt, yet the blood of Chriſt muſt cleanſe that duty alſo. The <hi>Martyrs</hi> died only in reſting upon Chriſt for ſalvation; and no wonder the godly heart finds more imperfections in his ſufferings, more carnal fear and impatience then in other duties, becauſe this is the hardeſt ſervice Chriſt doth ever put his upon. What elſe is to be ſaid in this point, will come in in the next particulars.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond abſolute Propoſition in the Text is, <hi>That our comfort abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by Christ.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is rendred by ſome <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but more generally and fitly <hi>Conſolation.</hi> Though this be ſpoken in the ſingular number, and afflictions in the plural, yet this is to be underſtood collectively, as a treaſure that hath all kind of comforts in it, not one or two, but all. Therefore the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is here repeated again, <hi>aboundeth,</hi> which is to be underſtood, partly <hi>repletively,</hi> it filleth the hearts of thoſe that do ſuffer for Chriſt; and partly <hi>diffuſively,</hi> it extends alſo to the comfort of others. And then you have the cauſe of all this, <hi>By Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> who is the cauſe of their ſufferings, is alſo the cauſe of their comfort. As from the ſame root pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth both the Roſe and its pricks: Thus from Chriſt, the ſame Fountain cometh both bitter and ſweet. Were not this added, who would ſuffer for Chriſt, who would loſe all for him; but Chriſt hath ſo ordained it, that theſe ſufferings are advantagious to us; and though we loſe in the retail, yet we gain in the bulk and whole. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That as our ſufferings are for Chriſt, ſo by the ſame Christ are our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</hi>

               <p>Though he ſtrike with one hand, yet he ſupporteth with the other. If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid to the Prieſt who fled to him, many of them being ſlain at <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But to explain this, Let us conſider, <hi>In what respects comforts may be ſaid to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts abound by Chriſt. 1. Efficiently.</note> 
                  <hi>abound by Chriſt.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Efficiently;</hi> He being the ſame with God, is therefore a <hi>God of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</hi> Yea Chriſt as a Mediator he is ſenſible of our temptations, knoweth our need and wants, and therefore the more ready to comfort. Chriſt that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:48709:118"/>
wanted comfort himſelf; and therefore had an Angel ſent to comfort him, is thereby the more compaſſionate and willing to comfort us Thus you may read Chriſt and God put together in this very act, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 16, 17. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and God even our Father, who hath given us everlasting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, comfort your hearts. Paul</hi> here prayeth, that both Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father would comfort them. Chriſt therefore not only abſolutely as God, but relatively as Mediator, is qualified with all fitneſſe and fulneſſe to communicate conſolation; he is the fountain and head, as of grace, ſo of com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We are comforted by Chriſt <hi>Meritoriouſly;</hi> he hath merited at the <note place="margin">2. Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</note> hands of God, our comfort; for without Chriſts death and atonement, we were no more ſubjects prepared for comfort, then the damned Angels. Had all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind with <hi>Dives</hi> begged but for a drop of comfort, ſuch was the gulph between God and us, that it could not be obtained: So that by Chriſt a way is made for our conſolation: Chriſt did not only obtain the communication of the holy Ghoſt in the gifts and graces thereof. So that as by Chriſt the Spirit of God is given to the Church, as a guide to teach and lead into all truth, as the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, and uſe of all holineſſe: So he is alſo as the <hi>Comforter,</hi> who giveth every drop of conſolation, that any believer doth enjoy. Though therefore joy and comfort be in Scripture attributed to the holy Ghoſt, as the appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and applying cauſe thereof; yet this is wholly becauſe of the merits of Chriſt: And therefore we may pray for comfort upon the ſame grounds, as we doe for holineſſe; They are both the fruits of Chriſts death.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We are comforted by Chriſt <hi>Objectively,</hi> that is in him, and from him we take our comfort. As Chriſt is called <hi>Our righteouſneſſe,</hi> becauſe in <note place="margin">3. Objectively.</note> and through his righteouſneſſe we are accepted of in him, we are compleat: So Chriſt is <hi>our comfort,</hi> becauſe in him we find matter of all joy, though there be troubles and vexations from the creatures, though the Sunne and Moon be turned into bloud, all powers threaten perſecution, yet from and in Chriſt he can abundantly rejoyce. And indeed this is the wine the carnal man never drinketh of, the honey he never taſted of. The world is a ſtranger to this joy in Chriſt; They rejoyce in riches, in honours, in worldly advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but they know not what it is to rejoyce in Chriſt, as our Mediator, and treaſure of all fulneſſe. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. They are ſaid to be <hi>the circumciſion, who rejoyce in Jeſus Christ, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> As therefore in the day time we ſee the Sunne only and no Stars: Thus the people of God in their ſufferings behold Chriſt the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe; and as for the Stars of the creatures, they do not afford any light. What made the <hi>Martyrs</hi> leap for joy? Could they take any comfort from the world? No, that was an <hi>Aegypt</hi> to them, a valley of tears; ſo that it was in Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they did rejoyce. For want of the knowledge and experience of this, it is that the unſound profeſſor, will deny Chriſt, and his truth rather then ſuffer the loſſe of any thing, becauſe he feeleth more ſweetneſſe, more pleaſure, in his goods, in his pleaſures, in this world, then he can do in <note place="margin">How many wayes Chriſt makes his comforts to abound to thoſe that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for him? 1. By perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them of the goodneſs of the cauſe, why they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> Chriſt. It is the gracious heart that can thus rejoyce in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us conſider, <hi>How many wayes Chriſt doth make our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in ſufferings for his ſake to abound.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Christ doth it by aſſuring and perſwading of our hearts concerning thoſe truths and righteous actions, we do ſuffer for.</hi> If comfort ariſe from ſuffering for Chriſt, then the more aſſured we are, that we do ſuffer for him, the greater is our conſolation. If a man have great doubts in his heart, whether he ſuffers for Chriſt or not? Whether it be a truth or an errour that he is troubled for? Whether he was a buſie-body, or not?
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48709:118"/>
Whether he did keep within his calling and bounds, or not? If (I ſay) there be theſe heſitances and diſceptations in his mind, How can he have any comfort? Therefore that our comfort may be full, Chriſt giveth us the riches of aſſurance in our underſtanding; Faith becomes the evidence, and ſtrong conviction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. upon their ſouls, inſomuch that they know they are in the truth; They know it's righteouſneſſe they ſuffer for. Thus you may obſerve the Apoſtles in all the oppoſitions they met with from the world, and all the malice of Satan, yet never queſtioning or doubting, whether they were deluded or no, but were fully aſſured of thoſe things they did preach. Now this conſideration is the more to be taken notice of, becauſe the ſufferings for Chriſt, in the latter age of the Church, have differed wonderfully from the former. For in the primitive perſecutions, their ſufferings did ariſe from <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> it was for profeſſing of Chriſt, and oppoſing of Idolatry. Now theſe things were plain, here was no diſputing. But then in the after-ages of the Church, when Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks got power, eſpecially when Antichriſt was exalted, and the Papacy lifted up with all ſtrength, then thoſe that did perſecute, pretended Chriſt, that what they did, they did for the honour and glory of Chriſt; and thoſe who did ſuffer, though indeed for Chriſt, yet were reputed enemies to Chriſt: And this is that which makes ſuffering for Chriſt to be a more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing in theſe later dayes. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> that have put to death ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> defend themſelves with theſe glorious Titles, <hi>That they are onely the Church of Christ; That Christ is onely amongst them; That all who withdraw obedience from the Pope, are out of the Ark, out of hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That it is ſervice to Chriſt to root them out; and therefore the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ſuffered for, were not about the Trinity, the Incarnation of Chriſt, the Reſurrection; for which of old believers ſuffered from Pagans, but about Tranſubſtantiation, the Univerſal Juriſdiction of the Pope, the Infallibility of the Church, the worſhipping of Images, and praying to Saints:</hi> The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh party pleading for theſe, as allowed of by Chriſt; The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of them, as Idolatry, and alſo injurious to Chriſt. Now on the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſide was the whole Chriſtien world, almoſt all the learned men, all the great men, all the devout religious men, they were zealous this way; and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> they were but few comparatively, many of them private men and women. What a temptation was here to thoſe that ſuffered? How eaſily might they think, what am I wiſer than all? Is it likely God would reveal that to me, which he denieth to others more learned? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they diſpute, they bring Scripture and Fathers: May not I be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? May not the Devil <hi>transforme himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> and ſo deceive me? Truly ſuch temptations would quickly have blown down the houſe, had it been built onely upon ſand; but the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Rock, Chriſt gave them full aſſurance of thoſe truths they loſt all for; and this made way for their great comfort. This conviction then, and aſſurance of faith wrought by the Spirit of God, is that which is the root of our comfort, whereas doubtings and fears would diſquiet all. It is true, <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf, That he had many times ſuch thoughts, <hi>Tunè ſolus ſapis,</hi> Art thou onely wiſe? What if thou art damned, and draweſt others to Hell with thee? And when a grave Divine came to him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of this temptation, That of the Evangelical Doctrine, which he preached, he could not find that Faith and Aſſurance upon his ſoul he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, which was a bitter trouble to him. <hi>Luther</hi> upon the diſcloſing of this, brake out, ſaying, <hi>I think God I have met with one tempted, as I am tempted.</hi> There were it may be ſome temptations and doubts ſometimes upon the ſpirits of thoſe who did ſuffer, for there was fleſh ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48709:119"/>
in them, and the Devil was deſirous to winnow them: but yet the power of Faith, and the evidence of Divine Authority in the truths they ſuffered for, would at laſt like the Sunne break forth and diſſipate thoſe miſts. Therefore pray much for the guidance of Gods Spirit herein through the Word, that thy comfort may be ſure. The Heretick that ſuffers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath a falſe and erroneous perſwaſion; therefore he hath a falſe and a deceitfull comfort, and therefore is but like one in a dream, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf with great imaginations, when he awakeneth poor and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: but the true ſufferer, he hath joy, and he knoweth his joy is good, and upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound grounds, which never can be taken away.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt doth comfort, by informing of us aforehand of all the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. By ſorewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their ſufferings.</note> 
                  <hi>troubles and ſufferings which will neceſſarily accompany the true profeſſion of faith in his Name.</hi> Is not our Saviour often upon this ſubject? Doth he not frequently fore-tell his Diſciples, what reproach and hatred they ſhall meet with? Doth not the Scripture alſo in ſeveral places inſiſt upon this point, <hi>That all who will live godly must ſuffer many tribulations; That the Diſciple muſt not be above his Maſter.</hi> Yea, that we are appointed and ſet by God to afflictions, they are the effect of our predeſtination, as well as grace and glory is. Now in this we may be comforted, Chriſt hath done is no wrong; he hath told us what we muſt look for, it's no more then we expected, The fiery trial is not a ſtrange thing. Surely this maketh way for much comfort, that we looked for afflictions aforehand; we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an Ark againſt the deluge ſhould come. The Devil he being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver dealeth contrary to Chriſt, for he tempts with pleaſant baits hiding the hook; he ſheweth thee pleaſure and profit, but not a word of that hell and torments which will neceſſarily follow thereupon. But Chriſt tels thee of the worſt at firſt, and keepeth his beſt wine to the laſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt comforteth us, by informing of us of his Sovereignty and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. By inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us of his Sovereignty and conqueſt over the world.</note> 
                  <hi>conqueſt over the world.</hi> So that both Devils, and his Inſtruments are but Lions in his hand, and ſo he lets them looſe, and pulleth them off, as he pleaſeth. If our enemies were equal, or ſuperiour to Chriſt in power, then we might juſtly be left without comfort; but what Chriſt ſpake to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, belongs to all, <hi>I will not leave you,</hi> John 14. 18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe, Orphans,</hi> in the original: your condition is as good, as if Chriſt were here corporally upon the earth, and ſhould ſpeak to thee to be comforted. Would not this rejoyce thee in thy afflictions, if Chriſt himſelf ſhould come to thee and ſay, <hi>Be of good comfort, I am with thee, I will ſupport thee?</hi> Now Chriſt giveth his Spirit to be a Comforter in his room. That as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calleth the Spirit, <hi>Vicariam vim, (Lib. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.)</hi> in reſpect of Doctrine; ſo alſo it is in regard of comfort; and wherein can it more be manifeſted then in teaching of us, that the world is conquered by Chriſt? <hi>John 16. 33. In the world ye ſhall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</hi> Faith maketh us behold this conqueſt over principalities and powers, as alſo over all adverſaries: ſo that thou art to receive comfort, becauſe there is no argument of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; but it may be anſwered from Chriſt; and if thou art dejected, it is becauſe thou haſt low thoughts of Chriſt; Thou doeſt not judge of him, as he is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt comforteth, by vertue of his prayer put up in that very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</hi> In that ſolemn valedictory prayer of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17. 13. one end <note place="margin">4. By vertue of his prayer put up in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry behalf.</note> why he poured out that ſo affectionately before his death, was, that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers might have <hi>Chriſts joy fulfilled in themſelves.</hi> It's Chriſts joy, and their joy; Chriſts efficiently, theirs ſubjectively. So that as there is fulneſſe of grace in Chriſt to ſubdue every corruption; thus there is fulneſſe of joy in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48709:119"/>
him for every tribulation: and that this may be applied to thee, Chriſt, who cannot be denied by his Father, for he heareth him in all things, hath thus prayed to God for it. And therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by virtue not onely of his death, but alſo of his prayer and interceſſion; that thou art made to rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt comforts in ſufferings, by instructing thee of the good uſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. By inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of the ſpiritual advantages which come from ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Turn to thy own ſpiritual and eternal good.</hi> Thou ſhalt hereby be more purified from thy filth and corruption; this will winnow away thy chaff; this fire will purge out thy droſſe; this will be a School, wherein thou wilt learn more ſpiritual and divine knowledge in heavenly things, then ever before. Sufferings have taught more than vaſt libraries, or the beſt books can teach.</p>
               <p>Again, They will conduce to thy <hi>eternal Glory.</hi> God taketh up every tear in his bottle; how much more every drop of blood? For indeed by ſuffering in the work of the Lord, thou art more than <hi>Angelical;</hi> though the Angels do the will of God purely, chearfully and conſtantly, yet they meet with no troubles nor perſecutions for it, as believers do. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore if God at laſt take his <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s out of priſon, and ſets them on thrones of glory. Beſides, believers are comforted, becauſe they know all their ſufferings will turn to the advantage of the Church. Others are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and encouraged by this; what rejoycing doth this create in the heart of a believer? as we may ſhew more largely in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> Of Inſtruction to all ſuch, who take upon them the profeſſion of Chriſt, let them not be in jeſt; do not fall upon it by cuſtome and education only; but remember when thou proffereſt to follow him, that he will ask, whether thou canſt be baptized with his Baptiſm or no; he will tell thee of the troubles that follow his way; his advice is, to ſit down and conſider with thy ſelf, whether thou canſt build this houſe or no, fight this warfare or no: For it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee, never to have owned Chriſt, than by carnal fears to apoſtatize, ſaying, I did not look for theſe reproaches, theſe troubles; I thought not the way would have been ſo difficult. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 57. We have ſome come voluntarily to Chriſt, proffering to follow him whitherſoever he did go; but Chriſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not, becauſe they underſtood not how much they muſt ſuffer in his way, and therefore when they had put hand to the plough, they would look back. Oh then again and again look upon what terms you profeſſe Chriſt! If thou canſt not be a <hi>Martyr</hi> in thy ſoul, how wilt thou be in thy body? If thou canſt not leave thy ſins, thy luſts for his ſake; how canſt thou thy life?</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>WE ſhall now put a period to our diſcourſe about this text; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the laſt Obſervation to be improved, which is from the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude</hi> or <hi>proportion,</hi> that is between our <hi>ſufferings</hi> and our <hi>comforts,</hi> as the one aboundeth, ſo the other aboundeth. Should we have great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſmall comforts, this would be to put ſome few drops of honey into a fountain of gall: The bitterneſſe would ſtill abide. The Lord therefore doth commenſurate his comforts according to our afflictions; he layeth a Gyants burden upon Gyants ſhoulders, and Childrens burden upon a Child.</p>
               <p>Doct. <hi>That God doth proportion our comforts to our ſufferings.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion our comforts to our ſufferings.</note>
               </p>
               <p>If our ſufferings increaſe, our conſolations increaſe. So that if thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are greater, and more multiplyed then ever, thou haſt no cauſe to fear, for thy ſupports and cordials ſhall alſo be more increaſed. As thou art a man of ſorrows, ſo thou ſhalt be alſo a man of joys, if thou calleſt upon all that paſſe by, as the Church did, <hi>Lam. 1. 12. Behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſorrow, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me!</hi> So thou ſhalt call to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to <hi>come and ſee the wonderfull mercies which God hath vouchſafed unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to pour this oyl into the wounds of thoſe that are afflicted, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Lord Chriſt in all his diſpenſations, ſtill accommodateth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt alwaies accommodates himſelf to the capacities of his people.</note> 
                  <hi>to the capacity of his people.</hi> He regards what they can bear; like the wiſe Phyſician, doth not give the ſtrongeſt Phyſick that may be, to expell the diſeaſe, but looketh to the infirmity of his Patient. We ſee Chriſt did this in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the truths of the Goſpel; if that Sunne of righteouſneſſe had appeared at firſt in his noon-day light, weak eyes would have been offended thereat; he did not injoyn them thoſe high obſervances of faſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at firſt. To which purpoſe alſo, <hi>(Luk.</hi> 5. 27.) he uſeth that notable ſimilitude, how <hi>no man putteth new wine into old bottles, but the bottles break.</hi> There is regard to be had to the Auditours. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Gor. 3. 1. I could not ſpeak
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48709:120"/>
unto you as ſpiritual, but as carnal.</hi> And indeed, all may obſerve, that Chriſt did communicate the knowledge of divine things to the Diſciples by degrees: <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you,</hi> (Joh. 16. 12.) <hi>but you cannot bear them now.</hi> As the Nurſe cheweth her meat for the Infant, doth not give it whole to him; thus did Chriſt as a Doctor to his Auditours, ſtill accommodating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf according to the receptivity of the ſubject. In like manner, thus alſo God doth in laying afflictions upon us: He takes notice how frail thou art; if this ſuffering ſhould be brought upon thee, it would bruiſe thee to pieces; or if it lay longer on thee, it would make thee put out thy hand to wickedneſſe; and therefore he taketh it off in due time. If the fourth day would conſume thee, the third day thou ſhalt be freed from it. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh fully to this, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.</hi> Above your ſtrength, (that is) not our own natural ſtrength; for there is not the leaſt temptation, the leaſt affliction, but if left to our ſelves, we ſhould fall under it. The voice of a maid to <hi>Peter,</hi> before ever he came into any danger, made him deny Chriſt, with curſings and ſwearings. Therefore he meaneth the ſtrength which Chriſt will furniſh us with. So that the ſenſe is, as any temptation cometh, ſo your ſtrength alſo is ſupplyed. And indeed, as long as Chriſt makes us ſtand upright, ſo long the affliction cannot hurt us; but when we bow and yeild to carnal reaſonings, then we miſcarry. As a Pillar, as long as it ſtands firm and upright, will bear any weight; but when it begins to bow, or grow crooked and ſloping, then it preſently falleth. We have then here a text full of comfort; It is not every affliction, every ſuffering thou maiſt be exerciſed with, but that for which God hath furniſhed and prepared thee with ſtrength for. We have a notable expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20. 28. where under a parabolical ſimilitude of the divers waies of the Husbandman to threſh out his Corn, the leſſer grain not requiring ſuch weight as the other, is ſignified, that God maketh a difference in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; ſome are more knotty and difficult then others, and therefore they need more ſtrong Phyſick to free them from their diſeaſe. The cart wheel is not turned about upon the cummin, a rod will ſerve to beat them out: A word will do more to ſome, then a blow to others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>God in his diſpenſations, doth not only keep to an equality, but he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The mercies of God do often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow.</note> 
                  <hi>doth ſuperabound, his mercy doth overflow.</hi> The Lord alwaies giveth full heaped meaſure, overflowing: In all things Chriſt hath an overplus. There cannot be an hyperbole in his goodneſſe to us: As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>Celum &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna non patiuntur hyperbolen.</hi> So neither do the riches and grace of God in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For if firſt we confider <hi>Christ</hi> comparatively with <hi>Adam,</hi> the one is the original of condemnation, the other of juſtification. There we ſhall ſee, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not only equal to <hi>Adam,</hi> but exceedeth him, tranſcendeth him. You may read <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15. where the Apoſtle making a Divine collation between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as two heads, when he had inſtanced in <hi>Adam,</hi> how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he was to conveigh ſinne and condemnation to all; then on the contrary he inſtanceth in Chriſt, and there he makes an <hi>how much more,</hi> ſtill on Chriſts ſide: <hi>If through the offence of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God through Chriſt, hath abounded to many.</hi> And <hi>Verſ. 17. If by one death reigned upon many, much more they which receive abundance of grace, ſhall reign in life.</hi> Here you ſee, that though ſinne by <hi>Adam</hi> be very terrible and dreadfull in it ſelf, yet if compared with Chriſt, it is but as the Nations to God, like a drop, or the ſmall duſt in the ballance. Therefore Chriſt thought it not enough to remove the evil <hi>Adam</hi> brought upon us, but to do it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, with a <hi>how much more.</hi> Thus alſo, if we ſpeak of the grace of Chriſt in pardoning of ſinne, we do not meet with grace juſt equall, and no more, to remove the guilt of it, but it doth overflow. Even as the light of the Sunne, is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48709:121"/>
not only enough to inlighten thy eyes, but for all the world beſides. <hi>Rom. 5. 20. Where ſinne abounded, grace hath much more abounded.</hi> Hence the Prophet compareth Gods mercy in pardon of ſinne, to the Heavens comparatively with the earth, which is but as a <hi>punctum</hi> to it; thus are all our ſinnes to the grace of God. So likewiſe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, is not a garment too narrow for us, or that will juſt ſerve to cover our nakedneſſe, and no more; but it is an infinite righteouſneſſe, as it is in Chriſt, though the application of it to us, be according to our neceſſity. Thus Chriſt calleth to the Church, <hi>Cant. 5. I. to drink of his wine abundantly.</hi> Hence it's called <hi>riches of grace;</hi> and, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable riches of grace.</hi> And Chriſt ſaid, He came <hi>that his people mght have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> Thus the power of God, the favour of God, is in abundance; Heaven, and ſalvation, is in abundance. As Chriſt is our overflowing fountain in all other things, ſo in this of conſolation likewiſe. Hence ſome have received ſo much comfort from God, that they have not been able to bear it: They have ſaid, They had enough, more would even overwhelm. For there are thoſe who dyed by joy, eſpecially when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, as well as by grief.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us conſider the grounds, <hi>Why God is thus mercifull,</hi> that he not juſt only proportions his comforts to our ſufferings, but maketh them to exceed. And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. Becauſe God in all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations doth ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his own glory, not our deſert.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe God in theſe administrations, doth chiefly regard his own honour and greatneſſe, not our deſerts.</hi> Now becauſe God is a great God, therefore his mercy is great mercy; his comforts are great comforts: Though thou art not worthy to have ſuch, yet it beſeemeth Gods glory and greatneſſe to give ſuch. Wonder not then at the ſupports and comforts which Gods people may have, even in the Whales belly, where there ſeemeth to be no hope: For, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who it is that giveth them, from what fountain they flow, even the Lord Chriſt, the fountain of all fulneſſe, for his people; and then you will ſay, Our cruce is too little to receive all the oyl he could create for us. So that the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul hath this encouragement in prayer; Lord, I ask no more then a great God is able to give; though I am unworthy to receive it, yet thou art worthy to be exalted, as the great God, who can as eaſily give great comforts as little comforts. God can as eaſily give an Ocean as a drop.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It belongs to the faithfulneſſe of God in his Promiſes, to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts abound, where ſufferings.</hi> For, by what reaſon God out of his faithfulneſſe <note place="margin">2. Becauſe of Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to his Promiſes.</note> will give any ſupport at all, by the ſame reaſon he will double and treble his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations as need requireth. It is a rule among the Schooles, <hi>Sicutſe habet ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter ad ſimpliciter, ita magis ad magis, &amp; maximum ad maximum.</hi> Now then, as God hath promiſed and ingaged to ſupport under ſufferings, ſo alſo as theſe do abound, his comforts muſt abound; otherwiſe, his people would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by their temptations, which is againſt his Promiſe. For as ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat will not warm cold water, unleſſe it be made more intenſe; ſo neither will comfort ſimply, unleſſe made more and increaſed, ſerve againſt grievous afflictions. An ordinary boat would not be like the Ark, when that deluge of waters did overflow: This ſupport, this joy thou haſt now, would not ſerve, if God ſhould exerciſe thee with greater tryals. The widows food of <hi>Sarepta</hi> might have ſerved her in an ordinary way, but when the famine came, and no ſupply could be had, then her ſtock would quickly be ſpent. Therefore urge God, and ſay, Lord, if thou bringeſt me in a wilderneſſe, thou wilt provide Manna for me; by what reaſon thou giveſt me any comfort, give <note place="margin">3. Otherwiſe God in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of mercy would be exceeded by man.</note> me more now that my ſufferings are more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If God ſhould not increaſe the ſtrength and comforts of his people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the increaſe of their afflictions, then he who is the fountain of all pity and wiſdom, ſhould be exceeded by man, who is but a ciſtern receiving from this
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48709:121"/>
fountain.</hi> For ſuch is the care and compaſſion of a man to his beaſt, that he will ſay no more burdens on it, then it can bear, and when he puts it to more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he giveth it more meat to ſtrengthen it. Now ſhall man do thus to his beaſt, and not God to his Children? So the Artificer, the Refiner of gold, when he throweth his gold into the fire, he lets it be no longer then the droſſe is purged away; it ſhall not ſtay a moment longer then will ſerve for the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to excellent uſe: And ſhall not the great God of Heaven uſe ſuch wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his people, when in afflictions, which are called their fire to try them?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>If God ſhould not give proportionable comfort in ſufferings, his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Gods glorious and in his afflicting, could not be obtained.</note> 
                  <hi>end would not be obtained in bringing theſe upon us.</hi> For theſe are to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and draw out our graces; <hi>That we may be more then conquerours,</hi> Rom. 8. And, <hi>That we may</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as 1 <hi>Cor. 10. more then bear.</hi> It is not enough meerly to <hi>conquer</hi> afflictions, but we are <hi>more then conquerours:</hi> For, there is no conquerour but hath ſome loſſe, but the Children of God loſe nothing, for they are advantaged every way, both here and hereafter. So that as their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are an effect of their Predeſtination, thus alſo their ſupport and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion floweth from the ſame fountain. Shall God, as the Authour of grace, be more deficient in his works, then as he is the Authour of nature? If then, in the courſe of nature, we live, and move, and have our being; yea, every thing hath a natural delight and facility to its works of nature; ſhall not the godly in the exerciſes of grace, which are moſt put forth in the times of trouble? God will provide, that all thy ſufferings ſhall not be in vain.</p>
               <p>But you may ſay, <hi>Have the people of God in their ſufferings, alwaies ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowings</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>of comfort? Are they not many times afflicted without, and deſtitute within?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have anſwered this heretofore, informing that <hi>Job,</hi> yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> had ſufferings without, and ſufferings within: Their afflictions did abound, but their joy did not. We diſtinguiſhed and explicated that caſe, only we ſhall now give ſome Reaſons why God, at leaſt for a time, may leave a ſuffering <note place="margin">Why God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten denies comfort in trouble. 1.

               <p>Firſt, God in thy troubles, may deny thee comfort, <hi>to teach thee that they are his gift.</hi> This cooling wind bloweth when he pleaſeth. We might think, that comfort was our deſert, that God could not be juſt to leave us without it, when it is for his cauſe we are troubled; but God will let thee know, that when thou haſt ſuffered to the utmoſt, thou haſt but done thy duty; God is not behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee. And therefore, if he giveth thee theſe cordials, know, it's of his mercy; thou haſt not merited them: And when thou haſt them, receive them thankfully.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Doth God deny thee thy deſired comforts? conſider <hi>whether thy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Becauſe perhaps by our ſins we have deſerved it. 3.

                  <hi>ſinnes have not deſerved it.</hi> For although thou ſuffereſt for him, yet it may be, much unbelief, much impatience, much frowardneſſe hath riſen in thy heart; now theſe miſty foggs, will obſcure the glorious beames of his favour. God is ready with his comfort, but thou art indiſpoſed: Thy heart is like an untuned Inſtrument, and ſo there cannot be any melodious ſound.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If thou haſt no comfort, it may be God delayeth, and puts off, that ſo they may be the more welcome, when they do come.</hi> Thus God doth not anſwer prayers preſently, that when the mercy doth come, it may be the more eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Chriſt delayed to raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that when he was reſtored to life, the mercy might be acknowdged the greater. When <hi>Paul</hi> and his paſſangers for a great while had not ſeen the Sun, this made them rejoyce the more when they did behold it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Doth God deny thee comfort? it may be it is to try whether thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be pure.</hi> Whether thou wilt ſerve him, though he giveth thee no wages.

Comfort is for our refreſhment, it is to encourage us. We, like Children, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without theſe breaſts; now, if denyed theſe, though we have a ſtone for bread, yet thou wilt not give over ſuffering for Chriſt, then thou ſheweſt thy ſelf upright indeed: For we are apt to look to conſolations, more then du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to regard comfort, more then obedience. Now when thou canſt ſay, <hi>O Lord, I will not repine, I will not be weary of righteouſneſſe, or deny the Name of Chriſt, though I have no comfort at all; it is not my eaſe, ſo much as thy glory, I look at:</hi> This will greatly indear thee to God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>God may deny thee comfort, to inform thee how much thou art behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

Now as Chriſt would be tempted like us, ſo God will have us tempted like Chriſt, that we might be the more thankfull to him. Certainly, all the paines on his body, all the diſgrace and reproach he went under, was not equall to his being without comfort; yet this he indured for thee.</p>

               <p>THis Verſe is acknowledged by many Learned Expoſitors, to be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, not ſo much from the matter, for that is eaſie, as from the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical diſpoſition of the words, there being ſeveral conjectures, and divers adventures about the tranſpoſing of them. In moſt of the Latin Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, there are three members in the disjunction, whereas the Greek hath but two, after this manner: <hi>Whether we be afflicted, whether we be comforted, and whether we exhort.</hi> But according to the Greek word, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this would make a tautology; therefore, no doubt, this was inſerted in the Latin Copies, by ſome, not diligently attending to what they did. Then as for the Greek, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth tranſpoſe the words otherwiſe then we do, putting off the ſecond member of the disjunction, <hi>viz. Whether we be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. to the next Verſe, <hi>Knowing that as you are partakers of the ſufferings,</hi> &amp;c. and then reduceth all the reſt to the former part. Some alſo blame <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> for adding in the Original, <hi>(it is;) Whether we be afflicted, it is for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation:</hi> which way our Tranſlators alſo render. And indeed, the ſenſe would runne well enough without it, relating to thoſe words, <hi>Our hope of you is ſtedfaſt.</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:48709:122"/>
But this is not material, for the ſenſe is ſtill the ſame. Not therefore to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with theſe grammatical difficulties, ſeeing the ſcope and meaning of the Apoſtle is evident, which is, That whatſoever did befall him in his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office, it was for their good, and therefore they were to be ſo farre from being diſcouraged at his ſufferings, or to deſpiſe him for them, as the falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles laboured to make them do, that they ought rather to honour him, and they themſelves to be more animated in their ſufferings for Chriſt. And in this the Apoſtle doth ſo overflow with words, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> abſurdly giveth this prophane cenſure, <hi>Intempeſtivae copiae affectatio,</hi> as if he could teach the Spirit of God how to ſpeak. But no wonder at this preſumption of his, ſeeing in his Epiſtle to <hi>Barbirius,</hi> (purging himſelf from being a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> much more from holding every thing that <hi>Luther</hi> wrote,) he addeth, <hi>he would not be ſo addicted to</hi> Auſtin <hi>or</hi> Hierome; <hi>vix etiam ipſi Paulo, ſcarce even to</hi> Paul <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Whether this <hi>vix</hi> would preſerve him from blaſphemy, let others judge.</p>

                  <hi>That the afflictions and ſufferings we indure for Chriſt, do not only turn to our</hi>

                  <hi>own good, but to the good of Gods Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That they are for our own good, hath been partly ſpoken to. Yea every diſpenſation of God to thoſe that fear him, is a benefit and an advantage: For if it be a mercy, it is <hi>bonum Dei conſolantis;</hi> if an affliction, it is <hi>bonum Dei admonentis,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin.</hi> But I am now to ſpeak of the diffuſive good by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in reſpect of others.</p>
               <p>That ſufferings for Chriſt are of publique edification to the Church, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by two or three notable texts, concerning what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelf, <hi>Phil. 1. 12. I would ye ſhould underſtand, that the things which hapned to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the Goſpel. I would ye ſhould underſtand;</hi> It is a truth that Believers ſhould poſſeſſe themſelves with: For indeed, it is a ridle, that <hi>out of this ſtrong one ſhould come honey,</hi> that <hi>out of darkneſſe ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe light, from death come life.</hi> The not underſtanding of this, hath made ſo many Apoſtates, thinking that the Kingdom of Chriſt and his waies, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold, becauſe all the power of the world conſpire to oppreſſe it; but the Apoſtle would have them know, that perſecutions do not hinder, but further the Goſpel. The treading and trampling on this Camomile, makes it thrive the better. Another remarkable text, is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. where the Apoſtle having ſhewed, that though they did caſt him into bonds, yet the Word of God could not be bound; no more then a man (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerveth) that cutteth off a branch from the tree, can cut off the Sun-beams alſo from the Sun, that may ſhine upon that branch: he addeth, that <hi>he doth indure all things for the elects ſake, that they may obtain ſalvation.</hi> Oh wonderfull expreſſion! you might think <hi>Paul</hi> goeth too high, theſe words become Chriſt rather; Who can ſay this, but Chriſt? <hi>He ſuffereth for the elects ſake, that they may have ſalvation.</hi> But <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks this only as a Miniſter, not a Mediatour, as is more particularly to be urged: His ſcope is to ſhew, that it is not for any ſinnes of his own, any wickedneſſe that he hath committed, but it is for the good of the Church, that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48709:123"/>
he thus ſuffereth. So that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only propagate the Goſpel by preaching, but by ſuffering; when he cannot preach, he doth moſt preach; when his perſon is bound in chains, then the Goſpel is more enlarged: As <hi>Herod</hi> by cutting off <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> head, did in effect make <hi>John</hi>'s tongue more ſpeak, and witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The laſt inſtance is, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. which place is the more famous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe abuſed by the Papiſts, to uphold a treaſure or overplus in the ſufferings of the Saints, that they ſuffer more than they deſerve; and therefore the overplus is to be diſpenſed by Papal authority, for the relief of ſuch who want merits. And here cometh in their doctrine of Indulgences, which was the occaſion of that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wherein <hi>Luther</hi> was ſo greatly inſtrumental. For the Text it ſelf, you have <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſing his rejoycing in his ſufferings; though ſo afflicted, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, being made a ſpectacle to men and Angels, <hi>Accounted the off-ſcouring of the world, yet in all this he did rejoyce.</hi> For God loveth a cheerfull ſufferer, as well as a cheerfull giver, <hi>Si quid boni tristis feeris, per te fit, magis quam tu fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis;</hi> It is done in thee, rather than by thee, the good thou doeſt with grudging and reluctancy. Yea admire the publick affection of <hi>Paul;</hi> this was not ſo much becauſe he ſhould hereby have a greater crown of glory, that he ſhould hereby be more honoured, but principally he rejoyced, becauſe he ſuffered for others, that by his perſecutions many others may be imboldened to profeſs the Goſpel. Now he ſheweth in what manner he did ſuffer for them, <hi>viz. By filling up that which is behind of the affliction of Chriſt in his fleſh, for the bodies ſake, which is the Church.</hi> This ſeemeth ſtrange, how could <hi>Paul</hi> fill up the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the things behind</hi> of Chriſts ſufferings? Were Chriſts ſufferings imperfect? Could <hi>Paul</hi> make up that which was deficient in Chriſt? This would be to make <hi>Paul</hi> copartner with Chriſt in the work of the mediation; and then <hi>Paul</hi> might truly have ſaid, that which once by interrogation he ſo vehemently denied, <hi>Paul was crucified for them.</hi> Therefore you muſt know, the ſufferings of Chriſt are of two ſorts. <note place="margin">The ſufferings of Chriſt of two ſorts. 1. In his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 2. In his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe which he ſuffered in his own Perſon, as Mediator and head of his Church;</hi> And thus <hi>by once offering up of himſelf, he for ever made perfect thoſe that do believe in him;</hi> and thus there are no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, no remainders behind to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are the ſufferings of the members of Chriſt united to him their Head;</hi> and theſe are called <hi>his ſufferings,</hi> becauſe of that myſtical conjunction between Chriſt and his members; as alſo that ſympathy that is in him with them in their ſufferings. Now as Chriſt was appointed to ſufferings; ſo is every member of his, by way of conformity to their Head ſet apart alſo for their ſufferings; and theſe are the afflictions of Chriſt that are ſtill behind. All the members of Chriſt have not yet fully ſuffered. In every age there are ſome ſtill to be afflicted for his ſake, and as long as any one believer is to ſuffer, ſo long ſomething of Chriſts afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons remaineth ſtill behind. Therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> addeth, <hi>He was to fulfill theſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Propoſitions clearing the truth. 1. The ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Saints for the good of the Church, are ſtill to be diſtinguiſhed from Chriſts ſufferings. How Chriſtian Martyrs ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings differ. 1. His death was not only a Martyrdom, but a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>afflictions in his fleſh;</hi> and the end is, <hi>for the good of the Church.</hi> They ſuffer for the Church, but not as Chriſt ſuffereth, as will appear by ſome Propoſitions to clear the Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, when we ſay, <hi>That the afflictions of the godly, especially of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent officers in the Church, are for the good of the Church, you must ſtill distinguiſh them from the ſufferings of Chriſt for the Church alſo.</hi> The Martyrs they died to witneſs the truth, and hereby occaſionally to procure ſalvation for others; but Chriſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ng for others was in a far more tranſcendent and efficacious way. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſts death was not only a martyrdom, but a propitiation, and an atonement alſo. Chriſt</hi> (we grant) <hi>did ſuffer as a Martyr, he came into the world to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the truth.</hi> And he is ſaid 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 13. To have witneſſed a good confeſſion before Pontius Pilate.</hi> But thoſe wretched <hi>Socinians</hi> are therefore to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe they make this the only end of his death, That he died by way of <hi>example,</hi> not by way of <hi>propitiation</hi> for our ſins. Thus with them the ſufferings of Chriſt, and of <hi>Paul</hi> for the Church, differ only gradually, not in kind. Chriſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48709:123"/>
died as a more eminent Martyr than <hi>Paul,</hi> but both only by way of witneſs to the truth. Take we heed then, that we do not ſplit our ſouls at this rock of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, denying the atonement of Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They differ in the efficacy alſo.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſufferings, and ſo all the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">2. In the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.</note> of the godly do only objectively, or by way of example turn to the good of others: They comfort, convert, or ſave others only miniſterially; but Chriſts ſufferings did meritoriouſly and efficiently alſo procure all the benefits which the Church ſtandeth in need of. Hence remiſſion of ſinne, juſtification, renovation, and glorification are attributed unto his blood, which cannot be to the blood of the Martyrs. So that Chriſts death did by way of merit and cauſality procure all the priviledges the Church enjoyeth.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>All the ſufferings which any undergo for the Churches</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the Churches good are not meritorious either for our ſelves or others.</note> 
                  <hi>good, they are not meritorious or ſatisfactory, either for our ſelves or others.</hi> As the Papiſts do moſt derogatively to the honour of Chriſt maintain; for their Doctrine about the ſufferings of Martyrs for Chriſts cauſe, is very proud and phariſaical. They dogmatize that by theſe he may merit and ſatisfie God (yet through the merits of Chriſt, <hi>Tincta ſanguine Chriſti)</hi> yea not only thus ſatisfie for his own ſins, but may ſupererogate. So that they exceed the <hi>wiſe Virgins,</hi> they will part with ſome of their oil, becauſe they have more than enough. So that from the overplus of all their ſufferings the Church hath a great ſtock and treaſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe that have no merits of their own. Now this is a meer political engine in Popery, to make the Pope have indeed a great treaſury, for he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and diſpenſeth out of this ſtock for money. Inſomuch that <hi>Albertus Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaith plainly, <hi>That a rich man is in a farre better condition to be ſaved than a poor man, becauſe he hath money to buy his pardon, and to redeem himſelf, which the poor hath not.</hi> Thus theſe like <hi>Judas,</hi> make a ſale and bargain of Chriſt; but though the godly ſuffer, yet their ſufferings are not for that end as Chriſts was; even as when they obey the Law of God they do it not for that end which Chriſt did. For both in ſuffering and doing Chriſt was only meritorious, becauſe he was without ſin, and did more than he was bound to, which cannot be ſaid of any Martyr.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When we ſay, the ſufferings of the godly turn to the good of others, <note place="margin">3. That our ſufferings turn to others good is not from themſelves, but from the power and grace of God.</note> 
                  <hi>This is not to be understood, as if of themſelves they did ſo, but by the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and grace of God working by them.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> cannot of himſelf cauſe comfort and courage in others; for he acknowledgeth God only to be the fountain of all comfort; and therefore he prayeth to God, that God would do good by ſuch afflictions. And as <hi>Paul</hi> cannot of himſelf thus do good to others by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: (For it is with him, as in his preaching, <hi>He doth but plant and water, it is God that giveth the increaſe:)</hi> So neither do theſe ſufferings work good of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by any intrinſecal virtue and efficacy they have. For how many by theſe perſecutions are the rather terrified. So that as the Goſpel is, though to ſome <hi>a ſavour of life,</hi> yet to others <hi>a ſavour of death.</hi> Thus afflictions and troubles to ſome do diſcover their hypocriſie and guile, as winnowing doth the cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, but to others they are bleſſed, either to converſion, or to edification. So that in all the ſufferings of the Church, we are by prayer to importune God, that by theſe means greater glory may come to Chriſt; and that theſe waters of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be like thoſe to the Ark, which could not drown it, but exalted it <note place="margin">4. Hence we may admire the wiſdom, power and goodneſs of God, turning our enemies wicked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto our good.</note> nearer to Heaven. Hence</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>We may admire the wiſdome, power and goodneſſe of God, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the enemies of Gods Church deal craftily and cruelly, in that very thing he is above them, working the contrary to that which they are intending.</hi> For how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſecutors hath the Church had, who like <hi>Haman</hi> reſolved to root out the very name of Chriſtianity, and their perſecutions have increaſed the number of Chriſtians? Thus it muſt needs be madneſs and torment to the Churches enemies
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48709:124"/>
to ſee that the wayes they take to demoliſh, is indeed to build up the Church of God. Even as it was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he called a counſel to deal craftily with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to oppreſs and diminiſh them, then they were the more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied. Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 24. when <hi>Herod</hi> ſet himſelf to kill the eminent ſervants of the Lord, and thereby weaken the Church of God: for when the ſhepherds were diſſipated, what would become of the flock? it is ſaid, <hi>But the word of God grew and multiplied.</hi> See how the contrary fell out to <hi>Herods</hi> deſign.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, Let us conſider, <hi>What is the general good promoted by</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby the glory of God and Christ is the more exalted amongst all that fear him.</hi> For when the Churches of God ſhall ſee the wiſdome and goodneſs of God thus to his people, turning all the cruelty and craft of their adverſaries to their own good, that what they could never do, their enemies do for them: What glory and praiſe doth this cauſe in all Congregations? How is the Church indeared hereby to God, to truſt in him, to continue faithfull to him in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes? God hath been good and will be good. God hath turned the greateſt evil of men to the greateſt advantage, and he will do it. As Chriſts death is called a <hi>glorifying of him:</hi> Thus alſo are the ſufferings for Chriſt, the <hi>believers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and not only ſo, but the <hi>glory of Chriſt</hi> alſo.

So that as the ſhaking of a ripe flower maketh many ſeeds fall to the ground, and in ſtead of that one flower many come up in the room of it: or as when the Vine hath its branches cut off, there come farre more in ſtead thereof. Thus it hath alſo been by all the troubles on the Church of God, by afflictions, and by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under them. How numerous did the Church of God grow, even like the ſtars in Heaven?</p>
               <p>Let the Uſe be, To conſider thoſe examples of all ſuch worthies, who have ſuffered for Chriſt, whether recorded in Scripture, or in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, read them for thy comfort and thy ſalvation. The word of God, and the lives of Martyrs bearing witneſs to it, may much prevail over a ſtony heart. It hath been a good bleſſing of God, that the Names and Hiſtories of moſt Martyrs have been preſerved and recorded for the good of the Church of God to come. The lives and ſufferings of our Martyrs here in <hi>England,</hi> what influence may they not make upon thee? What patience, what heavenly mindedneſs, what courage ſhould this put into thee? As <hi>Abel</hi> though dead ſpeaketh: Thus do all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs, the <hi>Bradfords,</hi> the <hi>Ridleys,</hi> the <hi>Latimers,</hi> they all ſpeak ſtill; and God ſuffereth ſuch perſecutions to be as perpetual Sermons to teach us.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond particular in this Text, as it ſtands divided, is the <hi>Conſequent</hi> or <hi>Effect of this tribulation;</hi> which is ſet down in a particular and ſpecial manner above any other fruit of it, and that is two-fold, <hi>Conſolation</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> Of the word <hi>Conſolation</hi> enough hath already been ſaid. For the other, <hi>viz. Salvation,</hi> we ſhall remit it to the end of the verſe, where it is again ſpecified. So that our work is immediately to proceed to the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſufferings for Chriſt ſhould be ſo farre from diſheartning, and offending</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sufferings for Chriſt help much our comfort and ſalvation.</note> 
                  <hi>others, that a true and right conſideration of them, may much provoke our comfort and ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This truth is of great uſe. For the afflictions accompanying the wayes of Chriſt, have been an offence, and a ſtumbling block to many. Now when a curb ſhall be made a ſpur, when an hinderance, a furtherance; and we ſhall be encouraged from thoſe particulars which ſhould drive back, this conſideration muſt be very profitable.</p>
               <p>Before we come to amplifie in what manner, in what reſpects perſecutions are made thus ſerviceable to others, Let us take notice,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That the ſufferings of others do work good only occaſionally, or by way</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of others work good only occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, not effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſly.</note> 
                  <hi>of example.</hi> We muſt not conceive any merit or cauſality (as was declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) in <hi>Martyrs;</hi> They are Examples, not Mediators; Their light did ſhine that we might thereby glorifie God. So that we muſt take heed that the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the godly do not obſcure the ſufferings of Chriſt, that they ſhould not be accounted the only treaſure of Chriſt. But as <hi>Luther</hi> was afraid, leſt his books ſhould take men off from meditating on the Bible: Or as <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid men ſhould judge of him, as if he by his own power had done that miracle; and therefore told them, <hi>It was onely by the Name of Christ.</hi> So alſo it was with all the true Martyrs of Chriſt, they were humble, looking upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as unworthy of the name of a Martyr; neither would they have their blood derogate from the blood of Chriſt. Hence <note place="margin">2. Hence we may bewail the ſuperſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church about the Martyrs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We may greatly deplore and bewail the Apoſtaſie of the Church concerning thoſe that were Martyrs and ſufferers for Christ: in what ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and ſinfull devotion were they plunged in about them?</hi> So that their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were not for the ſalvation, but the deſtruction of many, through the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:48709:125"/>
ſinne and indiſcretion of after ages. It is true there is a lawfull and due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of God for his graces beſtowed on thoſe Worthies; yet they were but the pens, Gods Spirit was the ready writer; they were but the veſſels God pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that curious ointment in them. It was not they ſo much as God in and by them; for they were men like us, ſubject to carnal and worldly fears; they were reeds of themſelves ready to be ſhaken by every wind, but God eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. So that it is our duty to bleſſe God, who gave ſuch power and grace to men; yea and we are in a civil way to honour and love them, to deſire to imitate them, to make them examples for us to follow. If the Papiſts had gone no further, we and they ſhould have been at concord in this point; but from imitation they fall to adoration: And although they heap up as many diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as <hi>Samſon</hi> did men by his ſlaughter, <hi>Heap upon heap,</hi> to clear themſelves in this matter, yet it is but <hi>vitreum acumen,</hi> theſe glaſſes are quickly broken. That the name of ſuch who ſuffer for Chriſt ſhould be like a precious ointment, and an honourable eſteem of them be had alwayes in the Church, none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Therefore thoſe moral reſpects vouchſafed to them in the primitive times are not to be blamed; as the regarding of the judgement of a Martyr, as much or more than any Biſhop or Doctor. As alſo when any had fallen by infirmity in times of perſecution; ſuch repenting did firſt go to the Confeſſours in priſons that were <hi>Candidates,</hi> or deſigned <hi>Martyrs,</hi> intreating their favour, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring liberty of admiſſion into Church-communion from them, which the Church received, they making publick ſatisfaction in reſpect of ſcandal by ſerious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; but this afterwards began to be greatly abuſed, and <hi>Cyprian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of it; therefore it was at laſt juſtly abrogated, howſoever ſuch reſpects as were meerly moral, are to be allowed; but for religious conſiderations to do any thing to them that is unjuſtifiable. A learned man thinketh, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy ſpoken of by <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1. which tels of an <hi>Apoſtaſie, bringing in Doctrines of daimons,</hi> as he explains it, is the worſhipping of theſe Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; and that this was the great Apoſtaſie of the Church. Whether that be the intent of the holy Ghoſt, is not here to be diſputed. Certainly there was great Apoſtaſie in the Church from primitive ſimplicity, when they began to worſhip ſuch who had been Martyrs; yea their reliques they would in a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner preſerve and adore praying alſo unto them, and expecting both ſoul-mercies and body-mercies from them. Here this wine did begin to turn into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and contrary to Chriſt, they turned wine into water; that which was only for example and imitation, they turned to Adoration and worſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did not only derogate from the glory due to Chriſt; but even thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and glorious Martyrs themſelves, were they corporally preſent, would with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> rend their cloaths, and refuſe ſuch worſhip. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Angel did forbid <hi>John</hi> from worſhipping him, ſaying, <hi>He was his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervant, and therefore he muſt worſhip God:</hi> How much more would the Martyrs, who were ſubject to like paſſions as we are. Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the godly are afflicted and perſecuted for our comfort and ſalvation, yet take heed of ſuperſtitious exceſſe about them, turning imitation into religious adoration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe that ſuffer may be very uſefull to encourage us, but then we muſt be ſure they be ſuch, who do indeed ſuffer for Christ.</hi> For no doubt all <note place="margin">3. The ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Chriſt may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us, but we are to be ſure they are indeed the ſufferers for Chriſt.</note> thoſe who have ſuffered in any falſe way, The Heretick for his hereſies, the Papiſt for his Idolatry and ſuperſtition, have greatly confirmed thoſe that were of that perſwaſion. They did greatly comfort and animate others that did believe them to be the true Martyrs of Chriſt. So that we may ſay of ſuch, contrary to that in the Text, <hi>They are afflicted for the destruction and damnation of others.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are hardened in their Idolatries and Hereſies by their ſufferings. Look we then, that we do propound right paterns to our ſelves, that we be not deceived,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48709:125"/>
as ſometimes in Popery they have worſhipped the bone of an Aſſe or an horſe for a Saints relique; for the Devil hath his <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Hereſie hath her <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;</hi> yea vain-glory hath had many <hi>Martyrs.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man who dieth for the truth, yet to have no other motive but vain-glory.</hi> The Apoſtle affirmeth it alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. when he ſuppoſeth a man may <hi>give his body to be burnt,</hi> and yet <hi>for want of charity</hi> be a <hi>tinkling cymbal, or it will profit him nothing.</hi> This is ſo ſecret a ſinne, and we are ſo prone to it, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> did charge it upon all the Chriſtians (though falſly and maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that they ſuffered only for vain-glory; being the more induced to think ſo, becauſe the Chriſtians did in ſuch an exceſſive manner give honour and praiſe to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, let us conſider how the afflictions of others for Chriſts <note place="margin">How the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for Chriſt work our comfort and ſalvation. 1. Hereby we ſhall have greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of theſe divine truths for which they ſuffer.</note> cauſe work to our comfort and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We ſhall have the greater aſſurance and perſwaſion of thoſe Divine Truths upon our ſouls, that they are not the meer inventions of men, or delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our own ſouls.</hi> For how can it but greatly aſſure us, that if this were not the truth of God, they could never have that comfort, that courage, that evidence and demonſtration upon their hearts: the preſence of God with them in thoſe exquiſite ſufferings, do demonſtrate, that the truths are of God, as well as the power and comforts to be of him. It is true indeed the meer ſuffering, and that with ſome joy, the moſt exquiſite torments. For a religious opinion doth not preſently argue, that it is a divine truth, that it hath Gods ſuperſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption upon it. For many heretical and deluded ſpirits have demonſtrated much confidence and comfort: yet on the other ſide, there cannot be an external great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſign of our love to the truth, and that it is of God, then by patient ſuffering for it. And therefore though Hereticks die, though Papiſts die for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as well as the true <hi>Martyr,</hi> yet the frame of their ſpirits and concomitant diſpoſitions are greatly different. For as their minds are corrupted with error, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo are their hearts and affections unſanctified, and therefore diſcover not the ſweet and gracious workings of Gods Spirit upon them, as the true ſufferer doth. So that it was not meerly ſuffering; it was not meerly torments, but the patience, faith and heavenly mindedneſſe, their love even to their very enemies, that did draw out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to love them. So that when we ſee others can be impriſoned, executed for ſuch Doctrines, and they be full of an heavenly, mortified, gracious heart at that time; this muſt needs work in us a greater aſſurance of the truth, eſpecially this doth confirm the more, when we ſee it is not one or two, but multitudes, yea millions, which have given teſtimony to ſuch truths and that by their bloud, that ſo many ſhould thus be willingly undone for that which is a falſhood, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improbable. And therefore our Divines do uſually bring the conſtancy of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> as an argument to prove the divine truths of the Scriptures. Oh then ſhalt thou doubt? Shalt thou queſtion, whether this or that be truth, when thou haſt ſuch preſidents of ſo many laying down their lives to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>From the ſufferings of others for Christ and his way, we may be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Hence we may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to truſt in God, and depend upon him, to enable us alſo, if he ſhould call us thereunto.</note> 
                  <hi>greatly encouraged to truſt in God, and to depend on him, to enable us alſo,</hi> if he ſhould call us thereunto. How apt are the people of God to be deſpondent within themſelves, to be afraid of their own weakneſſe and hypocriſie, ſaying, their hearts are ſo carnal, ſo unmortified that they know not to part with any thing, much leſſe life it ſelf for Chriſt? He cannot, will one ſay, he dare not ſay with <hi>Peter, Though all men forſake Chriſt, yet he would not;</hi> but rather if there be any that will deny Chriſt, he ſhould be the man. This temptation is very incident to the gracious heart. But if they look off from themſelves to theſe champions before their eyes, what hope and confidence may they attain unto in the Lord? For what were thoſe confeſſors of themſelves? Were they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48709:126"/>
not men? Were they not fleſh and blood as well as thou art? Were they not affected with wives, children, and life it ſelf? Were they marble and rocks? No ſurely, but they were ſubject to all ſuch temptations as thou art, and yet God was with them, he raiſed them up above their own ſtrength. So that while thou art out of this fight, thou canſt not conceive what ſtrength, and what gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influence God will vouchſafe unto thee. As we read of one <hi>French Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> in <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Martyrologie,</hi> that was exceedingly poſſeſſed with fear about ſuffering, inſomuch that he diſguiſed himſelf, and took upon him to be a ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, carrying ware up and down; but being at laſt diſcovered, and hiding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a buſh, no ſooner was he apprehended, but as he acknowledged after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as ſoon as ever the enemy had laid hold on him, that ſpirit of fear and cowardlineſſe left him, being filled with undaunted courage. If therefore we read the lives and deaths of thoſe who have been perſecuted for Chriſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what wonderfull ſupports they have had, and how God hath glorified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in their infirmities: ſo that with <hi>Paul</hi> they could ſay, <hi>I could do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> they did partake of a kind of Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And at another time he ſaith, <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> This may make thee, though a Lamb for meekneſſe and innocency, yet a Lion for courage and ſpiritual fortitude. Hence the Apoſtle, when <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in the great atchievements, many worthies had accompliſhed by faith, at the twelfth Chapter he beginneth, <hi>Seeing we are compaſſed about with ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, or Martyrs,</hi> for ſo we may render it, <hi>Let us runne the race that is ſet before us.</hi> We have ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, that as the cloud did direct and guide the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe; ſo alſo ſhould the lives and examples of ſo many (called for that end likewiſe a <hi>cloud)</hi> guide us and teach us. Who then can be diffident, unbelieving, fearfull, when he hath ſuch encouragements before his eyes?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the conſideration of ſuch worthies ſuffering for Chriſt, we may alſo take occaſion to rejoyce, and to be glad.</hi> So farre ſhould we be from ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">3. Hereby we may take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God, as enabling them, and as having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do ſo to us.</note> and apoſtatizing from Chriſt, there are ſeveral cauſes of rejoycing; partly in <hi>God,</hi> bleſſing and praiſing him, who doth ſo much exalt himſelf in weak veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. As God hath alwayes delighted to bring about the greateſt glory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by abject and contemptible means. Thus alſo he doth by the ſufferings of his people; that which is moſt unlikely, by that he magnifieth himſelf: and that God is ſeen, and made great in the world, this ſhould mightily rejoyce us, partly, <hi>Becauſe we have the ſame God, and the ſame promiſe that they had.</hi> And therefore wee may look to rejoyce as well as they. They have not a more mercifull or powerfull God than thou haſt; neither have they more excellent or better promiſes than thou haſt. So that as fire kindleth fire, thus their joy may produce joy in thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>From the ſufferings for Chriſts ſake we may informe our ſelves</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Hence we may inform our ſelves they were in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and real for Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>much in this great leſſon, that they were in earneſt, and real for him.</hi> It was not only words, or a profeſſion, but a lively ſubmiſſion unto the wayes of Chriſt. That which the Scripture complaineth of ſo much, is the general ſinne of the Chriſtian world, <hi>They follow Chriſt, becauſe of loaves:</hi> They profeſſe him while the ſcorching heat of the Sunne doth not ariſe; but when once Chriſt and their earthly comforts cannot ſtand together, then they diſcover their unſoundneſſe, and that they had no root at all. But thoſe that ſuffer for Chriſt, they profeſſe no more with their tongues then they manifeſt in their lives, <hi>Non loquimur mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, ſed vivimus,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian, We do not ſo much ſpeak great things, as live them.</hi> This was the great Objection to <hi>Seneca,</hi> and ſuch moral Philoſophers, that they had expreſſions about Virtue, but in their practice were farre from it. <hi>Seneca</hi> was forced to purge himſelf in this accuſation. But neither he, nor <hi>Socrates,</hi> nor <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor any of thoſe Maſters in Morality, could acquit themſelves.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:48709:126"/>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> that maketh <hi>Temperance</hi> a vertue, and that he only is temperate who doth it for virtues ſake, that a virtuous man will rather die than do an evil or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoneſt action, yet he kept a whore, yea and ſacrificed to her, as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did to a goddeſſe. He was moved to ſtudy Philoſophy by the inſtinct of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> which is no more than by the command of the Devil. He was ungratefull, betrayed his Countrey, and then afterwards had a great hand in poiſoning <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> which made <hi>Caracalla</hi> the Emperour, expell all Philoſophers of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi> Sect, becauſe of his miſchief to <hi>Alexander.</hi> He was alſo exceeding co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous; for this end <hi>Lucian</hi> bringeth <hi>Alexander</hi> in hell upbraiding <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that therefore he made riches part of the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> that under that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text he might the rather heap up wealth; inſomuch that <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaid truly of him, <hi>Ariſtoteles nee Deum coluit, nec curavit.</hi> So that theſe great Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts were like ſome Painters, who can draw excellent and beautifull pictures, when they themſelves are foul and deformed. So that to adde action and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our profeſſion, when we are called to it, this is to ſhew we are Chriſtians indeed, <hi>Nunc incipio eſſe Chriſtianus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when he was going to his Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>By thoſe that ſuffer we may learn to crucifie our hearts to the world,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Hence we may learn to mortifie our hearts to the world.</note> 
                  <hi>to be weaned from all comforts, not to love them more than Chriſt.</hi> Oh ſay, I find my heart ſo inordinate, ſo glewed to theſe dear relations I have; I find them ſo cleaving to my heart, that much prayer, faith and meditation cannot caſt them out. What a ſhame is this? I look upon the Martyrs, I ſee wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, eſtates, goods were nothing; Chriſt was all, Heaven was all: Oh how unworthy am I to be compared with ſuch glorious ſervants of Chriſt! I have not the Martyrdom of the heart, and how then can I endure that of the body?</p>

                  </gap>, actively, as 2 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 13.

                  </gap>, <hi>It effectually worketh in them that believe.</hi> So alſo the word is uſed actively 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4. 12. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5.

Certainly <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> aggravateth the paſſive ſignification; he did not ſay (ſaith he) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; yet the active ſenſe, if it be retained, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſame purpoſe with the paſſive. For the Apoſtle contends, that by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for Chriſts ſake, our ſalvation is advanced: Salvation puts forth it ſelf, and thereby is more exalted by theſe ſufferings, which certainly muſt be of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable comfort, to think that by theſe I am the more prepared for Heaven, and my glory will the more increaſe. Only you muſt remember alwayes, that theſe ſufferings have no cauſality or meritoriouſneſſe in them; it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gift and grace of God, hereby to increaſe our bleſſedneſſe; for after all our ſufferings, we are unprofitable ſervants, and might be thrown into hell. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſalvation of believers is promoted and advanced by their ſufferings</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſalvation of believers is promoted by their ſufferings for Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>for Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let none with <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Cyrenean</hi> be compelled to bear Chriſts croſſe; let them not grudge and repine, thinking they ſuffer more than Chriſt will ever make them amends for, that they are loſers by him; for no leſſe than eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation is exalted hereby; thou haſt gold and precious ſtones for parting with this earth. The Text I promiſed to confirm this truth, and is a parallel with mine, is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. where the Apoſtle ſheweth the unſpeakable benefit that we have by our afflictions for God, <hi>Our light affliction, which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, worketh for us a farre more, and eternal weight of glory.</hi> It is but <hi>a light affliction; light</hi> in compariſon of hell torments. Are thy ſufferings like to the ſufferings of the damned in hell? yet thou haſt deſerved them. And then <hi>light</hi> in compariſon of the <hi>weight of glory.</hi> There is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48709:127"/>
that everlaſting bleſſedneſſe, and thy afflictions: If thou ſhouldſt for millions of years endure ſuch torments as the <hi>Martyrs</hi> did, yet that was not equivalent to one hours being in Heaven. Again, he ſaith, <hi>It is but for a moment.]</hi> All thy afflictions are not eternal afflictions: Thou ſhalt not for ever and ever be thus in a ſuffering condition, compare it with eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>It is but a moment.</hi> Now theſe afflictions thus diminiſhed by him, do yet <hi>work for us an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Oh the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, not the merit of man, that bleſſeth ſuch contemptible things with an everlaſting reward! It is true, the <hi>Papists</hi> do moſt arrogantly from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> inferre, that afflictions have a cauſal and meritorious influence upon our ſalvation; that we are to abhorre ſuch thoughts, as that we ſhould have Heaven, <hi>Per modum eleemoſynae,</hi> but <hi>coronae, Not by way of alms, but by way of a crown for our ſtriving and conquering.</hi> But let men preſumptuouſly diſpute this in their Books; when they are to give up an account to God, and to ſtand before his barre, they will then plead mercy, and not juſtice; but the Word doth not ſignifie cauſality: onely that order God hath appointed, that by theſe ſufferings we ſhall come to glory. And indeed to inter any cauſality or merit from that Word, would be plainly to derogate from the Apoſtles intention, which is to ſhew the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion that is between theſe light afflictions, and that eternal glory, there is no equality between them; whereas if they had a meritorious cauſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there muſt be a condign proportion between them.</p>
               <p>But let us purſue this comfortable Doctrine. Only <note place="margin">How ſufferings advance our ſalvation. 1. They help to make us mourn for ſin, and turn to God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Lay this as a foundation, that when we ſay, <hi>Our ſalvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by afflictions,</hi> you muſt not underſtand this, as if they of themſelves did it; but it is ſolely by the power and grace of God. For in many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, and ſuch who had not deep rooting, ſufferings did not promote their ſalvation, but their damnation: Even as to herbs not well rooted, the heat of the Sun doth wither them: So that ſome men falling into afflictions, are like noiſome herbs thrown into the fire, which make the more unſavoury ſmell; like earthen veſſels, that break in the fire. They never diſcover their rottenneſſe, their love to the world, their unbelief ſo much, as in thoſe times. It is true, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 5. 3. That tribulation work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth patience:</hi> But that is not to be underſtood of it ſelf, for in many it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth impatience and unbelief; but by the power of God moving in theſe waters; there doth come healing. So that the preſence of God, and his aſſiſtance is that alone which can turn theſe ſtones into bread. Hence alſo afflictions do not advance our ſalvation, as the Word preached doth; for that alone is properly the inſtrumental cauſe in Gods hand, both for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and glorification; as afflictions are onely <hi>occaſional,</hi> and ſet home by the Word. It is true, the Word it ſelf doth not convert or ſave, by any inherent virtue, as the fire burneth, but by the co-operation of God with it; yet afflictions have not that efficacy, or reſpect in the ſame way, as the Word hath. By ſufferings then we are as the ſtone by its hewing and ſawing, prepared for that everlaſting building in Heaven; but it is the grace and power of God that doth poliſh and ſmooth us, otherwiſe through tribulations we ſhould enter even into the kingdom of hell.</p>
               <p>But let us examine, <hi>Wherein theſe heavenly ſufferings do thus carry on our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>They are a ſpecial means to humble us, to bring us low in our own eyes, to repent of all the evil we have done, and to turn unto God.</hi> As mad men are caſt into priſon, kept in the dark, and under all hardſhip, to bring them to their mind again: Thus doth God with thoſe that are his. So that it is an effect of his love to bring us into tribulations. It is his love,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48709:128"/>
that maketh him to chaſtiſe us, <hi>Heb. 12. O beatum cui Deus dignatur iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci.</hi> (Tertul. <hi>lib. de patientiâ.) O bleſſed is he to whom the Lord vouchſafeth to be angry!</hi> And this is true, not onely in afflictions meerly for ſins, but alſo in our ſufferings for Chriſt. For though the motive be thy faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in owning of Chriſt and his way, though it be not for thy ſinnes principally, but thy graces, that thou art thus exerciſed, yet God hath ſome reſpect to thy ſinnes alſo. Therefore ſuch tribulations they are of a mixed conſideration, thy gracious love to Chriſt provoketh the adverſary, yet thy ſinnes alſo God looketh at in this fiery tryal to purge them away. Hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4: 16, 17. the Apoſtle encouraging believers to ſuffer as Chriſtians, and that by many arguments, he bringeth one amongſt the reſt, that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to their ſinnes, <hi>For judgement muſt begin at the houſe of God.</hi> Theſe perſecutions he calls them judgements, and that in reſpect of the godly, which denoteth, That although God did honour them, as ſuffering for his truth, yet he did alſo judge them in thoſe ſufferings for their ſinnes. It is then the duty of all Champions and ſufferers for Chriſt, as to rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are accounted worthy to ſuffer for him: So alſo by thoſe tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to humble themſelves, to condemn and judge every ſinne that they can diſcover. It is a falſe and ſinfull opinion of ſome, mentioned by <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardus (Lib. de Martyrio.)</hi> that affirmed, <hi>Whoſoever did ſuffer for the faith of Christ, his very Martyrdome was enough to cleanſe him; ſo that he was not bound in, or before his ſufferings to repent for ſuch ſinnes, as his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might re-mind him of.</hi> No, were it poſſible for a man to give his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be burnt for the truth, and yet not to mourn for, and bewail the ſinnes he was guilty of, ſuch Martyrdome would not profit him. So that as God commands the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they went to warre, that they ſhould cleanſe the Camp of unclean things: Thus alſo all thoſe who ſuffer for Chriſt, and in ſome ſenſe may be ſaid to fight the battels of the Lord, it is their duty to arraigne themſelves for their ſinnes, and to pray, That this waſhing of them, may take away their ſpots and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe afflictions for Chriſt, do much promote our ſalvation, <note place="margin">2. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us more of God, and Chriſt, of his grace and power then we knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe they are a School to every believer, whereby to know more of God and Chriſt, of his grace and power then ever they did before.</hi> Theſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings lead us into much experimental knowledge of God, and his wayes Theſe ſee the wonders of God in the depths. A man not afflicted know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what the experiences are that uſually the godly find in ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. Hence as <hi>David</hi> acknowledged, <hi>Pſal. 119. Before he was afflicted, he went astray.</hi> Thoſe afflictions did him more good than his mercies. Thus alſo the godly, who as <hi>Joh,</hi> come like gold out of the fire, they can truly ſay, They would not be without thoſe teachings, thoſe experiences they have had, not for all the world: eſpecially, this they are experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to obſerve, <hi>How the power of God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>was perfect in his infirmities;</hi> that the more his troubles did grow, the more were the ſupports and comforts of God: Inſomuch that the afflicted ſoul wondereth, and is amazed to ſee and feel the preſence and power of God with it: It hath that comfort, that courage, which it thought had been impoſſible for him ever to enjoy. For (as formerly you heard) as afflictions abound, ſo alſo do conſolations and ſupports. So that you muſt not expect God ſhould give ſuch extraordinary diſcoveries of himſelf, but in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſes: As we read of a notable inſtance of a woman Martyr in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Heatheniſh perſecutions, who being great with child, was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the day before ſhe was to ſuffer, and in her travail ſending forth great and grievous groans: The Jailor reproved her, ſaying, That if ſhe did
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48709:128"/>
thus cry out about the bringing forth of a child, how would ſhe be able to ſuffer a cruel and tormenting death? To whom ſhe well replied, <hi>That her preſent exerciſe was natural and ordinary, and therefore expected but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſupply in that caſe, whereas her Martyrdome was extraordinary, and therefore looked for extraordinary help and comfort from God.</hi> This is to ſhew, That the diſcoveries we have in our exerciſes and troubles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the unuſual preſence, and conſolations of God, make us to ſay with <hi>Job, They had heard of God with the ear, but now they ſee him with the eye.</hi> They did but know in a riddle, now they do (as it were) face to face.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe afflictions do promote and quicken to more grace, and more</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Theſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctſons quicken us to more grace.</note> 
                  <hi>grace will have more glory.</hi> In theſe trials and heavenly conflicts, their faith, their patience, their crucified affections to the world are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced. As Grapes in the wine-preſſe ſend forth juice and ſweetneſſe: As fragrant Herbes in the fire, ſend forth a ſweeter ſmell: The Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe needeth fire to make it more refreſhing: In the race a man puts forth his ſwiftneſſe: In the fight, fortitude and valour is more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted: Natural exerciſe increaſeth the health of the body: So alſo doth ſpiritual, the health and graces of the ſoul. Seeing then that theſe afflictions heat thy ſoul ſeven times hotter than they were before, ſeeing they make thy five to gain ten: No wonder if our ſalvation be exalted by them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Our ſalvation is advanced by theſe ſufferings, <hi>Becauſe of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Becauſe of the glorious promiſes which are made to ſuch.</note> 
                  <hi>glorious promiſes which are made to ſuch.</hi> Some indeed have doubted, Whether there be Degrees of Glory or no in Heaven? But that may be fully proved, that thoſe Starres in Heaven doe differ from one another in Glory. And certainly, thoſe that ſuffer more, ſhall have greater Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Inſomuch that ſome learned men have concluded from <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 4, 5. That the <hi>Martyrs</hi> onely ſhall have a peculiar Glory beſtowed on them to reign with Chriſt a thouſand yeares here on Earth. But that being not ſo clear, we may firmly conclude, That if a drop of cold water be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Chriſts ſake, will be ſo greatly rewarded, How much more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny drops of their owne warme blood? Doe not then repine under tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral loſſes for Chriſt; it is abundantly made up ſpiritually here, and will be eternally hereafter.</p>

And yet further, a good cauſe is not enough; there muſt be an humble, patient and meek deportment in thoſe that do ſuffer. For if they ſuffer with grudging and repining, thinking God is a ſevere Maſter, who impoſeth ſuch hard tasks upon them, then they loſe their reward; neither is ſalvation advanced hereby. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is tranſlated ſometimes <hi>tolerantia, enduring;</hi> and thus in the Text: Even as the Verb <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is ſometimes <hi>Matth. 10. 22. Heb.</hi> 12. 3. But for the moſt part it is rendred <hi>patientia, patience.</hi> Thus <hi>Luk. 21. 19. Rom.</hi> 5. 3.

                  </gap>, <hi>with patience,</hi> we render it, or rather with <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance and conſtancy, that we faint not,</hi> or be weary, ere we come to the end of our race.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>

               <p>Without <hi>patience</hi> our corruptions, and our damnation is furthered by all the tribulations we groan under. So that <hi>patience</hi> is like the ſalt to ſeaſon this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that it may be acceptable. If we ſtruggle and ſtrive againſt God, complain plain and murmur, becauſe we meet with ſuch hardſhip, this depriveth us of our glory. We are not to be like the Sacrifice, that did ſtruggle and ſtrive, and therefore muſt be bound to the Altar; <hi>but we are to deny ourſelves, to take up the croſſe</hi> (which argueth voluntarineſs and readineſs) <hi>and then we muſt follow him.</hi> Holy obedience muſt accompany this bearing of the croſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 23. yea it is added, <hi>He muſt take it up daily;</hi> implying, that though this croſſe be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſhoulders every day; though it be from week to week, from year to year,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48709:129"/>
thou muſt not repine, but take it up daily. You muſt not carry the croſs of Chriſt, as the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> heifers did the Ark, lowing as they went for their young ones; where <hi>patience</hi> is, there is alſo a quiet, meek and ready reſignation of our ſelves, even as was in Chriſt, <hi>Behold I come to do thy will, O God;</hi> which will of God was partly to ſuffer moſt dreadfull things to fleſh and blood. Contranitency then and contrapugnancy to the will of God, bringing tribulations upon us, doth deprive us of all that ſoul-ſaving benefit we might have by them. It is true indeed, there is a conditional will in every ſufferer for Chriſt, ariſing neceſſarily from nature within us, which deſireth to preſerve it ſelf; and by this we would deprecate that cup which God is giving us to drink. Even Chriſt himſelf in this conditional manner prayed, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe away from me;</hi> but then with their abſolute will, they do ſubmit and ſay, <hi>Not our will, but the will of God be done.</hi> Thus we have a notable expreſſion, <hi>John</hi> 21. 18. where Chriſt ſpeaking of the death and martyrdom <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſuffer for his name, he ſaith, <hi>Another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldſt not;</hi> not that <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffered againſt his will abſolutely, not that he repined at it, but rather rejoyced in it, only it was againſt his conditional will; nature of itſelf would have deſired rather freedom from thoſe torments.</p>
               <p>But let us proceed to enquire into the Nature or Properties of this <hi>Patience;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Humane Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers agreed in the commending of patience.</note> and I ſhall not enlarge my ſelf on this ſubject in this place, becauſe it will come in more expreſly and explicitely ſome where elſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore take we notice, <hi>That although humane Philoſophers by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sects did greatly oppoſe one another, yet they did agree in the commending of patience.</hi> Indeed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth not reckon <hi>patience</hi> nor <hi>humility</hi> amongſt the moral virtues; but the <hi>Stoicks</hi> eſpecially, they did ſo commend <hi>patience,</hi> as that thereby they would have a man turned into a meer ſtone (as it were) and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural dedolency; but no <hi>Philoſophical patience,</hi> not that of <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> (who cried out ſo ſtoutly to the Tyrant, who cauſed him to be brayed and pounced to death, <hi>Tunde, tunde Anaxarchum non tundis.)</hi> or of others ſo greatly applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by humane Writers, is worthy of the name of Chriſtian patience. There is a vaſt difference in the principles, in the end, in the effects, in the concomitants, as might be ſhewed; but I ſhall not dilate at this time. This particular is brought in, to make us examine, What is the grace of patience, and what may be <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> or <hi>Moral Patience. Natural Patience</hi> I call that, which cometh much from the conſtitution and complexion of their bodies, they are more mild, quiet and enduring of grief than others. <hi>Moral patience</hi> I call that, when men by wiſdom and reading of moral precepts can harden themſelves heroically to bear the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations up on them; but <hi>Chriſtian patience</hi> is that which comes from a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſanctified nature, eying Gods glory, his will and command only, not regarding other ſiniſter reſpects. So that a <hi>Natural Patience, a Moral Patience</hi> under thy ſufferings, will not advance thy ſalvation, but that which is Chriſtian. You have a notable place for this 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 6. To patience, godlineſſe.</hi> The Apoſtle doth there exhort to have the chain of graces linked together, not to think it enough to have one grace, unleſs he have all. And therefore <hi>patience</hi> muſt be added to <hi>temperance;</hi> for that requireth the denial of our pleaſures, the crucifying of our delights, which cannot be without patience: but then to this <hi>patience</hi> we muſt adde <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> implying, that though we be never ſo meek, ſo ſtill, ſo Lamb-like under our troubles; yet if godlineſs be not added to this patient deportment, if it be not from divine principles, and to divine ends, then our patience is greatly defective. Look we therefore that when we quietly and patiently ſuffer, it came from the grace of patience, not from a counterfeit patience, for this is not true gold, and ſo will not enrich us.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction being premiſed, whereby a Chriſtian may be inabled to know when it is Nature, and when it is Grace that doth bear; when fleſh and blood
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48709:130"/>
doth ſuffer, and when a divine Nature within him. In the next place, let us conſider, What goeth to the producing of this grace of patience; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of our ſelves perform this duty of patience no more than a wilderneſſe can bringforth roſes. Therefore</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The efficient cauſe of patience is God only.</hi> The heart of man under any <note place="margin">What goeth to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 1. The efficient cauſe is God.</note> afflictions is like a wild bull in a net, there is nothing but raging and repining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every exerciſe, till God give a patient ſpirit. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 5. he is called, <hi>The God of patience:</hi> For what a wild unruly bedlam is an unſanctified man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any preſſure upon him: Like <hi>Cain</hi> he crieth out, <hi>It is greater than he can bear.</hi> Like <hi>Jobs</hi> wife, he is tempted <hi>to curſe God, and ſo die.</hi> Doeſt thou therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy trials, want patience? Doth it grieve and ſadly afflict thee, to ſee thy ſelf ſo paſſionate, ſo impaſſionate? Then let this make thee to run to the throne of grace, improve this title, <hi>God is the God of patience:</hi> Say, Oh God, it is but ſpeaking the word, it is but ſaying, Let there be patience, and there will be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience! How often have I reſolved for patience? How often prayed for patience, and yet Lord my heart is tormented and toſſed up and down, like that Lunatick, which could not be bound by any chains? Not only my tongue, but my heart are worſe than unruly and ſavage beaſts they may be tamed; but this, no man, only God can tame it. It's God only therefore that maketh in us patience: The grace of <hi>patience</hi> is farre above our power. <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote a Book of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but in the very beginning he apologizeth for himſelf, why he ſhould write of that ſubject, which he had ſo little experimentally and practically attained unto, and he excuſeth it thus, <hi>That he doth as thoſe who are ſick, they delight to be talking and praiſing of health: So I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who am Aeger caloribus impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientiae, ſick with feavoriſh impatient heats, do delight to write of patience.</hi> Thus do thou, ſeeing it is more then of thy ſelf thou art able to do. The leaſt tryal, the leaſt affliction, is ready to heat thee with impatience; pray to God importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, let him not alone, till he bleſſe thee with this compoſed patient ſpirit. Say with the ſame <hi>Tertullian, Pereat ſeculum dummodo patientiam lucrifaciam,</hi> Let the whole world periſh, ſo that God will give me patience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As God is the efficient cauſe, ſo <hi>the word of God that is inſtrumental.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The word of God is the inſtrumental cauſe.</note> The Word is like <hi>Davids</hi> harp to drive out this evil ſpirit. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 15. 14. That we through patience of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> When thy impatient fleſh doth ſuggeſt this, and that argument to diſcontent and repining, Oh remember what the word of God ſaith! It is for want of Scripture-conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of Scripture-arguments that thy heart is ſo clamorous and unruly; ſuch a command, ſuch a promiſe would preſently have made all calm and quiet. The <hi>Heathen</hi> adviſeth an angry furious man to look in the glaſſe, while he is in thoſe paſſionate fits, that he may ſee how deformed he is made thereby; but how much rather, when thy heart hath boiled over with impatient repining thoughts, art thou to recover thy ſelf immediately, and to look into the Word? See what that faith, what that requireth, and then thou wilt be aſhamed, and abhorring thy ſelf as a very beaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Afflictions themſelves according to Scripture-expreſſion, they work pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience alſo.</hi> Thus <hi>Rom. 5. 3. Tribulation worketh patience.</hi> Jam. 1. 3. <hi>The trying</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Afflictions they alſo work patience.</note> 
                  <hi>of your faith worketh patience.</hi> Here you ſee afflictions are ſaid to work patience, but not of themſelves, it's the power of God in and through them; only as the beaſt accuſtomed to the yoke is more tame than at firſt; ſo when we are conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed with afflictions that they ſeem to be no new thing, then through Gods grace, we come to be more ready and willing in a patient enduring of them. It is ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>He learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered, Heb.</hi> 5. 8. not that he could grow properly in grace, or be more obedient than he had been formerly; but it is ſpoken in regard of experimental obedience, he had the ſenſe and feeling of it more than before: but the adopted ſons of God,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48709:130"/>
they do increaſe in obedience and patience by the things that they ſuffer. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou who haſt more afflictions than others, it is a reproach to thee, if they have not taught thee more patience and meekneſſe than others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The exemplary or ideal cauſe of patience, is God and Chriſt.</hi> From <note place="margin">4. God and Chriſt are the exemplary cauſe.</note> them we have a moſt exact and compleat rule of patience, <hi>Mat. 5. 48. Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfect, as your heavenly Father is.</hi> To be perfect is there to be <hi>patient,</hi> for he had before inſtanced in the patience of God, that even to the unjuſt he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Sunne to ariſe; and from this inferreth, Be ye therefore perfect: To be patient, and that to enemies, may be called <hi>perfection,</hi> becauſe this alone is taught in Chriſtianity. To love our friends is acknowledged a duty by all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but to love enemies is only profeſſed by Chriſtians. Well then may we be patient under all the perſecutions, reproaches and vexations the enemies of God bring upon us: For is not God patient towards them, and yet they are more his enemies then thine? He that could immediately be avenged on them; he that could command legions of Devils to drag them to hell preſently, yet with much patience ſuffereth them. God is ſo patient, that as <hi>Tertullian, Ipſa ſibi detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hit,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>de pat.) <hi>His patience detracteth from him, he ſeemeth to be a loſer by it.</hi> For people ſinne the more obſtinately and wilfully, becauſe they meet with impunity. <hi>Becauſe vengeance is not ſpeedily executed, therefore the heart of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is encouraged to evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 11. It is true indeed, if we ſpeak properly we cannot attribute the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to God, as if that were an attribute in him. The Scripture uſeth other words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe God being moſt abſolutely bleſſed and happy in himſelf, he cannot be under any miſery: So as to be ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to be patient</hi> under it: neither can God be ſaid to <hi>pati,</hi> to ſuffer, in a paſſive ſenſe, yet his goodneſs, his forbearance, theſe are called <hi>patience.</hi> And from the <hi>patience</hi> of God we may be encouraged to a conformity thereunto. Should God be as impatient of thee, ſhould he as little endure thy failings, as thou canſt his diſpenſations, thou hadſt been with <hi>Dives,</hi> calling for a drop of water long before this time, and not able to partake of it. Chriſt alſo is a wonderfull examplar cauſe of patience, for him to lay aſide the manifeſtation of his glory, to be born of a Virgin, to be expoſed to ſuch an ignominious death: in all which he did ſeem, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Contumelioſus ſibiipſi, Injurious and reproachfull to himſelf;</hi> which made the <hi>Marcionites</hi> ſay, He had only a phantaſtical body, thinking it a reproachfull and diſhonourable thing to him, to have a true real body of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But this exinanition and emptying of himſelf, doth the more commend and make his patience illuſtrious. Hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 23. and in other places, Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as a patern to us of <hi>patience in all our ſufferings;</hi> and certain never may we more ſhame and abhorre our ſelves for all our repining and impatient workings of ſoul, then when we ſet Chriſt before our eyes; he was as a ſheep in the hands of the ſhearer that opened not his mouth: Yet how much did he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer both from God and man, and that without any cauſe in reſpect of himſelf, though juſtly in reſpect of Gods Covenant with him, as our Surety. Now though all this was for us enemies to him, ſuch who would contemn his love, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to crucifie him over and over again, yet in theſe great agonies and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſufferings, he is not impatient. Thus we have heard of a <hi>patience</hi> greater than that of <hi>Job,</hi> even of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and let his patience ſhame thee out of thy impatience.</p>

Some things have been ſpoken to declare the nature of it; I ſhall adde at this time ſome motives and encouragements to be <hi>patient</hi> under the moſt extream ſufferings we are put upon. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, This conſideration may greatly calm and compoſe our ſpirits, <hi>If we</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Motives to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. 1. We ſhould conſider and be affected with what we have deſerved</note> 
                  <hi>ſenſibly affect our ſelves with what we have deſerved.</hi> All-impatiency and turbulency of heart ariſeth, becauſe we are not throughly humbled under our own guilt and unworthineſſe; for if this were taken notice of, we would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, why dogs ſhould have childrens bread, why we ſhould have the leaſt drop of mercy, who deſerve the deluge of Gods wrath. Doeſt thou at any time find repinings and frettings of heart within thee? Do thou preſently poſſeſſe thy ſoul with thy wretchedneſſe and unworthineſſe: Say, Who am I Lord, that it is no worſe? This is not hell, nor everlaſting damnation that I am in, and yet I have a thouſand times over deſerved that. It was this that quieted <hi>David</hi>'s heart under that ſour affliction he conflicted with, when <hi>Abſolom</hi> had made ſuch a ſtrong conſpiracy againſt him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11. when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him with ſuch a grievous curſe, that <hi>Abiſhai</hi> had no patience to bear it, <hi>Why ſhould this dead dog curſe my Lord the King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let me go and take off his head?</hi> Who but a <hi>David</hi> would have been avenged? But what tameth <hi>Davids</hi> heart? <hi>Let him alone, let him curſe, for the Lord hath bidden him. David</hi> knew that it was for his ſins that <hi>Abſolom</hi> rebelled, <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed; and therefore he dare not grudge nor mutter. So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26. while <hi>David</hi> is compaſſed about with the ſame difficulties; ſee how ſoft his heart is, ready to receive any impreſſion; <hi>But if he ſay, I have no delight in him, behold here I am, let him do to me, as ſeemeth good to him.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi>'s heart is like the veſſel caſt into the fire, it may be put into any form, or faſhion; and what is the reaſon of it? A true humbled ſpirit under all its unworthineſſe. Thus the Church <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 22. though ſhe be in ſuch deſolations, that ſhe cals to all the paſſengers who come by, to ſee if there were ever any affliction like hers, yet (ſaith ſhe) <hi>It is of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48709:131"/>
the Lords mercies that we are not conſumed:</hi> As wretched as we are, we might be worſe. It is the Lords mercy that we do but taſte of his cup of wrath, that we do not drink up the dregs. Here is a good patern to write after. Let thy troubles and exerciſes be like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> furnace, heated ſeven times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ordinary, yet thou wilt have cauſe to ſay, if thou regard thy own guilt, <hi>It is of the Lords mercy, that it is no worſe.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 39. Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins?</hi> Art thou a <hi>living man</hi> not a damned man, and doeſt thou complain? Think, what if thy condition were like thoſe that are chained up in everlaſting darkneſs, gnaſhing their teeth, and roaring out for the endleſſe torments that are upon them? Wouldſt thou not then judge this condition thou art in, though afflicted and troubleſome, to be a mercy? Certainly if the damned in hell are bound to acknowledge the juſtice of God, and to give him the glory thereof, though it be in their confuſion; How much rather art thou bound to give God the glory of all his Attributes in theſe diſpenſations to thee, though bitter to fleſh and blood? Take heed then of being like <hi>Jonah,</hi> of ſaying, <hi>Thou doeſt well to be angry.</hi> It is an eaſe to pour forth thy complaints. For what, doth God do thee any wrong? Doth not the worm that eateth up all thy comfort breed in thy own breaſt? Is not thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from thy own ſelf? Certainly if any thing, this may ſtop thy mouth, and quietly compoſe thy ſoul. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not only the apprehenſion of thy guilt may thus rebuke all ſtorms <note place="margin">2. Conſider Gods great goodneſs in changing the nature of thy afflictions.</note> within thee, <hi>But the conſideration of Gods goodneſſe and mercy is admirable, that doth thus alter and change the nature of theſe afflictions that are upon thee.</hi> For whereas thou mightſt have been ſuffering for thy ſinnes, thou now ſuffereſt for God and a good cauſe. Whereas they might have been a curſe, now they are made a bleſſing, whereas they might have adminiſtred all ſorrow and bitterneſs; now thou art to account it all joy, when thou falleſt into divers temptations; give not over ſucking of this honey-comb, till thou haſt got all the ſweetneſſe out of it; God maketh this crown of thorns, a crown of gold; That which might have been a ſtone is turned into bread; The fruit of thy ſinne is made a priviledge and an honour: Hence the godly have alwayes looked upon their ſufferings, as a bleſſed thing, as eminent expreſſions of Gods love to them: Hence in all their troubles they have been more prepared and purified to bleſſe God: As Bels caſt into the fire, do afterwards make a ſweeter and clearer ſound; ſo that this is encouragement enough, to conſider how God changeth the nature of theſe troubles, the fruit of ſinne is made the fruit of Gods love to thee, and alſo of righteouſneſſe to thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Be not dejected under ſufferings for God, but rejoyce with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">3. Conſider that God will be with thee.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe God will be with thee, thou ſhalt have the preſence and aſſiſtance of Chriſt, and then Chriſt being in the ſhip with thee, thou canſt not ſuffer ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. Paul</hi> ſpeaking of that admirable and ſtrong conſtitution of grace, whereby he was able to endure heats and cold, he could abound, and he could want, be changed from one extream condition to another, and yet be the ſame in heart and affection, he addeth, <hi>He can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth him,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. Thou haſt the ſame power with Chriſt in ſome ſenſe; what he can do thou canſt do: as a little child inabled by a Gyant, can do what the Gyant can do. I can do all things; <hi>Paul</hi> hath a kind of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. If then the troubles thou art to combate with were too ſtrong for thee, ſuch as would overwhelm thee, then thou mightſt be impatient and diſcontented, but be quiet and wait for the power of God. See alſo how notably <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10. I take pleaſure in my infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, <hi>For when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 9. Gods ſtrength</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>perfected in Pauls weakneſſe:</hi> moſt gladly therefore <hi>will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt on me.</hi> What wonders and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48709:132"/>
paradoxes doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak? His words are miracles, he will moſt gladly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and rejoyce in all his reproaches; and why? Becauſe hereby Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be the more manifeſted. Thus you ſee great ground for patience, becauſe Cods power will come in, and that very ſeaſonably you will have <hi>grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> called God, <hi>Ipſam opportunitatem, Oppornunity it ſelf,</hi> becauſe he did alwayes come in ſeaſonably to help: How much more may Chriſtians put forth their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and faith in this particular? Thou art ſure to have his gracious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and aſſiſtance, and thou art ſure alſo to have it in the beſt ſeaſon, and moſt opportunely. Let not then impatience ſo trouble the waters of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and bemud them, that thou canſt not ſee the face of God ſhining upon thee, and his arm ſtretched out to help and deliver thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As you have need of patience under theſe exerciſes, <hi>So let it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Conſider what good will redound to thee by thy afflictions.</note> 
                  <hi>have its perfect work, becauſe of the unspeakable good that will redound to thee hereby.</hi> If this be duly weighed, thou wilt bleſſe God for thy ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings more than for all thy mercies and outward ſafety; thou wilt ſee, that to loſe father, and mother, and life it ſelf, is to winne them. God doth by theſe ſufferings bring in <hi>Novum &amp; inauditum modum ſalutis, interire ne poreas,</hi> a new and unheard of way of ſafety, by making thee to die, that thou mayeſt not periſh. We might heap up many places of Scripture that demonſtrate the benefit of ſuch ſufferings. So that the opinion of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> confuteth, was directly oppoſite to Scripture. It ſeemeth the <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> was an hater of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> and accuſed Chriſt of ſeverity and cruelty for requiring ſuch things at the hand of his followers; he thought <hi>Chriſt</hi> was injurious to his people, if he expected ſuch hard things from them; but this made them charge <hi>Chriſt</hi> thus fooliſhly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not conſider that thoſe ſufferings were advantages, that it was no more a loſſe to the godly, then it is to the grains of corn, when thrown into the earth, and die (as it were) there; unleſſe you do ſo to the corn, it cannot bring forth fruit. Thus the godly, except they are thus afflicted, except they have theſe tryals, they are great loſers, and that in a two-fold reſpect. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Their ſpiritual good is promoted by the patient enduring of afflictions.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. What ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good.</note> Our Saviour cals it, <hi>John 15. The purging of the Vine;</hi> that as the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the luxuriant branches do not hinder, but increaſe the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Thus alſo do theſe tribulations, they are like razors to cut off all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities; and therefore compared ſo often to the fire, which doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the droſſe, and make gold more purified. Art thou then impatient, becauſe God taketh away thy corruptions from thee, becauſe he applieth ſuch remedies that will kill thy luſts, and make thee more believing, and more heavenly minded? Do you not ſee the diſeaſed perſon under the Phyſicians care, though for the preſent under auſteer remedies? The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon complains, and cries out, yet afterwards, when by this means he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to perfect health, then he thanketh the Phyſician, and rewards him. Now all thy afflictions and tribulations for Gods cauſe are medicinal: It is God the wiſe Phyſician, that commandeth thee to be thus let blood: Fear not therefore, neither faint under it; this is the way God taketh to ſanctifie and cleanſe thy ſoul; this winnowing will deliver thee from thy chaff; theſe bitter pils will kill thoſe worms of pride, vain-glory, and other luſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's not onely thy ſpiritual good here, <hi>But thy eternal good hereafter that is promoted by theſe ſufferings.</hi> It's the ſalvation of thy ſoul that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed <note place="margin">2. Eternal.</note> in theſe troubles; ſo that thou art to be afraid (as it were) leſt if thou art without theſe here, thou ſhalt be without ſalvation hereafter. Chriſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48709:132"/>
hath promiſed ſo much to him that ſhall loſe any thing for his ſake, that it muſt be high Atheiſm not to believe it. And if thou doeſt believe it, and yet hadſt rather have preſent pleaſures and profits, than future glory, then thou proclaimeſt thy exceeding great folly and madneſſe. If then thou love thy ſelf, thy ſoul, thy ſalvation, be patient in enduring all that God layeth upon thee.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Be patient under ſuch ſufferings, <hi>Becauſe hereby thou promoteſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Conſider by patience thou maiſt promote the good of others</note> 
                  <hi>the good of others, the ſalvation of others.</hi> And certainly this ſhould much prevail with us. Theſe ſufferings of mine, theſe patient endurings for the cauſe of Chriſt may provoke and encourage many others. This did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce <hi>Paul,</hi> and animate him in all his reproaches and difficulties he met with for the Goſpel, becauſe that hereby the Church was more propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. With what joy, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1. 13.) doth he ſpeak of this? <hi>That his bonds were made manifeſt every where, and many of the brethren waxed more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and bold than before.</hi> As on the contrary we ſee the impatience, worldly fears, and Apoſtaſie of ſome have done a world of hurt to others, not only falling themſelves, but making others alſo to tumble down with them. This is a ſad thing to conſider of. If the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. ſpeaks ſo dreadfully about a ſtrong Chriſtian abuſing his liberty, that thereby he is a ſtumbling block, and on his part deſtroyeth him for whom Chriſt died: How much more will this hold true on him, who ſhall perfidiouſly forſake Chriſt rather than ſuffer for him? And although ſome of theſe have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd again, and manifeſted as much faithfulneſſe as they had formerly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, yet thoſe that did wholly fall off, their fall was great, making the adverſary to rejoyce, and animating others to do the like. Therefore on the contrary, if thou endure with conſtancy and patience under all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in nothing being diſmayed, this will imbolden others; thou mayeſt prevent the backſliding of others. Inſomuch that to ſuffer for Chriſt is a great act of love, not only to Chriſt, but to the Church; when with <hi>Paul,</hi> we ſhall be willing to be ſacrified for the good of other mens ſouls. Now this duty of love we owe to the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi> we are bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuffer reproaches, and all manner of trials for righteouſneſſe ſake, not only becauſe Chriſt requireth it, and with reference to him, but alſo out of love to the ſouls, and ſalvation of others. When we ſuffer, we do not only ſuffer as private Chriſtians, but as members of the body; and therefore the concernment of the whole body is in the ſuffering of every member. This then ſhould greatly encourage us in all our afflictions <hi>for Chriſts ſake;</hi> It is not I alone, it's not my ſalvation only, but the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many others is carried on in this buſineſſe. Hence ſome have thought more implied in that expreſſion then ordinarily is conceived, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are made as the filth and off-ſcouring of the world;</hi> they ſay, the words are not to be underſtood only of diſhonour and reproach; but becauſe they were applied to ſuch Sacrifices, and devoted things, in the offering whereof common judgements were removed, <hi>piacula;</hi> therefore they inferre, That the Apoſtles ſufferings did conduce to the whole Church of God. Others come to obtain mercy by following them for an example. I ſhall not plead for this interpretation; onely this is a truth in the general, That many have been converted, and ſo ſaved by beholding the courage and patience of godly Confeſſors and Martyrs. It's then a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we owe to the Church of God, to ſuffer when Chriſt requireth. And if we read of <hi>Heathens,</hi> the <hi>Curtii</hi> and <hi>Decii,</hi> who have devoted themſelves to preſent death, to remove ſome publick calamity, what ſhame will this be to Chriſtians, if they ſhall not in a regular way ſhew ſuch zeal for the Church of God? We have a notable paſſage, 1 <hi>John 3. 16. We ought to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48709:133"/>
lay down our lives for the brethren;</hi> What Chriſt did for us, we are to do for the Church. So that from this Text it is plain, there are caſes and inſtances wherein a man is bound to loſe not only wealth and eſtate, but even life it ſelf for others. Hence there is a diſtinction of <hi>Martyrium charitatis,</hi> and <hi>Martyrium fidei.</hi> A <hi>Jeſuite</hi> (Raynardus <hi>de Martyrio.)</hi> doth induſtriouſly endeavour to maintain, <hi>That if a man, having a call from God, doth venture his life by viſiting ſome infected with the plague, doing this out of love to God, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſouls, ſuch a man is as truly and properly a Martyr, and that in a ſtrict ſenſe, as one who dieth for witneſſing the faith.</hi> I ſhall not here examine this point; only in the general we may conclude, That he who layeth down his life for the brethren, for the ſpiritual good of others, having a call thereunto, he he is a Martyr, and may encourage himſelf with all thoſe promiſes, that thoſe who died for the faith have done: Yea ſuch a ſuffering and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome may be called <hi>Martyrium fidei,</hi> as well as <hi>charitatis,</hi> or <hi>miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diae;</hi> Faith having imperate acts, as well as elicite. Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. attributeth divers worthy actions and atchievements unto <hi>Faith.</hi> By this you ſee in any ſuffering whereby the Church of God is edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherein we demonſtrate our love to the ſalvation of others, we may greatly encourage our ſelves. Hence alſo it is obſerved by one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, <hi>That he who ſhall ſuffer to prevent ſchiſms and breaches in the Church of God, is more to be honoured, than he who ſuffereth, becauſe he would not offer to an Idol, becauſe here is more love to the Church of God.</hi> Let this then in all ſufferings, whether verbal, or real, mightily ſupport thee, that not my own ſalvation onely, but the good and ſalvation of all thoſe, who ſhall come to hear or know this, will alſo be furthered. To be a meanes of converſion by ſuffering, is in ſome reſpect greater than by preaching.</p>

                  <hi>Peace,</hi> which containeth a confluence of all good things. The <hi>Heathens</hi> did ſo admire it, that they built a Temple <hi>Deae Saluti,</hi> to the <hi>Goddeſſe Safety;</hi> though they underſtood only a temporal ſafety; and therefore when they were ſaved or delivered from dangers, they did offer their Sacrifices called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; Thus they thought all their ſafety came from Heaven, though corrupted with blind minds. In the Scripture we read of a two-fold ſalvation: A <hi>Temporal</hi> one; and the Old Teſtament ſpeaketh much of this ſalvation, becauſe <hi>temporal mercies</hi> were in a more plentifull manner vouchſafed to them; not but that the godly looked for a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſalvation, as <hi>Jacob</hi> witneſſeth in his benedictory prayer before his death, ſaying, <hi>Gen. 49. 18. I have waited for thy ſalvation, O Lord;</hi> only ſpiritual things were not ſo clearly and plainly manifeſted, as in the Goſpel times. Hence the Temple, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 4. had windows indeed, but they were of narrow lights. This <hi>Salvation temporal</hi> is often in the Old Teſtament expreſſed in the plural number, <hi>The ſalvations of the Lord,</hi> becauſe of the multitude and Frequency of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>ſpiritual Salvation;</hi> and this is ſometimes applied to the Goſpel and means of grace, becauſe they are inſtituted <hi>means</hi> to bring to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> Act. 13. 26. It's called the <hi>Word of ſalvation.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2. <hi>Behold now is the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Heb. 2. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> So that the very title which is given to the preaching of the Goſpel, ſhould partly much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and winne upon us; who would not be ſaved? Why ſhould not all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations endeavour after a godly Miniſtry? This is to bring in <hi>Salvation</hi> amongſt them: And partly it ſhould terrifie all prophane atheiſtical men, who delight in their luſts, and ſlight the Goſpel preached; what is this but to refuſe ſalvation? What is this but to ſay, Let me be damned, I had rather with my luſts go to hell, then without them to Heaven? Every Sermon thou deſpiſeſt, <hi>ſalvation</hi> it ſelf is rejected by thee. But then, 2. This <hi>ſpiritual Salvation</hi> is either <hi>inchoate,</hi> or <note place="margin">Spiritual ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inchoate or conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</note> 
                  <hi>conſummate. Inchoate</hi> or <hi>Salvation begun,</hi> is attributed to the works of grace in this life, Sanctification, eſpecially Juſtification. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. and 2. 8. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved;</hi> he ſpeaks of Juſtification in this life, and as that which is

                  </gap>ained, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Juſtification</hi> is <hi>ſalvation begun,</hi> though good works are otherwayes required to one and the other. The <hi>Conſummate</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Salvation,</hi> is that in Heaven, which is the <hi>Salvation</hi> ſo often promiſed in the Scripture, and that is the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> and the <hi>ultius finis,</hi> the mark all are to aim at. The Scripture doth clearly deſcribe that, which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers did grope in the dark about, having many ſeveral opinions about it. That as our Saviour asked his Diſciples, <hi>Whom do men ſay I am?</hi> And they anſwered, <hi>Some John Baptiſt, ſome Elias.</hi> Now though theſe were holy men, yet it was a diſhonour to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be accounted no more than a man; Woe be to us, if Chriſt had been no more than a meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Seeing therefore theſe did ſo miſtake, our Saviour asketh further; <hi>But whom ſay ye that I am?</hi> Then <hi>Peter</hi> anſwered, <hi>The Sonne, of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</hi> It was the Father, not fleſh and blood that had revealed this. Thus if you ask, What do the men of the world ſay <hi>Happineſſe</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> is? One will reply, Riches; another, Honours; but what do ye ſay, who are more than fleſh and blood, who have the Spirit of God revealing things to you? Even <hi>the enjoyment of God and Chriſt to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> this is <hi>Salvation,</hi> this is <hi>Bleſſedneſſe.</hi> This <hi>Salvation</hi> is that which we are to endeavour after in our whole life. Better never have been borne, and not ſaved. What will it profit thee to have had a little pleaſure, a little greatneſſe and honour in this life, and hereafter to loſe this ſalvation? There are ſome places of Scripture, wherein it's diſputed, what <hi>Salvation</hi> is ſpoken of, whether <hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> or both? 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 20. Eight perſons</hi> were ſaid to be <hi>ſaved in the Ark.</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>The righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſaved.</hi> The <hi>Arminian</hi> would bring that place, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 10. Who is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all men,</hi> to a ſpiritual ſalvation. But that is abſurd, for he ſpeaks of being an actual Saviour, and that cannot be to wicked men, for they are not ſaved, therefore it is of a <hi>temporal preſervation;</hi> for even to wicked men he vouchſafeth daily ſalvations and deliverances. Now it is plain my Text ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a <hi>ſpiritual Salvation,</hi> and that which is to come, called <hi>eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God doth by all his dispenſations carry on and further the ſalvation of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God doth by all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations carry on and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his people.</note> 
                  <hi>his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If others be afflicted, if others be comforted, all helpeth forward to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe that believe. In this ſenſe it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. ult. All things are yours.</hi> The Officers and Miniſters of the Church, life and death, things preſent, and things to come, How are all theſe things a godly mans? Even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they further his ſalvation; by all theſe he promoteth the happineſſe of his people. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> knew, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 19. that all his enemies practices, yea their preaching Chriſt out of envy, thinking thereby to afflict him more, yet this would all turn to his ſalvation. What Doctrine can be fuller of comfort than this, to conſider that what ever befalleth thee, whatſoever Gods diſpenſations are towards thee, yet all doth advance thy ſalvation, thou ſhalt not be a loſer by any thing? The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed they were hindred and put backwards in their journey to <hi>Canaan,</hi> being fourty years detained therein, when their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Canaan</hi> might have been farre ſooner; but our journey to Heaven is haſtened by every thing, yea our very ſtumblings do make us afterwards go the faſter.</p>
               <p>To open this, Conſider. <note place="margin">What this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation doth imply. 1. It is Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What this Salvation doth imply;</hi> and therein is connoted the ſtate and condition from which we are ſaved, that we were in danger of being loſt in the contrary eſtate. Thus it is called a <hi>Salvation,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48709:134"/>
a man by his ſins was in danger of being eternally damned, and loſt in ſoul and body for ever. Even as you ſee it was with <hi>Lot,</hi> when he was in <hi>Sodom,</hi> fire and brimſtone was ready to conſume the City; now God being mercifull to him, he ſendeth an <hi>Angel</hi> even to pull him out. Thus it is with every one that is ſaved, he was in a ſtate deſerving the brimſtone and fire of hell, within a little time it would have been poured upon him; but God in much mercy pulleth him out; his neighbours (it may be) they are loſt, ſome in the ſame family, ſome of his brethren or ſiſters, yea it may be his parents, they are loſt in this fire, and he is delivered; this is to be ſaved. It may alſo be emphatically reſembled by <hi>Noahs Ark,</hi> when the deluge overwhelmed the whole world, there were but eight perſons put into the Ark, and ſaved from the waters. Think in what fear and agonies the reſt were, how deſirous to come into the Ark; and of all mankind there were but eight preſerved. Thus thoſe who ſhall be ſaved, are but very few in compariſon of thoſe who ſhall eternally periſh. And at the day of judgment, what praying and crying will there be, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us;</hi> but they ſhall be commanded to <hi>depart into everlaſting fire.</hi> So that while we are here in this life, we cannot tell what it is to be ſaved; we know not how to put a due eſteem and prize upon it: But at the day of judgement, when the world ſhall be on fire, when all ſhall ſtand trembling at the barre of Gods juſtice; then for you to hear God call ſuch and ſuch an one, Come into Heaven as an Ark, come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of eternal glory; but to thee God ſhall ſay, Go thou curſed. Oh the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able horrour and confuſion that will then fall on thee! What worlds wouldſt thou give then to be ſaved? What cries and agonies wilt thou then roar out for thy ſalvation, but it will be denied thee? Salvation will one day be in requeſt, and accounted a bleſſed and happy thing, though now it be contemned by thee, and thou thinkeſt thy luſts will be better then ſalvation to thee. In what a pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical manner doth our Saviour repreſent this? <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. to 28. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall ſtrive to enter in:</hi> And when the Maſter hath ſhut the door, <hi>then thoſe that ſtand without ſhall knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but he ſhall bid them, depart, then there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth; when ye ſhall ſee Abraham and Iſaac,</hi> ſuch and ſuch godly men <hi>received, and your ſelves thruſt out.</hi> Doth not our Saviour ſpeak thus, who is truth it ſelf? Oh imagine all theſe things to be now a doing! Let faith make future things preſent. If this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will not make a change in thee, what canſt thou expect, but to be in the number of thoſe, who ſhall for ever be denied this ſalvation?</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Salvation doth not only denote a Negative, a freedom from all this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Poſitive.</note> 
                  <hi>but alſo a Poſitive, a ſtate of glory, holineſſe and happineſſe, and that to all eternity.</hi> Thus it is deſcribed in Scripture by all ſuch poſitive good things, that may make us readily part with all, leave all for this condition. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> was not only ſaved from death, and from the priſon, but advanced alſo to high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory. Thus <hi>Salvation</hi> doth not only deliver from hell torments and everlaſting wrath, but alſo doth give us poſſeſſion of all holineſſe and perfect bleſſedneſſe. This is the ſalvation God hath provided for thoſe that fear him. No wonder if all afflictions be born patiently in expectation of this. No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if this be in the eye, and hope of all the godly. Were it not for this ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how miſerable and wretched ſhould they judge themſelves? This is the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation that we are commanded to make ſure of in this life, and who would live in uncertainties about it? Is it not day and night worth the ſtriving for? This is the ſalvation that every wicked man wilfully depriveth himſelf of. It is for this that ſinne is juſtly called <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>madneſſe;</hi> and well may it be ſo ſtyled. For can there be greater ſottiſhneſſe and madneſſe to put thy ſelf from this ſalvation, to have the pleaſures and profits of this world, which abide but for a ſeaſon? No wonder if the damned in hell weep and gnaſh their teeth; if they have a worm al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gnawing of them, a conſcience always torturing and tormenting of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48709:135"/>
for a drop of honey, they are rewarded with an ocean of gall. Would the damned in hell do as they once did, if they were to live again? Have they ſuch thoughts, ſuch purpoſes, now they are roaring in thoſe flames, which they had, while in their carnal jollity? Oh that God would perſwade you about theſe things!</p>
               <p>But I proceed. <hi>This happy and bleſſed eſtate is promoted,</hi> as the Doctrine infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth us, <hi>by all the dispenſations which the people of God meet with.</hi> That as paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers in a ſhip are ſtill carried on to the haven, though ſick and well, though waking and ſleeping, yet every moment they are driven forward to their home. Thus the people of God, if afflicted, this helpeth forward to Heaven; if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, this alſo maketh for Heaven. So that let the Devil be never ſo buſie a Lion to devour them; let the world be filled with never ſo many ſnares, yet the counſel of God cannot be fruſtrated. That gracious purpoſe of God to bring them to ſalvation will be effectual, and be accompliſhed even by thoſe things that ſeem to oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>there are two ſorts of dispenſations from God, which further the ſalvation of belivers.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Two ſorts of diſpenſations from God which further the ſalvation of a believer. 1. The direct means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for this end.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There are thoſe things that are means inſtituted and appointed by God,</hi> and ſo do <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>genuinely</hi> tend to ſave them; and theſe are the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Miniſtry, the preaching of the Word, and the Sacraments. Theſe do in Gods way wonderfully promote the ſalvation of thoſe that are rightly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therein. Hence you heard, that the preaching of the Goſpel is called <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> becauſe it doth ſo directly work thereunto; and thoſe who fear God, do find theſe Ordinances very powerfull for their ſalvation. They are like the ſaws and hammers, that did prepare and poliſh the ſtones to be fit for the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that to be deprived of theſe, to be denied theſe, is even to be deprived or denied ſalvation it ſelf: Only when we ſay, they are means inſtituted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſalvation, You muſt not think there is any intrinſecal vertue in theſe, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſpeak about the Word preached; or as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, working ſalvation, as Phyſick doth health by a natural cauſality: No the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>That in ſome it is not the Word of life, but of death,</hi> 2 Cor., 2. 16. It's to ſome people as the <hi>Ark</hi> to the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> becauſe not uſed aright, it becomes their further damnation.</p>

                  <q>And our hope of you is ſtedfaſt, knowing that as you are partakers of the ſufferings, ſo ſhall ye be alſo of the conſolation.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THeſe words (brought in, as ſome ſay, be a parentheſis) are by way of mitigation and mollifying the minds of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> in his former Epiſtle having ſeverely reproved them, it obtained good ſucceſſe, and procured ſome ſpiritual effect upon them, for they were made ſorrowfull thereby, and ſet upon the work of Reformation. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the falſe Apoſtles had too much prevailed with them, yet they were brought to a ſounder temper than formerly. Neither were <hi>Pauls</hi> afflictions ſuch matter of contempt as formerly; yea they are partakers of the ſame ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings with him. Theſe things laid together, maketh <hi>Paul</hi> uſe theſe encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ſoftning paſſages; to rebukes we muſt joyn meekneſſe and love toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Artificer cannot build his houſe with hard brick or ſtone, he muſt have his ſoft mortar to cement them together: Rigidneſſe to rigidneſſe will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unite. There muſt be yeelding as well as ſeverity, elſe the edification of Gods Church cannot proceed.</p>
               <p>The words are a profeſſion of <hi>Pauls</hi> charitable eſteem and loving apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them, though ſometimes he doth rebuke them very ſharply. If he had ſaid, I have no hopes of you, no Epiſtle, or writing will do you any good, this might have more hardened them in obſtinacy. Yea as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth on this place, He ſpeaketh more hopefully and confidently of theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> then he doth of the <hi>Theſſalonians:</hi> For, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4, 5. he there diſcovereth the holy jealouſie and fear he had, leſt they ſhould be oot much moved with the afflictions that do accompany the Goſpel, <hi>When I could no longer forbear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſent Timotheus to eſtabliſh you, that no man ſhould be moved by theſe afflictions.</hi> Again he repeateth it, <hi>When I could no longer forbear, I ſent to know your faith, leſt by ſome means the tempter ſhould tempt you.</hi> By theſe vehement and doubled affectionate expreſſions, you ſee with what a holy jealouſie he was poſſeſſed concerning them, but he ſpeaketh
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48709:136"/>
farre more confidently about theſe <hi>Corinthians, Our hope of you is ſtedfaſt,</hi> That which the Apoſtle here calleth <hi>his hope,</hi> he doth often in other places name <hi>his perſwaſion,</hi> Heb. 6. 9. <hi>We are perſwaded better things of you. 2 Tim. 1. 5. I am perſwaded that the ſame faith dwelleth in thee alſo.</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 12. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> calleth him <hi>a faithfull brother, (1 Pet. 5. 12.) as I ſuppoſe.</hi> The word doth not there denote any doubt or fear about him; for that is contrary to the Apoſtles ſcope, who intends to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him; but it ſignifieth a firm and ſtedfaſt judgement concerning his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Now the Queſtion is, <hi>What is that hope and perſwaſion, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What is that hope and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion which <hi>Paul</hi> had of other men. A two-fold hope, Divine and Moral.</note> 
                  <hi>which Paul had concerning other men?</hi> To underſtand this you muſt know, <hi>Paul</hi> had a two-fold <hi>hope,</hi> A <hi>Divine Hope,</hi> and a <hi>Charitable</hi> or <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Hope,</hi> which we may call a <hi>Moral Hope. Divine Hope is a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grace wrought by God in the heart of Paul, and ſo in every believer, whereby he is enabled to put his confidence in God, expecting from him onely what he ſtands in need of.</hi> So that of Divine Hope God is the efficient, and God alſo is the object on which it is determined, and as we muſt not believe in any thing, but God, ſo nether hope in any thing but God. Of this Divine <note place="margin">What is the Divine hope. What Moral hope is.</note> Hope <hi>Paul</hi> doth not here ſpeak, he doth not ſay, <hi>Our hope in you is ſtedfaſt,</hi> but <hi>of you,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as thoſe Prepoſitions are often changed.) Therefore it is a <hi>Moral Hope which is grounded upon principles of prudence and charity, by which</hi> Paul <hi>was bound to judge thus favourably of them. Paul</hi> could not tell the hearts of thoſe he wrote to; he could not infallibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, whether they were hypocrites, or ſincere, onely he judgeth the tree by the fruits. Yet you muſt not underſtand this, as ſpoken o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and individual, but collectively; for he writeth to them as a body, and a Church, and ſo it muſt be underſtood indefinitely, not determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this or that perſon. It is true indeed, there was in the primitive times, among other extraordinary gifts, that of the diſcerning of ſpirits (if by <hi>Spirit</hi> we are not rather to mean Doctrines pretended to be of the Spirit, as 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. rather than the hearts and frames of mens ſpirits.) For although abſolutely, originally and independently it be Gods only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to know the hearts of men; yet in ſome caſes, as in <hi>Eliſha</hi> with <hi>Gehezi,</hi> God may reveal the thoughts and ſecret motions of heart to others; but this is extraordinary, not conſtant, no more than working of miracles. So that it is a very abſurd opinion of thoſe that are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who ſay, That light within them diſcovers what is in other mens hearts, abuſing that place, <hi>The ſpiritual man judgeth all things,</hi> whereas the Apoſtle there informeth us, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. That no man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of man, which is within him.</hi> The perſwaſion then or hope, <hi>Paul</hi> had of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was not divine and infallible, in which he could not be deceived, but of an inferiour nature, yet not light and fooliſh neither: for he ſaith, <hi>It was</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>unſhaken,</hi> that is, not like the waves of the Sea. So that <hi>Pauls</hi> hope did not fluctuate about him, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>abiding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing.</hi> It was not hope at ſometimes, and fear at another, but it did abide and dwell in him. Obſerve, <note place="margin">'Tis a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Miniſters of God, to have good grounds for the hope of grace and ſtedfaſtneſſe in their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a great encouragement to a godly Miniſter, to ſee good grounds for the hope of true grace and ſtedfaſtneſſe in Gods wayes, in the people committed to his charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was that which did here refreſh <hi>Paul,</hi> that though he was put to many exerciſes and temptations about them; yet his hope was, that as it is ſaid of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> his ſickneſſe <hi>was not unto death, but that the glory of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48709:136"/>
God might be manifested.</hi> So thoſe failings and decayes amongſt the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were not for their deſtruction, but by their recovery and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to manifeſt the truth of grace more in them. In moſt of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles you may ſee this ſpiritual and publick affection in him, where any are decaying or falling off, there his heart is wounded within him, where any flouriſh and continue ſtedfaſt in holineſſe, there he rejoyceth and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. How notably doth he ſpeak, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 3. 7. We were comforted over you in all our afflictions by your faith: for now we live, if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord.</hi> Here we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> did not ſo much regard his own afflictions and diſtreſſe, as the grace of the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> and becauſe they did not abate in their faith by the afflictions they met with, therefore this comforted him in all his diſtreſſe: Yea he profeſſeth he liveth, if they ſtand faſt, as if their Apoſtaſie would be worſe than all his troubles to him, yea would break his heart, and be his death. The Epiſtle alſo to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who began to decay and to end in the fleſh after their beginning in the Spirit, doth abundantly declare what agonies he was in about them, <hi>Galat. 4. 19. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children of whom I travail again in birth:</hi> he compareth thoſe troubles and exerciſes of his mind about them to the pangs and groans of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in travail, <hi>Who hath bewitched you,</hi> Galat. 3. 1. By this you may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the joyes of <hi>Paul</hi> did ebbe or flow according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe of the graces of theſe he had ſpiritual inſpection over.</p>
               <p>To diſcover this truth, Let us conſider, <hi>What things made</hi> Paul <hi>have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What things they were which made <hi>Paul</hi> hope ſo well of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> 1. Their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by his former Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuch hopes about theſe</hi> Corinthians, and apply theſe things to our ſelves And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Their amendment and repentance,</hi> by the former Epiſtle wrote to them, in that you may ſee the body of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was almoſt like <hi>Jobs</hi> or <hi>Lazaruſſes</hi> body, full of ſpiritual loathſomneſſe, corruptions in Doctrine and practice, and ſome of them in a very high nature, for which our zealous Apoſtle, as the Lord Chriſt once did, maketh a rod to drive theſe corruptions out, he is both a light ſhining and burning; he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to that rule, which he giveth <hi>Timothy, Rebuke ſharply, and reprove in all Doctrine.</hi> He is ſalt to theſe <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Now theſe ſharp reproofes do not provoke them to diſcontent, to impatience; but it had a ſavoury and ſpiritual operation upon them. If he ſaid, <hi>Genus quoddam eſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrii reprehenſionem patienter ferre, It's a kind of Martyrdome to ſuffer reproof patiently;</hi> then theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were <hi>Martyrs</hi> in this ſenſe; for they did not onely take theſe rebukes well, but are thereby put upon a zealous and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull repentance. So that when this ſpiritual Phyſician ſaw his medicines kindly operate, then he began to hope well of them. On the other ſide, we ſe the Prophets complaining of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as <hi>incurable, Becauſe ſhe ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prophets, and ſtoned them,</hi> ſo that there remained no more reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for them. The Prophets complained, <hi>They ſtretched out their hands all the day long to a rebellious people, and that the bellows were conſumed, yet the droſſe was not purged away,</hi> This then is a very hopefull ſymptome about a people, when we ſee by the Word preached, that their hearts are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that they are counvinced and aſhamed of what they have done, and reforme for the future. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh fully to this, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 8, 9, 10, 11. This ſelf ſame thing that you were made ſorry after a godly manner; what carefulneſſe it wrought in you, yea what zeal, what revenge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In all things you have approved your ſelves to be clear in this matter.</hi> Oh the carefulneſſe and zeal that was in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> after <hi>Pauls</hi> admonitions to repent and reform. So that he had good grounds to ſay, <hi>Our hope of you is ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.</hi> Oh then, let our Congregations be examined and tried in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48709:137"/>
particular. What repentance and reformation hath the prophane man ſhewed after the many admonitions to him? What Reformation is there made about the holy and ſtrict obſervation of the Sabbath? What carefull performances of holy duties in thy family, concerning which thou haſt heard ſo much? Oh that we had cauſe to ſay of ſuch perſons, of ſuch families, though once we fear'd for them, though once we mourned and grieved for them, yet now we rejoyce, and our hope of them is very ſtedfaſt. But may we not cry, woe, woe, and again woe to our Congregations, that are like <hi>Golgothaes,</hi> places not of dead mens skuls, but dead hearts; yea dead men, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead.</hi> Have not the Miniſters of God been many yeares laying the Axe of the Word to the root of prophaneneſſe and ignorance, which is in moſt families, in moſt Congregations? Yet how greatly doth it abound? Surely of ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, of ſuch Congregations, we may with grief of heart ſay, <hi>As yet we have no hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This is more particularly obſervable in the</hi> Corinthians <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up that good and holy order which was thrown down.</note> 
                  <hi>that they repair and ſet up that good and holy order, which was collap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongst them.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Chap. 2. 5. <hi>He did rejoyce to behold their order:</hi> So might he here. In his former Epiſtle he ſeverely taxeth them for want of <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> that they neglected good order; there was a ſcandalous ſinner ſuffered amongſt them, and they did not mourn and humble themſelves, becauſe of it; they did not caſt him out, and free the Church from that contagion; therefore with many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he preſſeth them to gather together, and to execute Church-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to caſt out this wicked perſon from amongſt them, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. which accordingly they did. or were about to do; yea they ſeem to fall into too much auſterity from their laxe indulgence and connivence at ſinne to too much ſeverity againſt a penitent humbled ſinner, as appeareth 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. where the Apoſtle exhorts them, <hi>To confirm their love to the inceſtuous perſon, now deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of his ſinne, leſt he be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow.</hi> When therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw that thoſe who had ſuch diſorders in their Church, no zeal againſt ſinners, no endeavours to purge out the old leaven, to be ſo greatly changed, that they are hardly perſwaded to moderate their zeal; this may well provoke him to ſay, <hi>His hope was ſtedfaſt of them.</hi> For if they would have been remiſſe, and negligent in any thing, it would have been about Church-order. For we ſee ſound Doctrine is ſooner received into any Church, than holy Diſcipline; There were but few Kings among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a Reformation of the diſorder which was about Ordinances; and it is noted as a peculiar work of God upon thoſe mens hearts, who were ready there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; as for the other they mocked and derided at ſuch a pious endeavour, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 10, 11, 12. There was the hand of God upon ſome in a ſpecial manner to induce them thereunto. The Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Revel. 2. 2. is commended, <hi>Becauſe ſhe could not bear thoſe that were evil.</hi> It argueth the ſtrength of the ſtomack to exonerate it ſelf of burdenſome humours. So that by this we ſee, That the hopes of thoſe who are faithfull Guides in the Church, are greatly quenched concerning ſuch who are refractory, and adverſaries to that holy order which would deliver the Congregation from the ignorance and prophaneneſſe abiding there. The very <hi>Heathens</hi> will riſe up in judgement againſt them, who would admit no prophane ſinner to their <hi>Heatheniſh Rites,</hi> witneſſe that known acclamation, <hi>Procul, ô procul eſte prophani.</hi> The Prieſt alſo about to ſacrifice, asked, <gap reason="foreign">

into groſſe ſinnes, they ejected him, and ſent a Coffin to him made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſignifying thereby, that he was no better than a dead corpſe. Yea, the <hi>Socinians</hi> though blaſpheming the Deity of Chriſt, will condemn ſuch carnal Goſpellers. For this is one argument they uſe againſt the Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that there is not ſuch holy order againſt prophane and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ſinners, as ought to be. Yea ſome of them go ſo farre, as to ſay, That that is not a Church, which hath not Diſcipline. If then <hi>Heathens</hi> and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereticks have been zealous for purity about their religious Rites; how hopeleſſe are they, who had rather with the <hi>Gadarens</hi> have Chriſt go out of their Countrey, then be deprived of their ſwiniſh luſts?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Laſtly, <hi>Pauls</hi> hope was therefore ſtedfaſt concerning the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Becauſe they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with <hi>Paul</hi> in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſuffering for Chriſt.</note>

It's an hopefull ſign of an honeſt and ſincere heart, when thou canſt cleave to Chriſt, and confeſſe his Name in the midſt of all perſecutions: Then Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Now I know thou loveſt me, becauſe thou haſt not withholden thy deareſt comforts for my ſake.</hi> When under perſecutions for Chriſts name, thou canſt rejoyce, and not as <hi>Bonaventure</hi> expreſſeth it, be like the Cart-wheel, which while it beareth its burden, doth ſometimes make an harſh and unpleaſant noiſe. Chriſt hath both his Summer and his Winter for his Church; and therefore this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Habet Lilia ſua &amp; roſas ſuas,</hi> Her Lilies in time of peace, and her Roſes in time of perſecution. Now thoſe that love Chriſt more than father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or life it ſelf; and then (as it followeth) <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 37, 38. take up his croſſe; for this can never be done without the former; theſe do give great hopes of the truth of grace in them. Now the ground of this encouragement to a godly Miniſter is, the ſtate of grace here, and of glory hereafter. For his flock is both the end of his work, and the end of him that worketh.

What a joyfull thing would it be to have good hopes of the work of grace in every one that belongeth to his charge? So that thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, diſſoluteneſſe, and ſuch damnable wayes are the grief and trouble, the thorns in the ſides of thoſe, who are to give an account for thee.

               <p>IN theſe words we have a Declaration or Specification, wherein, or wherefore <hi>the hope of the Apoſtle was thus ſtedfaſt</hi> concerning them; it is, becauſe they did not wholly caſt off <hi>Paul,</hi> and contemn him for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as the falſe Apoſtles endeavoured. The Apoſtles hope was ſtedfaſt (as you heard) not like the hope that we ſometimes have, which is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and uncertain. For how many are there with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Abab</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome judgements of God, or under ſome exquiſite agonies of the ſoul, which complain of their ſinnes, cry out of their impieties? So that we have ſome buddings of hope concerning them, till at laſt they daſh all, and diſappoint all expectation by their Apoſtaſie; but ſuch is not the Apoſtles hope concerning theſe, he hath a ſurer foundation; and therefore he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>a good participation or copartnerſhip,</hi> of which the Text here <note place="margin">2. In what is good.</note> ſpeaketh. Though <hi>Paul</hi> was perſecuted and ſuffered much for the preaching of the Goſpel, yet this did not deterre the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> or make them to be ſcandalized at Chriſt, and ſo to fall off from him; but they looked upon <hi>Pauls</hi> ſufferings, as their own, and ſo are affected with his perſecutions, as if they themſelves were perſecuted. This was it which made <hi>Paul</hi> have ſuch a ſtedfaſt hope of their ſincerity; for if their foundation had been ſandy, ſuch tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous winds would have overthrown all. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a partaking of, and communion with thoſe who ſuffer for Chriſt, is a ſure</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thoſe who ſuffer for Chriſt, is a fair way to their joy and glory.</note> 
                  <hi>way to intereſt in all that joy and glory which ſuch ſufferers ſhall at laſt receive from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhall partake with <hi>Paul</hi> in joy and glory, becauſe they are willing to partake with him in afflictions and perſecutions. The joy that is ſpoken of in the Text, is a diſtinct thing from glory and eternal happineſſe; for that is not till the Reſurrection, but Conſolation is for the preſent while we are here in the valley of tears. And indeed if we take conſolation for the reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reviving of the heart under miſeries, ſo it cannot be in Heaven, but in this world only.</p>
               <p>To diſcover this truth, conſider</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That there may be a two-fold participation of, or fellowſhip with others</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. A two-fold communion with the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. 1. When a man living in peace and quietneſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> 
                  <hi>that are in afflictions:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When though we our ſelves are freed and delivered from all troubles, enjoying all outward peace and quietneſſe, yet we are compaſſionately affected with the condition of all thoſe members of Chriſt upon the earth who may be in an afflicted and troubled eſtate.</hi> For ſeeing all the people of God make up one body, if any part thereof ſuffer, the other parts condole and ſuffer with it: Inſomuch that it is plain, thou art a dead part in the body, deſtitute of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, if thou canſt ſee the Church of God, or any part thereof lie wounded like the man of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and thou like the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>Levite</hi> paſſe by, not laying it to heart. This <hi>fellowſhip in ſuffering</hi> is part of the Apoſtles meaning, which he attributeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and is indeed a good and ſure hope of grace in whomſoever we find it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. The Apoſtle there exhorts <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſuch as are in bonds,</hi> but how? Not in a ſuperficial careleſſe manner, but as cordially and affectionately, as if we were bound with them. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that if thou wert impoveriſhed, if thou wert baniſhed, if thou wert im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, how much would it poſſeſſe thy heart all the day long? No leſſe is to be done for others, whom God thus exerciſes. The Scripture doth much delight in the compariſon of the Church with the natural body, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the intimate conjunction and ſympathy which is between the members
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48709:139"/>
if one be honoured, all rejoyce; if one be pained, all grieve. The Prophet complaineth, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 6. of thoſe <hi>who enjoyed their pleaſures, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves merry, but did not remember the afflictions of Joſeph.</hi> Know then, that it is a ſpecial touchſtone of thy grace, when with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> thou haſt all things that can be deſired for thy private content, yet doeſt mourn and pray, becauſe of the deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and this may be one anſwer to that Queſtion, Why ſhould you ſpeak ſo much of afflictions and troubles to thoſe who have none at all? For let that be granted, yet are all the Churches of God in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and freedom? Look abroad and see how it fareth with many that call on the Name of Chriſt; and thou wilt have cauſe to ſee, that though thou art not afflicted outwardly, yet in thy heart and ſoul thou art to be afflicted in all the afflictions of others. Why doeſt thou live, as if thou wert not of the body? Be of a more publick ſpirit, let the Churches gain, or loſſes be as thine own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a fellowſhip with the afflictions of others, not onely ſpiritual, but real, when we are caſt into the ſame outward condition, as others are.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. When a man is caſt into the ſame outward condition.</note> And this alſo may be part of the meaning in the Text. They were not onely Spectators of <hi>Pauls</hi> troubles, but they themſelves had part of this burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own ſhoulders: That cup of tribulation was given them to drink, as well as others. For although perſecutions do ſometimes fall onely upon the Paſtors and Officers in the Church, yet for the moſt part it is univerſal, and purſueth all that call on Chriſt: That as with Chriſt there is no bond or free, no <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> all are one; ſo it is alſo with the enemies of Gods Church in their perſecutions, all are one to them. Look not then for an Ark, when all the people of God ſhall be in the waters. Though an <hi>Obadiah</hi> may live quietly in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court, when the <hi>Elijahs</hi> are ſought for, to be put to death, yet this is not alwayes ſo; and that man, who will own Chriſt upon no other condition, but that he may not ſuffer for him, or be perſecuted for him, that man is unſound and rotten at the very heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider that it is no leſſe glorious before men, and acceptable</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It is as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to be a companion to ſufferers, as to ſuffer.</note> 
                  <hi>unto God, to be a companion and an aſſociate with thoſe who do ſuffer, then if we did ſuffer our ſelves in our own perſon.</hi> This hath been alwayes a very hard task for fleſh and blood, to own the godly, while they are in a ſuffering condition. The Diſciples themſelves proved cowards and unfaithfull in this temptation: for <hi>when the Shepherd was ſmitten, all the ſheep were ſcattered.</hi> When Chriſt was to be crucified, all his Apoſtles fled from him, they dared not own him; and when <hi>Peter</hi> was charged to be one of Chriſts company, <hi>He curſeth and ſweareth, he did not know the man;</hi> he was afraid to own ſo much as the very knowledge of Chriſt. Indeed the godly women, <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Chriſt, and others, they ſhewed more grace and courage than the very Apoſtles, that all honour and glory may be given to God alone; but as for his Diſciples, they hid themſelves, and were afraid to be companions with him. Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33. exhorting believers, <hi>To call to mind their enduring of a great fight of afflictions,</hi> he inſtanceth wherein, partly, <hi>Whileſt ye were made a gazing ſtock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly whileſt ye became companions of them, that were ſo uſed.</hi> Here you ſee, to become a companion to thoſe that ſuffer, not to flie from them, or forſake them, is made a great expreſſion of their love to God. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. remembers what <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> did to him, while in bonds, he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, as if he would never have it forgotten any more, than that womans box of ointment poured on Chriſt. <hi>The Lord give mercy to the houſe of Oneſipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> Why? Becauſe he anſwered his name indeed, <hi>He oft refreſhed me, he ſought me out very diligently, and was not aſhamed of my chain.</hi> What a glorious character is here given to <hi>Oneſiphorus?</hi> He was not perſecuted himſelf,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48709:139"/>
but he made himſelf a companion with thoſe that were. <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth of <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. <hi>That he had forſaken him, for he was now in hands,</hi> and to anſwer before <hi>Nero,</hi> who was known to be nothing but clay and blood mingled together, whoſe cruelty would extend to all abettors and well-wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. If any did but ſigh in his time, it was a capital crime. This fear made <hi>Demas,</hi> (as it did all his other friends, <hi>verſ. 16.) forſake Paul;</hi> they had not faith and courage enough to venture for him, and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>He did love the preſent world;</hi> he loved his life and liberty too much; though ſome think this was but a temptation in <hi>Demas,</hi> and that he did return to <hi>Paul</hi> again. By this we ſee, how hard a thing it is, to own thoſe that are godly in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. <hi>John</hi> 19. 38, 39. It is noted both of <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea,</hi> and of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> both Diſciples of Chriſt, but ſecretly for fear of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> yet when Chriſt was crucified, they ſhewed their boldneſſe and courage about Chriſts body, when he was dead. And <hi>Matth,</hi> 25. at that terrible day of Judgement, judicial proceſſe againſt ſinnes of omiſſion, will be for neglect in this, <hi>I was in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> When Chriſt and his cauſe are diſcountenanced in the world, then unleſſe a man have a ſincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart, he will curſe with <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſwear, That he knoweth not the men.</p>
               <p>Theſe things laid as a foundation, let us conſider, why ſuch ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <note place="margin">Reaſons why partaking with the Saints af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, doth intereſt us in their glory. 1. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates our faith in Chriſt to be upon ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual grounds.</note> with, and partaking of others afflictions, doth intereſt in eternal glory. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, This Reaſon is evident, <hi>Becauſe hereby we plainly demonſtrate, that our Faith in Chriſt, and acknowledging of him, is upon divine and ſpiritual grounds,</hi> that we do not know Chriſt, and the Chriſtian faith after the fleſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. This diſcovered the thorny ground not to be true and right ſoil, becauſe in time of temptation, when the ſcorching Sun did ariſe, then all the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fruit began to wither. This apoſtatizing from Chriſt in time of ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, is ſo great a matter, that we are conſtantly to pray for the grace and aſſiſtance of God therein, that we be not left to our ſelves. For <hi>Peter</hi> being forſaken in ſome meaſure only, how dreadfull was his fall? And for this end it is that God ſuffereth perſecutions and troubles to accompany the profeſſion of his truth, that ſo it may be known who are ſound, and who hypocrites. If thou art but chaff, this winnowing will drive thee away. They are but a very few that acknowledge Chriſt upon ſpiritual and enduring grounds. So that though the world rage, though enemies be furious and bloudy, yet they ſtand like Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that cannot be moved. Many become Chriſtians, as ſome did <hi>Jewes</hi> in <hi>Mardochees</hi> time for fear, and becauſe the State favoured the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Outward reſtraint maketh many take the title of Chriſtians, but they live the life of <hi>Heathens,</hi> becauſe the pleaſures of ſinne are preſent, and affect the ſenſe. <hi>Orant quia timent, peccant quia volunt,</hi> They pray and performe outward religious duties, becauſe they are afraid; but they ſinne, becauſe their will and pleaſure inclineth thereunto. Now theſe droſſie Chriſtians, when they are brought to the fire, they preſently melt away. It cannot be denied but that men may ſuffer much for a while at leaſt, and yet at laſt deny Chriſt, as we have ſad inſtances in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory; but many times ſuch, with that famous <hi>Cranmer,</hi> did prove the more couragious, and took an holy revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves. This accompanying <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his dangers, hath a notable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Luke 22. 28. Ye are they which have continued with me in my tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, therefore I appoint unto you a Kingdome, that ye may eat and drinke with me, and ſit on thrones judging Iſrael.</hi> Even as Chriſt manifeſted his pure love to us, that in the midſt of all the agonies and miſeries he grapled with from God and men, yet he did not give over our cauſe, but compleated our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us. If ſo be <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſo much favour <hi>Abiathar,</hi> though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:48709:140"/>
death, that he told him he would not put him to death, though guilty, becauſe he had been afflicted in all wherein his father was afflicted, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 26. How much more will Chriſt ſay thus to ſuch, who have not been driven from him by great afflictions?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such communion in afflictions muſt needs intereſt in glory, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is ſuffering for Chriſt.</hi> Thou that art a companion to ſuch as ſuffer, <note place="margin">2. Becauſe this is ſuffering for Chriſt.</note> thou doeſt ſuffer, partly in thy heart and affections, and partly expoſing thy ſelf to the rage of men, for owning ſuch. The approving, the pleading for, and refreſhing of thoſe that do ſuffer for Chriſt, proclaimeth to others, that thou art of the ſame way and perſwaſion, and that thou art ready to receive whatſoever load the world ſhall lay upon thee. So that it is not any defect in thy zeal, or in the adverſaries malice that maketh thee no ſufferer, but the meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, which reſtraineth theſe Lions that they do not devour thee, when they do others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction,</hi> how falſe and hypocritical a thing it is to forſake any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſons, while they are in danger for Gods work; eſpecially for people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil and draw back from their Paſtors and Guides, while valiant for the truth. In ſuch curnal and worldly fears, thou publiſheſt thy corrupt and hypocritical heart to all the world: Thou that doeſt not in thy place and calling ſtand by and encourage ſuch who ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake, thou betrayeſt Chriſt like a <hi>Judas</hi> for thirty pieces of ſilver. See what a ſad complaint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh of ſuch falſe and ſelf-ſeeking revolters, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 16, 17. At my first defence no man ſtood with me, but all men forſook me.</hi> Now leſt you ſhould think that it might be ſuch an infirmity of fear as might excuſe, he addeth, <hi>I pray God, it be not laid to their charge.</hi> The ſame petition <hi>Stephen</hi> (Act. 7.) uſeth about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors. Indeed concerning <hi>Alexander</hi> who ſo much withſtood him, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord reward him according to his work;</hi> becauſe he was a malicious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer; but theſe did withdraw out of infirmity; yet <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer argueth it to be a very dangerous thing ſo to do.</p>

                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 8.</bibl>
                  <q>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Aſia, that we are preſſed out of meaſure, above ſtrength, inſomuch that we deſpaired even of life.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WE are now arrived at the eighth verſe, which <hi>Piſcator</hi> maketh the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that <hi>Apologetical Narration,</hi> which we have <hi>Paul</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the following part of the Chapter againſt thoſe calumnies that were caſt upon him. The firſt whereof was his <hi>levity</hi> and <hi>inconſtancy.</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed to come to them, he did not, which the falſe teachers branded with mutability. Now it is thought that <hi>Paul</hi> inſtanceth in this great trouble he met with in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as the cauſe why he did not come, as he had promiſed. But I rather joyn with thoſe, that do make it part of the precedent Diſcourſe about afflictions and conſolations in them. So that what he had in the general only ſpoken of before, he now illuſtrateth in particular; becauſe (ſaith <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi> on the place, <hi>Sermones morales,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moral Diſcourſes are the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, by how much the more particular they are. Paul</hi> therefore having in the general aſſerted the bleſſed fruit and gracious iſſue of afflictions to ſuch as believe; he inſtanceth in himſelf, by an heavy affliction which did befall him, and of the wonderfull deliverance which God vouchſafed to him. He was like <hi>Jonah</hi> even in the whales belly, and yet God vouchſafed mercy and conſolation to him.</p>

them as <hi>brethren,</hi> ſo farre was he from affecting any tyrannical dominion over them, he joyneth a <hi>fraternal affection</hi> with a <hi>paternal office.</hi> But of this more in the laſt verſe. This Title alſo ſignifieth that love and Chriſtian communion, which is to be amongſt Paſtor and people; no contentions, no variance or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions are to be entertained.

                     </gap>n</hi> trouble, was of great uſe and well worthy to be known. The falſe Apoſtles they took occaſion from <hi>Pauls</hi> ſufferings to contemne him, and to bring him into diſgrace, as if he had been a turbulent and ſeditious perſon; but <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo farre from being aſhamed of his troubles, or deſirous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal them, that he rather deſireth to publiſh them, that all who fear God may know of them, as alſo Gods gracious dealing with him in the iſſue. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is of very great uſe to know what are the afflictions and troubles which do</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">'Tis of great uſe to know the afflictions of thoſe who ſuffer for Chriſts ſake.</note> 
                  <hi>befall the ſervants of God for his ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of the Saints ſufferings, what they have endured, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully God hath preſerved and comforted them, is of very great practical uſe. The people of God have a communion, not only in Church-duties, and Church-priviledges, but alſo in afflictions and ſufferings; and therefore if he as a man ſaid, <hi>Nihil humani à ſe alienum,</hi> we may ſay, <hi>Nihil Chriſtiani,</hi> &amp;c. No man is to account that as ſtrange, which he heareth any Chriſtian may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under. Thus <hi>Coloſ. 4. 7, 8, 9. Paul</hi> being in bonds for the Goſpel, doth on purpoſe ſend <hi>One ſimus</hi> and <hi>Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hicus</hi> to them, to declare his eſtate to them, and alſo to know how it ſtood with them, becauſe by ſuch mutual intercourſe, there is a mutual edification of one another.</p>
               <p>I ſhall briefly inſtance in ſome general great advantages that may be made, by our underſtanding of the afflictions and troubles, that are very heavy upon others. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby we ſhall be the more provoked to pray for them, to wreſtle with God in their behalf.</hi> It is good to conſider, how earneſtly <hi>Paul,</hi> though <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſons.</hi> 1. Hereby we ſhall be more provoked to pray for them.</note> ſo eminent and choice a man in holineſſe, doth deſire the prayers of others; and therefore when he had ſpoken of that confidence he had in God, who as he had, ſo alſo would for the future deliver him, he addeth, <hi>verſ. 11. You alſo helping together by prayer for us;</hi> as if none of thoſe great mercies <hi>Paul</hi> looked for could be brought forth, but by the help of their prayers. This then is that, which maketh the godly deſirous, that others who fear God, may know how it is with them, what temptations they lie under, what afflictions they grapple with, that ſo they may have the effectual fervent prayers of a righteous man, which availeth much. Though the prophane deride and ſcoffe, yet the prayer of any true godly man is greatly to be valued, and much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:48709:141"/>
Secondly, As ſuch are thereby provoked to pray to God for them; <hi>ſo when</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Hereby they will be more encouraged to bleſs God, when they are delivered.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſhall mercifully deliver them, and turn their afflictions for good, then they will alſo be encouraged to bleſſe and praiſe God alſo in their behalf, and thus more glory redoundeth ſtill to God.</hi> Thus alſo the Apoſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. declareth, <hi>That by the meanes of many perſons thankes may be given to God on our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</hi> Thus you ſee no Chriſtian is to live to himſelf, but it is his duty to be praying to God for others, and praiſing God in the behalf of others; but how little are the people of God exerciſed in theſe communion duties? How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle zealous in prayer for others, but farre more negligent in the praiſes of God for others? When doeſt thou bleſſe God for the mercies, deliverance vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to the afflicted Saints of God, as if they were thy own? This publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is greatly wanting in believers, who do not conſider they are of the body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>By knowing the afflictions of others, and their holy deportment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Hereby we may learn pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, zeal and heavenly mindedneſs, and other graces.</note> 
                  <hi>them, thou mayeſt thereby learne patience, zeal, heavenly mindedneſſe, and many other graces.</hi> Afflictions are Gods ſchools, and that whether on thy ſelf, or on others. How much patience may we learn by the afflictions upon <hi>Job?</hi> Thus <hi>James 5. 10, 11. The Prophets who ſpake in the name of the Lord muſt be taken as an example of ſuffering affliction, and of patience; and ye have heard of the patience of Job:</hi> How greatly did the waves of God paſſe over his head? No Martyr, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> amplifieth it, came near <hi>Job</hi> in all their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and therefore the holy Ghoſt thought fit to have the Hiſtory of <hi>Job</hi> recorded, that all might know and learn by it. Be not then a ſtranger to the ſufferings of Gods people, but inform thy ſelf about them, to imitate their graces, to be encouraged to do the like, when God ſhall call thee to fight his battels.</p>
               <p>But you may ſay, <hi>What uſe can be made from the preaching about ſuch affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> What uſe is to be made of preaching about ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which <hi>Paul</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſuffered from <hi>Heathens? Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>which</hi> Paul, <hi>and the other primitive Chriſtians ſuffered from</hi> Paganiſh <hi>and</hi> Heatheniſh <hi>enemies? We have no</hi> Neroes <hi>or</hi> Diocletians, <hi>neither are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to priſons and Martyrdome. To what purpoſe is it to preach of ſufferings to thoſe, who live in all quietneſſe and freedom? What uſe or good improvement can we make of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is neceſſary to anſwer this Objection. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>By the ſame reaſon you may ſay, To what purpoſe did the Spirit of God cauſe this Chapter to be written, with many other paſſages of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which treat of afflictions, and that from</hi> Pagans? Certainly, though we be not for the preſent exerciſed as they are, yet the record of this, the Doctrine about this is of very great concernment. Therefore</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Though thou art not called to be a Martyr, or to ſuffer from ſuch enemies, yet there is none that will live godly, but they ſhall meet with afflictions one way or other.</hi> We read of no child of God without his tribulations. None can come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they muſt firſt go thorow a wilderneſſe: They muſt firſt with Chriſt ſuffer, and ſo enter into glory. We told you, that there are afflictions of divers ſorts; There are real, and there are verbal afflictions. Though thou doeſt not ſuffer in thy life, and in thy liberty, yet thou mayeſt in thy name, and in thy outward comforts. There is no man, which liveth in a zealous, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner for God, and endeavouring to pull down the kingdom of Satan; but the Devil and his inſtruments will raiſe oppoſition enough againſt him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good to hear Sermons about ſufferings for Chriſt. For though thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles be not ſuch great and bloody ones, as the Martyrs have been, yet thou art to drink part of this bitter cup: The Lord he hath given thee a portion in theſe tribulations: and truly there is not the leaſt affliction befals us in the way of God, but if God did not preſerve us, and keep us by his grace, we ſhould ſinke under it. The frowhe of a man, the fear of a mock is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48709:142"/>
enough to diſcourage us from our duty, if God doth not corroborate us. If therefore the world doth not hate us, if that be not a profeſſed enemy to us, we may juſtly doubt, whether we be the Womans ſeed, or not rather the Serpents ſeed. Seeing therefore thou haſt thy tribulations more or leſſe, and that for righteouſneſſe, thou mayeſt improve this truth for thy edification.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>What though the Church of God meeteth not with perſecutions and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>troubles from Pagans and Heathens, yet thoſe it ſuffereth from ſuch who pretend to Chriſt, and judge it ſpecial ſervice of God ſo to afflict them, have a ſharper ſting in them.</hi> What miſeries and bloudy cruelties have not many godly <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from <hi>Papiſts?</hi> who yet glory that they only are zealous for Chriſt, that others are blaſphemers and enemies to Chriſt, and therefore ought to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch ſevere cenſures. Now may not ſuch Martyrs and ſufferers receive as much comfort, as if they had been perſecuted from <hi>Heathens?</hi> Yea doubtleſs; for in ſome reſpects their ſuffering is the greater, and their conſtancy the more admirable. When the holy Prophets were ſtoned to death by the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that yet thought themſelves to be the onely people of God, this did not diminiſh but aggravate their glory. The patience of <hi>Abel</hi> was more admirable in being ſlain by his brother <hi>Cain,</hi> then if it had been by a ſtranger. If therefore thy ſufferings ariſe from ſuch who highly pretend to the glory and truth of Chriſt: Be not deſpondent, for thy crown of glory will herein be greater, than if it had been from open adverſaries. Hence it is obſervable, how remarkably the Scripture ſpeaketh of thoſe who ſuffered by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> Rev. 13. 10. <hi>Here is the patience, and the faith of the Saints,</hi> which is again mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 12. A true Chriſtian ſuffering from falſe Chriſtians, hath not the promiſes of God obſcured or diminiſhed hereby to him, but rather enlarged; for God conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both from whom it is thou art troubled, and the cauſe why, and the manner how thou beareſt it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe truths about ſuffering for Chriſt are uſefull even to ſuch who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all freedom and abundance; becauſe there is a two-fold Martyrdom, Martyrium</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>cordis,</hi> and <hi>Martyrium corporis;</hi> a <hi>Martyrdome of the heart, and a Martyrdom of the body.</hi> If therefore thou art not called to ſuffer bodily, it is certain thou muſt ſuffer ſpiritually, <hi>Habes quod in te occidas;</hi> if others do not martyr thee, thou art to martyr thy ſelf. Hence is that duty, <hi>Of offering up our ſelves as a Sacrifice to God.</hi> Hence it is we are commanded, <hi>To deny our ſelves, to take up our croſſe, to pull out the right eye, to cut off the right hand;</hi> and the conſtant practice of Chriſtianity is, <hi>To mortifie the fleſh, to crucifie the fleſh.</hi> Inſomuch that the ancient Writers do frequently compare this ſoul-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to the bodily Martyrdom. He that doth abſtain from the ſeeming pleaſures and profies of ſlane, this man is a ſpiritual Martyr. He that doth cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie his will, that doth ſubdue and conquer his corruptions, it is as much from the grace of God, as he that is enabled to lay down his life for Chriſts ſake; all theſe come from the ſame principle. There is required an inſuperable divine and efficacious power of grace to bring the heart to any holy duty, to avoid any ſinne, from pure and holy motives. It is therefore of conſequence to hear of the conſolations which God giveth in ſufferings: for if thou haſt not corporal ſufferings, thou haſt ſpiritual ones, and therefore God he will propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thy comforts to thy exerciſes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is good to underſtand and poſſeſſe our ſouls with the afflictions of others, that hereby we may acknowledge the mercy of God to us, if he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>give us Sun-ſhine dayes, when others have lived in trouble ſome times.</hi> Say not then, What are theſe Sermons of ſuffering to us, who are not exerciſed? for they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern thee, ſeeing that hereby thy heart is to be raiſed up to more thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to more joy in bleſſing and praiſing of God. Is it not a mercy that thou didſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48709:142"/>
not live in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes; That thou art not one of thoſe mentioned by the Apoſtle, <hi>Who wandered in ſheepskins and goatskins, who had no ſetled aboad or quietneſſe in any place.</hi> They did eat their bread with trembling, and drink with fear and aſtoniſhment, flying from one place to another, parents bereaved of children, husbands of wives. Now when thou ſhalt conſider, what ſad times many of the people of God have lived in, and thou haſt daies of peace and abundance, Is not this like fire in thy boſome to inflame thee with the love of God, and conſtantly to bleſſe him?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is good to know the ſufferings of others, though thou art freed,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe none knoweth when the time of thy trial may come.</hi> The times of the Churches peace, and of her troubles are in Gods hands, and theſe times are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to himſelf; Thou knoweſt not what heavy ſufferings thou mayeſt be put upon ere thou dieſt, and therefore it is good to be providing the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Chriſt, before the day of fighting doth approach. The Mariner hath not his inſtruments to provide in the midſt of the ſtorm, but he doth prepare for it: ſo neither is the ſouldier then to furniſh himſelf with weapons, when the enemy is approaching to him. Do thou therefore hear much, know much, and be inſtructed much about the patience and ſufferings of the Saints, that when God ſhall call thee to it, it may not ſeem a ſtrange, and a new thing to thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction,</hi> not to be afraid to hear of, and know all the difficulties and calamities which will accompany the powerfull way of owning Chriſt. How carnal and ſelf-ſeeking are our hearts, with the Diſciples to flee from Chriſt, when he is carried to the Croſſe? We would receive good from Chriſt, but not evil; whereas if thou doeſt conſider it, thou ſhalt find the earthly and the worldly man is more afflicted and troubled in getting the things of the world, then thou in obtaining of Heaven; and what a ſhame is it, that they ſhall be more patient and enduring for theſe worldly goods, then thou art for heavenly? Doth not the earthly man ſay to his gold, what ſhall ſeparate us from the love of it? Doth he not ſay, for the love of thee I am killed all the day long? This is the golden Image that every one fals down and worſhips. Oh then ſhame thy ſelf, ſaying, How much can theſe ſuffer? How much can theſe bear, and for that which will damn them at laſt? But my carnal, fearfull heart is afraid to ſuffer for Chriſt, who will give me eternal glory. Shall the Devil have his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, the world its ſufferers, and ſhall not Chriſt have ſuch as will leave all to have all by him again?</p>

For <hi>afflictions</hi> are ſo many arrows delivered out of Gods quiver, which are ſure to hit the mark they are deſtined unto. Here is no more difficulty in the words; only Expoſitors queſtion, What this trouble was, he met with in <hi>Aſia?</hi> Where may we find any thing about the particulars of it? <hi>Cajetan</hi> on the place acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, That concerning this trouble in <hi>Aſia,</hi> he could read nothing in any Book that was authentick; yet it ſeemeth not to referre generally to all the troubles he met with in publiſhing of the Goſpel, but to ſome eminent ſingular one; and therefore he ſaith, the <hi>trouble,</hi> not <hi>troubles</hi> in the plural number. Some learned men therefore referre this to thoſe paſſages mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 9. where he ſaid, <hi>A great door and effectual was opened to him at Epheſus,</hi> (that was in <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe) <hi>but there were many adverſaries;</hi> and theſe no doubt did endeavour to bring him into much danger. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32. he is ſaid there, <hi>To fight with beaſts at Epheſus;</hi> whether he underſtand beaſts truly and properly, or metaphorically, men as wild and as ſavage as beaſts, all ſheweth the extream danger he was in. It may ſeem probable, that the Apoſtle related to this: only it is objected, That the trouble here mentioned was but lately done, and ſuch as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48709:143"/>
not yet heard of. Therefore the general current of moſt Interpreters, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Apoſtle meaneth that danger he was in, mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 19. by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and others, when the whole City of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was in an uproar, becauſe of the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> concerning which they ſo vehemently accuſed <hi>Paul;</hi> for there we read was a popular ſedition, and the City was in a great confuſion, <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his company were in a mad rage againſt <hi>Paul.</hi> So that although <hi>Luke</hi> doth not in particular mention the extream and grievous danger <hi>Paul</hi> was in, yet it may well be concluded from the general. Thus <hi>Calvin,</hi> and many others. So that this foundation being laid, and this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the trouble. We may obſerve,</p>

               <p>That this Doctrine may be the better conceived, let us take notice, What was the cauſe that brought this trouble upon <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and we ſhall there ſee, how the ſame cauſes do ſtill make men mad, and bitter enemies againſt the wayes of God. The Hiſtory we have related, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. from <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. to the end of the Chapter: it is there declared, That <hi>no ſmall ſtirre did ariſe about that way,</hi> that is, the <hi>Evangelical way,</hi> the <hi>Gospel way</hi> preached by <hi>Paul.</hi> The occaſion whereof was by one <hi>Demetrius a ſilver-ſmith, which made-ſilver ſhrines for Diana,</hi> that is, little Images, made for the worſhip of <hi>Diana,</hi> which was a trade of very great profit and advantage to him and others of the like craft; therefore he conſults with them, and uſeth two arguments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That <hi>their craft would be in danger.</hi> The trade they lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would fall to the ground. And this certainly was that which did moſt prevail with him; and by this we ſee, how hard a matter it is to part with a profeſſion or way of life, though never ſo ſinfull, if it be a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way. The matter of profit will be like duſt in our eyes to hinder our ſight; it is ready to put out all ſpiritual diſcerning in the conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil, juſt and unjuſt. So that we are greatly to ſuſpect our hearts in thoſe things, that are matter of profit to us, leſt they deceive us therein.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is religious: Though his heart be carnal, yet <hi>he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Sanctuary of Religion.</hi> The former Argument was too groſſe, if it had been alone; and therefore he maketh Religion the greateſt, <hi>The great Goddeſſe Diana ſhall be despiſed;</hi> her magnificence deſtroyed. Now this he maketh a very hainous ſinne, becauſe all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the world worſhipped her. Thus you ſee multitude, univerſality, and the cuſtome of others, that is the great reaſon he hath to perſwade for the worſhipping of <hi>Diana,</hi> which is the ſame argument that carnal and ſuperſtitious people do ſtill poſſeſſe their ſouls with.</p>
               <p>So that from this hiſtorical paſſage, you ſee the Doctrine genuinely deduced, <hi>That men who regard Religion no further, than they have carnal advantages, are like ſo many Toads full of poiſon, full of rage againſt ſuch as do faithfully preach the Gospel.</hi> Therefore in this very Chapter, we have a notable inſtance of the work of Gods grace upon ſome who believed, for they brought their
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48709:144"/>
Books of curious Arts, which had been gainfull and profitable to them, and burnt them before all men, though the price of them was found to be fifty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſilver; They mattered not their gain, nor their profit, they would part with all, now they had received the Goſpel in the power of it. We have a parallel Hiſtory with this of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Act. 16. 19. where there was a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Damſel, that had a ſpirit of divination, which brought her Maſters much gain by ſoothſaying; but <hi>Paul</hi> adjureth and diſpoſſeſſeth that ſpirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is ſaid, <hi>When her Maſters ſaw that the hope of their gain was gone; They took Paul and Silas, and carried them to the Rulers, laying great crimes to their charge.</hi> Thus if we do ſearch to the true ground of all that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice which the Chief-prieſts vented againſt Chriſt, never ceaſing till they had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him; although they pretended Religion, and becauſe he ſpake blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and did break the Sabbath, yet the real cauſe was, becauſe he diſcovered their hypocriſie and covetouſneſſe, manifeſting that they ſought only great things for themſelves. This alſo <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth upon his enemies, the falſe Apoſtles, who did create ſo much trouble and grief to him, <hi>That they were enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, and did mind earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. Thus alſo <hi>Gal. 6. 12. They made a ſhew in the fleſh, that they might not ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we come more more particularly to enlarge this. And <note place="margin">Two ſorts which oppoſe the truth and wayes of Chriſt. 1. Such as take the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be blaſphemy and idolatry, or ſuperſtition the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, You may take notice, <hi>That there are two ſorts of perſons who do with much violence and despite oppoſe the holy truths, and wayes of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such who may have ſuch an abſolute blindneſſe and meer errour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their mind, that they take the true Religion to be blasphemy and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reproach to God; and on the other ſide, they take Idolatry and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the onely true ſervice of God,</hi> and therefore that they cannot do more acceptable ſervice unto God, then to oppoſe that way of Religion, which yet indeed is only approved of by God. Of ſuch our Saviour ſpake to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>John 16. 2. Whoſoever killeth you, will think that he doth God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi> and of this number was <hi>Paul,</hi> who profeſſeth that he once thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound to ſet againſt the Name of <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> Act. 26. 9. Here we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> ſo convinced in his judgement, that if he did not with all his power and might oppoſe the way of Chriſt, he thought, it would have been his great ſinne. And thus no doubt it may be the caſe of many deluded Hereticks and Papiſts; ſo that they ſhall be perſwaded there cannot be more acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable work unto God, then that they ſhould impriſon and deſtroy thoſe that do yet truly fear God. This ignorance upon them, though it may excuſe in ſome degree, and make them leſſe ſinners, then ſuch who do wilfully oppoſe, and do deſpite maliciouſly againſt the Spirit of grace, yet it doth not totally free them; nay they are perſecutours for all that; as you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged concerning himſelf. Now ſuch enemies as theſe are acted by religious principles, but in a falſe way; they commonly are more zealous and implacable than any other. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe it was not any carnal advantage or profit he ſought after, but a meer zeal for the Religion he had by tradition from his fathers, therefore did he purſue the Chriſtians in ſuch a bloody furious manner. <hi>Tantum Religio potuit,</hi> &amp;c. ſaid the Poet: Oppoſitions againſt the wayes of God from ſuch who are zealous and devout in their falſe wayes, are conſtantly more dreadfull and terrible than any others. So that we are again and again to try what ſpirit we are of, to examine, Whether it be the true Religion indeed that we give our ſelves up to the profeſſion thereof. For if it be not, the greater zeal, the greater forwardneſſe therein, is but the greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and like the Traveller out of the way, the more thou runneſt,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48709:144"/>
the further thou goeſt from the true way. But</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of enemies to the truths of Chriſt, which are farre the <note place="margin">2. Such who profeſſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, meerly becauſe it ſuits with their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſts.</note> more numerous part, is of ſuch, <hi>Who are addicted to ſuch a way and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in Religion, not becauſe of any Divine worke of Gods Spirit upon them, but becauſe it ſuiteth with their carnal intereſt, it agreeth with their external profit;</hi> and therefore they cry out, <hi>Great is Diana,</hi> when indeed in their heart they ſay, Great is their wealth, great is their gain; this is the <hi>Diana.</hi> We may juſtly charge this upon Popery. What was it that made <hi>Luther,</hi> and the other Reformers ſo odious to the Popiſh party? What made the Pope with his adherents, to breath nothing but fire and ſword? Was it not becauſe they touched the Popes Crowne, and the Monkes belly? Hence</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel meet with oppoſition, not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hence the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel are not only oppoſed to thoſe who are without, but by ſome within the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>from the Pagans only that are without, but from the ſonnes of the Church, which are within;</hi> from thoſe who profeſſe the ſame God, the ſame faith, the ſame Chriſt with them. And the reaſon is, becauſe many that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt, do ſo for earthly and carnal reſpects; and ſuch titular and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Chriſtians as theſe, cannot but hate thoſe that are genuine. The Apoſtle in the large Catalogue of his manifold ſufferings, reckoneth this up amongſt the reſt, <hi>Perils from falſe brethren,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 26. Thus in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family, there will be an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to perſecute <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe one is of the bond-woman; and the other of the free. Think not then, that the <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Jew,</hi> will become enemies to the powerfull preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for every falſe Chriſtian will. Every one that followeth Chriſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe of loaves, or with <hi>Judas,</hi> becometh a Diſciple, becauſe of the bagge. Doth not experience confirme this, that the prophane Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth as bitterly rage at, and oppoſe the holy wayes of Chriſt, as any <hi>Heathen</hi> would doe? Thus the godly Miniſters have trouble (as it were) from their own flock, their Sheep ſometimes becomes Wolves and Beares to them; and with <hi>Ezekiel, They dwell among Scorpions,</hi> Ezekiel 2. 6. <note place="margin">Who are they which profeſs Religion meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for carnal ends. 1. Such as live in their luſts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The carnal intereſt and earthy ſinfull respects, are of divers ſorts;</hi> even as the creeping things that are produced from the earth are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He knoweth Religion onely for carnal ends, though it be the true one, that turns the grace of God into wantonneſſe; That cryes up Gospel truths one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to encourage themſelves in a licentious way.</hi> As many of the mixed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude went out with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet kept their old and corrupt natures ſtill; So in the firſt Reformation many came out of <hi>Rome</hi> with the bleſſed Reformers; many gloried in the name of <hi>Evangelici,</hi> that they had ſhaken off the yoke of <hi>Antichriſtianiſme;</hi> but at the ſame time, they did not caſt off the yoke of ſinne. The firſt Reformers ſadly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of ſuch, that looked upon the Goſpel, as the caſting off not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Popes Laws, but Gods Law alſo; as if to renounce the Images and Maſſe had been enough, though in the mean time they did ſecurely ſleep in all wickedneſſe. Now from ſuch as theſe, the Miniſters of the Goſpel have found as much unkindneſſe and malice, as from their Popiſh adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: So that both ot home and abroad, the Prophets of the Lord have been greatly afflicted. Theſe ſpots in our feaſts; theſe lovers of pleaſures more than God; theſe are they that have in all places withſtood the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and life of godlineſſe, the holy Order and Diſcipline Chriſt hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted; as if the liberty <hi>Paul</hi> bids us ſtand faſt in, were a liberty to ſinne without controll, and an indulgence in all licentiouſneſſe. Such as theſe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48709:145"/>
when they come into the warme Sunne, when they have Summer, an opportunity in their hand will diſcover that they are Serpents, and will ſting. <hi>Tertullian</hi> apologized of old, That the Chriſtian Religion had her greateſt enemies in Ale-houſes and Brothel-houſes; and thus ſtill the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull way of godlineſſe is oppoſed by thoſe monſters in Chriſtianity, that have the head of a Chriſtian, but the heart and life of beaſts; <hi>Mulier for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa ſupernè deſinit in piſcem;</hi> Like thoſe <hi>Locuſts,</hi> Revel. 9. 6. that had <hi>faces like men, but teeth like Lions, and tailes like Scorpions.</hi> Thus how many have the face of Chriſtians, but in heart, in lives are beaſts all over? From theſe the Miniſters of God have received much oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They know Religion onely after carnal respects, who intend to enrich and</hi>

Our Saviour knowing ſuch a ſelf-ſeeking diſpoſition was predominant in many, who proffered to be his Diſciples, he therefore prevents their Hypocriſie and Apoſtaſie, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, <hi>The Foxes have holes, but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head;</hi> and requireth it as a fundamental qualification, <hi>That he who would be his Diſciple, muſt loue Chriſt more than father and mother, and life it ſelf:</hi> Yea muſt not <hi>venture to winne the whole world,</hi> if thereby <hi>he ſhould loſe his ſoul.</hi> Oh take heed of this <hi>Judas,</hi> this treacherous diſpoſition in thee, to be of the mind with thoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, who ſuppoſed, <hi>That gain is Godlineſſe,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 5.

Well, ſuch as theſe are, will in caſe of profit and advantage, make all oppoſition againſt the preaching of the Goſpel, when they cannot have <hi>Chriſt</hi> and their <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> any longer, when their <hi>Dagon</hi> and <hi>Ark</hi> will conſiſt no longer together, then you ſhall ſee all that poiſon vomited at the mouth, which before lay cloſe up in the heart; then they will deſire no Miniſtry, no Goſpel, rather than be deprived of their gain.</p>

               <p>THe word of God purely preached, with the faithfull Miniſters thereof, meet with no greater oppoſition in the world, then from ſuch who regard Religion, no further than it maketh for their carnal intereſts.</p>
               <p>This truth hath been in part opened; and becauſe every Chriſtian unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, doth upon ſome falſe and carnal motive or other, take up the profeſſion <note place="margin">More chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of ſuch who profeſſe Religion only upon worldly reſpects. 1. Such who in time of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations prove adverſaries to the Goſpel and Miniſtry of it.</note> of Chriſt, whereby when he is put to the denial of that earthly reſpect, he can then no longer hold, but breaketh out in oppoſition to the pure wayes of Chriſt. Therefore it is very uſefull to give further <hi>Characters</hi> of ſuch who regard Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion only upon inferiour and worldly reſpects. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Such are led with corrupt respects, and in time of temptation will prove adverſaries to the Miniſters of the Gospel, who are not of a ready and prepared ſpirit, to take up the Croſſe, and to follow Chriſt in whatſoever condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſhall command; ſuch who are Chriſts Diſciples onely in the Summer time, while there are Halcyon dayes and times of plenty and encouragement to be a Chriſtian.</hi> Theſe when they are urged to part with all, to ſuffer, and to be undone for Chriſt, then they turn into any thing; they will oppoſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that way, which once they did imbrace and admire; yea they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perſecutours of ſuch inſtruments of Gods glory, which once they did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and all this ariſeth from the earthly and carnal heart, which made them at firſt look to Gods wayes, <hi>Phil. 3. 18. Paul</hi> did with <hi>tears,</hi> and even <hi>weeping,</hi> ſpeak of ſuch, <hi>Who were enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, who minded earthly things.</hi> So that by <hi>Pauls</hi> example, we ſee it is a thing to be bitterly monrned about, when we ſee men hopefully profeſſing the true way of Chriſt; and then when adverſity and perſecution doth ariſe, they preſently can change, and turn their faith again; They can withſtand and contradict what once they pleaded for, and all becauſe they are reſolved to ſave themſelves: They think <hi>Gain is godlineſſe.</hi> Such an one as this, is an object greatly to be pitied, and mourned over; he loveth his eaſe, his liberty, his advantages more than Chriſt, and ſo is no wayes fit to be his Diſciple. And for this reaſon it is our Saviour doth ſo oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten plainly, and in Parables urge all, to conſider upon what termes they take up the profeſſion of his name; he foretelleth them of all the hardſhip and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they muſt encounter with, that ſo they may not prove enemies at laſt, who in the beginning ſeem'd to be friends. Wonder not then to ſee this fall out oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the Chriſtian Church, that thoſe who were once friends, and went with us
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48709:146"/>
unto the houſe of God, afterwards to become like ſo many <hi>Hazaels</hi> to thoſe who fear God. Alas, their earthly advantage, and the preſent world, hath made them change their opinions and affections: They never at firſt did own Chriſt upon ſincere and pure motives, and therefore not being able to ſuffer for Chriſt, they ſet againſt him; and this alwayes falleth out, that he who is an Apoſtate from the true profeſſion of Chriſt, doth become a cruel and bloudy enemy of that way he once walked in. <hi>Omnis Apostata est oſor ſui ordinis,</hi> All Apoſtate perſons, whether in Doctrine or Practice, are implacable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to truth and holineſſe. This hath been experimentally proved in all ages; and one reaſon is, becauſe hereby they would be revenged upon thoſe from whom they have departed; for their guilty conſcience telleth them, they have juſtly incurred the cenſure of the godly; They have loſt their repute and eſteem, their good name is blaſted; and this maketh them ſtudy all oppoſition and malignity that may be. Look then to thy motives at firſt, to thoſe termes thou didſt profeſſe Chriſt at the beginning; if it was any humane or falſe motive, if it was not ſuch an entire and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring principle, that will not make thee ſtand upon a Rock immovable; Let any winds or tempeſts ariſe, as great a friend, and as forward a well-wiſher, as now thou ſeemeſt to be for good things. Had we a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall diſcerning, we might with the Prophet look ſtedfaſtly upon thee, as he did on <hi>Hazael,</hi> and weep to think what enmity and miſchief thou mayeſt create to ſuch as fear God. This man taketh up the old Rule, <hi>Ama tanquam oſurus;</hi> He loveth this way of Chriſt, ſo as thinking his outward advantages may ſometimes or other make him hate it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such regard Religion only in a carnal way, <hi>Who though they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Such as maintain do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which overthrow the foundation of Religion.</note> 
                  <hi>may acknowledge ſome principles of the Christian Religion, yet at the ſame time maintain ſome damnable or heretical Doctrines that doe overthrow the very foundation.</hi> Such as theſe take up Religion with carnal motives, and ſo in time become cruel enemies to the faithfull Guides, that are in Gods Church. Wonder not that I make an Heretick to regard Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after the fleſh; for <hi>Galat. 5. 20. Hereſies</hi> are reckoned a <hi>fruit of the fleſh.</hi> Inſomuch that <hi>Austin</hi> made it an ingredient into the definition of an Heretick, that he either beget or propagate falſe opinions, <hi>Alicujus temporalis commodi causâ,</hi> for ſome <hi>temporal advantage.</hi> And although we cannot ſay thus of all, becauſe God in juſt judgement doth deliver up ſome who receive not the truth in the love of it, to efficacy of errour, to ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11. yet this very deluſion upon their judgement, this errour and blindneſs upon their mind, is of the fleſh. For you muſt know, that the fleſh, or to be carnal, doth not in the Scripture ſignifie the pollution upon the ſenſitive and bodily part only, but alſo upon the intellectual and rational: It's a fleſhly mind, as well as fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections. Thus all ſuch, who though they do retain ſome principles of the Chriſtian faith, doe yet believe other damnable Doctrines, theſe are Religions only in a carnal reſpect; and thereupon when occaſion ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, do manifeſt the rancour and malice that is in their heart againſt the truths of Chriſt. Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory informeth us, of the bloody cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which the <hi>Arrians</hi> exerciſed againſt the Orthodox, when they had power in their hands. The <hi>Paganiſh</hi> perſecutions were not much ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Heretical. Yea, as it is ſaid, amongſt brethren diſcord is the more vehement and flaming than any other: So it is amongſt thoſe that pretend to be of the ſame Church of God. So that we ought to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to pray earneſtly unto God, to keep our hearts, to enlighten our minds, to give us tenderneſs and lowlineſs of mind, that we be not led aſide
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48709:146"/>
with the errour of the wicked; for errour and hereſie will break out into enmity, and make men think they do God good ſervice, while they deſtroy you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then we regard Religion after a carnal manner, <hi>When we make</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Such as make parties and factions in the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>parties in it, when we promote factions and diviſions, and ſuch as do ſo are filled with much ſpite and malice againſt thoſe that are contrary to them.</hi> This is a ſinne the members of the Church are prone to, and nothing inclineth more to oppoſitions and contentions, then ſuch a frame upon mens ſpirits. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh very clearly to this, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 3. Whereas there is among you envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrife; one is for Paul, another for Apollo, are ye not carnal?</hi> And <hi>verſ. 4. Again, are ye not carnal?</hi> So that this doth plainly diſcover men not to be led by divine and holy principles, who are apt to foment differences, who are ready to ſet up one Miniſter againſt another; to admire the gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of one to the contempt of others. This was the great ſinne of theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> that as they diſcovered much pride and ambition in the names which they gave perſons, <hi>(Capellus</hi> Hiſtor. <hi>A. M.</hi> 3168.) ſometimes delighting in words, which ſignified power and principality, as <hi>Hegemon,</hi> &amp;c. Or ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted victory, as <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> &amp;c. Or ſuch as declared glory, as <hi>Polycletus,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ſuch a carnal ambition did ſtill remain in them, though made Chriſtians, ſetting up and admiring mens perſons, looking after gifts which brought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe more than grace and ſanctification. Now thoſe that are thus carnally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, they do continually throw balls of fire into the Church, and make it a <hi>Babylon</hi> in ſtead of a <hi>Jeruſalem. Jude</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>verſ. 16. Of having mens perſons in admiration, becauſe of advantage.</hi> It is ſome carnal advantage or other that maketh them advance this and that man againſt others. What the iſſue of ſuch diviſionsis, appeareth <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16. viz. <hi>To bring in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and every evil work.</hi> As alſo he ſheweth the nature and cauſe of this, <hi>It is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh,</hi> though men may judge it zeal, and think they are active for Gods glory, yet it's ſenſual, and cometh from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and it is good to obſerve how largely the Apoſtle expatiateth about the ſinfulneſſe of the <hi>tongue, That a world of evil is in it;</hi> and from that exhortation, <hi>Be not many Maſters;</hi> that is, do not take upon you to be Teachers, and ſo to reprove and cenſure others in a carnal and ſinfull way. It is this that maketh not only the <hi>tongue,</hi> but the <hi>pen</hi> alſo to be full of gall and wormwood; it maketh the pen to be an unruly evil, that none can tame. Take we heed then of minding Religion onely to make parties, and different wayes therein; for this will at laſt break into an open enmity againſt the truely godly.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then we look after Religion in a carnal way, <hi>When we make uſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Such who make uſe of the Doctrine of the Goſpel only to ſhew their parts and learning.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Doctrine thereof onely to ſhew our parts or learning; when we earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend about it, as it is our opinion, not as it is Gods truth.</hi> For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Apoſtle doth ſo frequently exhort <hi>Timothy, To take heed of disputes, and vain janglings,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 6. where the end of the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is ſaid to be <hi>Charity out of a pure heart, and a good conſcience, with faith unfeigned; but from theſe ſome did ſwerve, by turning aſide unto vaine jangling.</hi> Here you ſee, that thoſe who have not pure and unfeigned hearts in the things of God, they fall into vain diſputes and quarrels. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 4. it is called, <hi>Doting about queſtions and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, railings, and evil ſurmiſes:</hi> And he addeth their character, <hi>Suppoſing that gain is godlineſſe.</hi> Here you ſee, that in all theſe diſputes and controverſies there is no pure heart, no good conſcience, all is to advantage themſelves by it: yea if this be not diſcovered in any ſordid or worldly manner, yet if thy pride, the loftineſs of thy ſpirit be hereby advanced, and thou doeſt not mind Religion, to exerciſe thy ſelf to godlineſſe, but to have men admire thy gifts, and to wonder at
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48709:147"/>
thy abilities: Thy heart is a corrupt heart, and thou wilt manifeſt thy enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt the wayes of Chriſt, when oppoſed therein. Thy wit, thy parts, thy applauſe, thou mayeſt make thy great <hi>Diana,</hi> and oppoſe all that would deſtroy this Goddeſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That we may conclude all, and leave nothing out, <hi>Whoſoever doth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Such as do not own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon divine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and holy motives.</note> 
                  <hi>not own the Chriſtian faith from divine principles, and holy pure motives, this man is but a titular, and a falſe Chriſtian, and ſo cannot, but when occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerveth manifeſt his oppoſition to Chriſts wayes.</hi> And therefore it is, that as amongſt the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> there was an irreconcilable diviſion between <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and a great oppoſition between <hi>Davids</hi> houſe and <hi>Sauls;</hi> though all pretending to the onely true God: So it is in the Church of God, though there may be an agreement in the ſame Doctrine, in the ſame Profeſſion of faith; come to the ſame Ordinances together, yet becauſe one hath not a ſupernatural life of grace within, hath no experimental feeling of the power of ſanctification upon his ſoul; hence it is that he hath a ſpirit of antipathy and contrariety to thoſe who are indeed born of God, and walk in wayes of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. So that we may conclude, Whoſoever is not regenerated, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Religion no further than carnal and earthly reſpects, let his pretences be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo high and plauſible. And therefore there is no unconverted man, though he hath never ſo high an Office, never ſo great repute in the Church of God, but he ſerveth Chriſt for loaves; ſome inſincere and inſufficient motive or other worketh upon him; he hath his ſhrines that he liveth by. And therefore as it was with that rich man, who boaſted, <hi>He had kept all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the youth,</hi> when he was tryed in one inſtance, where his heart was greatly affected, <hi>viz. To part with all, and follow Chriſt,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He went away exceeding ſorrowfull.</hi> Thus when any ſuch empty, nominal Chriſtians are put upon ſuch duties and wayes, which are contrary to their luſts, they will go away, not it may be exceedingly grieved, but greatly enraged and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This will be like the jealouſie-water, to diſcover the adultereſſe. To pull out their right eyes, and to cut off their right hands, will be like the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> to diſcover what they are. And the ground of this whole truth is from the exceeding great purity and exactneſſe that is in the word of God truly preached, it cometh to new mould, and change the whole man, <hi>All old things muſt paſſe away.</hi> This will not abide either a corrupt mind, or a carnal heart; and therefore one being contrary to the other, as light to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and fire to water. No wonder if then the hypocrite be unmasked, and the carnal heart diſcovered. The Goſpel either conquers men, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them friends, or elſe leaveth them more provoked enemies; but the fault is not in the Goſpel preached, neither are faithfull Miniſters the troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but thy whoredoms, thy idolatries, thy luſts are the cauſe of all this combate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Instruction,</hi> what all godly Miniſters, and private Chriſtians, who are zealous againſt ſinne muſt look for, not from <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> but falſe carnal Chriſtians, that regard no Religion any further then their luſts or advantages may be kept up. Will thoſe that live by the ſinnes of people, ever be willing to have ſinne deſtroyed? Do not many as <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſay, If this way of Religion go on, we ſhall not be able to live any longer? And therefore they flie with open mouth againſt all holy order, and good diſcipline againſt ſinne. But know thou that all thy prophaneneſſe and diſſoluteneſſe doth not ſo much provoke God, as thy oppoſition of the Goſpel, and the Miniſters thereof. Yea we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> uſing a divine imprecation againſt ſuch in this caſe, which neither Chriſt or <hi>Stephen</hi> ever uſed againſt thoſe that did put them to death, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 14. Alexander the copper-ſmith did me much evil.</hi> And afterwards he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth wherein, <hi>He hath greatly withſtood our words, or preachings.</hi> It was not
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48709:147"/>
any perſonal, or temporal evil that moved <hi>Paul,</hi> but the withſtanding of his preaching; whereupon he poureth out this prayer, <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him accoeding to his worke.</hi> Oh dreadfull and terrible impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially coming from one acted by the Spirit of God in delivering of it!</p>

To exhort us ſeriouſly and impartially to examine our ſelves about our motives and grounds, which make us to take up the title of Chriſtianity.</hi> Is it for fear, or becauſe of cuſtome, the Laws of the Land require it? Doeſt thou not find the divine power of holy truths upon thy ſoul? Then know thy Religion is like thy life, a bubble, a vapour that will quickly go out: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are the more diligently to obſerve our hearts, when we have any profit or preferment, when we have any external accomodations by our profeſſion. Oh how hard is it then to diſcern between true and counterfeit, whether it be the truth of God, the love of God, or thy own intereſt that prevaileth with thee, when thy enemies and adverſaries ſhall charge thee with it!

For ſuch an expreſſion he meaneth not ſo much the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the words; as when the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>The world would not contain all the books that might be written about Chriſts deeds;</hi> but thereby to repreſent to the Reader ſome further degree, then ordinarily is in other things. But the Apoſtle doth not here ſpeak of a verbal <hi>hyperbole,</hi> but a real one, that which was above expreſſion. The Apoſtle uſeth this expreſſion, when he ſpeaketh of the riches of Gods grace and power to believers, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 14. Epheſ. 2. 7. Eph.</hi> 1. 19. No ordinary expreſſion will ſerve <hi>Paul,</hi> when he cometh to ſpeak of the admirable, and wonderfull riches of Gods grace, to thoſe that do believe in him.

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>By the expreſſion then in the Text we ſee, That this trouble the Apoſtle was exerciſed with, was no little inferiour trouble, but that which was of the moſt preſſing nature that could be, that was out of meaſure heavy and burdenſome.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>How doth this agree with that which we have</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter of this Epiſtle, where he calleth all the afflictions that do befall the godly,</hi> light, Our light affliction, <hi>verſ. 17. Can it be light, and yes out of meaſure heavy alſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be anſwered and reconciled thus, It is called <hi>light</hi> in reſpect of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <note place="margin">How the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the godly may be called <hi>heavy,</hi> and yet <hi>light.</hi>
                  </note> glory. So that although it be exceeding heavy and preſſing in it ſelf, yet if compared with the <hi>weight of glory</hi> hereafter, ſo it is <hi>light.</hi> Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be anſwered, By diſtinguiſhing of the times, when <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his affliction <hi>heavy,</hi> it relateth to the time, that he was exerciſed with it. For Chriſtianity doth not require <hi>Stoiciſm,</hi> yea patience is the more admirable, by how much the more apprehenſive we are of the trouble upon us. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 12. 11. No chaſtiſement is joyous for the preſent, but grievous.</hi> Or,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may ſpeak of afflictions when they are over, when we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from them, and find the great good they have done to us, then we may call them <hi>light,</hi> and judge them nothing to the benefit we received by them. But</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, I conceive that the moſt genuine anſwer is, That <hi>Paul</hi> doth here ſpeak of his trouble according to the ſenſe and apprehenſion of his fleſh; even as afterwards he ſaith, <hi>It was above his ſtrength,</hi> that is, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, natural ſtrength, as will appear afterwards. If therefore fleſh and blood be conſulted with, then <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is an affliction above meaſure;</hi> but then at <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. of the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. as alſo in other places, he ſpeaketh according to the workings of faith, and the operations of Gods Spirit within him. So that a godly man ſpeaketh one thing according to the fleſh, and another thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Spirit. That is bitter and heavy to the fleſh, which may be ſweet <note place="margin">Godly men judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of their afflictions from ſenſe and fleſh, then from grace and reaſon.</note> and welcome to the Spirit. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That godly men judge otherwiſe of their afflictions by the principles of ſenſe and fleſh in them, then they do by the principles of grace and reaſon in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:48709:148"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it, <hi>An affliction above meaſure,</hi> in the lower ſphere of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but again he calleth it, <hi>A light one,</hi> in the higher ſphere of grace. Even as an Aſtronomer, beholding the Sunne with his bodily eye, judgeth it leſſe than the Earth; but then again, beholding it with the inſtruments of Art, doth conclude, that it is many degrees bigger than the Earth. Thus the godly man, while he thinketh and ſpeaketh according to the law of the fleſh within him, he cryeth out of his burdens, he is diſcontented at them, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at them as deſtructive: but then again, when the ſame man conſidereth them by the principles of faith, and Scripture-grounds, then he ſeeth that thoſe ſtones may be turned into bread; and from theſe thorns he may gather grapes. Even as we ſee in Chriſt, becauſe he had two diſtinct Natures in a perſonal Union; therefore we ſay, Chriſt died, Chriſt was in agonies, and that becauſe of his humane Nature; yea it is called, <hi>The blood of God.</hi> And again on the other ſide, Chriſt is ſaid to be God, to create the world, to raiſe himſelf from the dead, and that becauſe of his Divine Nature. As he was <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> ſo he was full of power and might upon the earth; As he was the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> ſo he was ſubject to weakneſſe and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now here was no impoſſibility or repugnancy, that it ſhould be thus different with Chriſt under ſeveral reſpects. Thus alſo it is with every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt; As he is born of God, ſo he puts forth divine and gracious operations; but as he doth ſtill retain ſome reliques of his old birth: So there are ſinfull and infirm actions coming from him. Therefore when a godly man doth any thing, we muſt conſider from what fountain it is, either the ſweet fountain, or the bitter fountain that it ſloweth from.</p>
               <p>To diſcover this truth: <note place="margin">Propoſitions clearing the truth. There are two ſelves in every regenerate man.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt know, <hi>That in every regenerate man, there are two ſelfes, (as it were) the carnal ſelf, and the ſpiritual ſelf;</hi> From which iſſue all the works we do, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 17. and alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. For although <hi>Amyraldus. Expoſ. in cap. 7. ad Rom.</hi> (yet profeſſing both againſt <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians)</hi> doth induſtriouſly labour to underſtand it of a man only legally wrought upon, and that it would be a diſhonour to <hi>Paul,</hi> and injurious to the work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to affirm, That <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh thoſe things in his own perſon while regenerated: yet by that Text in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 5. 17. it is plain, That thoſe who are godly like <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> have theſe two twins ſtruggling in their womb; and that as a man conſiſting of ſoul and body, we may ſay, he is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and immortal, viſible and inviſible; in different reſpects mortal and viſible, in reſpect of his body; but immortal and inviſible, in reſpect of his ſoul. Thus alſo it is with a godly man in a theological conſideration; he hath both corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and grace, he hath both fleſh and ſpirit. Now although this be ſo, yet a godly man is not to be called an unregenerate perſon, as well as a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; a ſinner and a wicked perſon, as well as holy: Becauſe denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are alwayes from the more noble part; and this corruption, though remaining, yet is to be ſubdued and conquered. Even as <hi>Canaan</hi> might be called the poſſeſſion and inheritance of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> although many <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſites</hi> did ſtill continue therein, and could not be caſt out. Let not then any godly man look for ſuch perfection in this life, as to have only one principle within him, and that of grace. Do not look that it ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as the Spirit will have it in thee, not finding the leaſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or renitency from the fleſh: No, this eſtate is to be enjoyed onely in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As theſe two ſelfes, or principles are in a man that is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Theſe two ſelfs oppoſe one another.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo they doe actually oppoſe and contradict one another.</hi> Hence cometh that Chriſtian combate and conflict which the godly find within themſelves.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48709:149"/>
Not like that of the Heathens, <hi>Aristotles</hi> incontinent perſon, or the Poets <hi>Medea,</hi> a conflict between reaſon, and their luſts only. But this oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is univerſal and diffuſive in every part of the ſoul. The carnal part in the mind oppoſeth the ſpiritual. The carnal part of the will contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpiritual. So that they have heart againſt heart, affections againſt affections. We are not therefore to conceive of theſe two principles, as dormant and latitant in the ſoul, but they are as fire and water in the ſame ſubject, labouring to expell each other; and according to the three-fold eſtate or degree, that we may conceive in perſons regenerate, ſo is this fight and congreſs more or leſſe vehement.</p>
               <p>The firſt degree is of ſuch who are newly converted. Theſe although in Regeneration, they have the ſeed and root of all grace, yet becauſe of their former cuſtom in evil wayes cannot ſo immediately conquer and ſubdue their luſts; and therefore like children that begin to walk, becauſe of their feebleneſs they get many fals.</p>
               <p>A ſecond degree is of thoſe, who are in ſome meaſure proficients, and have obtained much victory over ſinne. And although in ſuch there be many combates, yet grace hath the poſſeſſion of the whole man, notwithſtanding the many aſſaults made againſt it. And then</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There are ſuch, whom the Scripture calls <hi>perfect,</hi> not <hi>abſolutely;</hi> but <hi>comparatively</hi> to others, becauſe they are as Gyants, when others are but Dwarfs; theſe are ſaid, <hi>To have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil.</hi> Now ſuch, although they do overcome the world, and the Devil by faith, yet they are not free from this combate within. It is true, ſome think, that though it be granted that <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. ſpeaketh in the perſon of a regenerate man, yet it is of one in the loweſt forme, that is but newly come into the ſtate of Chriſtianity. And <hi>Amyraldus</hi> doth therefore think <hi>Paul</hi> cannot mean thoſe things of himſelf, becauſe he had attained to an higher degree of grace: Inſomuch that he inviteth others to follow him, and to take him for an example. Hence he is ſaid to know nothing by himſelf: Whereby the ſame Authour concludeth, That there would be no blame or fault to be found with that man, who ſhould ſay, <hi>Paul had as much grace here in this life, as ſome ſhall have in the world to come.</hi> But although we grant <hi>Paul</hi> to be among other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, like <hi>Saul</hi> among other men, higher by the ſhoulders, yet that he did find the rebellion and corruption of the fleſh debaſing his beſt duties, appeareth by his <hi>accounting all things droſſe, and deſiring to be found in the righteouſneſſe of Christ,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. So that while theſe endeavour to exalt the ſanctifying grace of God in <hi>Paul,</hi> they eclipſe his juſtifying; and while they advance his inherent righteouſneſſe, they obſcure his imputed righteouſneſſe. Whether <hi>Paul</hi> then, or any other eminent ſervant of God, <hi>They all find a law of ſinne within them, rebelling againſt the law of the mind;</hi> by which they look upon themſelves as miſerable captives, and do groan for a perfect and full redemption by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe two principles therefore not onely reſiding in them, but act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Hence 'tis good to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from which of thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceed.</note> 
                  <hi>contrarily, it is very neceſſary in a Chriſtian, exactly to obſerve, to what mother (as it were) the child doth belong.</hi> To which principle thou art to attribute thy actions. For the not duly dividing and ſeparating here, doth many times cauſe great confuſion in the godly ſoul. We ſee it many times in <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> that there are ſuch different expreſſions, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of faith and joy, and then again of diffidence and dejection, that we would not think the <hi>Pſalme</hi> was made by the ſame man; we would think there were contradictions, and all, becauſe ſometimes it is the voice of <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſometimes the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> (as I may ſo ſay;) Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

grace ſpeaketh, and ſometimes the filth ſpeaketh. In the Diſciples al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo our Saviour taketh notice of this, and thereby excuſeth them, ſaying, <hi>The Spirit is willing,</hi> Matth. 26. 41. Now although it is very neceſſary in all our practicals to go to the bottome, to know what is of the fleſh, and what is of the Spirit; yet in the matter of afflictions, and our bearing of them, there we are much more to attend to it. For afflictions being grievous to fleſh and blood, draweth out the corruptions thereof very much. So that the voice of the fleſh is many times farre louder than the voice of the Spirit, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the godly ready to conclude, that they are nothing but fleſh, that they have not the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in them, becauſe they feel ſo much diſtruſt, ſo much diffidence and diſquietneſs of heart within them.</p>
               <p>More uſefull particulars are to be inſiſted upon; only for the preſent, let thoſe who truly fear God, make this Uſe of the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Not to conclude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their eſtate, as if it were wholly carnal, becauſe they feel the ſtruglings and motions of ſinfull fleſh within them; let them not deſpair, if they feel that they cannot alwayes keep up ſpiritual apprehenſions about their afflictions; if they cannot ſay, I bleſs God for theſe chaſtiſements, I ſee the great advantage cometh to me by them. Though they appear like anger, yet they are indeed the effects of love. If this be not alwayes the bleſſed and ſerene diſpoſition of thy ſoul, but thy fleſh like <hi>Job</hi>'s wife provoketh thee <hi>to charge God fooliſhly,</hi> to be impatient and diffident; remember that you have a two-fold ſelf, a carnal ſelf, and a ſpiritual ſelf; one ſaith one thing, and another ſaith another thing.

                  <note place="margin">How we may know when faith, and when fleſh ſpeaketh in our afflictions. 1. Fleſh argues from afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God hath forſaken us.</note> 
                  <hi>to know things that differ.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The voice of fleſh and blood in ſuch kind of troubles, is to make a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concluſion and ſentence upon our ſelves, That God hath forſaken us, that we are caſt out from his love.</hi> Inſomuch that did not the principle of grace in ſome meaſure withſtand, and at ſome times overcome theſe temptations, the ſoul would be ſwallowed up in this whirlpool: but let the godly know, that this is not the voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but of <hi>Eſau.</hi> The regenerate principle will not, dare not give in ſuch falſe teſtimony, <hi>Iſai. 49. 14, 15. Zion hath ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.</hi> But in the next verſe we ſee God expreſly denying it, and that not only, he had not forſaken her, but that he <hi>could not forſake her,</hi> for his affections were more to her, then any mothers to her ſucking child. The Church then was too haſty and precipitate, ſhe ſhould have conſidered Gods Word, before ſhe paſſed ſuch a peremptory ſentence concerning her ſelf. Therefore when God ſaith one thing, and thy heart another; when the Scripture ſpeaketh one thing, and thy fleſh another thing, which is more to be regarded? See this diſtemper likewiſe in <hi>Jonah,</hi> Chap. 2. 6. <hi>Then I ſaid, I am caſt out of thy ſight.</hi> Here the corrupt part in <hi>Jonah,</hi> made quick his deſperate work, <hi>He was caſt out of Gods ſight,</hi> but <hi>Nubecula fuit, cito tranſivit;</hi> it was a little ſtorm, it was preſently over; for immediately he doth (as it were) contradict himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>I will look again toward thy holy Temple.</hi> So that it was with corruption and grace at this time, as it was with <hi>Rebeccah</hi> in her child-bearing; the firſt came out <hi>red and hairy,</hi> but the ſecond came out <hi>ſmooth, and holding Eſau by the heel.</hi> Thus the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jonah</hi>'s heart cometh forth red and hairy, bloody and rough; but then faith like <hi>Jacob</hi> followeth this <hi>Eſau</hi> immediately, and ſupplants it. When therefore the godly do at any time find ſuch motions, and workings of heart, as if their troubles were a demonſtration of Gods deſertion of them, that if he loved them, he would never let it be ſo with them, rebuke theſe immediately, and be as much affected as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was, when he heard <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> blaſpheme God. For indeed ſuch thoughts do highly diſhonour God, and repreſent him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than he is. For the Apoſtle directed by the Spirit of God, which ſearcheth the deep things of God, ſpeaketh far otherwiſe, making theſe troubles to be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his love, and that if he did not deal thus with us, we might then conclude, we did not belong to him. <hi>Heb. 12. 6, 7, 8. If ye be without chastening, ye are bastards, and no children, for whom he loveth he chasteneth.</hi> It behoveth thee to make this difference in thy ſelf, elſe thy deſtruction will come upon thee ſuddenly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The voice of fleſh and blood alſo ſpeaketh after this manner in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Fleſh ſaith, afflictions will undo us.</note> 
                  <hi>heavy troubles, That they will unto thee, that there can never come any good out of this to thy ſelf; that it would have been farre better for ſoul and body, if the Lords hand had not been in this manner upon thee.</hi> Here alſo that falſe and corrupt principle is a liar within thee. For <hi>David,</hi> who at ſometimes is apt enough to be caſt down, and exceedingly troubled, yet upon his recoveries can ſay, <hi>Out of very faithfulneſſe thou haſt afflicted me; and before I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted I went astray,</hi> Pſal. 119. 75, 67. Thou ſhouldeſt therefore do as the Apoſtle in another caſe, making objections againſt Gods diſpenſations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5. ſaith, <hi>Is God unrighteous?</hi> And then correcteth his ſpeech, <hi>I ſpeak as a man.</hi> Thus art thou alſo bound in all the unſavoury workings and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thy ſoul, to rebuke thy ſelf, ſaying, I think now as a man, I ſpeak as a corrupt ſinfull man. Yea <hi>David,</hi> getting ſome power againſt theſe ſinfull motions within him, abhorreth himſelf in an higher degree, <hi>Pſalm 73. 22.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48709:150"/>
would perſwade thee, that there can never any good come to thee out of the preſent evil upon thee, that God cannot create light out of this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For as <hi>Adam</hi> was undone by hearkning to <hi>Eve,</hi> and yeelding to her temptation: Thus fleſh is like an <hi>Eve</hi> within thee, that will betray and deſtroy all at laſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Fleſh and blood under theſe heavy troubles, doth alſo ſpeak ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Fleſh ſaith, our afflictions will never end</note> 
                  <hi>about the Perpetuity of them; as if after ſuch a black night, there would never ariſe a fair day.</hi> This froward and peeviſh corruption within thee, ſaith, <hi>It will never be otherwiſe.</hi> Thus it ſpake in <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the houſe of Saul.</hi> Yea in ſeveral <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the Church complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>As if God had caſt off for ever, and that he would remember her no more.</hi> Thus the corrupt principle lieth continually in thy boſome, not like a <hi>Dalilah,</hi> enticing and deceiving, but like a thorn in thy ſide daily vexing and tormenting of thee. <hi>David</hi> being experimentally exerciſed, both in the ſenſe of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo in the ſenſe of grace, we find him ſometimes ſpeaking this voice within him, <hi>Pſal. 31. 22. I ſaid in my haſte, I am cut off from thine eyes. Pſal. 94. 18. When I ſaid, my foot ſlippeth, thy mercy, O Lord, held me up. Pſal. 116. 11. I ſaid in my haſte all men are liars.</hi> By theſe inſtances we ſee, what an haſty principle a man hath within him under troubles. For, who can expect to have a better heart than <hi>David,</hi> that was after Gods own heart? and yet we hear him often complaining, that <hi>in his haſte</hi> he was ready to ſpeak ſuch and ſuch things, eſpecially that there would never come any help to him, and that the Prophets of God were but liars, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him with vain hopes. But the voice of Gods Spirit ſpeaketh farre otherwiſe, in a more calm and ſweet manner. As it was in the viſion to <hi>Elijah,</hi> God was not in the fire, nor in the tempeſt, but in the <hi>ſtill voice:</hi> So commonly grace is not ſeen in thoſe haſty, boiſterous, impetuous thoughts, but in a more ſerene and calm way. Now (I ſay) if we ſit ſtill, and hear what God ſpeaketh to his people in ſuch great preſſures, it is the clean contrary, <hi>Iſa. 54. 7. As it were for a little moment have I forſaken, but with everlasting kindneſſe will I have mercy on thee.</hi> We ſee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practice of <hi>Harbakkuk</hi> likewiſe notably to this purpoſe, <hi>Habak.</hi> 2. 1, 3. Becauſe God did delay, he would ſtand upon the Tower, and watch to ſee what God would ſay to him. Thus do thou in thy expectations of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The principle of fleſh and blood doth notoriouſly preſſe to do any</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Fleſh would put us upon any means to get out of trouble.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinfull action, neglect any duty, ſo that we may come out of ſuch troubles.</hi> And this affection or ſenſe within a man hath a moſt immediate oppoſition to the work of grace within him. It is with the fleſh in this caſe, as it was with <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>Master</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſave thy ſelf;</hi> But with what indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation did Chriſt rebuke him, ſaying, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan?</hi> Mat. 16. 23. <hi>for thou ſavoureſt not the things of God, but of man.</hi> Such a <hi>Peter,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Satan</hi> is the fleſh to thee, that ſaith, <hi>Save thy ſelf,</hi> do any thing to eſcape theſe troubles: It is not any matter for righteouſneſs or holineſs, but look to thy ſafety. When theſe whiſperings are within thy heart, then riſe up in an holy zeal againſt them: Say, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan;</hi> This is not to ſavour the things of God. Had <hi>David</hi> been filled with ſuch holy zeal, as he was ſometimes, againſt his wife <hi>Michol,</hi> deſpiſing him for his adoration of God, then he had not uſed ſo many unlawfull ſhifts as he did to eſcape danger; his counterfeiting himſelf mad, his pretending to joyn with <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and to fight againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Theſe were ſad ſnares that he fell into, becauſe he did not ask counſel of the Lord, but conſulted only with fleſh and blood. Do thou then in thy troubles, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his extraordinary Call, <hi>Obeying immediately the heavenly viſion, and not conſulting with fleſh and blood.</hi> In thy troubles
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48709:151"/>
wait on God, take his way, put not forth thy hand to any ſinne: Say, it is better to have miſery upon thee, then the guilt of ſinne. It was <hi>Abrahams</hi> defect of faith, though he was the <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi> and though his faith ſtaggered not in the trial about offering up of his ſonne, yet in a farre more inferiour, and leſs temptation, there he began to reel out of the way, and from carnal fear did uſe ſinfull equivocation to <hi>Abimeleoh,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Sarah was his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> when ſhe was his wife. This unlawfull ſhift he uſed to prevent thoſe things he feared. But as <hi>Jonah</hi> could obſerve by his own experience, <hi>Jon.</hi> 3. 8. So it will always prove true, Thoſe that obſerve lying vanities, forſake their own mercies; when we take not Gods way, we forſake that mercy we might have had, and ſo make ous ſelves miſerable for fear of miſery. <hi>Raynardus</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite, (Lib. de Mart. part. 1. cap.</hi> 21.) reckoning up ſeveral kinds of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> that may be called ſo in a large, and an improper ſenſe, doth out of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and more profuſely out of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſhew, That thoſe Chriſtians who lay in great pains, and extream diſeaſes, and yet would not uſe ſuch ſuperſtitious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical remedies that happily might have healed them, but would die rather than take any one of theſe medicines, highly commending their faith and patience, were accounted Martyrs; he is <hi>Martyr in lecto,</hi> who dieth of his pain, and his diſeaſe rather than he will uſe magical helps to be cured. It ſeemeth in the dayes of thoſe Fathers, there was that wicked practice, which is now alſo too much uſed by many ungodly wretches, by going to Wiſemen and Wizards, in their diſeaſes, and to make uſe of their ſuperſtitious remedies to cure them. But as the zeal of theſe Ancients did burn like fire againſt ſuch unjuſtifiable wayes, ſo do they highly commend the patience and mortification of ſuch, who would rather die than be healed in this manner, making it in ſome ſenſe an holy Martyrdom. I bring this, not only to put them to confuſion who are guilty of ſuch ſinnes, but to confirm the truth I intended, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever fleſh and blood doth ſuggeſt, yet faith and grace will make a man go through any troubles, rather than do that which is unlawfull, to come out of trouble.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The fleſh within a man doth only attend to what is troubleſom and grievous, yea aggravateth and heightens every thing, as if there were no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Fleſh only attends to what is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and grievous in afflictions.</note> 
                  <hi>no Christ, no grace, or promiſe from God to relie upon.</hi> So that this corrupt principle maketh them like thoſe, who by continual and ſtedfaſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the water, have their apprehenſions diſturbed, ſo that they know not where they are. It's fleſh and blood in <hi>Paul,</hi> that maketh him put this <hi>hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole</hi> upon the trouble he was in. For although no doubt, it was in it ſelf very great, and more than ordinary, yet <hi>Paul</hi> at another time ſaith, <hi>I know how to abound, and how to want; I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 12, 13. Here you ſee he accounteth nothing too great for him, nothing above his ſtrength. Again at another time in this Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 10. he is not afraid to ſay, <hi>When he is weak, then he is ſtrong.</hi> So that corrupt fleſh is apt to make a man look only at that which is grievous and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; it maketh a man attend only to the dark and diſpleaſing part in the affliction; whereas faith would ſhew us the clear and comfortable part alſo. The fleſh doth with us, as the Devil with poſſeſſed perſons, he kept the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack alwayes in the Tombs and Monuments about ſad objects. Thus that corrupt part in a man, detaineth us about thoſe things which are ſad and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: And as a man looking upon any thing through water, it ſeemeth as big again, as it would out of water: So every thing to the ſadded and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſpirit appeareth double or treble to what it is, whereas faith would make us lay all things together; lay the good and the bad together; regard the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as well as the thiſtles. And thus much may ſuffice about the tongue of the fleſh ſpeaking in a godly man, while he is under burdens, which like that tongue
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48709:151"/>
the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Is an unruly evil,</hi> Chap. 3. 6, 7. <hi>ſet on fire of hell, full of deadly poiſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us conſider, why it is ſo uſefull for a godly man, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Why a man ſhould ſo much ſtudy to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fleſh and ſpirit within him. 1. Becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he will be apt to paſſe a falſe ſentence upon himſelf.</note> to ſtudy and know himſelf, that he may be able to diſcern between <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> within him. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, If he do not make this diſtinction, <hi>He will quickly paſſe a falſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation upon himſelf, Becauſe he finds the fleſh ſpeaketh within him after that diſquieting manner, he will conclude that he is nothing but fleſh.</hi> It is from want of ſpiritual diſcerning herein, that ſo many tender hearts are diſcouraged and hopeleſs under their troubles. For they ſay, If the Spirit of Chriſt did work and breath in them, how could there be ſuch carnal froward and impetuous riſings of heart? Now all this is, becauſe they give both ears (like an unwiſe Judge) to one party, and do not keep one for the other alſo, to ſee what that can ſay; hear what the groans and deſires of grace ſpeak, as well as the ſinfull motions of the fleſh within thee. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. when he had largely diſcovered this combate of fleſh, and the Law of the mind within him, yet doth never give the fleſh the total predominancy over him; he maketh it but a part, and the inferiour part, <hi>I know that in me,</hi> verſ. 18. <hi>dwelleth no good;</hi> but leſt this ſhould be thought his whole ſelf, he telleth us what he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by <hi>that me,</hi> even <hi>my fleſh,</hi> and concludeth the Chapter, <hi>So then with the mend I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with the fleſh the Law of ſinne.</hi> Let the godly ſoul then in all its exerciſes, acknowledge this diſtinction: Do not ſay, thy whole ſelf is carnal, becauſe part is: Say not all the field is weeds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome are in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Hereby we ſhall be able to prevent the end and drift of Satan,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Hereby he may prevent the Devils end in troubling us.</note> 
                  <hi>who is ſo buſie in theſe troubled waters.</hi> For what would he work out of all theſe confuſions in thy ſoul, but to preſſe thee to deſpair, to judge thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hopeleſs? Why ſhould I wait upon the Lord any longer? To ſay as <hi>Cain, My ſinnes are greater than I can bear;</hi> and he indeed doth hotly purſue it, ſaying, Are not ſuch thoughts in thee? Do not ſuch motions work in thee? Canſt thou deny thy heart to be as it is? Now the godly ſoul anſwereth, I cannot deny but ſuch foul ſtirrings of heart are within me: But I deny the conſequence, that therefore I am all over carnal: I diſtinguiſh between that which is ſpiritual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and compleatly, and that which is gradual, and in ſome meaſure only. It is true, I find the workings of ſinne, but I alſo find the workings of grace. Therefore avoid <hi>Satan, though thou mayeſt bruiſe my heel,</hi> yet in time, <hi>I ſhall break thy head.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Act. 2. 22. Rom.</hi> 15. 19. Sometimes the word is applied to <hi>Angels,</hi> becauſe of their great ſtrength and power, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5. we have an expreſſion of <hi>the powers of the world to come,</hi> which ſome are ſaid, <hi>to have taſted of;</hi> but what that is, is greatly controverted.</p>
               <p>As to our purpoſe, we may take notice from the Scripture of a two-fold <hi>power:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>power of God,</hi> which is put forth in us by his grace, which we receive and partake of; and ſo in that ſenſe may be called our power, <hi>viz.</hi> objectively; yea and in ſome ſenſe ſubjectively, though not efficiently, <hi>Epheſ. 3. 20. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his power which worketh in us.</hi> Again ſaith <hi>Paul, I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is our own <hi>humane and natural ſtrength,</hi> what we can do by our
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48709:152"/>
ſelves only. Now the Queſtion is, Whether <hi>Paul</hi> mean that this affliction was above even his <hi>divine ſtrength,</hi> or that meaſure of grace and power which God had given him. So that if the Lord had not come in with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſupply, and more than wonted grace, this trouble had overcome him? Or whether he mean only of his <hi>natural ſtrength and power?</hi> So that his meaning ſhould be; as a man he could not bear it, though as a Chriſtian he did. It is very probable, that both theſe are included. So that neither the <hi>natural ſtrength Paul</hi> had, nor that <hi>divine ſtrength</hi> which uſually he enjoyed, could have carried him through that difficulty.</p>
               <p>Now to this expreſſion which <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth in the Text, we have another place in <hi>Paul,</hi> which ſeemeth directly, and in expreſs words to contradict this; it is 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. There hath no temptation taken you, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to man; but God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able,</hi> &amp;c. There <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, God will not let his people be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted above what they are able. And here <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh the contrary, He is troubled above what he is able: How can this be reconciled? Some untie this knot from the difference between <hi>temptation</hi> and <hi>affliction;</hi> There is no <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi> (ſay they) befalleth the godly above what they are able; but there may ſome trouble and affliction. For it is a temptation, when it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us into ſinne, and maketh us to offend God. Therefore we pray, <hi>God would not lead us into temptation;</hi> but it may be an <hi>affliction,</hi> even when it is ſo farre from being a <hi>temptation,</hi> that we do thereby more exerciſe and put forth our graces. Thus (ſay they) it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> It was an <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction above his ſtrength,</hi> but not a <hi>temptation</hi> above his ſtrength. For at that time <hi>Paul</hi> kept up his graces, his faith and patience were made more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, as file getteth off ruſt. I cannot ſay this is ſolid enough.</p>
               <p>For the Text therefore, though Expoſitors go ſeveral wayes, yet I ſhall pitch on this as moſt probable.</p>
               <p>The former part of the verſe, is a reaſon of that good exhortation, and neceſſary to every one, which he had given before, <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall:</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe there hath no temptation as yet taken hold of you, but ſuch as all men are capable of.</hi> An <hi>humane tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that is, little, ſhort and attemperated to mans ſtrength, or what is uſual amongſt men; <hi>As the rod of a man:</hi> And <hi>Iſa. 8. 1. The pen of a man. Rom. 6. 19. I ſpeak after the manner of men, ye have not yet been afflicted for Christianity. Nero</hi> hath not yet commanded the <hi>Christians</hi> to be vexed and tormented for the faith you profeſſe: Like that expreſſion, <hi>Heb. 12. 4. Ye have not yet reſiſted to blood.</hi> So that they had juſt cauſe to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to be afraid of falling, becauſe God had not put them yet upon any hard tryals for Chriſts ſake. What they hitherto ſuffered was ſuch as other men, though not Chriſtians, did endure as well as they. But leſt this ſhould deject too much, as if the time were coming, when their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould make them <hi>Apostates,</hi> he giveth them this wine to comfort their hearts with. This gracious promiſe which every Chriſtian ſhould call his promiſe, a continual <hi>Antidote,</hi> a daily <hi>Cordial, God is faithfull,</hi> &amp;c. where every thing ingredient to it, is of admirable comfort, <hi>God is faithfull.</hi> It belongs to the faithfulneſs of God to preſerve you, he hath taken you for his, and therefore his diſhonour would be more than thy loſſe, if thou ſhouldſt periſh. No husbandman will lay a greater burden upon his beaſt, than he can bear: Shall man be pitifull to beaſts, and not God a gracious Father to his children? The Artificer or Refiner likewiſe, he will not ſuffer his gold to lie longer in the fire, than the droſſe will be purged away; and ſhall not God ſo faithfull regard his children under their burdens? Again, <hi>He will not ſuffer you to be tempted.</hi> No Devil, no wicked man in the world can
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48709:153"/>
go further than God ſuffereth: <hi>Further, Not above that ye are able]</hi> He knoweth your ſtrength, he knoweth what will hurt you; he knoweth the time when he muſt take off the affliction: Therefore the iſſue will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, <hi>He will give to eſcape,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Some make it a Metaphor from the ſouldier, who eſcapes out of the warre with victory and conqueſt. Others from one, who is ſhut in, in ſome place, ſo that he is compaſſed about, but at laſt finds a way to get out: Yea the iſſue is not only to eſcape, but God will ſo plentifully come in upon us as that we ſhall <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, more than ſuffer, more than bear. As a ſtrong man that is not only able to carry his burden to ſuch a place he is commanded, but further alſo, if need require. Thus the godly have no more laid upon them than they can <hi>bear,</hi> by this promiſe; yea they can <hi>more than bear it,</hi> how then was <hi>Paul</hi>'s above his ſtrength? The Anſwer is, That this promiſe is to be underſtood of the <hi>final iſſue</hi> of any affliction, though for the preſent they may ſeem even to ſink under it: They cry out, they cannot hold, they cannot bear any longer, yet God doth ſecretly ſupport, and at laſt will give them ſtrength, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>bear,</hi> but <hi>more than bear,</hi> even to glory and rejoyce in it. And thus it was with <hi>Paul;</hi> this trouble, though ſo exceedingly preſting, though for the preſent above his ſtrength; yet ſee how much ſtrength he feeleth at the latter end. This trouble did not overcome him, but he overcame by the trouble by the grace of God. For by this he was brought not to truſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but in God, who did deliver him; and thereupon he concludeth, he doth and will deliver him. So that God never ſuffereth any trouble, though it be for the preſent never ſo heavy and burdenſom, totally and finally to overcome a man, but at laſt he proveth even more than a conquerour. Theſe things thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it's not the natural ſtrength of any man, no not of</hi> Paul, <hi>that is able</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is not the natural ſtrength of any man that can carry him through all afflictions.</note> 
                  <hi>to carry a man through ſuch afflictions, that God may exerciſe him with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith here, <hi>It was above his ſtrength;</hi> not to complain, not to accuſe God, as if he were too ſevere; but thereby to debaſe himſelf, and to give all glory to God. Thus <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. 28, 29. when the Church began even to deſpair under her long calamities, ſaying, <hi>Her way was hid from God, he took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her condition.</hi> With what incouragement doth God ſpeak, and that from this property in him? <hi>The Creator of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary.</hi> God ſinketh not under the government of the world, nor the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church. For if the Sunne that hath runne its courſe ſo many years, is not weary, but can perform it as ſwiftly as ever: Do we think God will be weary? But this is not all the comfort. As he hath this power, ſo he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth it to his weak people. To them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength. So that the more ſenſible we are of our own impotency, the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is God to put forth his power.</p>
               <p>To explain this, Let us conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the ſenſe of the Doctrine is, <hi>That no man can bear any burden</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. No man can bear all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions aright in his own ſtrength.</note> 
                  <hi>of affliction in a gracious manner without divine aſſistance from Chriſt.</hi> Men may be naturally patient under great troubles; yea they may have that forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as to be able to deſpiſe death it ſelf; but all this is not done in a godly way. There is not the leaſt temptation or affliction that cometh upon thee, but if God ſhould leave thee to thy ſelf, thou wouldſt be broken under it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſinne and corruption would manifeſt it ſelf therein. <hi>Peters</hi> caſe is abundantly known, a temptation did befall him, that was more than he could bear for the preſent, though he had a good iſſue out of it. Now this was a very little one in it ſelf; <hi>Peter</hi> had not yet <hi>reſisted to blood;</hi> It was but a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48709:153"/>
and ſome others that told him he was of Chriſts company. Here was no arraigning of him, no impleading of him: Here is no ſentence of death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him, and yet for all that he falls under it, and in a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner denieth Chriſt. What will any one ſay here, <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>preſſed above meaſure?</hi> No: but from hence we may gather, That there is not the leaſt, or moſt inconſiderable trouble that is, but falling upon thee in thy own ſtrength, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> with his hair cut off, but it is able to overwhelme thee. Therefore in all thy exerciſes, conſider thy infirmity: Know that to bear the leaſt burden as a Chriſtian, thou canſt not do it, unleſſe it be given thee from above. For if <hi>(Iohn</hi> 15.) <hi>We are not able to do any good,</hi> ſeparated from Chriſt; if we cannot performe any holy action without the help of grace, then much leſſe are we able to bear any affliction graciouſly. Conclude then on this, That ſo great is thy ſinfull infirmity and impotency, that thou canſt no more in a godly manner bear thy burden, then the <hi>lame Cripple</hi> could riſe up, <hi>and take his bed, and walke,</hi> till Chriſt bid him, and gave him power to do it.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>All thoſe opinions, which hold, That a man is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. All opinion's that hold the contrary, are injurious to the glory of God.</note> 
                  <hi>able to reſist the tentations of ſinne, whether by prosperity or adverſity, ſo that they be not very extream and grievous, without grace and ſtrength from Chriſt, are very injurious to the glory of God, though never ſo much coloured with ſpecious distinctions.</hi> A man cannot do the leaſt good, or beare the leaſt evil without Gods power, in an holy manner: And (beſides many Texts in Scripture) the reaſon is plain, Becauſe the power of man, and ſupernatural objects have no proportion or habitude between them. <hi>Ordo Naturae,</hi> and <hi>Ordo Gratiae,</hi> differ as much as Heaven and Earth. For this reaſon the people of God are ſo earneſtly to pray to God, that <hi>they be not lead into temptation.</hi> For let what temptation ſoever ariſe, if God leaveth thee to thy ſelf, it will be to thy ruine.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the third place, Experience doth confirm it, <hi>That many men</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. There is a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt a natural and ſpiritual bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of troubles</note> 
                  <hi>through the natural ſtrength they have, are able to beare up themſelves under extream troubles.</hi> Therefore we muſt acknowledge a vaſt difference between a <hi>Natural bearing,</hi> and a <hi>Spiritual bearing of troubles:</hi> And it is the duty for every one to examine, whether <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Grace</hi> doth ſupport. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. it is there ſaid of <hi>Abraham, That againſt hope, he believed in hope;</hi> againſt <hi>natural hope,</hi> he believed in <hi>divine and ſupernatural hope.</hi> Thus the godly they do above ſtrength with ſtrength endure afflictions, above natural ſtrength, with divine.</p>
               <p>But becauſe many men naturally have patient diſpoſitions; others ſtout and ſtrong ſtomacks, it is good to know, whether Nature or Grace ſupport thee. When <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov. 18. 14. The ſpirit of a man will ſustain his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear!</hi> He doth by that give us a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of two ſorts of <hi>troubles,</hi> The former <hi>External,</hi> ſuch as fall upon our Body, Eſtate, or good Name. And now under theſe, many a man hath ſo much natural courage and boldneſſe, that he will not ſhrink under them. But then</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort is <hi>Internal,</hi> becauſe of the guilt of ſinnes, when the wrath of God falleth upon the conſcience being now awakened and made tender; this he calleth a <hi>wounded ſpirit;</hi> and concerning this he ſaith, <hi>None can bear it.</hi> So that although for outward troubles, many men do with their natural power and ſtrength go through them, yet a <hi>troubled conſcience no humane power is able to bear,</hi> if God withdraw his helping hand. <hi>Cain</hi> cried out, <hi>It was greater than he could bear. Iudas</hi> was ſo overwhelmed with it, that he deſtroyed his own ſelf. Oh then take heed of bringing a burden upon thy conſcience, that is heavier than any weight! Poverty may be borne,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48709:154"/>
miſery and ſtreights may be borne, <hi>but a wounded conſcience, who can beare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth place, There is not only a great difference between the natural <note place="margin">4. There is a difference likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt moral and ſpiritual bearing of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> ſpirit of a man to bear infirmities and a gracious, but alſo that <hi>moral vertue</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fortitude</hi> by Philoſophers, which is ſo commended by them. They make <hi>Fortitude</hi> as a <hi>vertue, to lie in attempting difficult things, or bearing great evils for vertues ſake.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> boaſt of many ſuch virtuous perſons amongſt them, and for patient enduring of bitter torments, what expreſſions do the <hi>Stoicks</hi> delight in? They make all Philoſophy to be in theſe two words <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Suſtine</hi> and <hi>abſtine.</hi> Now although by their rules they would teach a man to bear afflictions, yet this is but a ſplendid ſinne. It's from Chriſt onely we can be ſtrengthned to ſuch things. And <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4. 12. ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I am instructed as in a ſecret myſtery, to know how to abound, and how to ſuffer need.</hi> Wonder not then if you read of what fortitude and patience, even to admiration <hi>Heathens</hi> have excelled in, who yet were not ſtrengthned by Chriſt: for vain-glory and corrupt aims may make men contemn their lives; yea, and the Devil many times filleth ſuch with boldneſs and preſumption; as we ſee in blaſphemous Hereticks, who have ſhewed great confidence in their death. For as the Devil, when he poſſeſſed the bodies of ſome perſons, filled them with more ſtrength than naturally they had, ſo that they have been able to break iron chains in pieces; thus when he filleth the hearts of men by Gods juſt judgement with impudency and mad undaunted boldneſs, they will willingly adventure any danger whatſoever. The Devil hurrieth ſuch into danger, yea death it ſelf, as he did the ſwine into the ſea.</p>

                  </gap>. This word is uſed only there and in my Text. It may ſeem then a contradiction for the Apoſtle here to ſay, <hi>He was without all help or means,</hi> and there to ſay, <hi>The godly never are.</hi> But the anſwer is eaſie. For when in the Text <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He was without all help or means,</hi> he meaneth <hi>natural and viſible;</hi> There was no <hi>outward</hi> way to help him. Not but that God might deliver him in a way he did not ſee or apprehend; and ſo indeed God did deliver him, as appeareth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Therefore when in that fourth Chapter he ſaith, <hi>The godly are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo deſtitute as to be without help,</hi> he meaneth ſo as to have neither <hi>divine or humane help.</hi> Even as in the ſame place <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the godly <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The word thus explained, the ſumme of his meaning is, That this trouble was ſo great, that it brought him into ſuch a ſtraight, that in reſpect of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane help, there was a neceſſity of his death, and this fear of death did much afflict and aſſault the ſpirit of <hi>Paul.</hi> Some render the word <hi>taederet,</hi> ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> was even weary of his life, as if he deſired to die, his trouble was ſo great. Some with our Tranſlators, <hi>We despaired of life.</hi> But <hi>Beza</hi> doth willingly abſtain from that word; therefore that which doth moſt expreſs the ſignificancy of the word, is ſuch a perplexity and doubting in his mind about his life, that he could not ſee any wayes to eſcape; he was like <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Whales belly, out of which there was no viſible way to be delivered. So that the word implieth theſe two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>Paul</hi> was very anxious about his life, and was afraid of death.</item>
                  <item>2. That fleſh and blood did conclude there was no help for him, becauſe outwardly there did not appear any. From whence we may obſerve this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:48709:155"/>
                  <hi>That Grace, though it be never ſo lively and active, yet doth not remove the natural fear of death.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">No grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the natural fear of death.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Grace doth not deſtroy nature. This holy Apoſtle, who is ſo confident of the love of God, and can triumph in all diſtreſſes, is yet afraid of death, is yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſolicitous about the preſerving of his life. There is a <hi>natural fear of death,</hi> becauſe there is implanted in a man a deſire of ſelf-preſervation, ſo that to be without it would be a ſinne. And then there is a <hi>ſinfull fear of death,</hi> which ariſeth from ſinne, or tendeth to ſinne. Now the grace of God doth at leaſt in ſome meaſure conquer the latter, but it cannot overcome the former. Hence <hi>Jacob</hi> for fear of death, we ſee him in a great ſtraight upon his meeting with his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> greatly praying to God to turn the heart of his brother, and alſo ſtudying to mollifie his ſpirit, with preſents he ſent to him. <hi>David</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was very ſollicitous in the preſervation of his life, when <hi>Saul</hi> did ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly purſue him. Yea <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though he had the teſtimony of a good conſcience, and could appeal even to God, <hi>That he had ſerved him with an upright heart, and in truth,</hi> yet when the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> declared to him, that he muſt die, it is ſaid, <hi>He wept ſore,</hi> Iſa. 28. 2, 3. and at the ninth verſe, we have a deſcription of the bitterneſs of his ſoul under thoſe fears. Yea the Lord Chriſt himſelf, <hi>In whom was found no ſinne,</hi> yet we find him greatly affected with the fear of death. And although he had a peculiar reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>tasted of death for our ſake,</hi> and ſo did therein bare our ſinnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting with the wrath of God due to us, yet there was included in this a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fear of death.</hi> They that make <hi>Christs</hi> fear of death only <hi>natural,</hi> and ſay, therefore he was more ſadly affected with it, than any of the Prophets or Martyrs, becauſe of the exquiſite and tender conſtitution of his body, do greatly derogate from that work of mediation for us, and ſatisfaction, which was done by his blood to the juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>From theſe examples you ſee, that though grace can ſubdue ſinne, conquer luſts, overcome the Devil, yet it cannot totally take away the anxiety and fear of death, which is altogether natural, though the ſinfulneſs of it may be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. But to this it may be objected, How could <hi>Paul</hi> be ſo ſollicitous about death, when <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. he ſaith, <hi>He had a deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt?</hi> Yea he did not know what to chooſe, whether life or death, <hi>He was in a ſtraight betwixt two, a deſire to be with Chriſt, and a deſire to live,</hi> that he might be ſerviceable to the Church? That this may be anſwered, it is good to take more exact notice of that place; for it is an admirable demonſtration of the gracious frame of <hi>Paul</hi>'s heart: leſt the <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould think that he deſired their prayers for himſelf now in bonds for the Goſpel, as being too inordinately affected to the deſire of life, he ſheweth what a bleſſed frame of heart he had obtained unto; even that if it were put to his choice, whether he ſhould live or die. he ſhould be ſtraightned what to do; The deſire to be with Chriſt on one ſide, did ſo affect him, and the deſire of the Churches good by his labours on the other ſide did ſo much work upon him: where we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that his deſire to depart was not becauſe he had troubles and calamities here, it was not becauſe of the miſeries and afflictions he met with, but want of love to Chriſt, <hi>That I may be with Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he; he doth not ſay, that I may have glory, that I may reign in Heaven, but <hi>be with Chriſt. Chriſts</hi> preſence maketh Heaven to be Heaven. Though <hi>Paul</hi> in this life was <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> yet he was not <hi>with Chriſt.</hi> Further, he doth not ſay meerly, <hi>I deſire,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Having a deſire;</hi> it was a conſtant, ſetled, permanent deſire in him, and that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to cut the rope (as it were) and to ſet fail to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to return to him from whom he had his ſpiritual being. The Apoſtle
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48709:155"/>
then did not only deſire to be <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> but he judged it the <hi>farre better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> for him.</p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt diſtinguiſh of a two-fold deſire; there is a <hi>Natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The difference betwixt a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and an elicite deſire.</note> and an <hi>Elicite Deſire.</hi> A <hi>Natural Deſire</hi> is that which floweth from the meer principles of Nature, deſiring to preſerve it ſelf; and this <hi>Paul</hi> could not but have as he was a man. Even as our Saviour told <hi>Peter, He ſhould be bound, and ſhould be carried whether he would not,</hi> Joh. 21. 18. that is, according to his natural will, otherwiſe according to his will as ſanctified, did with readineſs and joy go to the place of his Martyrdom. An <hi>Elicite Deſire</hi> is that which a man putteth forth according to the principles of reaſon and grace, ſo that we may deſire one thing with a <hi>natural deſire,</hi> another thing with an <hi>elicite.</hi> A man that hath a putrified arm, doth with a <hi>natural deſire</hi> will to continue his arm ſtill in his body, but with an <hi>elicite deſire</hi> following reaſon, ſo he willeth to cut it off: And thus <hi>Paul</hi> did with an <hi>elicite deſire,</hi> ſo he willed Heaven and being with Chriſt, rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>To amplifie this, Conſider, <note place="margin">Propoſitions clearing the truth. 1. Man was not made mortal.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That death is not according to mans creation at firſt, he was not made mortal or corruptible:</hi> But as the ſentence of God doth witneſs, In the day <hi>Adam</hi> did eat of the forbidden fruit, he fell into a dying condition. It is true, The Queſtion is of a large diſpute, Whether <hi>Adam</hi> was made immortal or no? The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, he was made mortal; and the <hi>Socinians</hi> they do more frowardly oppoſe this truth, affirming, <hi>Adam</hi> would have died, though there had not been any eating of the forbidden fruit. So that with them actual death was neceſſary before <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne; only it became a puniſhment after. But <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the Apoſtle at large ſheweth, <hi>That by one mans ſinne death came into the world.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 6. 23. The wages of ſinne is death.</hi> Death then being wholly againſt the natural inſtitution: At firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had an implanted love of his life in him. And although his eſtate was ſo bleſſed, that there could not be place for any fear, yet had he been capable of loſing his life, his love to it would have made him afraid of being deprived of it. This then is the great myſtery, that the natural wiſe men of the world were ignorant of. Death they would not deny, they called it, <hi>The tribute of Nature, which all muſt pay;</hi> only they did not know the cauſe of it, they underſtood not how it came to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe upon all mankind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Seeing that death is thus connatural, and the effect of ſinne and <note place="margin">2. Tis ſin that maketh death ſo terrible.</note> the Devil, <hi>Hence it is that which maketh Death farre more terrible than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would be, is ſinne.</hi> Whatſoever bitterneſs and gall is in death, it doth chiefly come from ſinne, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 56. The ſting of death is ſinne.</hi> So many ſinnes as thou committeſt, thou putteſt ſo many ſtings into death to make it more dreadfull. Could a man die, and have not any ſinne laid to his charge, though it would be pain, yet it would not be terrour. When <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth death <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The terrible of terribles.</hi> He ſpeaketh of death as now it is. Now in death, as ordinarily men die, there is not a bare apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the diſſolution of ſoul and body, but there is the guilt of ſinne likewiſe interpoſing, whereby a dying man is uſually terrified with the thoughts of what he hath done, and in Chriſtians, what will become of them when they are dead. <hi>Animula blandula, quae nunc abibis in loca.</hi> Die I dare not, live I cannot; and thus his ſoul is miſerably in agonies, and grievous tormenting fears, and all becauſe ſinne is the ſting of death. Oh it were eaſie to die were it not for ſinne, for hell, for judgement, were it not for conſcience accuſing and condemning. But this is it which maketh the thoughts of it ſo grievous and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. <note place="margin">3. Chriſt came into the world to remove this ſting of death, ſinne.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore in the third place, <hi>The Lord Chriſt came into the world to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and remove this ſting of death.</hi> To change the nature of death that it
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:48709:156"/>
ſhould not be matter of terror, but of joy and comfort; being like <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Chariot to carry us to the place of our hope and deſire. Thus we have the Apoſtle inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over death, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 54, 55. Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> Death doth not ſwallow the godly man, but he doth ſwallow that up: <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? Thanks be to God which giveth us victory by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Were it not then for Chriſt, what would become of a poor humbled ſinner? What terrour would compaſſe him about? This powerfull effect of Chriſts death (for death overcometh death) is notably ſpoken of, <hi>Heb. 2. 14. That through death he might deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi> A learned man <hi>Cocceius</hi> underſtands this of the <hi>Jewes</hi> eſpecially, who becauſe of thoſe many Ceremonial Lawes, they were in bondage to, were in continual fear of death, becauſe the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of many of thoſe Lawes God made capital, they were to die for it: hence they could not be, but in conſtant fear of death. But it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more genuine to interpret more largely, as an effect of Chriſts death to believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> It is from Chriſt only that the terrible thoughts of death can be mitigated, otherwiſe to a man not in Chriſt it is the beginning of hell.</p>
               <p>But in the fourth place, <hi>Though to the godly thus death is changed in its</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Yet howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever nature cannot but tremble at the thoughts of it.</note> 
                  <hi>Nature. The Serpent hath its ſting taken out; Moſes</hi> need not runne from it, it is only turned into a rod of a fatherly chaſtiſement, yet <hi>Nature cannot but tremble at the approaches of it.</hi> The heart of that man, who is moſt heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though he would gladly be in <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet he is not willing to paſſe through this wilderneſſe to it; he would be cloathed with immortality, but is unwilling to put off this garment of the body. We would be happy, but we would not die. As children cry for a new garment to have it on, and yet cry while it is putting on: ſo greatly is the love of life, and the fear of death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed <note place="margin">Of what uſe the natural fear of death is. 1. Hence men do more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure afflictions.</note> in the very heart of a man. And ſo farre as this fear of death is only na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, not immoderate, it is of great uſe. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby men do more patiently abide under their afflictions.</hi> As long as it is not death, they do the more willingly bear it. <hi>Lament. 3. 39. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth a living man complain?</hi> If a man be greatly puniſhed for his ſinnes, yet if God keep him alive, he hath cauſe to be more patient. Thus Satan thought <hi>(Job 2. 4.) Skinne for skinne, and all that a man hath he will give for life.</hi> Therefore he would have <hi>Job</hi> tryed in that. Fear then of death is a mercy, becauſe hereby men may the more readily ſit down under other afflictions that are not ſo bad as death. When therefore men come to ſuch high diſcontents as <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> becauſe his counſel was neglected: or ſuch deſpairing terrours of conſcience as <hi>Judas</hi> did, that they chooſe to die, yea to make away them ſelves. This as it is an heavy temptation and deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, ſo it argueth that by the fear of death, men do patiently abide under their diſtreſſes; but when they care not for this, they voluntarily throw themſelves into the flame of hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The natural fear of death is of great uſe in this reſpect, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It keeps men out of many ſins.</note> 
                  <hi>it doth keep men from the committing of many ſinnes, which otherwiſe they would ſecurely offend in.</hi> Hence God appointed in the Law, the puniſhment of death for many ſinnes. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. the Apoſtle biddeth him that doth evil, be afraid of the powers, <hi>Becauſe they bear not the ſword in vain.</hi> It is therefore the fear of death that maketh men keep within bounds of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and honeſty. It is not the fear of God, nor the fear of hell, nor the fear of ſinne it ſelf, but a bodily corporal death that reſtraineth men from ſinne. So that if men come to that height of obſtinacy, as not to fear death, they are prepared for any impiety, <hi>Vitam qui contempſit ſuam tuae Dominus eſt.</hi> When the Devil would perſwade <hi>Eve</hi> to ſinne, he telleth
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:48709:156"/>
her, <hi>She ſhall not die;</hi> he giveth her hopes of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The natural fear of death is thus farre advantagious, <hi>That it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It makes a man more thankfull for the mercies of life.</note> 
                  <hi>a man more thankefull for the mercies of his life, for his food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which go to the preſervation of his life.</hi> Therefore a godly man doth make advantage of this fear of death, to ſtirre up himſelf to all thankfulneſſe, to look up unto God, as knowing, <hi>That in him onely we live, move, and have our being.</hi> It is alſo from this fear of death, that the godly are more quickned to improve the day of grace; to be working while it is called to day. Thoſe that had made a <hi>Couenant with death,</hi> they grew deſperate, <hi>Let us eat and drinke, for to morrow we ſhall die,</hi> whereas rather to have concluded, Let us pray, mourn rnd repent, leſt to morrow we die. If therefore the godly are at any time greatly dejected with the fear of death, the thoughts of it are a great temptation, they ſadly complain, that they cannot conquer thoſe ſlaviſh thoughts; the memory of death is bitter to them, they cannot take any joy, when they think of it: Let them, among other things remember, to turne this water into wine by faith: Let them make an advantage of this natural infirmity. Doeſt thou fear to die? Then be more thankfull to God for the dayes and years he hath given thee in this world. Doeſt thou fear to die? Oh then be fruitfull, live holily, make a good uſe of thy health, that ſo when death ſhall come, it may be only death thou ſhalt grapple with, not death and ſin alſo, death and the anger of God with it. Death enough is terrible, do not thou make it fuller of horrour.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>This natural fear of death is very difficultly kept from being a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. The natural fear of death is very hardly kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinfull.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinfull fear.</hi> It is very hard to regulate and order it aright, ſo that in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or other it doth not go beyond its bounds. It's hard ſo to fear, and not to over-fear. Even the moſt godly have found this fear of death to be a great ſnare to them; They have not done the good they ſhould have done, becauſe of this fear: They have gone againſt conſcience, wounded their ſpirits, becauſe of fear. <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he was the <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi> yet did uſe ſinfull equivocation with <hi>Abimelech</hi> about <hi>Sarah,</hi> from which many ſad evils might have been committed, and all was this ſinfull fear of death. Though a godly man be allowed to have a <hi>natural fear of death,</hi> yet he muſt take heed of a <hi>ſinfull fear.</hi> This hath brought many into ſuch grievous ſinnes, that the fear of their conſciences about Gods anger, about hell and damnation, have quite ſwallowed up the fears of death, at laſt the greater fear hath devoured the leſſe. To whom are woes and wounds of conſcience by apoſtaſie and forſaking of Chriſt, but to thoſe who have too exceſſively been afraid of death? As we ſee in <hi>Peter,</hi> and many others. Our next work therefore is to ſhew, when the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fear of death goeth beyond its bounds, and becometh ſinfull.</p>

               <p>THis laſt aggravating particular in the deſcription of <hi>Paul</hi>'s trouble in <hi>Aſia,</hi> hath been explained, and in ſome meaſure enlarged. The ſumme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was, <hi>That grace even in a</hi> Paul, <hi>doth not wholly remove the natural fear of death.</hi> Grace doth regulate and direct Nature, but not extinguiſh it. <hi>Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> differ as much as Heaven and Earth. Not to fear, not to grieve about due objects in a due manner, is a ſinne, not a vertue. But though grace doth not extirpate this natural fear of death, yet it ſubdueth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth the ſinfull fear of death. Our natural fear doth quickly become immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and ſo offenſive unto God. Therefore the proper work of grace is to mortifie this, that it may not be over-fearing, that this fear may not prove a temptation to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Our work therefore in the next place, is to direct a Chriſtian in the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between a <hi>Natural fear,</hi> and a <hi>Sinfull fear,</hi> that he may know what is of <note place="margin">There is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fear of death in all, but in ſome more, in ſome leſſe.</note> meer nature and what is of corrupt nature. Only it is good to take notice of this:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That a natural fear of death may be in ſome more, and in ſome leſſe, from the very conſtitution and temperament of their body.</hi> Some are very fearfull by their very natural complexion, and to ſuch death is more dreadfull than to others, who are of a more bold and ſtout conſtitution: Even as ſome are more prone to anger than others; ſo ſome are more prone to fear than others; and this being a natural paſſion, they cannot conquer it, no more than grace can change the temperament of the body. Onely to the godly, ſuch a natural fear is ſanctified: They go out of themſelves, they depend much upon God. And therefore ſome who have been aſſaulted exceedingly with fears in the times of perſecution, ſuſpecting their own ſelves, that they ſhould prove perfidious to Chriſt, and Apoſtates, have found unexpected courage and boldneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have gone out of themſelves, and truſted in God only. Theſe Lambs have proved Lions. Hence the Scripture, antidotes and comfortable promiſes againſt this fear, <hi>Iſa. 53. 4. Say to them that are of a fearfull heart, Be ſtrong, feare not.</hi> Yea we have a precious promiſe to the godly, that under Chriſts government and protection over them, <hi>Ier. 23. 4. They ſhall fear no more, nor be diſmayed.</hi> If then the godly find himſelf of a fearfull diſpoſition, that it is a natural paſſion tyrannizing over him, let him pray for the ſanctification of it, that God would turn it to his good; and many times ſuch are preſerved from thoſe wounds of conſcience, and thoſe ſad falls, which thoſe that are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and ſelf-confident do fall into. As there is thus a natural paſſion of fear about death in ſome more than in others, ſo alſo ſometimes (by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion)
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48709:157"/>
the children of God have been aſſaulted by it as a peculiar temptation, and that improved by Satan. So that whereas there are ſeveral kindes of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, whereby the Devil doth moleſt and diſquiet the godly, ſometimes by blaſphemous thoughts, ſometimes by fear of committing that unpardonable ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſometimes it is by a daily and conſtant fear of death, ſuch a perſwaſion of death doth fall upon them, and that accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much diſtracting fear and tembling, that it takes away the comfortable enjoyment of all thoſe mercies God beſtoweth upon them. This hath been the caſe of many of the children of God, and the Devils deſigne is by theſe unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and needleſſe feares, to keep them from that ſervice, which otherwiſe they might do for God. For as Timber too moiſt, and not well dried, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the builder, and not ſupport the houſe, as it is expected: ſo neither can a Chriſtian, amazed with ſuch dividing fears, do God that ſervice in his place, as he ought to do. Theſe are like wormes in the wood, that at laſt eat up the heart of it. Such therefore that are buffeted with theſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they have no other wayes to take, but to flie unto God: He is the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who can give power and ſtrength to them, as was done to <hi>Daniel,</hi> in his great amazement, and unto the Scripture, as a directive Rule, from whence he may wiſely obſerve many remedies againſt ſuch prepoſterous feares. Let him alſo poſſeſſe his ſoul with this as an undoubted principle, That the Lord bindeth him in this chain (as it were) to prevent other ſinnes that he may boldly venture upon; and that theſe feares con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>death doth manifeſt it ſelf to be ſinfull.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When it becometh a ſnare to a man, ſo that by it, he either commits ſome ſinne, or omits ſome duty.</hi> When the fear of death hath this influence upon thee, then know it exceedeth its limits. Thou feareſt men more than God, thou feareſt death more than hell and damnation, <hi>Prov. 29. 25. The fear of a man bringeth a ſnare.</hi> When it bringeth a ſnare upon thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſaith, Doe not this; the Word of God ſaith, Doe not this; but fear of death ſaith, Doe this, then this becometh very ſad in the iſſue; as you ſee it was in <hi>Peter,</hi> fear made him deny his Maſter. So in <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though ſo great examples of holineſſe, yet fear of death put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lying and diſſimulation. Now to ſinne for fear of death, is a moſt abſurd and irrational fear; to fear the leſſe, and not to fear the greater. Thou doeſt not fear to be damned, yet thou feareſt to die. How fully doth our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the folly of this fear? <hi>Luk. 12. 4, 5. I ſay to you my friends.</hi> Though the Diſciples had this comfortable title and encouraging relation upon them (what could be greater than to be Chriſts friend? Will Chriſt forſake his friend in adverſity? Shall any have cauſe to ſay to Chriſt, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> to <hi>Huſhai, Is this thy kindneſs to thy friend?)</hi> Yet how ready are they to fear men and death immoderately? Therefore he exhorteth them, <hi>Not to be afraid of men, who can kill the body, and after that have no more than they can do; but I will forewarne you whom you ſhall fear.</hi> They need premonitions about it; the object whereof is, <hi>God who hath power to caſt into hell,</hi> which he redoubleth, <hi>yea I ſay to you, fear him.</hi> So that by this place we ſee, that it is a moſt and unreaſonable fear, to venture the damnation of our ſouls for fear of death: Yet how often hath this been done? but ſometimes it hath proved ſo diſmall, as in <hi>Spira,</hi> and others, that the guilt of ſinne, and the terrors of Gods wrath falling upon their conſcience, have ſo greatly overwhelmed them, that the fear of death hath been quite put out by a greater fear. They have deſired death, yea they have haſtened to it, by offering
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48709:158"/>
violence to themſelves. As the fear of death is thus ſinfull when it putteth thee upon ſinne: ſo when it maketh thee omit any duty that God requireth; thou dareſt not confeſs God and his truth in the midſt of a perverſe generation; thou dareſt not be valiant for the truth, nor plead for righteouſneſs, this fear is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive. Love to God, love to his glory ſhould caſt out the fear of death. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve then thy ſelf in dangers or temptations, how thou findeſt thy fear to put thee upon ſinfull compliances or omiſſions, and preſently, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> in the midſt of a battel being in great danger, cried out unto God for help, ſo do thou to be delivered from this ſinfull fear, that is a deadly enemy encompaſſing thee about.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thy fear about death is ſinfull, when it is immoderate and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. When it is immoderate and diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
                  <hi>of thee, ſo that thou doeſt not walk with a cheerfull quiet and calm ſpirit.</hi> So that although it may not put thee upon any ſinfull or unlawfull enterprize, yet if it fill thee with anxieties, with trepidations, ſo that it depriveth thee of that Evangelical joy and peace; in this exceſs it is a ſinne. All that are truly godly, <hi>Being juſtified by faith they are to have peace</hi> in their hearts; yea they are to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce alwayes in the Lord;</hi> but the inordinate fear of death cauſeth this Sunne to be in an eclipſe: and as men ſubject to ſwooning fits, or convulſions, cannot go with that courage and confidence up and down, as thoſe who are freed from ſuch diſtempers; Thus alſo the ſlaviſh and immoderate fear of death putteth millſtones about our neck, is a continual <hi>Ephialtes</hi> upon the ſoul, filleth the ſpirit with heavineſs, whereby that Evangelical life and Goſpel-converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we are called unto, is ſeldome or never exerciſed. Obſerve then thy ſelf, doth ſuch fears of death make thy ſoul full of tumults and diſtractions? Doth it oppoſe any Evangelical grace, or retard the Spirit of Adoption upon thy ſoul? Then humble thy ſelf, know thou ſinneſt againſt God, and pray for the mortification of it; and this thou art to do, though it doth not make thee put out thy hand to any evil way; though it doth not make thee omit any known duty. For as worldly and diſtruſtfull cares, though lodging only in the heart, are greatly diſpleaſing to God, though we do not thereby fall into covetous and unjuſt wayes, yet the very cares and diſtractions of the heart are forbidden, as appeareth by that reproof given to <hi>Martha,</hi> by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Luke 10. 41. Martha, Martha, thou art troubled about many things, but one thing is needfull.</hi> Thus it is alſo in fears, though thou art not inſtigated thereby to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull wayes to preſerve thy ſelf, yet the diſtractions and diviſions of thy heart are offenſive to God. Therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. Be carefull in nothing, but let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> Let prayer rebuke all ſtorms and tempeſts of ſinfull cares, ſo in nothing be fearfull, no not about death it ſelf, but commit thy ſelf by prayer to God, to whom the iſſues of life and death do belong</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This fear of death is ſinfull, when it excludeth better and more profitable, and ſeaſonable fear.</hi> The Scripture doth frequently command <hi>a fear</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. When it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth much profitable and ſeaſonable fear</note> 
                  <hi>of God, and the ſerving of him with godly trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2. 11. Yea the whole work of grace is expreſſed in this, <hi>That God will put his fear in our hearts, Jer.</hi> 32. 40. If then this fear of God did more prevail and rule in our hearts, we ſhould not fear diſeaſes and death ſo much as we do: The fear of God would put a due moderation upon all the powers of the ſoul: This would regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the fear of all other things, ſo that we dare not fear otherwayes than God hath commanded, then this natural fear is compatible with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fear. For as our love to the creatures muſt be animated and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our love to God, ſo that we are never to love any thing, that thereby our love to God may be abated or diminiſhed: Thus it muſt be in fear, we are never to dread any thing further than it is conſiſtent with the fear of God; therefore it may fall out ſometimes, that the fear of God may juſtly put us
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48709:158"/>
upon the fear of death, as when we walk negligently, coldly and formally; when we do not make up our daily accounts with God; when we do not make our daily peace with God, with renewed repentance and faith. If we live in this manner, then we have good cauſe to fear death, becauſe we are unprovided for it, it ſeizeth on us before we are prepared; and the fear of God may juſtly put us into this fear of death. For we know how great, holy and juſt God is, how dreadfull his appearance will be at the day of judgement; and all that we can do, it muſt be done before death; then <hi>the night is come, and none can work.</hi> To repent, to bewail our unprofitableneſs, our neglect of the ſeaſons of grace in hell, will then be as unprofitable, as <hi>Eſau</hi>'s teares when he had loſt his birth-right. There is therefore a juſt and holy fear about death, leſt it ſhould take us not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of God; leſt it ſhould come ſo unexpectedly, that we be forced to cry out with him, <hi>Inducias uſque ad mane! O ſpare me till to morrow!</hi> Let one live another day to make peace with God, and the fear of God will put us upon this fear, as the Apoſtle ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 11. Knowing the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade men.</hi> Thus it is here, <hi>Knowing the terrour of the Lord,</hi> that he is greater than our hearts, that if they condemn us, then God will much more; This will put a fear of death upon us, becauſe that is nothing but the preſenting of our ſouls in his preſence. We read <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 23. and in many other places, when God made any glorious apparition, the perſons who beheld it were ſo amazed and ſtricken with the ſenſe of their imbecillty, that they thought they ſhould die preſently; and ſhall not the thoughts about death, that it's the diſlodging of the ſoul and bringing it immediately before God, ſtrike much terrour into us? This holy and reverential fear about death is laudable, and is the fruit of the fear of God; but when this fear of death maketh thee fear God the leſs, or hindereth thee in the ſervice of him, then caſt this <hi>Hagar</hi> out of doors.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The fear of death is ſinfull, when it doth proceed from a ſinfull cauſe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. When it proceeds from a ſinfull cauſe, as from 1. An inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate love of life.</note> If the fountain be bitter, then the ſtream is bitter. Now there are theſe ſinfull cauſes of the fear of death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When it proceedeth from <hi>an inordinate love of life.</hi> An exceſſive love of life doth alwayes beget an immoderate fear of death. So that we may judge of the ſinfulneſs of fear by the ſinfulneſs of love: If thy heart be not mortified and crucified to the world, if thy heart be not looſned and weaned from earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; and this maketh thee afraid to die, this is ſinfull. It is a fundamental qualification required in every Diſciple of Chriſt; he cannot be Chriſts, unleſs he be above the love of all things, <hi>Matth. 10. 37. He that loveth father, or mother, or life it ſelf, more than me, cannot be my Diſoiple.</hi> Why then art thou ſo afraid to die? Is it becauſe thy heart is ſo dearly engaged in ſuch relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſuch creatures? Be humbled for this, and reform.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſinfull cauſe which floweth from the former, is, <hi>The want of love</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The want of love to God.</note> 
                  <hi>to God, and to Chriſt.</hi> Thy deſire is not with <hi>Paul, To be with Christ;</hi> thou doeſt not <hi>judge this beſt of all.</hi> Not to be willing to die upon this account, muſt alſo be very ſinfull. Do we not pray for the <hi>Kingdome of God?</hi> Are we not to look for, and haſten the coming of Chriſt? Are we not to be as pilgrims and ſtrangers in this world? Now if theſe things were real upon thee, though thou couldſt not avoid a natural fear, yet thou wouldſt greatly ſubdue a ſinfull fear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a ſinfull cauſe of the fear of death, <hi>When we produce thoſe actions,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. A ſinfull life.</note> 
                  <hi>and live ſuch a life, which will juſtly make death terrible.</hi> Thou complaineſt, I am afraid to die, I dare not think of death, and why? Thou doeſt put ſtings into death, thou increaſeſt the guilt of thy conſcienne, by living without repentance and reformation; and then it is no wonder if ſuch a ſinfull cauſe make a ſinfull effect. Sinne leſs, keep thy conſcience clear, and then thou wilt fear death leſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:48709:159"/>
The laſt ſinfull cauſe of the ſinfull fear of death, is, <hi>Want of faith in Chriſt,</hi> and this even the godly are ſubject to, though they live holily and unblameably, <note place="margin">4. Want of faith in Chriſt.</note> though they have kept a good conſcience towards God and men, yet they have ſometimes uncomfortable fears about death, becauſe they do not look upon Chriſt, they conſider not that Chriſt hath conquered death. So that now every Chriſtian may with <hi>Paul</hi> triumph, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory, O death, where is thy ſting?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54, 55. but want of faith depriveth of this holy comfort and boldneſs. See then if thy want of faith maketh thee fear death; and conſider that if ſo, this is very injurious to Chriſt, as if ſtill death were not ſubdued, as if death had conquered Chriſt, and not Chriſt death. Faith will make thee ſee a lovelineſs and another nature in death, than what it had at firſt.</p>

               <p>The word then doth ſignifie a ſentence paſſing upon him, <hi>That he muſt die.</hi> This he had received; but from whom?

               </p>
               <p>They are apt to erre in their judgements about Gods diſpenſation. They ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch concluſions, and make ſuch inferences as are wholly oppoſite to Gods intentions. Though it be ſaid that the people of God do communicate with Chriſt in ſome meaſure, as with his prieſtly and Kingly Office, ſo with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical, as if they were able to know the mind of God in many things, yet we muſt take heed that ſuch a principle doth not draw us into ſpiritual deluſions. For nothing is more ordinary even to a godly man, then to take his ſtrong affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and vehement conjectures for impulſes and inſpirations from God. <hi>Paul</hi> in this trouble did abſolutely conclude, <hi>He ſhould die;</hi> he had paſt this ſentence upon himſelf, but God had determined otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall handle this truth more generally than the Text doth intend, yet inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that alſo. And</p>

                  <hi>give ſuch adviſe to others ſometimes, which he may apprehend is of God, and yet it ariſeth from humane perſwaſion only.</hi> Thoſe that are godly are conſtantly and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly to examine, what is humane, and what is divine in them; what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God, and what from their own ſpirits. Sad and miſerable have the deceits of many been in this caſe. No wonder it may be ſo with a godly man. For it hath ſometimes fared thus with thoſe, who beſides the ſpirit of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, have alſo been endowed with prophetical illumination. <hi>Nathan, 1 Chron.</hi> 17. 2. bid <hi>David do all that was in his heart,</hi> when he purpoſed to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48709:160"/>
build an houſe to God; but we ſee afterwards God did forbid it. It is true, there were in the Old Teſtament falſe prophets, who did wittingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne, pretending they had a word from God, when it was only a lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them; but of ſuch we ſpeak not. Yea we read of a true Prophet of the Lord, yet pretending a word from God, when he did wilfully diſſemble all that while, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 18. For when a Prophet had command from God not to eat or drink in his journey; This other Prophet perſwadeth him to eat, ſaying, <hi>An Angel of God ſpake to him for that purpoſe.</hi> Here was a great temptation to the former Prophet to eat; it could not but work ſome ſcruples in him. So that from this inſtance Divines do argue, That it is lawfull for a man to goe againſt ſcruples. But becauſe the Prophet did not, but was perſwaded againſt Gods former command, therefore he was ſeverely puniſhed. But this inſtance is not fully to my purpoſe; onely from that example we may ſee, That the corruption in man inclineth him to make pretences from God to get the more credit. Even as in <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, ſome pretended the Spirit and Revelations about the day of judgement. But the example of <hi>Nathan</hi> is wholly to our purpoſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that fear God, are to pray for an exact judgement, to diſcern between things that differ, and that more in our ſelves than others. For ſuch is our ſelf-love that we are difficultly brought to know the truth: As a ſenſible object put immediately upon the ſenſe, hindereth it in its operations. We ſee <hi>Paul</hi> very imitable in this thing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. in anſwering that caſe about marriage, which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had propounded to him. Hence <hi>verſ. 10. &amp;</hi> 12. how carefull is he to diſtinguiſh between that which he had from the Lord directly, and was his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed will, and what he adviſed as a faithfull Officer in the Church, <hi>Not I, but the Lord,</hi> ſaith he. Hence he concludeth his Diſcourſe in a moſt humble and modeſt manner, calling it <hi>his judgement,</hi> onely adding, <hi>I think alſo that I have the Spirit of God.</hi> Though you muſt know, that in all this <hi>Paul</hi> was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infallibly by the Spirit; he ſpeaketh not as an humane Authour in this thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The godly are deceived, when they have ſome prepoſſeſſed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of errour in them, and then think Gods dispenſations are to abet and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. They are deceived when they thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Gods diſpenſations are to abet ſome errours which they may be fallen into.</note> 
                  <hi>them.</hi> This hath commonly cauſed great miſtakes, whereby men have thought they had Gods approbation to their deceits. We ſee this plainly in the Diſciples, this falſe principle they had imbibed, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> would come as a temporal and external King, to vindicate their Nation from all the bondage they were under. Therefore when Chriſt ſpeaketh of his Kingdome, and his Glory, when he ſpeaketh of being exalted, they apply all conſonantly to their falſe principles. Upon this miſtake the ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> come to ask Chriſt for the chiefeſt places of honour in his Kingdom, and upon Chriſts Aſcenſion in Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6. when he had for fourty dayes together been ſpeaking of the Kingdom of God to them: Then they asked him, <hi>Wilt thou at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Kingdome of Iſrael?</hi> Here you ſee how much even the Apoſtles, the firſt fruits (as it were) of the Spirit were decived; But what was the <gap reason="foreign">

We ſee hom <hi>Samuel,</hi> a man ſo highly proficient in the fear of God, and all integrity, yet when he came to chooſe out the man
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48709:160"/>
God had deſigned for the Kingdom, how quickly he miſtook, and was at a loſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 6, 7. For when <hi>Eliab</hi> came into his preſence, he ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lords anointed is here.</hi> But then obſerve how God did reprove his humane judgement, when he ſaid to <hi>Samuel, Look not upon his high ſtature, for the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth,</hi> adding alſo the ground of it, <hi>becauſe man judgeth by outward appearance, but God judgeth the heart.</hi> It is true, the godly have this promiſe, that many things ſhall be manifeſted to them, which to others the Lord will not reveal, <hi>Pſal. 25. 14. The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him.</hi> Hence we have that notable expreſſion to <hi>Abraham</hi> by God, when he was purpoſed to deſtroy <hi>Sodome,</hi> Gen. 18. 17. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I will do?</hi> and one reaſon is, <hi>becauſe he will command his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his houſhold to keep the way of the Lord.</hi> We have likewiſe a very comfortable expreſſion which our Saviour uſeth to his Diſciples, <hi>John 15. 15. Henceforth I call you not ſervants, for the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have called you friends, for all things I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.</hi> From this it is, that ſome eminently godly men have been endowed with a prophetical ſpirit, and have uſed much boldneſs in prayer to God, as that known expreſſion of <hi>Luthers, Fiat voluntas mea Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> In <hi>Savo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>la</hi> likewiſe, even <hi>Machiavil</hi> did acknowledge a Divine Spirit in him: Many things he fore-told, which came to paſſe, and had bold acceſſe to the throne of grace, as if he had been another <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpeaking to God face to face. In his <hi>Homilies</hi> upon <hi>Micah</hi> he hath wonderfull aſſertions about his predictions. But extraordinary priviledges, and that in ſome caſes onely, muſt not be extended to all. When the glory of God, and the good of his Church is concerned, God doth come with more familiar diſcoveries of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than at other times. But though this be ſo, yet the godly are many times decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in themſelves and about others, and that becauſe they judge according to outward appearance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then are the people of God apt to be <hi>deceived about themſelves,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. When they give too much credit to their zeal and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> 
                  <hi>When they yeeld too much, or give too much credit to the ſtrong affections, and raiſed zeale, as they thinke, for the glory of God.</hi> In ſuch particulars they have many times failed as men, yea ſo as they have ſinned thereby, and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> did exceedingly fail, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 23. when out of his great affection to his Maſter, he ſaid, <hi>Master, ſave thy ſelf;</hi> What a ſevere reproof did his humane affections meet with? <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, for thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureſt not the things of God, but of man.</hi> Little did <hi>Peter</hi> expect ſuch words for that which he thought was his good will, if not piety to Chriſt. The like al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we find in thoſe Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 55. when they would have fire come from Heaven to be avenged on the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> becauſe they would not receive Chriſt; for there Chriſt gave them a check, ſaying, <hi>Ye know not what ſpirit ye are of.</hi> They thought that to be a Divine Spirit, they thought the ſame hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly breathing and motion to be upon them, as was upon <hi>Elias;</hi> but (alas) they did not know what ſpirit it was. We find alſo <hi>Paul</hi> deceived, or at leaſt forbidden in ſome paſſages which he thought greatly promoting the glory of God, <hi>Act. 16. 6. Paul</hi> was <hi>forbidden to preach the Word in Aſia,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a deſire and an attempt in him to do it. And <hi>verſ. 7. Paul eſſayed to go into Bythinia, but the Spirit ſuffered him not.</hi> And often he purpoſed to come to the Churches he had planted. And although he ſaith in one place, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 18. I Paul would have come to you once and again, but Satan hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;</hi> yet <hi>Satan</hi> could not have hindered, had not God permitted him. So that though <hi>Satan</hi> hindered <hi>Paul</hi> ſinfully, yet God did hinder him juſtly, and for wiſe ends. Which inſtances ſhew, what vehement affections the godly may have, and that as they think for Gods glory, when yet God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſeth farre otherwiſe. So that as God may ſometimes for juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48709:161"/>
ends let falſe prophets ſpeak truth, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1. a falſe prophet or dreamer may tell a thing which may come to paſſe, and the Lord ſuffer this, to tempt and try his people. Thus <hi>Balaam,</hi> though a wicked man, and a Sorcerer, did propheſie of the happy things that were long after to come upon <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yea the <hi>Philiſtims Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Diviners,</hi> did by Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial permiſſion, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. direct to ſuch means about the Ark, and order ſtrange wayes about the milch Kine, to diſcover whether their evil was of God, or not; and all this proved ſucceſſefull. As (I ſay) God may for wiſe and juſt ends ſuffer the Devils inſtruments to foretell that which is true, and ſpeak aforehrnd of things that ſhall and will come to paſſe; ſo on the other ſide, God may ſometimes hide things from his own people, yea his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſo that they may not know them. As <hi>Elijah</hi> told <hi>Gehezi, The Lord had hid from him what the Shunamites grief was.</hi> The people of God then are to walk in all humility; and as they are not to believe every ſpirit, but try the ſpirit of others; ſo alſo they are not to believe their own ſpirit, but to try that.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>The people of God are apt to be deceived about themſelves, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe than indeed it is, and that about the frames of their heart, in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. They may be deceived in the frame of their own hearts.</note> 
                  <hi>respect of the workings of grace.</hi> As <hi>Paul received a ſentence of death upon himſelf,</hi> ſo ſometimes the children of God, a more terrible ſentence upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even that they are damned, that they are caſt-awayes, that God hath forſaken them, that they have no true grace, that all their Religion is but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Even theſe ſad decrees the godly in their temptations do receive in themſelves; but God doth not paſſe this ſentence upon them, neither doth the word of God; it is their deceived and tempted heart. Thus alſo it is for grace, they many times are deceived, thinking they can do thoſe things for God, which when put upon the trial, they cannot. As <hi>Peter</hi> thought, <hi>Though all men ſhould for ſake him, yet he would not.</hi> Oh how little do the godly know of their hearts, how mutable, how contradictory to themſelves? And all becauſe they think that is not in them, which indeed is. As there are dangerous Rocks in the Sea, when you would think by the waters that cover them all were ſafe and harmleſſe. It was this made <hi>David</hi> ſo affectionately cry out, <hi>Pſal. 19. Who can underſtand his errours? Cleanſe me from ſecret ſins;</hi> and thereupon prayeth, <hi>Keep back thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſinnes.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in thy heart there are ſecret concavities and windings, that it will put on many ſhapes and forms, ſeeming an humble heart, when it is proud, an heavenly heart, when it is earthly.</p>

               <p>WE have obſerved from the firſt part in this Verſe, <hi>That even the godly themſelves are apt to be deceived about Gods dispenſation towards them.</hi> They make falſe concluſions becauſe they erre in ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That then the People of God are deceived, when they judge of Gods</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gods people are deceived when they judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſenſe not ſaith.</note> 
                  <hi>dealings according to ſenſe and humane helps, not according to Gods power and his promiſe.</hi> And with this deceit the Children of God are frequently overtaken. How often do we find <hi>David</hi> in many of his Pſalmes thus deluded? what falſe concluſions doth he many times make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout himſelf and his affaires, and all this did ariſe becauſe he limiteth God to his own thoughts and expectations; if God remove not ſuch impediments; if his helps come not in before ſuch a time, then they conclude all is hopeleſs. It is ſaid of the people of <hi>Iſrael, that they limited the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 78. 41. And wherein did this appeare? The Pſalmiſt ſpake of it before, <hi>viz. Can God fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Table in the Wilderneſs;</hi> They grant he provided water for them even out of the Rock the ſtreames overflowed: But can he give bread, can he give fleſh alſo? Oh blind and fooliſh unbelief, Is it not as eaſie for God to provide bread as water in a dry Wilderneſs! but they limited God to their own thoughts and wayes. Now this ſinne of limiting God to ſuch humane helps and wayes as we propound to our ſelves, doth inſinuate very much into the hearts of thoſe thoſe that are godly. What was that expreſſion of <hi>David, I ſhall one day pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the hand of Saul,</hi> but bitter fruite from that bitter root? Oh how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do the people of God in their extremities ſay, <hi>Can God furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> Thoſe millions of thoughts which eat thee up in a dividing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting way, how ſhall this difficulty be overcome, how ſhall that want be ſupplyed, what if God ſuffer ſuch a thing to be, then where am I? Is not all this to ſay, <hi>Cen God prepare bread in the Wilderneſs?</hi> And this way <hi>Paul</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding thought in this trouble. The extremity is great, death is at hand, there is no way to eſcape it; but that which deceiveth him, is becauſe he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only to ſenſible helps, he conſiders the inſtruments, not the hand in which they are. This is a very ſecret inſinuating ſinne, and therefore the godly are more diligently to watch and pray againſt it, that it do not at any time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

them. Take heed of living by ſenſe, The Apoſtle diſclaimeth ſuch a life in the behalf of the godly, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. We walk by faith, and not by ſenſe.</hi> Did faith make us overlooke inſtruments, ſecond cauſes and all Creatures, how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and conſtant would the hopes of the godly man be? The Sun would alwayes go down upon a peaceable fixed, ſerene frame of heat; but when faith prevaileth and for that compoſeth the ſoul, and maketh it like the Rock, which though one wave after another fiercely aſſault, yet that abideth in the ſame place ſtill; ſo though conditions alter, though unheard cauſes and helps be mutable, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the ſame, and the promiſe is the ſame, he therefore continueth the ſame: Let then the Children of God examine and ſearch their hearts more in this particular, ſee if the cauſe of all thy diſquietneſs, of all thy troubles and feares do not ariſe from this, that thou art deceived, that thou paſſeſt falſe judgement upon thy ſelf; certainly the Devill is enemy enough to thy comfort, he indeavours to ſeduce thee and deceive thee; Do not thou joyn with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy own true and ſolid comfort. But let us proceed to examine the grounds of this truth. And</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>Becauſe the godly are apt to be haſty and too quick in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons. 1. Becauſe the godly are too haſty in their judgings.</note> 
                  <hi>theſe things.</hi> They do not conſider and well weigh all things together. They do not compare Gods promiſes and his providences together; They do not ſet Gods word and his workes together, <hi>Inſipientis eſt aſpicere ad pauca,</hi> they caſt their eyes only upon that which is diſcouraging. They look upon the dead wombe and not on the power of God, and this inconſiderateneſs makes them paſs falſe judgement, <hi>Pſal. 31. 22. I ſaid in my haste I am cut off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy eyes,</hi> and again <hi>Pſal. 116. 11. I ſaid in my haſte all men are liars.</hi> You ſee what haſty and ſudden thoughts and words may come from thoſe that feare God. Oh do not judge in thy raſhneſs, do not conclude this or that in thy haſte, but conſider, debate and compare all things together. <hi>Moſes</hi> though ſo meek a man, and the faithfull Servant of God, yet in a ſuddain haſte <hi>ſpake unadviſedly with his lips.</hi> Examine then, whether moſt of thoſe thoughts whereby thou haſt wronged God and wronged thy ſelf, have not riſen from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed haſtineſs. Thou ſaiſt in thy haſte, <hi>God forſaketh thee,</hi> thou ſaiſt in thy haſte, <hi>thou ſhalt be undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reaſon why the godly are ſo apt to be deceived in Gods admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, <note place="margin">2. Becauſe of their feare and anger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are too paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſported.</note> is becauſe <hi>they are apt to be paſſionately tranſported with anger and feare;</hi> and theſe are like a miſty foggy vapour to the Sun, that doth obnubilate it, and obſcure the light. When <hi>David</hi> doth conclude he is caſt off, and cut off, he doth not only this in his haſte, but in his paſſions alſo. It is anger maketh him ſay ſo; it is grief maketh him ſay ſo; his ſpirit is often troubled, leavened, and overwhelmed within; ſo that as when the water is bemuddied, we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſee thoſe little ſtones in the bottome, which when clear we might do: Thus it is here, when the heart is moved with fear and grief, when it is in ſad commotions, then it is no wonder if it judge erroneouſly, <hi>anima ſedendo &amp; quieſcendo ſit ſapiens.</hi> Let reaſon and wiſdome, or faith, rather meet thy paſſionate heart, as <hi>Abigal</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> and this may prevent many ſad things, which prove a trouble to thee afterwards: let it therefore be thy wiſdome when thou art ready to give this cenſure, and paſs that ſentence about thy affaires, or Gods dealings with thee, to ſtay till the heat and commotions of thy ſoul be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: fear and anger and grief, theſe are ill counſellours; erect ſuch a Tribunall in thy ſelf, as they ſay that of the <hi>Areopagite</hi> was, no man was to move the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by any Rhetoricall indeavours, leaſt thereby the judgement might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore the godly may miſjudge and conclude contrary to what God <note place="margin">3. From the want of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wiſdome.</note> intendeth, <hi>becauſe of the want of that ſpirituall skill and wiſdome,</hi> which is requiſite, when we are to inquire or determine about Gods proceedings. <hi>Clouds
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48709:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and darkneſs</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal. 29. 7. are round about his pavilion,</hi> and as his eſſence is a light that none can draw nigh unto; ſo alſo his adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do far exceed our naturall capacity, and therefore we are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his counſell and wayes. Now although this be ſo, yet as the Scripture is a Directory to us, how we are to conceive of his nature, ſo it doth alſo teach us how we are to underſtand his actions. The Scripture is a Key that doth in ſome particulars even open the deep things of God; and as <hi>Sampſon</hi> out of love did diſcloſe to <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſuch ſecret things, that none elſe did or could know, ſo (ſetting aſide many imperfections in the compariſon) doth God out of his love to his Church reveale to them, wherein his ſtrength lyeth, how ſhe may prevaile with him, which way if ſhe take, ſhe is ſure to have good acceptance with him; but to receive this, there is a Heavenly wiſdome and skill required. When the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. made a diſtinction between a naturall man and a ſpirituall as to their judgement and diſcerning, (for by the <hi>naturall man</hi> cannot be meant a weake Chriſtian, as a late Writer would have it, which is the greater wonder, becauſe thoſe of his way (I mean the <hi>Arminians,)</hi> think they ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſpeak <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. in the perſon of a regenerate man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cals himſelf <hi>carnall,</hi> and yet this Authour though of the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with them will by a <hi>naturall man</hi> underſtand <hi>a babe in Chriſt, or a weak Chriſtian.)</hi> The Apoſtle (I ſay) making this diſtinction between theſe two, ſaith, <hi>The naturall man receiveth not the things of God, becauſe they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned.</hi> Now there muſt be alwayes ſome proportion between the faculty and the object. The eye cannot ſee muſick, nor the eare heare colours, nor doth a Beaſt underſtand reaſon; but then the ſpirituall man having received the Spirit of God, he judgeth all things, and ſuch have the mind of Chriſt. There is then that Heavenly and holy wiſedome which if we receive from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, if we plow with this Heifer, we are able more exactly and certainly to judge of Gods proceedings then otherwiſe we could do; for as God giveth it to his people to underſtand the myſteries of the Goſpell, when they are hid from other mens eyes; ſo to the godly it is impart given to underſtand the wayes and workes of the Lord, that thereby they may prevent thoſe deluſions or deceits which otherwiſe they are lyable unto. Whereupon it is, that becauſe in this particular as well as in other, <hi>we know but in part,</hi> we have heavenly wiſedome but in part. Therefore it is that we do ſo often miſcarry. As in all civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement there are <hi>arcana imperii,</hi> ſecrets of ſtate, which only the wiſe favorite is admitted unto, the ſingle and credulous Subject he believeth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and appearances of things. Thus God alſo, though in a wiſe and juſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath his ſecrets in governing of his Church, he proceedeth in ſuch methods that to the judgement of fleſh and blood do appeare very improbable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ever to produce any bleſſed end; and hence it is that the carnall wiſe men of the world are ſo often taken in their own craft, and wherein they deale not only proudly, but wiſely, God is above them; whereas if they had underſtood the method of Gods proceedings, they would not have been found ſo fooliſhly to fight againſt God: but the godly have Scripture wiſedome and prudence, and therefore are not wholely in the dark, but while they follow them, are kept from thoſe bogs and pits, which others are very ready to fall into; we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſome of thoſe Divine Maximes of ſtate. As</p>

externall way as the great Potentates of the world, but in a moſt abject and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious way; and then by ſuch an accurſed and reproachfull death, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our pardon of ſinne, and acceptation with God; it hath ſo much abſurdity in it to fleſh and bloud, <hi>that to the Jewes it was a ſtumbling block, and to the Gentiles fooliſhneſs. Non pudet, quia pudendum omnino credibile, quia pror<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus impoſſibile.</hi> What the thoughts of men were about Chriſt, while working out our redemption, appeareth <hi>Iſa. 13. 2, 3, 4. There is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him, he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, we did eſteem him ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of God;</hi> So that generally all the Nations of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were deceived about a <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> yea the Diſciples themſelves were full of prejudices in this Point. This then is Gods way to do the great things of his Church, in a ſuper-humane way; So that even then when the things themſelves are not ſuper-naturall, yet the manner of accompliſhing them is wholely above nature. What therefore God ſpeaketh in one caſe to his people about the pardon of ſinne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 8, 9. is true in all the reſt of Gods adminiſtrations, <hi>My thoughts are not as your thoughts; For as the Heavens are higher then the Earth, ſo are my wayes higher then yours.</hi> By this it is plain, that a Dwarfe is as able to reach to the Heavens, as we are to comprehend Gods wayes; ſo that whatſoever God doth for thee whether body or ſoul, it is a myſtery. All will be wonderfull, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous in thy eyes; As he ſaid that was not worthy the name of eloquence which did not beget admiration in the Hearers; So the Lord accounteth of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as beſeeming his Majeſty which may not put the ſoul in admiration: poſſeſs thy ſoul with this principle, and thou wilt not be often in thy complaints; I looked for this and hoped for that, but God hath taken away that I never dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Rule is, <hi>That when God hath promiſed to do any thing for his people, yet he doth for the moſt part ſeem to go contrary to it,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>firſt,</hi> as when <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed a great Poſterity; <hi>David</hi> a Kingdome, they met at firſt with nothing, but what did make againſt theſe, ſo that his providence did ſeem to gainſay his promiſe. Now if this be not known, how quickly will the godly be deceived. The world was a great <hi>Chaos</hi> and confuſion before it was made ſo glorious as now it is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This will prevent miſtake alſo, when we conſider, <hi>That God doth uſually hide himſelfe and deny help, till every thing be deſperate, and then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to help.</hi> When the poore creple that lay ſo many years, and could not be put into the Poole, ſaid, <hi>I have no help,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt</hi> healed him; Chriſt did not provide Wine at the Marriage Feaſt till all was ſpent; <hi>Moſes</hi> cometh when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe trouble which came upon <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> being deſcribed in ſeverall ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating particulars, the next thing he intends, is to informe us about the holy and gracious end which God intended in all this. The Lords purpoſe was by this heavy exerciſe to bring <hi>Paul</hi> off from all ſelf-confidence, to weane him from all humane props, to teach him to depend upon God alone. Even <hi>Paul</hi> though ſo great a proficient in holineſs, who doth propound himſelf a patterne for others to follow, yet he needeth this ſelf-emptying, he is prone to have ſome ſecret confidence in himſelf, and therefore God as the wiſe phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian provideth ſome bitter pils to kill ſuch Wormes as theſe. The laſt ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy which grace is to deſtroy in a regenerate man, is <hi>ſelf-dependence:</hi> ſo hard a matter is it to be wholy wrought out of our ſelf, that God may be all and we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

                  <note place="margin">Two ſorts of truſt, humane and divine.</note> In the Old Teſtament the expreſſion of truſting in God is often uſed, ſo that by this word is excellently deſcribed one act of faith, whereby the ſoul ſinking as it were under difficulties doth firmely and powerfully lay hold on Chriſt. Thus the grace of faith putteth us upon the renouncing of all the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, and excellency of Men and Angels, to judge every Creature, but an eaſie ſhadow in compariſon of God. This fiduciall reſting of the ſoul on God by faith, is conſtantly to be put forth in all ſpirituals and temporals of the ſoul; it is indeed à ſpirituall and ſupernaturall leſſon, very hard for fleſh and blood to learne, which uſeth to ſwim with bladders, to walk with clutches, to have alwaies ſome humane and earthly prop or other; but yet God doth teach his people this myſtery, and acquaints them with this Heavenly art to truſt in him only, and not in any Creature. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iduciall reſting of the ſoul is made by ſome Learned Men to be only an effect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith. The papiſts make it an act of divine hope. But the moſt Orthodox do maintaine that this is an eſſentiall
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:48709:164"/>
thing in faith, yea that the greateſt perfection of faith lyeth not in knowing, or giving firme aſſent, but in confidence; and therefore by this they do chiefly define it, although it may be granted that there is alſo a confidence, or truſt which is produced by faith, as that place <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 12. ſeemeth to intimate, where we are ſaid <hi>to have confidence by faith.</hi> There is then a divine truſt, which is nothing but faith, whereby the heart of a godly man is inabled under all diſcouragements though the Fig tree faile, though the Olive tree bloſſome not, to depend upon the Lord; yea with <hi>Paul</hi> to know <hi>how to abound and to want,</hi> becauſe it is not Creatures, not this or that condition which ſupports him, but God alone, and therefore the goodneſs and power of God being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſame, his heart is the ſame. This is like an Ark to him in the midſt of waters. This truſting in God muſt be while we have meanes, as well as when we have them not; ſo when we have outward ſupports, its hard to know whether the heart doth reſt on them or God only; But of this more in the Poſitive part.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an <hi>humane truſt</hi> on confidence, and that is either in a good ſenſe or a bad ſenſe: A good ſenſe, as when the Apoſtle writing to believers, doth often profeſs his conſidence in them concerning their faithfullneſs and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>Gal. 5. 10. 2 Theſſ.</hi> 3. 4. Which confidence (unleſs <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake as having the gift of diſcerning of ſpirits) was within the bounds of humane principles, and ſo not like that confidence which a man may have about his own eſtate, as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>we truſt we have a good conſcience,</hi> for this confidence is either an act of faith, or the ſenſe of it in the ſoul. In the next place, the Scripture ſpeaketh of an humane confidence, but in an ill and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſenſe, as <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 9. When the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are ſaid to <hi>truſt in themſelves,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 19. ſome were confident they were leaders of the blind, and yet lived in evill wayes, ſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3. There is a putting confidence in the fleſh, which was a ſinne, that <hi>Paul</hi> was highly guilty, of while a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and that which did chiefly keep him off from faith in Chriſt. Now it is this humane ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full truſting in our ſelves, that the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh of, and which God would prevent in <hi>Paul.</hi> From the end of God then ſo graciouſly intended in <hi>Pauls</hi> trouble, two things are obſervable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That ſelfe confidence or truſting in our ſelves, is a ſinne ſo highly diſpleaſing to God, that he doth often chaſtiſe his people in an heavy manner</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Selfe-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a great ſinne.</note> 
                  <hi>to prevent it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That even the moſt eminent of the Children of God are very prone to truſt in themſelves.</hi> Concerning the firſt, it will be very uſefull to open the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this <hi>ſelf-truſting,</hi> it being a ſinne ſecretly involved and latent in our breaſts, that without much ſpirituall illumination and ſanctification, we are not able to know when we are guilty of it. To cleare therefore the nature of it, we are to conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That a man being a very infirme and weak miſerable thing, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſitated to trust in ſome thing or other.</hi> Our very truſting doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note <note place="margin">Propoſitions clearing the nature of ſelf-confidence.</note> our great impotency; for God becauſe he is omnipotent, wiſe, alſufficient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and happy in himſelf, therefore he cannot truſt in any, he is able to bring about what he willeth; but the rationall Creature, even becauſe a Creature, whether Men or Angels, do neceſſarily put their truſt ſome where; ſo that what the <note place="margin">1. All Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to truſt in ſomething.</note> center is to the ſtone in its motion it is reſtleſs till it come thither; Thus the ſoul of a man is in reſtleſs motions and conſtant trepidations till it fix it ſelf upon that object it truſteth to, and when it is there, the ſoul is no longer <hi>in motu,</hi> but <hi>in quiete.</hi> The very nature then of truſting, and the actings thereof do proclaime thy inability and inſufficiency. It is becauſe thou art a depending Creature, and not like God allſufficient, that thou art neceſſitated to truſt in ſome thing without.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:48709:164"/>
2. <hi>This truſting by originall ſinne is horribly corrupted and perverted as well as the other actings and powers of the ſoul,</hi> for it is wholely perverted <note place="margin">2. Our truſt is corrupted by originall ſin.</note> in reſpect of the <hi>object.</hi> We truſt in that, we ought not to do, ſetting a Creature in the roome of God, and thereby become guilty of ſecret, but horrible idolatry, and that which is the true and adequate object of our truſting, that we neglect. Inſomuch that there is no man living till regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that doth put his truſt in God, but truſteth in man, in the ſecond cauſes, in his own ſelfe. Thus like a Worme he is alwayes crawling upon the ground, and therefore if the Creatures and humane helps are removed from him he looketh upon himſelfe as undone, he hath no more hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in him. This argueth the Creature, not God, is the object of our truſting; whereas there ought to be the ſame object of faith, and truſt (I ſpeake as theſe are divine acts, not of humane faith and hope) and therefore as we may not believe in any but God; ſo neither truſt in any. Every thing that is divine and ſupernaturall, muſt be terminated upon God himſelfe. Therefore we ſay that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by her principles can teach no higher a faith then what is meer humane, becauſe the ultimate motive, in which they reſolve their belief, is the Authority of the Church, which though they would make a divine motive, yet cannot by any more then humane. This it is in Practicalls as well as Doctrinalls. A man carried by no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er principle then nature, can never truſt in any thing but a Creature. There is required as much ſupernaturall and divine influence to truſt in God, as to the exerciſe of any other grace; yea in ſome reſpects more. But man being ſo inſlaved to luſt, and to a concupiſcentiall love of the Creature ſome way or other: Hence it is that a great part of his ſinfullneſs againſt God is in perverſe and corrupted truſting, which is a ſin that doth not make ſuch a terrible guilt and noiſe in the Conſcience of a man; but it is that which is almoſt the life and vigor of every ſinne. All ſinne is therefore committed becauſe a man doth truſt in ſome Creature or other, and that admirable choice way of Evangelicall Righteouſneſſe of Goſpell juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea and the whole treaſury of riches of grace in Chriſt, is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by no ſinne, ſo much as a ſelf righteouſneſs; as we ſee in <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion: <hi>Paul</hi> was no prophane man, no lover of exceſſe and riot, his converſation was very holy and unblameable as to the Law. But his ſelfe-truſting, his ſelfe-righteouſneſſe made him a greater enemy to the Goſpell-grace, then any propaneneſs did moſt enormious men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Our truſting and confidence being naturally thus put from God the right</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Hence our truſt is placed upon many falſe objects.</note> 
                  <hi>object, hence it is that it emptyeth it ſelfe into many ſtreames,</hi> inſomuch that we have as many ſinfull confidences almoſt as there are Creatures in the world. As the Prophet told the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that his gods mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed acording to their Cities, they had as many Idols as ſuch places; ſo we may inlarge it about carnall confidence, and ſay, it is according to all the Creatures and comforts we do enjoy. Inſomuch that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid <hi>Mark 10. 24. That it was impoſſible for ſuch who truſt in rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be ſaved;</hi> the Diſciples cry out, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that every man hath ſomewhat he doth truſt in, as well as the rich man, his riches: And becauſe particular things do moſt affect, let us inſtance in ſome things which are commonly made the objects of mens truſt. And do you apply which of all theſe thy heart is fixed upon by truſting in it; for thou wilt find whatſoever it is beſide God, it will prove a lye to thee; and as they did by imſultation ſay to Chriſt, <hi>he truſted in God, let him ſave him;</hi> ſo this will be a true deriſion at the day of judgement to every man offending this way. Thou didſt truſt in the power and favour of men, <hi>let them ſave thee from Hell, let them free thee from
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48709:165"/>
damnation.</hi> Another he did put his truſt in his wealth, he boaſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that, now <hi>let thy wealth ſave thee,</hi> let that make thee eſcape thoſe everlaſting torments if they can. Every man hath ſome thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his heart he truſteth to, as the Ivy that <hi>textilis ſilva,</hi> a weaved wood, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls it, cannot grow without ſome Tree or Wall to leane upon; ſo neither can the heart of a man move or ſtirre without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon ſome Creature or other. They did in their Sacrifice for the <hi>Muſes</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> offer Ivy to <hi>Apollo,</hi> to ſhew that Learning would not or could not grow without civill incouragement; yea and the Scripture doth often compare the <hi>Church of God to a Vine,</hi> and amongſt other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons this may be one, becauſe the <hi>Vine</hi> cannot grow unleſs ſomething elſe beare it up. It is not like other Trees that beare up themſelves. Thus both the world and the Church of God, one is like a Vine, the other like Ivy. They cannot like the earth be centred on nothing, there muſt be ſuppedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments to beare them up. And becauſe a naturall man wants the life of faith, which would ſettle him on God only; therefore he runeth out to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Crutches to help himſelfe with; as ſome Creatures for want of bloud abound with many feet to help them in their motion. Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſuggeſt moſt of theſe to us. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Which is indeed the worſt of all, is, <hi>When a man truſteth in his own wickedneſſe,</hi> and beareth himſelfe up with that. There are ſuch Sonnes of <note place="margin">1. Some truſt in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Belial,</hi> ſuch monſters of impiety, that do only comfort and ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the iniquities they have committed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. 12. Some are there ſhrapely reproved for truſting in oppreſſion, in perverſeneſs, and fraud, and <hi>ſtay thereon:</hi> An expreſſion the Scripture doth much delight to uſe, when it ſpeaketh of truſting. Here you ſee becauſe men are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and powerfull, and ſucceſſefull in wickedneſſe, they are apt to truſt in this; but ſee what bitterneſſe will be in the latter end, <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. Their iniquity ſhould be like a Wall ſwelling out ready to make a breach, when a man thinketh to lean on it, preſently it falleth and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmeth him. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> alſo <hi>Pſalme</hi> 62. 10. ſpeaking of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of men even in the higheſt degree, he adviſeth them not <hi>to truſt in oppreſſion and robbery,</hi> in unjuſt and ſinfull wayes. Not to ſay with him in the Poet, <hi>Virtus mihi numen, &amp; enſis, quem teneo,</hi> My Manhood and my Sword is my God; for how often hath God by tragicall inſtances in the world made it appeare that ſuch mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> had no more then à Spiders Web to truſt in: To truſt then in ſinfull wayes is the higheſt degree of folly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture informeth of another ſinfull object we are apt to truſt <note place="margin">2. Humane power and ſtrength.</note> in, and that is <hi>humane power and ſtrength.</hi> Who would not think, that where the greateſt might is, there is the greateſt cauſe of confidence. Yet how often doth God infeeble the greateſt power, and blaſt the greateſt ſtrength, and all that men ſhould not truſt in themſelves.

thoſe who are great in the world to truſt in this more then in God, though it be ſuch a ſinne that the Scripture doth ſcarce ſpeake more terribly againſt any other. There is a politicall and civill Idolatry, as well as a ſpirituall and eccleſiaſticall one; and never did ſuperſtitious ſoules more devoutly pray to their Saints and adore thoſe Images than theſe do flatter, and attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch humane helps and powers, that may outwardly advance them. As it hath been the high impiety of ſome Potentates in the world to arrogate a deity to themſelves; no leſſe impiety is it in inferiors to depend upon them for their help as if they were Gods, and to fear to offend them more then God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ſinfull way of truſting, <hi>Is when we put our confidence in our</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Wealth.</note> 
                  <hi>wealth</hi> and riches and ſuch outward greatneſs. It is ſo hard to have riches and not to truſt in them, that what our Evangeliſt calleth having riches, <hi>Mark</hi> calleth it <hi>truſting in them.</hi> It is the mighty work of Gods grace, if thou doſt not truſt in theſe, when God maketh them increaſe, and not to ſay of them as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of their molten Calf, <hi>theſe are thy gods O Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Paul 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 17. will have the Miniſters of God deale with great zeale and boldneſs to ſuch; <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God.</hi> Though they be uncertain riches; though they make themſelves wings and flye away; yet how apt are we to put truſt in them, but God is the living God, alwayes the ſame; whether thou art living or dying, he is the ſame God; for this end <hi>covetouſneſs</hi> is called <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Col. 3. 5. There is no rich man, unleſs made humble by grace, and rich in God, but his wealth is his God. No godly man can ſo heartily truſt in God, as he doth in his wealth. <hi>Job</hi> was forced to purge himſelf from this ſinne, as that which could not ſtand with integrity. <hi>If I have made Gold my hope, or have ſaid to fine Gold thou art my confidence; If I have rejoyced becauſe my wealth was great,</hi> Job. 3. 25, 26. If <hi>Job</hi> had done thus, he muſt have acknowledged then he had been an Hypocrite. Take heed then of this cloſe lurking ſinne. It would be endleſs to reckon up all the externall objects that we may ſinfully truſt in. Therefore the next kind of ſinfull truſting to be named, is concerning that which is ſpirituall and more ſubtilly carryed on; for <hi>Paul</hi> could not truſt in himſelf after this manner, he had no outward power, nor wealth to put confidence in. It was therefore ſomething more cloſe and refined.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The Scripture ſpeaketh of that ſinfull truſting, which every natural man is in an high manner guilty of, and that is, <hi>To truſt in a mans own heart.</hi> Pro. 28. 26. <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart, is a fool.</hi> Now is not the world full of ſuch fools? Yea the Church of God? Is not every unregenerate man this fool? Can you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that his heart is naught, that he is in a ſtate of gall and bitterneſſe? What is the reaſon, that under ſo many powerfull diſcoveries out of Gods word, every hearer doth not wring his hands, ſmite upon the breſt, cry out, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, he is found out to be a ſinner, he cannot flatter and deceive himſelf any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? Whence (I ſay) is it, that moſt do ſit ſo ſottiſhly, ſo ſecurely and ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly under the preaching of the Word? Is it not becauſe they <hi>truſt in their hearts?</hi> They thank God they have a good heart, their heart is right; and all this while, if they did truly know, what true grace meaneth, and how ſhort they come of it, they would be amazed, and not able to open their mouths for their juſtification any longer. And the truth is we may call this the damning ſin. This is that which deſtroyeth ſoul and body, that though men are afar off from the way of grace, though they wallow in their luſts, yet they truſt in their hearts for all this. <hi>Prov. 21. 2. Every mans way is right in his own eyes, but the Lord poudereth the hearts.</hi> It is no matter what thy thoughts, thy perſwaſions are, but how doth the Lord account thee? Men are ſubject to a two-fold great miſtake:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:48709:166"/>
1. They miſtake about the <hi>Nature of Godlineſſe,</hi> they underſtand not what it is, how high and rare a thing that few do attain it; They take civility for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, they take the outward performance of religious duties for godlineſs; they take ſome ſudden pangs and fits of devotion for godlineſſe: Thus they judge copper to be gold. But</p>
               <p>In the next place, if they do underſtand what it is to be regenerated, how great a matter it is to be a <hi>New Creature,</hi> then ſuch is their ſelf-love, that they preſently apply it to themſelves, and do believe they are ſuch ones. For this end is that duty ſo often commended, <hi>To commune with our own hearts, to try and ſearch our own hearts.</hi> For this end we are informed of the <hi>deceitfulneſſe and deſperate wickedneſſe of the heart, that no man knoweth it, that God only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</hi> Thou boaſteſt of thy heart, thou truſteſt in thy heart. Ah poor delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded wretch, thou knoweſt not what a ſea of evil thy heart is; till grace ſhine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that dark dungeon, thou canſt never perceive the loathſome luſts that crawl there. Pray therefore to be delivered from this heart-truſting, as from hell it ſelf. It is this that is the <hi>Beelzebub</hi> ſinne. This maketh thee ſhut thy eyes, ſtop thy ears, harden thy heart; and therefore till this root be pulled up, no preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no Miniſtry can do thee any good. For the firſt thing done by converting grace, is to take away this truſting in our ſelves, and in ſtead thereof to work an holy deſpair in our ſelves. This the Spirit of God doth by convincing of ſinne through the Law: by this we ſee our ſelves a ſinfull people, and a curſed people; we are alſo convinced of our impotency and inſufficiency to help our ſelves. By this we are convinced that it muſt be the righteouſneſs of another, even of Chriſt himſelf, and not our own, that we muſt appear in, when we approach unto God. Till therefore thou art in this heart-truſting way, as long as this good perſwaſion and ſecure thoughts are in thy ſelf, thou art wholly out of the way to Heaven. This is not the way to Chriſt; if thou art not wounded, the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> will pour no oil into thee; if thou doeſt not judge all things husks, and ſeeſt thy ſelf ready to famiſh, there will no entertainment be given to thee at thy fathers houſe. Oh then that the Spirit of God would in a mighty and powerfull manner fall upon ſuch ſinfull conſiders, that he would ſhake the very foundations of their ſouls. For as long as this ſelf-truſting a bideth in thee, thy condition is incurable; if the heart be deceitfull above all things, why doeſt thou believe it above all things? Thou believeſt thy own heart more than Gods word, more than the Miniſters of God. No man doubteth of his heart, none queſtioneth or examineth his heart, and therefore cometh not to the Word preached, to have that purged, to have that cleanſed, but takes it for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principle, that his heart is good already. But how cometh it to be good? When was it made good? by nature it is full of evil, and therefore it can never be ſanctified, but by the grace of God effectually working by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Scripture inſtanceth in another object of <hi>ſinfull truſting,</hi> that <note place="margin">2. Self-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</note> is ſecret and cloſe, but alſo very dangerous, and that is in the <hi>righteouſneſſe we conceit we have;</hi> and this was the great phariſaical ſinne. This was the Camels bunch; this made them ſtand in ſuch immediate oppoſition to Chriſt, that they rejected his Perſon and Offices; They did not look upon themſelves as ſick, and therefore would not admit of a Phyſician. And oh that this ſinne had been like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd that ſprang up for a day only, and preſently was conſumed; but it is a ſinne that paſſeth from one generation to another, to put confidence in their own righteouſneſſe, to ſeek to be juſtified by the works they do; Doth not this reign in Popiſh ſpirits, in all formaliſts, in civil and moral men? Do they not look to be ſaved, to be juſtified by their works of righteouſneſſe and charity? How often doth the Scripture thunder againſt this ſinne? And indeed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48709:167"/>
well it may, for it maketh our ſelves our own Chriſts, our own Saviours. It maketh Chriſt to die in vain. Now how natural and imbred a ſinne this is, appeareth by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. <hi>They went about to establiſh their own righteouſneſſe, and would not ſubmit themſelves to the righteouſneſſe of faith.</hi> Hence becauſe this ſinne did ſo reign in the Phariſees, our Saviour ſpake that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 9. concerning a Publican humbling himſelf, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his unworthineſs, as being juſtified rather than a Phariſee; <hi>He ſpake this</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>to certain who truſted in themſelves, that they were righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> And why doth our ſaviour make thoſe <hi>bleſſed, that mourn,</hi> that are <hi>poor in ſpirit, that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe?</hi> but to ſhew in what a blaſted and curſed eſtate they are, who put any truſt in the good works they do to be juſtified by them. You ſee then by this, how dangerous and damnable a thing that common ſinne is, which every civil, every juſt and righteous man is apt to lean upon; if his eyes were opened, and his heart made tender, he would not dare to eat, or ſleep, or ſtay one night in it, as good and ſafe, as now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth it to be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another object of this ſinfull ſecret truſting, is in <hi>ſpiritual or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Church-priviledges.</note> 
                  <hi>Church-priviledges, or Ordinances, that we have more than others.</hi> This is alſo like the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> plague, which <hi>destroyeth at Mid-day, thouſands fall dead</hi> into hell, becauſe of this religious truſting in priviledges and Ordinances. They truſt in them, not regarding what holineſſe and godlineſſe God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them. How palpably did the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reprove this in the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Jer. 7. 4. <hi>Truſt ye not in lying words, ſaying, The Temple, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord are theſe; but amend your wayes, and your doings,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. When the Prophet exhorts them to repentance and reformation, then they plead, <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi> and the Ordinances. This is ſo enticing a ſinne, that in the Chriſtian Church many were perſwaded by falſe Teachers, <hi>That unleſſe they were circumciſed, and kept up the Rites of the Ceremonial Law, they could not be justified.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaketh excellently, <hi>Phil. 3. 3. We are the circumciſion, which rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> When it cometh to this, that thou doeſt not truſt in Duties, or in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but in Chriſt, in them then art thou a true worſhipper of God in the Spirit. In the ſame Chapter <hi>Paul</hi> layeth upon his own heart, what truſt and confidence he once had in his being a <hi>Jew,</hi> in being circumciſed, in his legal righteouſneſs. But when it pleaſed God to reveal Chriſt to him, What, doth he truſt in theſe priviledges any longer? No by no means, for <hi>he accounts all things but dung and loſſe in compariſon of that righteouſneſſe which is by faith in Chriſt.</hi> Is not this likewiſe an univerſal predominant ſinne amongſt Chriſtians? Do they not truſt in their Chriſtianity, in their prayers, in their Baptiſme, in receiving of the Lords Supper? They put confidence in theſe things, as if they were God and Chriſt. Neither have the Miniſters of the Goſpel leſſe work to do with Chriſtians in this reſpect, than the Prophets had of old with the <hi>Jewes.</hi> Inſomuch that then onely we come to be a ſpiritual people, when we can diſcern between Ordinances and Chriſt in the Ordinances; when we look upon Duties as the field, and Chriſt as the pearl hid in that field. When we look upon the Ordinances as the hemme of Chriſts garment we touch, but we look for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to come forth from Chriſt himſelf. But when ſhall the Miniſters of the Goſpel perſwade in this matter? How long will it be ere you put a difference between doing a duty, and truſting in a duty, between preſence at an Ordinance, and enjoying Chriſt himſelf in that Ordinance. And thus farre men deſtitute of true ſolid grace, may yet have ſome external apparent righteouſneſs, and other ſpiritual objects to reſt upon.</p>
               <p>Let us in the next place conſider, <hi>Wherein a godly man, yea an eminent</hi> Paul
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:48709:167"/>
                  <hi>may become guilty of trusting in himſelf.</hi> For ſeeing God hath taken that way for our juſtification, which is wholly to take us off our ſelves; and <note place="margin">How even a godly man may be guilty of ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by truſting, 1. In his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts.</note> the Goſpel-grace is therefore exalted, that we may be debaſed; how can it come about that the dregs of this ſinne ſhould ſtill be polluting the moſt holy man? But</p>
               <p>Firſt, Even a <hi>Paul,</hi> an eminent godly man, <hi>may ſinfully truſt in thoſe ſpiritual gifts and aſſiſtance, which God hath vouchſafed to him rather than others.</hi> This ſpark of fire will quickly kindle in tinder. Hath God given a man great gifts, great abilities in prayer, great enlargements above others: It muſt be the great work of grace to keep this man humble and low, ſo as not to truſt on them. 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Paul</hi> there declareth what wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full honour God had vouchſafed to him; he <hi>was lifted up to the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> he had abundance of revelations. So that God did in many extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wayes communicate himſelf to <hi>Paul.</hi> But could <hi>Paul</hi> be thus lifted up upon the pinacle, and his head not turn round? Can he drink of this wine, and not be giddy? No, he is in much danger; and therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what way God taketh with him at the ſeventh verſe, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be pufft up above meaſure, there was given me a thorne in the fleſh, a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from Satan to buffet me.</hi> What this was is greatly diſputed by the learned; to be ſure it was ſo heavy and burdenſome a temptation, that he prayed to God often, <hi>That it might be removed,</hi> but God would not take it off; and the reaſon is twice declared, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be puffed up above meaſure;</hi> what is this but to have confidence in his gifts and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with thoſe extraordinay diſpenſations of Gods love to him. If then the greene Tree be ſo apt to receive theſe ſparkes of vain-glory and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence, what ſhall the dry Tree do? Examine then thy ſelf, the more Gods aſſiſtance is with thee, Art thou the more lowly in thy owne eyes? Doeſt thou find an holy fear and trembling under theſe approaches of God to thy ſoul? Art thou affected at theſe wonderfull workings of God upon thee, as <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaw that great miracle about the fiſhes, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remember his own ſinfulneſſe: Or as thoſe in the Old Teſtament, who when they had any glorious apparitions of God vouchſafed to them, were ſo conſiderative of their own frailty and imbecillity, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought they ſhould die immediately? Thus the more Gods gifts abound in thee, doeſt thou the more go out of thy ſelf? And think, now I am in a temptation, the Devil is ready to puffe up with ſelf-content, and ſo to make theſe great gifts to become a ſnare to thee; to turn theſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings (as it were) of gold, into an Idol to worſhip it. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (ſay ſome) why <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is ſo often called <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> becauſe of thoſe great viſions he had in reference to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> likewiſe is once called the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> for he had great revelations concerning the Church of God. Now this Title of <hi>Son of man</hi> might greatly debaſe him under thoſe great priviledges. God ſeldome uſeth his people as great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his ſervice, but he doth ſomething or other that ſhall be like a <hi>Memento eſſe hominem.</hi> Even as that hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the ſtretching out whereof ſo many miracles were wrought, was affected with a Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that ſo the power might be given to God, and not to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus God doth wiſely mingle gifts and infirmities, diſpenſeth glorious priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and manifold chaſtiſements, that ſo the balance may deſcend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as much as it aſcends upwards: That a gracious man ſhould have that true in him, which is ſaid of the Element, <hi>In tantum aſcendit, in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum deſcendit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, A godly man may ſinfully truſt in his <hi>Graces, in his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">2. In his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:48709:168"/>
in his faith, and love of Chriſt.</hi> So that what the phariſaical man doth about his apparent and external holineſſe, the godly man in ſome meaſure may doe about his real graces. Inſomuch that many times they have not the reward of a duty, and the comfort of it in their own hearts, by ſecret pride and confidence ariſing in their heart after they have done. Therefore as pure motives are to beginne, ſo be sure in the ſame to conclude thy holy duties. Let not the Dragon devour the child as ſoon as it is borne. Take heed of that <hi>Euge Bernarde, benedicis.</hi> Thou preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt well, thou prayeſt well, thy heart hath been as thou wouldſt have it. For this is the danger of ſelf-confidence, it breedeth out of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; other ſins are committed, becauſe of ſinfull temptations; but here poiſon is ſucked from the ſweet herb, and thy evil ariſeth from thy good. No wonder then if the godly have many exhortations, <hi>To worke out their ſalvation with fear and trembling. Not to be high-minded but fear. Though they ſtand, to take heed leſt they fall;</hi> for they are apt to truſt in their own ſtrength, and their own power; and this maketh way for their fall, as in <hi>Peter,</hi> Mark 14. 31. He would not believe he ſhould deny Chriſt, though the Lord told him he would: Yea the more vehemently he affirmed he would not, though he ſhould die: Yea, ſaith the ſame Evangeliſt, <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo ſaid they all.</hi> They were all confident as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> though not ſo much; yet as <hi>Peter</hi> did groſly deny Chriſt, ſo all the reſt fled from him. By this you ſee how dangerous it is to put any truſt in our owne graces. Remember that place <hi>Ezek. 33. 13. If a righteous man truſt to his own righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. By truſting to himſelf he begins to fall.</p>
               <p>Let then the Uſe be even to thoſe who are moſt godly, to take heed and watch againſt this ſubtil ſinne that may be in thy heart, that may creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy graces, into thy duties: When thou thinkeſt thy ſelf moſt free, even then may it have the greateſt hold upon thee: Others ſinnes come like a roaring Lion, this like a gliſteriug Serpent. In other things thy ſinnes hurt thee, here thy graces and duties make thee fall. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his ſickneſſe, but in his mercies, his heart was lifted up. Come off from all duties, and all religious performances, with trembling reflections upon thy ſelf.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh theſe words in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And wherein the ſinfulneſſe of Self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence appears.</p>

                  <q>That we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe ſecond Obſervation from the words was, <hi>That even the</hi> Paul'<hi>s, the moſt holy and eminent men, are prone to this ſinne of truſting in themſelves.</hi> The great end why God did thus exerciſe <hi>Paul,</hi> it was to prevent this ſinne above any other. <hi>Paul</hi> (you heard) had no riches, no honours, no earthly power to confide in. Therefore his parts, his revelations, his graces, from theſe did ariſe his danger.</p>
               <p>But before we come to explain the Doctrine and amplifie it, one Queſtion is to <note place="margin">Whether <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh theſe words in his own perſon.</note> be anſwered, and that is, <hi>Whether the Apoſtle ſpeak this in regard of his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by a figure aſſumes the perſon of other godly men?</hi> For that is many times the cuſtom of the Apoſtle to joyn himſelf in number with ſuch, whoſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he doth not partake of, or is guilty of, as 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 31. If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord,</hi> putting himſelf in the number of thoſe who came unworthily to the Lords Supper. For <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the high degree of grace in <hi>Paul,</hi> that he thinketh <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay this, becauſe of himſelf, but by way of inſtruction to others. There is alſo a late learned Writer <hi>(Amyraldus Conſid. in 7. cap. ad Romanos, &amp; contra Gul. Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.)</hi> who thinketh it an aſſertion no way worthy of reproof, if we ſay <hi>Paul</hi> had even in this life more grace than ſome glorified Saints may have in Heaven. So that he will acknowledge <hi>Paul,</hi> if not the other Apoſtles, by a ſingular and extraordinary priviledge, to have obtained perfection. From whence he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that to expound that <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. of <hi>Paul</hi> as regenerated, as if he found the law of ſinne captivating of him, is to be highly diſhonouring of that great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and is ſignally injurious to the grace of the Goſpel. And if this be ſo, then we cannot ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake this for himſelf, but for others. For if he had attained to ſuch a ſtate of perfection, there was no danger of pride or ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. To make this his opinion good, he obſerveth. That we do not find <hi>Paul</hi> charged with any <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, any <hi>defect,</hi> after he was converted. And beſides, he propounds himſelf, as an example and a patern, which could not be, if what is ſaid in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. were true in his own perſon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enter upon the Expoſition of that Chapter. But certainly that which is here attributed to <hi>Paul,</hi> he would with the ſame fear and trembling reject, as he did the divine worſhip the <hi>Barbarians</hi> would have given to him. For although it cannot be denied, but that God did furniſh <hi>Paul</hi> with much grace, far above many others, yet that he thought not of any perfection in him, appeareth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. where he ſaith, though he knew nothing concerning himſelf, as to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48709:169"/>
the diſcharge of his publick Miniſtry in any wilfull careleſs way, yet he was not juſtified thereby, becauſe it was God that did judge him. God knew more evil and corruption in <hi>Paul,</hi> than <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was ever able to diſcover. Beſides this Doctrine of <hi>Paul's</hi> perfection would overthrow his juſtification by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, whereas he doth in a moſt affectionate manner, <hi>Phil. 3. 8, 9. Count all things dung and droſſe, to be found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſſe, but that which is by faith.</hi> Hence he ſaith, <hi>Not as if I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained,</hi> or <hi>were made perfect.</hi> Yea we read of defects in <hi>Paul</hi> after his converſion, as that which <hi>Amyraldus</hi> inſtanceth in, of the <hi>paroxyſm</hi> or <hi>bitter contention</hi> between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas.</hi> For although the Scripture, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, doth not relate who was in the fault, yet it appeareth very probably, that both had their paſſions too inordinately breaking forth at that time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that was a plain defect of a ſudden perturbation in <hi>Paul,</hi> when being ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Highprieſt, he replied as it ſeemeth in a ſinfull commotion, <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee thou painted wall;</hi> which upon information he preſently retracts. Neither can that be an excuſe which ſome make, that he did not know him to be the Highprieſt, becauſe of the corrupt cuſtomes they had about beſtowing the Prieſthood as they pleaſed. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to him that did ſit to judge him, <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou to judge me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>after the Law?</hi> Act. 23. 3. Therefore I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the beſt interpretation of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I know not, I wiſt not,</hi> is this, <hi>I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not, I minded it not.</hi> The injurious dealing <hi>Paul</hi> met with, made him forget his duty; ſo that he did not attend to this, that he was a Magiſtrate, and though a wicked and unjuſt one, yet not to be reviled. And that <hi>Paul</hi> had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption within him ready to break forth upon occaſions, appeareth 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. by Gods diſpenſation to him in that affliction, which he calleth a <hi>thorn in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>the meſſenger of Satan buffeting of him.</hi> I would eaſily yeeld to that learned man, That <hi>the thorn in the fleſh</hi> was not libidinous or luſtfull temptations, which ſome have thought, not ſo much for that reaſon which he giveth, that it is likely God would cure one ſinne by another ſinne, a leſſe ſinne by a greater. (For carnal ſinnes are ſaid to be leſſe than ſpiritual; and it is often Gods way, to cure the ſinnes of his people by letting them fall into ſinne, driving out poiſon by poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) as becauſe the Context doth more incline another way, as might be ſhewed. Yea there is one place, which puts it out of all doubt, that <hi>Paul</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both afflictions from God, and voluntary humiliations of himſelf, leſt ſparks within ſhould quickly become a flame, by that known place, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 22. I keep under my body, and bring it in ſubjection, leſt when I have preached to others I my ſelf become a caſt-away.</hi> It's an alluſion to thoſe who runne in a race, as the verſe precedent ſheweth, who did ſtrictly obſerve their diet and order, their body being temperate in all things, that they might obtain victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> in his Chriſtian race was jealous of corruption ariſing in him, and clogging of him, and ſo retard him therein.</p>
               <p>This I have been the larger upon, becauſe it maketh the more for the comfort of the godly to know, that even ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo much corruption and evil within them, as well as they, that did not the Lord uſe ſeveral means to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, were he not alwayes filing of their ruſt, cleanſing out their ſpots, they would quickly become very loath ſome and unclean.</p>
               <p>Now in the purſuing of this Doctrine, becauſe I have already opened the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this ſelf-truſting; I ſhall only aggravate the evil of it, that becauſe the godly are ſo prone to it, they may the more bewail it, and watch againſt it. And certainly the people of God doe not thinke and meditate upon the evil of this ſinne enough, you heare them complaining often of other ſinnes, they lie heavy upon their hearts, but very little of this whereas this is like ſweet poiſon, it deſtroyeth, and you feele it not. And</p>

                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:48709:169"/>
Firſt, It muſt nneds be a ſinne highly diſpleaſing God, <hi>Becauſe he doth ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely chaſtiſe his own people to prevent this ſinne.</hi> The ſharper phyſick is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">Of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſelf-confidence, which appears 1. From Gods chaſtiſing his children ſo much to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</note> the greater danger of the diſeaſe. God would not have exerciſed <hi>Paul,</hi> thus <hi>above his ſtrength,</hi> but that he might ſee his own feebleneſs and infirmity, and might accordingly truſt in God onely. Lighter and leſſer afflictions do not drive thee out of all humane props; thou haſt ſome creature-conſideration or other, that doth make thee bear up thy heart; but when God cuts every rope, and drives the ſhip into the midſt of the Sea, among waves and tempeſts, then thou art provoked to look up unto God. Let then the children of God lay to heart this ſinne more, and examine themſelves in every affliction that doth befall them. Thou many times ſayeſt, Oh that I could find out the ſinne, the <hi>Jonah</hi> that hath raiſed this tempeſt! Oh that I knew what was the peculiar corruption God would bring me in mind of by this trouble upon me! Why, try and ſearch, whether thou haſt not ſecretly truſted in thy own ſelf, or in ſome earthly hopes? Whether thy heart hath been weaned from all things? It may be there is this or that creature thou doeſt inordinately lean upon, and therefore becauſe thou doeſt not yet truſt in God with all thy heart, he doth thus imbitter thy condition to thee. Inſomuch that were the children of God in no danger of ſelf-dependance or creature-dependance, they ſhould ſeldome meet with the rod of God upon their backs. Who was a man of greater afflictions and exerciſes than <hi>David</hi> was? And who ſpeaketh more of truſting in God than he doth? This he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all his temptations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſinne is to be aggravated, <hi>Becauſe it is ſuch a ſecret, cloſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſinne.</note> 
                  <hi>imbred ſinne, it is the laſt ſinne that will be mortified.</hi> There is a difficulty of finding it out, and a difficulty of overcoming it, when it is diſcovered, and both theſe make it the more dangerous and damnable ſinne. It is difficult to find it out: This ſinne like <hi>Saul</hi> hideth it ſelf behind the ſtuff; you may ſearch and ſearch, as they did for the <hi>Spies</hi> in <hi>Rahab's</hi> houſe; but becauſe ſomething or other covereth this ſinne, therefore you paſſe it by undiſcerned. How apt are we to ſay, I do not truſt in my graces. I do not truſt in my gifts? Would you not have me to take notice of them? How can I then be thankfull to God? How can I bleſs God for them? And for my graces, Do not all Divines ſay, though they may not truſt in them, yet they may take them as comfortable ſigns of Gods favour, and thereupon rejoyce before God, yea and plead them againſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of Satan, or as an argument to God, not by way of merit, but becauſe of the gracious promiſe made by God to our graces after this manner? <hi>Hezekiah</hi> under the ſentence of death prayed, <hi>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with an upright heart,</hi> 2 King. 20. 3. Thus alſo <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>I have fought a good fight, henceforth is laid up for me a crown of glory,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7. All this is true, godly men are allowed to take comfort from their graces, and thankfully to receive the evidences of Gods love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but how hard a matter is it to ſtay there, and go no further? How diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly are conſolations from them, and confidence in them, ſeparated one from another? Even as to have riches, and not to truſt in riches, ſo to have grace, and not truſt in grace; and the rather, by how much grace is accounted a more excellent thing then wealth. As it is hard to find it out, ſo no leſſe difficult to overcome it. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſome enemies, of whom he ſaid it was, <hi>Difficilius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire, quam vincere;</hi> but it is not ſo with this corruption. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo quickly ſhake off this viper that ſticketh not to his hand, but cloſe to the heart. For as faith is therefore the moſt difficult grace, becauſe it carrieth us out of our ſelves, out of the creatures, out of all things, and fixeth the heart upon God alone: So on the contrary, this is the ſinne that is moſt eaſie, and where unto we are moſt propenſe; with the worme we crawl upon the ground; our feebleneſſe and infirmity is ſuch, that we muſt have churches to reſt upon;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48709:170"/>
and till faith be made perfect, we cannot but catch hold upon ſome reed or other, though never ſo weak.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It being an heart-ſinne, <hi>It may be frequently committed in a day, in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. 'Tis a ſinne ſoon commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                  <hi>an hour.</hi> Thy heart is alwayes in motion, it never lieth ſtill; now every time it moveth, it may put forth ſome carnal dependance or other upon the creature. Thus whereas many ſins cannot be often committed, there are many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current ere they can be accompliſhed. This may be committed as often as there is the twinkling of the eye. The air then may not be fuller of Atomes, or the ſea of water, than thy heart of carnal confidences. And certainly every time God is not made thy refuge, every time thou doeſt not reſt under his ſhadow, ſo often doeſt thou put truſt in ſomething elſe than God onely. Take heed then of that ſinne, which like the Poets <hi>Hydra,</hi> as often as thou cutteſt off their Heads, new ones ariſe again in the room thereof. That the emptying of thy heart, is like emptying of a lively and quick ſpring; the more water is caſt out, the more new cometh in immediately.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, This truſting in any thing but God, is a very great ſinne, <note place="margin">4. 'Tis a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a God.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe it is a making of the creature a God, and ſo a breach of that first Commandment, wherein we are forbidden to have any other gods, but the true one.</hi> Now how great a ſinne Idolatry is, the Scripture doth every where ſpeak. Thou therefore that abhorreſt to worſhip a ſtock, or a ſtone, who dareſt not fall down before an Idol to doe reverence thereunto: How oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en doeſt thou as bad in thy heart to the creatures? Yea many times ſome Idolaters did worſhip the true God, they did not erre in the object; onely they formed ſinfull repreſentations of God to themſelves. As the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in that Calf which they made, crying out, <hi>Theſe are thy gods, O Iſrael.</hi> And this Idolatry is not ſo bad, as when that which is not the true God, is ſet up for him, and ſo worſhipped. Now to truſt in our ſelves, or creatures, is to erre in the object, we ſet up another thing in Gods roome; Thy parts are thy God; thy graces, thy Chriſt; thy repentance, thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, thou giveſt that to thy tears, which alone doth belong to the blood of Chriſt. If then God doth ſo often proclaime his jealouſie in worſhipping of other gods, will he not alſo about truſting in any thing but himſelfe? What are the duties of the firſt Command, but to love God, to truſt in him, and to depend upon him; for he onely is the proper and adequate object of truſt, becauſe in him is infallible verity and truth. Truth of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that he can never die, but be alwayes the ſame, and truth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſo that Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away than his Word. Againe, he is willing and ready to help, he manifeſteth his freeneſs of grace to thee, whereas the Devils and the damned they cannot truſt in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no promiſe from God; yea they are ſure he will never help them. Laſtly, God is omnipotent, nothing is impoſſible to him. Therefore if thou canſt meet with a creature that is eternal, unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, omnipotent, then mayeſt thou put truſt in that; but the whole world reſpectively to God, is leſſe than the duſt of the balance, which doth not turne the ſcale one way or other: ſo neither is all the power, and all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world able to turn thy condition, to ſupply thy wants, if God doth not interpoſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>It is a fooliſh and unprofitable ſinne;</hi> as <hi>Jer. 17. Curſed is he that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. 'Tis a fooliſh and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>truſteth in man.</hi> God delighteth to blaſt all the things thou haſt hoped in; ſo that commonly we may know what we truſted too much in, by Gods removing of it; or what we would reſt upon too much, by denying us ſuch helps and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. No ſooner have we with <hi>Jonah</hi> got under a gourd to keep our ſelves from the ſcorching heat, but God cauſeth a worm to devour it: how unwiſe art thou then by reſting thy ſoul upon any comfort? Thou canſt not take a more ſpeedy way
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48709:170"/>
then to make God break it under thy arms. Even as the <hi>Aegyptiane,</hi> becauſe they boaſted of the waters of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and truſted in them; God turned them all into blood. Be ſure God will make thy confidences, thy ſorrows and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of heart, that can never enough be received, which <hi>Jonah</hi> preached from his own experience, <hi>They that obſerve lying vanities, forſake their own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Jonah 2. 8. Thoſe very mercies God had purpoſed for thee, and was in the way of performing of them, by obſerving of, and truſting in other means and helpes, thou haſt utterly deprived thy ſelf of. Even as God did with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Jerem. 2. 37. <hi>Thou ſhalt goe from Aegypt with thine hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy head, for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou ſhalt not prosper in them.</hi> Thus thou art many times bewailing the loſſe of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences.</p>

               <p>WE now come to that bleſſed and medicinal effect of the grent trouble which came upon <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as it is poſitively deſcribed.

               </p>
               <p>As we are not to believe in any but the omnipotent God; ſo neither to truſt in any beſides him.</p>
               <p>Becauſe this Text is ſo proper, I ſhall enlarge my ſelf about this great duty of truſting in God, it being of ſuch great practical concernment. For there is no grace more difficultly and rarely exerciſed than this. There is indeed much preſumption in the world, and carnal confidence, but little ſpiritual dependance upon God alone, and relying upon his promiſe and power, overlooking all means and inſtruments. That therefore we may be fully acquainted with the nature of this grace, and may accordingly exerciſe it all the day long, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Propoſitions concerning our truſting in God. 1. It is wrought by the Spirit of God.</note> moment, every time we breathe, we have need of truſting in God.</p>
               <p>Let us lay down ſeveral Propoſitions. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider, that to truſt in God is a gracious gift wrought in us by his Spirit.</hi> No man is able of himſelf, or by himſelf to reſt upon God alone, not regarding or looking above all ſecond cauſes, unleſs he be enabled thereunto by God. For to truſt is an act of <hi>faith,</hi> as is to be ſhewed: and <hi>faith</hi> that is in many places made to be <hi>the gift of God,</hi> and not accompliſhed by our ſtrength. Whereas then you have many people, whoſe mouths are full of truſting in God,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:48709:171"/>
you muſt know, that ſuch ſpeak they know not what. For none can truſt in God, but he that is enabled thereunto by the grace of God. For as <hi>Peter</hi>'s body could not walk upon the waters without ſinking, becauſe of the natural weight of the body, unleſſe Chriſt had in a wonderfull manner ſupported it. So neither can a man look higher than means, than inſtruments, unleſſe the Spirit of God lift thy ſoul up. Yea, becauſe man is ſo apt to live by ſenſe, conſiſting of a ſenſible body, and therefore the things of ſenſe moſt affect him; Hence it is, that if there be more difficulty to work one grace than another, becauſe of the more immediate oppoſition of the ſoul againſt ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more than another; We may ſay, that a man is ſooner brought to be juſt, liberal, and to performe the duties of the ſecond Table, yea many duties of the firſt Table, than this. No wonder then it be made a gracious gift of God. Hence</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>There is none can truſt in God, but ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. None but the regenerate can act this grace.</note> 
                  <hi>and are made new creatures.</hi> For as none have true ſaving faith but ſuch, ſo none have ſpiritual and heavenly dependance upon God but ſuch. It is an eaſie matter to ſay, We truſt in God, when we have the helpes and ſupply of all creatures; but when all props are removed, then to reſt on God, as ſecurely and quietly, as if thou hadſt all external abundance; this cannot be done but by a gracious heart. Therefore the unregenerate man, he doth but delude himſelf. It is not God that he truſteth in, but his wealth, his power, ſome refuge or other he hath in the creature; neither can he live upon higher principles. Hence we have that place thrice mentioned, <hi>The just ſhall live by faith.</hi> Faith is truſting there; and it is applied both to our life, in reſpect of <hi>temporal</hi> things, in afflictions, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. as alſo in reſpect of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things, eſpecially our juſtification in the ſight of God, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11. It is the juſt man then, and the ſanctified man alone, who can live by truſting on God only. Sinne is ſuch an heavy load, that it preſſeth down, and maketh a man creep upon the ground. Now all thoſe creatures that did ſo, were unclean by the Law of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This trusting, it is an act of faith; by that grace we are able to depend upon God alone.</hi> Indeed the Papiſts they make <hi>trusting</hi> to be an <hi>act of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It is an act of faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Hope:</hi> And it may not be denied, but that faith hath ſome ſuch proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble act flowing from it; but the truſting that the Scripture ſpeaks ſo much of, is plainly an <hi>act of faith.</hi> For what the Old Teſtament calleth <hi>Truſting in God</hi> ſo often, in the New it is, <hi>Believing on God, and on Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is no more than fiducial recumbency, or reſting of the ſoule upon Chriſt. Though hope therefore hath its truſt, yet faith likewiſe hath its truſt: Onely hopes object is apprehended as ſuture, and in expectation; but faiths truſting maketh the object preſent, as to apprehenſion: And therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. it is called, <hi>The ſubstance of things hoped for.</hi> By truſting then on God, we mean not that act of faith, whereby it knoweth God, nor that whereby it giveth aſſent, that there is a God; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the whole heart is drawne out to depend on God, and reſt upon him, for whatſoever good thing he ſtandeth in need of. And therefore this truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God is neceſſarily accompanied with a love of God, and endeared thoughts about him, as a gracious Father, who will mercifully provide for all our wants. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> of old, <hi>Credere in Deum,</hi> was <hi>Credendo amare.</hi> So that here is a great difference between that Hiſtorical and Dogmatical faith which many Chriſtians have, whereby they acknowledge the truths of Chriſt, and this fiducial truſting on God; for this is neceſſarily accompanied with an hearty love of, and delight in God, and cannot be ſeparated from it. Hence the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that he may tempt to deſpair, which is a ſinne oppoſite to truſt in God, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to keep the diſtreſſed ſinner in hard thoughts of God, as one who is a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48709:171"/>
provoked Judge, and will not ſhew mercy. So that as long as the heart is by theſe ſad temptations kept at a diſtance, and is eſtranged from God, it cannot ſo fully truſt in him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It's not God abſolutely conſidered that is the object of our truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. It is not God as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that is the object of our truſt. 1. As he is an infinite true and everlaſting God.</note> 
                  <hi>in him.</hi> For the Devils and damned in hell, though none need mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and help more than they doe, yet they cannot truſt in him. Therefore God <hi>relatively</hi> conſidered, as revealing himſelf to his people, is the object of their hope, and theſe Attributes or Properties do eſpecially ſuſtain our truſting in him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he is the <hi>infinite, true and ever living God.</hi> Upon this ground to truſt in Idols, to truſt in riches, to truſt in men, though never ſo great, is forbidden, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a ſin, but as a vain thing; uncertain riches they are, Idols are vanities, they are nothing. Man hath his breath in his noſtrils; and therefore it is fooliſh to truſt in ſuch things; but God being the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> even the <hi>Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting God,</hi> the <hi>ſame for ever;</hi> therefore it is that he onely muſt be truſted in. Are thy creatures a <hi>Jehovah?</hi> Have they an infinite being? Are they from everlaſting to everlaſting? No certainly; then it is Idolatry to put truſt in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is the Adequate Object of our hope, <hi>Becauſe of his Immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. As immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> 
                  <hi>on his Promiſes, as well as in his Being.</hi> Here are two particulars inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Promiſe.</hi> For if God had not revealed to us, what he would doe for us, there could not be any truſting in him. Hence Gods promiſe, and mans truſting, they muſt alwayes go together. To truſt for ſuch things he hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promiſed, is preſumption, and a temptation of God; and not to truſt for ſuch things as he hath promiſed, though they ſeem never ſo improbable or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, is to limit God, and to meaſure him according to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. This is to make truſting an act of ſenſe or of reaſon, not of faith. The Rule then of our truſting is Gods promiſe. It is not Gods In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe and Eternity as ſuch, but we muſt alſo have a promiſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though God be ſo full of Goodneſſe and Mercy, yet the damned can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truſt in him, becauſe they have no promiſe from God, that he will doe good to them. But though we have a promiſe, yet if it were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a man, who is a liar, who is inconſtant and mutable, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of what he hath promiſed, then our truſting would be weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable; but God is unchangeable in his promiſe, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away,</hi> than this gracious word of God. <hi>James 1. 17. With him there is no variableneſſe, nor ſhadow of change.</hi> God then being the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame verity, and it being <hi>impoſſible for him to lie,</hi> as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 18, 19. No wonder that our hope and truſting in God under all waves of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be a <hi>ſure and ſtedfaſt Anchor,</hi> as the Apoſtle calleth it. Why then is it, that you ſee even the people of God toſſed up and downe with ſuch uncertain thoughts and workings of heart? Why is it they have not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and quiet frame of heart all the day long? It is becauſe they let goe this Anchor; They intermit this truſting in God; otherwiſe becauſe God is the ſame, and his promiſe is the ſame, they alſo would be the ſame. You ſee then, why God is the Adequate Object of our truſt, becauſe he hath promiſed, and becauſe he is unchangeable in his promiſe. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is it to truſt in any earthly greatneſſe and power? It is but as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that paſſeth away. The Apoſtle calleth it, <hi>The faſhion of the world, 1 Corinth.</hi> 7. becauſe it is ſo tranſitory. Therefore our name we cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily uſe to expreſſe things by, is moſt abſurd and improper, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Scripture-expreſſion. For we uſe to ſay, A Kingly State, A Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an State; and ſo <hi>Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Magnatum; Status</hi> is <hi>à ſtando,</hi> and denoteth
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48709:172"/>
what is ſtable; whereas all theſe are but a <hi>Faſhion,</hi> a <hi>Shew</hi> that paſſeth away. Thus when we would expreſſe the glory of a man, we ſay, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Great State.</hi> Now no word is ſo improper as that; it is as if you ſhould call a ſhadow a ſubſtance, or ſay, the ſubſtance of a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; or as if running ſhould be called ſtanding ſtill. The Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it more fully, when <hi>Act. 25. 23. Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice</hi> are ſaid to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>With great pomp,</hi> we tranſlate; in the original it is, <hi>With a great phantaſie</hi> or <hi>apparition.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is applied in Scripture to <hi>apparitions of Spirits,</hi> which quickly vaniſh away. Now how contradictory is it to call a phantaſie a State, as if we ſhould call a feather which flieth up and down, a mountain that abideth, and cannot be removed? Seeing therefore all earthly greatneſſe is thus fluid and ambulatory, how can we put any truſt therein?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Therefore is God the ground of our truſting, <hi>Becauſe he is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. As he is omnipotent.</note> 
                  <hi>Almighty and Omnipotent, able to doe of himſelf whatſoever he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</hi> For though we had Gods promiſe to doe ſuch things for us, yet if he had not the ſupreame power to order and worke all things when he pleaſeth, but were ſubordinate to ſome higher power, then we could not truſt in him. Hence we juſtly charge the Papiſts with Idolatry for truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whom they call their hope in prayer, as alſo in the other Saints. For although they would elude by a diſtinction of truſting in one, as the primary efficient cauſe, and in one as a ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and inſtrumental cauſe, in which latter ſenſe they onely truſt in the Saints, as they would perſwade us; yet that is againſt the very nature of divine truſt, which muſt have for its object onely, that which is ſupreame and omnipotent. So that unleſſe they will diſtinguiſh of a primary God, and a ſecondary God, they cannot ſo diſtinguiſh about truſting in the ſame manner. Even as it is with the other act of faith, as it giveth a divine aſſent to any truth. The Schoolmen generally ſay, That the <hi>Ratio forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis fidei,</hi> is, <hi>Revelatio Divina,</hi> and <hi>Suprema veritas.</hi> So that we cannot with a Divine Faith believe upon any thing, but a Divine Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Thus it is in this other act of faith, which we call truſting. It muſt be a Divine Promiſe, a Divine Power, elſe we cannot put this holy and divine truſt in it. As therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Some put their truſt in their horſes, ſome in chariots, but we will truſt in the Name of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 20. 7. Thus let us; Some truſt in Angels, ſome in Saints, ſome in great men, in wiſe men; but we will truſt in the Lord. From hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is, that we do clearly confute the <hi>Socinian,</hi> who denieth the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deity of Chriſt. For if Chriſt were not God, if he were onely the beſt of creatures, yet as a creature, it would be unlawfull to truſt in him, we ſhould be guilty of great Idolatry to put confidence in him. Now it is plainly a duty <hi>to truſt in Chriſt,</hi> as well as in God the Father, <hi>Romans 15. 12. Though the root of Jeſſe, yet in him ſhall the Gentiles truſt;</hi> and that is, becauſe he is not a meer man, but God as well as man. <hi>Epheſians</hi> 1. 12. So they are called, <hi>The firſt fruits of Achaia, who firſt truſted in Chriſt.</hi> This then is a plain demonſtration of the Godhead of Chriſt, becauſe it is our duty to truſt in him. You ſee by all theſe glorious properties in God, which are the full reaſon of our truſting in him, that it is not lawfull under any nice and ſubtil diſtinctions whatſoever to put our truſt any where, but in the <note place="margin">2. The matter for which we truſt in God is the good thing we want, either ſpiritual or temporal.</note> Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As God is the object in whom we truſt, <hi>So the matter for which we are to truſt in him, is all the good things we want.</hi> There is not any one mercy, whether for ſoul or body, but we are to truſt in God alone for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:48709:172"/>
Now the good things we want, empty themſelves in two ſtreames, <hi>The ſpiritual mercies,</hi> and <hi>the temporal mercies;</hi> and we are to truſt in God for all theſe. There is not a crumme of bread, or a drop of drinke, but we are to truſt and depend on God for it. We are not to truſt in our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in our barne and ſtore, but are to lie in prayer at the throne of grace every day, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> did at <hi>Dives</hi> his gate, even for a crum of ſpiritual mercies; and they are of many ſorts:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is the ultimate and laſt end of all grace and holineſſe here, which is <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> and <hi>Everlasting Glory.</hi> The truſting in God for this, is that which ſhould keep up our hearts in all the ſtreights we are to meet with. 1 <hi>Corinth. 15. If we had hope onely in this life,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we were of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> So <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2. and 3. 7. there is the <hi>hope of eternal life.</hi> The truſting by faith, and by hope, are of ſo near union, that one may well be brought to confirme the other. Now let a Chriſtian be frequently putting forth theſe vigorous truſtings in Chriſt for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory, what heavenly, joyfull and undaunted reſolutions will it work in him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are mercies that are the meanes to lead to this end, ſuch as Justification, and Sanctification of our natures, daily remiſſion of ſinnes, and a daily preſervation in the ſtate of grace, that we may never fall away.</hi> For theſe things we are certainly to truſt for at Gods hand. We have Gods promiſe for theſe things, and who dare queſtion, whether God be thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep us to ſalvation or no? Thus remiſſion of ſinne is <hi>by faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3. Yea the life of a godly man, as to his ſpirituals and ſupernaturals, is wholly in this truſting. Thus <hi>the juſt</hi> (you heard) <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by his faith.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth aloud, <hi>That the life he did live, (Galat.</hi> 2. 20.) though in the fleſh, <hi>was by faith in the Sonne of God.</hi> Oh that this ſpiritual truth were received and digeſted more by the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly! Doe you not look more into your ſelves, then up to God? Doe you not more live in the thoughts of your owne graces, than of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Truly the right improving of this Doctrine about truſting in God, it would be like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s North-winde, to blow away the rain, to diſpell all ſinfull ſorrow.</p>

               <p>WE are treating of this choice and neceſſary duty of <hi>trusting in God,</hi> and ſeverall things have been ſpoken to acquaint us with the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; we proceed therefore, and as we have told you what is required <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> to cauſe this <hi>truſting in the Lord;</hi> from the next place let us declare what is <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> neceſſary to this duty. And for the <note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our truſting in the Lord.</note> explicating of that, there are theſe things concurrent to our truſting in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There muſt be a ſerious and powerfull apprehenſion of our own inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. A powerfull apprehenſion of our own and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inability to help us.</note> 
                  <hi>yea, and of the weakneſs of all Creatures to help us, or to do good to us;</hi> for till this foundation be laid, that all power, wiſedome, righteouſneſs, and whatſoever the Creature can affoard, is but a ſhadow, a reed, that can do no good at all, it is impoſſible that we ſhould truſt in the Lord. So that by this we may ſee the difficulty and rarity of this grace, for how hard a matter is it thus to be affected about all the meanes that are in the world, about all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we do injoy; to look upon them but as thoſe Inſtruments of Muſick, which cannot ſound any longer then they are blown into? How difficult to poſſeſs our ſoules with this principle? to look upon thy ſelf and all Creatures, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then the poore creple that lay by the Poole ſide, that could not at all help or move it ſelf? That do behold all things as <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead wombe, or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiels</hi> dry bones, unleſs the Lord quicken and give life? You may ſee this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the <hi>Church of Iſrael,</hi> when ſhe had ſmarted for her carnall confidence and dependance on outward helps, ſo as to neglect God; ſee in what an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gracious manner ſhe maketh her confeſſion to God, <hi>Hoſ. 14. 3. Asſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the workes of our hands, ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy.</hi> Oh bleſſed and ſelf-emptyed frame! here the Church repenting and turning unto God, of all the ſinnes which ſhe was guilty of, doth inſtance in her carnall confidence, as that which had moſt provoked God, and therefore ſhe doth renounce and diſavow all <hi>civill confidence and truſting; Asſhur ſhall not ſave us,</hi> &amp;c. And 2. <hi>All religious confidence.</hi> They will no more make their applications to their gods; and then here is the reaſon, becauſe in thee <hi>the fatherleſs finds mercy.</hi> By this proclaiming, that they looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſo many poore fatherleſs Children, that had not wherewith to help themſelves. If then an whole Nation do thus, how much more ought every particular Chriſtian, though great, though rich, yet reſpectively to God, to
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48709:173"/>
look upon himſelf, even as that Infant the Prophet ſpeaketh of, <hi>New borne and expoſed to danger, and no wayes able to ſuccor it ſelfe.</hi> Thus he that would truſt in God, muſt begin here and lay his foundation thus low, even as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 5. She that is a widdow indeed and deſolate, trusteth in God.</hi> We cannot come to reſt upon God, till we look upon our ſelves as deſolate and deſtitute of all humane ſuccour. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> when they loſt their famous Captain <hi>Ziſca,</hi> called themſelves <hi>Orphanes.</hi> Thus when our helps, our outward ſupports are removed, then we are driven to look up unto God, and not before. The <hi>Heathens</hi> had a cuſtome when they went into their Temples to pray, that none would go in with a Sword, or money in their Purſe; which was to denote that they did not put confidence either in ſtrength or wealth, but did reſt upon their gods for relief only. We then that are Chriſtians, who have the Word of God to be a guide unto us, ought to have low thoughts of our ſelves, and of all Creatures, accounting of them as nothing reſpectively unto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To truſt in God is required in the next place <hi>a practicall Meditation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. A practicall conſideration of Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
                  <hi>the greatneſs and goodneſs of God,</hi> how infinitely able he is, and how willing to help his people. It is the not attending to this, but the looking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the power and ſtrength of ſecond cauſes, that maketh us ſo full of diſtruſt in God. Is it not then for this reaſon, that the Scripture doth ſo often delight to repreſent the greatneſs and majeſty of God, <hi>That all the Nations are but as a drop to him; that they are leſs then nothing; that he created the world out of nothing?</hi> All this is to raiſe up the heart, that it ſhould have high and hopefull thoughts about God. This maketh <hi>David</hi> attribute ſo many metaphoricall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to God, that he is <hi>his ſtrength, his rock, his fortreſſe and ſtrong tower.</hi> Did we meditate upon theſe things; did we with <hi>Abraham</hi> not conſider the dead wombe, but the power of God, with what dependence on God, and quietneſs of mind ſhould we paſs our lives? But now we are toſſed up and down with many waves; we are like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Raven ſent out of the Ark, we know not where to ſet our feet; and all is, becauſe we do not ſettle on God; <hi>omnis motus fit ſuper immobili.</hi> The ſoul cannot move unleſs it have a ſtedfaſt and immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foundation to ſtand upon, and that is not the Creature, but God only. Thus <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 16. 8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me: becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved;</hi> and therefore <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. expreſſing this act of truſting in God, he ſaith, <hi>thou art my Lord Adonai.</hi> The word ſignifieth that which is the <hi>baſis, the foundation</hi> that keepeth up all things. Oh then let nothing be great in thy thoughts but God: <hi>Grotius Prologom. in Epiſt. ad Rom.</hi> would make that faith, which the Apoſtle doth ſo much commend in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to be nothing but an high and eminent eſteem of Gods power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that faith in this reſpect, and not the obedience of Chriſt as apprehended by faith, is by him that imputed righteouſneſs, <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo much inſtance in; But he is deceived therein, and layeth this as a foundation for his other errors about <hi>Juſtification.</hi> Though we do eaſily grant that in faith, there is a moſt raiſed and elevated apprehenſion about the majeſty, and power of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To truſt in God there is required <hi>a peculiar and particular appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. A particular appropriation of God, as our God.</note> 
                  <hi>of God to our ſoules, as our God, as our Father;</hi> to ſay as <hi>Thomas</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>my God,</hi> and <hi>my Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> in the forementioned <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2. when he had preſſed God with this Argument to <hi>preſerve him, becauſe he truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him,</hi> he declareth what his truſting is. <hi>Oh my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, thou art my Lord.</hi> Thus we are particularly to apply and to ſay, <hi>Thou art my Father, thou art my God.</hi> And this is the reaſon why the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are ſo full of diſtruſt, of deſpondent and dejecting feares. They cannot ſay, <hi>Oh my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid to God, thou art my Lord;</hi> yea
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48709:174"/>
we look upon him as a judge that will condemne.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To truſt in God there is required <hi>ſome experimentall knowledge of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. An experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods promiſes and providences.</note> to be acquainted with his former works of mercy and deliverance to them; for when we have both Gods promiſe and his providence ſeconding it, this mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to have more vigorous truſting in God, as <hi>David</hi> argued; God had delivered him from the Bear and Lion, and therefore would from the <hi>Philistin.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle at the 10. <hi>Verſe</hi> from the preſent deliverance doth argue, that <hi>he truſteth he will deliver alſo.</hi> Thus <hi>Pſal. 9. 10. They that know thy name will truſt in thee.</hi> It is for want of experience and practicall knowledge about God that maketh us ſo full of diffidence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To truſt in God, there is required <hi>a faithfull and diligent uſe of all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. An uſe of meanes.</note> 
                  <hi>thoſe meanes that God hath required;</hi> and by this it is fully diſtinguiſhed from preſumption, which many take to be in their <hi>truſting in God:</hi> for when you hear ſuch who live impenitently in evill and ungodly wayes, yet ſay they truſt in Chriſt with all their heart for the pardon of their ſinnes; they do deſperately preſume, for if they did truſt in God, they would be conſtant in the uſe of thoſe meanes God hath required, 1 <hi>John 3. 3. He that hath this hope in him, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himſelfe as God is pure.</hi> Its not their truſting in God, but preſumption, which maketh thee expect ſuch glorious priviledges, and doſt not walk in the way thereunto.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To truſt in God, there is required <hi>a ſound judgement, and right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. A ſound judgement.</note> eſpecially when we ſpeake of ſpirituall mercies, ſuch as juſtification, and reconciliation with God. <hi>Aegid. Coninck. de arteb. ſupernat. de ſpe.</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Writer maketh a threefold hope, or truſting in God. One he calleth <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi> and that is when we reſt upon God only becauſe of our own merits, and our own ſtrength; and this he doth reject, as well he may, for this is not to truſt in God, but in our ſelves. A ſecond hope he calleth <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and that is when he truſteth only in the grace of God, excluding all merits; this alſo he rejects, and thereby alſo the only hope the Scripture commends to us. The third hope he cals the <hi>Catholick truſting in God,</hi> and that is partly upon the grace of God, and partly upon our own merits, yet wrought alſo by the grace of God. But to think of merits, or to ſpeak of merits, when we come into the preſence of ſo great and holy a God, whoſe Law we break daily, and in all our beſt duties faile exceedingly, is to play the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and not the <hi>Publican,</hi> who yet only was accepted with God. The ſecond way of <hi>truſting</hi> therefore, <hi>viz. only in the grace of God,</hi> excluding all our own ſtrength, is that which is approved of by the Word of God; So that till we be ſound in our judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Point, we cannot rightly truſt in God.</p>
               <p>In the next place a ſecond main particular to cleare the Doctrine about this <note place="margin">Of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this grace of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God. 1. It is many times put for the whole worſhip of God.</note> truſting, is to conſider the <hi>excellency of their grace,</hi> that ſo we may thereby be the more exerciſed therein. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is many times put for the whole worſhip of God,</hi> becauſe he that doth truſt in God, he will be ſure to performe all thoſe other duties God doth require. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 9, 10. when the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are exhorted <hi>to truſt in the Lord;</hi> by that is meant the <hi>whole worſhip of God,</hi> even as to fear God is ſometimes alſo put for the whole ſervice of God. The excellency and dignity of the grace appeareth herein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is therefore excellent, becauſe <hi>the Lord ſo delighteth to put us upon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The Lord delighteth to put us upon the daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it.</note> 
                  <hi>the daily practice of it.</hi> Inſomuch that whatſoever he doth for his people ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpirituall or temporall mercies, they do obtaine it wholely by truſting. What is that great way, whereby we are juſtified before God, how come we to obtain this bleſſed priviledge? It is only by <hi>faith.</hi> And what is this faith, but a truſting and reſting upon Chriſt alone? So that the moſt noble and eſſentiall conſideration in juſtifying faith, is that it doth make the ſoul reſt and depend
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48709:174"/>
on the Lord Jeſus. God would not juſtifie us by any other way, by working, by doing, but by truſting; which doth greatly demonſtrate the acceptableneſs of this grace to God. So alſo for temporall mercies, that aſſertion twice or thrice uſed; <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> doth in part relate to thoſe temporall promiſes, which God maketh for the preſervation and ſupport of his people; and now God will have theſe performed to ſuch who wait on him, who truſt on him. It is not <hi>the juſt ſhall live by love, by repentance,</hi> but <hi>by faith;</hi> God therefore would have us wholly depend upon him for every mercy we have; hence we are commanded to pray for <hi>our daily bread:</hi> truſt not in thy ſtore or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; truſt not in thy labour and skill, but be every day at the Throne of grace, begging for every mercy thou deſireſt. Oh but what diſhonour is there to God in this reſpect? Doth not the rich man look more to his revennues then Gods promiſe. Doth not the Tradeſman look more to his cuſtome and his gaines then Gods power; yea the labouring man is apt to truſt in his health, and ſtrength, as if he needed not to depend upon God all the while he hath that; <hi>Sanitas pauperis est patrimonium; a poore mans health is his patrimony,</hi> his freehold, and he is apt to make it his god to truſt in. What excellency then is in this grace, when no mercy either ſpirituall or temporall can be obtained but by the exreciſe thereof. For the ſoul you muſt truſt God, and the mercies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for the body you muſt truſt God, and the mercies thereof. And obſerve the deceitfullneſs of thy heart herein, who truſteth in Chriſt for thy juſtification and ſalvation, but art full of diſquieting cares and feares about thy externall preſervation and maintenance. Oh fooliſh and unwiſe! which is greater, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation then rayment and food? and yet thou art perſwaded God will do the greater, but doubteth about the leſſer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is excellent becauſe <hi>it doth indeare God to us,</hi> and in a peculiar manner <note place="margin">3. It indeareth God to us, and engageth him for us.</note> obligeth God to look to us. For when the ſoul can ſay, O Lord, I renounce all other helps; I truſt not in any other ſupport; I leave all things to adhere to thee; this doth in particular manner ingage God to look upon us as his own, and ſo to defend us. Thus <hi>David</hi> argueth <hi>Pſal. 16. 1. Preſerve me O Lord, for I truſt in thee,</hi> Pſal. 7. 1. <hi>In thee (O Lord) I put my truſt ſave me;</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 20. it is ſaid of the Sons of <hi>Reuben,</hi> when they were in great diſtreſs, yet the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garens</hi> were delivered into their hands, becauſe they did put their truſt in God. It is alſo attributed unto <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as a great and glorious honour to him, 2 <hi>Kings 18. 5. That he truſted in the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Verſe 7. The Lord was with him, and he proſpered.</hi> Therefore the committing of our ſelves into Gods hands, is a ſpeciall way to ſecure us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The excellency of this grace is ſeen in the <hi>difficulty of it, and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Tis difficult to fleſh and blood.</note> 
                  <hi>to fleſh and blood:</hi> for if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could ſay <hi>homo</hi> was <hi>magis ſenſus, quam intellectus, more ſenſe then underſtanding,</hi> putting forth the acts thereof more then of reaſon, we may ſay much rather he is more reaſon then faith. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of it maketh the People of God oftner in diſtracting feares and cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares then in any other ſinnes. <hi>David</hi> who profeſſeth his truſt in God, yet how often tempted to difidence? <hi>Aſa</hi> a good man 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 12. is blamed that in his <hi>diſeaſe he ſought not to God, but to the Phyſicians.</hi> It was lawfull for him to ſeek to them, but becauſe he reſted wholly on them, and not on God, therefore is he thus taken notice of: ſeeing then its our duty to uſe meanes and not to expect that God will in a miraculous and immediate manner work all things for us: Hence is the great difficulty in this matter, ſo to uſe them, as not to put confidence in them. Alas all the Creatures, all the ſecond cauſes by their own power without Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, could do us no good; our cloathes would not warme us; our food nouriſh us, unleſs God command it. Hence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out of Gods mouth. Matth.</hi> 4. 4. It is not then the Creatures; it is not the conditions and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48709:175"/>
we are in, that do ſupport us, but God only. Again the difficulty is ſeen in truſting of God, becauſe Gods promiſe and his providences ſeem to go contrary to one another. The godly have the promiſes of this life, health, wealth: Peace is promiſed to them, and yet how often exerciſed with the contrary; and this maketh truſting in God the more difficult. So that what inevidence is, in reſpect of faith aſſenting, the ſame arduity and improbability, yea appearing impoſſibility is in reſpect of faith truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In all believing there is an inevidence, not in reſpect of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> dreame; and therefore would have faith defined by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, rather then by knowledge; but in reſpect of the thing it ſelf. We do not apprehend the things of faith by reaſon, as we do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall truth; and this maketh faith, as it is aſſenting, to be ſo difficult; and no leſs is it in faith, as truſting, for the difficulty and improbability, which appeareth in the things hoped for, ſo much is contrary to fleſh and blood; that we deny ſenſe and reaſon many times when we put forth faith.</p>

               <p>THis laſt clauſe is added, as a reaſon, why we are not to truſt in our ſelves, but in God; he can do that, which no King, no Emperour, no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power in the world can do, he can <hi>raiſe from the dead.</hi> By this inſtance the Apoſtle diſcovereth Gods omnipotency; for none but an infinite power can do this; even as an infinite power is required to create, to make ſomething out of nothing. Therefore the Philoſopher ſpeaking according to the ordinary way of nature, ſaith <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit.</hi> Thus it is alſo in regard of raiſing the dead, nothing but an infinite power can do this, becauſe there is another rule in Philoſophy, <hi>A privatione ad habitum non datur regreſſus.</hi> We read indeed of <hi>Eliſhah</hi> raiſing the dead Child; and ſo the Apoſtles were inabled to work this miracle, but they did theſe things not <hi>authoritativè</hi> but <hi>adprecativè,</hi> not by <hi>way of authority</hi> but <hi>prayer.</hi> Chriſt wrought theſe miracles at their prayer to him, and therefore they are ſaid to do theſe things <hi>in his name.</hi> He only then who hath an infinite power can raiſe the dead. Neither doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>who can,</hi> but <hi>who doth raiſe,</hi> ſignyfying not only Gods power, but his will and readineſs; and then in the preſent tenſe, denoting, God doth this daily and continually to his people. Now when the Apoſtle deſcribeth God thus as <hi>raiſing the dead,</hi> you muſt underſtand it of the dead <hi>literally.</hi> Thoſe that are actually dead, or as good as dead, as to any humane power, which was the caſe of <hi>Paul;</hi> and alſo dead, <hi>metaphorically,</hi> viz. ſuch who are in thoſe outward calamities and ſtreights, that they have no viſible way to eſcape out of them. In this extent you muſt underſtand the expreſſion; and from thence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is both able and willing to help and deliver his people in hopeleſſe <note place="margin">God both can and will help his people in their extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics.</note> and helpeleſſe troubles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by this expeſſion <hi>Paul</hi> doth denote the utmoſt extremity; if God can and will do the greateſt, how much more eaſie is it to him to do the leſs? Though nothing is hard to God, for he doth great things as eaſily as leſs things; ſo that this is brought in as unſpeakeable comfort to the godly who are apt to ſay; This trouble is ſo great; this ſtreight is ſo heavy, that I have no hope, my ſoul doth ſink under it. Oh remember, it cannot be more deſperate then to be a dead man, and yet God doth recover out of that condition: He doth not ſay, God that healeth the ſick; God that comforteth thoſe which are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:48709:176"/>
God who raiſeth up thoſe that are caſt down. Though in other places, theſe things are attributed to God, but <hi>God who raiſeth the dead,</hi> which is far more then the former.</p>
               <p>To proſecute this, let us conſider wherein this Doctrine is true, both <hi>literally,</hi> and <hi>metaphorically;</hi> and then how much is comprehended in the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is true in the <hi>naturall dead,</hi> that God can, and doth raiſe up ſuch to life again. In the New Teſtament we read of ſeverall perſons raiſed by <note place="margin">1. God raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally dead.</note> Chriſt to life again, ſuch a miracle and wonder, that unleſs in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the like was never heard of in the world before; for they are but Fables what ſome <hi>Heathens</hi> may record to be done amongſt them in this matter. Yea, at Chriſts Reſurrection, it is ſaid that many did riſe again, and went into the holy City. Which maketh the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. inſtance in this as one of the great wonders wrought for the Saints, <hi>That women received their dead raiſed to life again.</hi> And truly this conſideration of Gods power ſhould won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſupport us in all troubles, in all exigences; God can create, where there is nothing pre-exiſtent; <hi>I create peace;</hi> and he can alſo reſtore and give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to thoſe that are dead. Let us not then have low thoughts of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, as if he were limited in his workes, as man is; but the demonſtration of Gods power will be evidently and palpably manifeſted in that great and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Reſurrection of all that are dead, at the day of judgement. This work of God doth tranſcend all humane reaſon and power; therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, they accounted him nothing but a <hi>babler.</hi> It is Diſputed, whether the Reſurrection of the dead can be proved poſſible by naturall reaſon; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can or no, we are ſure the Scripture doth ſo poſitively and plainly affirme it, that it muſt be bold <hi>Atheiſme</hi> to deny it. Now do but conſider how great a matter it is to exerciſe faith in this particular; how improbable, yea, and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible doth it ſeem to naturall reaſon? All thoſe who have dyed ever ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo many thouſand yeares ago, who have been for ſo long a time conſumed into aſhes; All ſuch bodies which have been eaten with fiſh, or beaſts; yet God will raiſe the ſame body again, the ſame bones and fleſh again. What amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and aſtoniſhment may this raiſe in thee? yet it is clear by Scripture, God can and will do this. Oh then that the godly did more vigorouſly exerciſe their faith in this fundamentall point of Religion. What, canſt thou believe in God concerning this great and admirable truth? yet doubteſt whether he can raiſe thee out of thoſe petty and minute troubles thou art exerciſed with. When was news brought to the <hi>Pope</hi> of the murther of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> he was exceedingly affected with it in his ſpeech, in the conclave blaſpemouſly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the mercie as he thought, and among other particulars ſaid; the fact was ſo incredible, that had he not uſed himſelf to believe the high and myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous points of Religion, he could not have believed this fact. Thus he in a wretched manner; but thou maiſt in a true and godly ſenſe ſay, Oh Lord this temptation is ſo great, this trouble is ſo preſſing, I am ſo greatly overwhelmed, that did I not believe thoſe wonderfull Principles of Religion; were I not uſed all the day long to things above humane reaſon and expectation; I could not be able to beare up my ſelf in theſe extremities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Doctrine is <hi>metaphorically</hi> true, alſo God raiſeth from the dead, and that again in a twofold extremity, <hi>externall</hi> and <hi>internall, externall troubles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. God raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically dead, and ſuch who are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther externall or internall.</note> the Scripture doth delight to repreſent the great and extreame troubles of the Church, when it hath viſible help or deliverance, under the name of <hi>death,</hi> Iſaiah 26. 19. We have the Prophet comforting the Church in her deſolate eſtate. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe.</hi> It is true many Interpreters expound this, as if properly and immediately ſpoken of the Reſurrection: and it ſhould ſeem our Tranſlators underſtood it ſo, when they
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48709:176"/>
render it <hi>(together with my body,)</hi> but the context maketh it cleare: God ſpeaketh of their deliverance from captivity, wherein he calleth his people, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daver meum, my dead body,</hi> becauſe in outward appearance ſo; now the reaſon of this may be, becauſe Gods power would be to them, as the dew, to herbs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to periſh, which doth revive them. Thus their deliverance out of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity is deſcribed, <hi>Hoſea 6. 2. After two dayes he will revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi> This Text is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally and immediately to be underſtood of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> yet by conſequence it may be applyed to Chriſt; ſo that it argueth the calumniating ſpirit of <hi>Hunnius</hi> who would make <hi>Calvin</hi> to jadaize becauſe he doth not expound it as a promiſe of Chriſts Reſurrection. God will do with his Church as he did with the body of Chriſt, he would not ſuffer it to ſee corruption, but within three dayes raiſe it again. Thus ſaith the Church, though we be in a dead condition, yet he will within two or three dayes, within a ſhort time revive us again. But above all, you have a moſt evident alluſion to this <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. Where the Prophet in a viſion ſaw a <hi>Valley full of dry bones; and breath from the Lord brought ſinews and fleſh upon theſe bones, and the bones came together and lived.</hi> Now what the meaning of this parabolicall viſion is, appeareth <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. Theſe bones are the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Behold they ſay our bones are dryed up, our hope is loſt, we are cut off from all parts: but ſaith God, <hi>I will open your Graves, and you ſhall come out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe expreſſions you ſee how true the Doctrine is, that in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es extreame calamities, God raiſeth the dead; neither was this opening of the graves, and making dry bones to live once, done by God only, for that people of that time: But ſuch hath been the condition of the Church in ſeverall Ages. It hath been the dry bones, and God hath breathed life into them. Now the Child of God ſhould daily meditate upon theſe great workes of God to his People, and then he will be aſhamed to ſee himſelfe ſo much dejected about his own particular. What, thou art but one dry bone, and cannot God reſtore thee when he doth help ſo many? Can he deliver his whole Church, and not a particular Member therein? More faith in the generall affaires of the Church would facilitate thy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Come we then to <hi>internall extremities and exigences,</hi> and there in a two-fold <note place="margin">Of Gods rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> ſenſe, likewiſe we ſhall find it is God, that raiſeth the dead.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, If you conſider man in his <hi>ſtate by nature,</hi> he is wholly dead in ſinne; and therefore when God by his grace doth correct him, then he <hi>raiſeth the dead.</hi> Thus every godly man, in this ſpirituall change wrought upon him, can experimentally ſay, <hi>God who raiſeth the dead.</hi> I was ſenſeleſſe in ſinne; I was ſtupid; I felt no burden; I deſired no deliverance, but God raiſed me from the dead. Even as the Father ſaid of his Prodigall Sonne converted, <hi>this our Sonne was dead, but is alive.</hi> This expreſſion in a ſpirituall ſenſe the Scripture doth much delight in, <hi>Epheſ. 2. You who were dead in ſinne, hath he quickned,</hi> and therefore the work of grace is compared to a <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> and from this ſimilitude we juſtly urge againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> that man hath no active power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe for grace, or to turne himſelfe to God; no more then a dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> did diſpoſe himſelfe to a Reſurrection. Thou then who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureſt under many temptations about the weakneſſe of thy graces; that bewaile thy dead heart, thy dead duties, thy dead Religion; Oh thou art withered, and haſt no life in thee: Remember it is God <hi>that raiſeth the dead.</hi> And certainly if he did infuſe the life of grace into thee at firſt, when thou waſt wholly dead, can he not much more now thou art quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, recover thee out of thy decayings and ſwounding fits; he that hath
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48709:177"/>
ſpirituall life at firſt, can much more recover thee out of thy conſumptions; he that delivered from death, can much more from ſickneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another <hi>internall exigency upon the ſoul,</hi> which may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a spirituall death,</hi> and that is the ſad deſolations and terrible blackneſs, that may cover the ſoul becauſe of deſertions; God may have forſaken thee; thou maiſt not only look upon thy ſelfe as a dead man, but as a damned man. Oh this temptation when God ſets himſelfe againſt a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſoul, ſhootes his arrowes into his heart; Though a bruiſed reed break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him more, though but a ſmoaking flax, yet ready to quench it; this (I ſay) is adjudged by thoſe who labour under, it worſe then death, more bitter then death. We have a remarkable inſtance for this, in <hi>Heman, Pſalme</hi> 88. where <hi>Verſe</hi> 14, 15, 16. he maketh bitter complaint under ſoul-terrours, <hi>Why caſteſt thou off my ſoul? why hideſt thou thy face from me? While I ſuffer thy terrors I am diſtracted;</hi> and <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. he ſaith, <hi>He was free from amongst the dead, as the ſlain that lye in the grave, whom God remembreth no more.</hi> Yea his temptation doth ſo overcloud him, that he ſeemeth to queſtion the truth of our Doctrine, v. 10. <hi>Wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead? ſhall the dead ariſe and praiſe thee?</hi> This good man muſt needs be greatly dejected when he doubteth of this: for nothing is more ordinary with God, then to ſhew wonders to the dead; and therefore had he but poſſeſſed his heart with this truth, he had been able to walk on thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereas now he is ready to ſink: had he concluded, ſaying, Oh my ſoul, why art thou caſt down within thee? what, though thou art dead, yet it is God that raiſeth the dead; the dead have cauſe to praiſe him; this would have revived him. Yea God for the moſt part will not come in to help till we look upon our ſelves as dead: even as Chriſt did delay till <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead and putrifying in the grave, that ſo his glorious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er might be the more diſcovered in reſtoring of him to life. Indeed the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> might have argued, that if God ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uite forſake him, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be ſwallowed up in deſpaire; Do thoſe that deſpaire, do they praiſe thee? Do the damned in Hell bleſſe and glorifie thy name? If then in theſe ſad and bitter temptations upon thy ſoul, thou wouldſt have ſome worke to get into, then remember this truth, <hi>God raiſeth the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have heard in what particulars this Doctrine is true; let us now <note place="margin">What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the expreſſion God raiſeth from the dead. 1. That Gods own Children may be brought into helpleſs and hopeleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> conſider what is implyed in this expreſſion, <hi>God raiſeth the dead.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſuppoſeth <hi>That Gods own Children may be brought into an helpleſſe and hopeleſſe estate.</hi> They may be in a Wilderneſſe, ſo that if God doth not extraordinarily provide Manna for them, they will periſh; for you muſt know that this is attributed to God, chiefly for the godly mans ſake. For though the wicked may ſometimes be delivered from imminent dangers, yet that is by the generall providence of God, who doth in Heaven and Earth what he pleaſeth; but the godly are delivered from the ſpeciall love of God, and his peculiar promiſe to them, of being their God: So that it is in this caſe, as it is in the Reſurrection, all men ſhall be raiſed from the dead, even the wicked as well as the juſt; only the wicked ſhall be raiſed by the power of God as a juſt judge; but the godly as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, and from that ſpeciall Covenant of grace God, made with them; and upon this foundation <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 37. doth Chriſt prove the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, becauſe he <hi>is the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaack, and the God of Jacob.</hi> Theſe are mentioned rather then <hi>Noah</hi> or <hi>Enoch,</hi> when yet God was alſo their God, becauſe to thoſe the promiſe of grace was either at firſt made, or afterwards repeated. As therefore becauſe God is a God in Covenant, he will raiſe up their dead bodies; ſo from this relation he
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48709:177"/>
will raiſe thee up from thy extreame neceſſities; yet this ſuppoſeth that God though he loveth us, ſo as to deliver from evill, yet he will not alwayes prevent the evill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is implyed, <hi>That God hath an immediate ſoveraignty and domini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

When that Lord would not believe God could on a ſuddaine provide ſuch incredible plenty, he was ſeverely puniſhed for it. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alſo are taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of for limiting God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78 9. Though God had given them water, yet ſay they, <hi>Can he furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> Oh how often are we guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch diſtruſt? though God hath done thus and thus, yet can he do this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? <hi>But he raiſeth the dead,</hi> he hath a command over all things. Hence God is ſaid 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 28. To chooſe things that are not, thereby to confound things that are.</hi> So that there is no tentation, no affliction, but God can command it, and work what he pleaſeth out of it for thy good; he can raiſe up Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of ſtones, he can make Grapes to grow of Thornes, and Figs of Thiſtles.</p>

Chriſt would not turne water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wine, till all was ſpent. When the poor creeple that lay ſo long by the Poole ſide ſaid, <hi>I have no man to help me,</hi> then Chriſt healed him. It became a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe in the Church of old. <hi>In the Mount the Lord will be ſeen.</hi> God lets <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> alone till he was lifting up his hand to give a mortall blow, and then God appeareth, providing alſo a Ram in <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſtead. Thus it was alſo with <hi>Abraham,</hi> God provideth him a Son out of a dead Wombe, that ſo his glory may be more exalted; commonly a godly mans <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> his joyes and comforts are brought out of the dead Wombe of the Creatures.

For by the experience of Gods mercy to him at this time, he is encouraged to truſt in God for the future; he hath, doth, and will deliver. One favour from God is a pledge of more to come.</p>
               <p>In this verſe then we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> got above, and conquering that weakneſſe and imbecillity which he found in himſelf, and acknowledging the goodneſſe of God, and his power to him, <hi>Paul</hi> found God able <hi>to raiſe the dead,</hi> by what he had done to him in his particular.</p>
               <p>In the Text then we may take notice of,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſolemn <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of the goodneſs and power of God to him in delivering of him. And</item>

               </list>
               <p>In the former part we have his celebration of Gods goodneſſe to him; and this he aggravateth from the hopeleſneſſe and deſperateneſſe of his eſtate, which he calleth a <hi>Death,</hi> not a ſickneſſe, but a death. Yea <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, That he doth not ſay, <hi>Who hath delivered us from ſuch dangers,</hi> but <hi>ſuch death,</hi> to ſhew the extremity. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> reads it in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſuch death.</hi> The word is uſed in the New Teſtament about three times, beſides in this place; and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes applied to the great aggravation of a thing, ſo as we are to admire it, as if the like had never been heard of. Thus <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 18. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ſo great ſalvation?</hi> then which there cannot be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Apoſtle therefore in uſing this word, doth intend to aggravate the goodneſſe of God towards him, to leave out no circumſtance that may not
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48709:178"/>
heighten the mercy. It is not enough with him to take notice of the mercy, but the aggravation of his mercy; and this maketh his heart ſeven times hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as it were) in praiſing of God, than otherwiſe it would be. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the children of God do not onely acknowledge the mercy of God to them,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The children of God do not only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Gods mercies, but their aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions likewiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>but they alſo conſider of every circumſtance that may make the mercy appear greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They will take up every crumme, and the fragments (as it were) that Gods miraculous power may be more demonſtrated. They doe not content themſelves with a beholding of the mercy in the bulke, but they weigh every particular ingredient, and ſo of one mercy make many mercies. That as the godly in their humiliation for ſinne, thinke it not enough to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the general, but they endeavour to bring to minde every circumſtance that may aggravate it, and ſo make themſelves more abominable and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in their own eyes: Thus they do alſo in matter of thankſgiving; They doe not take the mercy in the groſſe, but they looke through it, and about it to eſpie out every particular that may be like a coale of fire in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes. Thus we have the thankfull <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 136. ſevering every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mercy of God to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by it ſelf, and then addeth, <hi>For his mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever: Sihon King of the Amorites; for his mercy endureth for ever. Og King of Baſan; for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> He reckoneth them up one, and by one, though he might have ſatisfied himſelf with that expreſſion, <hi>verſ. 24. Who hath redeemed us from all our enemies:</hi> But a gracious heart dare not rob God of his glory in any one benefit that he hath from him. For if he muſt ſay with <hi>Jacob, He is leſſe than the leaſt of his mercies;</hi> It is not for him to paſſe it by; for every little mercy is farre above his deſerts; to him belongeth all the curſes of the Law; whatſoever is not hell and damnation, cometh from the meer bounty of God.</p>
               <p>But let us illuſtrate this truth in the particulars, ſhewing wherein the people of God uſe to make their aggravation. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The children of God uſe to enlarge their thoughts in praiſes of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. From their own low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> 
                  <hi>from the low, weak and impotent condition they of themſelves were in.</hi> Now the more the diſeaſe is found out to be deſperate and incurable, the greater is the art and skill of the Phyſician. Thus <hi>Pſal. 136. 23. Who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred us in our low eſtate.</hi> The blackeſt Eclipſe makes the Sunnes light, when recovering, more glorious. The lower and weaker in thy ſelf, the more is God thereby acknowledged. So <hi>Pſal. 34. 6. This poor man cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Lord heard him.</hi> This aggravateth the mercy of God, that though a very <hi>Lazar,</hi> yet God would not deſpiſe him. So <hi>Pſal. 142. 3. When my Spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou kneweſt my path.</hi> Nothing is more ordinary then ſuch paſſages in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> to aggravate the goodneſſe of God towards the godly from the lowneſſe, and the impotency they were in: Oh if God had not come in at that time, I had utterly periſhed! How many low conditions have many of Gods people been in, ſometimes in reſpect of their outward, ſometimes in reſpect of their inward? yet God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them from thoſe whales bellies. Your affections to praiſe God, will be very cold and dull, till you poſſeſſe your ſoules with this thought. Oh how low was it with me! Little did others know how it fared with me, One ſtep further would have caſt me into utter horrour, and then when I could bear no longer, God ſupported me. Many <hi>Pſalmes</hi> may the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of God make (as it were) I was in ſuch a ſad temptation, but God reſcued me, <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever;</hi> I was in ſuch an outward ſtreight,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48709:179"/>
and the Lord made a way to eſcape, <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Thus the thoughts of thy low condition will greatly advance the help of God vouchſafed to thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The people of God doe aggravate the mercy of God, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. From their own ſinfulneſs</note> 
                  <hi>from the greatneſſe of the danger they were in, but alſo their ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, their unworthineſſe, that ever God ſhould caſt an eye of pity on them; and this they doe whether in temporal or ſpiritual mercies.</hi> And truly this is an excellent way to enlarge the heart in bleſſing of God; when we ſhall conſider, how unworthy we are, we that deſerved curſing, to meet with bleſſing. See this humble frame in <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 17. 16. when <hi>Nathan</hi> came to declare the good purpoſe of God towards him, in raiſing up him and his poſterity to glory; ſee how humbly, and in a ſelf-emptied manner he addreſſed himſelf to God, <hi>Who am I, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Oh Lord, what am I, and my family, the meaneſt, and moſt unworthy, and wilt thou doe this to me? Yea, as if this were a ſmall thing, thou haſt ſpoken of thy ſervants houſe, for a great while to come, and haſt regarded me after the eſtate of a man of high degree: What can <hi>David</hi> ſpeake more? Yea as it is 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. he ſaith, <hi>Is this the manner of men, O Lord God?</hi> implying, that onely God vouchſafeth mercy to ſuch as are unworthy. As then he, who would build high muſt lay a deep foundation: So he that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt God on high, muſt lay himſelfe low. And if it be thus for temporal mercies, we are not worthy of a crumme of bread; and though with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> we ſhould begg for a drop of water, it might be denied us: Then how much more in ſpiritual mercies, if God beſtow them upon us, Shall not our affections be greatly kindled in bleſſing of God? Take that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all mercies, the giving of the Lord Chriſt to believers, to worke out their ſalvation, by being made a curſe for them. How diligent is the Scripture to put an account (as it were) upon every paſſage therein? That it ſhould be as impoſſible for a believer to thinke of this love of the Father to us, and not be raviſhed with it, as for a man to carry hot coales in his boſome, and they not burn him. For the Scripture aggravateth it from the perſon who died for us, even <hi>the onely begotten Sonne of God,</hi> John 3. 16. <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne.</hi> He ſo loved it; if God would have denied any thing to mankinde, it would have been this, who would not think that he ſhould rather ſuffer all men to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then to give up his Sonne to death? And yet what aſtoniſhing love is here? Dared a poor ſinner of himſelf ever thought to have begged ſuch a thing at Gods hand? <hi>Rom. 8. 32. He ſpared not his owne Sonne.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thy heart may be amazed, more than the Queene of <hi>Shebaes,</hi> in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s glory, in meditating on this, God to give his own Sonne, his onely begotten Sonne, his Sonne out of his boſome; all which are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating circumſtances. If all the parts of the body, if all the haires of thy head, were turned into tongues, could they ſpeak enough of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God? As God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, Now I know thou loveſt me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt not withholden thy onely ſonne from me.</hi> How much more may we conclude from Gods giving his Sonne to us? As the Scripture aggravateth it thus from the quality of the perſon, ſo alſo from the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe, for whom Chriſt was thus given, and that is <hi>for enemies and adverſaries.</hi> And here is an aggravating circumſtance to enflame thy heart, <hi>Rom. 5. 6. When we were without ſtrength, when we were enemies.</hi> To die for righteous men, to die for godly men, would not have been ſuch an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation; but for ſinners and enemies, this is wonderfull. Here then is another coale from the Altar, to warme thy heart with, when thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48709:179"/>
bleſſe God for Chriſt againe. The Scripture to aggravate this mercy, doth conſider to what end he is given for us, that is, <hi>To die for us, to die an ignominious death, to be made accurſed for us, to bear the puniſhment of our ſinnes upon himſelfe.</hi> This alſo doth deeply ſinke into the heart. This is like oyle to the Chariot wheeles of the ſoul. This is like the Spirit in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi>'s wheele: Thy heart cannot be quiet, but it will exceedingly dilate it ſelf in bleſſing of God for him. That whereas he who would be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, muſt purchaſe our ſalvation at ſo deare a rate; yet he doth willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>make his ſoul an offering for our ſinnes.</hi> Laſtly, The Scripture aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this comparatively, <hi>That Chriſt did not take upon him the nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> Heb. 2. 16. He did not ſo love them; he died not for thoſe Apoſtate Angels, who yet were more glorious creatures than man; and if redeemed, would have brought God more glory; but it was for ſinfull, wretched, and weak man. But this mercy of God in Chriſt, can never be comprehended in the depth, breadth and length thereof; it being like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s waters, that will aſcend higher and higher, even till it covers our head. We may inſtance in a ſecond ſpiritual mercy, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Converſion,</hi> or <hi>Effectual Calling</hi> us out of the damned world. Oh the ſoul can never be affected with this! How much doth it delight to ſpeak of his owne vileneſſe and unworthineſſe once, that ſo the riches of Gods grace in calling of us, may be the more exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? We ſee it in <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13, 15. how willing he is to ſpeak what a <hi>blasphemous perſecutour</hi> he had once been, <hi>even the greateſt and chiefeſt of ſinners;</hi> and therefore in him the grace of God was manifeſted, even for the ages to come. To this purpoſe alſo 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. 8, 9, 10. he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, debaſing himſelf, <hi>That he was not meet to be called an Apoſtle,</hi> becauſe he perſecuted the Church of God. This diſcriminating and differing grace of God, whereby God chooſeth thee a poor contemptible worme, and paſſeth by others; many in the ſame Towne, in the ſame family, of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, yet converting grace layeth hold on thee, and not on another. As our Saviour ſaid, <hi>There were many widowes at that time, beſides ſhe of Sarepta, yet the Prophet was ſent to her alone.</hi> This comparative worke of grace, paſſing by others, and taking thee, when if God would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded Externals, or Internals, there were richer, there were more learned, there were leſſe vicious, muſt for ever enlarge the ſoule, yea ſo aſtoniſh her, that ſhe will cry out, What ſhall I ſay to theſe things?</p>
               <p>A third Aggravation of Gods mercy, that the people of God take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <note place="margin">3. From the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Gods mercies.</note> of, is, <hi>From the time, and ſeaſon that God doth it. In the fullneſſe of time God ſent his Sonne.</hi> And the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>God doth every thing beautifull in its ſeaſon.</hi> To have mercy out of its due time, is to give bread inſtead of ſtones. It is like good Phyſick, but not adminiſtred in its proper ſeaſon. Now the obſerving Chriſtian, who loveth to ſeek out the workes of God towards him, and ſtudieth all Gods diſpenſations towards him, doth in this reſpect finde out infinite matter of praiſing of God; that the Lord ſhould put off to helpe ſo long, that he ſhould let <hi>Lazarus</hi> die, and be buried; all this is to make the ſoule affected with the ſeaſonable timing of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. To have a mercy in its ſeaſon, maketh it a double mercy. Onely you muſt remember that Gods ſeaſons and fit opportunities are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes well diſcerned by us. We are ready to thinke it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if Gods help had come ſooner, if he had not deferred ſo long; but this is, as if the patient ſhould take upon him to direct the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when is the fitteſt time for the adminiſtration of his medicinal helpe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:48709:180"/>
Fourthly, The people of God aggravate their mercies, <hi>By comparing them with others miſeries.</hi> I have health, how many are in paines and <note place="margin">4. Fromothers miſeries.</note> exquiſite torments? I have ſufficiency and fullneſſe, how many <hi>Lazar</hi>'s are there that would be glad of the crummes that fall from my Table? As thoſe Lepers that were ready to be famiſhed, but unexpectedly met with full proviſion in the <hi>Syrian</hi>'s Camps, ſaid, <hi>We doe not well,</hi> (2 King. 7. 9.) <hi>let us informe the Kings houſhold.</hi> For alas they were ready to eat their own children through the famine, while theſe had all plenty. In the ſame manner mayeſt thou reflect with thy ſelf, How many are there even of the deare ſervants of God, that are naked, hungry, perſecuted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all hope? There is ſcarce any ſo afflicted, or in a low condition, but he may look upon others, who are more miſerable than he. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will greatly ſharpen thy affections to bleſſe God. When thou ſhalt compare thy mercies with others miſeries, eſpecially if you doe conſider it in ſpirituals. How many thouſands ſit in Paganiſme, and know nothing of Chriſt? How many lye roaring in hell for the ſame ſinnes, or leſſe ſinnes (it may be) that thou haſt committed? Thus if thou ſet thy ſelf to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the mercy of God from every conſideration, thou wilt finde the circumſtances will increaſe upon thee, as the widows oyl did; and thou wilt ſee thou haſt more cauſe to bleſſe Ood, then ever thou didſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend at firſt. If I ſay, thou didſt this, thou wouldſt no more complaine of the coldneſſe and chilneſſe that is upon thy heart. Nothing doth ſo much dull the heart, as reſting in generals, bleſſing God in generals, Take eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mercy as thou wouldſt ſome Watch or curious worke of Art, and view every piece, every part: or as thoſe that hehold ſome admirable Image, they are intentive to every part thereof, to obſerve the beauty, life and proportion thereof. Oh it is this, and this onely will draw out thy ſoul, and make thee have rivers of water flowing from thee! It is this that will make thee ſay with <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 32. 18. <hi>I am full of matter, the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me conſtraineth me, my belly is as wine which hath no vent, it is ready to burſt like new bottles.</hi> Thus five words of praiſe coming from an heart aggravating Gods mercy, are more effectual then five hundred in a formal general way.</p>

               <p>IN this Text we have <hi>Paul</hi> celebrating the goodneſs of God to him, in that extream trouble mentioned before, wherein was obſerved, Firſt, <hi>The holy thankefull temper of</hi> Paul <hi>ſtudying to aggravate the mercy of God.</hi> He leaveth out nothing unexpreſſed, which may not make for the great exaltation of Gods goodneſs towards him. There remaineth a ſecond Doctrine, which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the children of God are to account of the privative and preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>

                  <hi>as much as poſitive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> cals this deliverance, a deliverance from ſuch a death, ſo great a death; yet he was not actually killed, he was onely in danger of it, but becauſe (had not the mercy of God prevented) death had ſurely ſeiſed on him. Therefore this mercy of preventing death, he doth judge to be (as it were) a poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from it. That as we ſee God doth deal with his people, <hi>He accepteth of a willing mind for the deed.</hi> And <hi>Heb. 11. 17. Abraham</hi> is ſaid <hi>to offer up his onely begotten ſonne,</hi> becauſe it was in the immediate diſpoſition and preparation of his heart; he had done it, had not God prevented it: So it is here with the people of God, Thoſe mercies which keep off the dangers that are immediately iſſuing out upon us, they take as if the mercy was it ſelf poſitively done to them. Divines have a ſaying, <hi>Plures ſunt gratiae privativae, quàm poſitivae; There are more privative favours of God, than poſitive;</hi> and this they apply to ſpiritual things. And indeed if we conſider how many ſins God may keep thee from, which others fall into, how many temptations God doth preſerve thee in, which ſwallow up others, we muſt needs acknowledge, that we are no more able to reckon up theſe preventing mercies of God, than we can count the ſtars, or reckon up the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore.</p>
               <p>That this truth may affect us, and cauſe us more to imploy our thoughts in a thankfull way towards God concerning all that evil which might come upon us, if God did not interpoſe. Let us take notice of theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That there are ſome mercies God doth vouchſafe to his people, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſuppoſe evil inflicted, others do not.</note> 
                  <hi>do ſuppoſe evil to be actually come upon them.</hi> As when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was delivered out of priſon, <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the whales belly, the Lord did not prevent (which he could have done, if he had pleaſed) but ſuffered them to overtake thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his. Yea all the troubles which do befall the godly, he could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them, if he had pleaſed. He that can deliver out of them, can alſo ſtop them from coming: but God out of wiſe ends, both relating to his own glory,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:48709:181"/>
and the good of his people, doth bring theſe exerciſes upon them. Then on the other ſide, There are mercies, which <hi>do not</hi> ſuppoſe evil actually to come upon us, but ready and prepared to fall on us, if the Lord did not forbid. That as we ſee it was with the Angel, when he had his drawn ſword, and was ready to ſtrike <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with the plague, as well as other places, the Lord did merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly command the Angel to put up his ſword. Now no doubt but <hi>David</hi> did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this preventing mercy, this ſtopping of the plague, to be as great, as if they had been delivered in the midſt of it. For in regard of the preparation to this judgement, they were but as ſo many dead corpſes. So that the people of God are of too narrow and ſtreightned a ſpirit, when they look onely to what troubles they have been in, and God hath delivered them. Oh conſider further, how many might have fallen upon thee, yea would certainly have bruiſed thee, had not the Lord kept them off!</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe preventing mercies do empty themſelves in a two-fold chanel.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Two ſorts of evils, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which the mercy of God prevents.</note> For they are either <hi>Temporal evils,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual evils,</hi> that theſe mercies do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto: and thus preventing mercies do compaſſe us about all the day long; what evil might not have fallen upon thee every moment? This diſeaſe, that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualty, ſuch a ſudden and unexpected calamity. Inſomuch that thou canſt not hear of any miſery, fallen upon any living, but it alſo might have come upon thee. Doth any ſit mourning and wringing their hands, crying out, <hi>O ye that paſſe by, ſee if there be any afflicted with bitterneſs, as I am!</hi> And is not this thy caſe? Is not thy houſe a houſe of mourning, for dead fathers, or dead husbands, as well as others? Is not all this from the preventing mercy of God? The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chanel in which theſe mercies may be diſcovered, is, <hi>In ſpiritual things.</hi> And certainly here we may cry out alſo, <hi>That they are more than can be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</hi> For what ſinne, what temptations, what terrours and troubles of heart, what wounds and gaſhes of ſoul do any of the godly fall into, and thou mayeſt not alſo be plunged into the ſame? Who maketh thee to differ? <hi>Why muſt not the branch ingraffed in, inſult over that which is broken off, but take heed and tremble?</hi> Is it not becauſe God may break off thoſe alſo? Oh then with bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and melting hearts, acknowledge and ſay, O Lord, what would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me, if left to ſuch a paſſion, if forſaken in ſuch a temptation! Why is it that I have not the guilt, the condemnation that others lie under? Is it not becauſe thy goodneſs did keep me? Even as <hi>David</hi> was preſerved in reſpect of that buſineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the men of <hi>Keilah,</hi> he asketh of God, Whether they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him into <hi>Saul</hi>'s hands, and God telleth him, they would certainly do it; thereupon <hi>David</hi> will not commit himſelf to them. It is thus often in reſpect of thy ſoul; if thou go to ſuch a place, if thou art put into ſuch a temptation, if placed in ſuch a condition or relation, God knoweth that this would prove a ſnare to thee, it would be a ruine to thee. Therefore the Lord doth ſo order by his mercy, that thou ſhalt not come into that condition. <hi>Divines</hi> have one kind of grace, that they call <hi>Gratia praeveniens,</hi> which doth <hi>prevent us,</hi> it cometh upon us before we have any thought, any will or deſire about it. As God ſaid, <hi>He was found of thoſe, that ſought him not.</hi> And truly ſuch preventing grace we do not only need at our firſt converſion, but all our life long, as much as our daily bread. Grace muſt prevent our mind, our will, our affections; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome ſinne, ſome luſt or other would immediately faſten upon us. Let then the godly ſoul remember, what a deep and vaſt ocean this is of preventing grace, the bottome whereof thou canſt never dive into. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>By the grace of God, I am what I am;</hi> ſo ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> he might have added, <hi>By the grace of God, I am not, what I am not.</hi> It's the grace of God, that thou art not a withered tree, a barren wilderneſs. It is the grace of God keepeth thee from Hypocriſie and from Apoſtaſie; what a ſinner and evil wretch thou art not, it is wholly by the grace of God.</p>

Thirdly, Although the godly do thus judge of preventing mercies, as well <note place="margin">3. The godly are o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about theſe prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies.</note> as of poſitive mercies, yet becauſe we are apt to account of mercies by ſenſe, and feeling we have, hence it is, <hi>That the godly are exceedingly-forgetfull many times about preventing mercies.</hi> It is often ſaid, We never prize a mercy till we want it. How precious is health to a diſeaſed man, eaſe to a tormented man? And ſo alſo we never account any evil grievous, but while we feel it, while it is upon our backs; and thereupon we are moſt ſenſible of ſuch mercies, which do take off this burden from us. Thus it is indeed, becauſe we judge of all things according to our ſenſe; but if we did let judgement work, then the godly ſoul would be likewiſe greatly enlarged for the keeping of evil, as well as removing of it. The evil we never felt, yet becauſe ready to come upon us, had not the mercy of God kept it off, is affectionately taken notice of by that ſoul, which delights to ſearch out the works of God towards it. The godly ought not be ſo bruitiſh, as to be taught only by thorns, or to be like the horſe which muſt have alwayes the bit and bridle. <hi>Preventing mercy</hi> is as real a mercy as a poſitive one. God is as truly good in keeping of evil from thee, as removing of it: Shall God therefore loſe ſuch of his glory and honour, becauſe thou wilt judge only by ſenſe?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That therefore the children of God may know, <hi>It is their duty to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their duty to go further in praiſe and thankfulneſs for theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, then uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they do. 1 Whatſoever evil is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted that we have deſerved, is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged a preventing mercy.</note> 
                  <hi>go further in the way of praiſe to God, then uſually they do.</hi> Let them conſider theſe enſuing rules, concerning preventing mercies. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Perſwade thy ſelf of this, <hi>That whatſoever evil thou haſt deſerved by thy ſinnes, and is not brought upon thee, look upon this as a preventing mercy, and be affected wit it as much as with any poſitive mercy.</hi> And truly this very particular may be like a live coal from the Altar to warm and purifie thy heart. For haſt thou not deſerved all the curſes threatned in the Law. As ſoon as ever as thou haſt ſinned, may not the Law of God immediately challenge thee, take thee by the throat, and hale thee to hell? Well if ſo, conſider this preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, that keepeth thee from them. Mayeſt thou not truly ſay, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the deſerts of thy ſinne, not onely the God who deliuereth from ſo great a death, but alſo ſo great an hell, and ſo great a damnation? Were not thy heart like a clod of earth, like a ſtone, how greatly wouldſt thou be affected in this particular, ſaying, It's the Lords mercy I am not in the grave; It's the Lords mercy I am not roaring in hell; for the Law curſeth me, I have tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that, there is nothing keepeth off the execution of that dreadfull ſentence, but the meer mercy of God? And therefore if thou wert dead and raiſed again, if damned in hell, and yet delivered out: Would not thy mouth and heart be filled all over with bleſſing and praiſing of God? Why not then when God keepeth thee out of this deſtruction every moment? It's obſerved as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Gods great power and mercy, that the waters of the ſea being higher than the earth, yet they are ſo checked and bounded by the power of God, that they do not overflow the earth. This is the meer preventing mercy of God. Inſomuch that <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Inhabitants of the earth are as wonderfully preſerved from destruction by the ſea, as the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were in their paſſage to</hi> Canaan, <hi>when the waters ſtood like walls on both ſides.</hi> And thus it is in any mercy we enjoy, if we conſider what the Law threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, how that curſeth, what we have deſerved. It's a wonder of wonders that every houre we doe not fall into hell. Therefore if thou findeſt thy heart not affected with theſe preventing mercies, lay this particular cloſe to thy ſoul. <note place="margin">2. Whatſoever evil fals upon others, and not upon us, 'tis a prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider, That whatſoever evil doth actually fall upon any other in the world, and not on thee, this is a preventing mercy.</hi> Is another ſick, and not thou? Is another poor, not thou? This is a privative mercy. For what reaſon can there be given of thy difference from others, but onely the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48709:182"/>
mercy of God; he killeth and maketh alive, he maketh poor, and maketh rich. So that all theſe things are diſtributed according to the wiſdome and pleaſure of God. If ſo, how then cometh it about, that thou eſcapeſt ſuch a miſery, and another doth not? Afflictions riſe not out of the duſt, neither doth preferment and honour. God then giveth a cup of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and joy, or a cup of gall and wormwood to drink off. Now then look about thee, and behold how many ſit in darkneſs, and have no light; how many are bereaved of ſenſes, of their underſtandings, and of all comforts, even brought to be like <hi>Dives</hi> in hell, asking for a drop of water, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain it; but it is light in thy <hi>Goſhen,</hi> while darkneſſe with others. Doth not this preventing mercy melt thy ſoul? Art thou not made of braſſe and iron, if thy preſervation from the miſeries of others, eſpecially the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and ſinfull wayes, do not exceedingly move thee? How canſt thou carry ſuch live coales in thy boſome, as theſe thoughts are, and not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflamed with them?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Acknowledge this likewiſe, <hi>That whatſoever God in juſtice might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Whatſoever evil God juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may, and yet doth not inflict, 'tis a preventing mercy.</note> 
                  <hi>upon thee, and yet doth not, therein is alſo preventing mercy.</hi> It may amaze us to conſider, what objects of wrath, and examples of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance there have been in the world. <hi>Cain</hi> was in the beginning of the world; God made him like an Anatomy-lecture for all ſucceeding evil men to beware of his impieties. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alſo, God ſaith of him, <hi>For this cauſe have I raiſed thee up;</hi> or as ſome contend, <hi>I have kept thee alive in the midſt of thoſe many judgements, that deſtroyed round about him,</hi> Rom. 9. 17. Exod. 9. 16. Now let any thankfull, godly heart meditate on theſe Hiſtories. Conſider theſe examples, Why waſt not thou a <hi>Cain,</hi> thou a <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Why ſhould not God make thee an example of his wrath, to be a pillar of ſalt to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon others, as well as others are to thee? Oh the depths of this preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, how incomprehenſible and unſearchable are they! Muſt not this aſtoniſh thee to think, that whatſoever God in the way of wrath hath done to any man in the world, the ſame God might have done to thee, and no more have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee than he did them? Account this therefore upon the riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that theſe things have not come upon thee. Look upon all ſuch mercies, as priviledges and exemptions. God doth otherwiſe with thee than many others; he puniſheth their ſins, he animadverteth their iniquities, they are howling under his anger, and thou art preſerved. It is true, God is no accepter of perſons; and therefore <hi>Cain</hi> cannot expoſtulate with God, why he did not make him <hi>Abel;</hi> nor can <hi>Pharaoh</hi> complain of God, becauſe he was not <hi>David;</hi> nor yet can <hi>Judas</hi> find fault with the Lord, becauſe he was not <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe as <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerveth well, in things of meer bounty and liberality, there cannot be any accepting of perſons, ſeeing that if no munificence to any at all were extended; there was no cauſe of grievance. And thus it is wholly with God, he is no debtor, nor obliged in any way of juſtice to man; and therefore <hi>if he do what he pleaſeth with his own, Shall thy eye be evil, becauſe he is good?</hi> So that God muſt needs be juſtified by theſe different diſpenſations; onely thou whom the Lord doth thus ſpare and exempt from his way of wrath, look upon it as ſo much mercy; as if God had ſaid to the damned in hell, as he did to <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the grave, <hi>Come forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Not onely whatſoever God doth in a way of juſtice, but alſo in <hi>a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential way</hi> (which we call chance) <hi>bring upon others, and not upon thee, this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. What evils God brings upon others in a providential way, and not upon thee, it is of his prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy.</note> 
                  <hi>alſo is a preventing mercy.</hi> We reade, that if a man were cutting a tree, and the Axes head fall off, and kill another, it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord delivered that man into his hand,</hi> Exod. 21. 13. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 19. Although to man there be ſuch a thing as contingency and caſualty, ſuch ſad things fall out many times, that no wiſdom of man could fore-ſee, yet in reſpect both of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:48709:182"/>
and providence, no thing is uncertain to God: and therefore thoſe caſual things are as much under Gods providence, as neceſſary things. What can be more inconſiderable than an hair? Yet <hi>not one of theſe fals from the head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods will.</hi> This being ſo, let a godly man but think with himſelf, How many caſual murders, how many ſudden and unexpected deaths have many met withall in the world? What ſad changes have been made in families, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by ſome accidents, that were never thought of, yea it may be the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall out again? Now then caſt up thy accounts, ô child of God, ſee how much is owing to God in this very particular: Count every ſuch preventing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as much as a poſitive one.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Whatſoever the frailty, imbecillity and weakneſſe of man would caſt him</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Whatſoever mans own weakneſs would caſt him into, and yet God keeps it off, is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting mercy.</note> 
                  <hi>into, yet God keepeth thee from; know this is a preventing mercy.</hi> Man is ſuch a poor, infirm creature, ſo many things are requiſite to keep up life, that we may wonder every man who goeth from home alive, is not brought home dead at night. How is it that this candle under ſo many puffs of wind, is not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed? How cometh this ſpark of fire to be kept in a ſea of water? So that thou mayeſt juſtly account every dayes life a reſurrection from the dead. Had man no other keeper, or preſerver than himſelf, both in temporals and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, every moment he would die, both in ſoul and body. Say then, O Lord, my heart is affected, my ſoul ſuffers violence within me! If I had the tongue of men and Angels, I could not exalt thy mercy according to the nature of it; I look upon my ſelf, as brought out of the grave, yea brought out of hell many times a day. The Papiſts have an opinion about the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> That ſhe was borne in no original ſinne, nor ever committed any actual ſinne; and therefore (ſay they) when ſhe called Chriſt her <hi>Redeemer,</hi> that is, by way of preſervation, not that ſhe was actually redeemed from ſinne, but would neceſſarily have been, if Chriſt had not preſerved her. This is an abſurd and a fooliſh opinion. Onely in the general we may ſay, That <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he is a <hi>Redeemer</hi> to his people by actual deliverance; ſo alſo by preſervation, Chriſt is a Saviour, in that he preſerveth thee from the ſinnes thou wouldeſt have committed, as well as thoſe thou haſt committed. Yea all thoſe iniquities thy heart, thy temptations would have carried thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if God had not prevented, thou art to bleſſe God for, as well as the pardon of thoſe ſinnes actually committed by thee. Fill thy ſoul therefore with the meditation of theſe things: Say, Lord, what I am is a mercy, what I am not is a mercy! The removing of evil is a mercy; the keeping of it off is likewiſe a mercy.</p>

But by Chriſt we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a deliverance, we are ſet free faom the power our former ſinnes had over
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48709:184"/>
us, <hi>Col. 1. 13. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſſe, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated us into the kingdome of his deare Son.</hi> You ſee what the condition of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is till converted, it is ſaid to be under the <hi>power of darkneſs.</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable is the miſery of all unregenerate men, who are thus the Devils pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners bound hand and foot, that they are not able to ſhake off any one ſinne they are accuſtomed unto, neither are they willing to be delivered? They do not mourne and groane after a Redeemer; how inlarged therefore ſhould the heart of a godly man be, when he ſhall ſee himſelf thus delivered? the time was I could not give over my looſe and wanton wayes; I could not part from my prophane and wicked Companions; the time was, I hated ſuch as feared God, I could not indure any holy ſtrictneſs, any family-duties. The time was when the cares of the world did lord it over me, ſo that neither praying, or hearing, or any holy Ordinances had any influence upon me, being ſo greatly inſlaved to thoſe earthly thing: but now bleſſed be God the ſnare is broken, and my ſoul like a Bird is eſcaped; I can now run with delight in the wayes of God. Oh how bleſſed a deliverance is this, to be ſaved from thy former impieties, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of thy old blindneſs and wickedneſs? Seeſt thou not in what miſerable bondage many perſons are intangled in by their luſt? They have ſome convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome terrors upon their conſcience; they cry out, oh that they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall into ſuch ſinnes again, and yet upon every temptation hideouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe again. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> before his full converſion to God, complained of this captivity exceedingly. If therefore God hath delivered thee from thy former unregenerate eſtate; if he have made thee a new Creature, then know the goodneſs of God towards thee, is more then ever can be comprehended by thee. It cannot enter into thy heart to conceive of the fullneſs thereof: But becauſe this deliverance is not compleate and perfect in this life, as appeareth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth of a captivity, ſtill he was plunged into, he breaketh out at laſt into that affectionate expreſſion, <hi>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Oh how bleſſed and happy will that day be! when thou ſhalt have no more thornes in thy ſide, or rather in thy heart; no more <hi>Jebuſite</hi> to diſquiet thee, but all ſinne with the effects thereof ſhall be wholly dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>ſpirituall deliverance in reſpect of the continuall temptations</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. From tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to ſin and apoſtacy.</note> 
                  <hi>we meet with in this world, to draw us to ſinne, and to make us turne the back upon God.</hi> That we may alwayes have Gods protection herein, we are taught to pray, even as often as for our daily bread, that he would deliver us from evi'l, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 4. and herein the Lord doth vouchſafe more daily delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to us, then we can poſſibly apprehend. Every condition, every mercy, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very affiction, would be a temptation to us, to allure us to ſinne; did not the Lord daily deliver; What is it that keepeth thee from the Apoſtacy of others? and ſo from the wounds and gaſhes of Conſcience, which uſually fall thereupon; but the meer delivering mercy of God? Thus you ſee in how many particulars God doth deliver his people; but as the Doctrine is; It is not enough for God to deliver once, unleſs he doth it daily, continually, never withdrawing his arme from under us; and the grounds of the neceſſity of continued mercy are theſe. <note place="margin">Why 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary God ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as well as give them to us. 1. Becauſe we cannot conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them our ſelves.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe of our utter inability and impotency to continue the ſame to our ſelves.</hi> If the Lord doth beſtow ſuch and ſuch deliverances on us, leaving us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to our ſelves, that we by our own wiſdome and power ſhould preſerve our ſelves; Alas, This would immediately prove a ruine to us; for we can no more continue the deliverance, then we could procure it at firſt; he that hath delivered, muſt be the ſame that doth deliver. Its not God that hath delivered, and then we who do deliver. Humble thy ſelf therefore thankfully under all Gods mercifull diſpenſations towards thee; ſay, O Lord I depend on thee for
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:48709:184"/>
daily bread, for daily grace, for daily pardon, for daily preſervation. The ſame infinite power and wiſdome is required to uphold thy mercy, as was at firſt to bring it to thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This continuance of mercy is requiſite not only from our naturall imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <note place="margin">2. Becauſe of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs.</note> but alſo our <hi>morall unworthineſs;</hi> So that though the Lord hath delivered once and twice; yet we are apt to be ſo unthankfull and forgetfull, that the Lord may deliver no more. Oh how often do we forfeit the good mercies that God vouchſafeth us? how often have we provoked him to take away his good gifts from us? but it is his mercy, it is his goodneſs to continue them unto us. Every day thou doſt enough to make God take away all he had beſtowed upon thee. Even as when he had made man, who revolted from him, and was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into obſtinate wickedneſs; it is ſaid <hi>Gen. 6. It repented him that he made man, and it grieved him at the heart;</hi> an expreſſion to humane capacity, to ſhew how unworthy a Subject man was now become of all that love, God had ſhown to him; and maiſt thou not feare, when thou lookeſt upon thy own bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs and unworthy dealings with God? that God doth repent that ever he thus honoured thee; that ever he thus bleſſed thee; that ever he vouchſafed ſuch grace to thee, and ſo take all from thee? Take <hi>Saul</hi> for an inſtance, how many perſonall favours did the Lord beſtow on him? but at laſt God quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke him becauſe of his Hypocriſie ane Rebellion; If therefore we conſider how forgetfully and wretchedly we walk under Gods mercy, we may evidently ſee, that if the goodneſs of God did not continue them, as well as at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them, we ſhould quickly be ſtript of all. How many not perſons only but Churches, for want of the continuance of Gods mercies are of Gardens become a very Wilderneſs? Is God to the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as to the <hi>Churches of Aſia</hi> as he was once? ſo that the demerit which is upon us after mercies received, our not improving of them for God, may provoke God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the good he hath done for us to bring all evill upon us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is neceſſary the Lord ſhould continue mercies and deliverances, as <note place="margin">3. Becauſe our dangers and temptations continue.</note> well as at firſt vouchſafe them to us, <hi>becauſe our dangers, our temptations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</hi> They that renew their diſeaſe daily, muſt alſo renew their Phyſick. They that fall daily, need to be raiſed daily. Iterated troubles, need iterated delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. It is true, there are ſome mercies that cannot be iterated any more, the benefits of them may, but not the mercies themſelves. Thus the Creation of the world was at firſt, and it would be abſurd to pray that God would create it. So the Incarnation of Chriſt, this was once done, that it cannot be done any more; Gods Predeſtination likewiſe of his people was from all eternity; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be iterated. But then there are other mercies which are duely to be continued, yea, often to be repeated; ſuch as pardon of ſinne, the daily quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and excitings of grace. It is true, ſome have of late affirmed, that ſinne is pardoned from eternity, and that we cannot pray for the pardon of it; onely we may for the ſenſe and aſſurance of the pardon. But it is abſurd to think a ſinne ſhould be remitted, before committed; and therefore as we multiply to offend, ſo God is ſaid to <hi>multiply to pardon.</hi> Do not therefore think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that God hath once ſanctified thee, once juſtified thee; and therefore thou needeſt not the help and daily ſuccour of Gods grace; for if the ſame grace did not preſerve and keep thee, which did at firſt regenerate thee, thou wouldſt fall into thy old <hi>Chaos</hi> thou waſt once in: We do not therefore fall from grace, becauſe man of himſelf, if abſolutely conſidered, cannot throw himſelf out of it; but becauſe Chriſt will looſe none of his Members, and therefore he keepeth them united to him. Even as we ſee it is in regard of the world, it is not enough that God did once make it; but it is neceſſary he ſhould conſerve and uphold it, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. he keepeth up all things by his power; hence conſervation is called a Creation, and they require the ſame infinite power for
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48709:185"/>
the one as as the other. Thus it is alſo in the work of grace, in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to ſalvation. An infinite power, an infinite love muſt begin continue, and at laſt conſummate. Thus by theſe Reaſons you ſee, why God that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, doth continue to deliver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. To reprove that unthankfullneſs and unworthineſs which is in moſt men. It is God that daily continueth their mercies to them. It's he that upholds the world. He that keeps up the meanes of grace, and yet we take theſe things as if they were ſo many debts to us. How little doth it enter into our hearts to think if God withdraw it, if God give but a blaſt, all the world is but as duſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. It is God that hath continued thy health, thy ſtrength to thee this day more, this week more. It's God continueth thy relations alive: had not he done thus, all had been broken in pieces before this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe.</hi> 2. Doth God thus <hi>continue deliverances and mercies?</hi> then take heed of abuſing them, to wantonneſs, of not improving them faithfully for God; if he continues thy health and life, lay it out to the Author thereof; if he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth thy wealth, and greatneſs, let not the Devill and ſinne have the fruit of it. Oh how unjuſtifiable is it? what curſes and torments do we deſerve, if when God continueth our mercies, we thereby ſerve the Devill? if the Devill did create thee; if the Devill did preſerve thee; if you did live and move in him: then you might pay him out of his own. But oh the patience of God that ſuffereth ſo many wretched ſinners to advance the Devils Kingdome by thoſe good gifts he hath given to them.</p>

You ſee then, whom <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the object of his <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>trusting,</hi> even <hi>God</hi> alone. So that we may not place our hope, in the wiſdome or power of men, nor in Angels or Saints; no not as inſtrumentall cauſes to procure us our good we need: For a divine hope, muſt have for the motive of it divine truth and goodneſs; divine power and help, as well as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting faith, muſt have divine revelation and authority.

               <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>object truſted for,</hi> and that is, <hi>a temporall deliverance.</hi> For although God himſelf, and eternall glory, be the principall objects of our hope and truſt; yet temporall mercies may be the ſecondary and leſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, as they relate and conduce to this eternall bleſſedneſs; for ſome are only to hope for outward mercies, as thereby our everlaſting happineſs may be advanced. Now <hi>Paul</hi> by truſting in God for future deliverances, doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuppoſe that he ſhall alwayes be in dangers; and that though once or twice delivered, yet new temptations will aſſault him. But though they do, he is not diſheartned. The ſenſe he hath had of Gods former mercies, doth incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him for the future: for ſeeing God doth help his people becauſe they are in miſery, becauſe they are his, and he ſtands engaged in promiſe to them: Theſe Reaſons being perpetuall and alwayes the ſame, no wonder if Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and deliverances likewiſe be continuall.

               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was delivered by God, and therefore he truſteth <hi>he will deliver him.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> alſo argued, 1 <hi>Sam. 17. 37. God had delivered from the Lion and the Beare, therefore alſo he truſted, he would from that uncircumciſed Philistian.</hi> Hence at another time <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>He will remember the mercies of God, which had been of old;</hi> for theſe are of great uſe to keep the heart fixed for the future. We have the Apoſtle expreſſing his confidence even concerning others, and that in the matter of grace and ſalvation; from the foundation God had already laid that ſpirituall building, <hi>Phil. 1. 6. Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will performe it till the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That this hope in <hi>Paul</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from one deliverance to another, was fixed upon, may ſee alſo at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 18. Where having acknowledged Gods mighty prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to him, in that he was delivered from the mouth of the Lion, he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>And the Lord ſhall deliver me from every evill work;</hi> How greatly then are the people of God to be reproved for their diffidence and diſtruſt,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48709:186"/>
who though they have the Word of God, and the workes of God; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, and the providences of God, upon which to quiet their ſoules concerning all events to come: yet upon every new trouble, are as much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and perplexed, as if they had never heard or known any thing of God.</p>
               <p>To amplyfie this, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That although we have in many particulars found the goodneſs and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons clearing the truth. 1. Though we have oft had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods goodneſs, yet every new trouble is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtartle us.</note> 
                  <hi>power of God to us; yet every new trouble, every new danger, is ready to ſtartle us, and to overwhelme us.</hi> The Children of God in any new exerciſe, are many times as much to ſeek, as if they had never been delivered by him. They are ready to feare, that now they ſhall ſink, though hitherto preſerved. Even as <hi>David,</hi> when his truſt in God was weakned, then he cryeth out, <hi>He ſhould one day periſh by the hands of Saul:</hi> all the great deliverances vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to him, did not ſettle his heart for the future. Such therefore is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and ſinfull fear which is ready to ſurprize us upon any new tryall, that we are apt to think; though God hath done thus and thus for us, yet can he conquer this temptation? can he help out of this trouble? This is worſe then all the reſt; and can he deliver herein? Even as we read of the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> who had the experience of ſo many wonderfull preſervations, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous mercies beſtowed on them in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 78. 19. yet queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, <hi>Whether he could furniſh a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> and <hi>Verſe 20. Behold he ſmote the rock, and waters guſhed out; can he give bread alſo?</hi> See here how they limited God to one mercy, and to one deliverance; now this was ſo great a ſinne, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cals it, <hi>a ſpeaking against God,</hi> it was <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> and he addeth an aggravating particular, <hi>yea, they ſpeak againſt God;</hi> as if this were a greater ſinne then all their former rebellions; therefore it is ſaid <hi>Verſe 21, 22. The Lord heard this, and was wroth, his fire was kindled againſt Jacob: Becauſe they truſted not in his ſalvation.</hi> Oh let this be a dreadfull inſtance, never to be forgotten by thee! how often doth thy heart ſay ſuch things? God hath hitherto maintained; hitherto delivered; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto provided for me, and mine: But, <hi>Can he furniſh a Table in this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? can he ſuccour me in this exigency that I am now plunged in?</hi> Oh take heed of ſuch diſtruſting thoughts! it is, ſpeaking againſt God, it is a kind of blaſphemy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Although the promiſe of God be ground ſure enough for us to truſt in,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Though the promiſes be ſufficient grounds for our truſt, yet experiences do much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote faith.</note> 
                  <hi>yet ſuch is our weakneſs and infimity, that experiences and ſenſible props do wonderfully promote our faith.</hi> Could we act purely and perfectly from Divine Motives, the promiſe of God would be as good to us, as all the experiences in the world; for it is the word of him that cannot iye; and therefore nothing of ſenſe or reaſon, is ſo ſure as that of faith. But becauſe we conſiſt of a body as well as a ſoul; therefore as in other things, God doth condeſcend to our weakneſs, ſo here alſo. The Sacraments and miracles were vouchſafed by God, to confirme our faith; not that they add any certainty to the promiſe, or can bring more authority to it; only in reſpect of our imbecillity, ſo they became helps to our faith. Thus alſo when we have great and glorious promiſes, which may abundantly ſatisfie us, ſo as to conquer all diſtruſtfull and perplexing thoughts, yet experiences joyned with theſe; and when we ſee him fullfilling with his hand, what he hath ſpoken with his mouth; this doth greatly add to our confidence. It is true, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 20. 29. to <hi>Thomas,</hi> who would not believe, unleſs his ſenſe did confirme him, <hi>Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed,</hi> becauſe ſuch do give more glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God; As <hi>Abraham</hi> did, who regarded the power of God, reſting on that, and conſidered not <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead Wombe: Yet they are not wholly caſt off by God, who do believe, and ſee alſo. There is a time when we are
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48709:186"/>
to truſt in God before we can have experience of Gods diſpenſations; ſuch is the time of converſion. Then the ſoul being brought into the deeps of the Lord, then it being in divers and ſad agonies, the heart is more difficultly brought to truſt in God. For all things are then new; the ſoul never felt ſuch temptations before; it was never in ſuch feares before; it is ready to cry out, Never any was in the like caſe with me; what will be the iſſue of thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things, in his ſoul he knoweth not. All this diffidence is, becauſe at that time the believer had no experience of Gods dealings; is not acquainted with the deep myſteries of God in bringing us to ſalvation, our with the depths of Satan, who indeavours our deſtruction. But when once the ſoul cometh to have more experience of Gods works upon it ſelfe, and is more acquainted with the wayes of God, then he comes to hope, whereas before he was ready to caſt off all in deſpaire. If then God hath from year to year, trained thee up in many experimentall diſcoveries of ſoul-mercies, and body-mercis; how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable wilt thou be, if thou are ready to be ſhaken, and to looſe thy hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every new trouble? Gods promiſe ſhould be enough to thee; thou needeſt no more: If a man that is faithfull and able ſhould aſſure thee ſo much, thou wouldſt reſt contented. How unworthily then doſt thou deale with God, when his word and his workes put together, yet do not compoſe thy heart? Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member! is not he the God, that created light out of ſuch darkneſs, as did once cover thy ſoul? Is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>exerciſe truſt in God for the future.</hi> Not only to bleſs God for the mercies we have, and do enjoy; but alſo as confidently and ſecurely to truſt in God for all future things, that ſhall befall us, as if we did for the preſent enjoy what we could deſire. We ſhall find, that for want of this truſting in God for the future, all our anxieties and diſquietneſs doth ariſe. We do continually create unto our ſelves conſtant moleſtations of ſpirit, becauſe we make ſuppoſitions about the future. What if I ſhould be brought into ſuch a condition? What if ſuch a ſad eſtate ſhould befall me? What if I be left unto ſuch a temptation? Thus conſtant conflicts about what is to come, taketh off all joy and thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for what we have for the preſent. Therefore it is a ſpeciall duty in the Children of God, to be acting dependently upon God for the future, as well as for the preſent. Our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 25. doth by ſeverall choiſe and precious Arguments, indeavour to conquer that ill temper in his Diſciples, who were ſo ſollicitous what would befall them to morrow? how they ſhould be cloathed hereafter? how they ſhould live hereafter? Therefore the Child of God is to live with as much joy and contentation in reſpect of future things, as if they were preſent; And this is the reaſon why the promiſes in Scripture are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſed in the paſt tenſe, and ſometime in the preſent, becauſe we are alſo as much aſſured of every good thing promiſed, as if we had it already in our hands.</p>

                  <note place="margin">4. The future good things that we are to truſt in the Lord for, are both ſpirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> 
                  <hi>spirituall and temporall things.</hi> Though <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes here, and <hi>David</hi> many times in his <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of truſting in God for temporall mercies; yet the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent objects of our confidence, is to be eternall glory, or the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in that ſtate of bleſſedneſs. Hence it is, that God is ſometimes, and everlaſting glory is ſometimes called <hi>our hope,</hi> becauſe in the expectation of theſe things the ſoul is daily ſupported: and certainly if the Husbandman would not plow, but in hope; neither would a believer indure all thoſe ſufferings and afflictions for Chriſts ſake, but for this hope. This truſting, to have that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy hereafter, and to be for ever with God, ſhould be put forth more
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:48709:187"/>
vigorouſly by us. And we ſhould find it excellently uſefull to weane us from the world, and to make us part with our deareſt comforts for Chriſts ſake; yea, as was hinted before, we are to truſt in God, for theſe temporall things only as they are conducible thereby, becauſe God hath promiſed them no further, and ſo farre they are abſolutely promiſed; inſomuch, that we may no more diſtruſt God about temporall things, ſo farre as neceſſary to our ſalvation, then we may of ſpirituall and gracious things: which may detect the Hypocriſie of our hearts, whereby we pleaſe our ſelves, as if we truſted on Chriſt for our juſtification, and the ſalvation of our ſoules; when in the mean while we diſtruſt him about a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of bread, or a drop of water. Only it may be doubted, how <hi>Paul,</hi> and any godly man can truſt in the Lord for the future about temporall mercies, ſeeing <note place="margin">Object.</note> that the godly may many times be without them; and if <hi>Paul</hi> be delivered once by God, it dothnot follow, he muſt be delivered every time; for then he could not have ſuffered Martyrdome as he did at laſt. And why might not <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> have truſted in the Lord to be delivered? Which if they had done, it had been a falſe truſting. To this ſome ſay, that we are as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely bound to truſt in God for every <hi>temporall</hi> mercy, as we are for any <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and that it is meerly for want of faith or truſting in God, if we have not all the temporall deliverances we ſtand in need of. If a man dye of the Plague, they will ſay it is for want of faith in God; but although no doubt the People of God are greatly to be blamed for their diffidence, and for want of truſting in God, they looſe many outward mercies; yet becauſe temporall things are not ſo abſolutely promiſed as ſpirituall, therefore there cannot be ſuch an abſolute truſting for them. Others they ſay, that we are to truſt in Gon <hi>conditionally.</hi> To reſt upon him for this and that mercy, with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if God will. But thoſe that ſay we are abſolutely to pray for temporall things, theſe muſt alſo conclude, that we are to truſt in God for them abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly likewiſe: and therefore ſuch do not like that expreſſion, by way of <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when we pray for theſe outward mercies. They like not this expreſſion in prayer, <hi>Father, if it be thy will, recover ſuch an one that is ſick.</hi> They think this is not a Prayer, becauſe from a conditionall ſuppoſition, no certain thing is inferred.</p>
               <p>Others therefore they conclude, we are to pray abſolutely for temporall things, (and by conſequence we may alſo add to truſt for them,) only there ought to be a ſubmiſſion in our ſpirits, that if God give us not our requeſts, we yield our ſelves up to his holy and wiſe will. Thus with them, though we may not pray with condition, yet we ought with ſubordination; and happily they that ſpeak of this condition, mean no more then ſubordination. There is then a difference about truſting in God concerning <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi> things; eternall glory abſolutely, and ſuch a meaſure of grace as will beare us through all temptations, that we ſhall not totally and finally be overcome by them, <hi>temporall</hi> things with <hi>ſubordination,</hi> yet ſo farre alſo abſolutely ab out them, that no good thing ſhall be withheld from us; ſo that we may with <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8. in an holy triumph profeſs, <hi>That neither life nor death; neither things preſent, or things to come, ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>EXperiences of Gods mercies that are paſt</hi> (you heard) <hi>may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to truſt in God for the future.</hi> Now although much hath been ſaid concerning this neceſſary grace of <hi>truſting,</hi> with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>in which,</hi> and <hi>for which,</hi> yet ſome particulars are to be added for further explication. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>There are ſome peculiar and proper motives, to truſt in God, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. There are motives to truſt in God from both the perſonal and general privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</note> 
                  <hi>were the perſonal priviledges of ſome believers onely; and there are general common ones, which do belong to all the godly.</hi> As for example, when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in that place mentioned before, argued, that God who had delivered from the <hi>Bear and Lion,</hi> would alſo from that <hi>uncircumciſed Philiſtim.</hi> We may very well conclude, that <hi>David</hi> in that particular act, had ſome immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and divine inſtinct upon his ſoul, whereby he was raiſed up to truſt in God aſſuredly, for that particular deliverance. And this is the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe of the manner he did encounter <hi>Goliah</hi> with, going out againſt him, <hi>In the Name of the Lord,</hi> with a <hi>ſling,</hi> and <hi>ſtones</hi> out from the brook. By which preparation it is plain, that <hi>David</hi> was therein guided by immediate revelation. And happily <hi>Paul</hi> in this act of truſting, which here he profeſſeth, he might have more than the general and ordinary promiſes, which all the people of God have to relie upon, there might be ſome ſpecial aſſurance and revelation vouchſafed to him, that he had more work to do for God, that all his enemies could not for the preſent take away his life. Therefore he addeth, <hi>He will yet deliver;</hi> not <hi>alwayes,</hi> but <hi>as yet</hi> he will, till he had finiſhed his courſe, and fought the good fight of faith, he was called to. Thus we read that <hi>Paul</hi> had a viſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 9, 10. while he was at this <hi>Corinth,</hi> commanding him, <hi>Not to be afraid, for no man ſhould ſet on him to hurt him.</hi> Thus many of the people of God in former times, they had immediate revelations, and perſonal diſcoveries made to them, whereby they were called to believe in God for ſuch a particular temporal mercy, and that every way abſolutely. But then</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>common, general mercies,</hi> which are to work upon all the godly; and ſuch are thoſe univerſal propoſitions revealed in Gods word, whereby we are antidoted againſt diffidence and diſtruſt in any eſtate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. So that although thou haſt not that peculiar revelation made to thee for ſuch mercies, as thoſe Ancients had, yet thou haſt as ſure a word of promiſe to depend upon. For it is the ſame God which ſpeaketh in a general promiſe to thee, that did in a particular to them. Hence we find the Apoſtle comforting and encouraging the godly by ſuch a promiſe, as
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:48709:188"/>
was peculiarly made to <hi>Joſhua</hi> in that extraordinary Office he was called unto, <hi>Heb. 13. 5. For he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> from this ſee what he inferreth, <hi>So that we may boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper:</hi> which proveth, that even particular promiſes made to any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, do in the general reaſon of them belong to every believer. Even as we ſay of the <hi>Judicial Law,</hi> though the particular duty or puniſhment may not oblige us Chriſtians, yet the moral equity and reaſon, upon which it was grounded, doth. So though the very particular thing promiſed belong not to thee, yet that protection, ſupport and preſervation, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to thee in thy way, that thou mayeſt relie upon God for. Know then, that it is but the deceitfulneſs of thy heart, when thou thinkeſt, Oh if God would ſpeak from Heaven to me, or if an Angel ſhould come from God, and bid me, Be of good comfort, this or that ſhall be done for thee, then I could reſt ſatisfied. For if thou doeſt not believe God ſpeaking in a general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, neither wouldſt thou in a particular one. <hi>Mary Magdolen,</hi> and ſome others had a peculiar particular teſtimony from Chriſt, <hi>That her ſinnes were forgiven her,</hi> yet every humbled and repenting ſinner may apply the promiſes of pardon to his own ſoul, as fully and as boldly as ſhe did. For Chriſt doth ſtill in the world ſpeak ſo to every unfeigned convert. It is true, we grant, that in the Apoſtles dayes, when the gift of miracles was neceſſary for the Church, then ſome had a peculiar command and promiſe by faith and truſting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were able to do miracles and wonders, and this was called, <hi>The faith of miracles.</hi> And for any to conceive ſuch a thing of himſelf now, and to truſt in God for to performe ſome miracle, is to be ignorant of what ſpirit we are: yet ſtill we are called to a faith and truſt in God, which is almoſt as wonderfull, as that of <hi>Miracles.</hi> The truſting in God for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of thy ſinnes, for thy preſervation in temptations, for thy ſafe conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee to Heaven, through all the oppoſitions in the way, is as difficult as miraculous faith. So alſo the truſting upon God in temporals, when thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath been like a wilderneſs, when no viſible hopes or props have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is like a miraculous faith. Hence there are learned Divines <hi>(Synopſis puri. Theol.)</hi> that do grant, there is ſtill in the godly a faith, though not miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, yet anſwering that, which they call <hi>Fides ſpecialis,</hi> whereby the Spirit of God doth in a peculiar manner raiſe up the ſoul to truſt in God. For this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular God ſometimes, when he provideth a mercy for his people, doth prepare their hearts to expect it. Onely we muſt take heed that we do not baptize our deluſions, and the ſtrong conjectures of our humane perſwaſions with the name of this <hi>ſpecial faith.</hi> The ſumme of this head is to informe the people of God, that the general promiſes are as ſure an anchor to faſten thy ſoul in the midſt of waves, as particular are.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is good to conſider, <hi>What are the immediate oppoſites and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. What are the oppoſites, to truſting in God. 1. Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                  <hi>to this grace of truſting in God, that ſo we may avoid thoſe rocks from ſplitting our ſouls thereat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt enemy to it is <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and that is, <hi>When men do not truſt in God, in his way.</hi> We repreſent God to our ſelves in our own carnal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and then we truſt in him, which is indeed nothing elſe, but to truſt in our vaine lying hearts. Now this preſumption, which hath the appearance of truſting in God, but is not ſo, may be diſcovered theſe <note place="margin">Signs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. 1. When we walk not by Scripture-light.</note> wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When we do not judge of God according to the Scripture-diſcovery made of him, when we walke not by Scripture-light.</hi> There can be no truſting in God without a true knowledge of him out of his Word. Now if you obſerve ignorance herein is the cauſe of all that preſumption which drowneth many ſouls in perdition. Take the moſt prophane and profligate wretch, who like
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:48709:188"/>
                  <hi>Cain</hi> almoſt have the marks of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them, palpably ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting themſelves, yet they will tell you, they truſt in God for mercy, they reſt on Chriſt to be ſaved: Is not all this, becauſe they do not know God out of his Word? If they did, would not they find there, that he is angry with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked every day, <hi>That he is a conſuming fire; That if a man regard iniquity in his heart, God will not hear ſuch a mans prayer?</hi> Are not theſe ſo many thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolts to ſtrike thee out of thy preſumption?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not truſting in God, but <hi>preſumption, When we are confident and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. When we are confident without a promiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>bold, where we have no promiſe from God.</hi> For this you heard, That Gods promiſe and our truſt, doth neceſſarily reſpect each other: So that if you take away the promiſe, you remove the foundation, and ſo faith muſt fall to the ground. And this doth plainly alſo diſcover, that that which ſome call their truſting, and their dependance upon God, is nothing but their arrogance and their falſe preſumption. Such are the confidences that men have for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their heretical and damnable opinions. No doubt but ſuch may finde in themſelves a reſolved and pertinacious frame of heart, which they call a <hi>trusting in God;</hi> but becauſe they have no promiſe made to their errours, therefore they have no true faith in God. I ſpeak of ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are not conſiſtent with the work of grace, and fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion: otherwiſe if gold and precious ſtones be built on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, though hay and ſtubble be the ſuperſtructure, ſuch ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Preſumption</hi> is palpably diſcovered from truſting in God, <hi>By ſevering the meanes from the end.</hi> And this is commonly made the very eſſence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, <note place="margin">3. When we ſeparate the means from the end.</note> that it divideth thoſe things, which God hath neceſſarily conjoyned together. It is the Scriptures maxim, which can never fall to the ground, <hi>That without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> Where there is no grace here, there ſhall not be any glory hereafter: yet do not men generally preſume, as if that Text would not prove true; otherwiſe, why is it, that thou doeſt not lay all thoughts and endeavours about other things aſide, and ſee to the work of grace above all things? I may be wealthy and damned, I may be learned and damned, but I cannot be gracious and damned: yet who is there that maketh this his ſtudy and inquiſition of ſoul, whether this neceſſary work of grace hath ever yet been wrought in him? But</p>
               <p n="4">4. This <hi>preſumption</hi> is ſtill the more palpable and groſs, <hi>When men do not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. When we uſe falſe means</note> 
                  <hi>onely divide between the true meanes and the end, but uſe falſe and contrary means.</hi> And this is the condition of all thoſe who live in the common practice of any groſs ſinne, never reforming of it. For theſe men to truſt in Chriſt, to be ſaved, living and dying after that manner, is the moſt abſurd and maddeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that can be: As if thou ſhouldeſt think by brimſtone, to quench the fire upon thy houſe. God indeed doth ſometimes work his glorious ends by thoſe means which are contrary; but for thee to think to go to Heaven by the way that leadeth to hell, argueth thou art bewitched with thy luſts. Repent, for thou art as yet in the gall of bitterneſs, and bonds of iniquity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>This preſumption doth powerfully, but ſubtilly work in all thoſe, who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. When we think by our own ſtrength to obtain grace and glory.</note> 
                  <hi>deny either in whole, or in part the grace of God, and thinke by their owne ſtrength and merits to obtain the good things they hope for.</hi> Therefore <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> do by the very <hi>genius</hi> of their Doctrine, teach men to preſume, when they define their <hi>Spes</hi> to be, <hi>Partim è gratiâ Dei, partim è meritis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniens.</hi> So that pure faith, and truſting in God, is not taught by Popiſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but preſumption and ſelf-confidence is taught by a Law. And under this head, all thoſe civil and moral men are comprehended, who think that for their own righteouſneſs, God muſt beſtow ſuch and ſuch mercies upon them: a ſinne that every man is very prone unto, as appeareth by <hi>Moſes</hi> his prohibition of it
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48709:189"/>
ſo often in one Chapter to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Deut. 9. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Speak not in thy heart, ſaying, for my righteouſneſſe the Lord hath brought me to poſſeſſe this Land.</hi> The <hi>Phariſee</hi> then doth preſume as well as the <hi>Publican,</hi> though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on different grounds.</p>
               <p>The ſecond oppoſite on the contrary is, <hi>Despair.</hi> Indeed all diffidence and <note place="margin">2. Deſpair.</note> diſtruſt doth gradually and in part oppoſe this excellent grace; but deſpair doth fully and totally. And this ariſeth from theſe cauſes:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Low thoughts of God and his Attributes. <note place="margin">Whence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair ariſes. 1. From low thoughts of God. As 1. The power of God.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. High thoughts of our own ſins and unworthineſs. Both theſe commonly go to make the ſoul wholly diſtruſtfull.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Low thoughts of God, and his Attributes.</hi> As if God had not power and ſtrength enough to do what he promiſed. As that Lord, who would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God could ſuddenly provide ſuch incredible plenty. And this is the reaſon why God doth repreſent his Greatneſs, Majeſty and Power ſo often, becauſe all the diſtruſtfull thoughts we have, do ariſe, becauſe we meaſure God after the capacity of a man. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 6. when God had promiſed the reſtauration of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> an impoſſible thing to humane conjectures, <hi>If it be marvellous in the eyes of the people, ſhould it alſo be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in my eyes. ſaith God?</hi> As alſo that full affirmation, <hi>That with God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is impoſſible;</hi> yea nothing is hard and difficult to God; he doth as eaſily work extraordinary and miraculous things, as he doth ordinary and common things: But why do we diffide or deſpair at any time, but becauſe we judg of God according as we would do of men?</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Low thoughts about the goodneſſe, mercy and compaſſions of God, do</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</note> 
                  <hi>compell to despair. My thoughts as are not your thoughts; but as the Heavens do exceed the earth, ſo doth my wayes your wayes,</hi> ſaith God in this particular about pardon of ſinne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 8, 9. Narrow apprehenſions alſo about the dignity, merit, and infinite worth of Chriſt, of his Godhead as well as manhood, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us to ſink under the guilt of our ſinnes. How could any tormenting feares <note place="margin">3. Of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt.</note> ariſe in thee, if the love of Chriſt, and the atonement by his bloud be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the breadth, length and depth of it. It was attentive meditation on this infinite ſubject, that made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo triumph, and be raiſed above the guilt of his ſins, his <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſins, were eaſily drowned in this ſea of blood.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe of our deſpair and total diſtruſt in God, is a <hi>prepoſterous</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. From wrong apprehenſions about our ſins.</note> 
                  <hi>and irregular apprehenſion about our ſinnes.</hi> That no ſoul can obtain pardon without repentance, without a deep and ſerious humiliation, is without doubt the Scripture-Doctrine; but then every contrite ſoul is to know, that there is a ſpiritual skill and heavenly art required in this ſorrow for it. If we ſo look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinne, as to think it our duty to flie from Chriſt, to runne from the promiſe, that no conſolation doth belong to us: This is not repentance for ſinne, but run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from one ſinne to another: As if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtung with a Serpent would obſtinately refuſe to look upon the brazen Serpent. For the Goſpel that vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth other light, that informeth us, as ſoon as ever we have unfeigned ſorrow for ſinne, and are brought low in our own eyes, not to ſtay in that wilderneſs, not to think that we can make any ſatisfaction by tears or ſorrow, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to lay hold on Chriſt, and to imbrace thoſe offers of grace, which are tendered to all that are poor and contrite in heart. Hence it is that the Spirit of Adoption, and an Evangelical frame of heart, are wonderfully conducing to truſt in God; as legal terrors, and tormenting fears of conſcience do greatly ſhake the foundations of all hope in God. <note place="margin">3. This grace of truſting in God cannot be expected to be perfect here.</note>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>You are alwayes to remember, that although we are to preſſe after perfection in this grace, as well as any other, yet none can attain to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſetled, and fixed frame of heart in truſting in God, that in no temptation, or at no time, he ſhould ever be moved and caſt down with diffidence.</hi> Who
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48709:189"/>
can expreſs greater truſt in God than <hi>David</hi> doth at ſometimes? yea would think this <hi>mountain</hi> can never be moved, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 7. which indeed is ſpoken of every godly man, <hi>He will not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 56. 3. <hi>at what time, I was afraid; I will truſt in thee.</hi> Yea in many Pſalms did he ſo farre proclaim his confidence in God, that by the event it ſeemeth, that this did regenerate into ſelf-truſting, for which God did for ſake him ſometimes, and leave him in darkneſs. But as confident as he is in God ſometimes, you have him at other times as much dejected, and without comfort or ſupport. Though therefore thou prayeſt and mourneſt after this bleſſed grace, which if perfectly enjoyed, would put thee into Heaven, while on earth, yet look to be often in conflicts, ſometimes truſting, and ſometimes diſtruſting, till God ſhould make thee perfect in Heaven, where there is no more ground for fear, ſorrow, or any diffidence.</p>
               <p>Let the Uſe be to humble the children of God under all thoſe diſtruſtfull and deſpondent thoughts they labour with. What are become of Gods mercies of old? Where are thy former experiences? Let ſuch as never knew the name of God, that have no intereſt in Chriſt, or his promiſes; let ſuch (I ſay) like <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> go up and down with perpetual tremblings and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart: but thou diſhonoureſt God, and the promiſe, and that holy calling by which thou art called, while thou art tormenting thy ſelf with cares about future things. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 36. It is made the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſinne, an <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> ſinne. How then cometh it about that Chriſtianity hath taught thee no better? Who may walk confidently, and with quiet ſpirits, though the Earth be removed into the Sea, if thou mayeſt not? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> giving Characters of confident men, <hi>(Rhetor. lib.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">do</hi>.) among others hath theſe two parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, 1. Such are <hi>confident, who have great power and might, or have friends that are ſo: Now is there any greater than God? Is there any mightier than he?</hi> 2. Thoſe are <hi>confident</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that are well-affected to religious and divine things.</hi> And is it not thus with thee? Art not thou carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the commands of God? Art not thou tender about his worſhip, and his glory? Indeed ſinne and contempt of holy things, that muſt needs emaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate and take away all courage; but thy faithfulneſs to God, may make thee aſſured of his faithfulneſs to thee.</p>

               <p>THe Apoſtle having commemorated the goodneſs and power of God in his deliverances, attributing all to his mercy; he doth in this verſe declare what helps and means were likewiſe to be uſed for the accompliſhing thereof. For he that truſteth in God alone for any deliverance, doth alſo diligently uſe thoſe appointed means, which God hath commanded. Neither doth the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and power of God to do any thing for us, diſoblige us from a carefull at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to thoſe wayes, wherein the mercy is to be obtained.</p>
               <p>In that therefore <hi>Paul</hi> having expreſſed his aſſurance of preſent and future deliverance, doth alſo excite and exhort them to pray for him, we have</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A Demonſtration of the nature of that confidence which was in him; it was <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>genuine,</hi> not <hi>preſumption,</hi> which ſeparateth end and means from another.</item>
                  <item>2. Here was an Evidence of his <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>modeſty.</hi> For though a Saint in the higheſt forme, farre excelling others is gifts and graces, yet he earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth the prayers of thoſe that are inferiour to him.</item>

               <p>The Text therefore is a further amplification of his deliverance:</p>

                  <item>1. From the <hi>Means</hi> uſed to obtain it. <hi>Piſcator</hi> calleth this prayer, <hi>Cauſam adjuvantem,</hi> but that expreſſion is too big. The Churches prayer is a means, not a cauſe prevailing in the behalf of others.</item>
                  <item>2. From the <hi>End,</hi> which is, <hi>Thanksgiving by others,</hi> as in time is to be ſhewed.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Let us conſider the <hi>Means</hi> ſpecified in the Text; and therein we have the <hi>Means</hi> it ſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is emphatical, <hi>You alſo,</hi> implying, that neither Gods promiſe, or his power, would procure this mercy alone without their prayer. Beſides the goodneſs of God on his part, there muſt be prayer on their part. The word in the original for <hi>helping</hi> is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical, being twice compounded. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, This word doth denote the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Miniſtry of thoſe who are under us;</hi> and ſo it doth imply, that the Church doth owe as a debt unto their ſpiritual guides earneſt prayer for them. Though the Miniſters be their ſervants in ſome reſpects, in reſpect of the end of their office, as all Governours are; yet they are their ſervants in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, by way of obedience to their word, and conſtant prayer for them. But then there is the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> added, which doth denote not onely their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual prayers, but their concord and agreement therein, and that in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:48709:190"/>
and ſolemn Aſſemblies. Again, the word ſignifying to <hi>work</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> doth denote what the nature of prayer is, that the ſoul labours therein, is fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, full of agonies: which ſheweth, that the cuſtomary formal prayers of moſt people are not worthy of the name; there is no labour or fervency of the ſoul therein.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, You have the <hi>way, how they laboured by prayer.</hi> The meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to be ſpoken to afterwards. They did not labour by uſing friends to ſollicite the Magiſtrate in <hi>Paul</hi>'s behalf, for there was no hope from them, but they made their addreſſes to God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Here is the <hi>Subject</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>You helping together.</hi> It is an honour <hi>Paul</hi> puts upon them by this expreſſion, and thereby alſo commendeth their duty to them, of praying for them.</p>
               <p>Several Obſervations are contained in this particular. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whereas we ſee <hi>Paul reſting alone</hi> upon the goodneſſe and power of God for his deliverance, yet not excluding, but rather deſiring the prayers of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as a neceſſary means to have this alſo obtained. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a Chriſtians duty not to ſeparate from, or oppoſe the grace and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">'Tis our duty not to ſeparate Gods power and goodneſſe from the means requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> 
                  <hi>power of God to the duties and means he alſo hath required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to ſay, becauſe it's Gods grace, and Gods work, therefore I will ſit down and do nothing. Now on the other ſide, God commands me to pray, to work, therefore it is not the grace of God, but my duties that do juſtifie and ſave me. You may read how happily the Apoſtle conjoyneth them together, <hi>Phil. 2. 12, 13. Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do.</hi> It is true, the enemies of Gods grace, who detract from it in whole or in part, do gladly imbrace this truth, and compel it to go two miles further than it would; They force it ſo much, that blood cometh out in ſtead of milk. As <hi>Auſtin,</hi> while he writeth againſt <hi>Manichees, Pelagians</hi> did take ſome expreſſions of his commending them exceedingly (as that <hi>all ſinne muſt be voluntary, elſe it could not be a ſinne,</hi> &amp;c.) as if he had been on their party. Then on the other ſide, when he did valiantly write againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> they branded him for a <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chee.</hi> So hard a matter is it to defend truth which lieth between two extreams; but while we ſet againſt one, we are thought to draw nigh to another. And thus it is in the Doctrine now obſerved, while we maintain the neceſſity of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as Gods grace, we are thought to go into the Papiſts quarters. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, while againſt them, we ſet up the grace and power of God, excluding, though not the duties and means God hath appointed, yet the merit and cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them, we are thought to joyn with the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> whereas indeed we have no affinity with either.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore labour after that ſpiritual skill and diſcerning whereby we <note place="margin">How God and the creature work together 1. All Gods ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be accompliſhed.</note> may be able to know what God doth, and what we are to do, yet ſo as not to take off in the leaſt manner from the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Therefore conſider, <hi>That all the great ſpiritual mercies which God doth vouchſafe in time to his people, have many things concurrent before they be accompliſhed.</hi> It is not the preſence of one thing alone can effect that mercy, unleſs all be preſent: I ſay it is thus with theſe ſpiritual priviledges God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth in time. For as for <hi>predeſtination,</hi> which is an immanent act, and the purpoſe of God from eternity to prepare for glory. There is nothing at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current to that, but the meer good pleaſure of his will. The Scripture alwayes reſolveth it into that alone, but it is otherwayes with <hi>justification</hi> and <hi>glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For to <hi>juſtification</hi> many things are required, there is the <hi>grace of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:48709:191"/>
as the <hi>efficient cauſe,</hi> the <hi>blood of Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>meritorious cauſe,</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> as the <hi>inſtrument,</hi> the hyſop to ſprinkle this blood upon the ſoul. Now till all theſe meet together, a man is not juſtified. God indeed hath decreed to juſtifie thee from all eternity; but the actual juſtification of thy perſon is in this order and method. So for glorification, the kingdom of glory is ſaid to be prepared for the godly, <hi>viz.</hi> from eternity, they were before the foundations of the world were laid, elected to this everlaſting happineſs; but an holy life, and a godly converſation is the way thereunto. No unclean thing can enter there. This being ſo,</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>It hath alwayes bred much confuſion and errour</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of theſe requiſites one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath bred much confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and errour.</note> 
                  <hi>in Doctrine, to oppoſe theſe requiſites one againſt another.</hi> To argue from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of ſome to the excluſion of others; if duty, then no Chriſt; if Chriſt, then no duty. The <hi>Antinomian</hi> he argueth, If Chriſt by his blood made atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our ſinnes, if our iniquities were laid upon him, then we are juſtified from that time in the ſight of God, before we do believe or repent. Now whence ariſeth this errour? Becauſe they conſider not that as Chriſt is required in a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious way, ſo alſo faith in an inſtrumental way: And though Chriſt do more principally concurre to our juſtification, yet faith is required by neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and means alſo. Chriſt without faith doth not juſtifie, no more than faith without Chriſt. Hence they are put together, <hi>Rom. 3. 25. Whom God hath ſit out to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> The <hi>Papiſt</hi> on the other ſide, though the Scripture mentioneth not the word merit and ſatisfaction, yet by their forced conſequences they would eſtabliſh ſuch a Doctrine. Now in the ſenſe they and others plead for works, notwithſtanding all their ſubtil diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The Apoſtle argueth infallibly, <hi>Rom. 11. If of grace, then not of works; and if of works, then grace is no longer grace.</hi> Though therefore ſome do more groſly then others ſet up works againſt Chriſt, yet they become guilty of diſhonouring him, who give him not the ſole glory of our redemption.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>If Gods grace and our duty muſt go together, if we muſt look to Chriſt for ſalvation, and yet to holineſs, to prayer and repentance, as the means conducing thereunto: How may we be directed ſo to live, as that we ſhall give all to the glory of Gods grace, and his power, and yet to act in the duties God hath commanded, without any negligence therein? For ſeeing that Satan is very buſie in his temptations on both ſides, either to be careleſs of prayer, and other ordinances, becauſe we are to give all to Chriſt; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are neceſſarily required, to put our truſt and confidence in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them, it is good to be informed wherein the way is clear for a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers avoiding all dangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To anſwer this, which will indeed explicate the whole nature of the Doctrine, <note place="margin">How we ſhould relie wholly upon Chriſt, and yet make uſe of the means, and how we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do or no. 1. When we acknowledge whatſoever we have to come from Chriſt.</note> conſider theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Then thou mayeſt relie on Chriſt, and yet be diligent in the uſe of all Ordinances, when thou doeſt acknowledge all the power thou haſt, both in whole or in part, to the very beginning of godlineſs, to come alone from him.</hi> When whatſoever thou art able to do thou doeſt confeſs, it is his gift, thou haſt received it from him; ſo that it is not thou that doeſt it, not thy power, thy ſtrength, but the gift of God alone. Thus <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12, 13. when he had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that excellent frame of heart, <hi>That he knew how to abound and how to want;</hi> yea, <hi>that he could do all things;</hi> he mollifieth this preſently, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Chriſt, He could do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthned him.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> doth put forth the life of grace, but the fountain of it is Chriſt. So again, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. I laboured more abundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God, which was with me,</hi> or <hi>in me,</hi> exciting of me, and giving me ſtrength to do it. The trumpet of grace is often in theſe acknowledgements, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 5. We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing, as of our
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48709:191"/>
ſelves.</hi> He doth not ſay to <hi>do,</hi> but not ſo much as to <hi>think.</hi> And he doth not ſay, <hi>great things,</hi> or <hi>high things,</hi> but <hi>any thing:</hi> Not the leaſt good thing in his miniſterial way, <hi>but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> Therefore to curb the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſuch proud thoughts, as if we cou'd do any thing of our ſelves, ſee with what authority he ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Who maketh thee to differ from another? And what haſt thou, that thou diaſt not receive?</hi> Therefore the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> and <hi>Semi-pelagians</hi> of old, theſe did ſo ſet up duty, and their own power therein, that they did take off from Chriſt and his grace. The former, they held not grace neceſſary, unleſs it were for the more eaſie working, <hi>ad facilius operandum;</hi> but if this were ſo, then Chriſt was in vain in reſpect of any abſolute neceſſity. The latter, they held our endeavours, our deſires and groans did go before, and then grace was beſtowed upon us to put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to effectual operations: But all this is derogatory to the grace and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, who of ſpiritually dead, makes us to live a ſupernatural life, being made new creatures, and ſo act from that principle of life infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We do exerciſe our ſelves in prayer and other Ordinances without</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. When we attribute no merit or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality to the means.</note> 
                  <hi>any diſhonour to the grace and power of Chriſt, when we attribute no merit, or cauſality to them.</hi> And this is a ſtep higher than the former. For in Popery, beſides Chriſt they preſs the neceſſity of holy works, as merits; but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the grace of God, to be the foundation thereof. They ſay, our faith, our love, our repentance muſt be the fruits of the Spirit, and the effects of Gods grace; but then they deſtructively adde, That theſe do merit eternal life, and by ſuch duties we make compenſation to the juſtice of God. Now you muſt know, that they plead not for merit in a rude and groſſe manner, as if the works flowing from us did deſerve a crown of glory, but as we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to them by grace, and thereupon they ſay, to call the graces we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled unto by Chriſt menſtruous cloaths, or dung and droſſe, they think to be a manifeſt injury to God himſelf. But certainly when <hi>Paul would not be found in the righteouſneſſe he had;</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were not juſtified by the works they did, though regenerated perſons; This doth fully overthrow all merit, under any diſtinction whatſoever. Look then thou diſtinguiſh between the neceſſity of the duty, and the merit thereof. See thy ſelf bound to the uſe of all Ordinances, but attribute no condignity to them to make thee worthy of Gods favour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then we derogate not from Chriſt, when in the conſtant exerciſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. When we reſt upon Chriſt onely for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> 
                  <hi>of theſe, we reſt onely upon him for our juſtification.</hi> Though we pray for our ſelves and others, though we diligently attend to the whole courſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, yet in regard of reconciliation with God, and acceptance of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we go out of all to Chriſt alone; <hi>It hath pleaſed the Father, that in Chriſt all fullneſſe ſhould dwell,</hi> Col. 1. 14. Fullneſs is not to dwell in thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or graces, but in Chriſt. Hence alſo <hi>Epheſ. 1. 6. We are accepted of in the beloved.</hi> It is not then in our own performances, nor in any thing that we can do, that we are to look for acceptance. <hi>David,</hi> though living under the Old Teſtament diſpenſations, yet ſaw ſo much of Goſpel-light and Goſpel-grace, <hi>That if God entered into judgement with his ſervant, no fleſh could be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his ſight,</hi> Pſalm 143. 2. Doe not then confound ſanctification and juſtification together, which is the continual errour in Popery. Be diligent in active righteouſneſs, but reſt in paſſive, <hi>viz.</hi> that righteouſneſs of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the believer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>We performe duties and Ordinances without derogation to Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. When we put no truſt or confidence in the means.</note> 
                  <hi>when we put no truſt or ſecret confidence in them, but look upon them onely as the ſignes and evidences of Chriſts dwelling in us.</hi> We may indeed be much comforted, and rejoyce in the diſcovering of graces in our hearts: but to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48709:192"/>
put any confidence in them, to reſt upon them, as if in them we might ſtand before God: This is to miſtake, and to give to our graces what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Chriſt; and that Chriſtian muſt have a diſcerning ſpirit, even an Eagles eye, that can difference between comfort from duties, and reſting in duties. Then alſo we put no truſt in them, when we are by them lifted up to draw nigh to Chriſt; when they are to us, what the tree was to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> to raiſe us up higher, that we may have communion with Chriſt. If then we look upon our graces, as the reſtimonies of Gods love, and exerciſe our ſelves in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as thoſe whereby we draw nigh to Chriſt himſelf, then Chriſt is glorified, not diſhonoured by them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Then we uſe ſpiritual duties oppoſitely to the honour of God, when we thinke to profit him, or advantage him thereby.</hi> When we have done all, <note place="margin">5. We diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in the uſe of the means, when we think we profit him thereby.</note> we are <hi>to judge our ſelves unprofitable ſervants,</hi> as to God: God needeth not any of our ſervice; He hath millions of Angels, and thouſands of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, which offer him praiſe and honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſpot and defilement: So that it is his gracious condeſcenſion to accept of our duties: It is his mercy, that he will regard our prayers; They are liker to noiſome vapours, than to frankincenſe, and yet God is pleaſed to receive them as ſuch. If therefore thou art after all duties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly debaſed and humbled, ſaying, Who am I Lord? And what am I, that I ſhould be received into thy preſence? and ſo going from duties, not as giving to God, but receiving from him, not as if thou hadſt honoured him, but he had honoured thee, then Chriſt and duties are well accorded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction.</hi> What ſubtil and ſecret refined wayes of ſinning the heart of man is guilty of? For whereas all will conclude, that not to pray, not to be diligent in duties, is to oppoſe Chriſt, and withſtand him; there is a more myſtical and undiſcerned way of oppoſing Chriſt and God, which is by religious duties and Ordinances, when we make them more than means, when we give merit to them, and put any confidence in them. How heavy an aggravation is this, while we pray to God to provoke God, while we call on Chriſt, to diſhonour Chriſt? Search out therefore for thy ſins, not onely in the open wayes of impiety, but in the paths of holineſs. In thy prayers, in the ordinances, look to find out ſinnes there, as well as temptations of more diſſoluteneſs. The works of the Law kept men off from Chriſt, as well as the works of the fleſh.</p>

                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 11.</bibl>
                  <q>You alſo helping together by Prayer for us.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THis Text you heard, is declarative of the meanes which were to be uſed by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the mercy <hi>Paul</hi> truſted in God for, might be accompliſhed. The meanes, that is <hi>Prayer,</hi> but a <hi>labouring Prayer,</hi> and with accord and agreement; yea, ſuch an <hi>helping in Prayer,</hi> as is a debt of ſervice, and miniſtration to their ſpirituall guides. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when taken ſtrictly, and diſtinctly to other words that are alſo rendred <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>ſupplications;</hi> (as ſome would expound that place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.) doth ſignifie <hi>prayer</hi> only in this limited ſenſe, as it is a deprecation againſt ſome evill, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a petition for ſome good; and in this ſenſe it may very well be uſed here. But becauſe we ſee the Scripture commonly uſing it in a more large ſenſe, neither will we reſtraine it in this place. From the former part then of this <hi>Verſe,</hi> there remaine further Doctrines obſervable. As</p>
               <p>Firſt. <hi>Thoſe that are the moſt eminent in gifts and office, yea and grace</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in gifts and graces, need the prayers of their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</note> 
                  <hi>alſo, do need the Prayers of thoſe, who are farre inferior in the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No eye in this ſpirituall body is ſo perfect, that it may ſay to the foot, <hi>I have no need of thee.</hi> When the Apoſtle doth thus deſire the Prayers of the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> he doth it not in a complement, neither doth he ſpeak it for modeſty and humility ſake, but cordially and really, as finding the want of them. Chriſt indeed being God and Man, though as Man he prayed to God, yet he needed no mans prayer for him; neither did he ever require his Diſciples to pray for him, no, not when he was in the greateſt agonies. He blamed them indeed for their dullneſs, and that they could not watch with him one hour; but he did not require their prayers for him. But there is no godly man, though a <hi>Paul,</hi> though never ſo eminent, but as he is to pray for others; ſo alſo he needeth that others ſhould pray for him. Hence you have this eminent Saint often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the prayers of others, his intereſt in God alone will not do it. Though he be a favourite in the Court of Heaven, yet others alſo muſt intercede for him. <hi>Job, Daniel,</hi> and others, though they be inſtanced in, as ſuch who can greatly prevaile with God in prayers for others, as if the eare of God were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to them, more than to others; yet they themſelves did want the prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48709:193"/>
for them. And thus we have <hi>Paul</hi> again and again deſiring the prayers of others for him, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 17. when he had delivered many ſhort and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Aphoriſmes, more neceſſary to the ſoules health, then thoſe of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> for the body; and having alſo prayed for them, he requireth the ſame duty for himſelf, <hi>Brethren pray for us.</hi> That as the Clouds drop upon the earth to refreſh that, and that ſends up vapours again, which are congealed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Clouds; thus it ſhould be with Paſtors and People, a mutuall and a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call praying for each other, will greatly advantage and promote their ſpirituall good. Thus the ſame Apoſtle, to the ſame people, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 1. ſaith in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding way, <hi>Finally, Brethren pray for us.</hi> In the like manner, alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. he deſireth they would <hi>pray for him,</hi> giving his reaſon, <hi>becauſe of the good conſcience he had in his work;</hi> So that where there is godlineſs and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we ought to be ſo farre from neglecting prayer for them, thinking they do not need it, that we are the rather to be incouraged in that ſervice for them. And if you ſay theſe inſtances are of whole Churches, <hi>Paul</hi> may well deſire the prayers of Churches Aſſembled together; but doth he need the prayer of a particular perſon? Yes; this you will alſo find, <hi>Phil. 2. 2. I truſt, through your prayers, I ſhall be given to you.</hi> Thus you ſee the moſt eminent deſiring the prayers of thoſe that are inferiour to them; and there are good grounds for this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe there is a more particular promiſe made of Gods preſence and power to many gathered together, than to one;</hi> to the prayers of more then <note place="margin">Reaſons. 1. Becauſe there is a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar promiſe made to the prayers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny then one.</note> one, as more coales together do the more eaſily inflame. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>of two, that they are better than one,</hi> is true alſo in reſpect of prayer. You have this notably affirmed by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth. 18. 19, 20 If two of you ſhall agree on earth as touching any thing that they ſhall aske, it ſhall be done for them.</hi> This is ſo remarkeable, that our Saviour uſeth that expreſſion, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain I ſay to you,</hi> and then giveth the reaſon, <hi>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in the midſt of them.</hi> By this it is plain, that <hi>vis unita eſt fortior, the united force of believers, is ſtronger then ſingle and alone.</hi> Hence our Saviour in his Forme of Prayer directeth to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> not, <hi>my Father,</hi> becauſe of the Communion the godly have in this duty. Seeing then there is a more peculiar preſence of God in the midſt of his people Aſſembled together, then when alone; no wonder if <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their prayers. Thus it was in <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, the whole Church met together to pray for his deliverance; which prayer was ſo prevalent, that it broke open the Priſon doores, and made every thing yield to it. It is mentioned as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall priviledge by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> to be vouchſafed to <hi>Solomon,</hi> Pſal. 72. 15. <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alſo ſhall be made for him.</hi> It is of great conſequence to be remembred in the Aſſembly of the Saints; as on the other ſide, when the Church following Scripture-Rules have caſt ſome perſecuting <hi>Emperours</hi> out of their Prayers: this hath been the greateſt evill that could befall them, a forerunner, that God alſo would caſt them out of his favour. One occaſion which made <hi>Licinius</hi> to oppoſe <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> was becauſe the Chriſtians in their meeting prayed for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> but not for him; though happily he regarded more the diſhonour he thought put upon him, than any eſteem he had of their Prayers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Reaſon is, <hi>From the ſimilitude, which the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Becauſe the Church in Scripture is called a body, whoſe parts ſtand in need one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                  <hi>much in, when it ſpeaketh of the Church of God,</hi> that it is a <hi>body,</hi> and every particular Chriſtian is a <hi>Member</hi> thereof; now in any <hi>naturall body,</hi> though the noble and eminent parts thereof be never ſo ſound and able for their particular operations, yet there is not the moſt ignoble part in the body, but they want the help thereof, and therefore nouriſhment is carefully diſtributed to every part, as having its reſpective neceſſity. Thus it is alſo in the <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all body, the Church of God;</hi> only Chriſt the head, needeth not the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48709:193"/>
but they him. As for the reſt there is a mutuall help of every part, ſo that unleſs <hi>Paul</hi> were not of the body, unleſs he were not of this ſpirituall union, he muſt need the prayers of others. The Communion then that the body hath in this life, is the ground of praying for one another; and that is the reaſon, why, though we pray for others though alive; yet not when they are dead. It is abſurd to pray for ſuch who are deceaſed, becauſe they are now no longer in this Church-communion. The eye doth not now need the feet, all want is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and that viſible union of believers in Church-adminiſtrations, is now quite diſſolved. What elſe may be added in this particular, ſhall be ſuggeſted in the next.</p>
               <p>Only the Uſe of this is to admoniſh the moſt excellent and choiſeſt Chriſtian <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> 
                  <hi>of humility and modeſty;</hi> though thy gifts and graces, though thy office and place be farre above other private Chriſtians, yet remember thou wanteſt their prayers. They that cannot help thee by counſell and advice; they that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help thee by direction, yet may by prayer. Therefore do nothing that may abate their zeale and love in prayer for thee. It may alſo teach thee humility in this reſpect. When thou findeſt great inlargements, good ſucceſs in thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, be not lifted up; as if God did this for any righteouſneſs it may be in thee, but becauſe of other mens prayers; attribute ſuch things to their prayers, rather then thy graces. But we proceed to the ſecond Doctrine, which is,</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That people do owe unto their spirituall guide, as a debt of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">People ought to pray for their ſpirituall guides.</note> 
                  <hi>ſervice, their earneſt prayers for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much you heard was implyed in the Greek word. Thoſe that ſow unto you ſpirituals, are not only to reap of your carnals, but alſo of your ſpirituals; you are not to communicate only with him that teacheth you, in your temporall good things but your ſpirituall alſo. Thus the Church looked upon it as a duty to make ſupplications for <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was in Priſon; and certainly the ſpirituall labourer is not only worthy of his wages, but of your heartieſt and moſt fervent prayers; and thoſe people who do neglect this duty, it is a ſigne that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get good by the Miniſtry, nor is it their deſire to do ſo. Hence ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and Preaching becometh ſo ineffectuall to thee. Thou art the ſame ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and prophane man, as thou wert many years ago. Is not this becauſe thou never rightly prayeſt to God that the miniſtry may be bleſſed to thee. But to inlarge on this, Conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is a wild and abſurd opinion of the</hi> Socinians, <hi>who hold that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth. 1. 'Tis an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Socinians to ſay, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands prayer only in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>prayer is only commanded in the New Teſtament.</hi> That Chriſt made it a new precept to pray, ſo that although the godly in the Old Teſtament did pray, yet they ſay, they had no command for it. This they make one of the new <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall</hi> precepts Chriſt brought into the Church; but this doth openly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict Scripture. Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>Call upon me in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> doth not the Old Teſtament ſay, <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found;</hi> was not the Temple of God called the <hi>houſe of prayer?</hi> doth not <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the Dedication of his Temple, ſuppoſe that its a peoples duty under judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to pray and humble themſelves under Gods hand, that ſo they may be removed from off them. It was therefore alwayes a duty both in the Old and New Teſtament to pray to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Though prayer be the meanes whereby God accompliſheth great things</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. No merit or confidence to be put in our prayers.</note> 
                  <hi>for his people, yet we muſt not put any merit or confidence in our prayers.</hi> To be proud of thy prayers, is a great abſurdity; for thy prayer to God doth teſtifie that thou art nothing, that thou canſt do nothing: for if thou canſt do things of thy ſelfe, why needeſt thou pray? That is the reaſon, the <hi>Socinians</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:48709:194"/>
give, why in the Old Teſtament, there needed no precept of prayer, becauſe there was then nothing promiſed; but they were able to fullfill the condition thereof by their own power. But the foundation of that is rotten, for they had the ſame ſpirituall things promiſed only more obſcurely, that we have; and were no wayes of themſelves to performe their conditions: otherwiſe we will grant that what a man can do of his own power independently upon God, he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not pray for it; but there is nothing wherein man doth not need the gift of God, whether for temporall, or neceſſary things: and ſeeing the way to have it is only by prayer, this exalteth God, and debaſeth man, ſo that it is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the duty in hand, when we reſt upon our prayers, as if the beggar ſhould be proud from his asking of almes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The duty of prayer is reciprocall; Miniſters are to pray for their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Miniſters are to pray for their people, and people for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> 
                  <hi>and People for their Miniſters.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> who ſo often deſireth the Churches prayers, doth as often demonſtrate his continuall and fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for them; yea, though a people be never ſo unworthy, ſo wretched and malicious, yet they will ſay with <hi>Samuell, God forbid I ſhould ceaſe to pray for you;</hi> ſo that thy prayers for thoſe who labour in the work of the Lord, are not in vain. They are recompenced with prayers again, and never are people a bleſſing and comfort to a Miniſter, nor is a Miniſter a bleſſing to them, till there be this mutuall praying; for if the prayer of one man doth prevaile much, how much then will the prayers of many righteous perſons for each other? So that we ſee why the Devill and his inſtruments are ſo buſie in ſowing of diſcords and contentions between Paſtor and People; why inſtead of praying for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there are ſlanderings, detractitions, and malicious oppoſitions of one another: for by this diſcord the Devils Kingdome is promoted, and their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for one another are hindred.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When we ſay, <hi>That its a debt which people owe, to pray for their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the people to be both gifted and gracious.</note> 
                  <hi>guides; this ſuppoſeth that the people whom he watch over, ſhould be both a gifted and a gracious people. Gifted,</hi> Such who are able to make their requeſts known to God, and that with others, as well as alone; for how can it be expected, that he who cannot pray for himſelf, will ever pray for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Would it not be very ridiculous to deſire the prayers of many, who live under our continuall teaching. Pray, Alas they never prayed in their lives. They never pray for themſelves, or for others. But gifts without grace, are like a tinckling Cymball: God will not hear the prayers of wicked men. Therefore our people ought to be <hi>gracious</hi> as well as <hi>gifted.</hi> They muſt have pure hearts, and pure hands: how uncomely are holy prayers in an unholy mouth? There muſt be no dead flye in this precious box of Oyntment. Oh then that our Congregations were awakned to be ſuch a people, that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſpirituall duties to a ſpirituall overſeer! Do you by your prayers help on the work of their miniſtry; for our Preaching alone, without your effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all praying, will not have its bleſſed effect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>There are many particulars in which your ſoules are to be emptyed in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Many things there are which people are to deſire of God for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtor. 1. That they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. 2. That their word may be ſuceesfull.</note> 
                  <hi>prayer for them, for their preſervation and ſafety.</hi> As here <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for their workes ſake; they are expoſed to the hatred and rage of man; if the ſhepheard be ſcattered, the ſheep will quickly flye: now becauſe their calling is to remove the ſinnes of people, to ſet the Kingdome of Chriſt in the place where they live; therefore none meet with more abſurd and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adverſaries then they do: for this <hi>Paul</hi> deſireth their prayers, 2 <hi>Theſ. 3. 2. That he might be delivered from unreaſonable men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. You are to pray for them in this particular alſo, that their <hi>Miniſtery may be ſucceſſefull.</hi> That the word they Preach may find roome in the hearts of the people. As it is the Miniſters duty to give himſelf to ſtudy, and to ſeeke out fit words, that may be as ſo many Nailes faſtned by the Maſter of the Aſſemblies;
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48709:194"/>
ſo it is your duty to be as diligent in prayer for a bleſſing upon it. That to your ſelves, to your families, to your neighbours, it may be a quickning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting word. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> in that forementioned place, <hi>pray for us, that the Goſpell may have a free courſe, and be glorified.</hi> Oh what auditor doth his duty in this reſpect? thou complaineſt of the dullneſs and frowardneſs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; how much good ſeed falleth upon ſtony ground? ſee if thy ſoul may not be charged with negligence herein; hadſt thou prayed more earneſtly; hadſt thou ſought the Lord more; there might have been a more plentifull har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. When the Miniſters faithfull Preaching, and the Peoples fervent Prayer go together, then Satan will fall like lightning before them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You are to Pray for their <hi>qualifications, that their gifts and graces may</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. That their gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be quickned.</note> 
                  <hi>be quickned.</hi> That they may be filled with boldneſs, and the ſpirit of power, not fearning man, or ſinfully pleaſing him. It is a very hard thing to be qualified with all abilities and graces for the miniſteriall imployment, who is ſufficient for theſe things? and the work we have to do is unpleaſing and diſtruſtfull to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men. Now how difficultly can men ſubject to weakneſſes and infirmities do ſuch angelicall work? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who profeſſed he dyed daily, and attained to ſuch a meaſure of grace, as to bid others <hi>follow him,</hi> yet ſee the reaſon, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 20, 21. why he deſireth the <hi>Epheſians to pray for him,</hi> viz. <hi>that I may open my mouth boldly,</hi> that I may ſpeak boldly as I ought to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You are to pray even for their <hi>ſalvation,</hi> for their office being ſo great, <note place="margin">4. That they may be ſaved.</note> and they ſtanding accountable for their own and the peoples ſoules, their ſalvation is the more improbable. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaketh very ſadly to this point, as if very few Miniſters would be ſaved, becauſe of their office; however we find <hi>Paul</hi> awing his heart with this, and keeping down his body, uſing all meanes to ſuppreſs the very begining of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 17. leſt when he had Preached to others, he himſelf might be a caſt-away.</hi> Theſe offices in the Church, though ſome do ambitiouſly intrude into them, looking for glory and advantage thereby; yet ſuch, who conſider the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the office, the neceſſary qualifications and due adminiſtrations thereof, do tremble under it; and like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> are affraid to take ſuch an office upon them; but men whoſe ſpirits are hardy and confident, matter not the danger thereof. As you ſee in great high Buildings, how Maſons and other Artificers can ſtand upon an high Pinacle, and their head never be giddy, nor have any feare, but thoſe who are not accuſtomed to that way, do exceedingly tremble; thus men, who are accuſtomed to high thoughts of themſelves, that have great confidence of their own abilities, they can work on theſe Battlements, and their heads never go round; whereas men of deep modeſty and humility, are afraid to climbe ſo high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Admonition,</hi> to our people generally, how greatly is this duty neglected? how many inſtead of praying for them, curſe and revile them? but no wonder at this, ſeeing many never pray for themſelves, they never pray, nor their families pray, and then how can you help us by your prayers? Let this particular move thee, that by prayer for a bleſſing upon our Miniſteriall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, thou wilt find the benefit redound upon thy own ſoul. It will be a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning miniſtry to thee, whatever it be to others, to thee it will be ſoul-ſaving. Do you pray that your corporall bread may nouriſh your body? and will you not much rather, that your ſpirituall bread may be the bread of life to you? All lyeth not in hearing, writing, and repeating, but add to theſe effectuall prayers.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Whenſoever we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived mercies from God, we are by praiſe and thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge then to him.</note>

               <p>Prayer muſt not be alone, when it hath prevailed with God like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, prayer</hi> and <hi>praiſes</hi> muſt go together, <hi>Phil. 4. 6. In every thing by prayer and ſupplication, with thanksgiving, let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> Here you ſee <hi>ſupplication</hi> and <hi>thanksgiving</hi> muſt go hand in hand. Its no leſs Gods command to praiſe him for mercies, then to pray to him; and this truth is the more to be preſſed, becauſe of our horrible negligence herein. In our diſtreſſes, in our exigences, we call and cry unto the Lord, but in our mercies and deliverances we forget him, and do not own the Author of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and benefits. This is notably repreſented in that Hiſtory <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 17, 18. Where often Lepers that were cleanſed, there was but one did returne and give glory to God by thanksgiving, and he was a <hi>Samaritan</hi> alſo. So that thoſe from whom it was expected, did neglect this duty. We ſee by this how back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:48709:195"/>
we are to praiſe God, though very forward and earneſt to pray to him in our miſeries. Thoſe nine Lepers that regarded not to praiſe God, yet they lifted up their voices and ſaid, <hi>Jeſus, Master, have mercy on us;</hi> and thus while we are in any exigences, then our hearts are very hot and lively. Then we cry and pray, <hi>Lord hear us, our trouble is great;</hi> but if the Lord do vouchſafe his mercy to us, then God may ſay, where is the man, where is the woman that was cleanſed, that was healed, that had this or that mercy and deliverance, for they have not returned to glorifie me. It is love to our ſelves; it's a ſelf-ſeeking that makes us pray, but it would argue love to God, and an honouring of him, when we returne praiſes to him. It is therefore the duties of Miniſters to preſs you upon the duty of praiſing of God, as well as of praying unto him. Many are horribly negligent in both, ſome are more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in prayer, then they are in thanksgiving. Whereas God is ſaid <hi>to inhabit the praiſes of his people,</hi> Pſalm 22. 3. as well as he is <hi>the God that heareth prayers,</hi> Pſalm 65. 2. <hi>God dwelleth in the praiſes of Iſrael,</hi> that is, in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> continually praiſing of him; or elſe it is to ſhew, that as a man dwelleth in his houſe conſtantly reſiding there; ſo God is daily adminiſtring matter of praiſes to his people; implying thereby, that there is no time, no place, no condition, wherein we ought not to bleſs and praiſe God. Thoſe many Pſalmes which <hi>David</hi> made, declare how neceſſary a duty it is, and how much the people of God are to exerciſe themſelves therein. Hence it is that <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth he will never intermit this duty; as we are to pray without ceaſing, ſo to praiſe God without ceaſing, <hi>Pſalm 145. 1, 2. I will bleſs thy name for ever and ever; I will bleſs thee every day:</hi> See what an ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <hi>David</hi> hath to this. For although the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is any man afflicted let him pray, is any man merry let him ſing Pſalmes,</hi> James 5. 13. implying thereby, that there are ſpeciall times wherein one duty is to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, more than another: yet there is no time wherein the Lord doth not give his people occaſion to give thanks to him.</p>
               <p>That your hearts may be both rightly inſtructed in the manner of this duty, and awed againſt all ſlothfullneſs therein, take notice of theſe enſuing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>To praiſe God, there is required an acknowledgement by faith, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the praiſing of God. 1. An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that God alone is the Authour of all our mercies.</note> 
                  <hi>God, and God alone, is the Author of all the mercies, both temporall and ſpirituall, that we do enjoy.</hi> Hence an Atheiſt can never be thankfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he owneth no God, the giver of mercies: And the practicall Atheiſt, who liveth as if there were no God; he like the Swine, eateth indeed upon the fruite that he findeth upon the ground, but never looketh up to the tree from whence it falleth. Now this practicall Atheiſme doth raign every where, and that cauſeth the univerſall ingratitude that is in the world: men take theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as ſo many debts belonging to them. They look upon them as the things of a naturall courſe, not as the diſpenſations of a free and voluntary Agent; even the great God who giveth them, and denyeth them at his pleaſure. <hi>David</hi> therefore in his Pſalmes, doth ſo often magnifie God by many glorious Titles, thereby profeſſing, that <hi>From God cometh every good and perfect gift.</hi> Hence alſo the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Cap. 4. 15. maketh it the duty of every one in their daily reſolutions, to buy and ſell, or to go to ſuch a place, to ſay, <hi>if the Lord will;</hi> declaring hereby, that it is from God that we are inabled to performe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny naturall or civill action. I alſo add, that it muſt be <hi>an acknowledgment of God alone,</hi> becauſe in ſpirituall mercies many corrupt Teachers have divided the kingdome between Gods gracious power and mans mans free-will. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the <hi>Arminians,</hi> theſe do either in whole or in
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48709:196"/>
part deſtroy the very foundation of thankſgiving to God, in reſpect of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mercies; eſpecially in that whereby one man differs from another. That which the Apoſtle doth ſo evidently attribute to God only, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. that they appropriate to themſelves the good uſe of free-will, or the improving of grace offered, is made mans work; and then certainly we are to glory more in our ſelves then in God. But if we are to give God thankes for every morſell of bread we eate; ſhall we not much rather for every ſpirituall mercy to the ſoul? It was <hi>Tullies</hi> obſervation, that though their Anceſtors praiſed God for their proſperity and ſucceſs, yet they never did for their vertuous actions, thinking that abſurd, as if unleſs they were not done by their own power, there was no commendation due to them; and too much of this Heatheniſh and Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call leaven doth ſtill ſoure the minds of many Learned men in the Church. Know then, ſo much as thou ſetteſt up a free-will beyond Scripture bounds, ſo farre thou takeſt off from the duty of praiſing and bleſſing of God. Beſides we ſay, God muſt be acknowledged in every mercy, <hi>temporall</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall.</hi> Thou that prayeſt God would give thee thy daily bread, wilt thou not praiſe God when he doth it? yet how ſottiſh and brutiſh are many perſons and Families, when they go to meales, and riſe from meales, and no thankes or praiſes are given to God, ſhould not the example of Chriſt move thee? when he had but ſome loaves of Barly and a little Fiſh; yet he bleſſed God, before he did eate thereof. How then cometh it about, that there ſhould be ſuch unthankfull wretches that take their food, and yet never thank God that giveth it? Thou wouldſt account that poore man a proud or unworthy perſon, to whom thou ſhouldſt give ſome food in his neceſſity, and he never ſo much as open his mouth to give one word of thankfullneſs to thee. Thou dealeſt more froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly with God. And if for temporall mercies, then much more for ſpirituall; if thy meate, thy drink, thy rayment, be Gods mercy, much more is thy regeneration, thy juſtification, which do ſo far tranſcend the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To this duty of praiſing God, is not only required <hi>Theſe generall acts</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Both the generall and particular acts of faith.</note> 
                  <hi>of faith whereby we own him for the Jehova, and the Creator of Heaven and Earth; but alſo thoſe particular Acts, whereby we do apply and appropriate him as our God in particular.</hi> For it is this particular applying Act of faith that maketh the heart full of praiſe and thanksgivihg. Therefore you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>David</hi> in his Pſalmes, not only calling God <hi>a buckler, a refuge, a ſtrong tower,</hi> but <hi>his buckler, his ſtrong tower, his God.</hi> Neither can we be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ſpirituall mercies, about pardon of ſinne, ſupport in temptations, till with <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2, we ſay, <hi>Who loved us, and gave himſelf for us;</hi> and this is one reaſon why we urge the People to take heed of diffidence, not to give way to diſtruſt and doubtfull perplexities of ſoul, becauſe while theſe are predominant, they cannot walk thankfully and give the glory, that is due, to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Love to God,</hi> Becauſe he heareth our prayers, will raiſe up the heart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly <note place="margin">3. Love to God.</note> to thankſgiving, <hi>Pſal. 116. 1. I will love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my ſupplications.</hi> That God ſhould hear the prayers of one ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and polluted as thou art; that God ſhould do thee good, who art ſo evill; this freeneſs of his love, this riches of his grace ſhould exceedingly melt thee; it ſhould be like fire that aſſimilateth every thing into its ſelf: now when this love, like ſo many coales of fire is in thy breaſt, it cannot be, but that it will open thy heart, and thy mouth wide to praiſe the Lord. This is our corruption, we love the mercy it ſelf, but not God that giveth it; we delight in the comforts that are beſtowed upon us, but do not rejoyce in God from whence they come. If therefore thou findeſt thy heart frozen and dull; thou canſt not raiſe it up to bleſs God; meditate much upon the love of God to thee, ſo vile and unworthy.</p>

                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:48709:196"/>
4. <hi>An heavenly heart</hi> is neceſſary to bleſs and praiſe God. The praiſing of God is Angels works, and the imployment of the glorified Saints to all eternity. <note place="margin">4. Heavenly mindedneſs.</note> 
                  <hi>Praiſe is comely,</hi> but it is from clean hearts and clean mouths. We need the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to inable us to thankſgiving, as well as to prayer. <hi>Pſal. 119. 7. I'le praiſe thee with uprightneſs.</hi> An hypocrite who giveth God glory by his mouth, but reproacheth him by his life, not only his prayer, but his praiſes are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Hence <hi>Pſal. 50. ult.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Who ſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth God.</hi> But leſt you ſhould extend this to every man; See what is added, <hi>And who ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his converſation aright,</hi> &amp;c. If a man praiſe God in never ſo melodious a tune, but then there is no harmony, nor order in his life, this is a reproach to God. We may <hi>benedicere linguâ,</hi> when we do <hi>maledicere vitâ.</hi> There is a real praiſing of God by exerciſed holineſs, as well as verbal by the tongue. In the Sacrifices of thankſgiving, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 10. Whoſoever did eat thereof, that had uncleanneſs upon him, he was to be cut off. By this is typified, how unpleaſing the praiſes of ſuch are, who live in their ſins; it is as uncomely, as a pearl in the Swines mouth. It is true, God doth greatly condeſcend to accept of our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for he hath millions and millions of Angels continually praiſing of him, who have not the leaſt blemiſh or ſpot upon them: but yet he is pleaſed to take this Sacrifice at our hands. In the Sacrifice of thankſgiving, <hi>Levit.</hi> 7. 13. there was leaven allowed. <hi>Junius</hi> obſerveth, That whereas God allowed <hi>leaven</hi> in no other Sacrifice (though <hi>Bonfrerius</hi> thinketh otherwiſe, and that leaven only was forbidden ſo farre as to be offered, but the common opinion is otherwiſe) why then was <hi>leaven</hi> allowed only in this Sacrifice? Hereby to teach us (ſaith <hi>Junius)</hi> that there is corruption and ſinfulneſs in our beſt actions, and that we need the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that they be accepted of. Even then in our praiſes there is matter of humiliation, there is ſome bitterneſs, yet through Chriſt we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of. But though all pollution cannot be purged out, yet he that liveth in a wilfull way of ſinning, cannot give glory to God acceptably.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He that praiſeth God, muſt do it <hi>voluntarily, readily, chearfully,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">5. Chearfulnes.</note> it is not worthy the name of praiſe. As God loveth a <hi>cheerfull giver,</hi> ſo eſpecially a <hi>thanksgiver.</hi> To praiſe God with an heavy, lumpiſh, unwilling heart, is a contradiction to the duty in thy hand; it is as if we ſhould ſay, a black Sun, or a cold fire. <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 29, 30. The Law about a Sacrifice of thankſgiving is that when they offer it, it muſt be <hi>at their own will,</hi> which argueth the readineſs and willingneſs that ought to be in us at that time; and then on the ſame day it was to be offered, they were to eat it all up, to leave none till the morrow, whereas in other Sacrifices they might. And this was to ſhew, that he who would give thanks to God, he muſt do it ſpeedily, he muſt not delay, or put off. So that by this you ſee a praiſing frame of heart requireth a moſt curious, exact tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It's that Apothecaries ointment which belonged to the Highprieſt, onely made up of choice ingredients. A ſinfull heart cannot praiſe God, and a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart cannot praiſe God, that wants wheels to its chariots, wings to flie up with. The Lark lifteth her ſelf off from the earth, ere ſhe begins to ſing. And then a ſorrowfull dejected heart, that cannot praiſe God, no more than a ſtring in the inſtrument too much wetted, can cauſe a melodious ſound,</p>
               <p>In the next place, Let us conſider the encouragements thereunto. And <note place="margin">Motives to praiſe God. 1. 'Tis an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent duty, in that we are ſo backward to it.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The excellency of this duty is apparent, in that the heart is naturally ſo frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and oppoſite to it.</hi> It may cauſe ſome wonder, why the ſoul of a man ſhould be ſlow to this work; and commonly all are more in petitions, then in thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings. Hence <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 103. though a man more exerciſed in this ſervice, than any one, called therefore <hi>the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael,</hi> and who is not contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to praiſe God, but cals upon all the creatures in Heaven and earth, yea the moſt inconſiderable ones to <hi>praiſe God;</hi> yet he finds ſome liſtleſneſs and ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf, ſee therefore how he prepareth and ſtirreth up himſelf, as the Cock doth before his crow, <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and let all within thee praiſe
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:48709:197"/>
his holy name.</hi> His heart doth need calling upon, his ſoul muſt be moved and quicknnd ere it doth his duty. Conclude then certainly this duty is moſt excellent, it is very pleaſing to God, becauſe I am ſo backward, I am never ſcarce in a prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing temper, one clog or other is upon me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>That the Scripture vouchſafeth it the name of a Sacrifice,</hi> Heb. 13. 15. <note place="margin">2. It is called a Sacrifice.</note> Where you have the duty commanded, the time when, and the manner how, <hi>Let us offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to God, and that continually.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Seven times a day will I praiſe thee,</hi> Pſ. 119. 164. It is a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> and every <hi>ſacrifice</hi> muſt have fire; there muſt be zeal and fervency; but by whom muſt we offer it? it is by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo that he is the Altar upon which the incenſe of prayers and praiſes are to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God. By him we have both power and acceptance to praiſe God; and in this ſenſe all the people of God are called Prieſts, and they have the ſacrifices of praiſe continually to offer up unto God. Hence to praiſe God, is expreſſed <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 2. by <hi>rendring the calves of our lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is a debt that is due to God.</hi> He that hath commanded thee to pray to him, hath alſo enjoyned thee to praiſe him. Yea this is all that God looketh for; Thou <note place="margin">3. 'Tis a debt due to God.</note> canſt not ſatisfie God for thy ſins committed, thou art not able to repair his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory ſhouldſt thou be damned a thouſand times over, yet it could not recompence to God according to what thou haſt diſhonoured him. Therefore ſeeing this is the only debt God obligeth unto, why ſhould we not be more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in it? If he had required ſome greater ſervice of us, and more terrible to fleſh and blood, ought we not to have done it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>One chief motive, which is to put us upon all holy obedience unto God,</hi> is, <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</hi> There are two great and principal parts of Divinity, the one is, <hi>De gratià</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. The chief motive is thankfulneſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Dei,</hi> of <hi>the grace of God;</hi> and the other, <hi>De gratitudine hominis,</hi> of <hi>mans thankfulnes.</hi> There are indeed ſeveral reaſons why we are commanded to <hi>abound in holy works,</hi> but one of them is thereby <hi>to teſtifie our thankfulnes to God,</hi> that though we cannot do anything to merit at his hands; though <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Mediator hath purchaſed all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual priviledges; ſo that we cannot do any holy duty, as a cauſe to procure them; yet to manifeſt our thankfulnes to God, we are ready with delight to do his will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>A thanksgiving heart is the moſt proper and ſutable dispoſition to the Gospel di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation; wherein grace doth in ſo many wonderfull effects demonſtrate it ſelf.</hi> Now <note place="margin">5. A thankfull heart is the moſt proper diſpoſition to Goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.</note> praiſe doth properly anſwer to free grace and love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 16. Gods predestination and his adoption, it is, <hi>That we ſhould be to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> Theſe new ſongs ſhould alwayes be in our mouths. And again, <hi>v. 12. That we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory.</hi> So that if you ſay, Why did God predeſtinate thee? It is to his praiſe. Why doth he convert? It is to his praiſe. Thus he adopts, he juſtifieth, that we might be only to his praiſe. Thus 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. we are <hi>a choſen generation, a peculiar people, that we ſhould ſhew forth his praiſes.</hi> The children then of free grace, muſt be the children of praiſes and thankſgivings unto God. Every power of the ſoul, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the body ſhould be a tongue (as it were) to glorifie God. Were we more affected with the depth, breadth and length of this grace of God, we ſhould be more abounding in this duty of bleſſing God. <hi>David</hi> cals his tongue, his glory (though ſome apply it to the ſoul) becauſe of this work.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>If we praiſe not God when mercies are obtained by prayer, it diſcovereth a rotten and inſincere heart.</hi> It argued thou never didſt pray for mercies upon right <note place="margin">6. The neglect of this duty is an argument of a rotten heart.</note> grounds to glorifie God, to be thereby more inſtrumental in our ſervice of him, but only for our own ends, and our own neceſſities. For he that prayeth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, will praiſe God cheerfully; he will more rejoyce in the favour of God, becauſe God heareth his prayers, then the benefit obtained. If then thou neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt this duty of thankſgiving, thou diſcovereſt a prophane earthly heart, that thou preferreſt the mercy deſired above the glory and honour of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be juſt with God, never to hear thy prayers more. For thankfulneſs is the only way to preſerve mercies, and to have more added.</p>

               <p>Let us take notice of the general one, <hi>Paul</hi>'s life and preſervation, it is a gift. From whence obſerve, <note place="margin">Our ordinary temporal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are the gifts of God.</note>

               <p>

It's not Gods gift onely to ſanctifie us, to juſtifie us, but to give us our health, our food, our preſervation; ſo that we live wholly upon the meer bounty of God; we are all ſo many Almeſ-men; the world is an Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. Man doth not, or cannot obtaine the leaſt mercy with his owne wiſdom and power, without the bleſſing of God. This is a neceſſary truth. For we look more upon theſe ordinary mercies, as the fruit of our own labour, than as Gods meer free gift. The Apoſtle <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. ſaith, <hi>Every good gift is from God. Every gift,</hi> whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>ſupernatural; what have we, that we have not received,</hi> is true both in nature and grace. For although in the ſenſe that <hi>Pelagians</hi> did, it was very erroneous to confound Creation and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with grace; yet in this reſpect we may ſay, That Creation and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is of the grace and favour of God, becauſe he communicated of his goodneſſe to the creature onely from his meer favour. But to ſpeake after the Scripture-language; onely thoſe ſpiritual favours and Church-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, which conduce to eternal bleſſedneſſe, are called, <hi>The grace of God.</hi> So that health, life, and other mercies, though they be <hi>The gifts of God,</hi> yet are not called, <hi>The grace of God.</hi> However they both agree in this; our temporal mercies, and ſpiritual mercies come from God the fountain of them, though ſpiritual mercies have a more ſpecial and reſtrained conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>To affect us with humility and thankfulneſſe in this point, conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That even thoſe mercies which are the effects of natural cauſes, yet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The effects of natural cauſes, are ſtill the gift of God.</note> 
                  <hi>they are the gift of God.</hi> Should he withdraw his concourſe, no creature were able to performe its uſefull operations. The fire would not warme us, our bread would not nouriſh us, our raiment would not comfort us againſt the cold. So that we are not only to bleſs God that we have ſuch creatures as theſe are, but that they are uſefull. We are not only to praiſe God that we have bread and raiment, but that theſe things can do their office. For in theſe there is a two-fold mercy,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God doth provide them for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That when they are provided, they put forth their uſefulneſſe. Thus our Saviour alledgeth out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> Mat. 4. 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt not live by bread onely, but by every word that proceedeth out of Gods mouth.</hi> If God give not a word of bleſſing, our bread cannot nouriſh us. Hence we are alſo ſaid, <hi>In God to live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore there are natural cauſes, and theſe do produce their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects from a natural neceſſity, yet becauſe they are ſecond cauſes, they do therefore depend upon God the chiefeſt and ſupream cauſe both in <hi>eſſe</hi> and <hi>operari,</hi> in their <hi>being</hi> and <hi>operation.</hi> Thus the fire would not burn, if God ſhould not give concourſe thereunto, as appeareth in the caſe of the three Worthies: and the reaſon which is given by the <hi>Dominicans</hi> (though the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> do not well reliſh it) is that every ſecond cauſe, though it be a natural agent, and ſo determined to operation, yet becauſe it is in a poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality to worke, it hath a <hi>potentia,</hi> a power; this muſt be reduced to act, by that which is the pure and chief act, <hi>viz.</hi> God himſelf. So that it is not enough for God to give a natural power to produce ſuch an effect, unleſſe he alſo actuate that power, and goe along with it. This is a truth, and when believed, will draw off our eyes from the creature more, ſo as to ſet them upon God, and to acknowledge him more in all things. This then thou art to know, That even thoſe natural comforts, which flow from natural cauſes, ſo that it would be a miracle, if they ſhould not produce them, are yet from the goodneſſe and bounty of God. Now how often are we unthankfull for theſe mercies? we doe not bleſſe God
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48709:198"/>
for the gift of ſeeing, the gift of hearing, the gift of walking.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe comforts which flow from moral cauſes, theſe alſo are to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that flow from moral cauſes, are ſtill the gifts of God.</note> 
                  <hi>be attributed to the gift of God.</hi> A man that is diligent in his place, he may grow to be rich. The ſtrongeſt uſually prevail in battel. The ſwifteſt they overcome in a race; yet where theſe moral cauſes are, the effect is Gods gift. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerveth, that the clean contrary falleth out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>Eccleſ. 9. 11. That the battel is not to the ſtrong, nor the race to the ſwift.</hi> How many are diligent, carefull and wiſe in their places, and yet cannot obtain wealth in this world? So that even thoſe things which are brought about by the means that we uſe, we muſt acknowledge they are Gods gift; if his bleſſing be not upon the means, they are fruſtrated. Thus the Lord doth inſtruct <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt any pride and confidence that might ariſe, as if their power and ſtrength did make them rich; <hi>For it is the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that giveth thee power to get wealth,</hi> Deut. 8. 18. You ſee whatſoever wiſdome, diligence, and good husbandry we uſe, yet if any thing come thereby, it is the gift of God. You have a moſt ſignificant place for this truth, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 6. where the Prophet ſheweth, whatever we eat, or drinke, or take care and labour about, the Lord can blaſt it, and make it come to nothing, <hi>Ye eat, but have not enough, ye cloathe you, but there is none warme, and he that earneth wages, it is to put in a bag with holes.</hi> Doth not this Text evidently proclaim, that the labourer in his wages, the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his buying and ſelling, the husbandman in his plowing and ſowing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not adde one farthing to his efface, unleſſe the Lord bleſſe it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>All thoſe comforts we have, and gifts, either to relieve or refreſh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. What we receive from men, 'tis ſtill the gift of God.</note> 
                  <hi>us, that we have from others, we are to account them Gods gifts rather than mens.</hi> If any man help thee in thy neceſſities; if any man preferre and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thee, thou art indeed to be thankfull unto men that are benefactors, but more to God who inclined their hearts to thee: Yet how little is this thought upon, when we receive courteſies from men, kindneſſes from men? we look upon theſe alone: whereas if God did not move their hearts, thou wouldſt have found no relief from them. It was thus with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he was caſt into priſon upon the Kings diſpleaſure, in all outward appearance the Goaler would have uſed him with all cruelty; yet ſaith the Text, <hi>Geneſ. 39. 21. God ſhewed mercy to Joſeph, and gave him favour in the ſight of the keeper of the priſon.</hi> The Lord hath a command over mens hearts; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them mercifull and free to ſome; and again he turneth the hearts of ſome men againſt others. Now we poor creatures look only upon men, as if they did all, as if all were in their power. But as God commanded <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> who was in a rage againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> not to ſpeak an ill word againſt him: So alſo doth the Lord daily, he maketh men thy friends, and he raiſeth them up to be foes. We have likewiſe a notable inſtance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 36. when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were upon their departure, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> though their cruel enemies, who hated and oppreſſed them, yet it's ſaid, <hi>The Lord gave them favour in their eyes, that they lent them even jewels of gold and ſilver.</hi> On the contrary, when God was provoked, it is ſaid, <hi>Pſalm. 105. He turned their heart to his people.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> then ſaid, when <hi>Shimei</hi> reviled him bitterly, <hi>The Lord hath bid him:</hi> So when thou receiveſt any favour, any mercy from men, look up higher than men, The Lord hath bid him. Mens gifts are much rather Gods gifts: yea even what thoſe do for us, who are in the moſt indeared relations, and ſo have principles of nature to inſtigate them to help thee, yet thou art to look upon all their care and love as Gods gift to thee. If thy parents have taken care of thee; if they have provided for thee; if they have looked to thee; though it was their duty, and they would have been unnatural, if they had done otherwiſe, yet do thou look
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48709:199"/>
upon it, as Gods gift to thee. How many parents are given up to unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affections? How many love their luſts and their whores more than their children? So that ſpending all upon their pleaſures, they regard not their children, but leave them in poverty and miſery. Now it's Gods gift to thee informing of thy parents heart to their duties concerning thee. Thus if wives love husbands, love children, all this is Gods gift. <hi>Gerſon</hi> relates of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who deſired to inſtruct him in this, that he had all things from God as a gift, that they made an Engine, whereby deſcended from above whatſoever he deſired, or cried for, as if it came from God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Even thoſe things that are brought about for us, by the art and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Whatſoever we have by the art and skill of others.</note> 
                  <hi>skill of others, as well as their bounty, we are to acknowledge God the giver of them.</hi> Thus if Phyſicians by their art and skill have been a means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thee out of any diſeaſe, thou art to confeſs it Gods gift. It was <hi>Aſa</hi> his great ſinne, <hi>That he relied on the Phyſician in his diſeaſe, more than on God.</hi> And men think themſelves bound to reward the Phyſician, to ſee he hath his fee; but how little do they think to glorifie God, and to give him the praiſes due to his name? It is the midwives care and skill that brings the child into the world: yet we have <hi>David</hi> taking notice of God, as if he alone had done it, <hi>Pſal. 22. 9. Thou art he that took me from my mothers womb; Thou art my God from my mothers belly.</hi> Oh how thankfully, how humbly ſhould we live did we conſider how we are compaſſed about with Gods gifts? Every thing we enjoy is the gift of God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>If all theſe things, that yet ſeem to be the proper effects of ſecond</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Such things as come upon us without our care.</note> 
                  <hi>cauſes, are yet the gifts of God, Then how much more are all thoſe enjoyments, wherein mans wiſdome and power cannot claim any worke at all?</hi> Such are <hi>now all thoſe favours of God in a temporal may, that are caſt upon us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care or providence of ours.</hi> That as God provided a wife for <hi>Adam,</hi> while he was in a ſleep; Thus doth the Lord bring about many providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of love for his children, that they never thought of, that they could not in the leaſt manner imagine. To this head we may referre <hi>Paul</hi>'s mercy in the Text. It might well be called a <hi>gift,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>preſſed above ſtrength,</hi> and had no hope of life, yet even then God did deliver him. Such mercies alſo muſt needs be Gods gifts, which are beſtowed upon us while we are aſleep, while all the ſenſes are locked up; our preſervation then from outward dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, yea, and from many other wayes, which might be our death or ruine, when we have no uſe of reaſon to prevent them, they muſt needs be Gods gift. And laſtly, All the providences of God to us, while little children, having no wit or power to help our ſelves, but expoſed to danger every way, all theſe were the gifts of God. But who doth with thankfulneſſe remember and meditate upon Gods mercies to him, while a little child, when he did eat, and drink, and play, and thought of no God, yet even then did God vouchſafe mercy to him? <hi>David</hi> did acknowledge this, <hi>Pſal. 22. 9. Thou didst make me hope, when I was upon my mothers breſts. David</hi> was a ſucking child then, he could not put forth the actings of hope, or any grace at that time, but <hi>[I]</hi> meaneth God was he that did then ſupport and preſerve him, though he did not know of it. Thus you ſee, that if you let your thoughts runne over all the good things you enjoy, let them come in what channel they can, yet they are all gifts from God. So that we are to overlook all natural cauſes, all means, all men, all our own wiſdome, and labour, and take them from Gods hand alone. That which <hi>David</hi> ſaith in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the creatures, belongeth alſo to man, <hi>Pſal. 104. 27. Theſe all wait upon thee, that thou mayeſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon; That thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them, they gather; thou openeſt thy hand, and they are filled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:48709:199"/>
Now the grounds why they are Gods gifts are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe there is no neceſſity upon God, either natural or moral to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons. Why theſe are all Gods gifts. 1. God is not neceſſitated to give them.</note> 
                  <hi>vouchſafe them to thee.</hi> He is not bound to give th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> life, ſenſes, wealth; there is no natural neceſſity, for he made thee out of his meer good pleaſure, and he made thee a man, whereas thou mightſt have been a Toad or a Serpent. Nor was there any moral neceſſity; thou doeſt not deſerve any thing at Gods hand; thou doeſt not deſerve a morſet of bread, nor a drop of water; therefore all is the meer gift of God. It is his <hi>free gift,</hi> God doth it purely out of his love, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Favours are to be free and naked,</hi> not diſſembled and counterfeited. Thus God having nothing from thee to move him, doth it from himſelf alone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It's Gods gift, <hi>Becauſe thy ſins are ſuch, that he is provoked to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. We have oft forſeited them by our ſins.</note> 
                  <hi>blaſt all thy comforts, to continue them no longer to thee.</hi> As God threatens, <hi>Hoſ. 2. 8, 9. I will take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof.</hi> You ſee God calleth it his corn, and his wine, becauſe he giveth it. Thus all thy mercies are Gods gifts upon a two-fold account, both becauſe he gave them at firſt; and alſo becauſe he continneth them ſtill unto thee, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thy unworthineſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are Gods gifts, <hi>Becauſe we are commanded to pray unto him for them.</hi> In that ſhort ſumme of Petitions our Lord remembers this, when he <note place="margin">3. We are to pray to him for them.</note> directs us, <hi>To pray for our daily bread;</hi> and this the rich man muſt do as well as the poor; a <hi>Dives</hi> that hath his barns full, as well as a <hi>Lazarns</hi> that wants crums. If then we pray to God for it, it is plain, that it is his gift.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation.</hi> Are all the comforts we enjoy, Gods gifts? Then walk more thankfully; Think of God more; do not mind ſecond cauſes and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo much. <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 27. 10. ſaith, <hi>When his father and mother forſook him, then the Lord will take him up. David</hi>'s parents did not forſake him, but he compareth himſelf to a little Infant, expoſed as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and God did take him up to provide for him. Thus we are to regard God more than father or mother. Labour to ſpeak the language of Scripture more: Say, God hath given this, God continueth this; and be diligent to uſe theſe gifts to the honour and glory of the giver, for that is the chief end why he giveth them. Shall God give to thee, and then wilt thou take off from his glory and honour? Provoke not God to repent (as it were) that ever he did thus and thus to thee, as he did about the making of man, and preferring of <hi>Saul.</hi> Thoſe that ſaid, <hi>Their tongues were their own,</hi> Pſal. 12. 4. were thereby encouraged to wickedneſſe; whereas to conſider thy wealth is not thy own, thy health is not thy own, thy eyes, thy tongue, thy body, theſe are not thy own, they are Gods gift. How carefull wouldſt thou be to improve them all for his glory? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Let this grace of God, and his favour to thee, work thankfulneſs in thy life. It is Gods gift, do not then uſe it for ſinne and the devil.</p>

So that the ſenſe ſhould be, <hi>That thanks ſhould be given to God for many respects.</hi> There were many conſiderations in this one mercy, for which they were to bleſs God. Others read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>In the face or preſence of many,</hi> that is, in the publick Congregation, as 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 8. 24. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Before the Churches.</hi> And certainly, though we will not contend for the reading of the words ſo, yet the meaning of <hi>Paul</hi> is, That in their Church-ſocieties, and publick meetings, they ſhould both pray unto God, and praiſe God. But we ſhall pitch upon the ordinary uſe of the word, and underſtand it for as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>By many perſons,</hi> or <hi>by many men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is, <hi>By whom thanks are to be given,</hi> and that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48709:200"/>
                  <hi>By many.</hi> Some do adde the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>That ſeveral wayes,</hi> or, <hi>for many things praiſes may be given to God,</hi> becauſe they think it very redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to have perſons again expreſſed. Some render it <hi>great thankes,</hi> and <hi>eminent praiſes;</hi> but it is moſt conſonant to interpret it of perſons; That the ſame <hi>many,</hi> who did pray for this mercy, were alſo to praiſe God for it.</p>
               <p>Therefore from both theſe joyned together, we may take notice, That <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſimply look at prayers and praiſes, from others ſingly and diſtributive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but as conjoyned and collectively. The prayers of many met together, the praiſes of many aſſembled together, are more acceptable then of one alone. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That not onely perſonal prayers and praiſes, but publick and ſolemn ones per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers and praiſes are acceptable to God.</note> 
                  <hi>by many, are very acceptable together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth from this enlarge himſelf, concerning the great power that a multitude hath, if met in an holy manner to prevail with God. They do (as it were) <hi>put God to ſhame</hi> (that is his expreſſion) he knoweth not how to gain-ſay many, when they knock and importune: whereupon he takes occaſion to ſpeak of the publick Church-prayers that were then made for the <hi>Catechume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noi,</hi> and doth in particular explicate every petition. But we ſhall keep to the Apoſtle, who doth deſire their publick prayers and praiſes, thereby commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profit and efficacy of them.</p>
               <p>To amplifie this, conſider this Caution,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That though God delights in the aſſembling of many, yet they muſt be ſuch as are qualified according to Gods will.</hi> It is not ſimply a multitude that God regardeth. We read of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that in their diſtreſſes, they would make their approaches to God in great troops; yet the Lord abhorred their Sacrifices, becauſe they did not waſh themſelves, nor make them clean, ſo as to put away their iniquities and tranſgreſſions farre from them. If ſo be, the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>That one ſinner deſtroyeth much good,</hi> then how much good do many deſtroy? If one dead flie ſpoil a box of ointment, what will many dead flies do? So that the more aſſembled together in this manner, the more is God provoked. For <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. our meeting muſt be <hi>in Chriſts name;</hi> not onely by his appointment, but alſo in that manner he hath required. Therefore you muſt take the Doctrine thus, Many godly perſons met together, doe more prevaile than ſome few, or one onely: Otherwiſe one <hi>Job,</hi> one <hi>Daniel,</hi> may obtaine more at Gods hand, then many thouſands of wicked men; for they have crying ſinnes which doe out-cry their prayers.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, let us conſider, Why publick duties are to be preferred <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> before private. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe hereby the glory and honour of God is more promoted.</hi> If the <note place="margin">1. Hereby the honour of God is more promoted.</note> multitude of Subjects be the glory of a King, then alſo is the multitude of true and ſpiritual worſhippers the glory of God. Hence <hi>David</hi> doth profeſſe, <hi>That he will bleſſe God in the great Congregation,</hi> Pſal. 22. 25. and <hi>Pſal. 26. 12. Pſal.</hi> 40. 9, 10. The greater the Congregation is, if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified, the more honour cometh to God. Hence it is that in the Old Teſtament God commanded ſet dayes for all the people to meet together, and worſhip God. And in the New Teſtament, we have frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Churches meeting together to worſhip God. Inſomuch that it is a very ſinfull reaſoning which ſome have, What ſhould they goe to Church for? They can ſtay at home, and read of a good book, and ſo get as much good. Oh but know, ô vain man! Though that ſhould be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48709:201"/>
which yet is not, that thou couldſt profit as much, yet thou oweſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory, and worſhip to God, and that in the Congregation. Do not the Angels in multitudes praiſe God together? Why is it called a <hi>Church,</hi> but becauſe many are to have communion together? So that unleſſe God doth diſpenſe with thee, that he will have no honour or glory from thee, it is thy ſinne, if not otherwiſe neceſſarily detained, voluntarily to abſent from theſe publick Ordinances. The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. doth reprove the manner of ſome in thoſe dayes, who did not <hi>aſſemble themſelves together.</hi> You ſee even in the Apoſtles dayes the Devil tempted ſome in this kind; yet they are reproved, though private Chriſtians in thoſe dayes had greater gifts, and abilities then now ordinarily men have; yea they are reproved, though ſome think the cauſe was not voluntary, but that it was fear of danger and perſecution. It was criminal to meet together, and therefore fear of death, and other miſeries might make ſome forbear to aſſemble themſelves; yet for all this they are cenſured by the Apoſtle. Let this then be laid to heart by thee: look that no reaſon keep thee from this publick worſhip of God, but what God himſelf will allow of: For in ſome caſes God hath condeſcended that his own worſhip ſhall rather be omitted, then mens neceſſities not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As God is more honoured, ſo hereby <hi>The love and charity of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Hereby our love to one another is much quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</note> 
                  <hi>the people of God is greatly quickened to one another.</hi> This publick and holy meeting together, is a ſpecial means to enflame the affections of one believer to another. Hence you have it ſo often noted, <hi>That the Diſciples met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with one accord, and they had one heart.</hi> And therefore diverſities of opinions and alienation of affections, do cauſe commonly a publick rent and diviſion in Church-ſocieties. <hi>David</hi> doth with affection expreſſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the publick Ordinances, <hi>We went to the houſe of the Lord, and we took ſweet counſel together,</hi> Pſal. 55. 14. This is the viſible communion of the Saints, wherein as members of the ſame body, they are ſo firmly and nearly compacted together. There is nothing that the Devil doth ſo much deſign, as rents, ſchiſmes and differences in the Church of God, knowing that theſe, if not healed, will certainly deſtroy all at laſt. Now a right and orderly meeting in theſe publick Aſſemblies, are a ſpecial means to preſerve love. How ſhall thoſe mouths ſpeak againſt one another, that joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to pray to God, and to praiſe God? You that called upon one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Brethren, How ſhall ye diſagree, as if one had not the ſame God, and the ſame Father with another? Therefore our Saviour directs to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> not <hi>my Father;</hi> hereby commanding our publick meetings together, and alſo our union and brotherly love.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore are theſe publick duties to be the more prized, Becauſe of Gods ſpecial preſence and power there.</hi> Mat. 18. You have a peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <note place="margin">3. God in a more eſpecial manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there.</note> 
                  <hi>for two or three meeting together in Chriſts name,</hi> even as by way of type, God had promiſed his peculiar preſence in the Temple. And for this reaſon you have <hi>David</hi> with ſuch ardent and paſſionate affections expreſſing his eſteem of the Ordinances of God, <hi>Pſal. 63. 1, 2. My ſoul thirſteth, and my fleſh longeth as in a dry land, where no water is, to ſee thy power.</hi> And at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, <hi>How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hoſts?</hi> And, <hi>As the Hart panteth after the brooks, ſo doth his ſoul after God</hi> in the Ordinances. Though <hi>David</hi> when he was baniſhed, and by force could not come to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation, no doubt did enjoy God in a moſt comfortable and full manner, yet ſtill he is not ſatisfied, but breaths for his preſence in thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. And therefore for thee to think, that thou mayeſt meet God as well at home, is as if a cripple ſhould have looked to be healed by going into ſome other water, then that of the pool of <hi>Betheſda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:48709:201"/>
Laſtly, Theſe publick Ordinances are therefore to be highly eſteemed, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who are quickened and enlivened, may prevail for thoſe who are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Herein the lively may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for the dull and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed.</note> 
                  <hi>indispoſed and unfit for prayer.</hi> So that the coldneſſe and dulneſſe of one man may be ſupplied by the zeal and fervency of another. Inſomuch that happily the prayer, which if performed by thy own ſelf, would not be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull, being now joyned with others, doth obtain its deſired effect; yea it may be in that publick ſervice, when thou through temptations canſt or dareſt not pray for thy ſelf; others accompanying of thee, do put up thy own thoughts, and ſpeak the deſires of thy own heart: So that thou art even aſtoniſhed to ſee, how God ordereth the gracious gifts of others to be helpfull unto thee. As it was with <hi>Job,</hi> his whole body, though full of ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and pains, yet becauſe his mouth was free, that could plead with God in behalf of the whole body; Thus it may be, when many are gathered together, that Chriſtian who could not ſpeak for it ſelf, which could not pray for it ſelf, findeth the hearts and mouths of others opened in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. So that as when many coals are laid together, ſome live ones may revive thoſe that are ready to decay: Thus the zeale of others may helpe thy coldneſſe: The life of others may quicken thee up againſt deadneſſe; and thou find that ſpiritual heat come upon thee from others, which thou wouldſt not have had alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation,</hi> To prize theſe publick Aſſemblies more than thou haſt done. Pray for ſuch ſtrong and earneſt affections, as thou findeſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> manifeſting after them. Oh let theſe publick meetings raiſe up thy heart, as if thou were in Heaven! The beholding of the faces, of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and of the graces of others, let it aſſimilate thee alſo into them. As when <hi>Saul</hi> came among the Prophets, the ſpirit of prophecy fell upon him likewiſe. Oh let the Congregation of thoſe who feare God worke upon thee alſo! Be in theſe Aſſemblies, as <hi>Peter</hi> on the Mount of transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying in an holy exceſſe of ſpirit, <hi>It is good to be here.</hi> What high expreſſions are thoſe of <hi>David,</hi> in reference to the ſolemne Ordinances? <hi>Pſal. 65. 4. Bleſſed is the man thou chooſeſt, and cauſeſt to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy Courts; we ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſſe of thy houſe, even of thy holy Temple.</hi> Here is ſweetneſſe and fullneſſe that the people of God find in theſe publick approaches. All the merry meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, all the fairs and markets, are nothing to this ſpiritual ſociety. And <hi>Pſalm. 84. 10. A day in thy Courts, is better than a thouſand otherwhere.</hi> Hence he had rather be a <hi>door-keeper in the houſe of God, then dwell in the tents of wickedneſſe.</hi> Oh heavenly and gracious frame! A Sabbath day is better than all the dayes of the week, he hath more rejoycing there, then a thouſand dayes can afford that are ſpent in worldly affaires. But when theſe publick duties are thus advanced (as you hear) you muſt alwayes look, that they be done holily, ſpiritually, fervently, that they be not turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a meer cuſtome and external faſhion, as it too often falleth out in Church-aſſemblies, their bodies are preſent, but their ſouls are abſent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have no more than the carkaſſe and out-ſide. Such prayers and praiſes God will not accept.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt particular is to be ſpoken to in a word; and that is, In whoſe behalf theſe publick prayers and praiſes are, and that is ſaid, <hi>In our behalfe.</hi> Some Copies have read it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but that is not probable. It is then for that deliverance vouchſafed to <hi>Paul,</hi> that they are to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and the reaſon is clear, becauſe mercies vouchſafed to <hi>Paul,</hi> were their mercies alſo. From whence obſerve,</p>

                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:48709:202"/>
                  <hi>That the mercies vouchſafed to the paſtors and guides of the Church, are</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What advantage comes to the ſhepherd, it redounds to the ſheep. The rain that fals upon the mountains, deſcendeth to the benefit of the valleys. Your life, your comfort is bound up in theirs. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed ſaid, <hi>We live, if you ſtand faſt.</hi> It was his comfort, his life, to ſee them preſerved from Apoſtaſie by perſecution, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 8. And on the contrary, the Church may ſay of her guides, We ſtand faſt, if you live. As mercies to the publick Magiſtrates are to be accounted the peoples mercies; ſo the mercies of Church-officers are to be reckoned the Churches. If the Pilotes be in danger, it can never be well with the ſhip. When <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken away, the cry was, <hi>The chariots of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof.</hi> So great a mercy was one Prophet accounted to be. We have a notable inſtance of the holy care of the <hi>Philippians</hi> about their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> Phil. 2. 26, 27. when he was ſick unto death, how heavily did they lay it to heart? Inſomuch that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was exceedingly grieved, that they had heard of his being ſick, he knew it would ſo greatly afflict them. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> accounted it a mercy to him alſo, that God did heal him. For though <hi>Paul</hi> did recover many out of their diſeaſes, yet this gift was not when they pleaſed, and it was leaſt of all extended to thoſe that were of their intimate acquaintance, but rather to ſuch as were brought to them, that ſo the truth of their miracles might be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction.</hi> How happy and bleſſed a thing it is, when people are able to do their duty herein; To look upon all the favours and good providences of God to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as their own mercies; their health, encouragements, preſervations, as their owne; but how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly doth <hi>Satan</hi> fill the hearts of ſome men, who out of love to their luſts, and their errours, look upon their godly guides, as the greateſt burthens, and would heartily rejoyce in any evil that ſhould befall them? This is clean contrary to thoſe gracious, loving and indeared affections, which ought to be in people to their ſpiritual ſhepherds.</p>

               <p>THis verſe (as appeareth by the raciocinative particular, or note of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>For)</hi> is brought in as a reaſon of ſomething which went before. But Interpreters do differ about the coherence thereof. Some make this to be a reaſon of that hope and truſt he formerly ſpake of, which he had in God. Though he did truſt in Gods mercies, yet not in them alone, but in his own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours alſo. Hence <hi>Aquinas</hi> from this ſaith, <hi>That hope doth ariſe from the mercy of God, and mans merits.</hi> But this doth not conſiſt with Scripture. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do make it part of his Apologetical Narration, defending himſelf, as againſt that crime of inconſtancy and levity, which was caſt upon him, becauſe of his promiſe to come to them, which yet he did not; and therefore they think theſe words look backward, and not forward. <hi>Calvin</hi> and others (which is moſt probable) referre it to the words immediately preceding, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praiſes to God in his behalf.</hi> This is given as a reaſon, why they ſhould be thus tender about him, becauſe he had obtained grace to be faithfull; he had not ſought himſelf, or his own glory; he had not walked in hypocriſie and fraud, but had been kept by the grace of God in all ſincerity in his converſation in the world, not only at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but every where elſe. Now it is a great motive and encouragement to pray for ſuch. The Apoſtle uſeth this argument, <hi>Heb. 13. 18. Pray for us, for we truſt we have a good conſcience in all things.</hi>

               <p>Now though <hi>Paul</hi> did not put confidence and truſt in his good and ſincere conſcience, yet from the perceiving of that, he did rejoyce. Whereas then we ſee <hi>Paul</hi> rejoycing and glorying from the teſtimony and evidence of that grace he had in him. We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That an holy glorying, and rejoycing in the graces of God, we perceive in us,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">An holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and glorying in the graces of God is lawfull.</note> 
                  <hi>is allowed and lawfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>an holy glorying,</hi> for the heart may quickly degenerate into a proud ſinfull boaſting. Therefore this truth muſt be warily bounded: So that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and tempted ſoul, may be quickned to its duty of comfort, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the work of grace that it may feel, and the proud phariſaical ſpirit may be debaſed. The valley muſt be exalted, and the mountain made low. It is true indeed, we have the Scripture ſaying, <hi>Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord. Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 31, And if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not wherewith to glory, who can have? Yea the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Rom. 3. 27. That glorying is excluded by the law of faith.</hi> But in what ſenſe this is to be underſtood, will appear, when we come to manifeſt, how many wayes it is not lawfull to glory, or to rejoyce, no not in our gifts and graces. Only this Text maketh it plain, that in ſome ſenſe our graces may be matter of glory and rejoycing to us. So likewiſe <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. the Apoſtle preſſing every man to try his own works, to examine his intentions therein, giveth this as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent fruit thereof, <hi>That then he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelf,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a kind of <hi>glorying</hi> and <hi>boaſting in himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To clear this truth, let us firſt ſhew what is <hi>required</hi> to this glorying, and then <note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in the gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have received from God. 1. An high eſteem of our graces.</note> in what reſpects it is <hi>lawfull</hi> and allowed us. And for the former,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is neceſſary to this rejoycing and glorying, in the firſt place, <hi>That we have an high eſteem of the excellency and worth of that grace we diſcover to be in us.</hi> If ſo be we are to rejoyce in theſe outward mercies, which yet are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the body, what matter of joy ſhould it be, to find thoſe ſpiritual workings of Gods Spirit in us, which are of eternal concernment? What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith concerning the eſteem of wiſdom, which is indeed nothing but grace, we ſhould all make good, <hi>Prov. 2. 4. If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her, as for hid treaſures.</hi> That ſoul then, which can rejoyce in the diſcovery of grace, muſt eſteem of it more than all the treaſures of the world: To ſay, O Lord, I had rather find my ſelf ſanctified, I had rather ſee the powerfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grace upon me, then to be made the greateſt or richeſt man in the world; we have many exhortations to examine our ſelves, and try our hearts, to ſee if we can find this precious jewel in our ſouls. Now none will be cordial to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and ſearch herein, but thoſe who look upon it as the greateſt treaſure. Did the woman in the Goſpel make ſuch diligent ſearch for <hi>a loſt groat</hi> only, and call her neighbours to rejoyce with her, when ſhe had found it? How large and boundleſs then ſhould our thoughts be about the excellency of grace? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the godly ſoul this is the great queſtion it labours to ſtudy, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, Whether it be in the ſtate of grace or no, knowing that this onely is the moſt bleſſed and happy eſtate in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As we muſt highly eſteem this work of grace, ſo we muſt have a <note place="margin">2. A certain perſwaſion that we have them.</note> 
                  <hi>Certainty and perſwaſion that we have obtained it.</hi> Had not <hi>Paul</hi> known, that his heart had been ſincere, that he was not acted by carnal wiſdome, he could
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:48709:203"/>
never have rejoyced. For Philoſophers make joy to be in that <hi>good thing we do poſſeſſe,</hi> and alſo the <hi>knowledge</hi> thereof. This Text then doth abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the people of God may have a certain knowledge of the work of grace. So that although the heart be indeed deceitfull and full of hypocriſie, yet when ſanctified, it hath ſome meaſure of truth and ſincerity in it, and ſo far doth not deceive us. He then that would rejoyce in the grace of God wrought in him, muſt preſſe after aſſurance, muſt endeavour after a certain perſwaſion of the truth of grace in him. And although this perſwaſion be not juſtifying faith, yea it is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from it. A man may be juſtified, may be ſanctified, and not know it, yet it is ſuch a priviledge, yea and duty alſo, that we ſhould diligently take heed of all thoſe things, that may weaken our aſſurance, that may make us to doubt and queſtion, whether Jeſus Chriſt be in us or no.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>A ſure perſwaſion of the goodneſſe and integrity of our hearts, is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Good grounds and Scripture-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations thereof.</note> 
                  <hi>not enough, but it muſt be upon right grounds, and in a Scripture-demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For if it be a falſe perſwaſion, it may produce indeed a rejoycing, but a falſe rejoycing alſo. It is more than probable, that <hi>Paul</hi> while a perſecutor, being zealouſly affected to the tradition of his fathers, and thinking himſelf bound (as he profeſſeth) to do what he did againſt Chriſt and his members, could then ſay, <hi>His rejoycing was the teſtimony of his conſcience,</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that in thoſe wayes he glorified God: And therefore ſome do extend that profeſſion of his before the Council, <hi>That he had lived in all good conſcience before God untill that day.</hi> And if this be ſo, then we ſee plainly, That every perſwaſion, though never ſo confident, is not enough to make us rejoyce; but we muſt look to Scripture-grounds. Doth not experience confirm this? Take any heretical perſon, any erroneous perſon, though it be to the deſtruction of the very fundamentals of Religion, yet he will proclaim a rejoycing in his heart, from the good teſtimony of his conſcience. So that an erroneous conſcience ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, doth bring peace and rejoycing, but it is an erroneous joy. It is either from meer humane principles, or from diabolical deluſions. But this will come in more properly, when we come to the ground or reaſon it ſelf of <hi>Paul's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To this rejoycing there is required, <hi>The Spirit of God enabling</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. The Spirit of God.</note> 
                  <hi>us thereunto.</hi> So that the ſame ſpirit, which doth ſeal to us the aſſurance of our eſtate, doth alſo cauſe comfort in us. The Spirit of God doth enlighten and ſanctifie, after this it doth ſeal and comfort. And this latter work of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is neceſſary, as well as the other. For we ſee it lieth not in the power of Gods people to have comfort when they will. Hence <hi>Gal. 5. Joy</hi> is the fruit of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and it's called <hi>Joy in the holy Ghoſt;</hi> not only objectively, becauſe it is a joy in ſpiritual objects; but alſo efficiently, becauſe it is wrought by him. Hence it is that the Spirit of God mouldeth the heart for comfort, removeth fears and doubts, reſtraineth and keepeth off Satan, whereby no ſinne, no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is able to deject and caſt down, becauſe God comforteth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Thus you ſee what goeth to rejoycing in the graces of God, and thereby an holy glorying in them.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee in what reſpect it is lawfull thus to rejoyce. And <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect 'tis law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thus to rejoyce and glory. 1. As they are the fruits of Gods favour.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is lawfull to rejoyce in them, as they are the effects and fruits of Gods favour and love, as they ſignifie the cauſe from whence they come. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> could not but rejoyce to ſee the thread that was a ſigne of ſuch a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy deſigned for her. If then the godly man have that ſpiritual skill, as to differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between truſting in his graces, as any way cauſes of his ſalvation, and thankfully receiving them asſignes, from which he may be perſwaded of it, then doth he hit the mark. It is uſually ſaid from <hi>Luther, That we are to take heed not onely of evil deeds, but of good and holy works alſo,</hi> becauſe the heart is apt to be carried away with pride and ſelf-confidence inſenſibly, yet this much
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48709:204"/>
not ſo deterre the people of God, that they may not take comfort from their graces. For how can they ſee them, and not rejoyce, becauſe they are the pledge of Gods favour it ſelf, and of an intereſt in Chriſt? So that though their graces be weak, and full of imperfections, yet they manifeſt that to be ours, which is fully perfect, and hath no fault at all in it. Imperfect graces do manifeſt Gods perfect grace to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We may rejoyce in them ſo farre as thereby to bear up our hearts</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. As they bear up our hearts againſt all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther external or internal.</note> 
                  <hi>againſt all accuſations, whether internally from Satan, or externally from the malice of men.</hi> Is there any greater temptation in the world, then that when Satan accuſeth the children of God, that they are hypocrites, that there is no truth of grace in them, that what they do is not from a right principle, but ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking? Even as he accuſed <hi>Job</hi> to God, that he ſerved God for carnal ends, becauſe God had hedged him about; but if he were touched in theſe things, and ſtript of them, then he would betray his hypocriſie. Now it is lawfull for the children of God to defie theſe accuſations of Satan; to rejoyce in the ſenſe of their uprigtneſs, though the Devil rage at it. While he roareth, do thou be glad and praiſe God. Oh how often are believers ſhaken in this very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar! They are afraid to own what God hath done for them; they think it their humility and lowlineſs thus to be in doubts, and to be perplexed with fears, not remembring how neceſſary it is, to acknowledge thankfully what God hath done for us, and to walk with joy, triumphing over all the fiery darts of Satan. It is the great blame of Chriſts Diſciples, that they do not more glory and rejoyce in this reſpect. And then</p>
               <p n="2">2. This rejoycing is lawfull, when we have to do with <hi>malicious enemies,</hi> that are ready to charge us with hypocriſie and ſelf-ſeeking, that for all our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretences, we have rotten and earthly hearts; then is a time for thee to make uſe of rejoycing in the ſincerity of thy ſoul. And this indeed is one great part of the Apoſtles meaning. The falſe Apoſtles they calumniated him, they made the cauſe of all his afflictions and troubles to be his evil life, and Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon him. Now the Apoſtle hath this brazen wall within, as the <hi>Heathen</hi> called it, <hi>He hath the witneſſe of a good conſcience.</hi> As <hi>Auſtin</hi> to <hi>Secundinus, Senti de</hi> Auguſtino <hi>quid velis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Think of</hi> Auſtin <hi>what you will, ſo that my own conſcience doth not condemn me.</hi> This rejoycing therefore is neceſſarily ſeen in this particular.</p>
               <p>In the third place, Let us ſee, wherein this <hi>rejoycing</hi> in our graces may be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wherein this rejoycing is unlawfull. 1. When we rejoyce in our graces, as if they were perfect.</note> And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is when we dare rejoyce, and that in the ſight of God, as if there were no blemiſh or damnable matter in them.</hi> To rejoyce as Perfectioniſts do in their holineſs, daring to hold it up to God himſelf in his ſtrict juſtice, this is highly provoking God. Hence this Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4. Though he regarded not mens judgement concerning him, becauſe he knew nothing by himſelf, yet he ſaith, <hi>He was not thereby juſtified, becauſe it was God that judgeth:</hi> God that knew more evil, and ſaw more ſinne in him, then he could do in himſelf. Therefore though we may rejoyce in them, yet take heed of oppoſing them to the ſtrict and righteous judgement of God. And it is in this ſenſe, that <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. ſaith, <hi>All boaſting is excluded;</hi> and that <hi>Abraham</hi> in the matter of juſtification, <hi>had not wherewith to boaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is not lawfull to rejoyce in them, as if they had any inherent dignity or worth to reſt upon.</hi> When we approach to God, we muſt reſt alone upon <note place="margin">2. When we ſo rejoyce in them, as so reſt upon them.</note> Gods grace, as the efficient cauſe, and Chriſt as the meritorious cauſe. Theſe are the only foundation we can build upon. When therefore we have given Gods grace, and Chriſts merits their full due, then may we rejoyce in our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is true, we read of <hi>Hezekiah, David, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> here, as alſo in other places, pleading even in prayer their righteouſneſs, and deſiring
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:48709:204"/>
God to remember them, and not wipe out their good deeds. But theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are partly in ſome particular, wherein they were innocent, as in <hi>David:</hi> Or elſe they onely plead theſe, as the qualifications in them, to which Gods promiſes are made; they are ſuch to whom God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed his promiſes; and therefore they may plead them in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this ſenſe; otherwiſe to urge them, as having dignity, they could not. For at that very time <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prayeth, God would ſpare him, and have mercy on him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We muſt not rejoyce in theſe graces, as if we had them of our ſelves, as</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. When we rejoyce in them as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our ſelves, not God</note> 
                  <hi>if they were not the gift of God.</hi> Therefore <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s note upon the place is dangerous, ſaying, <hi>The reaſon why this good conſcience is called glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is, becauſe we obtain it by our own ſtrength; otherwiſe it would not be our glorying.</hi> But the Apoſtle directly oppoſeth this, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Why doeſt thou glory, as if thou hadst not received?</hi> But you may then ſay, The Papiſts are not to be found fault with in their rejoycing in their good works, for they make them the gifts of Gods grace, and preſuppoſe Chriſts merits. But this will not acquit them. For the Apoſtle maketh that a contradiction, <hi>If of grace, then not of workes:</hi> It cannot be of grace and works together. Beſides, they make grace only an univerſal cauſe, and our own will to be the particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining cauſe, and thereby give much more to that, then the grace of God. If then we take heed of theſe three rocks, we are allowed to rejoyce in our graces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe 1. Of ſevere and ſharp reproof,</hi> to ſuch, who do indeed <hi>rejoyce,</hi> but it is <hi>in their lusts,</hi> in <hi>the pleaſures of ſinne,</hi> which is to rejoyce in their ſhame, and that which will be terrour and torment to them. What can theſe wretches ſay? But our rejoycing is an evil and a ſeared conſcience, that we have lived in all prophaneneſs and impiety? Oh remember into what howling and gnaſhing of teeth theſe ſhort pleaſures will at laſt be changed!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe 2. Of Admonition to the godly,</hi> to take this rejoycing which God doth allow them. Why do they ſtand aloof off, and trembling? Why do they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh doubts and fears? Why will ye not own what God hath done for you? Take an holy boldneſs, call that grace, which is grace. Let not the Devil and thy fears diſpute thee out of what thou art. Be not ſo eaſily baffled and driven out of thy integrity. Becauſe hypocrites do deceive themſelves, do the ſincere alſo?

               <p>Let us conſider this as it is in the general ſet down. Concerning the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, alſo the nature of the conſcience, what it is, I have elſewhere at large ſhewed. It is enough to re-mind you of thus much, That in the Old Teſtament it is generally called the <hi>heart,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Davids heart ſmote him,</hi> that is, <hi>his conſcience</hi> did witneſſe againſt him, and condemn him. And becauſe of that <hi>remorſus,</hi> that regreting and diſplicency which conſcience putteth forth, <hi>Durand</hi> is ſingular in his opinion, holding that the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal underſtanding is not the conſcience only, but the will likewiſe is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it. The Hebrew word <hi>Leb,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>Heart,</hi> doth alſo original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denote the ſprinkling of the meal with leaven: Thus the heart hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſome principles in it, which are like leaven to it, as ſpeculative and practical axiomes concerning God, and juſt, and unjuſt. In the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment likewiſe it is called <hi>the heart,</hi> 1 John 3. 20. <hi>If our heart condemne us,</hi> (that is, our conſcience) <hi>God is greater than our heart.</hi> But no more of this here.</p>
               <p>This conſcience is here deſcribed by one ſpecial act it hath, and that is, <hi>To bear witneſſe,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The word in the Scripture is commonly uſed for that publick teſtimony and witneſs, which either God did give unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by miracles and ſignes, or men by their publick profeſſion and atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1. the Goſpel is called the <hi>teſtimony of God,</hi> becauſe ſo wonderfully confirmed by him: So to men it is applied, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 3. The Apoſtles with great power gave witneſſe of the Reſurrection of Chriſt; and becauſe believers by their deaths did give the greateſt teſtimony to the truths of God, hence they are called <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and their death is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Conſcience is a God to every man.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth an equivalent expreſſion in other places, <hi>Rom. 1. 9. Phil. 1. 8. God is my witneſſe. Salmeron</hi> out of <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks of a two-fold teſtimony of the conſcience, <hi>Teſtimonium conſcientiae perhibentis,</hi> that which the <hi>conſcience</hi> doth <hi>actively exhibit;</hi> and <hi>Conſcientiae percipientis,</hi> that which it doth <hi>receive from the Spirit of God,</hi> of which we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. and in this later ſenſe he underſtands it: But we take both in, <hi>viz.</hi> that witneſs which the conſcience did actually give of <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſincerity. But becauſe this could not be done without the Spirit of God inabling thereunto, therefore it is a witneſſe received from Gods Spirit firſt, and from that conſcience is enabled to deliver it to us.</p>
               <p>Now when ſo much rejoycing is attributed to the teſtimony of conſcience, you muſt take along with you, who it is that ſpeaketh thus, <hi>The teſtimony of our conſcience,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſanctified, enlightned, and guided by the Word; otherwiſe there is a teſtimony of a <hi>deluded conſcience,</hi> of a <hi>ſecure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> that ſpeaketh peace, when there is no peace; and this doth not afford any true or ſolid ground of rejoycing; it muſt be therefore the teſtimony of ſuch a conſcience, which <hi>Paul</hi> had. And ſo obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the witneſſe of our conſcience rightly guided in acquitting of us, is a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The witneſſe of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is great ground of comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>ground of unspeakable comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that hath his conſcience rightly clearing of him, he need not care for all the accuſations of the Devils in hell, and wicked men upon the earth. It breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth confidence both towards God and towards men. Towards God, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 21. If our hearts condemn us not, we have confidence towards God, and whatſoever we aske, we receive of him.</hi> This encourageth and imboldeneth in prayer. And towards men: As you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> juſtified himſelf by this, when called before the Council, and made to plead for himſelf, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 1. Yea the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> though they could never attain to a true ſpiritually ſanctified conſcience, yet not to live according to the natural dictates thereof, they accounted the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happineſſe, <hi>Nil conſcire ſibi</hi>—was the onely thing that made happy. And <hi>Hic murus aheneus eſto. Pindar</hi> called it, <hi>The good nurſe in our old age.</hi> So great a matter is it to have the teſtimony of a good conſcience, void of offence, for that is <hi>Mille teſtes,</hi> more than all the teſtimonies in the world.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore men have ſuch conſtant recourſe to this witneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> and their comfort is true or falſe, according as that is guided; Let us enquire firſt into the conſtituent or ingredient qualities, of a rightly guided conſcience. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>There is neceſſarily required to a good and true teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. That it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs according to the word of God.</note> 
                  <hi>That it take the word of God as a Rule to judge by, to witneſſe by, to accuſe by, and to acquit by.</hi> The conſcience of a man is not the ſupream rule, but an inferiour; and therefore is <hi>Regula regulata,</hi> as well as <hi>Regula regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans,</hi> a rule to be ruled by an higher rule, which is the Scripture. <hi>To the Law, to the teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20. If a man pretend to never ſo much light within, if he rejoyceth never ſo much in the light that he hath, yet if it be not from the light of the Word, if it be not examined, tried and judged to be according to that
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:48709:206"/>
it is but a falſe light, a light that will end in darkneſs. So then, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be a teſtimony, yet you ſee that bath another teſtimony to be guided by; though it be a Law in a man, yet there is a ſuperiour Law to that, which is the word of God. By this you may ſee, what a rotten foundation they have to build their comforts upon, who take up other rules for their conſcience, beſides the Scripture. Theſe joyes are all but like the morning-dew. Some make their rule in Religion, to be the tradition of their Fathers. The Papiſt doth ſo extoll tradition, that they think that alone without Scripture is ſtarre bright enough to guide us. <hi>Paul</hi>'s zeal while a perſecutor ſeemed to be grounded much upon this, becauſe they were the traditions of his fathers. And truly tradition is the greateſt reaſon of moſt mens faith, whether it be in a right way, or a true. But this is an improper foundation for thy faith. As thy faith is hereby a blind faith, ſo thy comfort is but a blind comfort. How greatly do the <hi>Popiſh Caſuiſts</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex their people with ſuch caſes of conſcience, and about ſuch ſuperſtitious things, that they have only tradition for, and that it may be not many yeares neither, without any ſtamp or ſuperſcription of the Scripture? Have not they comfort in their Penances, in their Indulgences? Will not their Friers and Monks (not thoſe ſlow beaſts and idle bellies) who from deluded principles of conſcience, do ſeverely and auſteerly mortifie themſelves, ſay, <hi>They have the teſtimony of their conſciences,</hi> and make a bulwark from thence? But where is the rule they go by? Is it not tradition? On the contrary ſide, in another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, there is the <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> who rejecteth the Scripture as a dead letter, and doth adhere only to revelations, to pretended workings of Gods Spirit, to the manifeſt light within them: Doe not theſe even boaſt in their joyes and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhments? Doe they not, when unable to anſwer arguments, flie to a light within them? But what ground is there for this? Is not the Apoſtles command, <hi>That we ſhould not believe every ſpirit, but try them?</hi> 1 John 4. 1. And how muſt that be but by the Scripture? You ſee then, that it is not conſcience ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and alone, but a Scripture-conſcience that is the ground of comfort. To leave that, and to truſt in our conſcience, is to make our conſciences a Bible, to attribute infallibility to our ſelves. Now this Scrigture is not only a Rule for our conſcience in matters of faith, but alſo of manners, of righteouſneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man. Conſcience muſt witneſs to thee, not only that thou art in the true Religion, but alſo doeſt walk in holy converſation. It muſt teſtifie of thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs towards man, as well as of Religion towards God. This was <hi>Paul's continual exerciſe,</hi> Act. 24. 26. <hi>To have a conſcience void of offence towards God, and towards man.</hi> There are many voluminous Tractates of Caſes of Conſcience, <hi>De jure &amp; juſtitiâ,</hi> Of <hi>Righteouſneſſe towards man.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scripture doth not particularly decide Law-caſes, yet it layeth down ſuch general rules, that by them particulars may eaſily be decided, if our hearts were not corrupt. As for example, that famous rule, <hi>What you would have men do to you; do ye to them,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. Our Saviour after he had given religious precepts about prayer; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he addeth this, to ſhew that Religion and righteouſneſs muſt alwayes go together. And <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this Rule, ſaying, He had it from the Jews or Chriſtians, that he commanded it to be written on the doors and gates of his Palace; and before he would puniſh any offender, would inform him of this Rule. And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>This is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> A great expreſſion. Look then to thy conſcience, that it take the Scripture for a Rule in its adequate nature. For faith and converſation, this is no rule for conſcience to go by. Others do ſay, every <note place="margin">2. The help of the Spirit to inſtruct us in the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</note> one is to look to himſelf; but the word of God that muſt bear evidence to thee by thy conſcience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To the right guidance of our conſcience, in witneſſing to us, there is not only required the Word as a Rule, <hi>But the Spirit of God to enlighten thy
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:48709:206"/>
mind to receive the true meaning thereof.</hi> Such are the powerfull deluſions of Satan, that when he can no longer dethrone the Scripture from its authority, but men will appeal to that, then he looketh about to advance his Kingdom by the Scriptures ill handled, and wreſted to corrupt opinions; and by this means men are brought into a worſe condition, and more incurable then thoſe who walk by no Scripture at all. For if a man be delivered up to this perſwaſion, that his opinions and wayes are allowed by Scripture, warranted by Scripture, what way ſhall we take to reduce him? The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us of ſome <hi>unſtable and unlearned men,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16. <hi>which did wreſt the Scriptures to their own perdition;</hi> And nothing is more ordinary, which made <hi>Luther</hi> ſay, <hi>That the Bible was the Hereticks book;</hi> not in the ſenſe the Papiſts do, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it thereby of inſufficiency and imperfection: But for the dignity of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch authority, that every Heretick would gladly runne to this Sanctuary. The Scripture then, though a perfect Rule, yet is not enough to guide our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, unleſs the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> as is promiſed, <hi>lead us into truth;</hi> As the Sunne, though never ſo full of light, yet cannot guide a blind man. We grant indeed that the Scripture is but a <hi>dead letter,</hi> and of it ſelf without Gods Spirit, doth not enlighten the mind, and convert the heart. Only we ſay, The Spirit doth this, in and by the Scripture, and that all mens conſciences, impulſes, light, revelations and joyes, muſt be examined, and ſtand or fall according to this Rule. Let this be granted, and then we plead as fervently as any can, for the work of Gods Spirit. This muſt enlighten the conſcience, to be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and believe the things revealed there. Hence the Diſciples could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their office, of publiſhing the Goſpel, without this aſſiſtance from the holy Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. he is ſaid, <hi>To guid them into all truth. To guide them,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this ſignifieth that they did not know the way; or if they were in, they would quickly divert into by-paths, if this Spirit did not guide them. When <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Word was a lamp and light to his feet:</hi> If we underſtand it effectually, ſo that it did not only propound the light obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, but that alſo he was ſubjectively thereby illuminated, this doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily preſuppoſe the work of Gods Spirit. No wonder then, if ſo many may be exceedingly acquainted with Scripture, be ready with ſome Texts upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion, yet for all that be deluded with errours, becauſe they want Gods Spirit to enlighten them, and inſtruct them thereby. Let us look upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> the ſad deſt object in the world at this day; they have been ſo skilfull in the Old Teſtament, that ſome could remember how many words and ſyllables were therein, and that is read to them daily; yet who more maliciouſly oppoſite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord Chriſt, promiſed in the Old Teſtament, than they are? But the Scripture giveth a full reaſon thereof, <hi>The veil is upon their eyes.</hi> And long before there was ſuch a prediction of this ſpiritual judgement upon them, <hi>That ſeeing they ſhould not ſee, hearing not hear, leſt they underſtand and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi> Therefore to have a pure and true conſcience, we muſt be ſure to pray and exerciſe our ſelves herein, that the Spirit of God would direct us into the true ſenſe and meaning of the Word, which is to be expected in the holy uſe of thoſe means which are neceſſary to find out the ſenſe thereof. For you muſt not expect that Gods Spirit will immediately reveal the ſenſe of the Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other helps, no more than he will make you underſtand Greek and Hebrew. Know then, it is a very ſad, and almoſt incurable condition, when the holy Scriptures do become a ſnare to us, when we ſuck poiſon out of theſe ſweet herbs. Although indeed we cannot from the Scripture get any hurt, but our own corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions procure it to us, becauſe we bring the Scripture to our ends and affections, not them to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To the having of a well-ordered conſcience, <hi>There is greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Pure aims and intentions</note> 
                  <hi>pure aims and intentions.</hi> For although a good intention cannot ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48709:207"/>
an unlawfull action, yet corrupt intentions will blaſt, and defile the beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Inſomuch that if we had the gifts and parts of the ableſt men, yea of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves, yet ſinfull aims would be like Locuſts and Caterpillars to devour this hopefull fruit. But oh the unſearchable hypocriſie and deceitfulneſs of mans heart, even in this very reſpect! How ready is every <hi>Phariſee,</hi> every <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and <hi>Papiſt</hi> to appropriate this to themſelves? How often do we find them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to the whole world, that it is not any outward advantage, any temporal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument that they look at or regard, but the glory of God, and that therefore they have much rejoycing, becauſe of this? But if the counterfeit will bring ſuch peace, what will the real and ſincere intentions of a man do? And certainly though a man be cloathed with never ſo much glory in the Church of God; ſo that we are ready to ſay, not only a greater than <hi>Austin</hi> or <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> but even than <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> (For ſome have cried up the heads of their parties, as having greater gifts, than the Apoſtles themſelves:) Yet without ſincere intentions they are but as <hi>a tinkling cymbal.</hi> This therefore is the life, ſoul, and the all in a good conſcience. But that will come in more ſeaſonably afterwards.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To a right ordered conſcience, whoſe witneſs may be received, and <note place="margin">4. Inward ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> comfort taken thereby, <hi>That there is required the inward ſanctification and effectual renovation thereof.</hi> So that till this be, every mans conſcience is like a man himſelf, a meer liar; There is no believing of it, no truſting of it. When it is ſaid, <hi>Jer. 17. That the heart of a man is deceitfully wicked,</hi> or <hi>crafty,</hi> and ſupplanting a man. This comprehends conſcience, as well as any part elſe. For you have heard, that original ſinne is in this, as well as in other powers of the ſoul. So that in theſe two reſpects, the natural conſcience doth alwayes fail. For either it doth not witneſs that which is right, or not to a right end. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that though a natural man is not to gainſay, or contradict his conſcience, yet nothing lieth upon him more, than to have his conſcience rightly informed or regulated by Gods word. What is the reaſon you ſee every civil man, every formal man ſo applauding himſelf in his good condition? It is becauſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is not a ſpiritual conſcience, a Scripture-conſcience; for that would make him abhor himſelf, and flie out of the <hi>Sodome</hi> he was in. For in moſt things the conſcience doth not witneſs the truth at all, but it doth fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee. How ſeldom doth it tell thee, thou art the drunkard, the hypocrite, the neglecter of private duties, <hi>&amp;c!</hi> Or if it doth, then it is to a falſe end, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to drive to deſpair, and to flie from Chriſt, whoſe blood only can cleanſe the conſcience; or elſe to quiet it again by ſome ſuperſtitious uſages, and <hi>non-</hi>inſtituted remedies. And this is the reaſon, why ſo few are brought out of the troubles of their conſcience into an Evangelical and Goſpel way. Know then, here is the root of all thy miſery, thy conſcience being unſanctified, lulleth thee aſleep, whereby thou rejoyceſt in thy condition, when thou haſt cauſe to fear and tremble.</p>

                  </gap>. But the word is not any where ſo uſed, the inſtances of <hi>Grotius</hi> are againſt him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. For <hi>Conſcience</hi> there is ſaid <hi>to bear witneſſe,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in reſpect of God, and ſo doth relate to his teſtimony. We therefore conclude, That the Spirit of God is here ſaid <hi>to bear witneſſe with our ſpirit;</hi> only the difficulty is, How <note place="margin">How the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with our conſciences.</note> this is done? And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is not done by any external voice and ſound made in the air,</hi> as Chriſt had, when it was ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne.</hi> Neither may we apprehend any <hi>immediate teſtimony</hi> by an extraordinary revelation, as ſome have pleaded for; but in a mediate way, partly by exciting and inabling of our ſpirits to call God <hi>Father,</hi> againſt that ſlaviſhneſs and ſervility, which is apt to bear us down; and partly by working in us thoſe heavenly and holy qualifications, by which we do certainly gather, that we are the children of God. Indeed the <hi>Papists</hi> make the teſtimony of Gods Spirit, to be no more, as applied to particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (though in it ſelf they ſay, it is infallible) then a moral certainty by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conjectures and ſigns. But this is derogatory to the Spirit of God, and taketh away all that Evangelical joy, and holy boldneſs, which we are allowed to have at the throue of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:48709:208"/>
This witneſſing then of Gods Spirit is two wayes: <note place="margin">How it doth. 1. Effectively.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Effectivè,</hi> When it doth enable the conſcience of man to caſt off all legal terrors and tormenting fears, and ſo in ſerenity of ſpirit, to believe God is our Father. And for this end it is called, <hi>The Spirit of Adoption.</hi> For (alas) take the conſcience of the moſt holy man, without this Spirit of Adoption. How legal and timorated is it? How ſlaviſh and unbelieving? Hence is it, that the people of God need ſo many inſtructions and informations. Hence is it, that they are often in prayers and groans unutterable, ere they can truly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially call God <hi>Father.</hi> They fear him as a Judge, and flie from him rather as an enemy. Even as if there be never ſuch glorious and delightfull objects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the eyes with; yet if a man be in the dark, he cannot take any pleaſure therein. Thus many of Gods dear children, who walk with a tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who are diligent in all the wayes of holineſs, yet have not this teſtimony of conſcience to comfort them, it is hid from their eyes, only becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth not enable them thereunto. Now the Apoſtle telleth us, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 17. It is the Spirit of God, whereby we know the things, that we have freely received of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit of God doth witneſs unto us <hi>Objectively,</hi> as I may ſo call it; <note place="margin">2. Objectively.</note> and that is by ſome effects, and fruits of his grace upon our hearts, by which we gather, as by ſo many ſure ſignes, that we are in the ſtate of grace, and not hypocrites. But becauſe this will come in more fully in the enſuing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; <note place="margin">What are the effects of the Spirit by which our conſciences are rightly guided in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing to us. 1. A purpoſe to leave all known ſin.</note> I ſhall only touch upon thoſe effects by which the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is rightly guided in witneſſing to us. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>By having a full and ſerious purpoſe to avoid all ſinne, as it ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come manifeſted to us.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> profeſſed, <hi>That he did hate every evil way, Pſal.</hi> 119. 104. He that doth allow and indulge himſelf in any known ſinne, cannot have the teſtimony of this good conſcience. It is true (as is to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) there is no man living, though never ſo holy, but his conſcience convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him of much ſinne and many infirmities; and this maketh him ſo highly eſteem Chriſt, and a Goſpel-righteouſneſs: but yet it doth not witneſs to him, that he liveth in the cuſtomary acting of groſſe ſinnes; if it doth, the Spirit of God never witneſſeth with ſuch a mans conſcience, that he is the child of God. No, if thou liveſt quietly, without the ſmitings and condemnations of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is becauſe it is ſtupid, and the Devil hath deluded and hardened thee; for Gods Spirit witneſſeth with our conſcience, and by this effect, that we have a tender reſpect to avoid all known ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another effect is, <hi>A zeal for the glory of God, to honour him,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. A zeal for the glory of God.</note> 
                  <hi>to magnifie Chriſt, and to ſet up his Kingdome, as much as we are able.</hi> The more zeal and fervency men have had for Gods honour, the more powerfull te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a good conſcience they alwayes enjoyed. As we ſee in this <hi>Paul,</hi> in his whole miniſterial courſe, with what burning zeal did he flame forth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually? and on the contrary ſo much remiſneſs, ſo much negligence and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, ſo much is the abating of conſciences teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>An holy confidence and boldneſſe in our approachings to God.</hi> And <note place="margin">3. An holy confidence in our approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings unto God</note> of this the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom. 8. The Spirit of Adoption,</hi> removing our fears, our unbelief, and dejection, raiſing us up alſo with an holy confidence and humble boldneſs, doth hereby teſtifie with our conſciences, that we are the children of God. Hence the more diſtruſtfull fears, the more tormenting doubts that we groan under, the weaker and more feeble is the witneſs of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yea if thoſe prevail and are predominant, then our conſcience is ſet againſt us, and witneſſeth againſt us; and then the child of God is in ſad deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when his heart witneſſeth againſt him, that he is an hypocrite, that he did ſerve the Lord without integrity. For though this be falſe, yet till Gods Spirit remove this darkneſſe, and fill thee with an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48709:208"/>
confidence, thou art not able to hold up thy head.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another effect, by which Gods Spirit witneſſeth with our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">4. Love to the Brethren.</note> is, <hi>An unfeigned love to the brethren, a delight in all thoſe that love God.</hi> Where this is, that thou loveſt godly men for their godlineſs ſake, this demonſtrateth thou art born of God, and haſt the ſame Image in thee, as they have. And if thy love alſo extend to thy enemies, if thou findeſt that thou canſt pray for them that curſe thee, do good to them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, eſpecially thou pitieſt their ſouls, and wouldſt be helpfull to them in the way to Heaven; though they are enraged adverſaries to thee, and that without cauſe: By this frame of heart, the conſcience doth give a full and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious evidence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>In daily and faithfull exerciſes of ſelf-denial in the wayes of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Self-denial.</note> 
                  <hi>doth the Spirit of God greatly aſſure the conſcience.</hi> In ſufferings for Chriſt, in enduring the loſſe of name, liberty, and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it ſelf for Gods cauſe, is the cleareſt teſtimony of our conſcience. Hence the Martyrs had ſo much ſerenity of ſpirit, ſuch unſpeakable conſolations, becauſe they found they loved Chriſt, better than all things. As they gave a teſtimony to the word of God, called therefore <hi>Martyrs;</hi> ſo God alſo gave them a teſtimony within, whereby they did glory in tribulations, and triumph over all aduerſaries. We ſee that if men ſuffer in falſe wayes, if they be Martyrs for the Devil, if they die for that which is highly offending God, they many times glory in the comfort they have from the teſtimony of their conſcience. Now if a deluded conſcience, if deluded joyes can do ſo much, what ſhall not the Spirit of God do, ſealing and confirming his love to us, by our patient ſufferings for him? Thus when happily the world doth witneſs againſt thee, wicked men they condemn thee, and lay many heavy accuſations againſt thee, as the falſe Apoſtles did here concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> yet this teſtimony with in will anſwer all, and God doth come in with fuller evidences of his love in ſuch paſſages of ſelf denial.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Spirit of God doth witneſs to our ſpirit, in this bleſſed effect, <note place="margin">6. Delight in heavenly things.</note> viz. <hi>When we do with delight and joy meditate, think and ſpeak about heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, when the Ordinances of God are matter of pleaſure to us. David</hi> doth often pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efs what delight he had in the Ordinances of God, how the word of God was <hi>more precious than gold, more ſweet than the honey-comb.</hi> Now when the heart is thus affected to holy things, that they find more joy, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. in the things of God, then worldly men do in their corn and wine, when theſe increaſe: By this excellent heavenly temper, the Spirit of God witneſſeth with our conſcience, that we are the children of God.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall enlarge no more on this, becauſe the Doctrine of Aſſurance will follow upon the next words.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now lay down ſome diſtinctions, to clear this truth to you, becauſe <note place="margin">Diſtinctions concerning the teſtimony of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> it is plain, That many times the people of God being caſt down with black thoughts, that cannot ſay with <hi>Paul, The teſtimony of our conſcience is our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</hi> And on the other ſide, many heretical, phariſaical and ſelf-deluded perſons, will at leaſt outwardly boaſt of this. Therefore</p>
               <p>Firſt, We may take notice, That there is a two-fold teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <note place="margin">1. 'Tis either particular or general.</note> which doth afford matter of rejoycing; either <hi>particular,</hi> as to ſome matter of fact, or one particular buſineſs, eſpecially when calummated by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Or ſecondly, <hi>General,</hi> which is to the whole frame of our heart, and our whole converſation. Theſe two are greatly to be diſtinguiſhed. For we ſee <hi>David</hi> in many places praying to God, <hi>That he would reward him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his innocency, and deal with him according to the righteouſneſſe of his hands:</hi> and he doth many times appeal to God concerning his integrity. Now this was from a teſtimony of his conſcience to a particular fact. <hi>Saul,</hi> and others did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly accuſe him, laying to his charge things that he never did. Of this <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:48709:209"/>
ſpeaketh alſo, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 2. I know nothing by my ſelf.</hi> He did not matter thoſe crimes that the falſe Apoſtles burdened him with, becauſe his conſcience did clear him, as to any groſſe neglect in his miniſterial courſe. Now you muſt know, that many a natural or moral man, may have in ſome caſes this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar teſtimony of his conſcience, and receive comfort from it, and yet be farre enough from the ſtate of grace. How many perſons in the world are ſlandered by ſome malicious adverſaries, as guilty of ſuch crimes, which are altogether falſe? Now happily thou art pure and free from them, thy conſcience juſtifieth thee, and thou haſt comfort from this; but this is not all which God requireth. Therefore there is a ſecond teſtimony of the conſcience, which is <hi>General,</hi> and that ſpeaketh to the whole man, witneſſing that thy whole converſation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and that thy heart in the univerſal inclination thereof, is wholly for God, and againſt ſinne. It is this general teſtimony that is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of true comfort. A man may be free and innocent, as to ſome particular ſinnes, and yet the ſtate of his ſoule be in gall and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This teſtimony of the conſcience even in general, witneſſing unto</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It witneſſeth either perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> 
                  <hi>thee thy ſtate of grace, may be conſidered two wayes.</hi> For either it may be <hi>ſuppoſed or expected, that it ſhould teſtifie unto thee an heart and life free from all ſinne, failing in nothing at all.</hi> Or elſe, <hi>To witneſſe ſincerity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the main, though failing in many things.</hi> If then a Chriſtian ſhould reſolve to take no joy, unleſſe his conſcience can witneſs perfection, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from any failings, ſuch an one muſt reſolve to have no comfort all his life time; but if it witneſs the main bent and frame of thy heart to be for God, though carried aſide often through the violence and deceitfulneſſe of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from this thou mayeſt rejoyce. This is much to be obſerved; for why are the diſcouragements and diſconſolateneſs of Gods own children ſo great, but becauſe their conſcience telleth them of ſeveral failings, and they deſire ſome teſtimony of a perfection? Satisfie your ſelves therefore, and regulate your thoughts in this particular. And thus we muſt expound that place, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20, 21. which at firſt appearance ſeemeth to ſpeak very terribly, <hi>If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</hi> This Text if not rightly underſtood, is enough like <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> writing in the wall, to ſtrike us with trembling. For is there any man living, whoſe heart doth not condemn him for ſinne? Doth not this very Apoſtle ſay, 1 <hi>John 1. 8. If we ſay we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelves, and no truth is in us?</hi> If then we have ſinne, how can our hearts but condemn us? And then God knowing our hearts, and ſeeing more evil and errour in us, then we can underſtand, muſt condemn us much more. What is this then, but to fill every godly man with deſpair? But that the Apoſtle himſelf may not ſpeak a contradiction, we muſt have recourſe to the mentioned diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> That our hearts condemn us <hi>juſtly,</hi> for the main, that our foundation is rotten, that we love ſinne more than God, then we have cauſe to be wholly caſt down; but if our hearts do not condemn us for the main, only for thoſe imperfections and frailties, which we cannot perfectly be purged from in this life, then we may have confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Our conſcience may be conſidered as Habitually able to teſtifie, or as Actually and immediately prepared.</hi> This is neceſſary to be obſerved; For <note place="margin">3. Conſcience is either habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepared to teſtifie.</note> every regenerate man having his conſcience ſanctified, is thereby habitually able to give a good teſtimony, but many things may intervene that hinder it in its actings. Even as the Sunne is able to give a clear light to the whole world; but clouds and miſts may hinder the actual communication of it. And thus it is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the children of God; their conſcience is ſanctified, but many doubts ariſe, many ſcruples and fears do interpoſe, ſo that they have not that actual
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48709:209"/>
witneſs in their conſcience which they might have. So that as in ſanctification there are the principles of grace, though the exerciſe of them may be ſtopt: So it is in matter of conſolation, there is the foundation and fountain of it, though the ſtream may be troubled. And this ſhould make us wary ſo to walk, as not to put ſtops and checks in the way of conſcience, eſpecially to labour for a ſound judgement, and a full perſwaſion in things to be done. For the more doubtfull and ſcrupulous we are, the leſs firm and clear is the teſtimony of our conſcience, as appeareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>We are to distinguiſh of the teſtimony of conſcience, as alone and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone or relating to Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeparate, or relating wholly to the blood of Chriſt, in whom alone all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and cauſe of comfort is contained.</hi> Whereas if a man ſhould attend to the teſtimony of conſcience <hi>alone,</hi> though to his beſt actions, he would have more cauſe to fear and tremble from that, then rejoyce. Therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture attributeth the purging of our conſcience to the blood of Chriſt, there is no mans conſcience can be good and truly peaceable, that doth not look to Chriſt, that ſaith not with <hi>John, Behold the lamb of God that taketh away thy ſinne,</hi> as well as behold the holy duties thou haſt lived in. <hi>Heb. 9. 14. How much rather ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge your conſcience from dead workes?</hi> Let conſcience then alwayes eye Chriſt; look to him as well as to our graces. For the goodneſs of an evangelical conſcience lieth not in this, to teſtifie thou haſt not been ſuch a ſinner, or thou haſt not ſuch failings; but though thou haſt been ſuch, yet repenting and believing through the blood of Chriſt, thy conſcience is not to condemn thee for them, becauſe pardoned. Now the conſcience of a civil and phariſaical man, which comforts from works done, doth not at all relate to Chriſt; and by this thou mayeſt find the deceitfulneſs of it, ſeeing that by Chriſts blood alone it cometh to be truly purified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe 1. Of Inſtruction.</hi> How few they are that have this right teſtimony of conſcience within them, they have ſeared ſtupid conſciences, or they have delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ones, that make them truſt in other things, then Chriſts blood. Do not moſt men reſt in this, that their conſcience telleth them they are baptized, they are made partakers of the Ordinances of God, and this is all the witneſs they have? But the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> layeth an Axe to the root of this, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. Baptiſme ſaveth,</hi> but then by a rhetorical correction addeth, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the body, but an anſwer of a good conſcience.</hi> It is generally thought to be an alluſion to a Covenant or contract (for ſo Baptiſm is) wherein the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is asked, <hi>Do you take God for your God? Renounce the Devil, and all the luſts of the fleſh?</hi> Now if a man can unſeignedly, and with a good conſcience anſwer that, he keepeth to baptiſmal ingagements, this will ſave.</p>

               <p>Before we come to the particulars, and open the Greek words, we muſt take notice of the certainty and ſure knowledge <hi>Paul</hi> had of his ſincerity. For how could <hi>Paul</hi> glory and rejoyce in his <hi>ſincerity,</hi> if he did not know it, yea ſo know it, that his conſcience with the Spirit of God did witneſs it to him? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is one of thoſe places, that is brought in the controverſie between Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and us, about the certainty of our being in the ſtate of grace, which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> indeed would enervate. But his labour is in vain. For what can be clearer, then that <hi>Paul</hi> had a certain knowledge of his upright heart, ſeeing he did make this publick teſtimony of it, and take ſo much joy therein? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Paul</hi> in this pretend to any extraordinary revelation, as if he had ſome peculiar priviledge in this above others, as when he was rapt up into the third Heavens; but he avoucheth the teſtimony of his conſcience, which muſt be in an ordinary way. From this we obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Believer may have a certain knowledge, not only that he performeth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A believer may be aſſured he performeth duties with an upright heart.</note> 
                  <hi>thoſe gracious duties God requireth, but that he doth them with an upright and ſincere heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> did not only know, that he was diligent in preaching of the Goſpel, that he was faithfull in diſpenſing of the word of God, but alſo that all this was done with faithfull and ſincere reſpects. We do not only know that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that we repent, but that we do theſe things in the uprightneſſe of our ſouls. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> urgeth this much, <hi>Though we do diſcharge the duties God requireth, yet how can we know, that we do them with an whole heart, with a ſincere ſpirit? Many hypocrites</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are ſure. Yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>among
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48709:210"/>
the Proteſtants, one is aſſured of his way, and another of another Sect, but we are aſſured that they are all deluded.</hi> So that he concludeth, <hi>Seeing all the Hereticks of this age boaſt of this certainty, yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>even in their opinion many are deceived, and in ours all are.</hi> But we are to walk by the Scripture-light in this caſe. And indeed this being a truth, the knowledge whereof is obtained both by Scripture and experience, the ſavoury work of grace, and ſenſe of Chriſts Spirit dwelling in us, doth more to perſwade of this truth, then voluminous controverſies. This Queſtion is beſt anſwered by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent prayer, and an heavenly life; and therefore practical experimental Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians can ſpeak more to this point, then the moſt learned ſpeculative Doctors, unleſs they have a gracious broken heart, as well as a learned profound head. That a believer may be aſſured of the truth of grace, appeareth by ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and general aſſertions of Scriptures. Examples, as <hi>Hezekiah, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> 2 King. 20. 3. In <hi>Job,</hi> who though under ſad temptations both from God and his dear friends, who charged upon him hypocriſie, yet he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let go the perſwaſion of his integrity. <hi>David,</hi> how often doth he profeſſe his love of God with all his heart? <hi>Peter,</hi> when Chriſt asked him again and again, he anſwered, <hi>Thou knoweſt Lord I love thee,</hi> John 21. 17. As for thoſe places, which affirm this truth, I ſhall name one or two, <hi>John 14. 17. Ye know the Spirit, for he dwels with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 20. At that day ye ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> What is clearer then? As where the Sunne is there is light to ſee it: ſo where the Spirit of God dwelleth and worketh in a man, there is an evident diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it. 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 11, 12. What man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man within; even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God, that we might know the things freely given to us of God.</hi> By this we ſee, that as the ſoul by its rational powers doth diſcover and feel the workings of reaſon and underſtanding within it ſelf; ſo alſo by thoſe ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles of grace infuſed into it, it is able to diſcern and feel the divine and heavenly motions of a ſupernatural life within him. The firſt Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> doth in many places ſpeak of this knowledge, whereby we perceive that God is in us, and we in him. But I intend not to enlarge on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>Let us explain this truth, and conſider, What is required to cauſe this <note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledg of our being in a ſtate of grace. 1. A firm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the truth of Gods promiſes and Word.</note> certain knowledge in us, that we are ſincere and in a ſtate of grace, and ſo by conſequent, that we are juſtified, elected, and ſhall aſſuredly be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is required, <hi>A firm aſſent and faith of the truth of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which are in the general revealed in the Word;</hi> as ſuch as theſe, <hi>He that believeth, hath paſſed from death to life. By faith we have remiſſion of ſinnes through the blood of Chriſt. Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdome of Heaven.</hi> The promiſes alſo to ſuch as do confeſſe and forſake their ſinnes, we are ſtrongly to aſſure our ſouls of. Yea, not only the promiſes, but the whole truths revealed in Gods word, we are firmly to aſſent to by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous faith. For the lively actings of faith to its general objects, do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conduce to the application of it to particular and ſpecial objects. As men of quick animal actions, are thereby more enabled to rational; for ſeeing what is in the underſtanding was firſt in the ſenſe; the more expedite they are, the more vigorous is the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is required, <hi>A particular application of Chriſt and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to our ſelves by faith.</hi> For herein lieth the efficacy of faith, when with <note place="margin">2. A particular application of the promiſes to themſelves.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> it ſaith, <hi>My Lord, my God:</hi> Or with <hi>Paul, Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> For as the ſeeing of meat, though never ſo excellent
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:48709:211"/>
and wholſome doth not nouriſh, but the eating of it: So the beholding of Chriſt revealed in the Word, as a Saviour in the general, doth not juſtifie and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but the applying of him to be my Chriſt and my Saviour. For this reaſon <hi>faith</hi> is called, <hi>Iohn 6. The eating of Chriſts fleſh, and drinking of Chriſts blood.</hi> And the Sacrament of the Lords Supper doth require this particular applying act of faith; and this is the foundation for our future knowledge; till Chriſt be ours, we cannot know he is ours; till Chriſt be received by faith to dwell in our hearts, we cannot perceive that he doth dwell there. Happily then the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth us, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. To adds to faith virtue;</hi> By that is meant the efficacy and livelineſs of faith in receiving of Chriſt. And then to this we muſt adde <hi>knowledge: Knowledge</hi> is to follow this efficacious application of Chriſt. Now this is the greater work of our faith, as to our juſtification. This is that which the Papiſts do ſo declaim againſt, and for which <hi>Eſtius</hi> calleth us <hi>Specia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtas,</hi> Specialiſts. But certainly this is the acting of faith that maketh us rich, that bringeth Chriſt the treaſure into our ſoul, and it is this, which the Devil doth ſo oppoſe in all the godly. Hence are all thoſe fiery darts of <hi>Satan,</hi> all thoſe ſad and black aggravations of ſinne, whereby the ſoul, like that woman with the bloody flux, is afraid and trembleth to come directly to Chriſt. It is that applying act of faith, that the Devil ſo diligently would keep thee off, whereas if thou didſt but taſte of this honey, as <hi>Ionathan;</hi> or rather plentifully fill thy ſelf with it, thou wouldſt with much ſpiritual fortitude purſue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all thy ſpiritual enemies. This was the bleſſed truth that our Reformers reſcued out of Popery, being enabled thereunto by the word of God as a Rule, and the experimental work of grace upon their ſouls, as a ſure witneſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them therein. But this is not all. Therefore to obtain this knowledge, there is required an <hi>Internal ſenſe and feeling</hi> of the fit frame of our heart, whereby we perceive that we are ſuch who do believe, and do love God, who do repent of our ſinnes upon firme and pure grounds. For unleſſe there be this inward diſcerning of what is in us, how is it poſſible to arrive at any certainty? Now it is this that the Popiſh adverſaries do moſt batter, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be the weakeſt part in the Wall. It is true (ſay they) we believe the Scripture that ſpeaketh generally, <hi>Whoſoever believeth and repenteth, ſhall have his ſins pardoned:</hi> But when you come to the Aſſumption: But <hi>I believe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> here you are ſubject to many miſtakes, here you may be deceived. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all hypocrites are deluded in this reſpect; They make falſe applications to themſelves; through ſelf-love they deceive themſelves, thinking they have good hearts, when they have them not. But this doth not inferre, that the truly godly are therefore deceived; no more then becauſe an Heretick hath great confidence that he is in the truth, yet is deceived, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that therefore the orthodox man is alſo in an errour. Becauſe men in a dream are deluded, doth it follow that men cannot tell, when they be indeed awake? We muſt know then, That as we have a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the bodily ſenſes, we are certain we hear, we ſee: So the ſoul in her immaterial operations, hath a ſenſe and feeling of them; We feel, we know, we underſtand, we love, we delight. Theſe internal motions of the ſoule are perceived, as well as the things of ſenſe; and to ſay, we may be decived here, and no truth can be diſcovered, is to turn all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge into <hi>Scepticiſme,</hi> and to hold <hi>Nihil ſcitur;</hi> yea that that alſo is not knowne, <hi>That nothing is knowne.</hi> And beſides, it is directly againſt Scripture, <hi>No man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>This then being laid as a foundation, That a mans own ſpirit doth feel and percieve what are the motions thereof, it followeth, That when a man doth uprightly and ſincerely love God, and walk in his way, he doth experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:48709:211"/>
diſcern this he knoweth, he believeth, he knoweth he loveth God. But <note place="margin">What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental diſcerning of our graces. 1. An humble heart.</note> that this may be done, there is required,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>An humble broken heart, and poverty of ſpirit, whereby we are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied of all our own righteouſneſſe, renouncing every thing that is ours, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirsting after Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe.</hi> Every gracious heart that cometh to the knowledge of its ſincerity, hath this concomitant diſpoſition, there is an humble, lowly, broken ſpirit, it feeleth it ſelf undone and loſt. It feareth all that it hath done, and therefore can reſt no where, but on Chriſt onely. Now although many do deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, many doe flatter and delude their owne ſoules, yet where there is this frame of heart, there will never be any miſcarriage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Beſides this brokenneſs of heart, there is required, <hi>A regular</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. A regular diſpoſition in the ſoul.</note> 
                  <hi>and undiſtempered dispoſition in the ſoul.</hi> For though the ſenſe cannot be deceived about its proper object; hence is that ſaying, <hi>Non eſt dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum de guſtu, We muſt not dispute about taſte;</hi> yet if the palate be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, nothing is more ordinary, than to judge that bitter which is ſweet. And this falleth out ſometimes to the choiſeſt people of God; there are troubleſome and diſquieting temptations upon them, they are in blackneſs and ſadneſs. Now in ſuch a caſe, we are no more able to know what we are, than we can ſee our faces in troubled waters. So that this due and prepared qualification of the ſoul, muſt be alwayes preſent in the judging of our ſelves; As in all faculties, whether the intellective or viſive, if they have any impediment in their operation, they cannot produce their convenient operations. The underſtanding in a mad man, and in a man faſt aſleep, is wholly hindered in its workings: So may the ſenſes be either by ſome hurt upon the ſenſitive powers, or by the indiſpoſition of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> or through the diſtance of the object. Thus it is in the ſoul when ſanctified; there may be many diſtempers, ſeveral impediments, which may hinder it from paſſing a true judgement about its ſtate; and therefore the adviſe of <hi>Caſuists</hi> in ſuch caſes is, not to ſeeke for this aſſurance and evidence, but to put forth acts of faith by meere dependance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbance on the promiſes of the Goſpel. Even as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did: For <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him, Job</hi> 13. 15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This frame of heart whereby we are enabled to know our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">3. An holy fear.</note> is alwayes accompanied with a <hi>godly filial and holy fear.</hi> That fear which is ſo often commanded in Scripture, and with which we are to worke out our ſalvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. It is true, there is a ſlaviſh, and ſervile feare, tormenting us with daily doubts, and this is properly expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this knowledge of our ſincerity, and there is no greater enemy to an Evangelical and Goſpel life, which is in faith, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, then theſe tormenting doubts about our ſelves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Papiſts who teach and encourage theſe doubtings, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of humility, do thereby drive us from Chriſt. Yea <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>If there were no other cauſe, then this, we had ground enough to depart from the Church of Rome.</hi> But though this <hi>Iſhmael</hi> muſt be caſt out, yet not <hi>Iſaac</hi> too. There is a lawfull fear, whereby as children we reverence God, are afraid of any frowne from him, and doe thereby diligently attend to all thoſe duties he hath commanded; and this is neceſſary to beget a true knowledge of our upright hearts, and by this that raſh preſumption of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures,</hi> of impenitent and ſecure ſinnes, is wholly excluded; for they doe in a preſumptuous manner indulge themſelves in all ſinnes, having no holy fear in the godly uſe of all thoſe means God hath commanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:48709:212"/>
Fourthly, To enable the ſoul of a believer thus to know and be aſſured <note place="margin">4. The help of Gods Spirit.</note> of its ſincerity, there is above all required, <hi>The helpe of Gods Spirit.</hi> For the Texts above-mentioned doe attribute it to the Spirit of God dwelling in us, whereby we come to know what God hath wrought in us. It's the <hi>Spirit of God which helpeth our infirmities</hi> in prayer, and doth ſeale and witneſſe unto us, that we are the children of God. Therefore though a godly mans ſoul be as fully beſpangled with graces, as the firmament with ſtarres; yet if the Spirit of God enable not to diſcerne of theſe, we are in daily fluctuations of ſpirit. As <hi>Hagar</hi> had a fountain of water by her, but ſhe was ready to periſh with thirſt, till God opened her eyes to ſee it. And as the Prophets man could not behold that great company which was on his ſide, till his eyes were inabled thereunto; ſo neither do we know what are the gracious workings of Gods Spirit in us, without this ſealing witneſſe of Gods Spirit. But of this more largely, when we come to the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe in this Chapter. Now when all theſe are concurrent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Doth the godly ſoul with a certaine knowledge conclude, that it is in a ſtate of grace, and ſo juſtified with God. Whether this be a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of faith, or of ſenſe, or mixed of both, is diſputed. But it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be the later. For as faith in the aſſenting act is carried out to principles clearly revealed in the Word. And then ſecondarily to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by good and ſure conſequence deduced from them: So is faith in the fiducial actings of it to the promiſes, as laid downe in the general; and then to the ſame, as particularly applied; So that faith and experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to make up this certaine knowledge, a glorious and rare priviledge. For becauſe men doe live ſo diſſolutely and careleſly, becauſe they doe ſo little exerciſe themſelves in holineſſe and cloſe walking with God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thinke ſuch a thing is impoſſible. Yea, becauſe the people of God are ſo ſenſible of their infirmities, and conſtant weakneſſes, they think it is no duty, but ſinfull preſumption, to believe any ſuch thing concerning themſelves. But in the next place we are to ſhew you, that it it is a duty which we ought to preſſe after.</p>

Therefore of all the Queſtions in Divinity, thou art to ſtudy to exerciſe thy ſelf moſt in this, <hi>Whether doeſt thou know, that thou art in a ſtate of grace, that thou art no hypocrite, no ſelf-deluded wretch in the wayes of Religion, but that thou haſt ſincerity and truth in the inward parts?</hi> How much more advantagious would it be to Chriſtians, if they ſtudied the reſolution of this caſe more? It is ſtrange that many can ſpend their time in diſputes about either unneceſſary things, or too ſublime for their capacities, or ſuch Queſtions, that they are not concerned in. And as for this, which is the main fundamental one, as to their particulars, be wholly negligent about it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a good reſolution herein, is of ſo great importance, that we may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that we do not lay all other ſtudies aſide; yea bid all other buſineſſes ſtand alooff off, till the Spirit of God upon ſure grounds, hath perſwaded us herein. If your temporal eſtate were queſtioned; if all your livelihood were called into queſtion, and it began to be doubtfull, whether the eſtate you enjoy were your own by the right of the Laws, or no; eſpecially if others did ſollicite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take it from you: Would not this make you runne and ride night and day, till you had obtained ſuch firm evidences, that all your adverſaries could not invalidate? How then cometh it about, that we will thus deſperately put the ſtate of our ſouls to a venture, if I be regenerated, I am regenerated; if but a temporary believer, I am no more, I will put it to the event, let it fall out how it will? Oh the ſad blindneſſe and heavy judgements of men in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and yet thou that liveſt thus doubtfully, and wilt die thus doubtfully. How uncertain is thy life? What a bubble and vapour art thou? Oh remember that the time is coming, that a godly ability to anſwer thy ſelf in this doubt and temptation, will be more worth, then all the world, when thou art to be ſnatched from this world, to enjoy the comforts thereof no more, when thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeſt thy ſelf ſummoned by death to ſtand at Gods Tribunal; where grace, and only grace through the blood of Chriſt, will be a ſure plea. What agonies,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:48709:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what perplexities, what confuſions will be upon thy ſoul? If thou crieſt out then, Oh I know not what I am, what will become of me, whether I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Live I muſt not, die I dare not! Oh that I could hear a voice from Heaven immediately witneſſing unto me, that my ſpiritual eſtate is ſafe and good! Be ſure that of all the Queſtions in the world, you will one day be put moſt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this, Not ſo much what knowledge you had, what gifts and enlargements you had, what not, what remarkable external duties you have done for God; but with what ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of heart, all this hath been performed? Therefore meditate on this leſſon, as it were, every day be ſtudying of it, to know all the practical myſteries about it. And as the Husbandman before he can ſow his ground with corn muſt cut up the roots and buſhes, which are in the <note place="margin">What are the hinderances which keep men from looking after an aſſurance of their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 1. Self-fulneſs and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſecurity</note> way; ſo do thou. That thou mayeſt the better ſet thy ſelf upon this duty of preſſing after ſure knowledge in this great matter, remove firſt, All thoſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments and hinderances that keep thee from exerciſing thy ſelf therein, and they are theſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A ſelf-fulneſſe, and preſumptuous ſecurity that thou art already in a good eſtate.</hi> This is the condemnation and eternal ruine of many a mans ſoul, he will not ſo much as put it to the Queſtion, Whether he be in a ſtate of grace and ſalvation, or no; he will not ſo much as entertain one doubt about it? No, this is the way to bring him in deſpair; by this means he may have trouble and diſquietneſs of conſcience; he cannot live ſo jollily and ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he doth: Therefore whatſoever Gods word, or the Miniſtry ſpeaketh, though never ſo terribly about the deceitfulneſs of mans heart, that we delude our ſelves, taking that which is like grace for true grace, they matter it not; they will perſwade themſelves that their ſouls are in a good eſtate, and none in the world ſhall make them queſtion it. Of all the men in the world, ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure confident ſpirits have the moſt cauſe to doubt and fear. Never to doubt, or ſearch into thy heart, and to compare thy ſelf with the Rule, is a very ill ſigne. To take all for granted thus concerning thy ſoul, and never to commune with thy own heart, is a great argument that thou art rotten in the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Doth not the Wiſeman obſerve it, as a general Rule, <hi>Prov. 16. 2. The wayes of a man are clean in his own eyes, but the Lord pondereth the heart?</hi> Though thou ſayeſt with the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Thou art rich cloathed, and wanteſt nothing, yet God knoweth thou art poor, curſed and miſerable.</hi> God knoweth otherwiſe by thee, then thou doeſt. We charge it upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe is incurable, becauſe of this principle ſhe holdeth, <hi>That ſhe cannot erre.</hi> For if ſhe would yeeld that, if ſhe would grant happily for ſo many years they have been groſly deceived, then there would be ſome principles to proceed upon to reform them. So it is, if we meet with a man that confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his heart is deceitfull, his condition may be very miſerable, though he hath applauded himſelf thus many years; if I may be found out not to have laid a good foundation about the work of grace, I would gladly be convinced of it; It is the great deſire of my ſoul, not to be deceived about the nature of grace in me. There are fearfull and ſad inſtances of hypocrites and temporary believers, therefore I would gladly be informed, Whether I came not too ſhort as yet? Whether there be not a more excellent way then I have attained unto? This man is not farre from the Kingdom of Heaven; this man is in a way to be ſecured; But the ſelf-righteous man, that ſuppoſeth himſelf good, it is the firſt principle with him, that he will never ſuffer to be queſtioned; this man is remedileſs as to humane appearance, Such a preſumptuous man in practicals, is like an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick in doctrinals; and ſo after the firſt and ſecond admonition, we may even reject, knowing that he doth willingly damne himſelfe. Be ſure then to take heed of this rock, at which ſo many have ſplit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

A ſecond cauſe that muſt be removed, is, <hi>A prophane careleſſe ſpirit;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men do not at all matter their ſouls, nor in what relation they do ſtand in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">2. A prophane careleſs ſpirit.</note> God. If their bodies be well, if their worldly affairs proſper, then they ſay, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe.</hi> But as for their ſpiritual condition, whether God be reconciled, or an enemy, whether yet they have been ever taken off that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and curſed eſtate they were born in, they never look after it. Oh fooliſh and brutiſh man! If the Spirit of God ſhall once convince thee of thy ſinfull and dangerous eſtate, of the curſes of the Law which may fall upon thee every moment, then thou maiſt have no reſt day or night, till thou obtaineſt ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance herein.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe is, <hi>The over-greedineſſe and importunate minding of our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Carking carefulneſs.</note> 
                  <hi>buſineſſes.</hi> We riſe with the world in our heart, and go to bed with it in our heart, ſo that we never ſet time apart ſeriouſly to think, how it is with us. Hence come thoſe conſtant delayes and procraſtinations, promiſing our ſelves we will after ſuch and ſuch buſineſſes are over, ſet our ſelves to the examination of our wayes; but ſtill the work is not done, our dayes paſſe away, our hearts grow more hardned and indiſpoſed every day, till at laſt death unexpectedly ſeizeth upon us, and then we would gladly have oil, when it is too late, then with <hi>Eſai</hi> we cry out for a bleſſing with tears and bitterneſs, but we come too late. How comfortable on the other ſide is it for a godly man dying, to ſay his ſoul hath been ſet in order long before, he hath not his evidences now to ſeeke? The knowing of his heart, hath beene all his ſtudy in his life time, <hi>Satan</hi> can object no new thing, which he hath not already thought upon.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There is another cauſe in the other extream, which is to be removed, <note place="margin">4. Deſpairing and diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thoughts.</note> if we would arrive to this certainty, and that is, <hi>To ſhake off all despairing and diſcouraging thoughts, as ſo many vipers faſtened upon thee.</hi> This valley muſt be exalted, as well as the other mountains levelled. Paper too much wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as well as foul, receiveth no characters: So the heart ſinfully dejected and diſquieted, is indiſpoſed for aſſurance, as well as the preſumptuous one. For this reaſon we need the Spirit of God to ſeal us, and to confirm us: yea we need Gods Spirit more in this work of confirmation, then of illumination. Darkneſs and ignorance is ſooner removed out of the mind, than unbelief and diffidence out of the heart. Do ye not ſee it thus often with the children of God, who are very tender in reſpect of illumination, are very quick and Eagle-eyed in reſpect of conviction, are wonderfully ingenuous to find out all the ſecret pollution and guile of their ſouls. But then for aſſurance and confirmation in the grace and favour of God towards them, they are exceedingly fearfull, and very weak. Therefore the believer muſt look upon ſlaviſh and diſquieting fears, as adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to his peace, as well as preſumptuous and ſecure thoughts.</p>
               <p>Theſe impediments being thus rolled out of the way, the next thing he hath <note place="margin">Of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to get aſſurance.</note> to do, is to <hi>awe his foul with thoſe Commands of God, that require us to get a certain knowledge of our eſtate.</hi> For we ſee by the Popiſh objections, yea and of many others againſt this way, as if it did nouriſh ſecurity, as if it were the great wiſdome of God to keep every man in this life uncertain about his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſtate, that ſo he may be kept in humility and fear: (I ſay) by ſuch plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objections as theſe are, a man hath made a good progreſs, that can deſpiſe them all, that is convinced it is his duty to preſs after this certain knowledge; and alſo that God hath promiſed to give his Spirit to work this in us. And that therefore if we complain of our fears and uncertain doubts we are to blame our ſelves, who like the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> do peeviſhly keep our ſelves in this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, if we conſider thoſe places, which ſpeak ſo univerſally, that God hath given his Spirit to all thoſe that are his ſons, whereby they are inabled to call him <hi>Father.</hi> Is it not diſputed, Whether all that are truly godly have not
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:48709:214"/>
this certain knowledge, eſpecially conſidering, how the firſt Reformers went ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high this way. Hence is that expreſſion of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which may ſtartle the Reader, <hi>Lib. 3. Inſtitut. cap. 2. Sect 16. Verè fidelis non eſt, niſi qui ſolidâ perſuaſione,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He is not truly a believer, who being not perſwaded by a ſolid perſwaſion, that God is a propitious and mercifull Father to him, from whoſe benignity he promiſeth himſelf all things, who doth not upon the confidence of the promiſes of Gods good will to him, aſſuredly conclude of his ſalvation,</hi> which he repeateth again. But this will be better conſidered at <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>For the commands to this duty, I ſhall only commend two places unto you, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Examine your ſelves, whether ye be in the faith, prove your ſelves, know ye not that Chriſt is in you, except ye be</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>men of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound mind,</hi> that have no ſpiritual skill and experience to know, what is of God in you, and what of the Devil; what is of the Spirit, and what of the fleſh and nature in you. Here you ſee this duty is commanded, and that earneſtly with ingemination; and the Greek words do ſignifie, that the truth of grace, and the life of Chriſt in us, is not eaſily found out: We muſt take pains, and exactly diſtinguiſh; the bottom may be copper, when the ſuperficies be gold. There are many reſemblances of grace, which are not grace. That expreſſion of <hi>Calvins</hi> is true, though ſo much abuſed by Papiſts, <hi>Reprobi ſimili ferè modo afficiuntur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(Calvin. Inſtitut. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">do</hi>. <hi>Sect. 11.) That even ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are affected almoſt with the ſame experimental ſenſe and feeling as the elect are, and therefore they muſt have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil.</hi> As the <hi>Gemmary</hi> by his skill can find the difference between true metal and counterfeit.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Text is, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 10. Wherefore the rather Brethren, give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure. Give all diligence]</hi> This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, That the Chriſtian who liveth careleſly and negligently, who is not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in ſpirit, and vigorous in the actings of holineſs, is ſubject to many doubts and uncertain diſputations about his eſtate. Now it would be a vain exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to bid us, <hi>Uſe all diligence</hi> for the attaining of that which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew it is our duty, and truly we may be the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged in the purſuance of this, if we do conſider the bleſſed and happy effects of <note place="margin">The effects of our ſouls.</note> ſuch a certain knowledge of our ſelves.

               <p>HAving finiſhed the general, we now come to the particular, wherein his <hi>conſcience</hi> did give this <hi>good teſtimony;</hi> and that is concerning his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world.

                  </gap>. The Vulgar Latine addeth <hi>heart, In ſingleneſſe of heart,</hi> for ſo we find it uſed in other places, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 5. Coloſ.</hi> 3. 22. But that is ſuppoſed in the word, though it be not expreſſed. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſpeaketh of a Manuſcript that readeth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now when he ſaith, <hi>In ſimplicity,</hi> by that he meaneth, he did nothing craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, crookedly, hypocritically, deceitfully, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> interpreteth it in many ſynonymous words. <hi>Varinus</hi> maketh the contrary to <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> almoſt the ſame words <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath. The word is often uſed for <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>liberality,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11, 13. becauſe thoſe who have a ſingle plain ſpirit, are hearty, ready and free in all duties that are required.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe that doth properly reſpect the aims and intentions of men in all their wayes; although we are not to be too exact in making a diſtinction between them. This <hi>ſimplicity</hi> is as much as <hi>ſine plicis,</hi> that which is <hi>ſmooth and plain,</hi> that hath not many folds and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, and ſo is oppoſite to that which is in the Old Teſtament called <hi>an heart, and an heart,</hi> a man that hath <hi>two hearts.</hi> So that this is a moſt bleſſed tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the ſoul, when its internals and externals are both alike; when its inwardly towards God, what it outwardly pretends to be. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That godly ſimplicity and ſingleneſſe of heart, doth afford much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Godly ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of heart affords much comfort</note>
               </p>
               <p>The hypocritical and crafty ſelf-ſeeking man, that maketh uſe of God and holy things for his own advantage and intereſt, hath never any ſolid true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. He is compared to the <hi>ruſh that groweth in the mire,</hi> and if plucked from thence, quickly withereth, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 11. An hypocrite will not ſerve God, but where his own advantages do induce him; for hypocriſie is large, and ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:48709:215"/>
both to ſimplicity and ſincerity. The Apoſtle doth excellently comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this; and thereby appealeth to the conſciences of the <hi>Theſſalonians, 1 Theſſ. 2. 3. Our exhortation was not of deceit or guile, neither uſed we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering words, or a cloak of covetouſneſſe, nor if men ſought we glory.</hi> Oh the admirable ſimplicity that here we find in <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpirit!</p>
               <p>Now it is neceſſary to conſider the nature of this. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It floweth from an heart ſanctified and truly regenerated.</hi> No man <note place="margin">Of the uature of godly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. 1. It flows from a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied heart.</note> but he that is godly, hath this <hi>ſingleneſſe of ſpirit.</hi> Jer. 17. 9. <hi>The heart is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull above all things.</hi> The word ſignifieth the <hi>crookedneſs</hi> of it: How ready it is to ſupplant us. <hi>Jacob</hi> had his name from that root, becauſe he <hi>ſupplanted Eſau</hi> about his birthright. This is the heart of man by nature, full of conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, ſecret receſſes and holes (as it were) deceiving himſelf and others; and therefore till grace doth make pure, and we have truth in the inward parts, all is but a lie in us: Our Religion is a lie, our goodneſs is a lie, there is no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity at all. It is true indeed, there is in ſome men a natural ingenuous can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, they abhorre diſſimulation and hypocriſie; but yet this is onely one of <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> virtues, which is indeed but a <hi>ſplendid vice.</hi> For if the tree be not good the fruit cannot be: If the ſpring be bitter, ſo is the ſtream; and ſo if a man be a thorn, no ſweet grapes can grow upon him. This then we are to do, to look to the bottom, to ſearch to the original. Hath the Spirit of God made thee a new creature? then thou doeſt become faithfull and true both to God and man; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſee what the Scripture ſpeaketh of every one by nature, that he is a <hi>liar, Rom.</hi> 3. 4. Therefore till the heart be purified by grace, there is no truth and ſoundneſs within.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This ſimplicity and ſingleneſſe of ſpirit doth eye God, and looketh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods will as the only motive to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> 
                  <hi>upon his will, as the motive of his duty.</hi> The preſence of God, the omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, whereby he trieth and ſearcheth the heart, is frequently in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. It is the glory of God, the honour of God, that ſtirreth up his heart: It's not glory from men, or pleaſing of men, which doth quicken him up. For although we told you, the next word ſignifieth <hi>purity of intentions,</hi> yet one is ſo intimately connexed with the other, that they cannot be ſeparated; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs then of heart is remarkably ſeen in thoſe motives that move his ſoul; they are arguments drawn from God. You ſee this fully comprehended in that exhortation to ſervants, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 22. where they are commanded, <hi>To obey their maſters, not with eye ſervice, as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart, fearing God.</hi> They muſt look above Maſters and Governours, even to God himſelf. Now we are all ſervants to God; and therefore we ought the more diligently to have ſingleneſs of ſpirit towards him, by how much he doth infinitely exceed all other maſters. And this particular doth likewiſe ſhew, that all the moral ingenuity and verity which ſome <hi>Heathens</hi> have been famous for, was but a gliſtering Glow-worm; for they had no eye to God, neither did they reſpect him, but looked at their own glory and honour in all that they did.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Simplicity of heart is eſſentially conſiſting in the fixedneſſe of it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It is fixed upon God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
                  <hi>upon God onely, when the heart doth in the chiefeſt manner cloſe with God, and center upon him, as the ultimate end through Chriſt.</hi> And therefore <hi>ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of heart</hi> is the ſame with <hi>oneneſſe of heart.</hi> When a man doth not love God, and the world too, ſerve God, and luſts alſo. For though our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſay, <hi>This is impoſſible,</hi> yet many whoſe whole ſouls are engaged to the world, and the things of the world, do yet pleaſe themſelves, as if they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God alſo, which yet is as impoſſible, as with one eye to look down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and another to look upwards. That heart and heart which ſome Kings in the Old Teſtament are charged with, was, becauſe they did halt between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Belial;</hi> They would not ſerve God alone. Simplicity then
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48709:216"/>
is oppoſed to inconſtancy and unſetledneſſe of ſpirit, when a man doth not with full purpoſe of heart cleave to Chriſt, and take him upon all his terms, but in ſome things is for him, and in ſome things is againſt him: At ſome times he prayeth and calleth upon God; at other times again he giveth all over. This is oppoſite to ſingleneſs of heart. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calleth ſuch an one, <hi>Chap. 1. 8. A double minded man,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a man with with two ſoules,</hi> as it were. So that this very particular is greatly to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will penetrate and ſearch to the very bottome of the ſoul. Moſt men undo their ſoules in this point; they have but wiſhings and wouldings in religious things; they have aguiſh workings of heart, ſometimes hot, and ſometimes cold: They have not taken our Saviours counſel, <hi>To ſit downe, and bethink themſelves, what it will coſt them to be the Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> what luſts they can part with, what ſufferings they can endure, what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull and fervent ſervice they can doe for God: And hence it is they are like a reed ſhaken with every winde. Inſtability and inconſtancy cannot in a predominant manner conſiſt with this ſimplicity of heart, no more than heat and cold <hi>in gradu intenſo.</hi> There is no godly man but bewaileth the unſetledneſſe, the unevenneſſe of his heart, that he is not alwayes as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as heavenly-minded, as weaned from the world, as he is at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; but this is gradual only, his heart hath for the main fixed on God, though it be thus toſſed up and down; even as the ſhip may be anchored faſt to the earth, yet the waves and winds may move it up and down, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove it. Thus the heart which hath godly ſimplicity, is fundamentally faſtened upon Chriſt, although many temptations intruding may ſometimes cauſe it to ſhake and totter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Simplicity of heart is conſiſtent in the uncompounded frame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. It is not compounded.</note> It is not made up of ſeveral heterogeneals, as if there were metal of ſilver and lead, or gold and copper, and ſo is the ſame with <hi>purity.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hypocrite hath a mixt heart, it is compounded of ſeveral ingredients; for being it is glewed to the creatures, and to ſeveral luſts, becauſe theſe are many; therefore he hath not a ſimplicity, but multiplicity in his heart. Divines doe uſually make ſimplicity to be one of Gods Attributes, becauſe he is a moſt pure act compounded of no parts: Therefore he hath the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſimplicity in his Eſſence. And the Angels, they are alſo called <hi>ſimple ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</hi> becauſe they are next unto God. Yea the Philoſophers call the <hi>Heavens,</hi> though a body, yet <hi>ſimple,</hi> becauſe not compounded of elements, as ſublunary things are. The notion then of the ſimplicity of the heart is ſeen in this, when it is not compounded, it hath not the mixture of other things with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: and hence it doth appear, that no man in this life hath perfect and abſolute ſimplicity; none hath his graces wholly pure, becauſe ſome corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is mingled with our duties. There is a compoſition of wine and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of fleſh and Spirit, of Grace and Nature in the beſt, but yet it is not predominant in the godly. The tares do not choake the wheat. The <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſite</hi> doth not drive out the <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> Onely this may ſerve to keep the godly humble and low in their owne eyes; they have not that purity and ſingleneſſe of heart they ought to have, yea and earneſtly deſire. Doeſt thou ever goe about any holy duty, wherein thou doeſt not find corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſently intermingling it ſelf? Doth pure grace work alwayes? How much of fleſh and ſelf doth interpoſe? But yet for the main thy heart hath ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Simplicity conſiſteth <hi>in an even, equal and uniforme way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. 'Tis uniform in its obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> The courſe of a mans life is for the general of the ſame complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, alwayes praying, alwayes believing, alwayes mortifying of ſinne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes heavenly mindedneſſe. I doe not ſpeak this, as if there were never
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:48709:216"/>
any interruption, ſometimes natural, as in ſleep; and otherwayes, becauſe the ſoule being finite, cannot attend to many things at once; ſometimes moral by ſinne, or at leaſt careleſſe and dull affections, but the courſe of his life, or as the Scripture calls it, <hi>The way of a man,</hi> that is, generally of the ſame conſonancy: Whereas Hypocriſie is full of uneven and unequal actions, ſometimes mountaines, ſometimes valleys. There are many <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbatons,</hi> (as it were) in the oration of his life; his life doth ſpeake in different Dialects; he can ſay <hi>Sibboleth,</hi> and <hi>Shibboleth</hi> too. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> deſcribeth the godly man, as <hi>Meditating and delighting in the Law of God day and night.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh once or twice, <hi>That thoſe who are borne of God, ſinne not, neither can they:</hi> Not becauſe they have not divers infirmities, but becauſe the full purpoſe, and habitual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of ſuch a mans heart is uniformely to Gods commands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you heard, that the oppoſite to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If you looke upon many examples of thoſe, who did many things for God, yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſimplicity, you ſhall finde a great difformity in their lives; their lives ſpeake contradiction, they are not the ſame men at one time, they are at another. Thus <hi>Soul</hi> at firſt very zealous to promote the will of God; yea from this he did put all the Witches to death, and yet at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time he himſelf maketh recourſe to ſuch. So <hi>Jehu,</hi> how active is he to deſtroy <hi>Baal</hi>'s worſhip, but yet he retaineth <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s worſhip? If it was good to deſtroy <hi>Ahab</hi>'s worſhip, becauſe not commanded by God, was it not alſo good to demoliſh <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s, ſeeing that alſo had no command from God? But where there is no ſimplicity of heart, you may obſerve a great deal of unevenneſſe, yea and contradiction in that mans converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Simplicity of heart doth mainly lie in this, <hi>To have our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. Its outwards and inwards are all the ſame.</note> 
                  <hi>and inwards all of the ſame nature.</hi> To be ſuch cordially and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to God, as outwardly we appeare to be. So that if you aske, What is this ſimplicity? In the general we may ſay, the adequate conformity and agreement betweene the heart and our profeſſion. Out of the heart, we pray, we heare, we profeſſe. So that a godly man can more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly make that wiſh, than the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who wiſhed, that he had a window in his breaſt, that all men might ſee what he thought, what laie in his heart; This was great confidence. For certainly if God ſhould take a man, as he did <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and make a man look into the ſecret corners of many mens ſoules, we ſhould ſee every day more abominations. A man of this godly ſimplicity careth not if other men knew his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, whom he feareth more than man, knoweth all the motions of his ſoul. It is the complaint that God maketh of ſome by the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi> Chap. 29. 13. <hi>This people draw nigh me with their mouth, and with their lips they honour me, but remove their hearts farre from me.</hi> This is to have a double heart, ſuch want this godly ſimplicity. But oh the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and bitter mourning that we may take up in this reſpect! Have not moſt of our Congregations this <hi>double heart,</hi> and this <hi>double tongue?</hi> For what contrariety is there betweene thy religious approaches, and thy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary actions? Are ye not here to day, as if ye were an holy people, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting people, as if you did owne and acknowledge the Lord in all his commands? But what are you in your ſhops, in your markets, yea it may be in ale-houſes, and ſuch places, that doe foment iniquity? What groſſe double dealing is this with God? You have a tongue to pray to God here, and then you have a tongue to curſe and ſwear after. You ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear here to day for the ſervice and honour of God, and then in the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day you ſerve the Devil and the world. What impudent hypocriſie is this?
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:48709:217"/>
Will God be thus groſſely mocked by you? What doth not God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? Is he an Idol-god? Oh yeeld your ſelves up to that exhortation of the Apoſtle, before Gods wrath conſume you, and you cannot eſcape, <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 4. 8. <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts ye double-minded?</hi> Your hypocriſie and diſſimulation is ſo groſſe and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that did not the Devil exceedingly blinde you, you could not but take notice of it; it would riſe up in your conſciences, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Seventhly, Simplicity of heart is ſeen in this, <hi>That it dare not hide or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>

               <p>WE are treating upon this ſpecial grace of <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> which doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <note place="margin">More propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the nature of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. 1.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Where this ſimplicity is, there is an humble ſubmiſſion of the mind to the truths of God revealed in believing of them, and an obediential reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will to the commands of God, without cavils and froward disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> In this particular, the grace of <hi>ſimplicity</hi> doth triumph. Although to ſpeak properly <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> are not ſo much a diſtinct ſpecifical grace, as a qualification and modification of the powers of the ſoul, and their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In theſe two chanels of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience, doctrine</hi> and <hi>duty, ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> doth greatly diſcover it ſelf. We can neither believe ſoundly, or walk holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without this. For the former, it is plain, that ſeeing the truths of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are made known to us by divine Revelation, and therefore are above reaſon (though not contrary to it) there is no ſuch requiſite to believe, as a <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of the mind, whereby we do acquieſce upon the authority of the Word, never curiouſly diſputing and cavilling, how it can be. This the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivating every thought,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. And herein Chriſtianity differeth from Philoſophy; the later requireth ſcience by diſputes and diſcourſes; the former requireth an humble aſſent to the teſtimony, affirming ſuch a thing to be ſo. So that we may ſay, It's the want of this ſimplicity of the mind that maketh ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſurd and damnable hereſies in the Church. What cauſeth the <hi>Socinian,</hi> the <hi>Arminian,</hi> but the want of this humility of mind? It is ſaid to be the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of <hi>Nazianzen, Theologia noſtra eſt Pythagorica, Our Divinity is py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorical;</hi> as amongſt <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Diſciples <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="410" facs="tcp:48709:218"/>
circles in the water begets another. So that whereas it was <hi>Iulian</hi>'s objection againſt the Chriſtian Religion, as low and contemptible, becauſe it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>only believe;</hi> yet this indeed is the glory of it; this ſetleth and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, when philoſophical ratiocinations did carry them into endleſs contentions. Therefore that is good counſel of <hi>Auſtins, Noveris te eſſe fidelem, non rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> It is faith, not ſyllogiſms, that brings an eſtabliſhed mind in Religion. It is true indeed, Chriſtianity hath her uſe of Reaſon and Arguments, and there is an <hi>Habitus Theologiae,</hi> whereby we do demonſtrate the points of Divinity; but this is, when faith hath laid the foundation, <hi>Fides facit argumentum, non argumentum fidem,</hi> as it doth in the liberal Arts: Reaſon buildeth upon Faith, not Faith upon Reaſon. If therefore thou complaineſt of the diverſity of Sects, of the multitude of opinions that ſwarm every where, there is no ſuch way to eſcape ſplitting thy ſoul at ſuch rocks, as to pray for this <hi>godly ſimplicity</hi> of mind. I ſay <hi>holy ſimplicity,</hi> not a fooliſh, popiſh, blind obedience, that is not faith. The fool believeth every thing: Faith hath alwayes an evidence, and knowledge of the teſtimony, though the thing believed may be above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But when truths out of the Scripture are with ſufficient evidence held out to thee, then <hi>ſimplicity</hi> is required to yeeld firm aſſent thereunto, and not to diſpute by humane arguments, whether it can be ſo, or no. Therefore <hi>the wiſdome which is from above,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>eaſily to be perſwaded;</hi> As in reſpect of the objects to be believed, and the inſtruments who propound it, there is neceſſary, <hi>Piſcatoria ſimplicitas,</hi> which is more than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi>'s ſubtilty, or his <hi>Minutiloquium,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calleth it. So there is ſuch an humble ſimplicity required on the ſubjects part, who are to receive theſe divine truths. I am the larger on this, as being aſſured the beſt antidote againſt all hereſies, and the ſureſt remedy to preſerve from doctrinal Apoſtaſie, is this <hi>ſimplicity of mind.</hi> But</p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſimplicity is no leſſe ſignally ſeen in the <hi>Will,</hi> which is to caſt away its contumacy, ſtubbornneſs and propriety, reſigning it ſelf wholly up to <note place="margin">2. It ſubmits to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</note> Gods command. The Lord hath commanded it, therefore I obey, not diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with fleſh and blood, whether this will be for my advantage, honour or profit; but the will of God boweth him into all ready compliance. It is the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Phil. 2. 14. Do all things without mumurings and disputings, that ye may be ſincere.</hi> Here it is plain, that ſincerity is manifeſted, when we willingly do our duty, not murmuring and quarrelling at it. Even as we read of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though commanded by God to ſacrifice his own ſonne with his own hands, when he might have had ſo many fair arguments againſt it, yet he readily applieth himſelf to his duty; and ſo when commanded to come out of his own countrey, and to go he did not know whether, yet he willingly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; this is <hi>ſimplicity.</hi> And ſo it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> Galat. 1. who immediately obeyed the call of God, <hi>Not conſulting with fleſh and blood;</hi> whereas <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe he did not obey in <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> but waved the commands of God upon religious pretences, his <hi>rebellion</hi> was accounted a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>witchcraft,</hi> not believing that <hi>Obedience was better than Sacrifice,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This ſimplicity is ſeen in <hi>an holy boldneſſe to do our duty, to be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>zealous for God, to reprove ſinne, though there be never ſo many Lions in the way.</hi> It is true, the wiſemen of the world call this <hi>ſimplicity</hi> indeed, making it the ſame with <hi>folly.</hi> Thus moſt of our Chriſtian duties, if fervently and zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly performed, are nothing but folly and ſillineſs to carnal policy. But to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for God, and to own his wayes among a crooked and malicious people, is an excellent mark of <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> whereas hypocriſie meaſuring all things by its ſafety, honour and profit, becometh like the ſhadow to the body, ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth it ſelf to every corrupt humour of others. But this plainneſs of heart maketh us with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. to ſpeak of the Law even before Kings, and alwayes to obey

God, rather than men. So much ſhrinking from thy duty, becauſe of the fear or favours of men is ſo much want of ſimplicity. Hence <hi>Varinus</hi> makes <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>boldneſſe and freedome.</hi> Oh then pray exceedingly for this ſimplicity of ſpirit, that will make thee conſtant, bold and zealous for God! How often may thy conſcience convince thee, that ſinfull fear, or fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſhame, or carnal affections have made thee not do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is true, there is Chriſtian prudence required alſo, there muſt be <hi>the wiſdome of a Serpent,</hi> as well as the <hi>innocency of the Dove.</hi> Diſcretion is the ſalt to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our Sacrifices, and there muſt be this ſalt, as well as the fire of zeal; but we muſt look the Serpent doth not eat up this Dove; that diſcretion doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>Thus much of ſimplicity, as it relateth immediately to God. Now becauſe <note place="margin">Of ſimplicity towards men.</note> the Apoſtle uſeth the word largely, relating to his miniſterial converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it did reach to men, we ſhall take in briefly the conſideration of that alſo.

               <p>Firſt, Godly ſimplicity maketh a man inoffenſive to men. <hi>This ſimplicity</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. It makes a man blameleſs as to others.</note> 
                  <hi>maketh a man harmleſſe and unblameable, as to others.</hi> Chriſts Diſciples are compared to Sheep, not to Bears for cruelty, or Foxes for craft in doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is as much as <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if to ſay, <hi>without horns.</hi> The people of God are meek and lowly, as it's ſaid of <hi>Jacob, He was a plain man,</hi> but <hi>Eſau rough and hairy;</hi> which may relate to their manners, as well as bodily conſtitutions; not but that they can be as bold as Lions in the cauſe of God.

               <p>Secondly, <hi>This ſimplicity of ſpirit in reference to man is accompanied with ingenuity, candour and truth.</hi> His heart and his words, his promiſes and his <note place="margin">2.

How carefull is the Apoſtle towards the end of this Chapter (and ſomething this Text is relating to that) to clear himſelf from inconſtancy and falſhood, as if he were <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay?</hi> So that ſimplicity is accompanied with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in affections, and veracity in promiſes. There is a conformity between the mind and words. The <hi>Ieſuite</hi> by his principles of equivocation, calling it <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens defentio,</hi> is farre from this ſimplicity the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here doth rejoyce in. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle, (lib. 4. Ethic. cap.</hi> 17.) maketh this verity to be a moral virtue, though he ſaith the <hi>Greeks</hi> have no name for it, he placeth it in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two extreams, the one is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when a man doth <hi>boaſt</hi> and <hi>brag</hi> of ſuch things in him, which are not indeed. Thus the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the civil man, yea <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf for all his moral Philoſophy, were guilty of this arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, attributing that to themſelves, which was not in them. <hi>Simplicity</hi> giveth all to God, nothing to his own power. The other extream is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when men do <hi>diſſemble</hi> the good things that are in them, will not own them. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> maketh <hi>Socrates</hi> guilty of this. Now it's true, there may be much hypocriſie in diſpraiſing our ſelves; and we may affect humility, when thereby we exalt our pride. So that the child of God which hath this ſimplicity, is bound to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:48709:219"/>
the good things God hath done for him, and in him; it is not pride but thankfulneſſe to do ſo. <hi>Paul</hi> did not arrogantly boaſt, when he profeſſeth his <hi>ſimplicity;</hi> it was not pride to own his ſincerity. And this is neceſſary for the godly to be informed in; for they are ſo jealous and ſuſpicious of themſelves, that they dare not ſay, they feel what they do feel. If Chriſt ſhould ask them as <hi>Peter, Loveſt thou me?</hi> They would ſtand amazed, not knowing, what to ſay, when yet at the ſame time all their trouble is, becauſe they love Chriſt no more, and becauſe they do not arrive at ſuch a pitch of holines as they deſire. Know then, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> by the light of nature, ſo much more a <hi>Christian</hi> by the light of grace may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it is a ſin, contrary to that ſimplicity that ſhould be in us, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg what God hath done for us. Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pleaded the truth of his ſoul; and <hi>Paul</hi> here, and alſo in many other places, profeſſeth his uprightneſſe of heart, and abundant labouring for the propagation of the Goſpel; neither could they be charged with pride and arrogancy herein. By which we ſee, that as a man in the ſimplicity of his heart is carried out to the whole ſervice of God; ſo he doth herein take notice of, and acknowledge the grace of God towards him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is our duty to obſerve, and thankfully acknowledge the graces of God in us, provided alwayes we avoid thoſe particulars, which <hi>Carthuſian</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>diſt.</hi> in a verſe, that do alwayes pollute or puff up.

               <p n="1">1. By way of oppoſition, to that <hi>Natural, or Moral Truth, and Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which may be in men deſtitute of grace. The <hi>Romana fides</hi> was proverbial, becauſe of the truth and ſincerity that was in all their dealings; but becauſe they did not know God, or look up to him, referring their actions to lower and more inferiour ends; therefore it was not <hi>godly ſincerity.</hi> Thus many
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:48709:220"/>
civil men have an honeſt, upright heart to doe truly and righteouſly in all things relating to men, but they want the ſoul of all, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this to the glory of God, and to eye him principally in their actions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be called, <hi>The ſincerity of God, effectivè,</hi> becauſe it is that which is wrought in us by God. The heart naturally is full of guile and hypocriſie, never performing holy things upon holy motives. So that it is the grace of God, which putteth truth in the inward parts, and maketh us Sheep of Foxes, Doves of Kites.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the <hi>ſincerity of God,</hi> by way of direction and command, becauſe he hath commanded, that with a pure and upright heart, we are to ſerve him in all our wayes. And this our Tranſlators ſeem to aim at, rendring it <hi>godly ſincerity,</hi> that is, ſuch which is according to the rules of Gods word. And this excludeth that <hi>ſincerity of conſcience,</hi> which many heretical and deluded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may have in their zealous proſecution of their falſe wayes. <hi>Paul</hi> had a good conſcience, and a ſincere heart, while a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> that he did not go againſt the dictates of his conſcience; yea he thought himſelf bound to doe what he did: But this is not enough to godly ſincerity, this is humane ſincerity, thou haſt a clear perſwaſion in thy own heart of the goodneſſe of thy wayes; but if it be godly, it muſt be according to the rule of godlineſſe, and that is the Scripture. A mans own conſcience or heart is not the ſupream rule of ſincerity, but the Scripture. And this is very neceſſary to be obſerved, becauſe we are apt to reſt in our hearts, the ſincerity we feel there, the comfort and quietneſſe we have from thence, as if they were the utmoſt rule we were to reſolve all into; whereas it muſt not be, what ſay our hearts, but what ſay the Scriptures inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and regulating our hearts?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may be called <hi>ſincerity of God, finaliter,</hi> becauſe whatſoever a man doth, that is thus ſincere, he doth it to the glory of God; that is his mark, if he falleth ſhort of that, if he findeth his own glory, his own applauſe, his owne advantages interpoſing, this doth exceedingly grieve and trouble him; he accounts that as droſſe, and not gold, he ſaith, This duty I have loſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is called <hi>ſincerity of God, objectivè,</hi> becauſe he that is ſincere, doth all things as in the preſence of God, knowing that God beholdeth him, that he trieth the reins, and ſearcheth the hearts of all men. And this is principally meant in this place (though the other be not excluded.) And ſo we have <hi>Paul</hi> explaining himſelf in the next Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. As of <hi>ſincerity, as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things explained, Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That godly ſincerity carrieth a man above all ſelf-respects in religious wayes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Godly ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty carrieth a man above all other things to God himſelf</note>

               </p>
               <p>It is not man, either glory, or praiſe from him, but God alone that his heart is fixed upon. As thoſe that did runne in a race (ſuch is our Chriſtianity) did not matter the acclamations of ſpectators, but the judgement of him who was the Moderator, to judge on whoſe ſide the victory was. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. <hi>It is a very ſmall thing with me, that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judgement, but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> It is a miſerable bondage to pleaſe men, and to be like a looking-glaſſe to every one, ſeeming to be what he is, that he talketh with: ſuch a man is inconſtant, hypocritical, changeth the wayes of Religion often, according as humane advantages do intervene; whereas the ſincere man, like Chriſt himſelf, is the <hi>ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Like thoſe fiſhes, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his contemplations, by the Sea

ſide, obſerved that keeping cloſe to the rock were not moved, but the reſt were caſt out, and are fetched in again according to the ebbing and flowing of the waters: but he that walketh with ſincerity, as God is the ſame, the Scriptures the ſame, godlineſſe is alwayes the ſame, ſo alſo is he the ſame. As the Pilot hath his eye alwayes to the Starre in the Heavens, not regarding the tempeſts, or toſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ings of his ſhip. Thus it is with the ſincere man.</p>
               <p>To work this upon our hearts, let us conſider, <note place="margin">What it is in God that a ſincere heart looks upon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>What are thoſe things in God, that the ſincere man doth thus fix himſelf upon, living as if there were none in the world, but he and God alone.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Omniſcience of God,</hi> that all-ſeeing eye of his, whereby he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">1. His Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> every ſecret turning, and winding of the ſoul, yea <hi>our thoughts afarre off,</hi> while they are but in the minting and womb, and thereby ſeeth that in us, which we cannot our ſelves. This is that, which is often in the thoughts of a ſincere man. This all ſearching knowledge of God, <hi>David</hi> largely celebrateth, <hi>Pſal. 139. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> Thus God commandeth <hi>Abraham, To walk before him, and be perfect,</hi> Gen. 17. The conſideration of Gods preſence, that he is with us, that he knoweth every thought, and every word, this will make us perfect and upright. Had <hi>Gehezi</hi> thought that <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſpirit would have gone along with him, as it were, and taken notice of the actions he did, he would not with ſuch confidence have come into the Prophets preſence, as if all had been well. Oh then, how vain is it to hide thy deſigns and intentions to men, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations and profeſſions of thy integrity to men, if the all-ſeeing eye of God behold other things in thee? What greater obligation can there be, to have all the motions and turnings of thy heart cordial and faithfull towards God, ſeeing no man can more perfectly behold the outward geſtures of thy body, then he doth the inward motions of thy ſoul? Oh ſay. God knoweth what I think, what my heart is upon, what is the ſpring of every duty I do!</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sincerity reſpecteth God, <hi>As he is the firſt cauſe, and the laſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. His being the firſt cauſe and the laſt end.</note> 
                  <hi>end.</hi> The <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the <hi>beginning</hi> and the <hi>end, of whom are all things, and to whom are all things,</hi> Rom. 11. 36. Now this two-fold property in God, the ſincere man doth greatly improve. Firſt, As he is the <hi>Efficient cauſe,</hi> ſo that he expects all-ſufficiency and power from the grace of God alone. The Scripture dot frequently affirm, That it is by the grace of God <hi>alone,</hi> that we are able to do any good thing; therefore the ſincere man dareth not ſacrifice to his own nets, dare not give any thing to his own power and free-will, neither dare he rob Chriſt of his glory, by ſetting up Angels and Saints, as Mediators, under any nice diſtinctions whatſoever; he trembleth to diſpute againſt the grace of God, leſt he want the bleſſed effects of it in the greateſt neceſſities. You may obſerve <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who expreſſe ſuch remarkable ſincerity towards God, that they go out of themſelves, depend on God alone: and not onely do they acknowledge God the ſupream giver of all the good they enjoy, but alſo they make him the ultimate end, to whom they referre all things; remembring the Apoſtles rule, 1 <hi>Cor. 10 31. Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> This is a very hard leſſon to do, a very difficult duty to be performed; but yet the <hi>ſincere man,</hi> he overlooketh all ſecond cauſes and inſtruments with his Eagles-eye; he gets up (as it were) into the mountain, and leaveth all his carnal intereſts below, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his beaſts and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when he went to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac.</hi> This ſingle and pure intention of Gods glory, is not ſo eaſily accompliſhed, as it is quickly and commonly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Oh how rare a thing is it to eat and drink, to ſtudy and preach, that hereby God may be glorified? How cloſely doth ſome carnal reſpect, or vain-glorious motive follow thee in the duty, as <hi>Aſahel</hi> did <hi>Joab,</hi> which thou canſt not make depart from thee, till thou thruſt it (as it were)
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:48709:221"/>
thorow the fift rib, till thou give it its mortal blow by mortification.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſincere heart relateth all to God, <hi>In regard of his Sovereignty</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. His ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and dominion.</note> 
                  <hi>and dominion over him.</hi> Becauſe God is the ſupream Lord and Lawgiver, who only can impoſe Laws upon the conſcience; therefore in his obedience he doth principally look to the will and authority of the Lawgiver. This is a notable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ity, to obey, becauſe thus ſaith the Lord; it is his will, and as the ſupream orb doth carry along with it the inferiour orbs, though againſt their particular inclination: Thus doth the will of God, becauſe ſupream, bring the creatures will into obedience, when corrupt inclinations do propound a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way. It is the matter of our prayer which we are conſtantly to pour forth unto God, <hi>That his will may be done, his will, not our will.</hi> Therefore if ſincerity have a throne in thy heart, thy ſenſe will be as ſoft wax to receive any ſtamp or impreſſion from God; what God commands, though againſt pleaſures, profits, and all the inclinations of thy corrupt heart, thou doeſt readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto. Thus thou offereſt up thy ſelf as an whole burnt-offering unto God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This ſincerity doth reſpect the <hi>wiſdome of God, in all thoſe ſharp, and bitter providential temptations that a man may be exerciſed with, for his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. The wiſdom of God.</note> 
                  <hi>faithfull ſervice to God.</hi> The Scripture doth frequently inform of this, what cups of wormwood they muſt drink that will be Chriſts Diſciples, what crowns of thorns they muſt endure upon their heads, who expect crowns of glory from him. Now the heart that is ſincere, doth not cavil and murmur at Gods diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations herein, though ſo unpleaſing to fleſh and blood, but doth wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the wiſdom of God, filencing the impetuous motions of his Spirit; God is wiſer than I, he knoweth this is better for me, then I think it is. For certainly all diſcontents do ariſe from this, we think God might have ſhewed more love to us, and more wiſdome, if he did not ſuffer ſuch and ſuch things to come upon us: Therefore afflictions and perſecutions are the ſpecial Touchſtone to diſcover our ſincerity. This fire will manifeſt whether we be gold or droſſe, theſe winnowings whether chaffor wheat. The hypocrite wanting root, doth commonly begin to wither, when the Sunnes ſcorching heat doth ariſe; and if they are at any times afflicted for Chriſt, it is againſt their wils, ſo that with <hi>Simon,</hi> they are compelled to carry the croſſe of Chriſt; but ſincerity doth not only admire the wiſdome of God in ſuch diſpenſations, but juſtifieth him, and condemneth its ſelf. Thus you ſee, what are thoſe high and ſublime things a ſincere man looketh at in all his religious wayes: That whereas in a bodily way, the beaſt looketh to the ground, when man hath an upright look towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: So even every natural man hath a ſoul bowed down only to earthly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, while the ſincere heart aſcends up to God himſelf. Therefore it is that he doth prudently eſcape all thoſe ambuſhments that low inferiour ends, are apt to lay in his way, thereby to intercept him from arriving at God himſelf. We cannot reckon all the inferiour and unworthy ends that are apt to interpoſe, no more than the creeping things in the Sea; onely ſome few we may inſtance in. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Vain-glory and Self-applauſe,</hi> that many times clippeth the wings of our <note place="margin">What are thoſe inferiour ends which interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God our ſouls, which we are apt to look upon. 1. Vain-glory.</note> ſouls, that while we are moving to Heaven, this maketh us fall to the ground. This made the <hi>Phariſees</hi> loſe the heavenly reward of all their religious duties. And how often have the holieſt of men complained of this <hi>Dalilah,</hi> this ſweet poiſon, this flattering enemy; Is it not the worme that devoureth the ſweeteſt flowers, and the ripeſt fruit? This maketh death in the pot, even damnation in excellent duties; therefore the ſincere man doth conſtantly watch and ward, keeping a ſtrict ſearch into his heart, that no ſuch thief enter in and ſteal away his treaſure.</p>
               <p>A ſecond inferiour and baſe end, which would corrupt us in the ſervice of
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48709:221"/>
God, is <hi>The external greatneſſe of honour, or the ſeeming profit of wealth.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Honour and riches.</note> This duſt hath often blown into the eyes, that they have not been able to look up. What glorious things did <hi>Jehu</hi> do for God? If you look upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal actions only? But his heart was not ſincere in this, it was a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdome that he aimed at, and the earthly advancing of himſelf. And the third kind of hearers, they did not apoſtatize, but the love of the world, and the deceiveableneſſe of riches; theſe things like weeds did grow up with the good corne. It was <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his hainous tranſgreſſion, to deſire the Holy Ghoſt for money. And hath not this been as wickedly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſometimes to make uſe of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, or at leaſt the pretence of them for earthly gaine? To be religious for gaine, to make a profeſſion for earthly advantages, what is this but to make uſe of God and his wayes for money? And if you ſay, Theſe are baſe and unworthy ends indeed, this is to be a <hi>Judas,</hi> to ſell Chriſt for money, an <hi>Eſau,</hi> to ſell our birthright for pottage. Therefore you muſt know, that if we could as the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> enjoyne, do virtuous actions for virtues ſake; yet this were too low an end for a ſincere Chriſtian; when men do righteous actions for the publick good; when men performe religious duties meerly to pleaſe and content their conſciences. Theſe that are good, as proxime and ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ends, being made the ultimate, do deprive the duties of their true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſincere Chriſtianity. This is to take <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> for <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or as ſome did, to take <hi>Christ</hi> onely for ſome <hi>great Prophet.</hi> This is to judge ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and godlineſſe a leſſe thing than it is; to take a counterfeit, for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearl. And therefore the motive of duties in Popery, is wonderfully ſhort of true ſpiritual ones; even as their faith of true divine motives, as they reſolve their faith into the Authority of their Church, ſo their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties into their own power and merit. Whereas to be holy, ſo as to reſt in our holineſſe, and to make that our utmoſt end, is to unthrone Chriſt, and to put our graces in the room of Gods grace. So that we are not onely by ſincerity to overlook all earthly objects, but even all duties and inherent graces, joyning with Chriſt onely as the beloved of our ſouls. This ſincerity is that which maketh the way to Heaven ſo narrow. This is the reaſon why many are called, but few choſen. If the external performance of duties were enough, many thouſands would go to Heaven, more than do: but ſincerity is that which makes every holy duty ſo difficult.</p>

                     </gap>, filled up.</hi> There were many empty hollow places and vacuities, as it were, wanting this grace, and that duty which would have made her compleat. Now there are ſeveral kinds of <hi>Univerſalities,</hi> wherein this ſincerity doth diſcover it ſelf. There is an univerſality of the <hi>Object matter,</hi> about which it is exerciſed: It maketh a man carefull to performe the greateſt duties, and the leſſe duties: It ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth nothing little, wherein the command of God is concerned, that is a great God: It abſtaineth from great ſinnes and little ſinnes: It account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no ſinne little, which cannot be purged away, but by the blood of Chriſt. Again, it doth faithfully reſpect all the <hi>Commandments of God,</hi> ſuch as are terminated upon God himſelf, or ſuch as relate to man. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed this ſincerity, when he called it, <hi>A conſcience void of offence both towards God and man,</hi> Act. 24. 16. He knoweth true Religion cannot be without righteouſneſſe; nor godly righteouſneſſe without the duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Furthermoee, there are duties of ſuffering for Chriſt, as well as of doing for him: Sometimes it is farre more unpleaſing to fleſh and blood to ſuffer for Chriſt, then to be doing for him. But the ſincere heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for both, he doth not capitulate with Chriſt about what he ſhall be put upon: Therefore it is that he is willing to take up the croſſe, and to follow Chriſt; he accepteth of thoſe duties, where ſelf-denial, and ſelf-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification are requiſite, as thoſe which may be more gratefull and acceptable
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48709:222"/>
unto a man. Oh how much eaſier is it to preach theſe things, and to hear theſe things, then to practiſe them! As there is an univerſality of the <hi>Object,</hi> ſo alſo of the <hi>Subject</hi> where this is; every part of the ſoul is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. There is not illumination without ſanctification; gifts without grace: but the whole man is rightly conſtituted. Hence we told you, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity is not properly a grace, but it's the modification of grace, every grace is to be <hi>ſincere,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 5. There is a <hi>pure heart, a good conſcience, and faith unfeigned.</hi> So that ſincerity is a property, and an affection of every grace; it's not repentance, unleſſe ſincere; it's not faith, except ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. Again, There is an <hi>Univerſality of time and place.</hi> A ſincere man is godly in times of proſperity, as well as of adverſity; in times of health, as well as of ſickneſſe; on the week day, as well as the Sabbath. And ſo for <hi>places, Paul</hi> ſaith in the Text, it was <hi>in the world,</hi> as well as at <hi>Corinth.</hi> At ſome times, in ſome places, and with ſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to pretend onely for God, this diſcovereth hypocriſie in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sincerity is herein remarkable, <hi>That it goeth to the bottome and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Sincerity goeth to the bottom of ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>root of ſinne.</hi> It doth not onely take away the external acts, and ſo make a ſmooth skinne, but it giveth good vitals and inwards: eſpecially it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt that rotten core, that is in every man, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a deceitfull and falſe heart towards God and man. It is knowne, what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> concludeth of every man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 11. which the Apoſtle maketh uſe of, <hi>Rom. 3. 4. Every man is a lyar;</hi> that is of himſelfe, and in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; otherwiſe <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> were not lyars in delivering of this truth, neither are regenerate men lyars, ſo farre as the Spirit of God doth ſanctifie them. But naturally the hearts of all men are deceitfull, full of lies and falſhoods towards God, as if they loved him, as if they repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when yet ſelf is the motive that ſetteth all on work: and no leſſe falſe is it to man alſo. It is true indeed, commonly it is interpreted by good Expoſitors, as if this ſpeech did come from <hi>David</hi> in unbelief, that it was the weakneſſe of his faith, thinking as if <hi>Samuel,</hi> and other Prophets had deceived him about the Kingdome. But in this ſenſe, there would have been a falſhood in the ſpeech; neither would the Apoſtle then have made that uſe of it, as he doth. Beſides, at the verſe before, he ſaith, <hi>I believed, therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> which the Apoſtle alſo maketh uſe of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and boldneſſe in the profeſſion of our faith; therefore it may very well be, that <hi>David</hi> from the ſtrength of his faith now in his perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (for that haſte he ſpeaketh of, is to be underſtood of his flight, and running from place to place) doth encourage himſelfe from the truth of God, and is not diſmayed to ſee <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and all his people prove falſe and perfidious: for the corrupt nature of man inclineth him to no better. If then the heart of a man be ſo naturally prone to be falſe towards God and man, to be mercenary to ſeek our ſelves, to be hypocrites. This is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of ſincerity, that it eateth away the rotten fleſh at the bottome. Hence</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>It is becauſe of this ſincerity, that the way to Heaven</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Hence it is that it is ſo hard to be a Chriſtian.</note> 
                  <hi>is ſuch a ſtreight, and narrow way:</hi> That Godlineſſe is ſo rare a Jewel, <hi>That many are called, but few are choſen;</hi> becauſe though there be many duties, many religious profeſſions, yet little ſincerity of ſpirit. Oh, if there were no more required to goe to Heaven, than to hear, pray, keep up an external forme of Religion, different from the courſe of the world, How eaſie and broad would the way to Heaven be? Many thouſands more would goe to Heaven than doe: But this is that which makes it ſo difficult
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:48709:223"/>
a thing to be ſaved; becauſe no duty, no religious performances are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, but rejected by God, which come not from a ſincere and true principle of grace within: It is not then praying, but ſincere praying: It is not hearing, but ſincere hearing: Yea Martyrdome without ſincerity, is but the Devils Sacrifice: So that experience will teach thee to ſet upon religious duties, from principles of ſincerity, is a farre more difficult task, then thou ever thoughtſt of; while going on in a formal, cuſtomary way, Heaven could never be ſo difficultly obtained; neither could thoſe Texts of Scripture, which ſpeak of the holy violence and agonies that muſt be in the way to Heaven, were the externals of Religion enough; but it is ſincerity in theſe actings that maketh the ſtreights. When we ſet upon that, then we ſee how far nature, education, cuſtom, and formality may carry us, and yet want the ſoul and life of all.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Fourthly, <hi>Sincerity is the proper characteriſtical difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Sincerity is the proper difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour, and a true believer.</note> 
                  <hi>a temporary in Chriſtianity, and a true convert.</hi> It is one of the greateſt practical Queſtions in Divinity that is, What is that, which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between the common graces of Gods Spirit, and the ſpecial? Or, What are the bounds and limits, whereby we may know to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an enlightned hypocrite, fervent in all external, religious duties, and he who is cordially, and truly ſo? The Queſtion is, Whether it be a ſpecifical or gradual difference? And what is that, which the truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth? And the fooliſh Virgin, or fooliſh builder cannot do? And if we deſcend not to particulars, but ſpeak in the general, then we muſt ſay, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity is the eſſentiall difference. So that as rationality maketh the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference between a man, and a beaſt: ſo doth ſincerity between the truly godly, and the ſeeming ſo onely. This made the difference between <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> between many Kings record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old Teſtament, who did very much in the wayes of the Lord; and thoſe who did ſeek God with all their heart. So that by this you ſee, how much it lieth us upon to look after ſincerity in duties, more than du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; after ſincerity in gifts and religious abilities, more than gifts: for this maketh the Chriſtian. The other are but as the body and garments, this is the ſoul. All thy glorious building muſt be pulled down, if this be not the foundation. It is no matter what ſtanding thy Diſcipleſhip to Chriſt is of, nor how famous thy gifts and parts are, nor what an intereſt thou haſt in the thoughts of Profeſſours, nor what a ſtricter way of Church-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou mayeſt ſeeme to ſet upon, if ſincerity be not the ſalt to ſeaſon all. Oh then that Chriſtians would ſtudy more in this point, meditate about it, read about it, knowing that this is all in all! If this be not the firſt ſtone laid in thy ſpiritual building; when ſtormes ariſe, thy building will fall, and thy fall will be the greater, by how much the appearances of holineſſe have been the greater. Therefore it is that ſincerity is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by Divines the <hi>Gospel-perfection,</hi> when many are ſaid, <hi>To ſeeke God with a perfect heart;</hi> the meaning is not, as if there were no ſinnes or imperfections cleaving to them; but becauſe they were upright and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere: Though weak faith, yet if ſincere faith: Though imperfect love, yet if ſincere love; this hath a kinde of Goſpel-perfection. Hence of all the deceits in the world, none is more dangerous and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then when we take our ſelves for upright and ſincere, but are not.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Sincerity doth carry a man on in religious wayes from principles</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Sincerity carries us through du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</note> 
                  <hi>of voluntarineſſe and delight within.</hi> Outward motives may make falſe hearts towards God ſet upon many notable ſervices; as we ſee in <hi>Iehu</hi>
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:48709:223"/>
and <hi>Iudas,</hi> &amp;c. But here was no voluntary and delightſome principle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For a man will never ſincerely leave the ſweetneſſe of his luſts and profits he had in a carnal way, till he finde infinitely more ſweetneſſe, and delight in heavenly things. So that this doth neceſſarily accompany ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it maketh a man voluntary and willing, with joy and delight in the whole work of God; <hi>Pſalm 110. 3. Thy people ſhall be willing (wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſes) in the day of thy power.</hi> It is true, even the moſt upright doe ſometimes finde much deadneſſe and unwillingneſſe to ho y things; there is a weariſomneſſe and averſneſſe they ſometimes feele; but this is an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden to them: They cry out to God, to quicken them, to draw them, to enliven them; whereas the inſincere man is carried out by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal motives: Even as when the water maketh the Mill runne round, that of it ſelf would never move, becauſe it wanteth life within. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that expreſſion of <hi>Iob</hi> is obſerveable, <hi>Iob 27. 10. Will he delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Almighty? Will he alwayes call upon God?</hi> The inſincere man cannot delight in God, and therefore his duties are not conſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual: whereas this ſincerity doth fill the heart with internal principles of joy, readineſſe and delight in the wayes of God. Hence it is that the favour of God, and the light of his countenance enjoyed by faith, doe take him off from all the delight he formerly had in other things. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> who was carried out with a vehement and moſt flagrant deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge and learning, which made him try all the ſeveral Sects of the Philoſophers, as alſo to fall into the <hi>Maniehee-</hi>hereſie: When it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to make a powerfull, ſincere and effectual change upon his ſoul, then he ſaid of all the ſciences, formerly ſo dear to him, <hi>Nunc prae illius amore vix veniunt in mentem.</hi> The love of God made him ſcarce ever thinke of them. This makes grace natural (as it were) becauſe the principle is within.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Sincerity making a man thus to worke from a principle of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe <note place="margin">6. Sincerity makes a man find grace to be a reall thing.</note> and delight within, <hi>Therefore it is that he findes grace to be a real lively thing within him.</hi> Inſincerity maketh a man have onely confuſed and general apprehenſions about grace: whereas uprightneſſe giveth a man a reall taſte and experimental feeling of the ſame within him. A man without this reall power of grace, under the moſt glorious profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but as a pictured man, or a painted fire. Who were more diligent in the externall ſtudy of the Law, than the <hi>Iewes?</hi> How greatly did they glory in the knowledge thereof, as if they had come out of the Fathers boſome? Yet obſerve what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>(Iohn</hi> 5. 37.) to them, <hi>Ye have neither heard his voice, or ſeene his ſhape at any time:</hi> That is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had not powerfull, experimentall diſcoveries of God upon their ſoules: or though they had heard Gods voice many times in their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and had ſeene many apparitions of God by Angels, yet becauſe Chriſts word did not abide in them, it's accounted, as if they never had any knowledge at all. Hence grace is often compared to life. Now as a man that is alive, feeleth and knoweth himſelfe to be ſo: Thus, where this ſpiritual worke of grace is ſincerely putting it ſelfe forth, there the ſoul hath much reality in the ſenſe of it. It maketh a man diſcourſe and conferre about that, of which he hath experience; as <hi>Paul,</hi> Galat. 2. 26. <hi>I no longer live, but Chriſt in me.</hi> Many ſpeake of grace, as ſome doe of ſtrance Countreyes, wherein they never travelled. What they have by Books and Mapps that they diſcover. Thus it is with many, they know nothing of Regeneration, of the New-creature, but what they have by Bookes, or by hearing of Sermons, and therefore have not ſuch a reall,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48709:224"/>
evident and clear apprehenſion of Gods grace, as they ſhould have. Now it's ſincerity that maketh all things to be reall, and in power, not in name and words onely. And from this reall lively working of grace ſincerely in us, we come to have much aſſurance and comfort in our hearts, as <hi>Paul</hi> here in the Text, his rejoycing was from the teſtimony of his conſcience concerning his ſincerity. Therefore the hypocrite he never attaineth to any ſolid joy, or any powerfull aſſurance about the favour of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. This experience of the love of God ſincerely and really wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the heart of <hi>Peter,</hi> as fire in the boſome, made him againe and againe ſay to Chriſt, <hi>That he loved him.</hi> And thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> in thoſe reall and affectionate workings of Gods grace upon him, made him ſo bold as to ſay, <hi>(Lib. 10. Confeſſ. cap.</hi> 6.) So <hi>Ianſenius</hi> conjoyneth the words, <hi>Non dubiâ, ſed certâ conſcientiâ Domine, amo te, percuſſiſti cor meum verbo tuo, &amp; amavi. O Lord, I am ſure in my conſcience that I love thee; Thou haſt ſmitten me, and wounded my heart with thy Word, and therefore I love thee.</hi> So that let a man goe on in a formall, cuſtomary, empty way of Religion: Let him pray, heare and profeſſe Godlineſſe, but all this while without ſincerity, and the power of it; and afterwards God breake his heart, new mould him, make him a new creature, he will then finde ſuch a wonderfull change, and ſee grace to be ſuch another power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing in his ſoule over once he thought; that he will even ſtand ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee, what he is. Oh little did I know, did I feele what now I doe! When ſome few dropp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of this precious ointment ſhall fall into his ſoule, then the ſweetneſſe will be incredible, not onely to others, but alſo to himſelfe, which he findes within him. Thus ſincerity doth cauſe reall, lively, and aſſured comfortable motions of the ſoule in heavenly things. Not that the ſincere are alwayes on this Mount of transfiguration: No, they are in a wilderneſſe ſometimes, as well as in a <hi>Canaan;</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is the nature of ſincerity ſo to doe. Thus it is in the <hi>Idea,</hi> though in the ſubject there are many times divers imperfections and weakneſſes. To be ſure no ſpirituall thing, whether it be of grace or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a Chriſtian heart, can be carried on without much combate and conflict.</p>

               <p>THe next particular conſiderable, is the manner of <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſation in this world, expreſſed negatively, <hi>Not with fleſhly wiſdome.</hi> This is made contrary to that <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> he had mentioned before. Only the expreſſion doth imply a two-fold <hi>wiſdome,</hi> the one <hi>heavenly, and from above;</hi> This the Apoſtle doth not deny, but at other times doth aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There is a civil prudence neceſſary in all Church-Officers to feed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their flock. There is alſo a <hi>ſpiritual wiſdome,</hi> whereby we are able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and to diſcover the myſteries of God. Theſe are an excellent gift of God. And therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. when the Apoſtle had renounced all excellency of ſpeech, and <hi>mans wiſdome,</hi> as he calleth it, yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. he corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his expreſſion, ſaying, <hi>Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdome, yet not the wiſdome of this world.</hi> So then, <hi>Mans wiſdome,</hi> the <hi>wiſdom of the world,</hi> is the ſame which is here called <hi>fleſhly wiſdome.</hi> So that (I ſay) the expreſſion doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a diviſion of wiſdome into <hi>heavenly</hi> or <hi>divine;</hi> The <hi>wiſdome from above;</hi> and that which is <hi>carnal</hi> or <hi>fleſhly,</hi> the Apoſtle calleth it <hi>ſenſual and deviliſh, Jam.</hi> 3. 15, 17.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>wiſdome</hi> in the Text may be called <hi>fleſhly,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe of the root and original of it,</hi> which is the ſinfull corruption in <note place="margin">Why carnal wiſdom cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fleſhly.</note> man. For fleſh is many times taken for <hi>ſinfulneſſe,</hi> as well as for <hi>weakneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be called <hi>fleſhly, Becauſe it forſaketh the rules given in Gods word,</hi> that is the proper fountain of wiſdome, which alone is able to <hi>make us wiſe to ſalvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15. and walketh according to the preſcripts of humane and ſinfull policy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be called <hi>fleſhly, Becauſe the end and effects of it, are onely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance man, and carnal intereſt;</hi> not that all glory and honour may be given to Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>So that by this <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> we are to underſtand all crafty, falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull wayes; yea and all that pride and ſwelling in humane learning and orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which the falſe Apoſtles gloried in. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Miniſters of the Gospel are to carry on their work without any fleſhly</hi>

                  <hi>wiſdome, or ſinfull policy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods truth doth not need mans lie. The Goſpel doth not want for its propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the craft and fraud of ungodly policy. Howſoever Politicians take up
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48709:225"/>
many rules about worldly greatneſs; as, <hi>Qui neſcit diſſimulare, neſcit reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare,</hi> &amp;c. And with <hi>Plato,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That a lie is as neceſſary in a Common-wealth, as phyſick to a diſeaſed body.</hi> Yet as Chriſt himſelf, ſo all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt are to be without guile in their mouth. The Goſpel of Chriſt is preſerved and propagated onely by ſuch heavenly and holy meanes, that God will own, and give a bleſſing unto. Chriſt compareth his Diſciples to <hi>Sheep,</hi> not to <hi>Foxes.</hi> It is true, there is a <hi>Serpentine wiſdome</hi> commended by Chriſt. And our Saviour commiſſionating his Diſciples to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, biddeth them, <hi>To beware of men,</hi> Mat. 10. 17. but an offenſive, or a deceitfull way of walking, that is not beſeeming the Miniſters of Chriſt. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth frequently diſclaime it, eſpecially, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. There are two falſe wayes of propagating Religion, as <hi>Gerhard</hi> obſerveth, <hi>(Cathol. confeſſ. parte prim.) Media violentiae,</hi> and <hi>Media fraudulentiae.</hi> The means of <hi>violence</hi> may be either in external, temporal puniſhments; or in tyrannical unreaſonable Church impoſitions, which later the Apoſtle doth alſo renounce, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. Both which wayes the Antichriſtian party are notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in. And there are <hi>Media fraudulentiae,</hi> wayes of <hi>hypocriſie and deceit,</hi> uſing ſubtil and unjuſtifiable wayes to bring about their religious deſigns. Now although it be the Goſpel that we would extoll; though the holy truths, and pure worſhip of Chriſt, yet we muſt not make uſe of <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> herein, but walk by Scripture-rules. For it's Gods grace, not mans policy, gives ſucceſſe to the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Of this latter we are to treat. And we are the more to conſider this point, for three Reaſons: <note place="margin">Why this truth is to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. 1. Becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are charged with it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it is the nature of all enemies to the truth and holineſſe of Chriſt, to charge the godly and innocent defenders thereof with hypocriſie and policy, that they do onely ſeek themſelves, that they drive on politick deſignes under religious pretences.</hi> That whereas it is the property of heretical perſons to broach new opinions, <hi>Alicujus temporalis commodi causâ,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the definition of an Heretick, theſe judging of others by themſelves, do think that even the faithfull ſervants of God, do only ſeek their own earthly greatneſſe and advancement. Hence we ſee even our Saviour himſelf ſo diligent to remove this charge from him, <hi>I ſeek not my own glory, but the glory of him, who ſent me,</hi> John 8. 50. So <hi>John</hi> 7. 18. where our Saviour giveth the character of a falſe teacher, of one that ſpeaketh of himſelf, that he ſeeketh his own glory: Thus the Popiſh party charge lies and calumnies upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, as if they had uſed all politick and crafty wayes to diſſeminate their Doctrines. Therefore <hi>Leſſius</hi> the Jeſuite, among his reaſons, why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion is not to be imbraced, maketh this one, <hi>That Religion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which uſeth lies and falſhoods to propagate it ſelf, cannot be of God;</hi> which he applieth to the Proteſtant Churches. But as for the <hi>Major,</hi> we grant it, as a ſure truth: True Religion is only advanced by truth and ſincerity; whereas errours being in themſelves lies, are increaſing by the father of lies. But then we ſay, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is notoriouſly guilty in this way; from them firſt came that expreſſion of <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> applied by ſome to indulgences. It is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that hath <hi>(Revel.</hi> 17. 5.) upon her forehead written <hi>Myſtery;</hi> ſhe is the harlot, that like <hi>Solomons,</hi> doth wipe her mouth, and ſpeak of vows, pretending Religion, when ſhe hath been acting her leudneſſe. But by how much the more the enemies of Gods Church, are apt to charge the guides therein with policy and deceitfulneſſe, the more are they to watch to their wayes, and to walk with all ſincerity. For theſe accuſations are believed by many. And withall there is a generation of Atheiſtical, politick men in the world, that hereby are hardened in their impiety, as if Religion were but a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick deviſe of men, and therefore matter not any further than their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:48709:225"/>
are ſerved thereby, <hi>Whoſe damnation ſleepeth not,</hi> if they do not awaken betimes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond Reaſon why this is to be attended, is, <hi>Becauſe all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Becauſe all profeſſours would be thought clear from it.</note> 
                  <hi>to any Religion in the world, they would all be thought to be ſincere.</hi> None will own and juſtifie hypocriſie and guile to be lawfull. Indeed the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites they go high this way, when they defend <hi>mental reſervations,</hi> and make <hi>equivocation, Prudens defenſio rei,</hi> as <hi>Valentia.</hi> Theſe are not onely deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and uſe <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> but alſo plead for it, yet at other times would be thought very free from all ſuch carnal policy, and way of lying. As <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in a Sermon of his, <hi>(Conc. 9. de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>probitate doct. Eccleſ.)</hi> inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt Proteſtants, whom he calleth <hi>Hereticks, Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>their Doctrine were true, yet ought they to confirme it with lies? Nonne ſatius eſſet millies obmuteſcere, quam ſemel mentiri? Were it not better ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to be a thouſand times ſilent, then once to lie? What is the worke of the Devil, if this be not?</hi> Thus a great Champion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, which you would think did all things in great candour and ingenuity: And yet in that very Sermon reporteth forged lies againſt eminent men, continuing the ſame bitterneſs in <hi>Conc.</hi> 10, 11, 12. as if his tongue were ſet on fire from hell. But there are two famous places in the Scripture, which may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirm us of the deceivable and falſe wayes in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. The firſt is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. where they are ſaid, <hi>To ſpeake lies in hypocriſie, forbidding to marry,</hi> &amp;c. who are therefore ſaid, <hi>To have ſeducing ſpirits,</hi> yea and a <hi>conſcience ſeared with an hot iron;</hi> that is, becauſe they can ſo abominably diſſemble both with God and man. The ſecond place is, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 9. where the coming of that wicked one is ſaid to be <hi>after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſignes, and lying wonders, in all deceiveable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Here you ſee, that fraud and impoſtures are (as it were) the true note of their falſe Church. But though this be ſo, yet they would waſh their Blackmoor skin, and charge that crime upon thoſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who departed from them. Seeing then that this couſening, deceiving way is charged mutually by all parties upon one another, with what integrity and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity doth it behove thoſe to walk, who are indeed the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt? But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The preaching of this truth is to take off thoſe prejudices that doe too cloſely adhere even to ſuch, who are come out of that ſpiritual Babylon.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. To take off prejudices from true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</note> There is a cauſleſſe and ſinfull ſuſpition in people, that if the faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours in Gods Church do indeavour a Reformation from the accuſtomed ſuperſtitions, or evil and prophane diſorders, that through length of time have taken full and quiet poſſeſſion; they preſently attribute this to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and corrupt ends; they will not believe that theſe things are undertaken from pure and holy ends; they will not be perſwaded, that the motive to theſe things, is pure reſpect to Gods glory: but that the Miniſters of God have their carnal and ſiniſter reſpects in all this, either to get dominion, or to advance themſelves in one way or other. Now although it may not be denied, but that in peruſing of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory; we may obſerve that carnal intereſt, and humane reſpects were eminently dominative in Church-affairs, yet God forbid that any ſhould be given up to ſuch a temptation, as to think that there is no truth or fidelity in any. When <hi>Lot</hi> did but courteouſly and civilly reprove the <hi>Sodomites</hi> for their high impieties; ſee how wickedly they interpret this, <hi>Geneſ. 19. 9. He will needs be a judge over us.</hi> They conſtrued his endeavour againſt ſinne to be nothing but uſurpation. Thus alſo <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices accounted all that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did, tyranny and pride, <hi>Numb. 16. 5. Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the Congregation is holy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore doe ye lift up your
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48709:226"/>
ſelves above the Congregation of the Lord.</hi> And we may ſee by many Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies that <hi>Paul</hi> maketh, the <hi>Galatians</hi> and other Churches could hardly be perſwaded of his ſincerity and love to them. If then thou ſhalt once ſatisfie thy ſelf with this, that thoſe Miniſters of God, who endeavour to bring a people out of their diſorders, and to make them conformable to Scripture-directions, dare not look to themſelves herein: yea they goe againſt themſelves, and ſhew no fleſhly wiſdome at all; but rather if they conſulted with that, they would let people goe quietly in the broad way to perdition, as they have done. If (I ſay) this be once believed by thee, it will make thee with all alacrity and chearfulneſſe to go along with them, and encourage them in their work. But it is the Devil that moveth upon that unruly ſea of thy heart; he putteth thee into many vexations and commotions, whereas if the Spirit of God ſhould rebuke both Satan and thy own corruptions, thou wouldſt with clamneſſe reflect upon thy ſelf, yea reprove thy ſelfe, ſaying, Why ſhould I be offended at thoſe wayes which are for the good of my ſoule, which make to the getting of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to the overcoming of thoſe former luſts I have been intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with, which would have done mee no good, but have deſtroyed my ſoul?</p>
               <p>Theſe things premiſed, let us inſtance in ſome principles of <hi>fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that men have uſed, and doe uſe in the matters of Religion. <note place="margin">Principles of fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 1. To defend errours from Scripture wreſted.</note> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is the <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> as it were of all heretical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>To cover their falſhoods with pretended Authority from the Scripture.</hi> Now this is meerly fleſhly wiſdome to regard the Scripture no further then by the words and phraſes thereof thou canſt protect thy errours. Not to go to the word of God, as that Rule by which thou wilt ſtand, or fall, to give up thy heart and ſoul, and all thy thoughts to be moulded and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by that; but having afore-hand ſwallowed down thy corrupt tenets, then to go to Scripture, to wreſt and compell it (as it were) to ſpeak for thee. There is a great deal of <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> in managing of falſe wayes, but it is never more hainous, yea and ſacrilegious, then when it doth thus prophanely and irreverently handle Scripture. If we expoſtulate with the <hi>Socinian,</hi> he will grant the Scripture words, he will tell you, he holdeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a God, that by Chriſts blood we have remiſſion of ſinnes: but then come to ask him, In what ſenſe Chriſt is a God, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we have remiſſion of ſinnes by Chriſts death? then the poiſon of the Viper doth break forth. So if we contend with the <hi>Pelagian, Arminian,</hi> and others, about the injury they doe to the Grace of Chriſt, they will tell you, they are for Chriſt, they doe owne all the Texts of Scripture that ſpeak of grace. But then ask, what they mean by grace? And how farre they extend the efficacy of grace? then their deceit will appear. So that it it is true of moſt Hereticks, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>They ſpeake the ſame words, but doe not thinke the ſame things.</hi> Let then all <hi>fleſhly wiſdom</hi> be abhorred, whereby we goe to the Scripture onely to apply the words thereof to our lies, and ſo would father them upon the Spirit of God; not that we love the purity and holineſſe of the Scriptures, but becauſe we cannot be received with any approbation, unleſſe we bring our authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, pretended at leaſt from that. Therefore it falleth out many times, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerveth, When ſuch erroneous perſons can no longer hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Scripture-words, that they directly fall to accuſe the Scripture, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deny it to be the word of God, or debaſing of it, as but a dead letter, that ſo their corrupt hearts may be more believed, than the Scripture it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:48709:226"/>
Secondly, A ſecond principle of <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> is, <hi>To hide and conceale thoſe monſtrous births we have brought forth, or elſe ſecretly and in a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. To hide our errours, or elſe ſecretly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect others with them.</note> 
                  <hi>manner to acquaint others with them, that ſo many weake perſons may be infected before thoſe who are able and skilfull had any opportunity to gain-ſay them.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome, <hi>Who ſhould pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily bring in damnable hereſies: Privily,</hi> becauſe as the thief hateth the light, ſeeing he onely comes to ſteale: ſo do thoſe who vent their falſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours delight in ſecreſie, becauſe the light will quickly manifeſt their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods. As it is with Moles, all the while they are under ground, you can hardly take them, but if once above ground, then they are preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: Thus all the while errours and falſhoods creep under ground, will not come to the light, they are hardly diſcovered and ſtopped: but when once found out, then they are eaſily overcome. Now all this is but <hi>fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome,</hi> to appear no where but in the dark, to be alwayes hiding our ſelves under ground. Therefore they are ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 6. To creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to houſes,</hi> as thieves do by night; they doe all things cloſely and ſecretly, not willing to be brought to the light: Whereas we have our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the clean contrary concerning himſelf, <hi>John 18. 20. I ſpake openly to the world, I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither the Jewes reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing.</hi> Thus the Miniſters of Chriſt imitate him in an open publick way. Not but that in times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, the Diſciples of Chriſt have had their private meetings, and have fled from the wrath of Magiſtrates, which the Apoſtle attributeth to the faith of the godly, not their fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37. Only when it was a caſe of confeſſion, and their duty publickly to give teſtimony to the truths of God, then no torments could make them decline it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt in order I ſhall now propound is, <hi>To advance thoſe men who have been of their way, by lies attributing glorious things to them, and as much disparaging and falſly accuſing all ſuch who have been in a contrary way of Religion to them.</hi> This hath been the ſubtil policy and ſtratagem in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For no Church in the world hath abounded more in <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> then ſhe hath done. How notoriouſly abſurd and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48709:227"/>
are they in relating many fooliſh miracles done by their Saints? Yea they attribute many wonderfull things to ſome as Saints, when there were never any ſuch perſons in the world, as many learned Writers hold there were never ſuch perſons as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>George,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and yet what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous miracles are reported of them? And truly to read the lives of their Popiſh Saints, would make a man nauſeate their Religion, they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſuch who did ſo much ſerve their affections, and drive on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: Which made <hi>Canus,</hi> even a Papiſt, complaine of it, though he ſaith he doth, <hi>Dolenter dicere magis quam contumelioſe, ſpeake it with grief rather than with reproach. The lives of Heathens</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>[Canus loc. Theolog. Lib. 11. cap. 6.] are written with more truth by Heatheniſh Writers, then of Saints by Catholicke Writers.</hi> Laertius <hi>hath more faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related the lives of the Philoſophers, and</hi> Suetonius <hi>the lives of the</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, <hi>then ours have done the lives of Saints.</hi> Which maketh him goe on, and ſay, <hi>That he who wrote that Booke, which is called</hi> Aurea Legenda, <hi>was a man</hi> Perrei oris, <hi>and</hi> Plumbei cordis: <hi>He that wrote the</hi> Golden Legend, <hi>was a man of an</hi> iron Fore-head, <hi>and a</hi> leaden-Heart. Now all this is nothing but <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> not to regard the truth: But onely what will make for advantage, whereas we may ſee wonderfull ſincerity in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in this very matter; They did uſe no <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> at all, but doe record their owne infirmities as well as miracles. Doth not the Evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt <hi>Matthew</hi> relate how he was a <hi>Publican?</hi> Is not <hi>Peter</hi>'s deniall of his Maſter, in all the aggravations of it recorded? Are not the ſtrifes of the Diſciples about primacy mentioned? Doe we not read of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> their ſharp contention? Did not <hi>Paul withſtand Peter to the face,</hi> becauſe he was worthy to be reproved? Certainly the want of <hi>fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and carnall policy in the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> doing all things with ſincerity and integrity, as well when it maketh againſt them as for them, doth plainly evidence, that they were of God. Chriſt doth not need the conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our imperfections. The more unworthy the inſtruments are, the more is his glory in bringing about his ends by them. Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> was not aſhamed to leave to the world a publick confeſſion of his youthfull vanities and follies. And <hi>Beza</hi> doth <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>expoſe himſelfe to ſhame</hi> upon that very word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 19. where ſhewing that in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> one <hi>Archilochus</hi> a Poet, for diſhoneſt verſes which he had made, he did <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore <hi>Beza</hi> did ſay of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, <hi>Isti homines invident mihi gratiam Dei. Theſe men envy me the grace of God.</hi> As <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> is ſeene thus in an hyperbolical admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men of our own way, not at all taking notice of their imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: ſo is it no leſſe manifeſt in the diſpraiſing, diſgraceing and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly traducing thoſe who are diſſentients from us. This is <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> to diſgrace and calumniate thoſe who are againſt us by forged lies. As the <hi>Heathens</hi> of old ſaid, <hi>The Christians worſhipped an Aſſes head, and that at their love-feaſts all wantonneſſe and uncleanneſſe were committed.</hi> It is <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>'s boaſt, <hi>That no Catholickes are found to praiſe the Doctrine or lives of Heretickes,</hi> which is it ſelfe falſe. For to omit many inſtances, <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſaith of <hi>Calvin,</hi> though he ſubjoyneth enough to marre all, <hi>That he is an Interpreter for the letter of the Scripture,</hi> Ita diligens, ita elegans, ita ſuavis, <hi>&amp;c. (In Antid. Evang. in Praefat.) So diligent, ſo
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48709:227"/>
elegant, ſo ſweet that many Papiſts did reade him. Yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have heard many wiſh that thoſe things which are disputed in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries againſt the Church, and its faith, were taken out, and then they would be very greatly uſefull.</hi> But if it were true, that no Papiſts did praiſe the Proteſtants; this is not for their honour, but reproach; it being a duty to acknowledge the gifts and abilities that are in men, though we abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their errours and vices. So that it is wholly <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> in them thus to ſuppreſſe the excellency of thoſe who are againſt them. Yea, if they ſtayed here, it were pardonable; but they doe moſt prodigiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vent, and publiſh horrible lies about <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as if they had beene monſters of men for their impieties. But all this is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the Devil, and God hath turned all their curſing into bleſſing.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>It is fleſhly wiſdome to maintaine any ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. To maintain falſe doctrines that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety.</note> 
                  <hi>and deceitfull Doctrines, as doe maintaine falſhood and deceit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as much as lieth in them, overthrow all humane ſocieties.</hi> The <hi>Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianiſts</hi> of old did maintaine, <hi>That it was lawfull to lie, and ſweare, and ſay any thing, ſo that they kept the heart pure.</hi> And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (I meane the Jeſuited ones) they come neare them; for they doe profeſſedly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for the lawfullneſſe of <hi>Equivocation</hi> and <hi>Mental Reſervation;</hi> yea they call it prudence. And as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> of old, who privately to their Diſciples, did plainly declare their opinions, but in publick ſpake craftily and ambiguouſly, thereby to deceive others, as if they were Orthodox, alledging Chriſts example, who to the multitude ſpake in Parables, but opened them plainly to his Diſciples: ſo would theſe faſten upon Chriſt, and holy men recorded in Scripture, inſtances of equivocation. But the Scripture commands us, <hi>To lay aſide lying, ſpeaking every man the truth to his neighbour,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 25. And this is ſubjoyned as a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of putting on the new man. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrote much againſt this way of lying. And certainly ſeeing that words are appointed to ſignifie our mind to another; if we pervert them to the contrary end to deceive them, we doe overthrow the foundation of ſpiritual and civil ſocieties. It is one thing indeed not to reveale all the truth, when not required, or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this may ſometimes be done; but to deny the truth, or equivocate, this doth no wayes become thoſe, who with ſincerity, and not with <hi>fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> are to propagate the Goſpel. If you ſay, for all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath uſed ſuch carnal policy, yet ſhe continueth in her externall proſperity, ſhe is not blaſted and croſſed in her deſignes: and therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would take advantages of the Proteſtants by this, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Church of Rome be ſo vile and impure as you ſay ſhe is; if ſhe uſe! all thoſe unlawfull and ungodly wayes to keep up her glory, then it's the greater argument, that her conſtitution is of God, that all her craft and wickedneſſe hath not yet ruined her.</hi> But to this doubt it is eaſily anſwered, That by the Scripture we know it is foretold, that he muſt prevaile for a long time in the Church: and therefore their ſucceſſe, notwithſtanding all their cruelty and craft, is not to be any ſtumbling block to ſuch who believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
               <p>The third inſtance of <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> to propagate Religion by, is, <hi>To</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. To indulge men in ſin, and to increaſe Diſciples.</note> 
                  <hi>indulge men in their luſts and ſinnes, that ſo the party which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, may be the more numerous.</hi> This is <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> in an high degree of impiety; and yet in this alſo the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath beene notorious, when other Churches have by their good Diſcipline caſt out ſome offenders for ſcandalous impieties; They have appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that caſe and ſhe craftily laying hold
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48709:228"/>
on the opportunity, hoping thereby to eſtabliſh her Supremacy, would like <hi>Abſolom</hi> ſay to every one that came, that his cauſe was good; and by this policy in indulging and encouraging ſuch licentious offenders, whom other Churches would not endure as members: At laſt with other politick devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhe arrived to that amplitude of power, ſhe now glorieth in. We might inſtance in other ſubtil forgeries, as the corrupting or denying ſome Canons made in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> thereby to tranſlate the chief Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archſhip to her ſelf; a famous cheat, and diſcovered moſt palpably to the ſhame of the <hi>Romane</hi> party, of which there is much in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours;</hi> as alſo the pretence of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> donation, a forged he like the reſt. This I ſhall inſiſt upon, as greatly conſiderable, <hi>The indulging of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in prophaneneſſe,</hi> as alſo <hi>in horrible ignorance,</hi> that ſo they may rule without controll. And how well were it if this <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> were inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>Romane</hi> Conclave? Are there not too many in the Proteſtant Churches, that out of a deſire either to pleaſe men, or increaſe their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages promote a promiſcuous admiſſion of all to the Lords Table, making no difference betweene the clean and unclean. This I confeſſe is the way to be applauded by the moſt: This is that which will give beſt content to all: This is accounted wiſdome and moderation; but <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her children;</hi> and the holy inſtitution of Chriſts, will be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who worſhip God in Spirit and truth: But this <hi>fleſhly wiſoome</hi> whereby we pleaſe all, and indulge men in their luſts, is ſeldome ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but fire will come out of the Bramble, when it doth not out of the Fig-tree to conſume: I meane even prophane and wicked ſpirits are many times ſtirred up by God to oppoſe ſuch corrupt Teachers, when the godly meddle not at all. For God doth many times make uſe of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one ungodly man, to torment another. Yea <hi>Luther</hi>'s firſt ſtirrings againſt the abuſes of Popery, were not ſo pure and ſincere, as afterwards when the light and grace of God came more upon him. It is therefore a great duty incumbent upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to walk ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Chriſts rule in their paſtoral exerciſes, avoiding this <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> which though it may ſeeme ſometimes to prevent a miſchiefe, yet as it did to <hi>David,</hi> doth afterwards plunge in a greater calamity. And indeed going to carnal policy in Church-adminiſtrations, is but like going to witches and wizards, forſaking Gods way, which never bringeth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then is carnal wiſdome uſed to propagate Religion, <hi>When by it we propound carnal and ſelfiſh ends to our ſelves, not the glory of God, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound fleſhly ends.</note> 
                  <hi>advancing the power and purity of his Ordinances.</hi> This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> doth principally diſclaim, <hi>I ſeek not you but yours,</hi> ſaith he in this Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. And that they might be perſwaded hereof, he would take no maintenance of them, but made uſe of other Churches, that he might ſpare them; yea ſometimes working with his own hands. How farre this is imitable by the Miniſters of the Goſpel now, as many do upbraid them with this example of <hi>Paul,</hi> will be clearly and fully evidenced (God aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in its time) for we ſhall meet with this part of <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and inſiſted on by him in this Epiſtle. But it is worth the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Paul</hi> by no way he took, could eſcape the ſlander of a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeker. For if in that caſe he had burdened the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the falſe Apoſtles would have calumniated him, as uſing a cloak of covetouſneſs, and ſeeking himſelf: But now becauſe he will not do ſo, ſee how this is interpreted as a carnal deſigne alſo; for ſo he bringeth in their objection, <hi>verſ. 16, Be it ſo, I did not burden you, but being crafty, I tooke you with guile.</hi> This was ſuggeſted againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> they made this conſtruction of
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48709:228"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s not burdening them, that he did this out of craft, that they ſhould think themſelves the more ingaged unto him; and ſo by this means, he get the more dominion over them. Thus what ſhall <hi>Paul</hi> do, if he doth not take mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it is his craft, and if he doth, it is his craft? By this inſtance we ſee, how much we are to avoid all <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> for do what we will, it ſhall be charged upon us. Only when we have this ſincerity of conſcience within to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport us, this will be a means to make us bear the ſlanders of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with greater alacrity. Now as we ſaid, then we may certainly conclude, we are guided by <hi>fleſhly wiſdome;</hi> when our aimes in our miniſterial way is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory, and applauſe, which was the poiſon of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> duties; or earthly wealth and external pomp; which motives do eaſily creep in, unleſſe grace be the porter to keep the door of the ſoul. We ſee even the Diſciples themſelves, and that twice contending about ſuperiority; and once this was done when our Saviour was fore-telling them of his ſad ſufferings, and how they ſhould be ſcattered. And truly this ſhould much prevail with us to walk by ſincere rules, becauſe nothing doth more awe peoples hearts, nothing doth more erect a throne of fear and reverence in mens hearts, ſo much as integrity. Even <hi>Herod</hi> did fear <hi>John,</hi> becauſe he was a juſt man; he ſaw he was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by carnal pinciples, and that made <hi>Herod</hi> reverence him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. And thus it was with Chriſt himſelf alſo, this made the people ſo greatly flock after him, becauſe the hypocriſe and ſelf-ſeeking of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> began to be made clear to them. And thus the integrity of our Reformers was precious: whereas the luxury, pride and ambition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy began to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. Yea before <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, the Church generally groaned under them, which made <hi>Berengarius</hi> call them <hi>Romanos Pompifices,</hi> and <hi>Pulpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> as regarding their pompe and belly more than their miniſterial duty.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, (For the differences I promiſed to ſpeak to between <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>heavenly wiſdome,</hi> as alſo civil prudence, may be conſidered in the next particular.) <hi>Fleſhly wiſdome</hi> is ſeen, <hi>In glorying and boaſting of humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and philoſophical demonſtrations.</hi> This ſome make to be a great part of, if not the only ſenſe of <hi>fleſhly wiſdome.</hi> And certainly this is that which <hi>Paul</hi> renounceth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 3, 4. the end whereof was, that their faith might not ſtand in the wiſdome of men, but the power of God. And therefore the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> are commended, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 13. That they received the Gospel, not as the word of men, but as of God, which effectually worketh in thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> That there may be no uſe made of humane learning, much leſſe that it is not lawfull to improve the gifts and abilities of learned men in our Miniſtry, I think is ſcarcely in an abſolute ſenſe denied by any orthodox. But then they give this Caution, That ſuch things muſt not be done out of oſtentation, but edification, and conviction; neither muſt we ſo preach that our auditors ſhould be more affected with the oratory or learning, than the matter, the gifts and parts of a Miniſter, more than the holy truths which are delivered for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and converſion. And therefore as we the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to take heed of all fleſhly wiſdome, eſpecially this latter, which is ſo ſubtil a thief, ready to ſteal away our treaſure: So ought you the hearers to take heed of all fleſhly wiſdome. For it is this only maketh you go away unconverted, unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, unreformed, your conſcience, your mind condemns you for it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fleſhly wiſdome will not let you obey. As (I ſay) we are to take heed of this univerſally; ſo eſpecially that you do not regard the parts, learning and oratory of a Miniſter more than holy matter. You muſt hear from a ſincere heart, you muſt come to our Miniſtry with godly ſimplicity, as well as we are to preach ſo; and it is hard to ſay, whether is more difficult, to preach without <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> or hear without it. Do you deſire to know nothing, but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

Do ye not mind more what may tickle your ear, pleaſe your fancy, then what may wound your heart? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> even to his Lecture of moral Philoſophy, doth require one who is purged from his luſts. How much rather is the word of God to be received with a pure and mortified heart? Oh this <hi>fleſnly wiſdome</hi> will prove curſed folly at laſt! In the flames of hell thou wilt cry out of this, Oh wretch that I was, I thought to be wiſe for my ſelf, and how unſpeakably am I undone thereby!</p>

               <p>THe third particular, which qualifieth the Apoſtles converſation in this world, cometh in order to be treated on, which is ſet down <hi>Oppoſitely, But by the grace of God.</hi> This is added; partly to exclude all pride and preſumption in himſelf. For having declared his integrity, leſt it might be thought, that though he did not confide in carnal wiſdome, yet he might in his own integrity; he addeth, <hi>The grace of God;</hi> ſhewing thereby, that he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in that alone. And then partly it is ſpoken, in oppoſition to <hi>fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> For ſeeing it might be demanded, If <hi>Paul</hi> did not uſe the wiſdome of the world, How could it come about, that he ſhould have ſuch ſucceſs in his preaching, that the Goſpel ſhould have ſuch a full and glorious courſe by his Miniſtry? He reſolveth it into the <hi>grace of God,</hi> that did go along with him: it was neither his gifts, or his graces, but the power and grace of God, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and protecting of him, in his miniſterial imployment. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Acts 14. 26. are by the brethren recommended to the <hi>grace of God</hi> for the work, which they fulfilled. So that whereas the word <hi>Grace</hi> in the New Teſtament, hath ſeveral ſignifications; the principal whereof is the <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>meer mercy of God without us.</hi> The leſſe principal, is the <hi>Effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> and the Effects of this Grace, are either of ſanctification, or adminiſtration and ſervice. We may comprehend all theſe in the word <hi>[Grace;]</hi> but eſpecially the latter, the effects of grace; and of thoſe effects, chiefly thoſe miniſterial gifts, with the ſucceſſe thereof, that <hi>Paul</hi> was enriched with. <hi>What is this grace of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome? It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the wiſdome and power God bestowed upon him, whereby through miracles and other wayes, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that coming without humane learning, and oratory of the world, he
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:48709:229"/>
did overcome the greateſt Philoſophers and Rhetoricians, whom the world did admire.</hi> This was the grace of God upon <hi>Paul,</hi> which he alſo mentioneth as the original of all the fruit of his labours, not attributing any thing to himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now although by grace is meant principally the grace called, <hi>Gratiis da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> common miniſterial gifts and favours of God, yet becauſe it is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>fleſhly wiſdome</hi> and carnal policy. There is alſo neceſſarily contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>heavenly wiſdome,</hi> whereby <hi>Paul</hi> did avoid all ſenſual and deceitfull wayes, walking cloſely according to the Word, the fountain of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wiſdome. For as the Scriptures are a farre ſurer Rule, even to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Governours and Magiſtrates, then <hi>Tacitus, Machiavel,</hi> or others, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by humane, worldly wiſe men, even in their civil adminiſtrations: So much more is it a ſure Starre for all the ſpiritual Officers of the Church to manage their affaires by, if they do look for ſucceſſe. From the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture both Magiſtrates and Miniſters may learne wiſdome for their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive adminiſtrations. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore, what ever it be that goeth on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly in his miniſterial worke, doth not attribute it either to his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, much leſſe to any humane policy, which he renounceth, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the grace of God aſſiſting of him, and going conſtantly along with him. Obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is the property of thoſe who are godly to take nothing to themſelves,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The godly aſcribe all to the grace of God.</note> 
                  <hi>but to give all to the grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee here, though <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo eminent for godlineſſe, and ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for gifts, yet he maketh the <hi>grace of God</hi> to be alone the ſole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of all ſpiritual ſucceſſe. This ſubject the Apoſtle doth very willingly enlarge himſelf upon, whereſoever he hath occaſion: Hence in the fore-mentioned place, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. 10. he ſaith, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am. The grace of God</hi> made him an holy man; The <hi>grace of God</hi> made him an eminent Apoſtle; he had nothing as a private Chriſtian, or as an Officer, but by the <hi>grace of God;</hi> and becauſe many may have grace in a common way beſtowed upon them, that yet abuſe it, as <hi>Judas;</hi> he addeth, <hi>This grace was not in vain.</hi> Yet leſt it ſhould be thought that it was his improvement of the grace beſtowed, that made it ſo effectual, he preſently correcteth his expreſſion, <hi>Yet not I, but the grace of God,</hi> which was <hi>with me.</hi> As it is not the pen, but the Writer that is a cauſe of fair Characters.</p>
               <p>Let us diſcover this Doctrine. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſee the <hi>Apoſtle rejoycing in the ſincerity of his heart, and yet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. A man may take comfort in his own holineſſe, and yet truſt only in Gods grace.</note> 
                  <hi>acknowledging all to the grace of God, ſo that theſe two may well ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take comfort from our holineſſe, yet to put our truſt in nothing but the grace of God.</hi> It is true, this is a very hard leſſon to performe, there is required much skill and prudence herein; for we are apt to runne into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames: Either through unbelief and peeviſhneſſe, we nouriſh doubts and perplexing thoughts in our ſelves, not taking notice of the grace of God in us: Or elſe, if we doe behold it, and rejoyce in it, we are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a ſecret manner lifted up, and confident thereby. But we ſee by the Apoſtles practice, both are conſiſtent together: So that the people of God are diligently to labour after this heavenly frame of heart. To be in doubts and fears about thy condition, is to live in the jaws of hell, and to be preſuming or carnally confident of thy graces, is the next door to a ſad and miſerable downfall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:48709:230"/>
Secondly, <hi>It is not enough to acknowledge the grace of God in the general, but ſo to ſet up grace as to give all to it.</hi> The Apoſtle maketh an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <note place="margin">2. All is to be given unto grace.</note> oppoſition between <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>workes,</hi> Rom. 11. 6. there cannot be a reconciling of grace and workes together. This hath been often attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but as unhappily as the building up the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> again. The <hi>Pelagian, Arminian,</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Papiſt,</hi> all theſe doe acknowledge <hi>grace;</hi> but when we come to the root of the matter, it's nothing at laſt, but the <hi>free-will and workes of a man.</hi> It is his good uſe of grace, that doth determine and make all things effectual, not grace it ſelf: And this is the rather to be noted, becauſe <hi>Stapleton</hi> would antidote againſt <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>'s poiſon, as he ſpeaketh from this Text. For whereas <hi>Calvin</hi> taking notice of the Apoſtles glorying, in the <hi>teſtimony of his conſcience</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his ſincerity, doth ſhew, that <hi>Paul</hi> hereby doth not oppoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Let him that glorieth glory in the Lord,</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> giveth all to the <hi>grace of God,</hi> and reſteth alone upon that. From this, <hi>Stapleton</hi> would excuſe the Papiſts alſo, becauſe they acknowledge all good workes to come from <hi>grace:</hi> Their merits are founded onely upon Chriſts merits. Even as it doth not derogate from the power of God, that he uſeth ſecond cauſes in natural things, becauſe they are ſubordinate to him, both in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and operation; but it doth illuſtrate as his bounty, ſo his power the more to make other things powerfull: Thus ſaith he, it is not injurious to the grace and merits of Chriſt, if we attribute merit to our workes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this cometh onely from Chriſt; but it argueth his fullneſſe and rich grace the more, that communicateth of it to us. So that (ſaith he) to put truſt in the workes of grace, as the proxim and immediate cauſe, but in the grace of God, as the chiefe and univerſal cauſe, is no derogation to the honour and glory of Chriſt. But that of the Apoſtle muſt be alwayes remembred, <hi>If of grace, then not of workes, otherwiſe grace is no more grace.</hi> It is not <hi>grace,</hi> unleſſe it be <hi>grace every way:</hi> And therefore to make our workes the ſecond cauſes to truſt in, though it be not ſo high a wickedneſſe as to exclude Chriſt throughly, yet it doth in part, and therefore as in the matter of worſhip, we admit of no primary and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary worſhip, no more than a primary and ſecondary God: So it is in matter of truſting, we muſt depend only upon Chriſt, not but that holineſſe and godly works are neceſſarily required, but not as cauſes under any ſubtil diſtinctions whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things premiſed, let us now conſider, <hi>What is that grace which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What is that grace the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 1. That grace whereby he was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
                  <hi>the Apoſtle doth here exalt againſt all fleſhly wiſdome.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, As the ground-work of all, there is to be underſtood, <hi>That grace of God, whereby he was called out of that phariſaical eſtate, and condition of enmity againſt Chriſt, to be a faithfull and ready ſervant to him.</hi> This wonderfull grace of God to him, doth often melt the heart of <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſpeaketh of it with aggravating particulars, as much as may be. Thus <hi>Galat. 1, 15. When it pleaſed God, who called me by his grace, to reveale his Sonne in me,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15, 16. he acknowledged himſelf an inſtance, <hi>(Becauſe the chiefeſt of ſinners,) of the long-ſuffering of Chriſt.</hi> In <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion there were no preparations, no merits of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, there was no docible and fitted diſpoſitions: Inſomuch that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to Gods grace do acknowledge <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion to be an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing. In the midſt of his perſecuting ſury, when God might have ſtruck him dead with thunder and lightnings from Heaven, and ſo ſend him quick (as it were) to Hell; God did viſit him with his grace, and give him another heart, to his own amazement, and of all thoſe who heard of it. So if you look upon <hi>Paul</hi> in a ſingle capacity, as a private perſon in the whole courſe of his life, he giveth all to the grace of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:48709:230"/>
Secondly, <hi>The grace of God,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> doth alſo greatly exalt, is, <hi>In the ſetting of him apart to be an Apoſtle, and an eminent Officer in the Church of God.</hi> This crooked and rough timber, that was onely fit for the fire, God doth not onely poliſh and ſmooth by grace, but advanceth it to be an eminent part in the building; notwithſtanding all <hi>Paul</hi>'s former unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, God doth not onely by his grace call him, but maketh him an honourable veſſel in his houſe. This our Apoſtle doth likewiſe with great enlargement, in many places take great notice of. See how emphatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is he affected with this grace of God towards him, <hi>Epheſians 3. 7, 8. Whereof I was made a Miniſter according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me,—unto me, who am leſſe than the leaſt of all Saints, is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles, the unſearchable riches of Chriſt.</hi> Doe not theſe words proclaime how greatly his heart is affected with the <hi>grace of God,</hi> in ſetting him apart to be an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in his Church, and to proclaim the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> Thus the grace of Converſion, and the grace of Apoſtleſhip, are a two-fold obligation upon <hi>Paul,</hi> for ever to keep him humble, and lowly in his own eyes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The grace of God exalted by <hi>Paul,</hi> is ſeen, <hi>In the inabling of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. That grace whereby he was made an Apoſtle.</note> 
                  <hi>him in his miniſterial worke, and going along with him in an effectual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> That whereas he had ſo many adverſaries, the falſe Apoſtles, who gloried in humane wiſdome, and all external enticements of the fleſh of man; yet for all that, that his ſeeming folly ſhould conquer their tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſdome, that his contemptibleneſſe ſhould ſurmount their eminency; This argued that it was not <hi>Paul,</hi> but the <hi>grace of God</hi> with him, that was thus effectuall. Even as it was not little <hi>David</hi> in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but in the name of the Lord, that did deſtroy that vaunting <hi>Goliah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as there were many choice ingredients that did make up that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">3. That grace whereby he was enabled and proſpered in his Miniſtry</note> ointment, which was to be poured on the head of the Highprieſt: So there are alſo many choice and gracious qualifications, with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants thereof, required in thoſe who are Paſtours over people, eſpecially in the Apoſtles, who were Paſtours over Paſtours, as well as peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, It was the gracious worke of God, <hi>To make</hi> Paul <hi>to be ſincere,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">As, 1. It was the grace of God that made <hi>Paul</hi> ſincere.</note> 
                  <hi>and to walke in all plainneſſe and integrity of heart,</hi> whereas we ſee many in the broaching of their falſe wayes, are filled with great deceit and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty. The Apoſtle chargeth upon ſuch, who deliver falſe Doctrines, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 4. 14.

I ſpeake thus when I am in the Schooles, but to tell you a ſecret, I thinke otherwiſe.</hi> It was alſo a boaſt of another <hi>(Fredericus Staphylus) That he had ſo many yeares beene a profeſſour of Divinity in the Schooles, and yet no hearer was able to tell what judgement he was of.</hi> (Gerhardi <hi>Cathol. Confeſſio lib. 1. par. 2. cap.</hi> 19.) Now this craft and diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the old Dragon and his ſeed, is no wonder; but the Miniſters of Chriſt, as they believe with their heart, ſo they make confeſſion with their mouths, and dare not but reveale the whole counſel of God. It was horrible impudence in <hi>Melanthus</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> who having got a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48709:231"/>
by fraud and deceit, did in honour thereof, as if it were pleaſing to their gods, appoint Feſtivals, calling them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as much as <hi>couſtning</hi> and <hi>deceiving,</hi> inculcating that of the Poet, <hi>Dolus an virtus, quis in hoſte requirat.</hi> (Capel. <hi>Hiſtor. An. Mund.</hi> 2872.) Certainly the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and many other Hereticks have gone by no better Rule, counting gaine godlineſſe, counting lying and diſſembling godlineſſe, when they conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it made for their end. As if they were of that Kings mind <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Hystaspes,</hi> that to lie and ſpeake truth, were all one: For he that ſpake truth did ſo to obtain his deſires, and ſo he that lied did no more; and therefore both truth and a lie were all one. <hi>(Vide Laurent. Vul. Ji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. cap. 1. pag.</hi> 30.) But oh how abominable is this, and contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt! The grace of God in ſuch who are his faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, maketh them not to turn into ſuch falſe and crooked wayes, though the preaching of the truths of Chriſt bringeth much hatred and oppoſition, though they know they are unwelcome and deſpiſed, and that for their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meſſage ſake, yet they conſult not with <hi>fleſhly wiſdome,</hi> but doe the work of God zealouſly and with much faithfulneſſe. And truly the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God are much to pray for this grace of God upon them, that they may be above all humane feats, all ſinfull compliances, and be afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that they ſhould ſinne, and not preach the Goſpel with that bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as they ought to do. That great commendation which the ſpies gave Chriſt, upon a wicked deſigne, is to be endeavoured after by every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter of Chriſt, <hi>Luke 20. 20. Maſter, we know that thou ſayeſt and teacheſt rightly, neither accepteſt thou the perſon of any, but teacheſt the way of God truly.</hi> So that you ſee this ſincerity in the Miniſters of God, is the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial effect of Gods grace towards them.</p>
               <p>And therefore let us make an <hi>Uſe of Admonition to all ſuch as deſire to ſerve God in the way of the Ministry, that above all things they would pray to God for this grace.</hi> To have thy miniſterial converſation with much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning, with great applauſe and glory in the world, is nothing ſo advantagious as this <hi>integrity of ſpirit.</hi> This is above parts, above gifts, above books, and all learning. It is ſaid of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Act. 11. 24. <hi>He was a good man; full of the holy Ghoſt, and of faith, and much people was added to the Lord:</hi> This followed as a bleſſed effect upon the former.

               </epigraph>
               <p>WE are enumerating the particulars of that grace, which the Apoſtle doth eſpecially acknowledge in his miniſterial courſe. We proceed therefore, and</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The faithfulneſſe of</hi> Paul <hi>to his Apoſtolical truſt, fixing his heart</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What were thoſe graces which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in his Miniſtry 1. Faithfulneſs</note> 
                  <hi>upon that, and uſing no other meanes, then what are proportionable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to ſuch a noble end, was wholly of the grace of God towards him. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Stewards, that they be found faithfull,</hi> ſaith this Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. and with this grace God had honoured him. Inſomuch that we do not find in <hi>Paul</hi> any halting, any carnal compliance, which might contradict the holy end of his Apoſtolical Office. Thoſe are two noble expreſſions, 2 <hi>Corinth. 10. 8. Our authority the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> The other is, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 8. For we can doe nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi> In theſe Texts we have expreſſed the end of all miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power, it is for <hi>edification:</hi> And therefore if any through the Word preached be more hardened in their ſinnes, and made more obdurate in their evil wayes, this is beſides the intention of the Word. As when the Sunne blindeth a mans eyes through the dazelling thereof, this is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; the proper and natural effect, being to illuminate, all ſpiritual autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is for <hi>edification.</hi> And in the other Text, you have the power of grace upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s heart, ſo affecting of him, that he cannot do any thing <hi>againſt the truth.</hi> Neither doctrinally or practically would he indulge to any evil way; but thereby the end of his Miniſtry ſhould be fruſtrated. Now this is a ſpecial work of Gods grace ſo to ſanctifie, and keep tender our hearts, that we take heed of every thing that may obſtruct the happy courſe of the Goſpel: Whereas the Jeſuitical party will wander out into many by and extravagant wayes, to accompliſh their deſignes. <hi>Janſenius</hi> a learned Papiſt <hi>(Janſen. Sanctus Auguſtinus liber proaemialis, pag.</hi> 9.) ſpeaketh of one man, who not daring to do ſomething out of favour to another, which he knew was contrary to the principles of morality; neither affirmed by any Authours; as probable, had this anſwer from a Jeſuited Doctor, <hi>Aude, &amp; nos efficiemus probabile, Be bold to do it and we will make it probable.</hi> Here we ſee, their power is many times againſt the truth. But <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo kept by the grace of God, that not only deliberately he did not any thing which might retard the progreſſe of the Goſpel; but alſo nor ſo much as by infirmity,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:48709:232"/>
or any ſudden ſurprizal, as we ſee <hi>Peter</hi> did, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> did withſtand him to the face. This therefore is a bleſſed worke of Gods grace, when a Miniſter is kept ſo faithfully to the end of his Office, that neither in life or doctrine, will he doe any thing, that may be contrary to it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The grace of God extended itſelf mercifully to <hi>Paul, In that he was kept low and humble under all thoſe ſignal favours and prerogatives that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Humility.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath beſtowed upoh him.</hi> Was not every thing in <hi>Paal</hi> almoſt extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and miraculous, and yet who is kept lower in his own eyes, who is more emptied of himſelf, looking upon what he had been, more than what he was? So that it was of Gods grace to <hi>Paul,</hi> to make him acknowledge Gods grace not to truſt in himſelf. And thus it is alwayes in the Church of God; one ſpecial work of Gods grace, is to make us ſenſible of it, to give all to it, to goe out of our ſelves: and thus Gods fulneſſe is moſt ſeene in our emptineſſe. We ſee the <hi>Jewes</hi> went about wholly to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe. The <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophers, who did ſo admire vertue, were thereby advancers of themſelves: They looked upon virtue as their own work, that they were not beholding to God for it. Therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> maketh this the cauſe and foundation of all happineſſe, <hi>Fidere ſibiipſi, to truſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> though Chriſtian, yet his Doctrine driveth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſelf-advancement. So that though he would acknowledge the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that prayer, <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes</hi> (yet ſo as when we had ſinned, otherwiſe they pleaded perfection, and that a man might be without ſinne) yet for the enſuing Petition, <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> &amp;c. They would not underſtand it of ſpiritual temptations and occaſions to ſinne, as if we needed to pray to God for grace to prevent future ſinnes, our own will and ſtrength was ſufficient for that; but of external miſeries, ſuch as not to fall off an horſe, or to be killed by a thiefe: Theſe were the temptations onely we prayed againſt in this Petition. But where the grace of God is effectually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there it maketh a man apprehenſive of the neceſſity of it; and that to every action all the day long: and truly this is from God; when the Miniſter of the Goſpel ſhall go out of all parts, learning and ſtudies whatſoever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it's the grace of God alone that inableth him in his work: happily this would make the preſence of God more powerfull with us, if we did own his grace more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The grace of God with <hi>Paul</hi> in his miniſterial imployment, was, <note place="margin">3. Guidance and direction in his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> 
                  <hi>The directing of him in meditations, and guiding of him to ſuch thoughts and words as might moſt prevaile upon thoſe that heare him.</hi> For this we muſt know, that where Gods preſence is with a Miniſter, there he is directed to preach on ſuch ſubject matter, rather than other which God will bleſſe to a moſt happy and effectual iſſue. This made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay excellently, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 6. Not that we are ſufficient to think any thing of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God, who hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament.</hi> Here you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that we are not able to think one thought in our miniſterial way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for the edification of others without the grace of God. As in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we know not what to pray, or how to pray, without the Spirit of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling: So neither in preaching, we know not what to preach, or how to preach, unleſſe the Lord guide us. That is obſervable, <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 9, 10. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the preacher was wiſe, he taught the people knowledge, he gave good heed, and ſought out, and ſet in order many proverbs. The preacher ſought to find out acceptable words.</hi> By this we ſee, that there is ſpecial wiſdome to ſearch out fit matter and fit words, which cannot be obtained without God the fountain of wiſdome. So that herein the Miniſter of God is to exerciſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf daily in prayer to God, that he would teach him how to preach, and what
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:48709:232"/>
to preach, that he may not ſow chaff in ſtead of wheat, and cockles in ſtead of barley, that he may be ſo directed, as to pitch upon thoſe arguments, thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which will be moſt effectually working upon the ſouls of thoſe that do hear.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The grace of God was wonderfully manifeſt in <hi>Paul., By the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 His pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, zeal and courage.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſelf-denial, patience, zeal, and courage which was in him, while ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing his worke.</hi> Indeed <hi>Paul</hi> is like a pleaſant and choice Garden, wherein are ſo many precious flowers, that we know not which to pluck firſt. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo eminently beſpangled with all the graces of Gods Spirit, that we know not which to commend firſt. His <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> was admirable, when he complained, <hi>All ſought their own, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This argued how much he did abhorre ſuch courſes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. when he was ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to bring off deluded ſouls from the falſe Apoſtles who reigned over them. It was not his honour or glory that he looked at, if ſo be they would own Chriſt and his wayes in truth; let him be rejected, he mattered it not. This he plainly profeſſeth, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 7. I pray God ye do no evil, not that we ſhould be approved, but that you ſhould do that which is honeſt, though we be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as reprobates.</hi> It is plain therefore that it was their good, their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glory, not his own that he aimed at. His patience alſo was no leſſe remarkable, when he could quietly go through all the reproaches and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that the falſe Apoſtles did charge upon him, eſpecially his <hi>patience</hi> was even miraculous in thoſe ſufferings he was exerciſed with, for the Goſpels ſake. He that informed others, they had need of <hi>patience;</hi> how much more had he, being put to ſo many combates as he was? Yet under all this he fainted not, he forſook not Chriſt, and his cauſe; yea he rejoyced in his ſufferings, and looked upon them as ſo many marks of honour. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. you have a long Catalogue of the manifold bitter trials he was put upon; yet he was gold in this fire, he was wheat in this winnowing; he doth not complain of the cauſe of Chriſt he had eſpouſed, as <hi>Zipporah</hi> to <hi>Moſes, Thou art a bloody husband;</hi> yea in all theſe things, <hi>He is more than a conquerour,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37. For the greateſt Conquerours do for the moſt part receive ſome loſſe; but theſe tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſo farre from making him a loſer, that he was thereby a gainer. The grace of God was wonderfully in <hi>Paul,</hi> to make him ſo zealous for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt as he was; he learned of Chriſt himſelf to have the zeal of the Lords houſe to eat him up, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 29. Who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> There was nothing in the Church of God that fell out, which might be a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to any believer, which might any wayes tend to make ſuch an one fall; but his heart was affected therein, as if it had been his own cauſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fore-mentioned Chapter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 28. he acknowledgeth the care of all the Churches to be upon him; and this made him ſo compaſſionately ſympathizing with every member thereof. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> is like a ſpiritual <hi>Atlas,</hi> bearing up the Churches of God; not that he owneth himſelf in this, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to acknowledge the grace of God thereby to him. Now this zeal did neceſſarily imply publick affections, whereby <hi>Paul</hi> was inlarged in his ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the glory of God, and the good of others; which heavenly conſtitution doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe the grace of God: Man naturally making himſelf the utmoſt end of all his actions: and his own ſelf-love, like <hi>Phaeaoh</hi>'s lean kine, doth devour and ſwallow up all that is before it. Is not that paſſage of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick affection matter of amazement? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 2, 3. where he profeſſeth his great heavineſs, and continual ſorrow of heart for the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> Yea this did ſo farre poſſeſſe him, that he ſaith, <hi>I could wiſh my ſelf acourſed from Chriſt for their ſake.</hi> Such an high expreſſion, that it hath troubled Interprete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, how to explain it, and make it lawfull; as if in publick affections, as well as private, that were true, <hi>Difficile eſt amare &amp; ſapere,</hi> It is hard to love, and to be wiſe
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:48709:233"/>
alſo. Now this is a bleſſed effect of Gods grace upon the hearts of thoſe who preach the Goſpel, when they <hi>preferre Jeruſalem above all their joy;</hi> when they preach not to live upon the Goſpel, and to be maintained by the Goſpel, but rather uſe theſe, as ſteps whereby they may aſcend higher. That as the body is for the ſoul, not the ſoul for the body; ſo they make perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations for the publick, not publick for the perſonal. Laſtly, That I may not weary you out, the <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual fortitude</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> did upon all occaſions demonſtrate, doth plainly demonſtrate the grace of God towards him. The miniſterial Office is compared to a ſouldiers imployment, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3, 4. where <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded <hi>to endure hardneſſe as a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Chriſt:</hi> And becauſe he is ſet apart for this ſpiritual warfare, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>muſt not entangle himſelf with the affaires of this life;</hi> and herein <hi>Paul</hi> did ſhew himſelf an excellent pattern. Was not he an excellent ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, when <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11, 12. he had learned <hi>in whatſoever estate, to be content;</hi> he knew <hi>how to abound, and how to want,</hi> every where, and in all things. He muſt needs have ſpiritual fortitude that could thus endure hot and cold. No wonder then if at the cloſe of his life, he hath this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony from his conſcience, <hi>That he had fought a good fight,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7. This is that which maketh the miniſterial work ſo difficult; we are to conflict with the luſts of men; we are to demoliſh the Kingdome of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;</hi> all our work, if faithfully diſcharged, breedeth nothing but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and oppoſition of ungodly men. And that this is wholly the gift of God, appeareth, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 7. God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a ſound mind; of power,</hi> that ſubdueth all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, and man-pleaſing; yet leſt this power ſhould make us too harſh and auſtere, there is <hi>love</hi> to mollifie and ſweeten it. For <hi>Dilige &amp; loquere quod vis,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin, Love, and then reprove as much as you will.</hi> But leſt love ſhould make us fooliſh, and too indulgent, there is added a <hi>ſound mind,</hi> as ſalt to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon this Sacrifice. Theſe are the qualifications of a Miniſter; but who giveth theſe? From whence doth this good and perfect gift come? <hi>Even from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights,</hi> Jam. 1. 17.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The grace of God proclaimed by <hi>Paul,</hi> was, <hi>In the heavenly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. His heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome.</note> 
                  <hi>wiſdome that he did uſe in the managing of his Office.</hi> For although he diſclaimeth fleſhly wiſdome, yet he attributeth to himſelf true heavenly wiſdome, he conſidered his auditours, what they were able to beare; he did not put new wine into old bottles; he had ſerpentine wiſdome, though Dove-like innocency. Wiſdome and diſcretion is the eye in the body of all our holy actions. Zeal without knowledge maketh a man like <hi>Samſon,</hi> when his eyes are pulled out; though he pull down the houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> yet he himſelf is alſo deſtroyed thereby. 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 1, 2. I could not ſpeake unto you, as ſpiritual, but as carnal. I fed you with milk, and not with meat. Argus</hi> was not fuller of eyes, then a Miniſter is to be of wiſdome and circumſpection, to know the diſpoſitions, capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and temptations of the people to whom he preacheth. But above all the Miniſters wiſdome is ſeen in laying a good and ſure foundation. This grace of God to him, <hi>Paul</hi> doth acknowledge, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 10. According to the grace of God given to me, as a wiſe maſter-builder I have laid a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For if we be not in juſtification built upon Chriſt, and in practice carried beyond morality, yea and religious duties to a principle of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration within; All other building, though never ſo glorious, and applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world, is but like an houſe built upon the ſand, whoſe fall will be great, when tempeſts ſhall ariſe. It was from this <hi>wiſdome</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I became all things to all men, that I might ſave ſome,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 22. Not in that ſenſe as the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> is ſaid, <hi>to become all things to all men,</hi> for
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:48709:233"/>
that is to ſave one, not to ſave, but rather deſtroy others: he did not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully comply with mens ſinnes, but he did prudently accommodate himſelf to mens weakneſſes, not defiling himſelf thereby, that to he might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> them out of their weakneſſes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The grace of God acknowledged by <hi>Paul,</hi> is, <hi>The ſucceſſe he had</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. His ſucceſſe in his Miniſtry</note> 
                  <hi>in his miniſterial labours.</hi> For though <hi>Paul</hi> was inabled to doe many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to cure many diſeaſed bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he could not open the eyes, or change the heart of any one man; whenſoever therefore an effectual door was opened to him, in any place; this was Gods work, not <hi>Paul</hi>'s, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. For though <hi>Paul planted, and Apollo watered, yet it is God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> Alas, it is not for a Miniſter to thinke his parts, his gifts, his learning, his diligent and zealous preaching ſhall bring men off from their wicked wayes. For though the Miniſter is to do his duty, yet his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe is of Gods grace onely: And therefore wonder not, if <hi>Paul</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all the learned and potent enemies of the Goſpel, if <hi>Paul</hi>'s contemptibleneſſe overcome the <hi>Grecians</hi> wiſdome and excellency; for it's not <hi>Paul,</hi> but the grace of God with him that doth theſe wondrous things.</p>

               <p>WE are come now to the thing teſtified it ſelf, which is this, <hi>We have had our converſation in the world.</hi> So that herein is expreſſed the ground of his comfort, and that in two particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was his <hi>converſation,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This word is uſed to ſignifie the <hi>way,</hi> as the Scripture calleth it, or the <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>conſtant cuſtomary practice of man.</hi> Sometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is added to it, not that it can be our <hi>converſation,</hi> unleſſe it be <hi>univerſal,</hi> and every where ſo. But for further aggravation, as 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 15. But as he that hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi> If a man be holy at ſome times, or in ſome fits, but not conſtantly, he doth not reſemble God, for God is holy in all his wayes. In every action, and all times, God doth manifeſt his holineſſe, he is a God, and changeth not, is alwayes like himſelf: Thus it ought to be with the godly: No company, no condition, no temptations ſhould make them change that holy way of life, they are to exerciſe themſelves in. Hence alſo 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11. we have it rendred in the plural number, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>What manner of perſons ought we to be in godly converſations;</hi> ſignifying, that the day of judgement power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully believed, would have a ſtrong influence upon every thought, word or action, that there cannot be any kind of godlineſſe, though never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fleſh and blood, but we ſhould be thereby provoked to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof. <hi>Varinus</hi> maketh the ſynonimous words to <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which is our perpetual exerciſe and life, as it were. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> rendered <hi>converſation,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. and ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 1. as alſo <hi>Philip. 1. 27. Let your converſation be as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Gospel;</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The ſecond word expreſſive, is, <hi>In the world.</hi> It is not at one place, or in ſome company onely, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth thus ſincerely behave himſelf, but in the world, every where, in all places where he cometh, <hi>Locum, non ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> he may change his place, and his company, but never his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
               <p>Whereas then we ſee, <hi>Paul</hi> gathering his comfort not from ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actions done at ſome time, or in ſome place, but from the whole
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:48709:234"/>
carriage, and conſtant deportment of himſelf. We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is not ſo much ſome good actions done at ſome times, as the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is univerſal holineſſe which is the ground of comfort.</note> 
                  <hi>univerſall carriage of our ſelves in holy things, that doth bring ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine is of ſpecial uſe. For who will not be godly? Who may not be thought to belong to the Kingdome of Heaven? If you look upon them, in ſome fits, while under ſome dangers, while ſome ſudden pangs are upon them; but God will judge thee, not according to theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but the whole courſe of thy life. It is true, ſometimes thou haſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſometimes thy heart hath been ſmitten under the guilt of thy ſinnes; but how quickly have theſe paſſed over again? Theſe are not thy daily exerciſe: The harmony of thy life is not holy and godly. There are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable inſtances of men, who in ſome ſtreights and imminent dangers have appeared penitent and reformed, but all hath been forced and compelled, as it were; their conſtant, habitual inclination was otherwiſe. Did not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in ſome extremities cry out, <hi>He had ſinned,</hi> and deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him? Did not <hi>Ahab</hi> under Gods judgements humble himſelf in ſackcloth? Yea was it not the complaint of the Prophets concerning the people of the <hi>Iſrael, That in their tribulations they did call upon God?</hi> But then afterwards would return to their proper courſe again, <hi>Pſalm. 78. 34, 35, 36, 37. When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, they returned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired early after God.</hi> Theſe words declare much activity and ſolicitude in them, for a while at leaſt to become reconciled with God: But then what followeth? <hi>They did flatter with their mouth, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfast in his Covenant.</hi> And before at <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. they are ſaid, <hi>To be a generation that ſet not their heart aright, and whoſe ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God.</hi> So that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are a perpetual inſtance to confirme this Doctrine, that it is not ſo much to be regarded how holy and repenting we may appear ſometimes, but what we are conſtantly, that is to be regarded.</p>
               <p>To clear this, take notice,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Scripture ſpeaketh of a two-fold <hi>converſation,</hi> and the one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly <note place="margin">There is a two-fold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, the one natural.</note> contrary to the other, whoſe ends alſo are contrary.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is, <hi>A wicked, carnal, and natural one,</hi> which all live in, till God by his gracious power deliver us from it. What is every mans converſation till grace change him, but a continual road of evil actions? he goeth from one ſinne to another, he is alwayes like himſelf, as the worm is ever creeping upon the ground, you never ſee it flying like a bird up to the clouds. This is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Our former converſation,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 22. <hi>which is corrupt according the deceitfull luſts thereof.</hi> The firſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> then of every one by nature, is that of the old man, original and actual ſinnes conjoyned together into one body, as it were; ſo that he is a maſſe, or lumpe of ſinne: This is daily corrupted by deceitfull luſts: That as worms are continually eating into the Tree, till they have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: Thus are luſts conſtantly breeding in a man, even till they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him. Now, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, This muſt be put off;</hi> we muſt leave this former life, and take up a new one. Oh how few are there that can ſay, <hi>They have put off their former converſation!</hi> As they were prophane, proud, earthly, ſo they are ſtill: They cannot ſay, It was indeed their former drinking, their former ſwearing, but it is their preſent praying, their preſent humiliation of themſelves: Their latter converſation differeth from the former, as much as the day doth from the night that went before
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:48709:235"/>
it. This is alſo called a <hi>vain converſation received by tradition from our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18. It is a <hi>vain one:</hi> for all the life we live, till regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is ſpent in vain; we attain not to the true and proper end of living. Thy eating, thy drinking, thy buying and ſelling is all in vain; by none of theſe things wilt thou pleaſe God, and ſo arrive at laſt at eternal glory: Yea it were well, if it were only vain miſſing its end, but it's meritorious of eternal flames in hell. This converſation is ſaid to be <hi>traditional by our fathers.</hi> If the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> then it is true, that children follow the evil, and ungodly examples of their parents; they will not ſeem to be better and wiſer than they are; if of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, then it relateth to thoſe ſuperſtitious exerciſes of Religion, which their fathers added to the command of God. And although they reſted and gloried in theſe, as thereby highly honouring of God, yet all was but a vain worſhip, a vain Religion. So then a mans evil converſation, is not only to be extended to his vices and ſinnes, but alſo to his religious duties, when either not inſtituted, or if commanded, yet not performed in that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner, which the Law of God doth require. So that a mans <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> in his praying, in his coming to Church, in his religious deportments, muſt be altered, as well as prophane wayes. Thou muſt leave off thy former way of praying, thy former way of hearing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of <hi>converſation</hi> mentioned in the Scripture, is, <hi>A godly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The other is an heavenly and godly converſation.</note> 
                  <hi>and an heavenly one.</hi> So that although we live upon the earth, yet our principles, aims, and ends, carry us up to the enjoyment of God. This is called a <hi>good converſation,</hi> Jam. 3. 13. where all divine faith and ſpiritual wiſdom is ſaid to be demonſtrated by a <hi>good converſation.</hi> It is not Doctrine, faith, profeſſion, or gifts that men look at, but the <hi>converſation,</hi> that ſpeaketh a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that ſpeaketh a Miniſter more than ten thouſand excellent diſcourſes; <hi>Plus oculis quam auribus creditur,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca.</hi> So that a <hi>good converſation</hi> is more demonſtrative of godlineſſe, then good gifts, good parts, a good faith. Thy prayers are good, thy conference and diſcourſe is good; Is thy converſation alſo? Hence <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>Timothy</hi> as a Miniſter to be a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>An example</hi> (1 Tim. 4. 12.) <hi>to believers in word, in converſation. In word,</hi> that is, in his Doctrine and preaching. <hi>In converſation,</hi> that is, in the exerciſe of all holy duties. So that you ſee a man is above all things to look to his conveſation that it be good. For as this is a ſpecial means to edifie and build up others; ſo none can take comfort from the choiſeſt abilities, the moſt fervent duties, the pureſt Church-wayes, unleſſe there be a good converſation to uphold him. Hence you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> doth not runne to his Apoſtolical Office, to his great miracles, to the wonderfull revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and gifts beſtowed upon him, but to his <hi>converſation in the world,</hi> as if that were a greater conviction of all adverſaries, then the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church-prerogatives or priviledges that can be. Hence a godly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation</hi> is a ſpecial means to convert others. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh fully to this concerning godly women, who have Heathen, or wicked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly husbands, that they ſhould look to their duty, <hi>That they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word be wone by the converſation of their wives, while they behold your chaſte converſation coupled with fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2. he ſaith, <hi>Without the Word;</hi> not but that the Word is the onely ordinary means of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but becauſe their converſation may be an occaſion and introductory meanes to bring them to the Word. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, He ſhould not have believed the Scriptures, but for the Church, becauſe that was the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory motive, though the Scriptures themſelves were the cauſe of his faith. By this we ſee how much regard we are to have to our converſation, for by it many may be converted, or be ſubverted. What a wofull thing will
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:48709:235"/>
it be, if thou by thy life haſt given a juſt occaſion to drive men off from godlineſſe; They were coming on, but thy converſation drove them back. It is true, when wicked men doe wickedly from their owne corrupt hearts, take an occaſion to be offended at Gods wayes, as ſome did when they heard Chriſt preach, ſaying, <hi>It was an hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi> And from thence took an occaſion never to follow Chriſt more, <hi>John</hi> 6. 60. then the guilt of ſuch men lieth at their owne doore; They are offended where there is no juſt cauſe; it's <hi>Scandalum acceptum,</hi> not <hi>datum.</hi> But if thou doeſt by any ſinfull and unwarrantable practiſes alienate men from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, make them think the worſe of godlineſſe for thy doings, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that dreadfull ſentence of our Saviour, <hi>Woe be to that man by whom offences come,</hi> Matth. 18. 7. This is likewiſe called, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Your good converſation in Chriſt.</hi> A Scripture-converſation is a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Chriſt,</hi> that is partly by the rule and guidance of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> We live not according to the courſe of the world, not according to the luſts of men, but as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath commanded, ſo we live; and then partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by <hi>Chriſts</hi> blood we do obtain this life, he hath redeemed us from our former evil wayes, he hath purchaſed a liberty for us: and then part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe our life is terminated in Chriſt, and we doe objectively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him in all our wayes, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Galat. 2. 20. I live, yet not I; but Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> Chriſt is the principle or authour, Chriſt is the means and way, Chriſt is the finiſher and end of this life.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us conſider; <hi>What goeth to make a mans converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to a good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> 
                  <hi>godly,</hi> that we may ſay, it is not ſome ſudden motions, or tranſitory workings, but his converſation that is according to the Goſpel. For if ſome particular good actions at ſome times were enough to make a man godly, then the way to Heaven would be no longer a narrow, but a broad way. Now in this deſcription you muſt not expect a metaphyſical or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual deciſion, of how many actions goe to make a mans converſation: So that if he come up to ſuch a number, yet if he want one more, then it cannot be called his converſation: but we muſt underſtand it morally and in a large ſenſe. Briefly therefore to a mans converſation there is required as the foundation of all.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A principle of regeneration, to be made a new creature.</hi> There muſt be ſpiritual life, before there can be ſpiritual motions and actions. So that <note place="margin">1. Principles of grace.</note> if men are brought ſometimes to what is holy, by external motives, becauſe they have godly parents, godly Magiſtrates, godly Governonrs, as <hi>Joaſh</hi> all the while <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt, and his Uncle lived: This cannot be called a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; there is not a new nature within, but outward motives prevail with him, and thereupon as they ebb or flow, ſo is there a variation and change in his practices.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There muſt be a predominancy in his heart and affections to what is holy.</hi> Chriſt muſt be his treaſure, he muſt love him more than any <note place="margin">2. A predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy in the heart to Chriſt.</note> thing in the world, then father, or mother, or life it ſelf. For if the ſoul be not thus principally fixed on him, when that which is dearer, and more loved, doth ſuggeſt it ſelf, then they leave Chriſt. This is plainly ſeene, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. in thoſe hearers who believed for a while, and brought forth ſome fruit, but then when perſecutions did ariſe they fell off, then theſe ſeeming vines became thorns.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There muſt be an actual improvement of thoſe habitual principles</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Actual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of grace.</note> 
                  <hi>of grace that are within.</hi> For though a man have never ſo much grace within, yet if it be not improved by outward exerciſe, we cannot call it a godly converſation: and therefore it is a vain thing for men to appeale to the goodneſſe of their heart, and their good meanings; for the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:48709:236"/>
is more to be believed than all theſe. There muſt then be theſe ſtreames as well as the fountain; we muſt ſhew our faith (as you heard) by a godly converſation; ſo that this relateth moſt to the exerciſe of grace, though it preſuppoſe the fountain and root within.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To our converſation, <hi>There are required pure and heavenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Pure and heavenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> 
                  <hi>that we do holy duties for holineſſe ſake;</hi> That we follow Chriſt for Chriſts ſake, not for loaves. The old Rule is, <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia;</hi> He that doth a godly duty, becauſe godly, will do all godly duties. As the fire, becauſe it burneth naturally, it burneth in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as well as another: Thus a Chriſtian, becauſe carried out purely and naturally (as it were) to the things of God, doth own them every where, in all places, in all companies. That which is godlineſſe at one place, and in one company, is godlineſſe in another. Onely we muſt neceſſarily take along one Caution, leſt we condemn all the generation of the godly for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. <hi>A mans converſation is godly, though in many things he faileth by common infirmities,</hi> though in all things he cometh ſhort of that perfection which is required of him: Yea, though for a ſeaſon through prevailing temptations he fall into, and lie in ſome grievous ſinnes. <hi>David</hi>'s conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation may be called <hi>godly,</hi> he was a man after Gods own heart. And <hi>Peter's converſation</hi> may be godly, though he had ſuch a foul fall: So that infirmities, yea ſometimes groſſe ſinnes fallen into through urging tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cannot be ſaid to make a mans converſation wicked, when the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination of the ſoul is ſet for that which is good. It is true, he that doth cuſtomarily and habitually ſinne, he is not borne of God; neither can a regenerate man ſinne ſo, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9. Every ſwoon or fainting is not death, yet ſuch having the ſeed of grace within, will as Trees that ſeemed to be dead all winter, becauſe there is life in the root, at laſt revive and flouriſh when the ſpring of Gods grace ſhall draw it forth. This is neceſſary; leſt the Doctrine of a godly converſation ſeem onely an <hi>Idaea,</hi> like <hi>Tullies Oratour,</hi> and that it cannot be found any where in the world.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, let us ſee what profitable Uſes may be drawn from this truth. <note place="margin">Whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is not holy not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome good things in it.</note> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Of Inſtruction,</hi> who are to informe themſelves, their converſation is not holy, notwithſtanding ſome good things may ſometimes be found in their lives. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Such who in fear of death onely, and in times of ſad dangers doe call upon the Lord, and cry out of their ſinnes.</hi> Is this your converſation? Doe ye ever thus, but in ſome times of exigency? It is greatly diſputed, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a death-bed repentance can ever be ſincere? The <hi>Socinians</hi> are too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, denying the ſalvation of ſuch perſons, becauſe they have no time to ſhew forth good works in their converſation. But as this may be too rigid, ſo on the other ſide, <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and others put it greatly to the doubt, <hi>Non dico damnabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſed nec dico ſalvabitur,</hi> then is the converſation holy, when in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rich or poor, ſick or well, living or dying, thou doeſt diligently ſeek the face of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such cannot plead for an holy converſation in the world, <hi>Who are onely ſuch in ſome companies, and in ſome places.</hi> Many of the Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Iewes</hi> for fear of them. Thus if thou becauſe the company thou art with is religious, or in the place where thou liveſt, godlineſſe is owned with credit, then thou wilt alſo doe as they doe, talke as they talk: This is not thy <hi>converſation. Paul</hi> was godly in all the places of the world, even at <hi>Rome,</hi> and where he was in the greateſt danger. <hi>Lot</hi> was righteous in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Sodome.</hi> It is not with a godly man, as they ſay of ſome Trees, in
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:48709:236"/>
one Countrey they bring pleaſant and wholſome fruit, but if tranſplanted into another ſoil poiſonous and deſtructive: So he in ſome places ſpeaketh for godlineſſe, and in other places to laugh and deride it. This is not thy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither can ſuch pretend to a godly converſation, <hi>Who onely with</hi> Herod <hi>doe ſometimes gladly, or with</hi> Saul <hi>obey in ſome things, but rebell in other.</hi> If it were godlineſſe for godlineſſe ſake, then thou wouldſt zealouſly ſet upon all the duties of godlineſſe, great as well as little, ſelf-denying, as well as more gratefull and pleaſing. Yea the more godlineſſe, ſtill the more deſire and delight after it. If a drop be ſo precious, what would more plentifull drinkings of it? By what reaſon I am godly thus farre, Iam bound to proceed further.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let it be an <hi>Uſe of Exhortation,</hi> to look to godlineſſe in your converſation; it lieth there as well as in your hearts, in duties, in profeſſions. By this the Goſpel is adorned, by this Religion is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by this many others may be brought home to God, and glorifie him for beholding thy pure, holy and unblameable converſation. It is a ſigne grace hath deep rooting in thy heart and affections, when it's made pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and viſible in operations: It's by theſe fruits that we muſt judge of trees. The hypocrite would be applauded as much as the godly. Gifts and parts would be exalted, as grace, were not our converſations to be the true touchſtone herein; but above all things look to the purity of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in thy whole life, that alone maketh regular and uniforme; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this thou wilt cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt at one time, and <hi>crucifie him</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It's obſervable, that though a multitude did leave their own Towns and houſes, outwardly ſhewing much affection towards him, yet our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> chargeth them with carnal motives in all that they did, <hi>Iohn 6. 26. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, ye ſeeke me not, becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, bus becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were ſatisfied. Verily, verily]</hi> This ſacred aſſeveration Chriſt uſeth in matters of high concernment; and here it is, becauſe the <hi>Capernaites</hi> did not perceive this carnal frame in themſelves, therefore doth he expreſſe it the more vehemently. Thus <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> complained in his time, <hi>Vix quaeritur Jeſus propter Jeſum,</hi> Jeſus is ſcarcely ſought for Jeſus ſake. So difficult is it to be ſincere in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>

                  <p>Of Gods Preſence with the Miniſtry, how it renders the People inexcuſable.</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 12.</bibl>
                  <q>And more abundantly to you-wards.</q>

               <p>WE are now arrived at the cloſe and laſt particular of this verſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained the ground of <hi>Paul</hi>'s comfort, from the <hi>teſtimony of his conſcience.</hi> As the former particulars did declare his <hi>converſation,</hi> with the manner of it, univerſally without reſtriction or limitation to times, perſons, or places, ſo this laſt clauſe is added to affect the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the more, who liſtened too much to falſe Apoſtles, from his peculiar converſation to them, it was <hi>more abundantly towards them,</hi> then to any other in the world. Not that <hi>Paul</hi> was leſſe ſincere, or leſſe faithfull in other places; but only there were more outward effects and demonſtrations of it towards them, then to others. So that the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth denote the <hi>abundance and overflowing evidences</hi> of the power of God in his Miniſtry towards them. And this comparative may be taken both <hi>intenſively,</hi> his carriage towards them was fuller of love and compaſſion, fuller of care and diligence to them then others, becauſe they were in greater danger, and under more temptations. As alſo <hi>extenſively,</hi> there he had laboured more, continued longer, and the power of God had been more ſucceſſefull in his Miniſtry amongſt them. In the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſome render <hi>amongst you;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <hi>Beza</hi> ſheweth the phraſe uſed ſo out of <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi> Others render it <hi>towards you,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo the Apoſtle hath this expreſſion, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 4. That ye might know the love which I have more abundantly towards you.</hi> The like is alſo applied to <hi>Titus,</hi> in reference to them, his inward affection was more abundantly towards them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. If you ask, Wherein this greater abundance of <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſincere converſation was ſeen to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> more than to others? Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors give in ſeveral particulars. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and others following him, make it to be in this, that he preached the Goſpel freely to them. Here ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He went beyond his bounds,</hi> condeſcending to their infirmity. Now concerning this fact of <hi>Paul</hi>'s receiving no maintenance from theſe <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> though he did from others; and pleadeth he might alſo by right take off them, alledging the plain Ordinance and Inſtitution of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 13. Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, ſhould live of the Gospel.</hi> There is a two-fold controverſie, the former is ſtarted by the Papiſts, who from hence held the Doctrine of Counſels, as alſo of ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, that a man may do more than he is commanded, as they ſay <hi>Paul</hi> did in this caſe. The later is from others, who from hence decry the maintenance of Miniſters, and that they are with <hi>Paul</hi> to continue in ſome vocation, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves and family with; but becauſe here it is ſuppoſed only, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

in the Epiſtle it is profeſſedly owned by the Apoſtle, and inſiſted upon, we ſhall referre it, till God give opportunity to conſider it in its proper place. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7, 8, 9. Others they underſtand this <hi>greater abundance</hi> in reſpect of the length of that time, he continued amongſt them. For ye may read that <hi>Act. 18. 10, 11. Paul</hi> continued there <hi>a year and an half</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which was a great ſpace of time, conſidering how his Apoſtolical Office required of him the viſiting of other Churches, and planting alſo the Goſpel, where yet it was not received. They had therefore time enough to ſee his whole deportment, to obſerve that he was no fraudulent impoſtor, that he did all things for their own good, not ſeeking himſelf. 3. Some referre it to the <hi>great ſucceſſe</hi> and wonderfull power, that God did put forth in, and with his Miniſtry; for ſo God telleth him that viſion he had there, <hi>Act. 18. 9, 10, Be not afraid Paul, for I am with thee, no man ſhall hurt thee, for I have much people in this City.</hi> So that this was a great conviction that <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry ſhould work ſuch a mighty change among a people ſo proud, ſo rich, ſo glorying in parts and humane learning, as they did: This was the hand of God. Laſtly, It may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to his <hi>love towards them,</hi> which he ſeemeth to expreſſe to them more than others, and therefore ſpeaketh of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. yea he reproveth them for their ingratitude herein, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 15. I will very gladly be ſpent for you, though the more abundantly I love you, the leſſe I be loved.</hi> Now the reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> was thus affectionately carried out towards them more than others, was becauſe of the dangerous temptations they were in by falſe Apoſtles; theſe came with enticing words, pretending much love, and alſo obſerved ſtrictly every paſſage of <hi>Paul</hi>'s life; ſo that it behoved him, as to walk with more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, ſo alſo to expreſſe his hearty love towards them, ſeeing they were in ſuch a weak and uncertain condition. Even as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth, The affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of parents are moſt carried to thoſe who are the weakeſt, and moſt infirme. And thus much for explication. From the words we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the more evidences and demonſtrations a people have had of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Gods preſence hath been with the Miniſtry, the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable is the unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people under it.</note> 
                  <hi>with the Ministry, the more inexcuſable will they be, if they do not profit thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The longer you have enjoyed the meanes of grace, and the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully God hath manifeſted his preſence therein: If ſtill thou perſiſt in thy rebellion and oppoſition to God, the greater will thy condemnation be. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth much preſſe this upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as a ſpecial means to preſerve them from revolting, 2 <hi>Corinth. 13. Since ye ſeeke a proofe of Chriſt ſpeaking in me, which to you-ward is not weake, but mighty in you;</hi> and thereupon biddeth them, <hi>Examine themſelves, whether they be in the faith, or whether Chriſt be in them, or not.</hi> And if ſo, they muſt needs acknowledge this to be the fruit of his Miniſtry. Oh it is an high aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a mans wilfulneſſe to ſinne, when he cannot but be convinced, that the Miniſter doth his duty, he diſchargeth his Office, he hath inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me fully of my dangerous eſtate, yet for all that he will go on in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience! We read of the Apoſtles preſſing this likewiſe, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. 15. with much earneſtneſſe, <hi>Though you have ten thouſand inſtructors in Chriſt, yet have ye not many fathers.</hi> He was the firſt that through the grace of God, begot them a new from their former impieties. So that the more good a people have received by a Miniſter, the more they ſtand obliged ſtill to follow his Doctrine. Our Apoſtle dealeth in this Argument alſo with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 3. 2, 3, 4. <hi>This would I learne of you, received ye the Spirit by the workes of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:48709:238"/>
to what they had found experimentally by the preaching of the Goſpel upon their owne ſoules: and would they who had thus begunne in the ſpirit, end in the fleſh? Our Saviour alſo telleth the <hi>Iewes</hi> concerning <hi>John, They did once rejoyce in his light for a ſeaſon,</hi> John 5. 35. At the firſt, while his preaching and life was new, before he came throughly to convince them of their hypocriſie and wickedneſſe; and then when they ſaw his preaching was againſt them, and that he was not a man for their carnal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; they who once rejoyced in him afterwards reproached him, and ſaid, <hi>He had a Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us amplifie this point in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The longer time a people have enjoyed a faithfull Ministry, the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The longer time a people have enjoyed the means of grace, they'll be more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, if they anſwer not Gods expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> 
                  <hi>more inexcuſable will they be, if they anſwer not Gods expectation.</hi> A great part of the world ſitteth in darkneſſe, and have nothing of this ſpiritual light ariſing upon them; They have had no Prophet amongſt them, to warne and admoniſh every man to forſake his evil way. If therefore God hath fixed Paſtours and Teachers amongſt us, who continually informe us of our duties: How great will our condemnation be, if we ſhut our eyes againſt light? Though thou doeſt not account the yeares, yet God doth; he taketh notice of the preciſe time, that he hath been calling and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thee, to come in, and ſubmit unto him. We ſee this notably in that Parable, <hi>Luke 13. 7. Then ſaid the Maſter to his Vine-dreſſer, Behold theſe three yeares I come ſeeking fruit on this fig-tree, and finde none.</hi> It is but <hi>three yeares,</hi> and yet this is accounted a great matter; their unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, though they had but <hi>three yeares</hi> trial was ſo hainous, that there is a command <hi>to cut down the tree,</hi> as that <hi>which cumbreth the ground.</hi> What cauſe then haſt thou to fear leſt ſuch a ſentence paſſe upon thee, who haſt not onely for <hi>three yeares,</hi> but <hi>many threes</hi> been dreſſed and pruned, and yet continueſt barren? How ſhould you number every Lords-day? How ſhould you account and ſet downe every Sermon? For though you let them paſſe, yet God will not. Thus we have God complaining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> mentioning the exact time, they had been froward and rebellious againſt him under his gracious diſpenſations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 10. which is alſo alſo alledged by the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr. 3. 9, 17. They ſaw Gods workes fourty years in the wilderneſſe.</hi> What a long time was here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, to humble them under all theſe wonderfull workes which God did before their eyes, yet God complaineth, that theſe <hi>fourty yeares,</hi> they did only grieve God by their ſinnes and provocations? And is not this the ſad caſe of too many? May not God ſay fourty, yea fifty and threeſcore years; Ye have grieved him every Sabbath-day, becauſe not reformed or chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word? Remember this therefore, the longer that the Miniſters of God have continued with you, the more is all excuſe taken off from you, if ye repent not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The more faithfull and diligent the Miniſters of God have been</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The more faithfull the Miniſter is, the more in excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable will the people be.</note> 
                  <hi>by publick preaching and otherwayes, to convert you from all your evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the greater will your account be, if ye be negligent about your ſoules.</hi> Indeed people may have a Miniſtry, but becauſe a lazy corrupt one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſuperſtitious or prophane one; men are encouraged more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in their wickedneſſe. And although this will not free a people, they ſhall not think to eſcape by laying the fault upon their blinde guides; for rather than their bodies ſhould ſtarve, they would break thorow ſtony walls, and goe farre before they would be famiſhed: So if people were ſenſible of their ſoules undoing by ſuch a Miniſtry; if they lived where the famine of the Word is, they would wander from ſea to ſea; and from the North even to the Eaſt, to look the word of God, as you have it,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:48709:238"/>
                  <hi>Amos,</hi> Chap. 8. 12. Though I ſay, the people will not be acquitted, they ſhall die and be damned in their ſinnes; yet God will require their blood of ſuch <hi>Idol-ſhepherds,</hi> Ezek. 33. 8, 9. But as it followeth there, <hi>If they be faithfull ſhepherds, if they doe warne every wicked man, and yet they will goe on in their evil way,</hi> then ſuch faithfull Miniſters <hi>have delivered their owne ſoules, and the peoples blood will lie upon their owne head.</hi> The more paines then, and the greater labour that the Miniſters of God have taken to reduce men from their evil wayes, and yet thou continueſt unreformed, the greater will thy confuſion be: Their ſtudy, their Sermons, their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, their ſweat, their wearineſſe, will all witneſſe againſt thee at that day. We may ſee this notably fulfilled in Chriſt himſelf, that great ſhepherd of our ſouls, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 20. It is there ſaid, <hi>Then began he to upbraid thoſe Cities, wherein moſt of his mighty workes were done, becauſe they repented not. Woe to thee Corazin, woe to thee Bethſaida,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou Capernaum which art exalted unto Heaven.</hi>—By this we ſee, the more abundantly Chriſt had diſcovered his willingneſſe for their ſalvation, and they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, the greater woe did belong to them; yea it would be worſe with them at the Day of Judgement, than the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> the vileſt of men, whom God deſtroyed with ſuch a ſudden and terrible deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The more ſucceſſe that the Miniſtry hath had, where thou liveſt, the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Where the Miniſtry is more ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent are more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</note> 
                  <hi>greater change and converſion it hath made, and yet thou continue the ſame prophane perſon thou waſt, the greater is thy guilt.</hi> When it ſhall be a converting Word to others, but not to thee; an enlightning Word to others, but not to thee: Oh do thou tremble under thy condition, leſt God hath given thee up to a ſpiritual judgment, that no preaching, no Miniſtry, no, if Angels ſhould come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or men raiſed from the dead, yet they ſhould do no good upon thee. If there be but one man, or woman in a Pariſh, that can bleſſe God for the good their ſoules have got by the hearing of the Word; this perſon will ariſe at the Day of Judgement againſt thee, then God will ſay, Why was it not a converting Word to thee, as well as him? Why did thy neighbours heare and tremble, reforme and tremble, but thou didſt not?</p>
               <p>Now the ſucceſſe of a faithfull Miniſtery may be ſeen in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. <note place="margin">Wherein the ſucceſs of a faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is ſeen.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To enlighten thee, to inſtruct and teach thee in the wayes of God.</hi> For this end they are called <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi> Obſerve then, if there be not many that have got knowledge in the truths of God, when thou art ignorant how many by thee do know the principles of Religion; the Miniſtry hath been inſtrumental to awaken them: ſo that thoſe who were ignorant do now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: this will condemn thee, who liveſt in thy ſottiſh ignorance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſucceſſe of the Miniſtry is ſeen, <hi>In the converſion and reforming of men from their evil wayes.</hi> To turn ſwine into ſheep, weeds into flowers, as we read of three thouſand converted by one Sermon that <hi>Peter</hi> made. If then, God hath bleſſed our labours in this kind, though it ſhould be but to one man in the Congregation, this will be a teſtimony againſt you. Was not he once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, as thou art? Did not he follow all exceſſe of riot, as thou doeſt? Did not he deride and ſcorn at the power of godlineſs, as thou doeſt? but now he is wholly altered, now he dare not do the things he once did: Now he crieth out, Oh ſuch a Sermon ſtruck to my very heart, ſuch a paſſage was like a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt! Why then is it that thou doeſt not follow ſuch a man, and do as he doth? He would not be the ſame worldling, the ſame prophane perſon he was once for a world. Oh remember this mans converſion, this mans change will be a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt thee!</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="452" facs="tcp:48709:239"/>
3. The ſucceſſe of the Miniſtry is not only to give <hi>ſpiritual life at first, but to quicken up, to edifie and to cauſe to grow up more and more in godlineſſe;</hi> that you may not be a people alwayes in low principles, that you may not be babes alwayes, but be more ſpiritual, and greater proficients in godlineſs than formerly. Thus our Saviour prayed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. for the Diſciples already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that they might be more ſanctified. And here again is condemning matter to thoſe who ſtand at a ſtay; yea it may be go back, and fall off from their firſt love. Oh lay this to heart? Seeſt thou not how ſuch and ſuch, that did but lately look towards Heaven, have overgone thee? they have more knowledge, more grace, more life and vigour than thou haſt. Certainly this maketh thy caſe the ſadder; they are planted by the ſame waters thou art, hear the ſame Sermons, receive the ſame Ordinances, and yet are farre more fruitfull than thou art.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another particular wherein the ſucceſſefull efficacy of the Miniſtry doth appear, is, <hi>To antidote againſt errours, to preſerve from giddineſſe and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe in matters of Religion.</hi> This great effect of the Miniſtry the Apoſtle taketh notice of, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14. where it is ſaid, <hi>God gave gifts to men, Apoſtles and Paſtors to his Church, that henceforth we be no more children, toſſed up and down with every wind of dóctrine.</hi> This implieth, that before the Miniſtry came, they were toſſed up and down; but now it muſt be no more ſo. This alſo will ſpeak terrible guilt to ſome; who are fallen off from the wholſom truths of God, who have left their own ſtedfaſtneſs, being carried away with the errour of the wicked. For thoſe who have been preſerved and confirmed by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, will be a teſtimony againſt ſuch Apoſtates.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The word of God preached, though it may not throughly reforme, yet it doth ſometimes <hi>reſtrain men from ſinne.</hi> Sometimes it maketh them with <hi>Felix tremble;</hi> at other times with <hi>Agrippa, almoſt to become a Chriſtian.</hi> Oh let ſuch remember thoſe times. You have felt the word of God like fire in your bowels; you have found it to be like a two-edged ſword within. Know that all thoſe relentings and troubled agonies of ſoul, will be a condemnation one day. The Word preached hath more abundantly worked upon you than others, though it hath not yet obtained a full and perfect change upon thee. Thus you ſee, whereſoever the word of God hath appeared more abundantly in any one particular in that reſpect, the greater is the aggravation of thoſe mens ſins, who have not thereby been reformed.</p>
               <p>Let us proceed to the Uſes. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. This may aggravate the ſinne of all thoſe who are now departed from the Miniſtry and the Ordinances, who are ſo arrogantly puffed up with a ſuppoſed perfection, that they think they need not either hear or pray, as if all fulneſs did dwell in them. Now to theſe men we propound this Queſtion, <hi>How came you at firſt to that light, to that knowledge you have? How came you at firſt out of your prophaneneſſe? Whence was it that your conſciences were awakened once? Was not all this at firſt by the Ministry! If there be any good in you, did you not receive it from theſe ſtreams of God? Why then is it that you depart from us? Why is it that you despiſe what once you imbraced?</hi> Certainly our Miniſtry hath had more of Gods power and preſence to you-wards, then to many ignorant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons: but this maketh your ſin greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use 2. To inſtruct us, how inexcuſable all they are, who live now under Gospel-light, and yet are not reclaimed from their evil wayes.</hi> For though one particular Miniſtry may have more of life and power than another, yet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt is faithfully preached, there is the ſtrongeſt argument that can be uſed to bring you to God. All that do now refuſe us preaching, refuſe Chriſt ſpeaking from Heaven, as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. This is more than to refuſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the Prophets, yea then Angels, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. And therefore
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:48709:239"/>
the Apoſtle propoundeth this Queſtion, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and afterwards was confirmed by others, God bearing them witneſſe by ſignes and many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi> So that now the things of Religion cannot be more abundantly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you than they are; you are not to expect more powerfull means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert you, than have been uſed; and this will make Hell ſeven times hotter for all ungodly and prophane perſons, who are ſo under theſe Goſpel-diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>

And indeed this is a good demonſtration of that uprightneſs which is within us, when we can appeal to the conſciences of others. For although men, eſpecially ſuch as are prejudiced and alienated from us, may ſuffocate and ſmother as much as lie in them, that they have any ſuch convictions of our integrity, yet ſecretly their conſciences cannot but bear witneſs to us. The matter then wherein he doth appeal, as it were, to their own conſciences, is ſet down in the beginning of the verſe, <hi>For we write no other things unto you,</hi> &amp;c. There is one expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in this paſſage, that hath much perplexed Interpreters, and made them go different wayes; it is, that <hi>we write no other things unto you, then what you do,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

Now this is wondered at by ſome, yea by <hi>Calvin</hi> accounted, <hi>Nimis fligidum, ne dicam ineptum,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in loc.</hi> It is <hi>too frigid</hi> and <hi>abſurd,</hi> to make this the ſenſe, <hi>I write to you no other things, then what you read,</hi> &amp;c. For who doubted of that? And how could any man read otherwiſe than he wrote, ſaith <hi>Muſculus? Eſtius</hi> alſo doth confeſs, that the rendring the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Ye read,</hi> did cauſe great perplexity to Expoſitors; and therefore ſheweth, that <hi>Theophylact,</hi> when he could not ſatisfie himſelf about that ſenſe of the word, did runne to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet there are learned men, that endeavour to make a good ſenſe of it, though it be tranſlated <hi>[Ye read:]</hi> For <hi>Beza,</hi> though he taketh notice of what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith againſt it, yet followeth this tranſlation, and would make this <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, <hi>That he did not write cunningly, artificially what they did read
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:48709:240"/>
in the plain letter of the words that he did write, he had no equivocations, nor intended any deluſions by his words. Cajetan in loc.</hi> he maketh this expreſſion to referre to the former Epiſtle, and alſo to this part of the ſecond which we are now upon, <hi>We write no more now, then what ye have read formerly.</hi> Therefore ſome render it in the preterperfect tenſe. Others they make the general ſenſe to be this, <hi>Our words, and our actions do agree, we write no more than what may be read, and acknowledged by all.</hi> Though theſe interpretations may paſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well; yet becauſe the expreſſion is not ſo full and proper to ſay, <hi>We write no other things, then what you read,</hi> I ſhall rather go with thoſe, who ſay, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, though it many times ſignifieth <hi>to read,</hi> yet it doth alſo, <hi>to take notice of, to know, to remember,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed I find it not in this ſenſe uſed in the New Teſtament, but conſtantly for <hi>to read;</hi> yet <hi>Varinus,</hi> he maketh it to ſignifie as well <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and ſignifieth more. For a man may <hi>know, and remember,</hi> yea and be <hi>convinced of many things,</hi> which yet through ſome corruption within, he will not <hi>acknowledge:</hi> for that is, when we do with a ready and willing conſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and own ſuch a thing. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were often convinced about Chriſts Doctrine, yet they would not acknowledge it. But the Apoſtle attributeth both theſe to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>From the words thus explained, we obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a godly convincing life in a Chriſtian, especially in a Miniſter, is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing life is of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſpecial advantage for many excellent effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Chriſtian, and much more every Miniſter, are by their lives and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſo to convince, that others may acknowledge, verily God is with them, verily the Spirit of Chriſt dwelleth in them. This is no more, then what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour expreſſeth, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men,</hi> Mat. 5. 16. <hi>that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Some make this exhortation given to Chriſtians in the general: Others to the Miniſters of the Goſpel in particular. However by this we ſee, that God cannot bear meer ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, names and opinions, unleſſe there be an holy life accompanying of them; he ſaith, <hi>That they may ſee your good works,</hi> not titles, not profeſſions, not your ceremonious, and inſtituted worſhip, but <hi>good works; good works</hi> then are neceſſary; but ſuch as flow from men enlightned by the Goſpel-truth. Many miſtake about <hi>good works,</hi> not knowing what the nature of them is; and then Chriſt ſheweth the end of theſe <hi>good works, That they may glorifie your Father which is in Heaven;</hi> not that they may glorifie you, and honour you. We are not to do good things for applauſe and eſteem; neither doth he ſay, that ye may merit a reward in Heaven. Vain-glory and merit, with ſelf-confidence, are the end why phariſaical men cauſe their light to ſhine before others; but the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Chriſtian, he doth it, <hi>That God may be glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us cauſe the light of this Doctrine alſo to ſhine before you. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are to know, <hi>That godlineſſe and exact holineſſe hath a convincing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Godlineſſe hath a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting effect with it.</note> 
                  <hi>and converting effect with it.</hi> The ſincere practice of it doth awe and conquer the conſcience, even of the vileſt men. Godlineſs is the image of God. Now when God created man, in that he gave him dominion over all the beaſts of the field, they ſtood in awe of him: And thus where the image of God is repaired, there it hath a convincing work upon the conſcience of the moſt beaſtly men.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:48709:240"/>
Thus it is ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> though a King, who had command over <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> life, as the event ſhewed, yet <hi>he feared John, becauſe he was a juſt man,</hi> Mark 6. 20. As the luſtre of the Sunne-beams do dazle the Owls and the Bats eyes: Thus doth the lively expreſſion of holineſs even amaze the moſt profligate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; neither is this the leſſe true, though wicked men rage, blaſpheme and raiſe all manner of calumnies againſt ſuch who walk uprightly, for in the midſt of this madneſs their conſcience is ſtill awed and convinced. So that this doth diſcover the excellency of a godly life, that it breedeth a reverential awe, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the conſciences of men ſecretly to own ſuch, and to wiſh that they were as ſuch, and that their latter end might be like theirs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Although a godly life be thus neceſſary in every Chriſtian, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The efficacy of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry depends not upon the piety of the Miniſter.</note> 
                  <hi>in a Miniſter, yet the efficacy of the Miniſtry, and ſacramental adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doth not depend upon the holy life of a Miniſter, no more than the Papiſts ſay, it doth upon a Miniſters intention.</hi> This was a <hi>Donatiſtical</hi> errour of old, ſo much oppoſed by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that the wickedneſs of a Miniſters life, did fruſtrate the work of the Sacraments. Certainly Chriſts promiſe is made to the Office, and to the right adminiſtration of the Ordinances; neither can the evil life of the Miniſter make void Gods promiſe of preſence to his own Ordinances, where people come in a prepared and holy manner. This our Saviour ſeemeth fully to confirm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. where he directed his hearers, <hi>To hear the Phariſees and Scribes, becauſe ſitting in Moſes his chair, and to obſerve what thoſe teachers ſhould bid them obſerve and do;</hi> but (ſaith he) <hi>do not after their works, for they ſay, and do not.</hi> This Text doth confute two ſorts of men; firſt, Thoſe of the <hi>Romane</hi> party, who make uſe of this againſt the Proteſtants, as if it were their ſinne to depart from their Biſhops and Paſtors, though it be granted they ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added many ſuperſtitious and corrupt doctrines, which we would eaſily yeeld unto: if as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chair; ſo they did in Chriſts chair. For this phraſe denoteth two things: 1. <hi>A lawfull Call and Office. 2. True and ſound Doctrine;</hi> our Saviour did not mean they were to do every thing the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid. For at another time he bid them, <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> which was their doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 6. But his univerſal expreſſion is to be limited to the ſubject matter, while they did teach what <hi>Moſes</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But we deny that the <hi>Roman Biſhops</hi> have Chriſts chair, either in reſpect of their Office, or their doctrine. Again the ſecond errour which this Text doth confute, is the extremity of thoſe, who becauſe of ſome corruption in the Miniſters, do wholly cry down the Miniſtry it ſelf, or out of their oppoſition to what is bad, will not receive that which is wholſome and good. Our Saviour being to reprove the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in a moſt ſharp way, as hypocrites and blind guides, knowing how apt people are to runne from one extremity to another; doth therefore adviſe them, that ſo farre as they keep to <hi>Moſes</hi> his doctrine, ſo farre they are to be attended unto, though by their ill lives they deſtroy all. Thus hungry men will eat the meat provided for them at the feaſt, not conſidering whether the Maſters of the feaſt do eat or no: Yea though they do not, yet they will not forbear; or as <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> Men that dig for gold, will gladly take their fulneſs of that, although the ground that yeeldeth it, be barren and unfruitfull in reſpect of graſs and flowers: But I cannot ſay all that is to be ſaid on this point. Therefore</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>Though the efficacy of Ordinences dependeth not upon the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of him that doth adminiſter, yet all ſuch dispenſers can have no comfort from</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Yet ſuch Miniſters as are not godly, cannot expect comfort from God, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him.</note> 
                  <hi>God; neither may they expect acceptance from him, while they live in their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Mat. 7. 22. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out Devils?</hi> Yet you read of that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible denunciation towards them, <hi>Depart from me, I know ye not.</hi> It is a very ſad thing to conſider how much Chriſtians will reſt on titles and names, vpon Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48709:241"/>
and external duties, thinking theſe will carry them to Heaven, though otherwiſe full of impiety. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> argueth againſt this poſition that <hi>faith without a holy converſation will ſave,</hi> as if it were a Doctrine plauſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Certainly in <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time it was ſo univerſally entertained, that a right faith would ſave, though ſeparated from a godly life, that he doth warily, though ſincerely ſit himſelf againſt it. As it is thus with Chriſtians, ſo alſo with Miniſters and Officers of the Church, how apt are they to be confident, and to be puſſed up, becauſe if they have a true Call, Church-government and Order according to Chriſts Inſtitution? not ſo diligently attending to the ſtrict and holy practice of godlineſs, as they ought to do. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh notably to this point, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6, 7. where he taxeth them for their boaſting in many Church-priviledges, when impiety was not cenſured amongſt them, <hi>Your glorifying is not good;</hi> They gloried in their teachers, they magnified their abilities and gifts; but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>This is not good:</hi> All this is vanity as long as wicked men are ſuffered amongſt you. So that you ſee, neither parts or gifts, nor divine Inſtitutions and Officers in the Church of God, without godly and holy lives are matter of any true and ſolid comfort. Therefore we cannot paſſe by that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy obſervation which <hi>Muſculus</hi> hath upon this paſſage of <hi>Paul</hi>'s en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging himſelf, not from his Apoſtolical office, not from his miraculous and extraordinary gifts, but his ſincere converſation. The Catholical corruption of the Church came in, when this peſtilence had infected the Officers of the Church, that they did not think it ſo much material, how they had their converſation in the world, ſo that they kept faithfull to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea. <hi>And would to God</hi> (as he goeth on) <hi>theſe vanities did not prevail in thoſe Churches, which are freed from Antichriſtianiſm; and this poiſonous root</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not a little watered of thoſe, who cannot ſpeak of the dispenſation of the myſteries of God, unleſſe they often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate, that it is not ſo material how the Miniſter liveth, ſo that Chriſts Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are exactly obſerved.</hi> Thus he, adding more alſo to this point. This is enough to ſhew, That the Reformed Churches are not to reſt upon their Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrine, Reformed Diſcipline, unleſs alſo the lives of all in their reſpective places be commenſurated to the rule of God.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, <hi>When we ſpeak of a convincing holy life, that may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood two wayes,</hi> either, 1. <hi>Potentially,</hi> ſuch as is apt to convince, and of its <note place="margin">4. A godly life is convincing, either poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> own nature tendeth thereunto. Or, 2. <hi>Actually</hi> and <hi>eventually,</hi> which doth ſo convince, as that it draweth out an acknowledgement, when they do <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This diſtinction is to be obſerved; for the former many times is without the later. Even as the Sun is in it ſelf moſt viſible, and yet to a blind man it doth not enlighten him: ſo it many times falleth out, that godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and godly Chriſtians do live convincing lives; ſo that they will be a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony at the day of judgement againſt all impenitent ſinners, and yet the world will not acknowledge this. It is plain in Chriſt; whoſe life could be every way way more convincing than his? What ſinne could they charge upon him? He was not even as the beſt Miniſters of God are, ſo ſubject to infirmities, to raſhnes, to paſſions, to worldlineſs, or any other evil; and yet for all that his Miniſtry and life did not ſo actually convince many of his hearers, as that they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be the Sonne of God, the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and Saviour of the world. Some indeed did acknowledge him, but the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> theſe ſaid, <hi>He was an impoſtor, a blasphemer,</hi> and therefore they put him to death, as judging him a falſe Prophet. Thus you ſee that there may be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing life, and yet for all that men will be obſtinate and malicious, hardening themſelves againſt the duties required of them. <note place="margin">What are the cauſes that make godly lives oft not convincing.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is good to take notice of ſome of thoſe cauſes that keep men from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that ſuch Miniſters, or ſuch people walk in the wayes of the Lord, and therefore we are to walk in their ſteps: As</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:48709:241"/>
1. <hi>Prejudice and prepoſſeſſed principles already received, whereby we ſtop the ear like the Adder, and will not hear the voice of the beſt charmer and wiſeſt.</hi> Thus <note place="margin">1. Prejudice.</note> it was with many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they had a tradition that no good, no Prophet could ariſe out of <hi>Galilee;</hi> They expected a <hi>Meſſias</hi> that in a temporal pompous <hi>manner</hi> ſhould deliver them from all external bondage, and therefore they would not be convinced by any thing that Chriſt did, or ſaid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Corrupt and earthly affections, when our hearts are ſet upon any worldly or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Corrupt affections.</note> 
                  <hi>ſelf-intereſt;</hi> This will keep us from being convinced, though Angels ſhould come and preach to us. Thus the Phariſees they were moved by ſelf-reſpects, if they ſhould yeeld to Chriſt, their applauſe, their gain would quickly periſh. And no doubt ſuch clay as this lieth upon the eyes of many men, that ſeeing, they do not ſee; knowing, they will not be convinced.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Mistake about the nature and way of godlineſſe, may keep many off from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Miſtake about the way and nature of godlineſs.</note> 
                  <hi>convinced.</hi> I ſhall inſtance only in two principles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When men do judge nothing <hi>Godlineſſe, but what is exactly perfect:</hi> And therefore if they ſee Miniſters or Chriſtians ſubject to any infirmities, this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens them in their impieties, they ſee ſuch men have failings. If this were a good principle, no godly man in the world (except Chriſt, <hi>in whom all fulneſſe did dwell)</hi> had a convincing life. Was there any Prophet, or an Apoſtle that had not ſome failings, that did not pray for the pardon of ſinne; <hi>If we ſay we have no ſinne</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> in the name of the moſt holy) <hi>we deceive our ſelves, and have no truth in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another falſe principle that keepeth from convincing, is, <hi>When we thinke godlineſs lieth in the actual abdication and renouncing of all earthly, worldly things.</hi> It is true, in our afflictions we are to have theſe things, as if we had them not. There is to be an habitual preparation of heart, to leave all, when Chriſt ſhall command. It is true, <hi>We cannot ſerve God and Mammon;</hi> the love of the Father, and the love of the world cannot conſiſt together; but the love of God, and the uſe and poſſeſſion of theſe things may. Now by this errour many Papiſts are not convinced of the holineſs that is in reformed Churches. Why ſo? Oh, ſay they, you have no Monaſteries; you have no publick places for religious perſons; you have no votaries, that part with their earthly ſubſtance, and vow a life of poverty, your Miniſters marry, and have children. Thus the Papiſt is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, becauſe he miſtaketh about godlineſs; and not only they, but many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded perſons amongſt us, are offended, becauſe Miniſters take maintenance, provide for their families; as if this were againſt godlineſs, whereas the neglect of this would be to offend to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation, to all Miniſters and private Christians, to ſtudy for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing lives.</hi> The more power and conviction is therein, the greater is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honoured, the more is God glorified; the eaſier is the converſion of others, and the more is the mouth of prophane men ſtopped. Conſider not only what is lawfull, but what is convincing; eſpecially take heed of ſuch actions, or a life that is the contrary; ſcandalizing, offending, and cauſing Religion to be the worſe thought of by thy means.</p>

I hope, by the aſſistance of God, always to keep up this integrity of life.</hi> Others underſtand it of the <hi>Corinthians, I hope as you doe acknowledge us, ſo not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the calumnies and ſubtil endeavours of the falſe Apostles to draw you away from me, yet you will perſevere and continue in your right judgement concerning me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may very well take in both together; for the latter doth neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the former; they could not continue in their acknowledgement of his integrity, unleſſe <hi>Paul</hi> alſo did perſiſt in his uprightneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now in that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He truſteth</hi> (viz.) <hi>in God,</hi> that he ſhall be thus preſerved: you ſee the humble and holy frame of his heart; he doth not put confidence in his own ſtrength, in his own gifts and graces, but alone in God; which might teach us, <hi>That though never ſo godly, yet we are to depend upon God alone for our perſeverance in the way to Heaven.</hi> But we have already ſpoken to this in the general, <hi>That it's the property of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to acknowledge the grace of God towards them in all things.</hi> We ſhall

Now this falleth out too often very ſadly in our courſe of Chriſtianity; many that were once firſt, are now laſt: Yea are now nothing at all, but turned clear out of the narrow way, into the broad way that leadeth to Hell and deſtruction. Thus the Apoſtle upbraideth the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Galat. 3. 3. <hi>For ginning in the Spirit, and ending in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And again, it is extreame folly, <hi>becauſe we part with God for ſinne;</hi> with Heaven for Hell, with honey for gall; we loſe our ſweetneſſe and fatneſſe, to become briars and brambles, that are fit for nothing but to be burnt.</p>
               <p>To enlarge this, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That a man who doth firſt ſet upon the way of Religion, who will</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. A man that would ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an holy life, muſt firſt look to his foundation.</note> 
                  <hi>become a Diſciple of Chriſt, muſt above all things look to his foundation well.</hi> He muſt have a ſpecial care that he layeth a good beginning, otherwiſe though he may make a glorious ſhew for a while, his fall at laſt will be very great and terrible. Therefore our Saviour knowing the hypocriſie and inconſtancy of mans heart, doth much preſſe this point, and that to ſuch hearers, who did ſhew exceeding great zeal and forwardneſſe in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after him. witneſſe the Parable of the ſeveral kinds of grounds that received the good ſeed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and <hi>Luke</hi> 8. The difference between the good and bad lay in this, that one had a good and honeſt heart, wherein the word of God had deep rooting; The other had onely a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial worke, and therefore when hardſhip came, could not endure. So likewiſe the Parable of the <hi>fooliſh and wiſe builders,</hi> Luke 6. 47. is expreſly to this purpoſe, that none ſhould pleaſe themſelves in hearing of the Word, in publick duties and profeſſion; but look to their <hi>foundation,</hi> to obſerve what all their duties and expreſſions are built upon. For what is built on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a Rock will endure, when ſtormes and tempeſts ſhall ariſe. It is neceſſary to inſtance in ſome of thoſe particulars that will thus qualifie our beginnings. For as in diſeaſes, yea and in ſinnes, the Rule is, <hi>To looke to the beginnings;</hi> So in another ſenſe, it is good counſel to obſerve, what was the firſt beginning that ever brought you into the wayes of God. How came you to leave off what was formerly done by you, and to appear in a contrary way? For in ſome ſenſe we may ſay here, not <hi>dimidium,</hi> but <hi>principium eſt plus toto.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We are to look to our motives,</hi> whether they were <hi>temporal, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> upon ſome outward advantages; or whether <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> Chriſt had many followers, becauſe of the loaves. There are many that know Chriſt after the fleſh; that come with the petition of <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s children, <hi>Grant that we may ſit in thy Kingdome, one on the right hand, and another on the left,</hi> thinking Chriſts Kingdome would be outward and glorious. Now ſuch as theſe will never continue: It is but painting, and near the fire it will melt: It is but the morning-dew, when the Sunne ariſeth it will vaniſh away. Oh
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:48709:243"/>
then above all things look to thy <hi>motives!</hi> Conſider what it was that brought thee off from thy former wayes? Was it from beholding a ſpiritual excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in Chriſt and holy things? Was it for godlineſſe ſake? Then becauſe Chriſt is the ſame, and godlineſſe is the ſame, thou wilt alſo be the ſame; but if to get the favour of men, to get wealth, to obtaine paces of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and profit, then thou art but a meteor compounded of terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial materials, and ſo wilt be toſſed up and down, as any winde driveth thee.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing neceſſary to look to in thy beginnings, is to ſee, <hi>That the workings of Gods Spirit make impreſſions deep enough, that it have full root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> For <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. and in many other places, we read of many common gifts of Gods Spirit beſtowed upon men, whereby they may make very hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beginnings; they may be furniſhed with excellent gifts and abilities, ſo as to be able to work miracles; they may taſte of the good word of God, they may be enlightned, they may believe, they may receive the Word with joy; and are not theſe great and rare things? How few are there that attain to thus much? They have not that common illumination, nor thoſe tranſitory affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby we may ſay, they do for a ſeaſon rejoyce in the light. When therefore we begin to take the firſt ſtep to Heaven, we are to conſider whether we have any more than the common breathings and inſpirations of Gods Spirit, whether we have more than gifts or abilities, more than ſome bodily raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or extaſies. For all theſe do not neceſſarily inferre the new creature, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a divine nature within us. Indeed we could not have theſe things without the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit; and therefore when carnal and natural men are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of theſe, they admire them, they take theſe for grace, they never had ſuch workings upon their ſouls before; there is a vaſt difference in themſelves, as they find, between what they were once, and what they now feel; and this maketh them very ſecure and confident; but becauſe <hi>a good foundation,</hi> was not at firſt laid, therefore many of ſuch a frame of ſpirit going no further, do greatly apoſtatize, and are more taken with their opinions, experiences and apprehenſions, than Chriſt dwelling in them; they are affected with them, and not renouncing all, go out of every thing, that Chriſt may be exalted, and they debaſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And I will inſtance in no more, <hi>It behoveth thoſe who are beginners in Chriſtianity, deliberately and ſeriouſly to conſider how much it will c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> be godly.</hi> They are not only to look to their motives, but to the nature of ſuch duties as they muſt be continually exerciſed in. For when a man findeth that the way of godlineſs is a more ſelf-denying, mortified way, a more oppoſed and perſecuted way than he expected; this maketh him to be offended, and he is ready with <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt for a piece of ſilver; or with <hi>Eſau,</hi> to ſell his birth-right for a meſs of pottage. Our Saviour ſpeaketh fully to this, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28, 29, 31, 32. where preſſing thoſe who are to be his Diſciples to theſe great and difficult duties of hating father and mother, and life it ſelf for him; Yea to take up his croſs, and to follow him: No more for ever to own any object, as the chiefeſt delight of his ſoul, but Chriſt; he illuſtrateth this by two ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, one of a <hi>builder,</hi> who if he be wiſe, will conſider what expences he is able to bear, before he ſetteth upon it, leſt his folly be known to all: And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a <hi>King going to warre,</hi> who will firſt conſider what his ſtrength is; and whether he be able to meet his adverſary or no. Thus it ought to be with every one that will profeſs the name of Chriſt: How come you to to do it? Have you ſeriouſly conſidered what it is to be a Chriſtian indeed? Can you hate all, leave all, if Chriſt require? Can you part with your luſts, your pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? If you could have theſe, and Chriſt too, then the way to Heaven would not be ſo difficult, then many would be ſaved. But this is that which maketh
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:48709:243"/>
ſo many apoſtaſies, ſo many revoltings and ſcandals in the way of Religion, that men come on a ſudden into the profeſſion of Chriſt, either for education only, or the national example, or ſome external encouragements; and then when they meet with harder brunts than they looked for; when they ſee Chriſt will have them to be godly in good earneſt, to be ſelf-denying indeed, elſe they ſhall not be owned by him, then they diſcover [that <hi>Inſipientis eſt dicere, non putabam,]</hi> the language of the unwiſe, I did not look for this, I will go back into <hi>Aegypt</hi> again, rather than endure in this wilderneſs. Thus you ſee that a mans begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in Religion is all in all: It is not ſo much to ask, Doth he pray, doth he hear, doth he walk otherwiſe then he did? But what was the cauſe of this? How cometh it about that he doth ſo?</p>
               <p>Hence the ſecond particular to clear this truth is, <hi>That true, ſolid, and ſincere</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Sincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings are the cauſe of perſeverance.</note> 
                  <hi>beginnings are the cauſe of our perſeverance and continuance in what is holy.</hi> Whereſoever a principle of ſupernatural life is infuſed, <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God;</hi> The man who hath the fear of God put into his inward parts, this man will be preſerved, that nothing ſhall either totally or finally ſeparate that ſoul and Chriſt: So that good and true beginnings, will be ſure to have holy and comfortable endings. That place ſhall ſuffice for the preſent, <hi>John 10. 27, 28, 29, 30. My ſheep hear my voice,—and I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand,</hi> &amp;c. To ſay they may by their own negligence throw themſelves out of Gods hand, is to thwart the comfort intended there for true believers. For if the Devil, or wicked men could not make them to periſh, yet if they ſhould do it themſelves, if the grace of God did not keep back their own corrupt inclinations, as well as keep off the Devil, they ſhould remain in continual perplexing fears and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. Where then the foundation-ſtones of this ſpiritual building are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſoundly laid, there no tempeſts can wholly overwhelm, though they may cauſe terrible ſhakings; and therefore perſeverance is not the condition upon which the truth of grace depends, but it is the effect of it; that is, we are not to ſay (as <hi>Arminians</hi> do) If you perſevere in believing, if you continue in loving of God, then this will make your grace effectual; then this will make you to be ſincere and not hypocrites. For if ſo, then till we die, we cannot have any true ground of comfort, becauſe we know not how irrecoverably we may fall off from Chriſt, before that time come. And this is to thwart the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral torrent of the Scripture, who calleth upon the people of God, <hi>To rejoyce, and to have peace with God, as a Father; and to encourage our ſelves from the preſent ſtate of grace we are in, ſo that we ſhall never be deprived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Perſeverance then doth not make our grace to be true, but true grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us to perſevere, as the wheel runneth round (which is <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) not that it may be round, but becauſe it is round. It is true, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Iohn 8. 31. If ye continue in my Word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed;</hi> not that this made them ſo, but becauſe this would declare and manifeſt them to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore it is not enough for the grace of God once to put us into</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Therefore the grace of God is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to begin, but alſo to continue holineſs in us.</note> 
                  <hi>a ſtate of holineſſe, and then to leave us to our ſelves; but it is neceſſary that we ſhould have his conſtant quickning grace, to enable us to hold out to the end.</hi> Chriſt is not only the <hi>Author,</hi> but the <hi>finiſher of our faith,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. And therefore we have the godly ſo often praying, that God would keep them, that he would teach them, that he would increaſe their ſaith, that he would not lead them into temptation; which neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that the ſame grace of God, which began the foundation, muſt alſo build up all, and finiſh whatſoever is begun. It is not then from our ſelves, or from the nature of grace, as if it were not amiſſible: <hi>Adam,</hi> and the apoſtate Angels are a clear inſtance to the contrary; but from the aſſiſtance and help of Chriſt without us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:48709:244"/>
Laſtly, <hi>Though perſeverance to the end be thus the promiſed effect of Gods grace, yet that doth not exclude, but include an holy fear, loſt we that ſtand</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, doth not exclude, but include fear, watchfulneſſe, and diligence.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould fall; a diligent working out of our ſalvation with fear and trembling; a conſtant watching over our hearts, and a daily keeping down of our body, leſt after we have appeared ſo long in the wayes of Chriſt, we afterwards turne aſide into the Devils paths.</hi> For there are ſad inſtances in Scripture of ſuch, who in outward appearance were eminent in the Church of God (as <hi>Judas</hi> was) but having not a ſure bottome, and neglecting ſuch means, which Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, they became ſad ſcandals in the Church of God, for their fall was great.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation, Not to reſt upon what we have been.</hi> What though ſo many years thou haſt appeared a Diſciple of Chriſt? For if the foundation was not well laid at firſt, one time or other there will be a breaking upon thee. What moved thee, what prevailed over thee to become a Diſciple of Chriſt at firſt, and be moved hereunto? becauſe if thou continueſt not in the good way thou didſt begin in,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thy revoltings will do more hurt, then ever thy hopefull beginnings will do good.</hi> Thy later end will more offend God, more ſcandalize Religion, than ever thy former zeal could exalt it. Oh what a ſad thing is it to be a deſtroyer of what thou didſt once build up!</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Remember the folly</hi> (as you heard) <hi>that is in doing ſo. For godlineſſe is the ſame, Chriſt is the ſame, Heaven is as good as it was at firſt:</hi> Why then ſhould it not be ſo to thee? What art thou weary of gold for droſſe and dirt?

               <p>THe former part of this verſe containeth a reaſon, why his hope is ſo ſtedfaſt concerning their perſeverance in acknowledgement of him, <hi>viz.</hi> from what hath been paſt, what they have done already, they had acknowledged him, and therefore hopeth they will. Hence <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> readeth this paſſage, before the laſt clauſe in the former verſe: He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thoſe words <hi>[I truſt you ſhall acknowledge even to the end]</hi> to follow theſe words. But why doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>You have acknowledged us in part? Chryſoſtom</hi> attributeth it to his modeſty and humility. For being to ſay, <hi>That they did acknowledg him to be their rejoycing:</hi> Leſt this ſhould ſeem pride and arrogancy, he addeth, <hi>in part.</hi> Others as <hi>Grotius</hi> relateth it to the perſons acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, in this ſenſe, that <hi>part of them, ſome of them</hi> did ſo. They were not all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the deluſions of talſe Apoſtles: Some did keep their integrity and ſound judgement. And thus it is uſed, <hi>Rom. 11. 18. Hardneſſe of heart is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in part to Iſrael,</hi> which is not to be underſtood of the hardneſſe of heart, for the <hi>Jews</hi> were wholly delivered up to that; but of part of them, yea the farre greater part; yet ſomes <hi>Jews</hi> were converted, and did believe in Chriſt; but it is far more probable to interpret it of the <hi>acknowledgement</hi> it ſelf. Though they did not ſo fully as at firſt acknowledge him, yet ſince his former Epiſtle to them, and diligent information of them, they began in ſome meaſure to recover out of their errour, and ſo in part entertained better thoughts of him, than before. So that it is like that expreſſion, <hi>I know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. though there it be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or rather like that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath not grieved me, but in part;</hi> and <hi>Rom. 15. 15. I have written more boldly to you in part;</hi> and <hi>Rom. 15. 24. That I may in part be filled with you;</hi> in which places it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This expreſſion then doth not relate to the firſt time of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> acknowledgement of <hi>Paul,</hi> which was in their converſion from their <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> for then they did wholly and univerſally receive him; but to the time of their repentance and recovery out of thoſe decayes in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards him, which by the falſe Apoſtles had been procured, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſomething awakened, they ſaw they had fooliſhly given ear to other teachers; and now being thus in their recovery, <hi>Paul</hi> to encourage them that they may <hi>acknowledge him,</hi>

<pb n="464" facs="tcp:48709:245"/>
not <hi>in part</hi> only, doth take notice of this acknowledgement. We ſee then here the inconſtancy and unſetledneſs of theſe <hi>Corinthians;</hi> at firſt none but <hi>Paul;</hi> he was their father, afterwards through the eloquence and humane perſwaſions of falſe teachers, they began to deſpiſe <hi>Paul,</hi> to leave him, to admire others. But when <hi>Paul</hi> by his Epiſtle had ſeverely and throughly dealt with them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them of ſeveral errours and vices that were amongſt them, then they begin to apply themſelves to him again; and this indeed was the good hand of God, that they did not wholly apoſtatize, but their withering love to <hi>Paul</hi> did begin to flouriſh again. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the beſt Churches are full of mutability and changeableneſſes, of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What fault could theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> find with <hi>Paul?</hi> Was he not the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument uſed by God to bring them out of that miſerable darkneſs they ſat in? Did not they find the mighty power of God going along with his miniſterial la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Did not their own experience inform them of the great good they had got by him? Yet we ſee that afterwards the plauſible eloquence and ſubtil crafty inſinuations of falſe teachers had brought <hi>Paul</hi> wholly out of requeſt, he was contemprible. They began to queſtion his Apoſtleſhip, and to argue againſt his office. Thus you ſee what levity and fickleneſs may be even in good men. This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s caſe with other Churches likewiſe, which maketh him ſo apologeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal in commending his office and call, becauſe they compelled him thereunto, he was forced thereunto; it was not his own credit and glory that he ſtood upon; he could be contented to be deſpiſed by them; but his Office he was bound to vindicate. For this was for their own good, their own ſouls might periſh, if they miſcarried herein. Let us inſtance onely in the Church of the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Paul</hi> is put to an amazement about them, <hi>Galatians 1. 4. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile you are ſo ſoone removed from him that called you, unto another Gospel. So ſoon removed.]</hi> How quickly may falſe teachers demoliſh that which the faithfull Officers of Chriſt have been many years with much zeal and diligence building up? Tares ſown by envious perſons will quickly come and overgrow the wheat. Hereupon <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. he ſheweth their folly by many convincing and piercing arguments in falling off thus from him; and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 15. puts them in mind, that they had other thoughts of him once. <hi>Paul</hi> was once a bleſſed man, and his preaching bleſſed preaching; Where is the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you once ſpake of? Yea he ſaith, their affections were ſo vehement and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical, <hi>That they would have pluckt out their eyes</hi> (their deareſt and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt part) <hi>and have given them him, if this could have done him good:</hi> yet how quickly did theſe boiling affections turn into ice? They will receive other mens doctrines rather than his. And if we ſee the Apoſtles of Chriſt that had their call immediately from him, that were furniſhed with a large meaſure of the Spirit, and inabled to do ſuch wonderfull miracles before their eyes, may come to be contemned and vilified, and that by their own people, who had once ſo highly honoured them: No wonder if ordinary Paſtors and Officers do oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en meet with ſuch entertainment in the world. Yea, was it not thus with Chriſt himſelf? Did not he find the groſſe mutability of the people, when one while they honour him, crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and at another time, <hi>Crucifie him?</hi> If they do thus to the <hi>green tree,</hi> will they not much rather to the <hi>dry?</hi> And ſhall <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be above his maſter?</hi>

               <p>To inlarge this, Conſider, <note place="margin">1. It is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours to be mutable to their inferiours</note>

nature. Is not this plain in <hi>Moſes?</hi> What a faithfull Governour had he been to the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> like a tender father, he even carried them in his arms; God had honoured him exceedingly before their eyes, working many miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous mercies for them by his means; yet how often did they murmure againſt him? which was a great ſinne, becauſe as <hi>Moſes</hi> telleth them, <hi>Exod. 16. 8. Your murmurings are not againſt us, but the Lord.</hi> Yea they are ready to fall off from <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to make themſelves a Captain, that they may go again into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Thus the people alſo dealt with <hi>David,</hi> when they were in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit for the loſſe of their wives, they ſpake of ſtoning <hi>David.</hi> Among the <hi>Heathens</hi> there are plentifull examples of this unthankfull mutability; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> with others; which made the latter ſay, when they had caſt him off, after all the good ſervice he had none for them, <hi>That they did with him, as beaſts doe, in a ſtorm runne to a tree to ſhelter themſelves, and when that is over, they fall a browzing on it, and breaking the boughs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> How many of their famous Worthies have the <hi>Heathens</hi> baniſhed moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully, and then in their neceſſities intreated them to come again? Which made one wiſe <hi>Roman</hi> ſay, when perſwaded to enter upon ſome publick deſign for the common good, but dangerous, deny, ſaying, <hi>Why ſhould wiſe men venture themſelves for fools?</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> were impetuous to put <hi>Socrates</hi> to death, and after he was dead, then they were grieved and impatient, till they had deſtroyed thoſe that were the Authors of it. Now if it be thus in civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, no wonder if there be more changeableneſs, and more ingratitude in Church-matters. For in the faithfull diſcharge of our ſpiritual office, there we directly oppoſe the natural inclination and love of men to their ſinfull pleaſures; we deal chiefly with the inward man, and the matter we propound for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it to be believed, is wholly tranſcendent to their humane apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the goodneſs of it is altogether ſupernatural; Yea contra-natural, take man in his ſinfull naturals. Hence it is that ſpiritual governing is far more difficult than civil; men being more willing to receive what maketh for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily good and welfare, then for their ſouls and ſpiritual eſtate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This inclination to changeableneſſe and mutability in matters of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. This incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to this changeablenes hath more temptations in great than ſmall places.</note> 
                  <hi>Religion, hath greater temptations in rich and famous Cities, than in villages and ſmall parochial places.</hi> Now <hi>Corinth</hi> (as you heard) was a famous and rich City, eminent for trading, yea and for earning and gifts. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> doth in none of his Epiſtles, ſo much debaſe the wiſdome of the world, indeavouring to exalt Chriſt above all things, as in his Epiſtles to theſe <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and it ſeemeth they did a bound with many excellent gifts and abilities, as the Apoſtle many times witneſſeth. Now this was their ſnare and temptation; this made them proud of their knowledge; this made them admire gifts more than grace; this cauſed them to make parties and factions; ſome cried up one teacher, ſome another: So that their wealth and gifts did prove a great temptation to them; and by this means <hi>Paul</hi> came to be undervalued. Thus it falleth out many times in great and populous places, where are variety of Miniſters, and of gifts, and a people raiſed up in knowledge and wealth; it is very hard for them to keep in a conſtant, real eſteem of ſound and ſoul-ſaving truths; but with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be weary of <hi>Manna,</hi> to deſire even <hi>garlick</hi> and <hi>onyons</hi> above it. The Goſpel was at firſt preached and planted in Cities, and their Churches were firſt conſtituted, it being a long time ere the little villages in the Countrey did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Chriſtian faith. Hence to this day (ſay ſome) we call Heathens <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, à pagis,</hi> from <hi>villages,</hi> becauſe they did laſt of all receive the Chriſtian faith. But then they have this advantage, that they are freed from thoſe many temptations that are in the Churches of Cities; for they having not many Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, nor hearing variety of gifts, are not ſo tempted to be alwayes luſting after ſome new thing, as in the fore-mentioned places; yet for all this they have the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:48709:246"/>
ſame corrupt inclination; and if they have not the temptation brought to them, they will ſeek out for the temptations: and hence many villages are quickly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with corrupt and erroneous wayes. For the <hi>Devil he goeth up and down roaring, to ſeek whom he may devour,</hi> whether in Cities or villages.</p>
               <p>Now let us conſider of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> which make ſuch a change and alteration, <note place="margin">What are the cauſes of this changeablenes</note> and that many times in thoſe who are very good, or at leaſt apparently ſo. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This ariſeth from the fickleneſſe and inconſtancy that is in many men.</hi> There are few that profeſs Religion, that do obtain to a ſound mind, that are well <note place="margin">1. Inconſtancy and fickleneſs.</note> rooted in the firſt principles of Religion; They content themſelves with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and confuſed apprehenſions, and therefore can ſpeak of thoſe things, which yet they have no clear underſtanding about. Now how can ſuch ſtraws and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as theſe, but be blown away with every wind of doctrine? It is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles expreſſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14. implying, that it is childiſhneſs, levity, want of a ſerious, weighty and ſolid judgement, that maketh us leave the faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God, and greedily run after falſe teachers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>An overhaſty and unadviſed receiving of the Miniſters of the Gospel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we well conſider what we do.</hi> For thou who receiveſt a man to be the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor <note place="margin">2. An overha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty receiving of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> of thy ſoul, thou muſt not look that he ſhould come down to thee, but thou to him: I mean, you muſt not expect that he ſhould comply with you in your luſts, in your ſinnes, in your ſuperſtitions. But on the contrary, that you will readily ſubmit to whatſoever he ſhall from the word of God make known to you. It is unreaſonable to look that a Miniſter ſhould go from his Commiſſion; he hath not a magiſterial, but miniſterial Authority; he cannot make virtue, vice; or vice, virtue; he cannot make the way to Heaven broader than it is; he may not diſpenſe Ordinances, otherwiſe than according to the order of Chriſt: and if ſo, judge whether is more reaſonable, that you yeild your ſelves to Chriſts commands, or we comply with your unlawfull wayes? Certainly we cannot come off to your principles; we ſhall be damned, if we do. <hi>If I pleaſe men (viz.</hi> in ſinfull things) <hi>I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1. 10. ſaid <hi>Paul.</hi> And we muſt with <hi>Elihu</hi> profeſs, <hi>Job 32. 21, 22. We know not to give flattering titles, in ſo doing God our maker would ſoon take us away.</hi> If it be thus with us, that we are bound up; and you on the contrary are commanded to come out of all evil wayes, and receive the good word of God from out hands, then it ought not to be any offence or ſtaggering unto you, if you find us out of Gods word, enjoyning thoſe things which the corrupt nature of man is againſt. But this many times maketh a great change in a people; they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that the Miniſters of God ſhould comply with their ends, their luſts, and then they would never alter their affections from them; but when it proveth otherwiſe, then they did never ſo much advance and exalt, as they will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards condemn and vilifie. This was plain in <hi>John</hi>'s hearers; his ſtrict life and unuſual converſation made them come into the wilderneſs to ſee him; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to ſee ſuch a Prophet that was of their own, and therefore they flocked after him, <hi>John 5. 35. They did for a while rejoyce in his light;</hi> but when they ſaw he gave teſtimony to Chriſt, and would not be a Prophet to ſerve their ends, then they railed on him, and ſaid, <hi>He had a Devil.</hi>

Chap. 2. <hi>That he doth rejoyce in beholding their order, and faith in Chriſt,</hi> To meet with a people that are neither ignorant, heretical, nor prophane, but willing to walk according to Chriſts rule, and his order; this is to ſee heaven upon earth: The Apoſtle findeth ſuch matter of joy, not onely in thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but in many other Churches; For as he had more Labours, more Oppoſitions, more Perſecutions than others, ſo alſo God gave him more joy and comefort in beholding the ſpiritual ſucceſſe of his Labours; for this was the onely comefort of his ſpiritual heart, to ſee men imbrace Chriſt, and to live worthy of the Goſpel, it was not his own Glory, Honor, and greatneſs, that he aymed at; which is an excellent example to us Miniſters of the Goſpel, that our Matter of joy ſhould not be any earthly riches, or wealth, any great fame, or worldly eſteem, but that we are to win people to Chriſt alone, not our ſelves; Thus the Apoſtle calleth the <hi>Philipians his joy and crown,</hi> Phil. 4. 1. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 19, 20. ſpeaking of his ardent affections to ſee their face, by way of interrogation, the more emphatically to expreſs himſelf, he ſaith, <hi>What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing?

Theſe Relations are reſpectively for ſupernatural and ſpiritual ends, and effects: The Miniſter is for illumination, Converſion, Edification; for the deſtroying of the power and Kingdome of Satan, as alſo the eſtabliſhing and promoting the Kingdome of grace in the hearts of the people: The people alſo, they are to be matter of encouragement to him; they are to be helpfull and aſſiſtant in their way, that Godlineſs may flouriſh, that the ends of the Miniſtry may not be fruſtrated. The Apoſtle ſometimes taketh notice of the great uſefulneſs, and ſerviceableneſs even of ſome women in that kinde; For, though Miniſters be compared to Light, to the Sun, and Starrs, yet in this there is a difference. The Starrs give Light and Influence into theſe ſublunary things, but receive no benefit at all from them again; but the Miniſters of the Church, even though as eminent as <hi>Paul;</hi> yet they acknowledg the manifold benefits, and that in a ſpiritual way, which they may receive from their people again: now then, how happy is it when there is a reciprocal and circular helping of each other, when ſpiritual guides do convert, edifie, and quicken up their people; and again the people do aſſiſt, help, and quicken up their Officers; certainly, as ſpiritual delights are greater than any bodily ones, becauſe the objects are more excellent and uſefull; ſo ſhould this mutual rejoycing in our ſpiritual joy ſurpaſs all the delight that we take in our natural and civil relation, neither the delight of a Wife in her Husband, or of a Childe in his Father, ſhould be
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:48709:248"/>
equal to the joy of a people in Faithfull Officers: And ſo, <hi>è contra;</hi> the Reaſon is evident, becauſe the effects of this Relation are ſpiritual, heavenly, and ſo infinitely tranſcending all earthly comeforts; and therefore ſuch who find no matter of rejoycing herein, it is becauſe they are carnal, ſenſual; they abide under the Dominion of their luſts, they never found the Miniſtry ſpiritual and powerfull to them; They never had the experience of the bleſſed effects thereof upon their hearts, and then, How can they rejoyce in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Seing that this mutual aſſiſtance is appointed by God as a ſpecial means to deſtroy the Kingdome of Satan: Hence it is, that he doth moſt aſſault this</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Therefore doth the Devil endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Miniſter and beople.</note> 
                  <hi>indeavouring to make diſcords, and differences between Miniſter, and people,</hi> That ſo both the benefit and comefort of ſuch unity might be fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Devil delights to ſow his Tares in every field; therefore in civil eſtates, in domeſtical relations, he throweth his Firebrands, and loveth to ſee all in Paſſions, and diſcontents; but eſpecially his deſign is againſt thoſe ſpiritual relations, becauſe the well mannaging of them doth more immediately oppoſe his throne of darkneſs. For this end he ſtirred up ſo many falſ Prophets and Teachers, whoſe works was to divide between the people and their faithfull guides. And can we think, the Apoſtles would have written ſo Apologetically in many places, condeſcended ſo much in the wayes of Humility, and diligence, to win their affections, but that he knew by ſuch Diſſentions, the Devil would inlarge his Dominions? Hence it is, that <hi>Calvin</hi> upon that place of 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. Leſt ſatan ſhould get an advantage of us,</hi> though he take notice of their expoſition, who refer it to the Inceſtuous perſon; as if Satans deſigne was upon that occaſion to have him ſwallowed up with exceſſive ſorrow, yet he doth in a great part relate it, to the Diſſention that the Devil endeavoured to make between them and <hi>Paul:</hi> for if <hi>Paul</hi> was for the confirming of their love to that perſon now repenting; but the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> under a pretence of zeal againſt ſin, ſhould be againſt him: This would have cauſed ſad Diviſions, and ſo thereby Satan would have prevailed. It is obſerved, as one of <hi>Julians</hi> deviliſh deſignes againſt Chriſtianity, to make a difference between the Chriſtians and their godly Paſtors; and therefore he did craftily and ſecretly pour all the oyl he could into ſuch flames, to make them greater: and truly the Inſtances of ſuch differences, even in the Reformed Churches do give too full a teſtimony of the Devils labour herein. Should we ſpeak of the Churches troubles at <hi>Franckford,</hi> though exiled, and under Perſecution, The ſharpeſt whereof was between the Flock and their Shepherd; yea, of the hot contention between <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and in many other Churches, we may eaſily be perſwaded, that there is ſcarce any one thing, wherein the Devil goeth more about as a roaring Lyon to deceive them, than to break the ſlaves of beauty, and bands between Shepherd and Sheep, which ſhould make both Miniſter and people the more watchfull and diligent; and alſo much in Prayer, that God would diſapoint all ſuch purpoſes of <hi>Satan,</hi> and his Inſtruments. This may ſuffice in the General.</p>
               <p>Let us now proceed to the reſpective particulars: and firſt, <note place="margin">How and why may a people rejoyce in their Paſtor. 1. As the inſtruments whereby God hath inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In what ſence, and how a people may rejoyce in their faithfull Guides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>They are to rejoye in them as thoſe inſtruments which God hath uſed to bring ſpiritual light unto their minde, and heavenly heat into their heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this it is the Apoſtle doth ſo much inſiſt upon, to convince the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> That if ever they did believe, if ever they felt any thing of the ſaving efficacy of Gods ſpirit upon their hearts, it was by his Miniſtry; and therefore they would be unthankfull to God, if they did not take notice of Gods ſpecial bleſſing to them by his means. It is true, 1 Cor. 3. we ſee there the Apoſtle zealouſly beating down their factions and Contentions, which they raiſed by ſetting up one Officer, and Teacher to the deſpiſing of another; and thereupon
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:48709:248"/>
exalteth Chriſt onely: But yet, though Chriſt be the principal only, and he alone giveth the encreaſe, yet he granteth the Neceſſity of the Miniſtry withall; <hi>Paul</hi> muſt Plant, <hi>Apollo</hi> muſt water, and theſe are Ministers by whom they believed, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. Although then it be our duty to lift up our hearts to God alone, as he in whom and by whom all ſpiritual ſucceſs doth ariſe to us; yet we are to rejoyce in ſuch inſtruments as God uſeth. For if we may be glad of ſuch Inſtruments that cauſe our temporall comforts and ſupports: If the Childe may rejoyce in the father, if an indigent man in him who is potent, and bountifull; no wonder then, if we do cry out, <hi>How welcome are the feet of thoſe who bring glad tydings of peace,</hi> Rom. 10. 15. <hi>How beautiful are the very feet of ſuch?</hi> So that it plainly demonſtrateth all ſuch to be delivered up to the ſpirit of ſlumber and prophaneneſs, or of Error and Hereſie, who do not find this cauſe to rejoyce in them, as Gods Inſtruments to their Soules.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We are to rejoyce in them becauſe of their works ſake, and the Faithfull</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. For their works ſake.</note> 
                  <hi>diſcharge of their duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the more powerfull they are herein, the greater ought our joy to be; Thus the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 1. Let a man account of us as the Embaſſadours of God, and Stewards of Chriſt.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle alſo commandeth 1 <hi>Theſſal. 11. 13. To eſteem very highly of thoſe who are over them, and admoniſh them, and that for their works ſake.</hi> Though they do admoniſh and reprove you, which is as unpleaſing to a ſin, as ſalt to a ſore; yet you are to eſteem highly of them, This requireth not onely external reſpect, but cordial and Internal, and this muſt be <hi>for their works ſake.</hi> Many times a people may glory in the Abilities, in the Learning and admirable gifts of their Teachers, thinking that thereby they ſurpaſs other Congregations; This is a vain-glorious thing, too often ſeen in great Cities; but the Apoſtle ſaith, it muſt be <hi>for their works ſake,</hi> becauſe they do faithfully and powerfully lead you into the paths of Eternal Life. Thus, as <hi>David</hi> eſteemed the <hi>word of God above gold and ſilver,</hi> becauſe thereby he was <hi>forewarned from ſin;</hi> The ſpiritual, and holy commands of God not induring any ſin, made him thus in love with it; So it ſhould alſo be with our people, they ſhould delight and rejoyce in the Miniſtry, becauſe it is efficacious againſt ſin, becauſe it enlighteneth, it converteth, it deſtroyeth the works of the Devil; ſo that this particular diſcovers the Prophaneneſſe and impiety of ſuch men, who rejoyce moſt in ſuch Miniſters as are either lazy and negligent, or that are diſſolute, and carnally humouring men in their evil wayes: Theſe they boaſt in, and rejoyce in; they account none like them. Thus God of old complained of the people of Iſrael, that they loved ſuch who did ſow pillowes under their armes, and encouraged the hearts of thoſe that were wicked; <hi>but made thoſe ſad, whom the Lord would not have made ſad,</hi> Ezek. 13. 10, 22. How miſerable are ſuch a people who rejoyce in the greateſt judgment that can befall them? Rejoyce not in this, but weep and mourn rather, when thoſe who ſhould deal faithfully with thee, do flatter and ſeduce thee, daubing with untempered morter: For God will deſtroy both ſuch Prophets and ſuch a People.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>We are to rejoyce in the ſpiritual ſucceſs and proſperity of their work.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In the ſpiritual ſucceſs of the Miniſter.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is very ſad to hear thoſe complaints in the Scripture, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> and <hi>All the day long have we ſtretched out our hands unto a rebellious people:</hi> To have much rain fall upon the ground, and nothing but bryars and thorns coming up thereupon. When therefore we ſhall finde that God makes the Miniſtry a ſavour of life, and not of death, unto many; this ought greatly to rejoyce us, when thou findeſt it to be a mighty word upon thy own heart, or upon the hearts of others, wherein we ought to be exceeding glad. For, Is there any greater mercy can befall thee, than to have the Word thus a converting and ſaving Word to thee? Thou mayeſt admire thy Pleaſures, thy
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:48709:249"/>
profit, thy luſts, and judg them ſweet; But know, that the Saving efficacy of the Miniſtry upon thy ſoul will be the bleſſedneſs indeed that ſhall endure for ever; and therefore, when you hear men praiſe a Miniſtry, admire that; examine what is the ſpiritual good they have found thereby, what Reformation, what a change hath it made? The Apoſtle telleth theſe very <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 5. 6. that their glorying was not good:</hi> why ſo? <hi>becauſe they did not purge out the old leaven:</hi> They did not caſt out that wicked perſon from amongſt them; now all this while they gloryed in their able Teachers, they magnified the wiſdome and Eloquence of many that preached amongſt them; but ſaith he, <hi>your glorying is not good:</hi> where is the holy Order, the godly Diſcipline, the ſpirituall Reformation, that you ſhould have attained unto by the Gifts and Miniſtry of your Teachers? This alone will cauſe us truly and ſolidly to rejoyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Instruction:</hi> How impoſſible is it for men upon true and ſpiritual grounds to rejoyce in the Miniſtry, unleſs they have felt ſome ſpecial efficacy upon it in their hearts? They may glory in the parts, in the Eloquence, in the abilities of men, but not for the ſpirituall ſucceſs of the work. In Popery they will have their people glory in their Church-Officers becauſe of the external pomp and ſtatelineſs they live in, and ſo they become reverenced for their outward glory: But this is wholly unſuitable with the Scripture-glory, and the Scripture-rejoycing: for this alone will make thee praiſe God, if thou haſt found his Miniſters to be the happy Inſtruments of grace and peace to thy ſoul.</p>

               <p>THere remaineth the Second part of the Doctrine to be diſpatched, which is,</p>

                  <hi>The Miniſters rejoycing upon good grounds in his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For you heard how happy and bleſſed a thing it was when there was cauſe for a mutuall and reciprocall rejoycing in one another, between Miniſter and People. For God many times, upon wiſe ends, doth divide thoſe who ſhould be conjoyned: ſometimes he ſends faithfull Embaſſadours to a froward and rebellious people, as God in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that the people were <hi>bryars and thornes</hi> to him, and that he did dwell among <hi>ſcorpions;</hi> yet he muſt not be afraid, or diſmayed at their lookes, though they were <hi>a rebellious houſe,</hi> Chap. 2. 6. Now what comefort could <hi>Ezekiel</hi> have from ſuch a people? They were ſo many bryars and thornes ſcratching and tearing of him;
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:48709:249"/>
ſo many ſcorpions that had ſtings: and what danger was it to dwell with ſuch? Sometimes again there may be a godly and holy people, highly priſing the means of grace; and yet God ſet over them dumb or wicked Paſtors, that are <hi>Idols,</hi> and no ſhepherds. Now when this is ſo, their is little rejoycing in one another: and if <hi>Jehoaſh,</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 Kings 13. 9. compared an unequal Warr to an unequal and unfit Marriage, <hi>the thiſtle in Lebanon</hi> with the <hi>Cedar in Lebanon,</hi> which proved deſtructive immediately; for the wilde beaſt in <hi>Lebanon</hi> came, and trode down the Thiſtle: How much more now is this true in this ſpiritual relation? When an Ignorant or prophane Miniſter is over a gracious people, then the <hi>Thiſtle</hi> is married to the <hi>Cedar,</hi> but but this cannot hold long; for the Devil, which is like the wilde beaſt, the roaring Lyon, he will come, and devour all; ſo that, what the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. may well be applyed here, <hi>Be not unequally yoaked: what communion hath light with darkneſs?</hi> It is then very uncomfortable, when a Godly people hath an unfaithfull Miniſter, or a faithfull Miniſter an ungodly and a froward people; This will make him ſadly to bewail his condition, crying out with <hi>Iſay, Wo unto me, for I dwel among men of polluted lips, Iſay</hi> chap. 6. 12. This maketh him like <hi>Lot</hi> to torment his righteous ſoul by ſeing and hearing the wickedneſs of thoſe he dwelleth amongſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. This is a bitter and ſad Perſecution: as it were, thou doſt not onely perſecute a Miniſter by the malicious oppoſition, and violent courſes againſt him, but even thy ungodly life, that thou wilt not be reformed, that thou wilt not hear and humbly receive the word of God; this maketh them grieved, and wearied in their work; This is a perfecution of their righteous ſouls, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaid, chap. 13. 17. <hi>If you will not here it, my ſoul ſhall weep in ſecret places, for your pride.</hi> Thus the wickedneſs and ungodly wayes of a ſtubborn people are the very heart-breaking of a godly Miniſter; while they deride, and ſcorn, his ſoul mourneth for them; while they revile, and reproach him maliciouſly, he giveth himſelf to prayer for them; Even as it is with ſome tender Father, who hath a Son grievouſly diſtracted, and bereaved of his wits, while he rageth, and raveth at his Father, while he miſcalleth him and ſtriketh at him; The Father ſtands by ſadly affected, weeping, and praying for his childe, that he might be brought to his ſound minde again. Thus doth a godly tender Paſtor mourn over a wicked, ſcornfull, and rebellious People.</p>
               <p>But let us proceed to ſhew <hi>Wherein a faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt hath cauſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wherein a faithfull Paſtor hath cauſe to rejoyce over his people. 1. When they are tractable and teachable.</note> 
                  <hi>to rejoyce over his people:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>When they are a teachable and learning people, very tractable, and ready to receive Inſtruction.</hi> This is a great joy and Incouragement: There are many, who, as they are ſottiſhly ignorant in matters of Religion, ſo they will continue obſtinately therein: They are not deſirous and hearkning after knowledg; that ſay with thoſe in <hi>Job</hi> 21. 14. unto God, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi> Now it is for want of a true knowledg of God, that iniquity and profaneneſs doth abound every where; as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 1. Is it not better, and more comfortable to be a Shepherd to the bruit beaſts, than to ſuch men; for the Shepherd driveth his ſheep into what Paſture he pleaſeth, and ordereth them according to his deſire: but theſe, though bruitiſh in knowledge, yet are devilliſh in wilfulneſs and obſtinacy, and therefore, as they ignorant, ſo they will live and die, and go to Hell in it, go from darkneſs here to darkneſs hereafter. It is a very great comfort to preach to a knowing people, to men of underſtanding, and that are deſirous to be more and more and more inſtructed: There is great hope of ſuch a peoples converſion, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as you ſee by that expreſſion, <hi>Iſa. 6. 10. Leſt they underſtand with their heart, and be converted.</hi> What good doth the light at nown day to a blinde man? This makes Preaching in vain, and Hearing in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:48709:250"/>
Now, that you may be matter of rejoycing to your Miniſter in this reſpect, <note place="margin">Motives to knowledg in ſpiritual things. 1. Conſider the Neceſſity of it.</note> conſider theſe things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The neceſſity of knowledg in holy things:</hi> There is no ſalvation without it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. God would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the truth; If they will be ſaved, they muſt firſt come to the knowledg of the truth. Thou that art ſottiſhly ignorant of the Principles of Chriſtianity, there is no way for thy ſalvation; ſuch Ignorance as well as Profaneneſs will neceſſarily damn, <hi>Iſa. 26. 11. It is a people of no underſtanding; therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them.</hi> This very Text breaketh the ſtaff of your confidence; for you are ready to ſay, Alas, we are poor ignorant people, we know nothing, What then will this help you? <hi>No, God that made you, will not have mercy on you.</hi> It is true, we pitty poor old blinde men, becauſe they are blinde againſt their will, They would uſe any means to have their ſight: but you that are Ignorant, are no wayes to be pittied, for it is affected and willfull, your eyes might be opened, and you will not: Oh how ſad is it to preach to ſtones, to preach to poſts, for ſo we do, while to the groſly ignorant. Therefore as one ſaid, when asked what was the benefit of Learning; ſaith he, <hi>nè lapis ſedeat ſuper lupidem,</hi> that when a man is grown up, he may not in the Counſel-Houſe ſit as <hi>a ſtone upon a ſtone;</hi> implying, that a man without knowledg was no better than a ſenſleſs ſtone: and truly this good would you have by getting knowledg, that in the Congregation thou mayeſt not ſit a block upon a block. How grievous is it to have <hi>Idol-</hi>hearers, that have eyes but ſee not, and ears but hear not? Know then, to be an ignorant people is matter of grief to a godly Miniſter; for ſuch carry about with them, the viſible mark as it were, of condemnation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ye may be a knowing people, Conſider, not onely <hi>the neceſſity,</hi> but the <hi>uſefulneſs and profitableneſs of Chriſtian knowledg:</hi> By this we come <note place="margin">2. The uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</note> to know how to pleaſe God, how to be ſaved, how to enjoy eternal life. All are convinced of the neceſſity of knowledg of earthly things, They muſt know how to plow and ſow. Do you not ſet your children to know a Trade, do you not ſay, They muſt do ſomething that they may live, implying they are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly undone, if they know not theſe things? Oh fooliſh and unwiſe! Muſt men know how to live here, and not know how to live hereafter? Muſt men know how to keep of poverty, and not how to keep off damnation? Why then do you not lay aſide all things, to get ſome competent knowledg of Chriſtian Principles, without which you cannot get any good by Sermons, by acraments; without which ye cannot tell how to live, or how to die? And never complain, ſaying, Thou art two old, or thy memory is bad, It is plain, thou haſt no heart to it, no zeal and affection for it. For how many as unlikely as thou art have by diligence got knowledg, even to the admiration of others? And God, he uſeth to bleſs thoſe, and to encreaſe their gifts, that are ſerious in their deſires after theſe things: But the truth is, The world hath thy heart, Luſts have thy heart; If thou didſt follow the wiſe mans Counſel, <hi>to ſeek for it more than gold or ſilver, more then any precious treaſure,</hi> thou wouldeſt not be ſuch a blinde wretch as thou art; <hi>Then,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, thou ſhalt underſtand the fear of the Lord, and finde the knowledg of God, Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. If then thou dyeſt in thy ignorance, and without inſtruction, which is threatned as a dread full judgment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 23. blame thy own corrupt, lazy, and wicked heart: now this univerſal ignorance is the more abominable, becauſe we enjoy the plentifull means of knowledg we have conſtant Preaching, we have the Word read, and Ordinances adminiſtred in our known tongue. How intolerable then is it, if generally people be ſtill as ignorant as if the Bible were not tranſlated, and all Church Adminiſtrations diſpenſed in an unknown tongue?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Then are people matter of rejoycing to a miniſtry, when they are
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:48709:250"/>
believing of the word of God, and receiving it as Gods word, thereby</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. When people believe and receive the Word as Gods Word.</note> 
                  <hi>awing their hearts, and captivating the whole man thereunto.</hi> For knowledg is not enough. How many know, and can remember places of Scripture, can underſtand moſt Sermons? But they do not believe thoſe things to be true, neither are they ingrafted in their hearts by faith, ſaying, This is Gods word, how can I go againſt it? this is the word of God, and not man, that condemneth this ſin, commands that duty. Wo then be unto me if I gainſay it, for this the Apoſtle doth exceedingly commend the <hi>Theſſalonians, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. ye he is ſo affected with it, that he did <hi>thank God without ceaſing in his reſpect,</hi> even becauſe <hi>they received the word of God,</hi> which they heard of <hi>Paul, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh in thoſe that believe.</hi> How comfortable a thing is this, for a Miniſter to ſee his people receiving the truths he preaches of Gods word? They hear and tremble, they believe and tremble; ſo that without this ſaith, as it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, ſo it is to get any good by the Miniſtry. As its not the ſeeing of meat, but the eating of it, and digeſting, that doth nouriſh: ſo neither is it the hearing and knowing, but the believing of it that maketh a powerfull change upon a people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then a people rejoyce a faithfull Minister, when to knowledge</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. When they are converted by the Word.</note> 
                  <hi>and Faith there is added that compleat efficacy of the Word, as to regenerate us, and make us to become new creatures.</hi> Even men who yet will lye roaring for ever in Hell, may have great knowledg, and ſome faith; yet, becauſe not regenerated, not delivered fully from their bondage of ſin they lived in, do therefore come ſhort of Eternall glory. Now this is the moſt noble effect of the Preaching of the Word, that it becomes ſpiritual ſeed, to give men a new ſpirituall life, as well to feed, to nouriſh them therein, <hi>James,</hi> chap. 4. 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us, with the word of truth.</hi> and <hi>John. 17. Sanctifie them by thy word.</hi> When therefore the Miniſters of God do not onely become Inſtructers, but <hi>Fathers,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith he was to theſe <hi>Corinthians:</hi> this is matter of great joy, <hi>Though ye have ten thouſand Inſtructors, yet not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel, 1 Corinth.</hi> chap. 4. 15. This then is a foundation of much indearing comfort, when a people can owne their Miniſter to be a <hi>Father</hi> to them, and he them for his <hi>ſpiritual children;</hi> when by his Miniſtry they are able to ſay, I was enlightened, I was converted, I was ſanctified. Surely, if Ariſtotle ſay, We can never recompence the Gods, nor our naturall Fathers; neither are we able to requite our ſpiritual Fathers. Although as in nature it is obſerved, that love, though it be fire, yet it doth deſcend, not aſcend; ſo it is in ſpirituall relations. Such Miniſters who have been inſtrumental to the converſion of any, do far more rejoyce in ſuch a people, then they can in the Miniſter. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaketh moſt affectionately, in an overflowing manner, 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 11, 12, 13. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is inlarged, ye are not ſtreightened in us, but in your own bowels; now, for a recompence in the ſame (I ſpeak, as unto children) be ye alſo enlarged.</hi> Here you ſee <hi>Pauls</hi> heart was more inlarged to them than theirs to his. This then is an unſpeakable mercy, when we ſhall be able to ſay with the prophet, (though in another ſenſe) <hi>Behold I, and the children which thou haſt given me, Iſa.</hi> chap. 8. 18. Or, as it is ſaid of Chriſt, after all his ſufferings for us, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied. He ſhall ſee his ſeed, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall prosper in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then are they rejoycing to a Miniſter, when <hi>they are a ready</hi>

amongſt them, but a Garden without weeds, a floor of pure wheat without chaff; a net of good fiſh onely; a field of wheat without tares. It is true, there is no ſuch people, no ſuch Church to be exſpected in this life: But the leſs weeds, the fewer brambles, the greater joy to the Husbandman. What a glorious commendation doth the Apoſtle give this Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 3. when he calleth them <hi>his Epiſtle to be read and known of all men?</hi> Yea he ſaith, <hi>They are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt.</hi> O what unſpeakable gladneſs of heart would it be to a Miniſter to be able to make ſuch an holy boaſt of his people, That they are his Sermons to be read, and known of all men? we may know what he preacheth by the lives of his people. The Apoſtle inſtanceth in one Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Liberality to the poor Saints of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 13. For thereby they did glorifie God, by their profeſſed Subjection to the Goſpel. This is bleſſed, when a people in all Goſpel Duties will not cavil, and be contentious, but declare their profeſſed ſubjection thereunto.</p>

                  </gap>orm all corruptions and abuſes; as alſo, with much Repentance to manifeſt their ſorrow for any negligence and remiſſion herein. Theſe very <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as they were matter of joy, ſo alſo of much trouble, of much trouble, of much ſorrow, and Humiliation. Hence he ſpeaketh remarkeably, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 20. I fear least when I come, I ſhall not finde you ſuch as I would, and that I ſhall not be found unto you, ſuch as ye would; and leaſt when I come again, my God humble me among you, and that I ſhall bewail many which have ſinned already, and have not repented of their uncleanneſs.</hi> By this you ſee, that though the Apoſtle had much rejoycing from them, yet he had alſo much Humiliation: Many did not repent, and therefore put him to more ſeverity than he would. Now then that <hi>Paul</hi> may not contradict himſelf, They could not be his rejoycing, and mourning alſo. Therefore we muſt either hereby gather that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were unconſtant, ſometimes hopfull and reforming, and afterwards again relapſing: or elſe this is ſpoken not in reſpect of all, but ſome of them, who did groſly fail in their duty. For if we conſult with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 17. there we ſhall ſee the Apoſtle wonderfully affected with the joy that he had by ſeeing the good effect of his former <hi>Epiſtle</hi> upon them; for thereby they did ſet upon Church-order, they purged out the old leaven, they manifeſted much godly ſorrow, indignation and zeal, and every way endeavoured to approve themſelves unto <hi>Paul,</hi> and this did ſo exceedingly rejoyce him, that he ſaith, Verſ. 4. <hi>Great is my glorying of you, I am filled with comefort, I am exceeding joyfull in all our tribulation.</hi> In the midſt of all his troubles this rejoyced his heart, that they did themſelves aſſiſt to the caſting out of wicked perſons, and were exceeding ſorrowfull for their former negligence herein. Thus then, when a people are ready to obſerve all the Orders, and Inſtituions of Chriſt, this is matter of great joy. But becauſe many Churches have received but half Chriſt, as it were; hence alſo their Miniſters have received but half joy: Some Proteſtant Churches received the Doctrine of Chriſt, but not the Diſcipline: Some were for Orthodoxy in judgment, but not purity in lives; Some were willing to caſt of the Antichriſtian yoke, but then would not ſubmit to the rod of Chriſt: And by this means many faithfull Paſtors have gone to the grave with great grief of heart. Oh it is a ſad thing when people are ſo willfull, as to neceſſitate a Miniſter to remove from them, becauſe they will not receive the whole Order of Chriſt, ſo that he is limited in his Miniſterial Adminiſtrations, and cannot do all he deſireth. Thus theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> failed alſo about holy Order, in reference to the Lords Supper, which maketh him begin his diſcourſe about it after this manner, <hi>Shall I praiſe you in this? I praiſe you not,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 22. There are many other particulars, which rejoyce a Faithfull Miniſter, as when they <hi>continue
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:48709:251"/>
from not falling off from the truth,</hi> either by falſe Teachers, or afflictions, (which is ſo great a matter, that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſ. 3. 8. We live, if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord)</hi> likewiſe, when they are a <hi>growing people,</hi> and do not continue as babes, but are carried unto perfection, and do not ſtand ſtill, but walk in the truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Though for the preſent theſe things are a fable, or a ſcorne to thee, yet remember, all the Sermons and Admonitions thou haſt had, all the pains and ſtudies taken for the Salvation of thy ſoul, will one day witneſs againſt thee. This will make us with ſadneſs and trembling to think what account can we give of ſuch perſons at that great Day: we that have prayed for you, preached to you, mourned for you, muſt then be your Accuſers; we cannot help it: The Lord will require your ſouls at our hands, and then muſt we ſay, <hi>O Lord, ſuch a ſinner, and ſuch a ſinner, we have reproved him, we have declared thy will to him, but he would have his luſts though he were damned for them, he regardeth his ſinnes more than heaven, and eternal life.</hi> Let us conclude all with that ſad and ſerious place; and oh that it might never out of your heart, but be with you ſitting and walking, riſing and going to bed, <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. In which Text is much excellent matter, but I ſhall touch at it onely. Firſt, There is the <hi>Sanction and eſtabliſhment of a Miniſtry and Paſtors over a people;</hi> For they are commanded to <hi>obey ſuch.</hi> Where are they then that cry down a miniſtry, think it needleſs, at leaſt no Inſtitution of Chriſt? Secondly, Here is eſtabliſhed the <hi>dignity of Miniſters,</hi> partly by their Titles, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they are <hi>Guides, Leaders,</hi> ſuch as are ſet over you; and partly in the <hi>duty</hi> enjoyned the people, which is to <hi>obey,</hi> and <hi>ſubmit.</hi> The firſt ſignifieth <hi>obedience,</hi> the other <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> ſo that they are to yield to the wholeſome Counſels of their Paſtors, and that with honor to them. 3. Here is the office of a Paſtor <hi>to watch for the peoples ſoules,</hi> ſo that, if the Honor tempt, here is the Duty and danger which may deterr. 4. There is the <hi>duty</hi> of the people, as you heard, <hi>to obey</hi> and <hi>ſubmit.</hi> 5. Here is a Reaſon of it, <hi>They are to give an account of your ſoules;</hi> we are Stewards, and to ſee that one ſheep be not loſt. So that the Miniſters office is more dangerous, becauſe he muſt account for himſelf and many others alſo; which made <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> wonder, if any Guide or Officer of a Church could be ſaved; but that he ſpeaketh, ſaith <hi>Eſtius,</hi> becauſe of the many evil and negligent ones; otherwiſe, ſuch as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> himſelf would be ſaved. Neither is this Text to diſcourage good and Faithfull Paſtors, but rather to comefort them, becauſe God will, in a ſpecial manner be with them, and bleſs their Labours. Now the Apoſtle ſheweth, that this is a ſpecial means to diſcourage them, if by their wickedneſs people ſo walk, as that they ſhall render their account with grief. For certainly, if the more they have converted, the greater their accidental joy will be, then the more are damned (though not by their fault) the greater will their grief be. And that we might not think it a light matter thus to diſcourage and grieve a Miniſter, either in his Paſtoral labours for their ſoules, (as ſome relate the words) or when, at the day of Judgment, he is to give an account (as others) he addeth, <hi>this is not profitable to you,</hi> that is, you will finde the loſs of this, you will ſmart for it; God will reward them for their Labours, though ye be damned. Thus God will be avenged for your ingratitude herein. But what people think of theſe things?</p>

               <p>VVE now come to conſider the time, when this mutual <hi>rejoycing of Paul, and the Corinthians in one another,</hi> will be moſt remarkable, and that is ſaid to be, <hi>In the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> For although he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the preſent tenſe, <hi>We are, and you are our rejoycing;</hi> yet that is chiefly to be referred to the <hi>laſt day.</hi> It is true, for the preſent he had much joy in them, and they in him; but this was as the gleaning in reſpect of the Harveſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. <hi>Beza,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>In what ſenſe, <hi>Paul</hi> is called the <hi>Corinthians joy or boaſt,</hi> you have heard, <hi>viz.</hi> inſtrumentally, not principally. Therefore <hi>Eſtius</hi> ſtretcheth too farre, more than ordinarily he uſeth to do; when from that expreſſion uſed by <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 20. <hi>Ye are our glory and joy;</hi> he would juſtifie their practice in Popery, who in their prayers call the Virgin <hi>Mary, their life, and hope.</hi> For notwithſtonding all their ſubtil diſtinctions, that is to derogate from the Mediatorſhip of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But to our purpoſe. This <hi>rejoycing in one another,</hi> is chiefly to be put forth at the day of Chriſt. And if you ask, <hi>How can we then rejoyce in any thing, but God only? Is not the bleſſedneſſe of Heaven deſcribed by this, that we ſee God, that we enjoy him? So that to rejoyce in any thing elſe beſides God, ſeemeth to be like deſiring a candle, when we have the light of the Sunne. How can a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for example rejoyce, in the converſion of ſuch and ſuch perſons, when he hath an infinite object of joy, even God himſelf to delight in? Can any thing be added to that which is infinite?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it is anſwered, that there is <hi>an eſſential</hi> and an <hi>accidental joy</hi> in Heaven. The <hi>eſſential</hi> one lieth in beholding the face of God to all eternity, and this cannot be increaſed or diminiſhed: But then there is an <hi>accidental joy,</hi> which ariſeth from particular occaſions or motives; and though Heaven and eternal happineſs doth not conſiſt in this, yet it doth accidentally make us to rejoyce in more things. Thus the <hi>Angels,</hi> though they do ſee the face of God, and thereby are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly happy, yet they are ſaid, <hi>To rejoyce upon the converſion of a ſinner.</hi> And thus the faithfull Paſtors of Gods Church, the more have been converted by their ſpiritual labours, the greater will their joy accidentally be. Not that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of joy or glory is merited by any, as ſome have thought: for this alſo is of the meer gift of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:48709:252"/>
The time when this ſolemn rejoycing ſhall be, is ſaid to be <hi>the day of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> and as ſome Copies have it, <hi>Of our Lord Jeſus.</hi> It is uſual in Scripture to call <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> that wherein he doth work ſome great mercy and deliverance for his people, or that wherein he doth inflict ſome eminent and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous judgements upon the enemies of his Church. So that there is the <hi>day of his mercy,</hi> and the <hi>day of his judgement.</hi> Now becauſe of the end of the world, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> will in a full and compleat manner recompence his people, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh all the ungodly; therefore that is in a more remarkable manner called, <hi>The day of Chriſt.</hi> It is true, there are ſome learned men, that beſides the day of Chriſts firſt coming, which was not <hi>to deſtroy, but ſave;</hi> and the day of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, they make a middle one, and that is the day wherein God did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Iews,</hi> and utterly deſtroy the Temple and City, bringing wrath upon them to the full for their crucifying of Chriſt, and their other ſinnes. And of this they would underſtand our Saviours diſcourſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and in many other places, where they are commanded <hi>to watch, and to pray, or to be patient and joyfull, becauſe the day of the Lord is at hand. That day</hi> (ſay they) <hi>when God would deſtroy</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and deliver the believing</hi> Jews <hi>from the unbelieving and perſecuting ones.</hi> Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> the late Annotator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But becauſe this is to go againſt the common rode of Interpreters, we muſt not have ſome ſpecious colours, but ſtrong reaſons to make us depart from the beaten way. To be ſure here, as in many other places, by the day of Chriſt is meant that laſt day of his, when he ſhall come as a King and Judge, to give to every one according to his wayes. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſt hath a ſolemn day, wherein wonderfull and great changes will</hi>

                  <hi>be made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though for the preſent <hi>Paul</hi>'s joy, and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in one another, was not very conſpicuous and glorious; yet at that ſolemn day, then this glory would be no longer eclipſed, but break forth in a marvellous manner.</p>
               <p>Concerning this day, that there is ſuch an one, as alſo the properties of it, elſwhere is ſpoken of, in a Sermon on <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. and I ſhall not therefore med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in that. My work ſhall be to inſtance in ſome of thoſe remarkable <hi>changes,</hi> which this ſolemn day will then make, and how we are to live in reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Let us take up that for which the Apoſtle mentioneth it here in the Text,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. There will be a great change, as to the comforts of a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and people.</note> 
                  <hi>There will be an happy, and a glorious change, as to the comforts of a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and a converted people.</hi> Oh the unſpeakable gladneſs of heart that then ſhall be! When the Miniſter ſhall ſee the ſucceſs of his labour; when he ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>Behold my five have gained ten: Behold I, and the children whom thou haſt given me.</hi> Theſe are the redeemed ones from the bondage of ſinne and Satan; and then the Lord ſhall give that comfortable acclamation, <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſervant, enter thou into thy Maſters joy,</hi> Matth. 25. 23. Oh what tongue can expreſs, what heart can conceive, the joy that ſuch a Miniſter ſhall have! This day, I ſay this day, may make him deſpiſe all the reproaches, all the injuries and contumelies that wicked men ſhall put upon him, while they call thee ſuch and ſuch names. Hearken to thoſe titles, <hi>Come thou good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſervant.</hi> The thoughts alſo of this day would exceedingly quicken us up in our ſtudies, in our miniſterial labours, ſo to preach, ſo to ſtudy, ſo to watch over your ſouls, as thoſe that have this ſolemn day in their hearts. Again, this day will make a wonderfull change, as to a <hi>godly people:</hi> How ſhall they then rejoyce in that Miniſter, and in thoſe Sermons which have been powerfull to convert them, and to bring them to that place of glory? Their hearts will then be enlarged: Oh bleſſed be God, bleſſed be the time that ever you were a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:48709:253"/>
to us, that ever ſuch and ſuch a Sermon was preached! When you ſhall ſee a blind Miniſter, and a blind people both going to hell together, and you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and that by ſuch a Miniſtry you enjoyed in your life time: This will fill your hearts up with your rejoycing. Though now a faithfull Miniſter and godly people in their Church-ways may meet with much oppoſition, much difficulty and diſcouragement; yet <hi>lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</hi> How pleaſant will it be when you are come to the haven, to think of the dangerous ſtorms and tempeſts you were once in? But this day will make as great, but a ſad change, as to all wicked men, who have been as weeds in Gods garden, who though watered and tilled, yet bring forth no fruit. Oh the terrour of this day to you! Though now no Sermon moveth thee; thou ſitteſt and ſleepeſt while Gods word is preached; though now thou goeſt from the Aſſemblies to thy ſports and pleaſures of ſinne, and there is no more matter made of it: But wo, and a thouſand times woe to thee at this day of Chriſt, when we Miniſters, and you people ſhall be brought face to face; then we ſhall be your accuſers, then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sermon will accuſe you, then every Lords-day will riſe up, and witneſs againſt you. Oh be not ſo ſottiſh as to think, all things will continue as they do! Remember there is a day that will make the moſt prophane, the proudeſt, and the moſt ſtupid hearer to be awakened.</p>
               <p>Secondly, At that day <hi>there will be a mighty change upon the prophane man wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. A great change in the prophane ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> 
                  <hi>in his ſins, and following the pleaſures thereof.</hi> Then he that pleaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in theſe luſts, will call to the mountains to cover him, and hide him from the preſence of God. What a difference will there be between the man priding himſelf in his ſinfull wayes, and when he ſhall hear that ſentence pronounced againſt him, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels?</hi> In which ſentence every word almoſt is terrible, <hi>Depart from me;</hi> they muſt be ſeparated from God, who is the fountain of life and joy. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> thought this privative part more terrible than the poſitive. <hi>To depart from God,</hi> never to have his favor, is worſe than thoſe eternal ſcorching flames of hell. What if for the preſent ſuch perſons of honourand greatneſs bid thee come to them, if God ſhall bid thee <hi>depart from him?</hi> Oh remember, when ſin bids thee come, when the world bids thee come, one day God will bid thee <hi>depart!</hi> Again, that title and property given to ſuch forlorn damned men is terrible, yea <hi>curſed, curſed</hi> by God, and who then can <hi>bleſſe? Curſed]</hi> How much better, if thou hadſt never bin born, then to be in the number of theſe <hi>curſed</hi> ones? What if now thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, and others bleſs thee, thou wilt then be pronounced <hi>curſed?</hi> Further, the place into which they muſt <hi>depart,</hi> is terrible beyond all expreſſion, <hi>into fire,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting fire. Fire]</hi> Is not that moſt dreadfulll? Do not your hearts ake and tremble? Do not your ears tingle at the naming of this puniſhment? But if it be <hi>fire,</hi> it may be quickly over, the pain may be preſently gone, it may quickly conſume to aſhes. No, it is <hi>everlaſting fire;</hi> after thouſands and millions of years, it is ſtill the ſame, as hot to burn as at the firſt moment. If God had ſaid, thou ſhalt lie roaring in hell flames till a thouſand years are over, for ſuch and ſuch a ſinne not repented of, might not this have prevailed with every man, to leave the moſt pleaſant, and the moſt profitable ſinne that is? How much more when it is <hi>everlaſting,</hi> when there is no end? Oh the change thou wilt then find upon thy ſelf! Then thou wilt cry out ſaying, Was my hours pleaſure, my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments profit equal to theſe eternal torments? Now ſay, Whether it is better to ſinne, then to be damned? Are thy luſts equivalent to all the torments of hell? Laſtly, That is no little aggravation, <hi>Prepared for the Devil and his Angels]</hi> You ſee what companions you muſt have: As much as you now defie the Devil, you and he muſt lie down in the ſame flames. The Devils will have no worſe place than thou haſt. Now if this be ſo, What a mighty alteration is here made? The man that like <hi>Dives</hi> fared deliciouſly every day, would have a drop of water to
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:48709:253"/>
cool his tongue, and cannot. Oh that the Spirit of God would convince and aſſure you of theſe things! Say, now I am merry, proud, confident: Now I follow my luſts, my pleaſures; but will not the day of judgement then make a <hi>change?</hi> Will not there be a ſad difference between my preſent eſtate, and that then?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>As to the godly man there will be a moſt happy and bleſſed change.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. A great change to the godly.</note> To ſee a <hi>Lazarus</hi> wiping his ſores, taken up into <hi>Ambraham</hi>'s boſome: What a bleſſed change is here? The godly man hath his exerciſes from many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The world derideth and oppoſeth him; afflictions from God cruſh him, and preſs him down: The Devil becauſe he ſhall not have an hell hereafter, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth he may have an hell here; and from within, there are luſts, there are moleſting motions to ſinne, which make him cry out, <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am!</hi> But when this day ſhall come, what man, though he had the tongue of Angels, is able to declare his happineſs? This man that was ſcorned, is now bleſſed, and honoured by all the wicked damned ones of the world. Now they cry, Oh that our caſe were like his! Oh that our ſouls were as his ſhall be! Now the Devil is trampled under feet, and thrown into the <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> into the deep, where he was ſo unwilling to go, to receive the full of his torments. Now the ſpiritual warre within, is put to a period, and he doth all the good, in as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and full a manner as he can deſire to do; his will and his power have the ſame bounds; he can do what he would, and he can will all that God would have him to will. We read of bleſſed changes in this world, of <hi>Joſeph</hi> from a poor priſoner in the dungeon, and in danger of his life, to be exalted in the higheſt place of honour in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> next to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelf. Of <hi>Mordechai,</hi> who was deſigned to death, and immediately made the man whom God would honour. Of <hi>David,</hi> from following the ſheep, and afterwards driven as a Bird from the mountain, to be made a great King. Yet none of theſe come up in the leaſt manner to this great change. Hence it is called, <hi>The day of redemption, Matth. 24. The day of refreſhing and reſtoring of all things,</hi> Act. 3. 19. (for we muſt not limit that time to the deſtruction of the <hi>Iews</hi> only, as ſome do) Yea the godly are <hi>to look for, and haſten his coming,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 12. as being the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage time between Chriſt and his Church, <hi>Therefore the Spirit and the bride ſay, Come,</hi> Revel. 22. 17. It is for want of a lively meditation about this, that the godly at any time ſink under any temptations. Is there any evil thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with, that this day will not deliver thee from? Is it not a day of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, never to be in bondage any more, either to ſinne or miſery? Eſpecially the Church under afflictions and perſecutions, is to fetch all her comfort from thence: God will turn her ſackcloth into robes of honour, her dungeons into heavenly manſions. Should not then the Church ſit expecting his victorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more affectionately, then <hi>Siſera</hi>'s mother, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 28. did his return? ſaying, <hi>Why is his chariot ſo long a coming? Why tarry the wheels of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots? Luther</hi> ſpeaking of this hopefull expectation that ought to be in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſts coming, endeavoured to affect his hearers from the condition they were in at that time. The Popiſh party did triumph over the Reformed, boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>Caeſar</hi> was coming with a great Army, that he would preſently and ſpeedily vanquiſh all the <hi>Lutherans. Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as you ſee they rejoyce, and fill themſelves with hopes of the Emperours coming, ſo ſhould the Church under all her preſſures with the coming of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>There will be a mighty change, as to mens judgements and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. A great change in mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of ſinne and holineſs.</note> 
                  <hi>over what they have now.</hi> There is never a wicked man would for an hour go on in his ſins, if he could have ſuch thoughts, as he will have at that day. Oh that we could look upon ſinne, as we will then look upon it! when God ſhall bid us <hi>Depart into everlaſting fire.</hi> And certainly, if part of that terrour did work ſo much upon <hi>Iudas,</hi> that he throweth away his ſilver, crieth out, <hi>He had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:48709:254"/>
in betraying of innocent blood.</hi> No wonder if when all the gall of Gods wrath be poured into a mans conſcience, he then crieth out of his ſins, gnaſheth the teeth at them, remembreth them with horrour, which were once ſo full of ſweetneſs and delight. Go on then preſumptuouſly thou prophane wretch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no Scripture, deride at all good counſel: Say, Give me my ſins, though I be damned; yet remember this perſwaſion will not hold alwayes; there will come a day when thou wilt as much loath and abhorre theſe luſts, as ever once thou didſt love them. Oh that men could now behold their ſins with that horrour and indignation, as they will when they ſhall ſtand trembling at Gods tribunal. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, men will have other thoughts, 1. About the <hi>wayes of Godlineſſe.</hi> 2. About <hi>Godly men.</hi> And, 3. About <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For falſe principles and miſ-judging about theſe, is that which maketh ſo many damn themſelves.</p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt, about <hi>Godlineſſe;</hi> they think it is an hinderance to man; if he were not ſo juſt and conſcionable, he might ſwallow down many a ſweet morſel which he lets go. Thus men are ready to think they fare the worſe for godlineſs. Oh but when thou ſhalt ſee, what that Heaven, what that glory and happineſs is, which at that day godlineſs will give thee full poſſeſſion of, how quickly will thy thoughts alter? Then thou wilt cry out, Oh it is a mans riches to be godly, it is a mans wiſdome to be godly, a mans profit to be godly, though he did there by loſe all this preſent world!</p>
               <p>Again, We are prejudiced againſt <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> becauſe it is not in honour and repute. None of the great men, of the wiſe men, do much regard it: Men of great eſtates and birth, think godlineſs below their greatneſs; that it is a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, a ſtain to their reputation to walk preciſely and ſingularly to the wicked courſe of the world. But in this alſo that day will make a mighty change; when you ſhall ſee, that then godlineſs is only enquired after. Then the Queſtion will be, How haſt thou lived? How haſt thou kept thy ſelf unſpotted from ſinne? Then thou wouldſt give thouſands of worlds for <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> That holineſs and purity thou now laugheſt at, it will at that day be only in requeſt. At that day there is no difference between Kings and peaſants, between the noble and baſe, between the rich and poor; but either wicked or godly, ſheep or goats, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the diſtinction. If <hi>Alexander</hi> plead, he conquered the world: If <hi>Crae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſui</hi> plead the multitude of riches: If one ſaith, he is an Emperour, another he is a Nobleman, a Gentleman, theſe are abſurd pleas at that day. Art thou a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an holy man? This only will carry it. Oh then remember, you will have other thoughts of <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> than now you have! It will be more in requeſt and honourable eſteem, than now it is. Whoſoever he be that doth evil, though the great Potentates of the world, the Judge will then ſay, <hi>Depart, I know you not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, We are prejudiced againſt <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> becauſe we think it is too ſtrict, it requireth too much of us: It will not allow us thoſe pleaſures and delights we might have. Oh but at that day, ſuch a thought will preſently vaniſh; all the labour of my life thou wilt ſay, is not worthy to one minute of this glory; could I have been a Martyr every day, it would not have been equivalent to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happineſs!</p>

               <p>AT this <hi>great day</hi> (you heard) there would <hi>be a wonderfull change up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thoughts and perſwaſions of men, to what they are now.</hi> It is not ſo much, what thy affections and apprehenſions are for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <note place="margin">There will be a great change in wicked mens thoughts</note> but what they be at that day. Eſpecially in three things this <hi>Change</hi> will be ſeen,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. About <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> which hath been diſpatched.</item>
                  <item>2. About <hi>Good men.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. About <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>We come therefore to the ſecond, and that is the wonderfull change <note place="margin">2. Of good men, as</note> that wicked men ſhall then have in reference to thoſe who live <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and dare not conforme themſelves to the courſe of this world. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such who ſeparate themſelves from the evil wayes of the world, <note place="margin">1. That they are fools.</note> 
                  <hi>They are matter of reproach and ſcorne; They are judged the fooles, and the ſimple ones, by all that live near them;</hi> But at that day, you will have other thoughts, you will then admire their happineſſe, call your ſelves the fools and deluded ones, wiſhing that it might fare ſo with you, as it doth with them. It is ſaid of thoſe noble Worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 38. That they had <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of cruel mockings.</hi> Yea <hi>David,</hi> though a King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 12. complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>He was the ſong of the drunkards.</hi> Thus you ſee what thoughts men of the world have of ſuch who fear God; as <hi>Michal</hi> did <hi>David, They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them in their heart.</hi> But oh the wonderfull alteration that day will cauſe, when thou ſhalt ſee thoſe who were deſpiſed by thee, honoured by God: Thoſe whom thou didſt reproach, to be bleſſed by God: What a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will this be to thee? Then you will cry out, We fools and mad men, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their wayes folly and matter of ſcorn; but with what unſpeakable glory doth God honour them?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another falſe perſwaſion they have about <hi>godly men,</hi> is, That <note place="margin">2. Hypocrites.</note> they are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> that all they do is not out of love to God, but for oſtentation ſake. That it is not the glory of God, but their own glory and advantage, that they ſeek after. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo often charged with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ends in his Miniſtry, that he is compelled to make his Apologetical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to clear himſelf. Yea Chriſt himſelf was judged by the <hi>Phariſees</hi> to be an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> and that he came of himſelf, doing his own will, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:48709:255"/>
his own glory, which made him ſo earneſtly deny it, <hi>Iohn 6. 38. Iohn</hi> 8. 50. This is a ſore evil upon the ſonnes of men, that becauſe they have an enmity and hatred againſt the godly, yet they cannot put this forth upon godlineſſe, as godlineſſe, therefore they repreſent the godly in ſuch colours, and lay ſuch things to their charge, that they may ſeeme to have juſt cauſe to vent their malice againſt them. But at that day their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and integrity will appear; then all the world ſhall ſee, that their hearts were upright, their aimes and intentions ſincere; that what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, what holy endeavours they uſed for the recovering of men out from their ſinnes, was not out of hatred, or any other ill principle, as wicked men are now apt to judge, but out of pure love and deſire for their ſoules good. Let not then evil and ungodly men, take upon them to judge the hearts of others, that is the prerogative of God alone; neither doe thou judge before the great day of judgement. Take heed of calling ſuch <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>diſſemblers;</hi> of calling ſuch <hi>Phariſaical</hi> and <hi>conceited,</hi> whom it may be God will own at that day, for his jewels, for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones. If there be any <hi>Judas,</hi> who followeth Chriſt becauſe of the <hi>Bagge;</hi> If there be any who believe in Chriſt, yet love the glory of men more than of God, they ſhall beare their burden. The portion of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in Hell, is a double portion: But let not all the Apoſtles be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a <hi>Judas;</hi> Let not all be judged Hypocrites, becauſe he was ſo. Remember that this day is a revelation of all things: all the hidden pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and counſels of mens hearts ſhall then be made manifeſt. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle giveth this exhortation to ſuch as judged him, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4. 5. he ſheweth them, how little <hi>he regarded mans judgement, for it is the Lord that judgeth.</hi> Therefore they are not to judge any thing before the time, untill the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and will make manifeſt the counſels of mens hearts, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God. Is not this a full place, to make thee afraid of all cenſures and hard ſpeeches againſt ſuch who profeſſe godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Let them alone to the Lord; there is a day, when all the thoughts of their hearts, all the purpoſes and intentions of the ſoule in holy duties ſhall be made manifeſt; it ſhall then be diſcovered, who was faithfull, and who was inſincere, and wilt thou anticipate this day? Little doeſt thou thinke how much ſuch as feare God in truth, doe bewaile that partial hypocriſie and inſincerity which is within them; how greatly they feare, leſt they ſhould deceive themſelves, and doe holy duties for falſe ends, and not out of pure reſpect to God himſelfe; Such then ſhall have praiſe of God, and their integrity manifeſted before Angels and men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There will be a change of mens thoughts as to the godly, <hi>In</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In reſpect to their outward eſtate.</note> 
                  <hi>respect of their external eſtate and condition.</hi> They have for the moſt part the evil things of the world, when the wicked enjoy the glorious things thereof. Are not afflictions, troubles and miſeries, as inſeparably follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people of God, as the ſhadow doth the body? Doth not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour fore-warn his Diſciples of the great trouble that they ſhall meet with in the world? Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſay, 1 <hi>Corinth. 15. 19. If we have hope in this life onely, we are of all men moſt miſerable? Of all men]</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other men will follow the pleaſures and profits of the world: Other men will ſuck out the honey that is to be had in the creatures; They will eſcape all miſery and perſecution, by becoming any thing in Religion, and thereby ſave themſelves out of danger; but as for the godly they are as ſheep appointed for the ſlaughter all the day long: Their tender conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and feare to ſinne againſt God, putteth them into many loſſes and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:48709:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſadvantages, which the men of the world can imbrace. Now it being thus with them, this doth exceedingly prejudice men againſt godly men. Their outward condition is many times dangerous; they ſeeme to be caſt off even by God himſelfe, as if he did not love them, or owne them for his; and this keepeth off many from walking in the pathes of holineſſe. If the applauſe, honour, and great things of the world did accompany the power of godlineſſe, then all would ſtrive to enter in at ſuch a broad gate; but becauſe it is with them, as with Chriſt, they appeare with no external glory and lovelineſſe upon them. Hence it is that of all men they will not owne ſuch, or joyne to ſuch. But this great day will make you have other thoughts of their condition; when you ſhall ſee their ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth taken off, and robes of honour put upon them; when you ſhall ſee theſe <hi>Lazaruſſes</hi> with no more ſores on them, or deſiring crummes from the Table, but placed in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome. This will make you then to wiſh, Oh that we had endured the ſame hardſhip, gone through the ſame wilderneſſe, ſeeing they have now arrived at ſuch a bleſſed Land, as they are!</p>
               <p>In the third and laſt place, <hi>The thoughts and apprehenſions of men about Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Their thoughts will be changed as to Chriſt. 1. They will then behold him the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good.</note> 
                  <hi>will be greatly changed at that day, from what they have at preſent;</hi> in two particulars eſpecially,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When Chriſt is offered</hi> now to us, and we may be made partakers of him, yet we refuſe him, we will not receive him, we had rather have our luſts than Chriſt; we love father, mother, and life it ſelfe, more than Chriſt. Such low thoughts have we of him now: But oh the time is coming, when Chriſt, and onely Chriſt will be in requeſt! At that day he is happy who ſhall have an intereſt in Chriſt. Thoſe <hi>Gadarens</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Chriſt to depart out of their coaſts, regarding their hoggs more than he; with what confuſion will they behold him at that day? We ſhall then ſee there is good reaſon for that Doctrine, <hi>He that loveth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, more than me: or he that loveth life it ſelf more than me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of me,</hi> Matth. 10. 37. For happily fleſh and blood may for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſay, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who can beare it?</hi> To love Chriſt more than father that begat me, and maintaineth me; from whom happily I may expect great and large gifts: Or better than life, which is above all earthly mercies. Will Chriſt be as good as theſe to me? Shall I not loſe by loving him more than theſe? But if a man conſider what Chriſt is? How he will appeare at that day? How happy are they who can claime an intereſt in him? Then they will ſee reaſon, why Chriſt ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred above all. Now we are for <hi>Barabbas</hi> rather than Chriſt: Now Chriſt knocketh at the door to come in, and we will not open to him: But who is there then that would not cry out, Oh let Chriſt juſtifie me, let him ſanctifie me, let him ſave me! Thus the <hi>ſtone that is now refuſed, will be the head corner-ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Many deceive themſelves in their thoughts about <hi>Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. As a Judge, as well as a Saviour.</note> 
                  <hi>onely love and willingneſſe in him to ſave.</hi> They never thinke of Chriſt, but as a <hi>Saviour:</hi> Though never ſo polluted by ſinne, yet they call him, their <hi>good Saviour,</hi> their <hi>bleſſed Saviour;</hi> but at this day, thou wilt then have other thoughts: Thou wilt then ſee, he can damne as well ſave; he can be a Lion as well as a Lambe. This mercifull Saviour will be a ſevere and juſt Judge. Thus <hi>(Revelat.</hi> 6. 16, 17.) you have the great men, and rich men of the earth, hiding themſelves in Dens, and calling to <hi>the Mountaines and Rockes to fall upon them, and hide them from the wrath of the Lambe, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> Thus you ſee, that your thoughts about Chriſt at that day, will
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48709:256"/>
be wholly changed: You that thinke onely of mercy, that ſpeak onely of mercy, that look onely upon Chriſt as a Saviour: What trembling will this be to you, when you ſhall ſee him come as a Judge with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of Angels, when you ſhall heare him pronounce his terrible ſentence upon ungodly men, then how will your hearts melt within you? Then you will beginne to ſay within your ſelves, Oh that we had not made an Idol-Chriſt, that we had not fancied a Chriſt to our ſelves! This is not ſuch a Chriſt as we looked for! This is not ſuch a Chriſt as we expected! Even as the <hi>Jewes</hi> looked for another <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> then was indeed to come, which proved their deſtruction: So alſo many doe fancy to themſelves ſuch a Saviour, made up onely of mercy at that great day. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas they promiſe to themſelves peace, they will meet with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and deſolation. And thus much for thoſe particulars. The next ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Propoſition is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there will be a wonderfull change upon mens thoughts in reference to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">There will be at the great day a great change as to Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods dispenſations, and his providence in this world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods proceedings here below have beene the ſubject of many <hi>Heathens</hi> diſputes. Yea <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> were ready to ſtagger and fall with the conſideration of Gods various dealings in this world; eſpecially that particular went deep into them, why God ſhould let the wicked live in all proſperity, and at hearts eaſe, and in the meane while, the godly goe bowed downe, not able to lift up their heads? Now this Queſtion will never be fully anſwered, till that great day; and therefore it is called, <hi>The day of reſtoring of all things,</hi> Acts 3. 21. which word ſignifieth, that here in this world many things ſeeme to be out of order; it is ill with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, well with a wicked man; but then God will put every one in his proper place: The wicked ſhall be, where he ought to be, and the godly where he is to be. Then we ſhall no longer cry out, <hi>How unſearchable are his wayes, and paſt finding out?</hi> For then God will cleare all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings which have been in this world. Then we ſhall know, why this was ſo, and that ſo: Why God did help at ſuch a time, and not before. Then all the proceedings of God, whether in a way of judgement or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that doe aſtoniſh us, ſhall be opened; all the wiſdome, goodneſſe and righteouſneſſe of God ſhall then be manifeſted to the whole world. Thue we ſhall ſee a wonderfull alteration.</p>
               <p>The next Propoſition, and laſt ſhall be this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At that day there will be a vaſt and unspeakable change made upon ſome</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Laſtly, There will be a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial change made upon ſome ſinners, as the jolly, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and ſelf-righteous.</note> 
                  <hi>ſinners especially.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though we told you all <hi>ſinners</hi> would have other thoughts, and looke upon themſelves in another manner than they doe now; yet to ſome ſinners this day will bring a remarkable, but a terrible alteration As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The rich and jolly ſinner,</hi> who liveth in all manner of pleaſures without any moleſtation at all: Here will be a dreadfull change to him, to goe from his down-bed to the flames in Hell: To be fetched from his merry companions, to be for ever tormented by the Devils. The Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luke 16. 20. doth egregiouſly demonſtrate this; <hi>Dives</hi> is taken from his delicate fare, and great abundance, plunged in ſuch a want of all mercies, that he cannot have one drop of water, to aſſwage his torment. <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo telleth of his change, <hi>verſ. 25. Remember that
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48709:256"/>
thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, but now thou art tormented</hi> What thunder and lightning ſhould this be to every ſuch jolly ſinner? Why doeſt thou not ſay to thy ſelf, now thou art jolly and merry; but will this hold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, will there never be any change?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſecret cloſe ſinner,</hi> he who carrieth himſelf in all plauſible wayes of piety, but then continueth in private ſecret ſinnes; Now this day will eſpecially be for the bringing to light all ſuch hidden wayes of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. <hi>Solomon</hi> concludeth his Booke with this, <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 14. God will bring every ſecret thing to light, whether good or evil.</hi> This day will be a terrible day for all ſuch as hide, and keep cloſe their ſinnes: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done in ſecret but will then be made manifeſt to the whole world. How terrible will this day be to the ſecret uncleane perſon, to the ſecret thieſ, to the ſecret unjuſt man? Know to thy terrour at that day, they will be no more ſecret. As they ſay of letters written with ſome juyce, they cannot be read till they be brought to the fire, and then what was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcernable, is very legible: Thus it will be at that day; The ſinnes no man knoweth by thee, thoſe evil wayes the world cannot charge upon thee, will then be made known to all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>All Phariſaical and ſelf-righteous perſons,</hi> all thoſe who are ſtrongly perſwaded of their good condition, but upon falſe grounds: This will be very terrible to ſuch. Many men live ſo prophanely, and die ſo wickedly, that they cannot but expect damnation, they muſt looke for no other: but there is a generation of perſons (Oh how many of them!) that doe applaud themſelves in their own good hearts: They doubt not of Gods favour; they conclude, whenſoever they die, it ſhall be well with them. To ſuch as theſe there will be a dreadfull change. What thou that didſt not doubt, or feare thy condition, no not to the laſt gaſpe to fall from theſe great hopes into eternal deſpair, What a change is here made? Our Saviour did moſt fully repreſent ſuch perſons in the Parable of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> Matth. 25. 11, 12. Did not they goe out confidently to meet the bridegroome? Did not they cry boldly, Lord, Lord, open to us? And yet when they came to the laſt, they wanted oile. Oh the multitude of thoſe perſons who want oil, yet live confidently, and die confidently, making no queſtion, but that the Lord will open to let them in! So in another Parable in the ſame Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44. Thoſe perſons whom the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh take heed of this ſelfe-fulneſſe, of living and dying in ſuch ſtrong preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods love, for hell and damnation will be ſo much the more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, by how much thou didſt make ſure of Heaven in thy owne expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Uſe from this Doctrine muſt needs be full of power and efficacy to move us. Imagine a wicked man ſentenced at that Tribunal, taking his leave of all comforts, wiſhing he had never been borne, crying out to the mountaines and hils to cover him, and then ſay, Did this man once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it would be thus with him? Did this man ever thinke there would be ſuch a change? Now is it not Gods mercy to fore-warne thee of this day? Neither Devil, or the world, neither God or man can be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but thy owne wilfulneſſe in ſinning. When thou art commanded to depart into everlaſting fire, never to enjoy a drop of comfort more, How muſt thou juſtifie God, the Miniſters, and thy owne godly friends, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

confuſion to thy ſelf? Shall we not heare thee ſpeaking to God, O glorious and infinite God, thou haſt beene mercifull and patient to me! Thou gaveſt me time to repent! Thou didſt fore-warne of this torment! I muſt juſtifie thee! Then we ſhall heare him ſpeaking to Chriſt, Oh bleſſed and glorious Mediatour, though not ſo to me, How great was thy love in dying for ſinners? How much was I convinced, that it was my duty to depart from my ſinnes, but my luſts would not let me? After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſhall juſtifie the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and godly friends, How often was I admoniſhed? I remember what you ſaid to me; I was convinced, I had no reaſon to doe as I did, it was my owne rebellious heart that hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done me.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He ſpeaketh to the <hi>glorified Saints,</hi> Oh happy and thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are ye! How unſpeakably glorious and comfortable is your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I remember the holy life, the godly examples you gave me, but my wretched luſts would not let me follow you, and now I muſt ſee your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces no more. Farewell all joy, all comfort; brimſtone, fire, torments, and hell flames are to be my portion for ever! Where is thy reaſon? Where is thy faith that doth not make thee watch and pray againſt this day? Why doeſt thou not with <hi>Hierome</hi> thinke that every moment thou heareſt that Trumpet ſounding in thy eares, <hi>Ariſe, and come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Oh be diligent in doing the Lord: <hi>For bleſſed is that ſarvant whom his Maſter ſhall finde him ſo doing!</hi> Whereas if thou art doing the Devils worke, he will at that day come and demand thee, he is mine, I challenge him for my owne; though I never died for him, though I was never crucified for him, yet he obeyed me rather than Chriſt; therefore I require my owne.

               <p>AT this Verſe the Apoſtle taketh an happy occaſion for a tranſition to his Apology, or defence againſt that crime charged upon him, by the falſe Teachers; <hi>Non ſaltat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cajetan, he doth not leap,</hi> falling upon this matter abruptly, but the tranſition is very genuine. <hi>Paul,</hi> it ſeemeth, had promiſed to come to thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but for weighty reaſons he deferred his coming hitherto. The falſe Teachers, they waiting for all advantages to calumniate him, did upon this accuſe him with levity and inconſtancy, that with him was yea and nay, that he did purpoſe according to carnal reſpects, accommodating himſelf to time, and outward advantages. Now the Apoſtle is very zealous and vehement in vindicating of himſelf herein. It is true, <hi>Piſcator</hi> doth begin this Apologetical Diſcourſe at the 12th Ver. but it ſeemeth more genuine to make the beginning of it at this verſe. <hi>Estius</hi> doth well obſerve, that while <hi>Paul</hi> was ſpeaking in the commendation and praiſe of his Converſation, he did uſe the plural number, joyning others with him, to avoid envy; but when he cometh to this Apologetical part, being charged with a heynous crime, he uſeth the ſingular Number, and ſpeaketh of himſelf onely.</p>
               <p>In the words we may take notice:</p>

               </p>
               <p>And 5. <hi>The Manner,</hi> how it was to be executed.</p>
               <p>In the Verſe following his <hi>Reſolution</hi> is ſet down in theſe words: <hi>I was minded to come unto you;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it ſignifieth ſuch a <hi>Reſolution,</hi> and purpoſe, that was made upon good advice and deliberation; It was not a raſh, ſuddain, or preſumptuous Decree, but made upon good grounds, though afterwards he had cauſe to change his minde. From this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſome ſay the word <hi>Bulla</hi> is derived, as being his wiſe decree and purpoſe; but ſeldome is there either wiſdome or righteouſneſs therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>motive in this confidence,</hi> viz. which was mentioned before of their mutual rejoycing in one another, whereby he was perſwaded, that he might do much good amongſt them: we have ſpoken of the word already. This he ſpeaketh, to ſhew that the motive of his coming to them was wholly out of love and deſire to do them good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Time</hi> when, and that is, <gap reason="foreign">

coming to him, as if this coming ſhould have been long before; but there is no great matter in either conſtruction, though <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> go the former way. If you ſay, Did the Apoſtle then change his mind? did he alter his purpoſe? if ſo, would not this call in queſtion all his Apoſtolical Doctrine? To this we are to anſwer in the proſecution of his Apology at the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe; he there plainly telleth them what was the cauſe that made him forbear his comming, not any levity or inconſtancy in him, but their ſinfulneſs: It was, that he might not execute that Apoſtolicall ſeverity amongſt them, as they deſerved, of which, in its time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There is the <hi>End</hi> of his coming, which is wholly ſpiritual, <hi>That you might have a ſecond benefit;</hi> It was for their good, not his own. Let us conſider the Motive <hi>in this confidence,</hi> of your kindneſs and love, as alſo, of my doing good to you. I purpoſed <hi>to come to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve;</p>
               <p>That <hi>where a Faithfull Miniſter hath good hopes and confidence of doing good</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Where a Faithfull Miniſter hath hopes of doing good, he hath good encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to remain.</note> 
                  <hi>to a people, there is great encouragement of abiding with ſuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it was with theſe very <hi>Corinthians:</hi> God, in a Viſion to <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 18. 10. commanded him to ſtay at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and not be afraid, which he did a year and half, longer then uſually he did any where; and the reaſon is, Becauſe there was much people in that City to be gathered to God. Oh how rejoycing is it to a Faithfull Miniſter, when he ſeeeth God hath converting work, edifying work for him to do amongſt ſuch a people? Thus you have alſo <hi>Paul</hi> reſolved upon his tarrying at <hi>Epheſus, 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 9. and why ſo? <hi>A great and effectual door is opened to me.</hi> He did ſee a likelihood of much ſpiritual good to be done, and this made him willing to abide there. To affect our hearts with this truth, conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That all people, both by nature and cuſtome have a door faſt bolted againſt the entrance of the Word.</hi> So that, it is as great a miracle, for Chriſt, by the <note place="margin">1. All people naturally have a door bolted againſt Chriſt.</note> preaching of the Goſpel to enter into the hearts of Hearers, as it was, when he came in to his Diſciples, the doors being ſhut; yea here is a door upon a door, a bolt upon a bolt. There is firſt their native corruption, and by this they are dead in ſin; So that our Preaching is like hooting into the ear of a dead man, ſhould not the ſpirit of God change and prepare the hearts of Hearers. This is the inward door; and then there is an outward door, which is Cuſtome and Continuance in ſinning, and this alſo hardeneth againſt the Miniſtry. Therefore people are to tremble under this contrariety to their own ſpiritual good. Remember, that as you have a door ſhut now againſt the Goſpel, ſo God will one day have a door ſhut againſt you in the Kingdome of Heaven: ſo that, although you ſhall cry <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> yet it cannot be granted you, <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 25. As much intreating as we make to you now to receive the Lord Chriſt, ſo much will you one day uſe that Chriſt would receive you. Now we knock, and cry, and importune that you open the doors of your heart; and then you ſhall howl and cry to Chriſt to open the doors and gates of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe men are thus ſhut up againſt the Word; hence it is, that neither any tractableneſs, or ſuppoſed probity in any people, nor the admirable</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Tis the grace of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> alone that can open this door.</note> 
                  <hi>gifts, and efficacious parts of a Miniſtry: but the powerfull grace of God alone is that which doth open the doors of mens hearts.</hi> Not any tractableneſs in people, therefore the <hi>Socinian,</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine is with indignation to be excluded, who ſpeak of a <hi>probitas naturalis,</hi> and <hi>ingenium docile;</hi> a natural teachableneſs in ſome perſons, which doth prepare them for the Goſpel, and that is the reaſon why ſome are converted by the word, and not others: yea, they are not afraid to offer violence to that Text; which doth ſo evidently
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:48709:258"/>
witneſs againſt them, <hi>Act. 13. 48. As many as were ordained to eternal life believed. The word,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they would wreſt to ſignifie ſome inward Diſpoſition, and Qualification, men that had fitted themſelves: But certainly, If God ſo often tell the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that he gave them not that rich Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> becauſe of their Righteouſneſs, or, for that they were better than others; can we think, Heaven and Salvation, which was typified by that <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſhall be obtained by our own worth? Nay, experience telleth us, that ſometimes the moſt prophane have received the Goſpel, when others more civilized and moralized have been great enemies to it. If any have Humility and Meckneſs, which is neceſſary for the ſucceſs of the Goſpel, in his heart, that is the gift of God, it floweth not from nature. Neither Secondly, is it any thing in the <hi>excellent gifts</hi> of any men, though they could preach with the tongue of Angels. Though the Apoſtles were deſigned by Chriſt to be leaven to leaven the whole World, to be ſalt to ſeaſon all people, yet too many here as the favour of death; and ſome were the more enraged, and made more obſtinate in fin, by how much the more affectionate he was to do them good. Yet the Miniſtry, though of it ſelf it cannot roll away this ſtone, or open this door of mens hearts, is not therefore uſeleſs: God hath appointed to convert by it. We muſt not out of Pride refuſe to waſh in this <hi>Jordan,</hi> as <hi>Naaman</hi> at firſt did, thinking other waters as good; I mean, to think, that ſtayiug at home, and reading of good Books, is as profitable; becauſe this is to neglect the inſtituted means by God; and it is juſt, that it thou do not ſeek God, where he is to be found, that thou ſhalt never finde him there where thou ſeekeſt him. Though this be ſo, yet it is God that openeth the door of mens hearts; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>An effectual door was opened,</hi> in a paſſive fear: he doth not ſay, I have opened it. Hence Chriſt ſpeaketh from heaven to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Rev. 3. 7, 8. I have ſet before thee an open door, and no man can ſhut it.</hi> When Chriſt will open the hearts of people, as he did <hi>Lydia's</hi> all the rage and violence of the Devil cannot hinder it. How many men are wrought upon, that, of all in the world you would not have exſpected it? who would have thought ſuch bears ſhould be turned into ſheep? Thus God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continueth a Miniſtry to a people, which doth a world of good: when there are many perſecutors, many enemies, men that have uſed all their fraud and power to remove it, and could not any more ſtirr it, then they could mountains. While God hath converting or ſaving work to do by a Miniſter, though it be but for one ſoul, though all the reſt ſhould maliciouſly conſpire againſt him, yet they do imagine things in vain. Obſerve that I place already mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor. 16. 9. An effectual door was opened, and their were many Adverſaries.</hi> There was a large door opened for all that. It is true, we have that Expreſſion even in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Rev. 3. 20. Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, and if any man open unto me,</hi> &amp;c. But that place onely implyeth our duty, what we are bound to do, not our ability. He that knocketh muſt alſo open the door, although the will is not forced in this, but God hath inſuperable power over it, whereby he can make it of unwilling willing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It may fall out ſometimes that God calleth a man to preach to a people concerning whom their is none or little hope of doing any good.</hi> Now ſuch who are thus <note place="margin">3. Sometimes Miniſters are called to a people of ſmall hopes.</note> called muſt continue in their ſlation, obeying the will of God, though they ſee they labour in vain. This was <hi>Iſayes</hi> caſe, Ch. 6. <hi>when he is commanded by his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the eyes of the people blinde, their hearts heavy.</hi> It was alſo <hi>Ezekiels</hi> caſe, Cha. 3. 7. <hi>But the houſe of Iſrael will not hearken unto thee, for they will not hearken unto me, for all the houſe of Iſrael are impudent and hard hearted,</hi> ſo Cha. 2. 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</hi> Thus a Miniſter, lawfully called to a people, muſt not preſently think of departing from them, becauſe of the little hope that he hath to do good, but muſt patiently and conſtantly wait upon the Lord in his way. The caſe of a Miniſters removeal
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:48709:259"/>
from a people is of great difficulty and tenderneſs: The cauſes of his departure may be either <hi>Internal,</hi> which God onely knoweth; as, Whether it be a pure Zeal to Gods glory, or ſome carnal and ſiniſter reſpect: or <hi>External,</hi> and thoſe <hi>externally</hi> may be either by ſome powerfull and cogent Providence of God, as ſome think, in the Plague; or perſonal Perſecution of the Miniſter, or by the command of Superiours, or for want of Maintenance, or where he cannot have his health; or hy a voluntary diſmiſſion of the people; or Laſtly, when there is a manifeſt Oppoſition generally againſt the Miniſtry, ſo that the madneſs and malice of the people force him away. Thus our Saviour commandeth, <hi>Matth. 10. 14. Whoſoever ſhall not reteive you, when ye depart out of that city, ſhake off the duſt of the feet:</hi> Thereby to ſignifie, ſay ſome, ſo God would at laſt caſt off ſuch a people, with as much abhorrency, as we do the duſt of our feet: or elſe, thereby to declare, that all the labour and pains they had been at, ſhould one day give in Teſtimony againſt them. Thus we read <hi>Act. 13. 21. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhook off the duſt off their feet againſt the perſecuting and unbelieving <hi>Jews.</hi> And Verſe 46. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh boldly to them, <hi>Seeing ye put the word of God from you, and judg your ſelves unworthy of Eternall life, lo we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> Thus You ſee there may be weighty Cauſes of a Miniſters Removeal. For they are two rigid, who think the Union between Paſtor and people is indiſſoluble, like that of marriage: Yet among all the Cauſes, nothing is ſo clear, as when a when a people, by their wickedneſs and Oppoſition do perſecute and drive him away; or when they are too refractory to the Orders of Chriſt, that he cannot with a good conſcience exerciſe all Miniſterial duties amongſt them. But, though this be ſo, The frowardneſs and unprofitableneſs of a people muſt not immediately make them take up ſuch Reſolutions; they muſt ſhew much Conſtancy and ſelf-denial, uſing all means to recover them. For ſeeing it is God that giveth the encreaſe, though we plant and water, and his time is unknown to us, it may fall out, that a people, who give no hope for the preſent, may afterwards appear more curable; and the ſeed that is now ſown, thou for the preſent it may ſeem buried, yet afterwards it may grow up. Therefore we are to imitate God himſelf, who uſeth much Patience and Forbearance even to the vileſt men, thereby to allure them to Repentance. This counſel alſo <hi>Paſl</hi> giveth <hi>Timothy,</hi> as a Miniſter of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 25. In meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe, if peradventure God will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.</hi> Though then hopes of doing good to a people is a great Encouragement to co continue with them, yet a people that appear incurable for the preſent, are not to be immediately abandoned, becauſe the times of ſucceſs are in Gods hand; and ſometimes Perſecutors are at laſt made Lovers, and imbracers of the truth. Beſides, we ſee the Prophet quieting his heart with this, though he had no ſucceſs in his Miniſtry, that he had his reward with God, <hi>Iſay 49. 5. Though Iſrael be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the eyes of God.</hi> Such as are deſpiſed and contemned in the eyes of men, ſhall be glorious in the eyes of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This confidence, and hope of doing good muſt not depend upon a mans own apprehenſions, but muſt be guided by the word of God.</hi> So deceitfull and corrupt <note place="margin">4. A Miniſters hope of doing good ſhould be guided by the Word.</note> is the heart of a man, that many times it flattereth it ſelf, and when a man ſeeketh his own advantage, yet he may perſwade himſelf, that it is confidence, and hope of doing good, Therefore to know when their is more hope of doing good in one place than in another, muſt not be decided by ſelfiſh and private deſires, but by general Rules fetched out of Gods Word, and indeed, becauſe all ſucceſs of Miniſterial Labours lyeth wholly upon the good Grace of God, and the Word is bleſſed ſometimes to one people, not ſo likely; and at another time not to a people more likely. Therefore the will of God is very difficultly diſcovered in ſuch caſes; which ſheweth, with how much ſincerity and fervency
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:48709:259"/>
God is to be ſought unto at ſuch times. Now the Reaſons are palpable, <hi>Why Confidence in a Miniſter to do good to a people ſhould be a matter not onely</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why a Miniſters hope of doing good ſhould be matter of of joy to him. 1. The End of his Miniſtry is accompliſhed.</note> 
                  <hi>of continuance, but of ſtudying, and diligent improving all his Miniſterial Labours with the greater joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>the End of his Miniſtry is hereby accompliſhed.</hi> When the Diſciples had fiſhed all the day, and caught nothing, they were diſheartened; but when Chriſt bid them throw the net in again, and they brought up a multitude, this made them rejoyce, even to amazement. If the Husbandman is at much coſt and pains about his ground, and that bring forth nothing but bryars and thornes, Is not that a diſheartening? If a Phyſician ſee that no Potions, no Medicines he giveth, ever do any good, will not that make him weary of his imployment? How much more, if a Miniſter labour in vain, Preach in vain, Admoniſh in vain, and ſtill people grow more ohdurate in their ſinnes? Doth not this teach them, with <hi>Jonah,</hi> even to run from their work?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is great matter of rejoycing where this hope is, becauſe Succeſs in the Ministry is above all Succeſſes.</hi> Herein the Souls of men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. In this is contained our everlaſting Happineſs. Oh that men ſhould be no more ſollicitous in this than they are. How few do examine what fruit the Word preached hath upon them; whether it be a ſuſtaining Word, or an hardening; Whether it be the ſavour of life, or the ſavour of death? That Ark which brought ſo much bleſſing to <hi>Obedmelech,</hi> and his Family; to the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> was cauſe of grievous Plagues. And thus the ſame Sermons that are life to one, may be darkneſs to others; that are light to one, may be darkneſs to another. If then the Miniſter ſhall ſee his work like to proſper in the end it is ſent for, here is greater cauſe to rejoyce, then in any outward bleſſing whatſoever; for this is of everlaſting conſequence.</p>
               <p>Let the Uſe be of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to you to be a people of good Confidence, that our Miniſteriall Labours ſhall not be in vain; That we do not in vain preach to you, or pray for you. Can there be a greater grief to the Miniſter, yea and provocation of God, than to be like that ground the Scripture ſpeaketh of, <hi>Heb. 6. 8?

ſometimes in Scripture applyed to ſuch Almes as were freely given for the uſe of diſtreſſed Churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. which is therefore called <hi>Grace,</hi> partly becauſe it is of Gods ſpecial goodneſs to give us ſuch a free and liberal Diſpoſition, as the firſt Verſe in that Chapter implyeth, <hi>I do you to wit</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) of the grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia:</hi> and that was to be liberal to the other afflicted Saints: and partly becauſe it cometh from the bountifull diſpoſition of a man to ſuch as are in want. In this Text it is to be applyed to <hi>ſpiritual bounty,</hi> that is, to be willing and ready in all ſerviceableneſs to promote the ſpirituall good of others; for there are ſpiritual almes, as well as temporal, which lieth in reproof, in Admonition, and frequent Exhortation to what is good. Now this Grace or Benefit is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſome tranſlate, <hi>iterated,</hi> and <hi>repeated,</hi> though it be more than the Second, or third time. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> referreth it to his Epiſtles, and his preſence: for by both theſe he communicated <hi>ſpiritual benefit</hi> unto them. But it is moſt probably and generally referred to his firſt and ſecond coming: whether <hi>Paul</hi> did come a third time to thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> is diſputed by Commentators, becauſe of ſome paſſages in the 12 and 13 Chapters of this Epiſtle: of which in its time. It is enough, that by the firſt <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>benefit,</hi> we mean the firſt work upon them by <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry, when they were converted from their Paganiſm, and planted a Church of Chriſt. And the ſecond benefit was, to confirm them in the ſame Faith, and alſo to quicken them up unto further degrees of Holineſs: and this was the ſecond Benefit <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to impart unto them. For it appeareth, that though this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a garden planted by <hi>Paul,</hi> yet many weeds, and ſome poyſonous ones began to grow up amongſt them; There were both in Doctrine and Manners many things amiſs, which needed <hi>Pauls</hi> preſence to reforme. Obſerve</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is not enough to be a Church planted, and gathered from out of the world at firſt, but there needeth a conſtant and dayly Miniſtry to be tilling and dreſſing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A conſtant Miniſtry is neceſſary to every Church.</note> 
                  <hi>of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Garden which God planted, and put <hi>Adam</hi> into, yet was to be dayly dreſſed; and ſo it is ſtill with the beſt Churches, even thoſe that are of the Apoſtolical Plantation, yet needed the Apoſtles care and diligent viſitations, which was one main cauſe of writing thoſe ſeveral Epiſtles to ſeveral Churches. They were not written to convert them, or make them Churches, but to admoniſh, inſtruct, or confirm and comfort, as occaſion did require; and upon this ground it is, that though the office of Apoſtles and Prophets, as alſo the gift of miracles are now ceaſed, becauſe the Church is now planted, yet the office of Paſtors, and the Ordinances Chriſt hath inſtituted, are perpetual, and muſt be continued to the end of the world. So that the opinion of the <hi>Socininians</hi> about the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> as it were, only a thing of order, and not of Divine Inſtitution, is groſly repugnant to Gods Word; as alſo their Doctrine about <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> That it was but a temporary Ceremony, inſtituted for the beginning of the Church, is full of falſhood. Churches though conſtituted, yet muſt be dayly watered: neither is it enough for a people once to be brought home to the Faith, but they need a ſecond and a third, yea a continual <hi>benefit.</hi> For though the Apoſtle haply did come but the ſecond time to theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yet he appointed Officers in an ordinary reſidence amongſt them, as wel as in other Churches, which were continually to watch over them.</p>
               <p>The particulars wherein the Miniſtry is neceſſary for perfecting work, as well as foundation work, for progreſs as well as ingreſs, for conſummation as well as <note place="margin">And that for theſe Ends 1. To informe againſt Errors.</note> imitation, are theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To inform againſt thoſe Errors which falſe Teachers do eaſily inſinuate
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:48709:261"/>
into the hearts of people.</hi> No ſooner hath God ſowed his field with precious wheat, but the envious one commeth, and ſoweth his tares. As the April ſhowers, that make graſs and flowers to come, cauſe alſo weeds to grow: Thus at the ſame time God is building the Church, the Devil and his inſtruments are raiſing their <hi>Babel.</hi> No ſooner have the Miniſters of God with <hi>Iſaac</hi> digged up Wells, but the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> have been ready to throw their earth and mud therein. If then Errors and damnable Hereſies may ſo quickly infect a Church, formerly pure; no wonder if there be ſuch neceſſity of Paſtors, and Guides, who are to lead the people into all truth by their Miniſtry, as the ſpirit of God doth by his efficacy. You may obſerve in moſt of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, which are like watering of the Garden, after it is planted, How much care and inſpection is uſed againſt thoſe falſe Teachers? how greatly he labours to antidote them againſt falſe Doctrines: ſo that, it is a wonder, that any who read <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, and obſerve his diligence and zeal therein, can look upon Errors as almoſt innocency, and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pitty rather than indulgence. <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel you are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you, to another Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So ſoon,</hi> Thoſe <hi>Galatians</hi> that had received ſuch wonderfull gifts by the Preaching of the Goſpel, yet even to the admiration of <hi>Paul</hi> are ſuddenly carried aſide into falſe wayes. This then is a continual benefit by a faithfull and ſound Miniſtry, that we be not as <hi>Children, toſſed up and down with every winde of Doctrine, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14. That we be ſoundly fortifyed againſt all the deceiveable wayes of Errors; and truely this is a ſpecial mercy, to have a Miniſtry ſanctified to that end, and bleſſed to that purpoſe, to keep thee in a ſound and right judgment. Therefore is it that the Devil placeth his engines againſt the Miniſtry, to batter that down: for, if the wall be broken down, the city may be eaſily taken: if the hedg be trampled down, the corne will preſently be ſpoyled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Miniſterial labours are neceſſary to a conſtituted Church, in respect of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. To reform the corruptions that are in mens lives.</note> 
                  <hi>all the effectual means it is to uſe againſt thoſe corruptions, and abuſes in mens manners which may ſoon break forth.</hi> And thus it was with this Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> Their lives were greatly corrupted, there were many diſorders, They did not walk with ſuch an holly reſpect to the Rule as they ought to do: ſome fell into groſs ſinnes of wantonneſs, and had not yet repented, or manifeſted any true humiliation; others they were carried away with pride and envy, whereby many parties and Factions were made amongſt them. Now, where there were ſo many diſeaſes did they not need a Phyſician? when the School was thus diſordered was not a rod requiſite? Although the Churches of God have glorious Titles, yet they ſeldome exactly anſwer to them in their lives. They are called <hi>Believers,</hi> but how apt to misbelieve, to be carried away with the ſlighly cunning of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical men? They are called Saints, but how apt to be carnal, paſſionate, worldly; yea and ſometimes to be overtaken with groſſer ſinnes? Now they that are thus overtaken, do they not <hi>need thoſe that are ſpiritual</hi> Gal. 6. 1. <hi>to reſtore them again?</hi> By the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> here ſome underſtand the Officers and Guides of the Church, who, as they were to caſt out obſtinate and impenitent ſinners, ſo to receive them again upon their humiliation, in the ſpirit of meekneſs, to Church-communion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Miniſterial Labors are neceſſary in an iterated and repeated manner,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. To comfort the godly.</note> 
                  <hi>for conſolation and incouragement.</hi> The people of God have a two fold occaſion of their ſadneſs and diſcouragement; the former whereof is, From their ſinnes and faillings; they are wholly ſtrangers to their ond hearts, but diſcover that vileneſs and loathſomeneſs in themſelves, which the world can not, which God onely knoweth; and ſometimes this fire is inraged qy the oyl that the Devil poureth on, he hath his <hi>fiery darts,</hi> he hath his buffetings. Now, when any of the children of God ſit in this darkneſs, how neceſſary, how welcome are the feet of thoſe who bring the <hi>glad tydings of the Gospel!</hi> Had not even Chriſt himſelf in the midſt of his ſorrow an <hi>Angel</hi> ſent to comefort him? The Inceſtuous perſon, was not he
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:48709:261"/>
ready to be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 Cor, 2. 7. <hi>to forgive him, and to comfort him.</hi> Hence God doth reprove thoſe negligent Shepherds, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 34. 4. that groſly failed in this duty, <hi>The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrengthened, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, or bound up that which was broken.</hi> For this end alſo God doth give his Officers a <hi>tongue of the learned,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> calleth it, Chap. 50. 4. which is, <hi>to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon, to him that is of an humble ſpirit, and wearied ſoul.</hi> Little do any know the neceſſity of ſuch comfortable Phyſicians, but ſuch who like the man of <hi>Jerecho</hi> lie wounded with the ſenſe of their own guilt, and Gods diſpleaſure againſt them. For alas, in our temptations we are not able to give true comefort to our ſelves, it is well if we be inabled through grace to receive it from others. In muddied waters a man cannot diſcern his own face; ſo neither in ſuch black temptations is a Chriſtian able to ſee how it ſtandeth between God and his own ſoul. Therefore as the Spirit of God doth efficiently both convince of ſin and comfort, ſo doth the Miniſtry inſtrumentally, being applyed therunto by the Spirit of God. A Second occaſion of comfort, is in regard of the outward <hi>perſecutions</hi> and <hi>troubles</hi> which do accompany the powerfull Profeſſion of the Goſpel: ſo that, in reſpect of external conſiderations, they are of all men moſt miſerable; Are not they therefore to have ſuch as may comfort and ſtrengthen them in their warfare? Hence <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles do abound with many conſolations, as ſo many cordialls: <hi>Peter</hi> alſo in his Epiſtles doth give notable encouragements not to faint under the afflictions they meet with for the Goſpells ſake; yea to rejoyce in it, and to account themſelves happy becauſe of it. This comfort is alwayes neceſſary; but becauſe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dly are never free from the perſecution of the hand, or of the tongue, the Miniſters of God, they are to follow Chriſt in this: as he informed his Diſciples of the hatred they ſhould meet with in the world, ſo he comforteth them, he commands them to be of good courage, he had overcome the world.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>The labour of the Miniſtry is again and again to be put forth to a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. To edifie and ſtrengthen them.</note> 
                  <hi>people, though under the profeſſion of Chriſt; becauſe of their growth and edification in the wayes of holineſs.</hi> And this indeed is one of the principal effects of the Miniſtry upon a people already converted. They that ſay or think they need no Miniſtry, no Preaching, may with that <hi>Novatian</hi> take a ladder, and go themſelves up into heaven. It is as if a Graden ſhould ſay, it needeth no rain; a field of corn, it needeth not the clouds, to be without which, is in Scripture, a great judgment. This God threateneth, <hi>Iſay</hi> chap. 6. 6. <hi>I will alſo command my clouds to rain no more rain upon it.</hi> Thus ſome men wilfully put themſelves into that condition, to live without a Miniſtry, as a Mercy, which God maketh a grievous Curſe. That growth in Chriſtianity is a principal end of the Miniſtry appeareth <hi>Epheſ. 4. 12. For the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we come to a full ſtature.</hi> Inſomuch that all Miniſters and all hearers have work enough to do. None can ſay, we have Preached enough, or heard enough, becauſe none believe enough, none love enough, none are heavenly enough.</p>
               <p>Several wayes the beſt Hearers may grow;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In the amplitude of their knowledg.</hi> They may know more things in <note place="margin">How believers may and are to grow. 1. In knowledg.</note> Chriſtianity than they did: for ſeing <hi>we know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. this light in our mind may ſtill encreaſe more and more; not indeed in more neceſſaries and Fundamentalls, for then none could be ſaved, becauſe ſtill ignorant of ſome Fundamental or other; but in the Additionalls and Superſtructures, which have alſo a ſpecial uſe and efficacy to carry on the work of Salvation. Even a Godly man may live in many Errors, in many ſinnes, and not know them to be ſo; as we ſee in many Ages, when clearer light hath diſcovered that to be Superſtition, and a diſhonour to God, which was accounted once the great, onour due unto him. When God diſpelled the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs of Popery from of the face of
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:48709:262"/>
the face of the Church, their Image-Worſhip, their Indulgences, their vowed Obedience and poverty, which were admired as ſuch eminent acts of Religion, were manifeſted to be contemptible, as having no foundation upon the Scripture, and alſo very injurious to the Offices of Chriſt; and in how many things do the beſt of men ſtill continue ignorant? and therefore with <hi>David</hi> (though he had <hi>more underſtadding than his teachers)</hi> are to pray, that <hi>God would open their eyes, that they might underſtand the wonderfull things of Gods law,</hi> Pſal. 119. 18, <hi>Davids</hi> eyes were opened, yet they muſt be opened more; all the ſcales are not fallen from his eyes: and therefore the Apoſtle prayeth for thoſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> whoſe underſtandings were already enlightened, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17. that <hi>their eyes might yet be more opened:</hi> and <hi>that God would give unto them the ſpirit of wiſdome, and revelation in the knowledg of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By the Ministry they are to grow in the efficacy and experimental power of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. In the experimental power of their knowledge.</note> 
                  <hi>their knowledg.</hi> For theſe two differ exceedingly; men may grow much in ſpeculative knowledg, underſtand controverſies in Divinity, and diſpute much about the Doctrines of the times that are agitated; but unleſs a man grow in the ſavoury power of it, he is but a <hi>tinkling cymbal:</hi> if he do notgrow in the love of the truth, if that knowledg doth not make him more pure, more ſanctified, more reformed, this will turn to his greater condemnation. Therefore <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. Its called <hi>the acknowledging of the truth, which is after godlineſs. Savanarola,</hi> Hom. 3. p. 29. bringeth a diſtruction of Divinity out of <hi>Aquinas</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>a man may know a thing,</hi> ſaith he, either <hi>per modum ſtudii,</hi> or <hi>per modum incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis:</hi> men may know many things <hi>by way of ſtudy</hi> in Divinity, and yet not have the leaſt knowledg of them <hi>by way of inclination</hi> to love and delight in them. May not a man have obtained much diſcourſive knowledg about Chriſt, in reſpect of his Perſon and Offices, as to be able to confute <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> yet be far from that heavenly inclination which <hi>Paul</hi> found in himſelf, <hi>to know nothing but Chriſt crucified, and to judg all things dung and droſs in compariſon of this knowledg?</hi> That knowledg then which doth bring a ſavoury taſt, and experimental inclination to the good things we know, that is to be imbraced, that we are to grow in more every day. He that knoweth a Country or a City by a Map, cannot be ſo affected as he that hath really ſeen it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We may by the Miniſtry have a continued benefit in respect of the firmneſs</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In Faith</note> 
                  <hi>and ſtrength of our faith.</hi> It is noted ſometimes of the Diſciples, that upon ſome miracle that was wrought by our Sauiour, that then they believed. Not but that they did ſo before, onely their Faith was then more ſtrengthened, and confirmed; and truly this firmneſs of Faith, this ſteadfaſtneſs of it, is a precious Antidote againſt all fickle and ſceptical Opinions: Men do not grow in Faith but fancy; and that maketh inconſtancy in Religion. How can a man be a Martyr for Chriſts truth? now can he loſe all he hath, rather than deny it, unleſs he have this quieting and ſatisfying work of Faith upon the ſoul? Hence <hi>Faith</hi> is called, <hi>Heb. 11. 1. The ſubstance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Thoſe two words <hi>ſubstance</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> do denote the great power that Faith ought to have upon the ſoul. Again, this firmneſs of Faith is not onely ſeen in dogmatical Aſſent, but in in fiducial Application of the Promiſes to our ſelves, in which ſenſe it is ſaid twice or thrice, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> Such are the weak actings of our Faith, ſo ſtrong are our temptations, ſo ſupernatural and myſterious is this way of believing, that all have cauſe to cry out with the Apoſtles, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The beſt hearers need the Miniſtry for increaſe in Godlineſs, to grow in grace more.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, writeing to thoſe whom he ſuppoſeth as converted <note place="margin">4. In Grace.</note> already, yet exhorteth to <hi>put off the old man, and put on the new. To be renewed in the ſpirit of their minde,</hi> Epeſ. 4. 23. 24. And our Saviour prayeth for the Apoſtles even in that Prayer wherein he acknowledgeth that they had believed,

and received the word of God. That <hi>they were not of the world,</hi> John 17. 17 That God would <hi>ſanctifie them by his word,</hi> which is to be underſtood of the progreſs therein. There is no Doctrine ſo practically oppoſite to the Scripture as that of Perfection; for every where the Godly are commanded to <hi>grow,</hi> to be <hi>mortifying the body of ſin,</hi> to be <hi>perfecting holineſs;</hi> which were ridiculous Exhortations, if we had already attained Perfection. Hence we are compared to thoſe who run in a race, and therefore till death, do not come to our prize. Thus where the Miniſter may have little to do in reſpect of Converſion, it may have very much to do in reſpect of Edification. And the Godly are to Examine, whether every Sabbath day the Miniſter doth not come with a new benefit, a new advantage to them: look for a new grace and favour in every new Sermon. And ſo we proceed to the Uſe, which is, of Inſtruction,</p>
               <p>What all people ſhould look at under the Miniſtry; Spiritual advantages, ſpiritual light, ſpiritual heat, ſpiritual quickenings. As where Chriſt went up and down he healed their diſeaſed people, ſo where the word of God is preached, it ſhould heal ſoul-diſeaſes. Thou art not to have the Pride, the paſſions, the worldly cares as thou uſeſt to have: but, oh how rare are ſuch Hearers! who aimeth at this? who prayeth for this in every Sermon he heareth? Oh fear leaſt ſome ſpiritual judgment upon thee deprive thee of this benefit. If an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had looked upon the <hi>Brazen ſerpent,</hi> and yet not be healed: If a diſeaſed perſon had ſtepped firſt in order into the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and yet not have been recovered; they would have been greatly troubled to ſee their hopes fruſtrated. No leſs ought it to make thee grieve and tremble, if thou finde that one Sermon paſſeth away after another, yet there is no ſpiritual benefit accrewing to thy ſoul thereby. But why do we ſpeak of <hi>ſpiritual Edification?</hi> in how many is not the ground-work of Converſion laid? how can they have the <hi>ſecond benefit,</hi> who have not obtained rhe firſt? How can they be nouriſhed and grow, who have not yet the Principles of Life infuſed into them?</p>
               <p>Two great things are then to be done by our Miniſtry through the grace of God.</p>
               <p>The Firſt, <hi>To Regenerate:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second is, <hi>To grow and increaſe</hi> in the work of Grace.</p>
               <p>If the foundation ſtone of this building be not laid, thou art yet in thy ruines and rubbiſh, thou art yet in thy ſinnes: Thou art to pray, and to deſire all others to pray, that God would have mercy upon thy ſoul, that he would take away thy ſtony heart, that he would heal thy blinde eyes, and open thy deaf eares. But if God hath brought thee into this ſpiritual eſtate, know there is a neceſſity to grow in grace, as well as to be in grace: and, that for progreſs herein God hath appointed his Miniſtry, and the Ordinances, Cry out then and ſay, Lord, not the Firſt time, but the Second and Third, yet all my life long make me to partake of this Heavenly Benefit.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>All Chriſtians, eſpecially Miniſters, ought to lay out themſelves wholly for Gods Glory, and others good.</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 16.</bibl>
                  <q>And to paſſe by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judea.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THis Text containeth the manner how <hi>Paul</hi> was to fulfill his purpoſe of coming to them, which was firſt to go to <hi>Macedonia;</hi> and upon a ſhort abiding there, then again, to come back to them, and to make a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continuance with them. For the ſtate of the Church of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was not ſo corrupt, as this of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and therefore needed not ſo long a reſidence of <hi>Paul</hi> there, as in this place. For our holy Apoſtle had his whole heart car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out in the ſervice of God, and therefore did order his journeys and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in any place, according as Gods glory, and the advantage of the Church might require it. So that when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh here of his travails, and ſetteth down as it were his ſeveral journeys, in all theſe he did not conſult with fleſh and blood, or look upon carnal advantages; but his aim in all is, to promote the Kingdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is one great difficulty which Commentators are exerciſed with concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Text, and that is, How to reconcile this paſſage with that which is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 5, 6, 7. where he ſaith, <hi>He would come to them after he had paſſed through Macedonia, and that he would not now ſee them by the way,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here he ſaith, <hi>he will,</hi> though afterwards he would come and abide with them: So that here ſeemeth to be a contrariety in his purpoſes. Some, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> and others, think therefore that this purpoſe in the Text, was either made in a former Epiſtle, which is now loſt, or ſent by a meſſenger to them: And that afterwards <hi>Paul</hi> for urging reaſons did alter his reſolution. And that this is ſpoken of in the former Epiſtle, which they ſay is the ſecond, though with us it be the firſt. Hence it's affirmed by ſome, that the Apoſtle wrote three Epiſtles to theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though we have but two. But it is the judgement of the moſt able Divines, That no part of the Canonical Scripture is loſt. They grant many books are now wanting, which ſome holy men did write, but of that which was by God appointed to be the Canon and Rule of our faith and manners none is periſhed. And indeed to hold that opinion, would open a door for many atheiſtical arguments; at leaſt it would gratifie the Popiſh party, who thinketh, if there were no Scripture, yet the Church and her traditions would be a ſtarre bright enough to guide us unto Heaven. Others
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:48709:263"/>
there are that grant in the former Epiſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had a contrary reſolution to this in the Text, and that it is no diſhonour to him to change his mind; for they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between matters of Doctrine, and matters of Fact. In matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they were alwayes guided by the Spirit of God: But in matters of Fact, ſometimes they did purpoſe according to humane conſiderations, but pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and rational; yet in the event were over-ruled to other things, then they purpoſed, by ſome new diſpenſations of Gods providence. Neither is this to be blamed, no not in wiſe men. For the Rule is, <hi>Sapientis eſt mut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re conſilium,</hi> new emergencies which the wiſdome of man could not fore-ſee, may cauſe new reſolutions. Now it's plain, that either <hi>Paul</hi> did wholly change his purpoſe, or elſe he did not fulfill it as ſoon as was expected by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which made them ſo calumniate him for inconſtancy and levity. And this anſwer may very well be juſtified; yet <hi>Muſculus</hi> doth at large ſhew, how both theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes may be reconciled, and that there is no contrariety in them, which is too long here to inſert.</p>
               <p>Let us come to obſerve ſome practical and profitable inſtructions from this Text, and from the general ſcope that <hi>Paul</hi> had in all this labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, which was to advance the glory of God, to promote the good of the Church, rejoycing like a Gyant to runne his race. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is the duty of all Chriſtians, and especially of Miniſters to lay out</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">'Tis the duty of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, eſpecially Miniſters to lay out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the glory of God.</note> 
                  <hi>themſelves for the glory of God, and good of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Paul</hi> admirable in this? See how he taketh one journey upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, travaileth from one Church to another; and all this is, that Chriſt might be exalted. Both godly Chriſtians and eſpecially Miniſters of the Goſpel, are to follow Chriſt in this, who went up and down preaching the Kingdome of God, and doing good whitherſoever he came. All his life was ſpent in doing the will of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us conſider it as the duty of all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their ſeveral places and <note place="margin">1. For all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> relations; and herein theſe things are conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>There is none, though in never ſo mean a condition, but hath ſeveral</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. There is none but have talents to be improved.</note> 
                  <hi>talents committed to him, which are to be imployed for the honour of God, and the good of others.</hi> The known Parable of the Talents doth ſufficiently confirm this. For though there be a great difference, ſome have five, and ſome have ten, and others but one or two, yet none are to ſit idle: And therefore in that Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 24. the inſtance of an unprofitable ſervant is made in him, who had but one Talent: we would have thought it would have gone worſe with thoſe who had more Talents; they were under many obligations, it would be very difficult to improve all. Doth not evperience teach us, that where a man hath many relations, and ſeveral truſts committed to him, how hard it is to be faithfull in all? Yet here in this Parable, he only is found unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and is adjudged unto a terrible doom, that had but <hi>one talent,</hi> and was negligent therin. Would not Chriſt teach us by this, that none ſhould ſlight their mean and low eſtate, thinking that ſuch are poor and inconſiderable creatures, as they are, alas, they can do nothing for God? It is for Magiſtrates and Miniſters, for rich men, or men in place, and of intereſt to lay out themſelves; but God doth not look they ſhould do any thing. Oh take heed of this temptation! If thou doeſt but ſet thy ſelf to conſider in this matter, thou mayeſt find thy ſelf in capacity to promote the glory of God, and to further the Goſpel of Chriſt in many particulars that thou art now negligent in. This is our great ſinne, that none are contented with the ſeveral relations and conditions they are in. One thinketh, if he were in ſuch a mans eſtate, he could ſerve God better than he
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:48709:264"/>
doth. The private Chriſtian thinketh a Miniſter can do it better: A Miniſter thinketh a private Chriſtian hath not the temptations and ſad eares that he hath. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>(Comment. in Gen. cap.</hi> 17.) of himſelf, how he thought other mens callings happier than his, who endured ſo much envy and hatred for the Goſpel, <hi>They live without vexations; their labour is ſweet, but I am exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with great dangers.</hi> But we muſt take heed of impatiency, and know we may all ſerve God, and ſo be at laſt ſaved in our reſpective lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. We would think the hands or feet were in a worſe condition than the tongue, for they are worn out with labour; whereas the tongue doth taſte of ſweet and pleaſant things, and is not w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aried with pain, and yet theſe partake of the ſame happineſs with the body, as the eyes or tongue do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This you alſo are to underſtand, that all the lawfull actions in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. All lawfull actions may be improved for Gods glory.</note> 
                  <hi>your ſeveral callings may be improved for Gods honour, as well as thoſe that are in their nature religious, and immediately applied to himſelf.</hi> Our plowing and ſowing, our marrying and bringing up of children, if done according to Scripture-rules, pleaſe God in their way, as well as religious duties: It may be holy plowing, holy ſowing, holy buying and ſelling, as well as holy praying and holy preaching. It is the Apoſtles command, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 31. Whether ye eat, or drinke, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> In Popery there was an horrible miſtake about this, which was the cauſe of bringing in much ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; which made <hi>Luther,</hi> as appeareth in his Comments on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſo often ſpeak of the good pleaſure that God taketh in the civil actions of our calling, when done out of obedience to Gods command. And indeed men are hardly perſwaded, that the doing of ſuch things in our relations, are ſerving of God; whereas all ſuch things done from good principles, and to right ends, are holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as other duties. <hi>Holineſſe to the Lord,</hi> is to be written upon all thy natural, civil and moral actions, as well as religious. It is true, here lieth the difficulty, to do theſe ordinary actions of our calling upon holy grounds; to eat, to drink, to labour, that God may be exalted, and not to make riches, gain, and outward bleſſedneſs the utmoſt end of all doings in this kind. So that till a man be regenerated, he is but a worm crawling upon the ground, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing but upon humane motives. And it is no wonder, for ſuch men in all their religious duties are but carnal and earthly; whether they pray or heare, it is not for the glory of God: Cuſtome, formality, and ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, are the Locuſts and Caterpillars, that do devour our hopefull buds. Therefore</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>It behoveth every Chriſtian often to meditate about the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Chriſtians ſhould often meditate upon the ultimate end of all their actions.</note> 
                  <hi>end of all his actions.</hi> As the <hi>Heathen</hi> would have a man ſay to himſelf, <hi>Cui bono, for what good is this I do?</hi> So much more ſhould believers propound this to themſelves; I labour, I take pains, I riſe early, I go to bed late; but to what end is all this? What is it that my ſoul doth principally aim at in all theſe things? If we had asked <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Paul, Why will you go to Macedonia?</hi> He would have ſaid, to promote Chriſts Kingdom, to have been beneficial to mens ſouls. And then again, <hi>Why to Corinth?</hi> It was to carry on the work of the Goſpel there. Many did begin to fall off, ſo that it was neceſſary there ſhould be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and admonition. And further, <hi>Why do you go to Jeruſalem?</hi> It is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the bowels of the poor Saints there. By which you ſee, that as the <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropium,</hi> that flower of the Sunne, doth follow the Sunne, and openeth and ſhutteth according to the preſence of the Sun, and its abſence. Thus doth the heart of <hi>Paul</hi> wholly move after God; divine conſiderations are the Loadſtone that drew out his heart. And indeed in all moral actions, the end is firſt to be concluded. Hence <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethicks</hi> beginneth with the end of humane actions. What is the white that all men are to ſhoot at? What is the mark they are to levell at? Whereupon ſome Divines likewiſe concluding, that Divinity is
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:48709:264"/>
practical and not ſpeculative meerly, that therefore the moſt approved and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine method in all Syſtems of Divinity, is, firſt to begin with that <hi>end,</hi> which all men ought to aim at in their whole life, and that is known to be the glory of God, and the ſalvation of our ſouls. Now when a man hath fixed his end, and reſolveth upon that, he doth all things proportionably and ſutably thereunto. Hence when a man acteth according to a Divine Rule: If you ask him, Why do you take ſuch pains? Why do you ride up and down, and travail ſo much? Why do you ſtudy and devour books? His anſwer will be, It is for Gods glory, and the ſalvation of my ſoul. Till therefore a man hath centered his ſoul upon the right end, till his heart be conſtantly upon that, he either propounds curſed and wicked ends to himſelf, or at the beſt he maketh intermedious ends ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that which is the ſecondary to be the principal. For it's lawfull to take pains, to be diligent in our calling, that our family may be provided for, our children be brought up; it were an unnatural and great ſinne to be negligent herein; but then you muſt remember, to make this a <hi>comma,</hi> not a <hi>colon:</hi> This muſt be your Inne, not your home, you muſt look beyond all theſe, even to God and your ſouls. This truth is ſo neceſſary, that though we ſhould preach ſix hundred Sermons about it, to quicken you up in the meditation thereof, it would not be uſeleſs: But I am not now to inſiſt upon it. The ſum is this, He that would both in ſoul and body, in health, wealth, parts, and all he hath, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for God, muſt often make this Queſtion to his ſoul, Oh my ſoul, what is thy end in all theſe things! What moveth thee to be thus diligent in thy wayes? What is it that is ſet moſt upon thy heart all the day long? For although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not continually have actual thoughts upon our chief end, yet we are to have an habitual and virtual inclination, from whence all is to come, that we do. Even as a perfect <hi>Grammarian</hi> ſpeaketh alwayes true Latine, from the habit within him, though happily he doth not actually think upon every rule in his <hi>Grammar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we told you, <hi>This acting and working for God in our whole</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Eſpecially it belongs to Miniſters.</note> 
                  <hi>life and callings, is more eminently to be fulfilled in the Miniſters of the Gospel.</hi> The name of a Biſhop is a name of labour, and not honour. The Miniſtry is, <hi>Negotiorum negotium,</hi> the work of all works; which made <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. All the title and names they have, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note diligence; labour, ſollicitude and conſtant perſeverance in the work of the Lord againſt all the cruel oppoſitions that the Devil and wicked men do raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Hence <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded, <hi>To endure hardſhip as a good ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 3, 4. and that he may diſcharge this faithfully, <hi>He muſt not entangle himſelf in the affairs of the world.</hi> All which ſheweth, that in a peculiar manner they are by their Miniſtry to diſpoſſeſs Satan of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: They are clouds to refreſh the dry ground, and to make it fruitfull. They are ſalt to ſeaſon thoſe who are corrupted by ſinne. But you may ſay, <hi>What qualification is requiſite, that both private Chriſtians and Miniſters may lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly out in their respective wayes for God? For though</hi> Paul <hi>inſtance here only of his own travails, yet the end of this is general, and belongs not onely to all Miniſters, but all Chriſtians.</hi> We are to do in our way, what <hi>Paul</hi> did in his way: We may in the Apoſtles conſider ſome things as commanded them in their proper perſonal capacity: Some things again as Miniſters which belong to all Officers in the Church: Some things again as commanded them under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believers, and what they do in ſuch a capacity, we all are to imitate them in. It was not the Apoſtles duties only to watch and pray, to take heed their hearts be not overcharged with the cares of this world; to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtreight gate, but it is every believers duty; we have all the ſame end, though not the ſame way. What <hi>Paul</hi> aimed at, by preaching, by travailing from one Countrey to another, the very ſame thing art thou to aim at in thy
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:48709:265"/>
buying and ſelling, in thy trading from one place to another.</p>
               <p>Now amongſt the ſeveral qualifications to inable us thereunto, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to do all things for Gods glory. 1 A converted ſoul.</note>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>A renewed Nature.</hi> We muſt be made <hi>new creatures,</hi> elſe the firſt ſtone is not yet laid in this foundation. <hi>Paul</hi> never was buſie in this ſpiritual merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing for God, till he was converted; while ſome men have their luſts their god; others their god; others the world their god; others honour and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their god: They cannot but toil and moil, go farre and near, only to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie theſe ſpiritual Idols, that they worſhip in their hearts. Oh but when God ſhall make this iron to ſwim, ſhall convert this earth into fire, then he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to improve that firſt Commandment, and to do all things in purſuance thereof, even to <hi>have no other gods, but God alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is required <hi>a publick Affection,</hi> whereby we preferre Gods glory, and the ſpiritual good of others, above all our particular concernments. If <note place="margin">2 A publick ſpirit.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> could even deſire to be an <hi>Anathema</hi> for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſpiritual good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. How much more then would he readily part with riches, honour, and his own eaſe to have procured it? When we read in prophane Hiſtories, and ſee how much ſome of their Worthies have denied their profits, pleaſures and luſts to promote the publick good, we may admire that publick ſpirit God gave them; yet <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerveth truly, <hi>That corrupt aims and ends did prevail in all they did.</hi> How much more then may we behold the glorious work of Gods Spirit upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians, in this very particular of giving them publick affections, that had rather with <hi>Jonah</hi> be caſt into the Sea, then ſee the Church ſink wherein they are? If it be our duty, <hi>To lay down our lives for the brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 16. is it any wonder, if we do the leſſe things for the good of others?</p>
               <p n="3">3. There muſt be <hi>Heavenly mindedneſſe.</hi> Cold doth congregate heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal <note place="margin">3. Heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n indedneſs.</note> things together; the Earth is an heavy element, and falleth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If therefore a man would be active and diligent for God and his Church, he muſt be of an heavenly frame; he muſt be able to ſay with <hi>David, Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and in earth in compariſon of thee? Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. As fire aſſimilateth all things into its ſelf: Thus doth the godly man endeavour that all his relations may be godly, all his friends, all the world if it could be. Hence it is that every godly man, becauſe of this heavenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is in ſome meaſure, though not equal to <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſay, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 28, 29. The care of all the Churches is upon me: who is weake, and I am not weake? Who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> It is ſaid to be a kind of proverbial ſpeech in the primitive times, <hi>If an elect</hi> (that is, a <hi>believer) hath ſinned, his neighbour hath ſinned;</hi> implying the great care Chriſtians took of one anothers ſoul, that if any did ſinne, they were to conſider whether other mens ſins were not made theirs ſome way or other.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Fervency and zeal is a choiſe ingredient in this precious ointment.</hi> If you obſerve who ever did much in their places for God, or his Church; you <note place="margin">4. Fervency and zeal.</note> will find they were alwayes men of zeal. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. you have thoſe duties excellently put together, <hi>Not ſlothfull in buſineſſe, fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Every Sacrifice muſt have this fire, that it may be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to God. It is the ſluggard that hath this field grown over with briars and thornes; want of zeale maketh a man ſtand like an unprofitable tree, that cumbreth the ground. It was <hi>Paul</hi>'s zeal made him do and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo much for the good of the Church. Thus zeal alſo will inflame thee, and make thy heart which naturally is like a cold ſtone within thee, to burn like fire; and then, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh in another caſe, It is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep in thy godlineſſe, as to binde up the winde, or to conceal the ointment thou beareſt about with thee. Zeal will make thee work for God, ſpeak for God. Theſe and the like qualifications will make us put this Doctrine
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:48709:265"/>
into daily practice, <hi>viz. To improve all we are, and all we have for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the good of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Uſe be, To examine our ſelves in this point: Is all we do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God? Doe we live and move to glorifie God? May we not charge our baſe and unworthy hearts with much lazineſſe, much formality; much worldlineſſe, whereby we are hindered from ſpending our ſelves, and being ſpent in his ſervice? Do we not live, as if we had no other buſineſs in this world, then to eat and drinke, to buy and ſell? And yet againe, Who looketh upon himſelf as running in a race, and ſo will not give over till he come to the prize? And truely if wee but conſider the infinite comfort that is in doing of Gods worke, above the worlds, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; this would be a ſharpe goade in our ſides, to make us forward therein.</p>

               <p>WE proceed to a ſecond Obſervation from this relation made by <hi>Paul</hi> of the manner how he intended to performe his promiſe of viſiting of them. For it's plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> by this inſtance doth declare, that he had an univerſal commiſſion to overſee all thoſe Churches in ſeveral places and countreys which he had planted. And therefore in this particular his Office was diſtinct from ordinary Paſtours, which were appointed for particular Cities and Churches, who were to have their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reſidence with them, and ſo were in a peculiar manner to give an account for their ſouls, as their proper charge. God then did not, or doth not require of ordinary Paſtours, that they ſhould like <hi>Paul</hi> travail from countrey to countrey for the propagating of the Goſpel, but in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and faithfull manner to watch over their own flock at home. From whence obſerve, <note place="margin">The office of the Apoſtle and ordinary Paſtors differs, in that the one had an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, the other a particular charge.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Office of an Apoſtle, and an ordinary Paſtor, were among other things diſtinguiſhed in this, that the one had an univerſal charge over all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; the other was limitted to a particular flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>[Among other things]</hi> for there were ſeveral particulars wherein
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:48709:266"/>
Apoſtles and Paſtors are diverſified, as their <hi>immediate call,</hi> their <hi>ocular teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and witneſſe of Chriſt; their power to work miracles; their infallibility in Doctrines:</hi> All which are not now to be looked for in an ordinary Paſtor. Only that which I am to take notice of, is their <hi>illimited and univerſal power,</hi> which the Apoſtles had; they were ſupream Governors in the Church; yet even their Authority was but miniſterial, not magiſterial. Therefore their name declareth they were but as <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> ſent, and ſo were not to do any thing in their own name, but the name of Chriſt who ſent them.</p>
               <p>The opening of this Doctrine may ſerve for information and practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We are to take notice that the Apoſtles had an univerſal commiſſion, to go</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach to all Nations.</note> 
                  <hi>and preach to all Nations, to diſciple them, to plant Churches;</hi> And therefore they were in conſtant travails up and down; for they were the leaven, to leaven the whole world. They were like the Sunne whoſe light and heat have influence upon the whole earth. It is true, they divided their labours, ſome going into one part, and ſome into another, ſo that thereby the word of God prevailed more powerfully, than the Emperours ſword. <hi>Chriſt</hi> indeed ſaith, <hi>He was ſent only to the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt ſheep of Iſrael;</hi> but the Apoſtles were ſent to all the loſt men of the word; and that grace of God which before was incloſed within the borders of <hi>Judea,</hi> was upon Chriſts aſcenſion publickly offered to all Nations. This was that myſtery, which the Apoſtles at firſt perceived not; but when throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, then they began to call nothing, or man unclean. It was then neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for the carrying on of this univerſal and illimited grace of God, to have ſuch Officers, that ſhould alſo be univerſal and illimited; that ſhould go up and down preaching the Goſpel of Chriſt; the goodneſs of God herein mercifully appearing, that no Nation though never ſo barbarous, and in ſuch remote parts of the world, were ſhut out from this glorious light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Office of the Apoſtles, though thus differing from all other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Yet the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Apoſtles did virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all other.</note> 
                  <hi>yet it did virtually and eminently contain all; therefore they could do what the Paſtor and Teacher did.</hi> Hence <hi>Peter</hi> cals himſelf an <hi>Elder,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 1. And <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle (for we take it for granted, it was he that was the Penman of them) in his two laſt Epiſtles ſtyleth himſelf only <hi>Elder</hi> So that the Apoſtles they did preach, they did adminiſter Sacraments; and thus what any other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer did, they alſo could do. Even as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, the vegetative and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſoul, is contained in the rational after a more eminent manner.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Apoſtles therefore had in their Office, that which was ordinary,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had in their office ſomething or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</note> 
                  <hi>and that which was extraordinary.</hi> In their <hi>extraordinary</hi> they had no ſucceſſours; in this particular of univerſal inſpection and over-ſight to Churches, they had none. This Queſtion indeed is greatly diſputed by <hi>Saravia,</hi> and others that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to his opinion, who affirm, <hi>That though the Apoſtles had many extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and perſonal priviledges, yet their Office was perpetual, even as that of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors. There being</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the ſame perpetual grounds for one as well as the other.</hi> But that doth not appear probable. The firſt conſtitution and planting of Churches, requiring that peculiar Office, which planted Churches do not: Even as miracles were then required, but not now; and if any Nation were in theſe later dayes to be converted, there would be required no more an Apoſtle to do this, then miracles to confirm his Doctrine. As it was with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while they were at firſt to be an imbodied people, and before they were fully planted in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> they had extraordinary Officers, and the Lord wrought wonderfull miracles amongſt them, but he did not ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>But the Office of an ordinary Paſtor, is to watch over his flock, to keep conſtant reſidence amongst them.</hi> Even the beſt Popiſh Writers do determine, <hi>That a Paſtors reſidence with his people is</hi> Jure Divino. It is true, there are ſome
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:48709:266"/>
caſes, when they may for a while be abſent from them, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to conſult in Synods and Councils about the publick advantage of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, to ſtop the gangrene of errour, or any prophaneneſs endangering the whole body; but a voluntary abſence from a people is a great ſinne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with all thoſe miniſterial duties that God doth require of them. How can they feed them? How can they admoniſh them? How can they rebuke them, and reprove, as occaſion ſhall ſerve, unleſs preſent with them? That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction <hi>per ſe, vel per alium,</hi> will not hold at the day of judgement. It is not another mans diligence, another mans care that will ſave thee. Now when we ſay, his reſidence is neceſſary, we mean not his meer perſonal and bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence only. For if men be lazy and negligent, their preſence is an abſence. The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>Idol-ſhepherds, ſuch have eyes, and ſee not; ears, and hear not; ſuch have mouths, and ſpeak not.</hi> Now theſe whether abſent or preſent, it's much alike. Therefore this reſidence requireth a faithfull and diligent diſcharge of that weighty work, conſtant preaching, a faithfull diſpenſing of Ordinances: And beſides this publick Miniſtry, as occaſion doth require, a more perſonal and private dealing with their flock, that ſo no man might periſh. We read of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. that he did not deſpiſe a poor ignorant woman, but though weary, and wanting bread, yet attended to her converſion, ſaying, <hi>It was his meat and drink to do his Fathers will.</hi> People are not to interpret ſuch private endeavours of their Miniſters, as too much buſie-medling or affectation of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Yea it is your duty to go unto your Paſtors of your own accord, to enquire about the ſalvation of your ſouls; no man needeth to teach you this, in reſpect of your bodies or eſtates, to go to Phyſicians and Lawyers. Certainly were not theſe things more unto men, than their ſouls, they would have as much recourſe to their Miniſters. Conſider that place, and ſet it upon your hearts, <hi>Mal. 2. 7. The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth, for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> You ſee here our Office, and your duty. Oh then, were men in more holy fear about their ſouls! What if I have not knowledge enough to ſalvation? What if I miſtake godlineſs, thinking it to be that which it is not? What if I delude and flatter my own ſoul? Oh let me go to thoſe that are the wiſe Phyſicians of my ſoul! Let me enquire ſo diligently, ſo exactly, that whatſoever I am deceived in, it may not be in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my ſoul!</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Though a Paſter is thus ordinarily to reſide with his own flocke, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Though a Paſtor is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide amongſt his flock, yet he is a Miniſter of the whole Church of God.</note> 
                  <hi>above all things to attend thereunto, yet he is in ſome ſenſe a Miniſter of the whole Church of God, and ſo is a debtour to the publick good thereof.</hi> We muſt in every Miniſter diſtinguiſh of the habitual and aptitudinal diſpoſition that is in him by his Office, and the actual relation, or exerciſe thereof. It is true, that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is not <hi>primo &amp; per ſe,</hi> made a Miniſter of the Catholick viſible Church, as ſome learned men think; for then his principal and proper duty would be to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the whole flock of Chriſt, and not this or that particular one; yet though he be not <hi>Paſtor Eccleſiae univerſalis,</hi> as the Pope doth arrogantly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to himſelf, yet he is <hi>Paſtor in Eccleſiâ univerſali,</hi> though he be not a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of the univerſal Church,</hi> yet he is a <hi>Paſtor in the univerſal Church.</hi> Hence when he preacheth or adminiſtreth Sacraments in other Churches than his own, he doth it not as a private man, but as a Paſtor in the Church, though not as a Paſtor of that particular Church. The reaſon why a Miniſter may put forth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial acts, though not to his own people, ariſeth from that habitual diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he is put into by his Office. So that to be a Paſtor of a people is not like that predicamental relation <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> which <hi>Logicians</hi> ſpeak of; as if when a people (ſuppoſe) ſhould be all conſumed by the plague ſuddenly, that then a Paſtors office doth wholly ceaſe, not only to them, but to all other Churches; but it's rather under a <hi>tranſcendental relation,</hi> having an aptitudinal reſpect to
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:48709:267"/>
the whole Church of God. But I am not here to dilate on this, it is enough at preſent to know, that a Paſtor is not ſo limitted to his own flock, as if he did not owe much alſo to other Churches; yea he is many wayes to advantage others alſo, by occaſional preaching, by publick aſſiſtance in ſolemn Aſſemblies, by writing and many other wayes. Thus they are to be like ſome full fountains which are able not only to water the proper channel it emptieth it ſelf into, but to overflow ſometimes, as <hi>Jordan</hi> did to the refreſhing of others. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a Miniſter is bound to prefer his own flock firſt, and principally to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them, as his own charge, yet what by prayer, direction and counſel, and what with many other edifying wayes, he is wholly to lay out himſelf for the good of others, and to be as precious ointment which cannot be hidden, but doth refreſh ſtanders by and ſtrangers, as well as thoſe that bear it about; or as muſick doth not only delight thoſe for whom it is purpoſely provided, and who are at the charge of it, but even others that are at a diſtance, or meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>Is it thus then, <hi>that Paſtors are perſonally to attend to their flock?</hi> Then let it be an Uſe of <hi>Exhortation, to you that are the people, readily to ſubmit unto, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them in all their miniſterial labours.</hi> If we are to preach, you are to hear; if we are to reprove, to admoniſh, to inſtruct, then it's your duty to be willing in all theſe things. Why then is it that many are ſo unwilling, ſo froward and oppoſite to the Miniſters of God in their faithfull diſcharge of their Office? Are we from houſe to houſe, from perſon to perſon, as occaſion may require, thus to promote your ſouls good? Why are people ſo averſe to this? They are not willing to be diſquieted, they would be let alone in their ignorance and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thus we take more pains than we have thanks for: They would like us better, if we would meddle leſſe, if every man were left alone to his own ſelf. But though happily you may ſay to other private Paſtors, What have you to do to inſtruct us, to meddle with us, look to your own ſelves? Yet you cannot ſay thus to thoſe whom God hath ſet over you; they muſt admoniſh, reprove, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, whether you love them or not, for ſo doing. So that it argueth horrible negligence in people, when the more lazy, the more careleſs a Miniſtry is, they like it the better; They love no zeal, no diligence, no forwardneſs in ſuch as watch over them. And whereas the <hi>Devil goeth up and down like a rearing Lion, to ſeek whom he may devour;</hi> yet theſe are angry at the ſhepherds of their ſouls, who would deliver them out of his paws. If you were but ſenſible in what thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom you are in to your luſts, how difficult to get any bolts or fetters off from you, as alſo how many oppoſitions are in the way to Heaven; how hardly even a righteous man is ſaved, then you would ſay, all miniſterial labours are too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to provoke thee in this way.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Uſe is of <hi>Admonition to the Miniſters of the Gospel, that they would look upon</hi> Paul <hi>as a ſpecial preſident to follow.</hi> How ought it to quicken us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all dulneſs, lazineſs and weariſomneſs in our work, when we have ſuch an example as <hi>Paul</hi> before us? How often may we bluſh and mourn, to ſee our ſelves fall ſo ſhort of <hi>Paul</hi>'s diligence, zeal and courage in the wayes of God? For though we are not called with him to paſſe from countrey to countrey, from Church to Church, to advance the kingdom of Chriſt, yet within our ſphere we are to imitate him; and as we ſee here in the Text, where there was the leſſe need of his preſence, to continue the leſſe while, as in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> and where there was the greater neceſſity of his pains and labour, to continue the longer while. Thus ought we to diſcern of mens conditions, to conſider who needeth more inſtruction, and more reproof than others, and ſo accordingly to apply our ſelves. Oh how happy is it when prudence and zeal meet both together in the Officers of the Church! This is to be <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> joyned in one perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:48709:267"/>
We come to the laſt particular obſervable in theſe words, and that is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent event, rather than the final cauſe of this his journey unto them, which is <hi>to be brought on his way toward Judea.</hi> You have this alſo mentioned in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 6. as being an expreſſion of love, which he did much regard; and <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. he ſpeaketh of <hi>Timotheus,</hi> that he ſhould conduct him. The original is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>To be lead on forward with respect in his way:</hi> and we have it often inſtanced in <hi>Rom. 15. 24. I truſt to ſee you in my journey, and to be brought on my way by you.</hi> We read alſo of this loving reſpect ſhewed to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> by the Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 3. and eſpecially <hi>Act. 21. 5. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples brought Paul and all his companions on their way with wives and children.</hi> This ſhewed their affectionate love towards them. Yea that is an obſervable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>John</hi> Epiſt. 3. 6. <hi>Whom if thou bring on their journey after a godly ſort, thou ſhalt do well.</hi> In the original it is, <hi>Worthy of God;</hi> thereby implying, that it was more than a meer civil expreſſion, or courteous act of humanity. They did look at God in thoſe eminent ſervants whom they did thus reſpect.</p>
               <p>Now in this expreſſion there are two things implied,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Their cordial affections to them as friends.</hi> This going along with them, did demonſtrate how much they loved their company, that they were unwilling ever to be taken from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It was a matter of honour and respect to their Officers;</hi> it ſhewed they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them more, than of the great and noblemen of the world; yea they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as their own honour, that they had ſuch an Apoſtle. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That where the Miniſtry hath wrought ſpiritually upon a people, it worketh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Where the Miniſtry hath wrought ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, the Miniſter is eſteemed highly.</note> 
                  <hi>great love and honour to thoſe that were the inſtruments thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that the Miniſters of God are to look ſo much at external reverence, and civil reſpect, but chiefly to the heart-affection of a people, and their ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſteem of them. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of this reſpect he had from the <hi>Galatians</hi> upon the firſt work of his Miniſtry upon them, though they did abate afterwards of this love, <hi>Gal. 4. 14. You received me as an Angel of God, yea as Jeſus Chriſt. I bear them record, that if it had been poſſible, they would have plucked out their own eyes, and have given them to Paul.</hi> What hyperbolical expreſſions of love are here ſpoken of? But all this is, where the Miniſtry hath had its ſpiritual effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; otherwiſe you cannot diſcern a man better never to have reaped any good by the preaching of the Goſpel, than that he never knew yet what a converting, a quickning Sermon meant: for if he had, he would never be ſo malicious, ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as he is; he never getteth good by them; and therefore it is no wonder, that he hath no higher thoughts of them. But if through their Miniſtry he hath been converted, he hath been edified in godlines, then how dear and precious are their thoughts of ſuch?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Admonition, Try thy affections to the Miniſtry, by the profit thou reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by it.</hi> Is it any wonder to hear an ignorant perſon, a prophane perſons revile or oppoſe the preachers of the Goſpel? How can it be otherwiſe? They never found any ſoul-ſaving benefit by their pains. Hence the Apoſtle to convince ſuch Chriſtians as were ſtaggering, and beginning to fall off from the truth, and their affections to him, calleth to mind what good they once were made partakers of by his labours, <hi>If ever they were converted, if ever they received the Spirit of God, it was through his miniſtry.</hi> Therefore thrive and profit by their labours, and then deſpiſe them, if thou canſt.</p>

               <p>I ſhall take notice of the firſt at this time; we may conſider how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent the Apoſtle is to free himſelf from all <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> becauſe his enemies would extend this to his Doctrine alſo, as appeareth in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe. He that is not to be truſted (ſay they) in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary promiſes; he that is uncertain and inconſtant there, will alſo be in his preaching and Doctrine; but the Apoſtle doth with all vehemency, yea with a ſolemne oath purge himſelf from this calumny. From whence obſerve,</p>

               </p>
               <p>As it relateth to them, I ſhall (God aſſiſting) treat of it, at the clauſe of the verſe. For the preſent I ſhall handle it in the general, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truth to be made uſe of by <hi>all believers.</hi> And whereas this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:48709:268"/>
may be diſcovered either in our civil and moral converſation, or in our religious and holy concernments.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt. Let us conſider <hi>the ſinfulneſſe of inconſtancy in civil</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in civil reſpects. As 1. When we are not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with our ſelves in our aſſertions.</note> 
                  <hi>respects,</hi> which may be manifeſted in theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When we are not conſiſtent with our ſelves in our aſſertions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations.</hi> This is a great diſhonour to God and our ſelves, when we will ſay and unſay things, affirme one thing at one time, and the contrary at another: And in this caſe <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> is the ſame with <hi>lying.</hi> Thus it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a light vain heart, to talke one thing one time, and another thing another time. Hence the Rule is, <hi>Oportet mendacem eſſe memorem. A liar muſt have a good memory;</hi> and as others ſay, <hi>A liar muſt have a good pair of legs, that he may runne away; for he will quickly be diſcerned, if he ſtay long in one place.</hi> Now we may not wonder, if <hi>Paul</hi> would not be thought guilty of a <hi>lie.</hi> For the way of lying is inconſiſtent with the ſtate of grace, as <hi>Coloſ. 3. 9. Lie not one to another, ſeeing ye put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man.</hi> Obſerve the Apoſtles argument, you that are made <hi>new creatures,</hi> you that have the Image of God repaired in you, how can you lie to one another? Hence you have <hi>David</hi> praying for the grace of God herein, <hi>Pſal. 119. 29. Remove from me the way of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And, <hi>verſ. 163. I hate and abhorre lying, but thy Law do I love.</hi> Mark the oppoſition, no man can love God and his Word, but he muſt abhorre lying. But how little do people generally take heed to themſelves herein? They think not their graceleſſe and unregenerated hearts may be diſcovered by ſuch inconſtant lying words, as well at by groſſe enormities. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look upon it as a very hainous ſinne, not to be a perſon of gravity, conſiſtency and harmony in thy words. Can there be a greater reproach then to ſay of a man, he will ſay and unſay, there is no heed to be given to his words? We are not to believe all things they ſay: if this were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy diſhonour, it were not ſo much matter, but it cometh from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart within. Now the people of God above all perſons are to look to their words in this reſpect, becauſe with <hi>Paul</hi> they have their enemies to obſerve them. And we ſee how prophane perſons are apt to charge them with this, that though they will not ſwear, yet they will lie. This indeed they do, becauſe of their enmity and malice to ſuch as feare God; but be thou ſure to give no occaſion herein for them to blaſpheme. We ſee this holy Apoſtle in a ſolemne, ſacred manner, ſometimes calling God to witneſſe, <hi>That he ſpeaketh the truth, and lieth not,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 31 Gal. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This inconſtancy and mutability in civil respects, is diſcovered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. In our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> 
                  <hi>in our promiſes;</hi> Yea, when it becometh a crimſon ſinne, then it is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in our promiſſory oaths, lightly and perfidiouſly breaking of them. Now as <hi>to abſtain from all lying, and to ſpeak the truth to every man,</hi> is made a property of a godly man: So alſo it is a character of a godly man, <hi>to keep his promiſe,</hi> to be faithfull to that, though it ſhould be to his own damage, <hi>Pſal. 15. 4. He that ſweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.</hi> Though his Word and promiſes prove afterwards prejudicial to him, yet he preferreth truth above all earthly reſpects whatſoever. It is true, Divines have a Rule, <hi>In malis promiſſis reſcinde fidem, A ſinfull promiſe is not to be kept;</hi> for that would be to adde iniquity unto iniquity, and to double thy ſinne. But in things that may be inconvenient to thee, thou art not to uſe lightneſſe, and eaſily break thy word. Thus then it is a character of a godly man to look to his promiſes, to be very carefull to obſerve them: It's unjuſtice to break them, becauſe by a promiſe thou becomeſt a debtor to another. And do you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> ſo carefull, leſt he ſhould be thought to be <hi>yea and nay?</hi> And
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:48709:269"/>
art thou careleſſe about thy word? Oh you muſt know, that true Religion and godlineſs doth not conſiſt in the duties of the firſt Table, but of the ſecond likewiſe. Do not think that this is godlineſſe enough to pray, to perform holy duties, to be often in religious Ordinances: No, but thou art to abound in all truth and faithfulneſſe towards man, to avoid all lying, all falſhood in promiſes, and ſo to have truth both towards God and man. But how apt are our hearts to deceive us in this kind? Some think their righteouſneſs towards man, becauſe their words are as good as oaths, that therefore they ſhall go to Heaven, though they be not forward in religious duties; they have no family-worſhip of God; they do not walk ſingularly to the courſe of the world; and others again, they are ready to think that their religious duties, their forwardneſſe and zeal therein; though they regard not words and promiſes, though they neglect the duties of righteouſneſſe, yet their condition will be good enough. Oh but remember this paſſage of <hi>Paul</hi> for ever, <hi>Be not haſty to promiſe, labour not to forget what thou haſt promiſed,</hi> which will be if thou haſt a conſcientious regard unto thy ſelf herein. For when thou doeſt not think it matter of conſcience, when thou thinkeſt godlineſs is not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein, no wonder then if thou art ſo often found faulty herein. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is very frequent in preſſing theſe duties of truth and righteouſneſs between man and man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>This mutability in civil affairs is ſeen in our affections, our love</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> 
                  <hi>and respect to men.</hi> It is a mans duty to be a faithfull friend to ſuch whom he hath cauſe to reſpect; and therefore of a friend ſuddenly to become an enemy, for one while to love, and another while to hate, this is to be <hi>yea and nay.</hi> Men may be unfaithfull two wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When all the love and respect they profeſſe is in hypocriſie.</hi> Their tongues and their hearts doe no wayes agree. <hi>Joab</hi>'s <hi>Ave,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> his <hi>Salve,</hi> when they intended deſtruction, is famous even to a Proverb. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> often complaineth of ſuch deceitfull men: but then there are unfaithfull men, who once did love, and were real for the time in their reſpects; but then</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Upon carnal ſinfull grounds alter their affections again.</hi> Such perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inconſtant dealings are abominable to God and man. It is one great part of <hi>David</hi>'s complaint that maketh him ſo ſolemnly cry unto God for help, even becavſe <hi>the faithfull fail from among the children of men,</hi> Pſal. 12. 1. It is true, a man of no godlineſs may be a faithfull friend; there are great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch friends amongſt <hi>Heathens;</hi> and the wiſeſt Writers amongſt them, have ſerious Diſcourſes about <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> But godlineſs only doth rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and regulate this faithfull friendſhip. That is a Rule to be abhorred by all men, <hi>Ama tanquam aliquando oſurus;</hi> yet it may have its uſe, conſidering how wicked and uncertain men are: But true Religion inclineth a man to a ſetled and fixed way of love, to thoſe that are fit ſubjects thereof. The Scripture ſpeaketh of <hi>a love to all men,</hi> and of a <hi>brotherly love,</hi> which is upon more peculiar and holy reſpects. Now truly, if we ſpeak in a moral ſenſe onely, we may take up <hi>Solomon</hi>'s complaint, <hi>Prov. 20. 6. Moſt men will proclaim their own goodneſſe; but a faithfull man, who can find?</hi> Men will talk, and boaſt, and profeſſe much love and kindneſſe; but as it was in <hi>David</hi>'s time, ſo it will be in all ages, <hi>Pſal. 5. 9. For there is no faithfulneſſe in their mouth, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part is very wickedneſſe, they flatter with their tongue.</hi> Hence is that Rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But why is there ſuch hypocriſie, diſſimulation and falſhood in mens hearts and tongues? It is becauſe there is ſo little true godlineſs; for that maketh a man ſincere, and of a ſingle heart, both towards God, and towards man. If then <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo afraid of being thought a light and inconſtant man any was; this ſheweth what gravity, conſtancy and faithfulneſs of ſpirit we
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:48709:269"/>
ought to walk even to men in the world, godlineſs and Religion teacheth us theſe things, whereas to be double-hearted, double-tongued, cannot conſiſt with a man that is made a new creature. Labour then to inform thy ſelf of the extent of Religion, how farre godlineſs will put forth its ſelf, not onely in religious duties towards God, but righteous, juſt and faithfull actions towards man. Now that we may have ſuch plain and faithfull ſpirits, conſider the aggravation of this ſinne in our civil actions, to be <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> to be inconſtant and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This is directly contrary to the glorious nature of God, whoſe image</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of this ſinne. 1. 'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of God</note> 
                  <hi>ought to be ſtampt upon us; we are to be like God in our holineſſe.</hi> Now how often doth the Scripture proclaim this glorious property of God, that he is <hi>unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> that he is <hi>faithfull in his Word and promiſes?</hi> And truly this is the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupport of our ſelves, for it's not any worth in us, but Gods faithfulneſs in his promiſes that preſerveth us to eternal glory. Thus he is called a <hi>faithfull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 19. ſo <hi>faithfull is he that hath called us,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 24. If God were not faithfull in his promiſes, even when we have unfaithfull hearts, how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would our end be? It's Gods faithfulneſs, not our own we are to depend upon. Now the children of God they are to have this Image of God eſtabliſhed upon them, to be faithfull as he is faithfull. There is no <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>nay</hi> with God. See this notably affirmed, <hi>Numb. 23. 19. God is not a man that he ſhould lie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent; hath he ſaid, and ſhall not he do it?</hi> So 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 29. The ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie or repent, for he is not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi> The Scripture maketh it a neceſſary property to a man to lie, and to repent, unleſſe he be aſſiſted by grace. For ſuch is the weakneſſe and ignorance of his underſtanding, that he cannot fore-ſee things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt neceſſarily alter his reſolutions; and then ſo corrupt is his heart, that as there are ſeveral objects to entice him, ſo accordingly he transformeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but God is infinitely wiſe and infinitely holy, and therefore there is <hi>no ſhadow of change in him.</hi> Oh then be in love with this glorious Attribute of God, and according to a creatures capacity do thou imitate it! Shew forth the Image of God in this thing, that thou art even a man, and wilt not lie, wilt not ſinfully change thy words and promiſes. I ſay <hi>ſinfully,</hi> becauſe we are ſo apt to be ignorant, to miſ-judge of things, to be deceived in what we reſolve of, that many times it is our wiſdom and duty to be of another mind, and to take up contrary reſolutions, to what once we pitched upon, of which more in its time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Endeavour after ſuch conſtancy in words and life, becauſe as it is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. 'Tis a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to men</note> 
                  <hi>a great ſinne againſt God; ſo it's an heavy reproach and ſcandal to Religion.</hi> It thou ſhouldeſt ſtudy to do the Devil ſervice, and to promote his Kingdom, ſo as to have Religion ſtink in the noſtrils of all men, thou canſt not take a more compendious way then to lie, to deceive, to be unjuſt, to make no conſcience of words and promiſes. This is to betray godlineſs to the ſcorn of all wicked men. You ſee that even the moſt holy men that are, that walk in a moſt tender conſcientious regard to all their words and works, yet cannot ſcape the cenſure of men in the world, that they are <hi>hypocrites,</hi> that they are <hi>lyars,</hi> that they have no truth in them. Oh then what a woe will be pronounced to thee, who ſhould give juſt occaſion for ſuch men to blaſpheme the holy calling, wherewith we are called? When one by his apoſtaſie and inconſtancy had betrayed the true Religion of Chriſt, he was afterwards troubled in heart for it; he could have no reſt in his ſpirit, thought himſelf unworthy of any Church-communion; and therefore cried out, <hi>Calcate me inſipidum ſalem, Trample upon me as unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſalt.</hi> If then thou wouldſt have Religion honoured, the Goſpel well ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; look to thy ſelf in theſe things, let no lie, no falſhood, no deceit be found in thy words and dealings. For if there be, preſently Religion is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:48709:270"/>
then the carnal ones rejoyce; this is their godlineſs, this is their Religion. Certainly a godly heart cannot but bleed exceedingly, if at any time he hath in this way been ſo overtaken, as to make men think the worſe of godlineſs; wherers on the other ſide to be true, righteous and faithfull in all thy wayes, as it is an ornament to Religion; ſo it maketh thee have an awe and a reverence in the conſciences of the moſt profligate perſons. Thus becauſe <hi>John</hi> was a <hi>juſt man,</hi> therefore even <hi>Herod</hi> the King did reverence him, <hi>Mark 6. 20. John</hi> was both juſt and holy, and this wrought reverence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is a great ſinne to be thus raſh and inconſtant, becauſe hereby a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Hereby a man makes himſelf unfit for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> 
                  <hi>man maketh himſelf unfit for Gods ſervice, either in Church or Commonwealth.</hi> ſuch an unfaithfull man can never do any good, but be ſcorned and reproached; as one Biſhop was called <hi>Euripus</hi> in antiquity, for his inconſtancy and mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and this was the great reaſon, why <hi>Paul</hi> doth with ſo much earneſtneſſe and affection take this calumny off from himſelf; for this would be a ſpecial means to bring his perſon and Doctrine into contempt: if there had been juſt cauſe to judge him ſuch a mutable man, <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching would never have done good more; as we hear him ſaying at another time, <hi>Gal. 2. 18. If I build again the things which I deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a tranſgreſſour.</hi> Thus it always falleth out, that a man of mutable and inconſtant principles, he can never be ſerviceable to God; for this debaſeth him before men, this maketh him vile and contemptible, and thereby like a broken veſſel that is of no uſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is a great ſinne to be thus inconſtant in our words, becauſe it's an</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. 'Tis an abuſe of our tongue.</note> 
                  <hi>abuſe of our tongue,</hi> which the Scripture calleth a <hi>mans glory</hi> (though ſome apply it to the ſoul) now for thy glory to be a ſhame, to have thy <hi>tongue</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a <hi>lying tongue,</hi> a <hi>double tongue;</hi> a <hi>falſe tongue;</hi> This is an aggravation of thy wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>As God doth threaten to puniſh lying and deceitfull tongues, ſo he doth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens lying, but encourageth ſincerity.</note> 
                  <hi>graciouſly encourage all ſuch as are of ſincerity in all their words and works.</hi> A lying tongue is one of the <hi>ſeven abominations</hi> which God hateth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 17. as on the other ſide, How mercifully doth God encourage ſome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 8. for he ſaid, <hi>Surely they are my people, children that will not lie,</hi> ſo he was their <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> So that if all theſe particulars be laid together, we may ſee how neceſſary it is to adde righteouſneſs to our Religion, to be as Chriſt, <hi>Whoſe lips were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out guile</hi> in reſpect of God and man. Oh this will afford thee great comfort; this will aſſure thee that thy Religion was not hypocriſie. It's eaſier performing multitude of duties then to walk thus uprightly towards men; they may be done with more eaſe to fleſh and blood, yea they may be the fuell to thy hearts-pride and ſelf-applauſe; but this tendeth really to mortifie ſinne within thee, and to cauſe thee to have reſpect to all Gods commandments.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the ſinfulneſs of Inconſtancy, and lightneſs in matters of Religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 17.</bibl>
                  <q>When I therefore was thus minded, did I uſe lightneſs?</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WE have treated <hi>of lightneſs</hi> and <hi>Inconſtarcy,</hi> as it was expreſſed in <hi>civil things,</hi> whether in our words, Promiſes, or dealings between man and man. This you heard was both a <hi>ſin</hi> towards God, and a <hi>reproach</hi> to religion, yea unrighteouſneſs and falſehood in theſe outward affairs are ſo great ſinnes, that many times they make the greateſt wound in our conſciences; and Experience confirmeth it, That when a man is converted to God, and made ſenſible of ſin, the ſinnes of his unrighteouſneſs doth moſt trouble his conſcience; It is longeſt e're he get the pardon of theſe in his own ſoul: and the Reaſon may be, becauſe ſuch unfaithfulneſs in words and dealings are condemned by the natural light of our conſcience; Even Heathens have been able to judg ſuch things great ſinnes. Now what is done againſt natural light that maketh a greater gaſh in the conſcience. Hence the Omiſſion of thoſe Duties which are meerly known by <hi>ſupernatural light</hi> is not ſo grievous to us, as when an humble broken-hearted ſinner is called upon to <hi>believe in Chriſt, to reſt his ſoul</hi> upon him for juſtification. How hardly is ſuch a contrite ſpirit brought to judge that unbelief herein is a great and heynous ſin; that God is provoked hereby; That, as much as lyeth in us we make Chriſt of none effect: So that, when ſuch a wounded conſcience can complain of its former unrighteous, unjuſt, and ſinfull wayes it once lived in, yet it doth not at the ſame time bewail that great ſin of <hi>unbelief,</hi> its frowardneſs, and ſlaviſhneſs, that it doth not receive Chriſt as a Saviour; yea, it rather judgeth it a duty to keep off from a Promiſe, and to queſtion; whether Chriſt will receive ſuch a wretched ſinner as he feeleth himſelf to be. By which we ſee, what cauſe the people of God have to take heed of ſin in this kinde; for how hardly are they healed! how long may it be ere thy conſcience may be pacified thorough the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But I proceed to a Second kinde of <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> which is of a greater guilt, <note place="margin">Of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things: as in 1. Faith.</note> becauſe expreſt in matters of greater concernment, and relation even to God himſelf. To be <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> off and on, in matters of Religion, this proclaimeth our wretchedneſs. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is <hi>an inconſtancy in our Faith.</hi> When we do lightly and uncertainly receive the truths of God, ſo that we are ready for one Faith one week. and another Faith, another week: This is a very dangerous frame of ſoul, when a man is not of a ſound judgment, neither hath laid a good foundation in Chriſtian Religion, but, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 4. is <hi>like a childe toſſed up and down with every wind of doctrine.</hi> Such are called by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16. <hi>unlearned and unſtable.</hi> In the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:48709:271"/>
number of theſe light and inconſtant perſons, we may reckon the <hi>Galatians,</hi> when he chargeth them with their ſuddain Apoſtacy, <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I marvel that you are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you unto another Goſpel.</hi> They were ready for another Goſpel, for other Teachers, who formerly had received the Apoſtle as an Angel of God, yea, as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This lightneſs alſo was manifeſted in ſome of Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 6. 60, 61. who upon their miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of ſome paſſages in our Saviours Sermon, judging them hard, and abſurd, <hi>from that time went back from him, and walked no more with him.</hi> And truly are not theſe times a ſad inſtance of the lightneſs and uncertainty of many men in the Doctrine of their Faith? In how many mens Religion may you finde Yea and Nay? How many are deſtroying that which once they did build? Now nothing is more contrary to the nature of Faith than this <hi>inconſtancy.</hi> For, if we do conſider what the Nature of <hi>Faith</hi> is, we ſhall finde, that it doth ſo autoritatively bring the underſtanding into obedience of the Divine truth, that it dare not give way to doubtings, and plauſible Objections of deceitfull men any more. The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. giveth us a full deſcription of <hi>Faith,</hi> as to this matter of quieting and ſatisfying the ſoule, for he ſaith, <hi>Its the ſubſtance of things hoped for; and ehe evidence of things not ſeen.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is applyed to a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> that doth even neceſſitate the underſtanding to give aſſent to it, ſo that it hath no power to refuſe it. Thus alſo it is when the ſoul believeth, The ſpirit of God through the word ſo convinceth the heart, that no demonſtration in Sciences nor objects to ſenſe can be more potent to perſwade. Oh then take heed of Inconſtancy in Principles of Faith. This will argue thou art built upon a ſandy foundation, that thou doſt believe ſuch Doctrines onely upon humane Motives, and deceitful grounds. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle doth exhort to a full perſwaſion of minde, even in thoſe points that were more controverſal, and diſputeable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. How much more then are we to be perſwaded fully in our minde concerning thoſe truths that are fundamental, and do ſo immediately concern our Salvation? This uncertainty then, this Yea and Nay, in matters of Faith ariſeth from a meer humane faith, whereby we are carried out to believe theſe things, upon no better grounds, than the <hi>Turk</hi> doth his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> Education, cuſtome, and Univerſality. This is the whole reaſon of our Faith; whereas a Divine Faith is wrought by the Spirit of God, as the efficient; it is that which lifteth up the heart to receive the Word as Gods word. Though Men have never ſuch parts and underſtanding in the ſenſe of the Scripture, yet they cannot believe it, unleſs inabled thereunto by the Spirit of God. And again, Divine Faith hath alſo a divine Motive, the Authority and Teſtimony of God revealed in the Scripture, ſo that we believe not becauſe man ſaith ſo, but becauſe it is the Lord that ſpeaketh. Thus the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> chap. 2, 13. are commended, that they <hi>received the Word, not as the word of men, but as it was indeed, the word of God.</hi> Now then, when a mans Faith is wrought by Gods Spirit, and eſtabliſhed upon Divine Autority, then it becomes more immoveable than the Heaven, and Earth, for, as God is alwayes the ſame, his word is alwayes the ſame, ſo is Divine Faith. This then all are to labour for, is even a full perſwaſion in their own minde, about the truths of Religion, to take heed of <hi>inconſtancy</hi> and <hi>inſtability</hi> herein. We ſee the Martyrs could not by any terrible menaces, or fair Promiſes, be drawn of from the truths of God they had embraced; and was it not becauſe they had a powerfull

But yet how frequently doth it fall out ſo: what is this but to mock God, and dally with our ſoules? In times of afflictions, or under quick convictions of Conſcience, to be then afraid of ſin; then to bewail ſin, then to reſolve againſt ſin: but when this fear is over, then to imbrace our <hi>Dalilah</hi> again. There are few ſinners but they come under this crime of <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> in this reſpect; for many do not alwayes continue in an obſtinate, ſenſleſs way; they finde ſome thawings, and meltings of heart, with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and therefore cry out, that God is righteous, and they are ſinners; and they reſolve to let their Luſts go, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the people of Iſrael; but they quickly change their Reſolutions again. Such therefore as finde theſe Yeas and Nays, theſe ebbings and flowings, let them ſeriouſly conſider, what an high provocation this <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> is, of God againſt their ſoules. This unſteadfaſtneſs was often complained of by the Prophets, in the people of Iſrael; They were as ſo many Graſhoppers, that leap up on high from the ground, but then ſettle on it preſently again. In their afflictions they cryed out of their Idols, they called upon God; but then proved like a deceitfull bow: and is not this an Epidemical ſin? What is more ordinary than to be ſoul-ſick, to be conſcience-ſmitten under ſome Sermons, or ſome ſad afflictions, and fears, but in all theſe things to have <hi>Reubens</hi> Curſe upon their ſoules, <hi>unſtable like water,</hi> upon which you make any impreſſion, but it receiveth none? Its one of <hi>Solomons</hi> wonderfull things, that leave no footſteps to be obſerved, <hi>A ſhip in the Sea, none can tell which way it paſſed.</hi> Thus it is with many, they ſin, and they repent; and they repent, and ſin; inſomuch, that when you ſee them overcome with their old luſts, and paſſions, would you think they were ever the men, that prayed ſo, that reſolved ſo? you cannot ſee the leaſt footſteps of any ſuch Repentance. Now, that all may be afraid of ſuch lightneſs, <note place="margin">Motives againſt this Inconſtancy. 1. There is the ſame Reaſon at all times againſt ſin.</note> and uncertainty, it is good to conſider theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>If there be reaſon at any time for thee to look upon thy ſinnes, as bitter and terrible, the ſame will hold at all times.</hi> Oh the time hath been, when in thy thoughts ſuch ſinnes thou haſt committed were intolerable, the memory of them was as gall and wormewood. Thou didſt cry out, take them away, or that the Lord would pardon them. Now do but conſider, Is there not the ſame reaſon ſtill to think ſo? Is ſin grown any better? Is it leſs damning? Is it leſs ſinfull to God then it was formerly? Know then, ſin is not altered, that is, hath as terrible guilt as ever; but thou art changed; thoſe convictions, thoſe powerfull Operations of the Spirit of God are not happily now upon thee; they are witdrawn, and thou art left to thy own natural corrupt ſelf. Remember then thy ſelf, ſaying, <hi>The time was, no ſerpent or toad was more odious to me than my ſinnes: the time was, when night and day they were a burden and torment to me; but now they grieve me not, they trouble me not; ſin is not changed, but I am changed.</hi>

<pb n="518" facs="tcp:48709:272"/>
will bite like an adder, and ſting like a ſerpent: they hear them ſay, that the evil of ſin is far greater than the evil of any puniſhment and torment; but they think them words only; they never had any experience or taſte of any ſech bitterneſs: But it is otherwiſe with thee; thou haſt had wounds in thy heart, the terrors of God have fallen upon thee. The Law hath appeared in its accuſing and condemning power; therefore thou art the more inexcuſable who wilt run into this fire, when thou haſt been burnt with it; yea, with this taſte, there hath been practical light, and experimental knowleg; and therefore thy ſin is the greater: a general knowledg of any thing is but confuſed and weak in reſpect of a practical and experimental one. Hence wicked men are ſaid <hi>not to know God,</hi> becauſe they have onely a general knowledg, they do not practically improve this, ſo as to love God, to fear him, and obey him. If then thou haſt been in the pains and torments of ſin, and yet wilt venture on the committing of it, who will pitty thee? If a man ſhould be brought out of Hell torments, to live here upon earth, and yet would commit ſin again, would any have compaſſion on ſuch a man, if afterwards he ſhould be damned. Thus it is with that man, who hath the beginnings of Hell already upon him: its Gods mercy that he giveth thee ſuch a taſte of Hell in thy conſcience, that thou mayſt fly from ſin: But if, for all this, thou wilt be worſe than a fool, that no experience will teach thee, then how juſt is it with God to deliver thee up irrecoverably unto Eternal wrath?</p>

I have been but an Hypocrite, and diſſembler with them; my Repentance was a lye, my Tears were a lye; for I am the ſame man again that I was. The Scripture indeed maketh <hi>every man a lyar;</hi> but to be a lyar in thy Repentance, a lyar in thy ſorrow for ſin, This is the moſt abominable and deteſtable of all. Take heed then of having <hi>an heart and a heart,</hi> as the Scripture calleth it, in theſe things: An <hi>heart</hi> to cry out of ſin, and an <hi>heart</hi> to receive and imbrace it again.</p>

Thus the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had ſo often dealt unfaithfully with God, in a ſeeming manner, repenting, but afterwards turning back to their luſts again, were at laſt delivered up <hi>to blinde eyes, to deaf ears, to hard hearts, never to underſtand and to be converted,</hi> as we have it <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. As Aguiſh Fits holding very long, at laſt end in a Conſumption: Thus thou who haſt often had troubles, and workings of heart about ſin; yet falling often into them again, may become forſaken for ever, as <hi>Saul</hi> was; the Lord never meeting thee more in any Ordinance.</p>

from the ſinnes we were addicted unto, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cryed out, Take away this judgment, this once: Thus we ſay, if God will try me once more, then what a Reformed man will I be? But if God ſpare thee, then how quickly are ſuch holy Purpoſes forgotten? Now you are to know, this is a great aggravation of thy ſin to promiſe thus to God, to purpoſe thus before God, and then to deal falſly. Yet what ſlight and formal thoughts have people concerning ſuch Promiſes? But one day thou wilt finde the heynouſneſs of thy falſe heart herein. A ſecond time, when we are to make Promiſes to God, is at <hi>the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?</hi> where the conſciences of men are ſo far awed, that they engage themſelves to God, and renew their Covenant with him, to walk with more care and fear than ever before. But how much Yea and Nay is therein many Communicants? Who would think thou ſhouldeſt be ſo careleſs and negligent man, after ſuch ſolemn Stipulations made with God? Oh how little are theſe Promiſes thought of, that we frequently make to God? And if it be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Satan</hi> is ſaid <hi>to fill his heart,</hi> to make him do ſo. To how many may we ſay, alter ſuch Promiſes made to God, but broken, <hi>why hath Satan filled thy heart to lye unto God?</hi> It is <hi>Solomons</hi> Advice concerning Vowes and Promiſes made to God, <hi>That we ſhould not be haſty and raſh in ſuch things,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 2. with this Reaſon, <hi>For God is in heaven, and thou in earth.</hi> He is an Inſuate glorious God; and thou a poor worm upon the earth. Surely this negligence in people generally to fullfill their Promiſes made to God ſhould be more ſeriouſly bewailed than it is. Your Baptiſmy, The Lords Supper, they are Covenants made with God; there is a renewed Promiſe made to God in Sacramental Adminiſtrations, that we will be the Lords, that we will not live to the world, or ſin, but to God alone. Now, take heed of perfidiouſneſs in this particular. Thou takeſt Gods Name in vain, in this caſe; and he will not hold ſuch guiltleſs: Yea, there is never a Prayer that we pray unto God, but there is implicitely a Promiſe made to God, that if he will grant our Requeſts, we will gloryfie his name by an holy and godly life. Take heed then of being judged out of thy own mouth: God, at that Day of Judgment, will bring thy own words, thy own Promiſes againſt thee.

               <p>IN theſe words the Apoſtle doth remove the Second ſinfull Cauſe from himſelf that uſeth to make men change their purpoſes, and that is, A reſpect to <hi>carnal Conſiderations.</hi> Men that look only to their Profits, to their Greatneſs and Honor, ſuch muſt needs be <hi>mutable</hi> and <hi>inconſtant,</hi> like the <hi>Camelion,</hi> turning into the colour of every object they come nigh; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attributeth to <hi>fear</hi> in that creature, if there be any ſuch thing. And thus when men purpoſe and deſign, but fear of loſing ſome carnal Advantages their hearts are ſet upon, cauſeth them to be Yea and Nay, to reſolve, and then to unreſolve; to promiſe, and then to break promiſes. For, as in Speculatives, Concluſions are according to the nature of Principles from when they flow; ſo, in all Practicalls, our Actions are coloured according to the Ends we propound to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the corrupt Principle, which <hi>Paul</hi> doth here diſavow, is, <hi>To purpoſe things according to the fleſh;</hi>

This is ſpoken oppoſitely to the willing of things according to the Principles of Godlineſs revealed in the Word; or, as in other places to <hi>the Spirit;</hi> for, <hi>to walk in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>to walk in the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. are made immediately oppoſite to one another. <note place="margin">Of the Phraſe according to the fleſh, which is taken for 1.

               </p>
               <p>Now this Phraſe, <hi>According to the fleſh,</hi> hath a Threefold ſignification in Scripture:</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſignifyeth <hi>That which is done according to the meer humane nature without any corruption.</hi> Thus Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 1. 3. to be born of the ſeed of David, according to the fleſh.</hi> That Oppoſition doth evidently demonſtrate againſt <hi>Socinians,</hi> that there is another nature in him, which is, his Godhead, ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. he is ſaid <hi>to be put to death in the fleſh.</hi>

                  <hi>them.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 16. We know no man after the fleſh,</hi> no not Chriſt himſelf: That is, We do not attend to any External or ſenſible Conſiderations that may be had from Chriſt; but our hearts are wholly carryed out in a way of believing on him, even as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luke 8. 21. My Mother, and my brethren, are they which hear the word of God, and do it.</hi> Thus ſome are ſaid <hi>to glory,</hi> and <hi>to have confidence in the fleſh,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> renounceth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4. and that was in the Priviledges of the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So that any external thing in Religion, though it be vouchſafed as a Priviledg by God, yet it is but <hi>fleſh,</hi> in reſpect of the gracious works of Gods Spirit. Thus there is a Jew and Circumciſion <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> and a Jew and Circumciſion <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> which is good to be obſerved; for of too

Oh, ſay rather, Let mony periſh than my ſoul periſh; let wealth and profit go, rather than peace and quietneſs of a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>A Second Principle of the fleſh, which maketh men inconſtant, is <hi>An</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Ambition.</note> 
                  <hi>inordinate deſire of Greatneſs and Honour above others.</hi> They that walk by this, muſt be black and white; now ſay, and than deny, according as thoſe are affected from whom they exſpect Advancement. This ſecret Ambition is accompanyed with a vehement heat, and drought of the ſoul, making a man reſtleſs, till their deſires be accompliſhed. Neither may we think the Heathens onely to be blamed for theſe proud affectations. We ſee even the <hi>Apostles</hi> twice contending about Primacy and Superiority; which is the greater wonder, if we conſider the meanneſs of their own condition they were in, as alſo of Chriſt their Maſter; and yet, more wonder it is, if we remember how frequently our Saviour did inform them of Perſecutions, and ſaddeſt Calamities for his ſake. We read likewiſe of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> 3 John 9. <hi>who loved to have the preheminence,</hi> and would not own, no not the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> himſelf. Now, thoſe that walk by ſuch Principles <hi>of pride</hi> and <hi>ambition,</hi> they muſt needs be like a <hi>materia prima,</hi> ready to receive any form. They flatter, they diſſemble; they commend, they diſpraiſe; and thus debaſed they are, that afterwards they may be exalted. Now nothing is more odious and abominable to a ſincere man, than ſuch mutability and uncertainty. Hence <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of old were called the <hi>juſt and holdfaſt men.</hi> It was not thus with <hi>John Baptist,</hi> of whom, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>What went ye out to ſee? a read ſhaken with the winde.</hi> No, he did faithfully and conſtantly diſcharge his duty, without any fear of men; But how many may we go out to ſee, <hi>as reeds ſhaken with every winde?</hi> And as the reed muſt grow in ſome mire, ſo muſt ſuch mutable perſons have ſome carnal reſpect to encourage them. Thoſe that climbe up to high places are apt to have their heads grow giddy, and to be unſteadfaſt; ſo that, when men lay this as a foundation, I will have Preferment, I will have Honor and greatneſs; though it damn me; this man walketh upon ſlippery ice, and no wonder if he often fall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another carnal Principle, which maketh <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> in all our wayes, <note place="margin">3. Pleaſing of men.</note> is, <hi>Pleaſing of men.</hi> When a man maketh this his Rule he muſt change often, and be as a ſhadow, which moveth whoily according to the motion of the body, ſtoopeth when that ſtoopeth, and is upright when that is upright. The Apoſtle doth notably diſclaim ſuch a ſinfull diſtemper, ſaying, <hi>Galat. 1. 10. If I ſhould pleaſe men, I could not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> Man is a mutable creature, ſubject to different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, to different affections, loving one thing one day, and hating it at another. Then muſt they alſo, who would pleaſe men, be prepared for
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:48709:274"/>
all formes and poſtures: inſomuch, that a man cannot live in greater bondage and ſlavery, tan to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a peoples ape;</hi> or to ſtudy the humouring of thoſe we have to deal with. If thou art guilty of this <hi>man-pleaſing,</hi> thou art never able to do thy duty; thou canſt not reprove and puniſh ſin; thou canſt not be juſt and righteous in thy place. Our Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>How can you belive, which receive glory of one another?</hi> John 5. 44. <hi>and do not ſeek the glory of God only?</hi> Certainly, till we ſtudy to pleaſe God alone in our lives, and aim at his glory, who is alwayes the ſame, we muſt be unſtable as water, and be a lyar to every man. We read of ſome who did believe in Chriſt, yet dared not to make Profeſſion thereof, for fear of the Jews: Here was a deſire to <hi>pleaſe men</hi> rather than God. But can the good word, and favour of men deliver thee from the wrath of God in thy conſcience? and eternal torments hereafter? When <hi>Judas</hi> pleaſed the Chief Prieſts, in betraying of Chriſt; could they comfort him in the Agonies of his conſcience? yea, when he bewailed his ſin: They ſay, <hi>What is that to us? look thou to that,</hi> Mat. 17. 4. Such miſerable tormentors inſtead of comforters will all thoſe men be, whom thou haſt pleaſed, to diſpleaſe God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Time-ſerving</hi> is a Principle, which whoſoever walketh by, muſt be as <note place="margin">4. Time-ſerving.</note> a weather-Cock that is turned with every winde. The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are remarkeable for this <hi>Inconſtancy</hi> under wicked and Idolatrous Kings: then they erected Altars, they adorned Images: and then immediately under Religious and Reforming Kings they would deſtroy the Idolls, and deface the Images they had ſet up. It is true, all change and alteration in Religion is not to be blamed, yea, ſometimes it is to be encouraged. When <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancton</hi> gave over their former corrupt Doctrines, and ſuperſtitious Practices, the Papiſts condemned them for Turn-coats, and Apoſtate perſons; when yet this change was neceſſary. So that, as they ſay in Philoſophy, there is <hi>alteratio corruptiva</hi> and <hi>perfectiva;</hi> a <hi>deſtructive change,</hi> and <hi>a perfective</hi> change: thus it is alſo in Divinity, and the Latter is abſolutely commanded by God, when Errors or Prophaneneſs have, like a gangrene, ſpread over the whole Church: but of that in its time. We are now ſpeaking of that ſinfull change whereby people accommodate themſelves to the times they live in, and therefore judg of truth, judg of the holy things of God, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, with ſubordination to State-Intereſts. This is the great carnal Policy that the Wiſe-men of the world admire; as if the true Doctrines of Chriſt were not alwayes the ſame: as if a thing might be the worſhip of God one time, and Idolatry at another: as if the ſame thing might be the Doctrine of Chriſt at one time, and Hereſie at another: as if that of <hi>Cuſanus</hi> were true, though otherwiſe not a very bad man, That the Scripture is to be underſtood according to the preſent ſtate and Affairs of the Church; and therefore, ſaith he, <hi>We are not to wonder, if at one time ſome Cuſtomes and Uſages be exacted in a Church, which, at another time are to be decryed and refuſed.</hi> But certainly the Scripture is a Rule of Faith and Manners in all Ages, in all Changes and Revolutions. Though Kingdomes and States may alter, yet the Scriptures are the ſame ſtill, and what was once the Doctrine, Worſhip, and Order of Chriſt, is ſtill the ſame.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That all Particulars may be comprehended in one, To live according <note place="margin">5. Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing.</note> to the Principles of the Fleſh, is <hi>To ſet up our ſelves as the Alpha and Omega;</hi> to enjoy our ſelves, and to uſe all things, yea God himſelf, in ſubordination thereunto. Thus this love of a mans ſelf, even to the hatred of God, is that which maketh us put on multiform ſhapes; it is that which maketh us bend and bow, and comply in all things. For, if we did love the Honour and glory of God, more than our own ſelves, as we ought to do, then we ſhould not
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:48709:275"/>
attend to ſelf-advantages, but Gods glory and honor: So that we may ſay, This Self-love is the <hi>Beelzebub</hi> ſin; it is like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine, that devoureth all it meeteth with. Why doth a man purſue this thing one time, and then oppoſe it again? Why doth he build, and then deſtroy it again? It is only for <hi>Self.</hi> No wonder then, if our Saviour laying down a fundamental Qualification in his Diſciples, requireth, that a man ſhould <hi>deny himſelf, Mat.</hi> 16. 24. and truly, he that cannot <hi>deny himſelf,</hi> he will certainly deny God, and Chriſt; he will deny the true Faith of Chriſt, when he is plunged into extream temptations. Self-denyal then is that which will make a man deſervedly be called <hi>homo quadratus,</hi> better than he in <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> for he is ſettled upon ſuch a ſure and immoveable Rock, that he will abide the ſame under all ſtormes and tempeſts.</p>
               <p>In the next place we are to ſhew, What are thoſe <hi>Principles and rules of grace</hi> we ought to walk by, oppoſite to thoſe of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that ſome may alwayes be ſteadfaſt, and immoveable in the work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But for the preſent, we may by Uſe of Inſtruction be informed what to exſpect from any carnal man; he will never be faithfull to God, and man, he will change and alter according to earthly reſpects: and therefore every ſuch man is a lyar, both towards God, and man. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did once, by way of ſtratagem, make as if he were turned <hi>Arrian,</hi> and publiſhed, That all who would not <hi>Arrianize</hi> ſhould loſe their Preferment, and be deprived of his favour. Hereupon their were very many began to change their Religion, many did deny the Deity of Chriſt. But when he had diſcovered them enough, then thoſe few who would not deny the truth, and imbrace <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> though it was to their great loſs, he imbraced and incouraged; and, as for the other Apoſtates he threw them off, ſaying, That they, who were not faithfull to God, would never be ſo to him. Now, from all natural men, who walk by no Scripture-Principles, but the luſts of their own hearts; you cannot exſpect any better: they never followed Chriſt, but for the loaves, and therefore, when they fail, they will alſo withdraw. Theſe are like the Mill, that goeth no longer than the waters drive it. No wonder then, if godly wen finde them to love to day, and to hate to morrow; for they do thus even to God himſelf. Take heed then of purpoſing the things of thy ſoul <hi>after the fleſh;</hi> for then all thoſe preſent affections will preſently dye, and wither within thee. Thou wilt not long hold in the ſame minde, but we ſhall quickly ſee it changed, and thee falling off. Therefore, as <hi>David</hi> prayed, when he ſaw the people offer willingly, 1 Chron. 29. 18. <hi>O Lord God keep this for ever in the hearts of thy people.</hi> So we may pray for thee, when at any times manifeſting ſome deſires, ſome affections, to what is good, <hi>O Lord keep this for ever in their hearts.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Principles in general, and a godly mans in particular.</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 17.</bibl>
                  <q>Or the things that I purpoſe, do I purpoſe according to the fleſh?</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HItherto we have been diſcovering <hi>what principles of fleſh there are,</hi> which natural men do walk by, whereby they are made ſo mutable and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. We are now to ſhew the godly mans <hi>principles,</hi> who purpoſeth things according to the Spirit, and thereby he is alwayes the ſame, becauſe God and the Scripture is alwayes the ſame; yea hereby as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, it may be ſaid of him as of God (though with infinite diſproportion) <hi>I am God, and change not:</hi> So the godly man having the Image of God ſtampt upon him, he is godly, and he changeth not. But before we come to ſpecifie the <hi>principles</hi> of the godly who purpoſe after the Spirit, let us take notice of ſomething in the general, relating both to the ſpiritual and carnal man: As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Herein are men differenced from bruit beaſts, that they are carried forth to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of Principles. 1 Herein men differ from bruit beaſts, becauſe they act from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, beaſts by inſtinct.</note> 
                  <hi>operations by ſome principles within them, where as the bruits are acted by a natural inſtinct.</hi> The Schoolmen make a Queſtion, <hi>Whether the bruit beaſts do worke for ſome end, or no?</hi> And they conclude negatively, becauſe they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or underſtanding; yet by God, the firſt cauſe, they are <hi>acted</hi> to an end, which they do not underſtand: according to that Rule, <hi>Opera naturae, ſunt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra intelligentiae.</hi> But now man he being a rational creature, as he hath ſome end to which he referreth all his actions; ſo he hath ſeveral principles guiding of him to that end. Theſe principles are like the wings to the Bird, the oars to the ſhip; legs to a man to bring him to his end. So that principles having ſuch powerfull influence into what a man doth; it behoveth a man above all to look to them, to have ſanctified and ſpiritual principles, to conſult, chooſe, and act by.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Theſe principles whereby all men do walke, are either ſpeculative, or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Principles are either ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative or practical.</note> 
                  <hi>practical, ſuch as regard truth, to be imbraced, or good to be practiſed.</hi> Indeed there are in all men ſome general and common principles; but of thoſe we ſpeak not. There are ſuperadded to theſe, acquired principles, or infuſed; and theſe are more proxim and particular than the former. It is a general remote princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>That good is to be imbraced, evil to be avoided.</hi> But (alas) come to the practical improvement of this, and then you would think the clean contrary were true, <hi>that evil only was to be loved, and good to be eſchewed;</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe the corrupt heart of man acquireth practical ſinfull princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <note place="margin">3. All the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men are ſinfull and carnal.</note> to walk by. So that untill God infuſe heavenly principles, he doth no more incline to, and delight in good, than ſwine can in pleaſant flowers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Such is the univerſal corruption of man by nature, till regenerated,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:48709:276"/>
that all the principles he walketh by are ſinfull, carnal, and earthly.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>That there is none underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, none ſeeketh after God, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> And is it any wonder? For can men of corrupt principles do holy actions? Every man is as his principles are; they make him a good tree, or a bad tree. As a man is affected, ſo he judgeth, ſo he loveth, ſo he hateth, ſo he liveth and worketh in all things. Hence with the Schoolmen, we have often this aſſertion, <hi>That what principles are to concluſions, the ſame is the end in things to be done.</hi> And therefore as from falſe principles a man can never gather true concluſions; ſo neither from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt end is a man ever able to perform a good action. They have alſo another Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, <hi>That what the forme is in natural things giving being unto them, the ſame is the end in moral things, and that humane actions are ſpecified from the end.</hi> They are gold or droſſe, as the end intended is; all which ſhew the neceſſity of a mans attending to <hi>his principles;</hi> what they are that move him and carry his ſoul out to work. For it is not ſo much a mans actions and wayes, as his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples therein that do denominate him; and ſeeing they are either the Spirit or the fleſh; every one either walketh in the fleſh or the Spirit; let a man faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſearch into his own boſome, and obſerve what hath the predominant effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; what he may call his <hi>principles</hi> he purpoſeth, and liveth by: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, <hi>Theſe principles, though efficacious, yet are manytimes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Principles are oft hidden</note> 
                  <hi>and hidden.</hi> It is a Rule, <hi>Principia ſunt maxima virtute, minima quantita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te.</hi> Therefore being thus ſecret and inward, it is not eaſily found out, what principles we walk by. Do thoſe that walk after the fleſh, know they do ſo? Do they believe ſo? Do they complain of ſuch a rotten and ſandy foundation? No they rather applaud themſelves: even the moſt carnal men that are, do judge their principles good and right; they have a good heart, and good ends. No doubt when <hi>Paul</hi> perſecuted the Church, oppoſed ſo zealouſly the way of Chriſt, though in all this he was acted by <hi>fleſhly principles,</hi> yet he thought them Religion and ſervice of God. It is therefore our duty to examine, and ſearch into every corner of our hearts, to find out the bottome of thy ſoul. For thou art never able to judge of thy condition, whether good or evil, till thy <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> are made manifeſt in thee. How often mayeſt thou flatter thy ſelf, as doing things for God and his glory, when it is thy own corrupt ſelf, thy own glory, thy own advantage?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Theſe principles of the fleſh, are not onely in our external dealings</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. There are principles of fleſh even in our holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> 
                  <hi>with men, or in groſſe bodily ſins, but in religious duties, and our ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</hi> Oh conſider this diligently! A man may pray after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> hear after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> preach after the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and that is, when a <hi>fleſhly</hi> motive putteth us upon ſpiritual duties. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> when they prayed, they did walk <hi>according to the fleſh;</hi> and thoſe who adored Angels, and introduced volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary worſhip, theſe had a <hi>fleſhly mind,</hi> Col. 2. 18. Men are in the fleſh, and walk in the fleſh, not onely in reſpect of groſſe ſinnes, and bodily iniquities, but even when in ſpiritual duties they are led by ſinfull motives. Thus <hi>Jehu,</hi> when he purpoſed the deſtruction of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and his family, the overthrow of <hi>Baal</hi> and his worſhip, he did all this after the <hi>fleſh.</hi> When <hi>Judas</hi> reſolved to follow Chriſt, to be his Diſciple; all this was a <hi>reſolving according to the fleſh.</hi> Now this we ſhould hear with trembling, and an holy fear; my religion may be <hi>fleſh,</hi> my holy duties <hi>fleſh,</hi> my profeſſion of godlineſſe, nothing but <hi>fleſh.</hi> For though the duties themſelves are good, and commanded by God, yet the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from which they flow, may be the <hi>fleſh</hi> in thee. Do not take therefore all holy performances to come from a principle of ſanctification in thee. Did hypocrites and temporary believers diligently conſider this, it would be a ſpecial means to prevent their final deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="527" facs="tcp:48709:276"/>
Laſtly, <hi>The principles of the carnal, and the ſpiritual are directly contrary to one another, even as light and darkneſſe; and therefore one can never agree</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the carnal, and of the ſpiritual are contrary.</note> 
                  <hi>with the other.</hi> Prov. 29. 27. <hi>An unjuſt man is an abomination to the juſt; and he that is upright in his way, is an abomination to the wicked.</hi> Every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man cannot but abominate the way of the wicked; and then the wicked abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth the way of the godly, ſo that there can never be any agreement. Now both ſtrive for their <hi>principles,</hi> diſpute for their <hi>principles.</hi> The godly man ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his, and would bring men off to them. The wicked man is as reſolute for his <hi>principles,</hi> and is active to have them take place. And from hence is that enmity between the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent. Now it's a godly mans duty to keep cloſe to his <hi>principles,</hi> not for a moment to depart from them; This is to betray God and his conſcience. But the wicked man he is bound to leave his, to come out of them with all haſte, for they will be his damnation at laſt.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us conſider, <hi>What are the principles of a godly man, by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a godly man.</note> 
                  <hi>which he thinketh, purpoſeth and liveth.</hi> So that if at any time he deviateth from this, his heart is ſmitten, his ſoul melteth, ſaying, This is not according to my principles, I have not thought, ſaid, or done like my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now there are two general <hi>principles</hi> of a godly man, whereby he is kept <note place="margin">There are two general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. 1. There is a principle of knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> the holy Scriptures.</note> from purpoſing or living according to the fleſh. The one I may call <hi>Principium cognoſcendi:</hi> The other <hi>Principium eſſendi,</hi> or rather <hi>efficiendi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, which is <hi>the principle of knowledge,</hi> by which we are to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our ſelves in faith and manners, that is the holy Scriptures, which are a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſufficient and adequate Rule to live by, how contemptuouſly ſoever the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> on the other, do ſpeak of it. We ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15, 16. directing <hi>Timothy,</hi> though ſo eminent in the Church of God to the Scriptures, not to the immediate inſpirations, but unto them which he had known from his youth, giving admirable commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them from the efficient cauſe, they were by the inſpiration of God, who would not regard what God himſelf ſaith? That will prove true, and every thing contrary to it a lie: and then the adjunct property, <hi>holy;</hi> they are <hi>holy Scriptures;</hi> By theſe alone thou wilt be enabled to have an holy nature, and to live an holy life. As thoſe that keep in Apothecaries ſhops, ſmell of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: thus thoſe who exerciſe themſelves in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> they become <hi>holy,</hi> they are conformed thereunto. Such a man is like a tree by the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, bringing forth his fruit in due ſeaſon. Again, they are commended from their <hi>end,</hi> which is to <hi>make us wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> This is the deſirable and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end of all men to be ſaved. But we are ignorant of the way, how to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; we miſtake the paths that lead thereunto; and therefore the Scripture only giveth us wiſdome herein. Furthermore, they are commended from a four-fold effect, <hi>For Doctrine, correction, reproof and inſtruction in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> with the conſequent thereof, <hi>That the man of God</hi> (even <hi>Timothy,</hi> and ſuch who are in holy Offices of the Church) <hi>may be throughly furniſhed for every good work.</hi> By this we ſee, what is the Rule a godly man walketh by, it is the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> he believeth according to them, he worſhippeth according to them, he liveth according to them. Oh the holineſſe and admirable lovelineſſe that is in his life, who thus walketh according to Scripture! Oh remember that you have no other Rule to walk by in reference to heavenly things! Thy Religion muſt be a Scripture-religion, thy faith a Scripture-faith, thy repentance a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-repentance, thy godlineſſe a Scripture-godlineſſe; elſe at the day of judgement, thou wilt have that ſentence upon thee, which was an hand-writing in the wall againſt that great King, <hi>Thou art numbered and weighed in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and art found too light and wanting.</hi> But oh the horrible neglect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in! who mattereth what the Scripture ſaith? Who ordereth his life according
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:48709:277"/>
to that Canon? What art thou a drunkard by Scripture, a ſwearer by Scripture? Know aſſuredly, that he which learneth not holineſſe from the Scripture, ſhall never find comfort from the Scripture; that hath precepts as well as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and without obedience to one, we cannot reap any comfort from the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The other principle of a godly mans, but efficiently, is the Spirit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit of God.</note> 
                  <hi>of God enlightning and ſanctifying by the Scripture.</hi> The Word is the Rule, the Spirit of God is the efficient cauſe; The Scripture is like Chriſts garment, the Spirit is the virtue and power of God communicated to the ſoul thereby. Hence are thoſe deſcriptions of a godly man, that he is <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> that he <hi>liveth in the Spirit, walketh in the Spirit, is led by the Spirit;</hi> which muſt not be wreſted to any immediate Revelations, and <hi>Enthuſiaſtical motions,</hi> and thereby oppoſed to the Word, but the Word is ſubordinate to the <hi>Spirit.</hi> This is the pool, wherein the Spirit of God deſcends and vouchſafeth healing to the ſoul therewith. Now <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> maketh this a great part of <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, he did not <hi>purpoſe according to the fleſh;</hi> that is, he could not diſpoſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his journeyes to come and go whither he deſired, becauſe he was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the command of the Spirit, to be directed thereby. For we read, when <hi>Paul</hi> had a mind to preach the Goſpel in ſome places, he was hindered by the Spirit, and ſo could not go; but thoſe directions of the Spirit and Revelations, were extraordinary, and for that preſent age of the Church, and are not now to be expected: The Spirit doth now enlighten, ſanctifie, direct and guide us by Scripture-rules. And hereupon it is, that the godly are ſaid to <hi>be led by the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>to walk by the Spirit;</hi> and this ſhould provoke the godly to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Oh is pride from the Spirit of God? Is worldlineſs, is envy, is paſſion from the Spirit of God? Remember alwayes from what Spirit it is, that thou doeſt things. The Apoſtles thought it a good zeal, when they would have fire from Heaven to come and deſtroy the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Luk. 9. 55. but Chriſt rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, ſaying, <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of.</hi> Take heed then thy own Spirit, or a deluding ſpirit be not the principle that moveth thee inſtead of Gods good Spirit. Thus you ſee the two general Rules, that we ſhould order our lives by; the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Spirit:</hi> whatſoever is not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe is not ſuitable to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe general principles, we may inſtance in ſome particulars, that a <note place="margin">Particular principles. 1. Alwayes to keep a good conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man.</note> godly man doth walk by, and againſt which he dare not ſinne. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To keep a good conſcience towards God and man. Paul</hi> profeſſed <hi>he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed himſelf herein</hi> (Act. 24. 16.) <hi>towards God,</hi> therefore he taketh heed of any thing that may make his heart ſmite him; he had rather have his peace of conſcience than all the advantages in the world. Hence in all things his Queſtion is, Will not this trouble my conſcience? Will not this diſturb the peace of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? This is a bleſſed principle he keepeth cloſe unto. And then again, in reſpect of man, he keepeth an inoffenſive conſcience, he lieth not, he defraudeth not, he injureth not, he looketh to righteouſneſs as well as Religion; his principle is to be holy towards God, and juſt towards man; and in following this principle, he aboundeth with joy in his heart, he liveth chearfully and fruitfully, and withall doth awe the hearts of the moſt deſperate enemies to the wayes of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another principle is, <hi>To make ſure of his ultimate end for which God made</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. To make ſure of his ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate end, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means to it.</note> 
                  <hi>him, and the neceſſary means conducing therunto.</hi> His <hi>end</hi> is glory and ſalvation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The <hi>neceſſary means</hi> therunto is grace and godlines here, while we are in this world; ſo that while other men walk according to their ſeveral <hi>principles,</hi> ſome will be rich, ſome will have their honours, others their profits; his <hi>principle</hi> is to be godly here, and ſaved hereafter. Hence he giveth all diligence to theſe two things. So that if you ask him, Why are you ſollicitous? Why are you ſo carefull? Why ſo often in praying, ſo often in hearing? It is (he ſaith) to obtain grace here
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:48709:277"/>
and glory hereafter. This I muſt have, I dare not live and die without it: for want of this principle, men have ſuch ſluggiſh and dull affections to heavenly things.</p>
               <p>A third principle is, <hi>To live and walk with daily expectations of death, and the day</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Daily to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect death and judgment.</note> 
                  <hi>of judgment,</hi> as if he heard alwayes that voice ſounding in his ears, <hi>Ariſe, and come to judgement.</hi> He deſireth to have ſuch thoughts of ſinne, as a man dying, as a man arraigned at Gods tribunal would then have. Death is certain, nothing can exempt him from it; and therefore he deſireth to die daily, to be preparing for theſe great changes. <hi>In morte ſolâ non eſt fortaſſis,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved, In all things in the world there is a <hi>fortaſſe, a may be.</hi> Thou mayeſt be a rich, thou mayeſt be a great man, but we cannot ſay, <hi>It may be thou mayeſt die, it may be the time will come, when thou ſhalt fall into the grave.</hi> No this is without all doubt: hence the godly mans principle is ſo <hi>to live, that death and the day of judgement may be no new thing, or terrible dreadfull thing to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth principle is, <hi>To judge ſinne the onely, or the greateſt evil, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. To judg ſin the greateſt evil, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs the greateſt good.</note> 
                  <hi>the greateſt good.</hi> If this were a principle in mens hearts to live by, what reformed perſons ſhould we ſee every where? This principle in thy heart would be like fire there; if ſinne be thought worſe than any evil, then poverty, ſhame, miſery, yea and hell it ſelf, better be any thing than a ſinner. How couldſt thou give thy ſelf up a ſervant thereunto? Though it were a pleaſing ſinne, a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinne, yet becauſe it is a <hi>damning ſinne,</hi> thou wouldſt runne from it, thou wouldſt ſay, Oh this ſinne, though I love it, though I am uſed to it, yet it can never be good for me, it will be the poiſon of my ſoul! And then on the other ſide, a godly mans principle is, <hi>That godlineſſe is more worth than all the great and glorious things of the world.</hi> His ſoul longeth for it more than ſilver and gold; he thinketh every rich man, every great man, a miſerable man, if he be not godly. As <hi>Rachel</hi> cried, <hi>Give me children, elſe I die;</hi> ſo give me godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Lord, elſe I am damned. As <hi>Abraham</hi> did not ſo much rejoyce in his wealth and outward mercies, becauſe he was ſtill <hi>childleſſe;</hi> ſo ſaith this man, It is not earthly comforts Lord, but grace that refreſheth my heart, let me be poor, contemned, rather than not godly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Exhortation,</hi> To examine what are the principles you walk by. There are but theſe two, and they are contrary one to the other, the <hi>principle of the fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>principle of the Spirit;</hi> and ſuch as your principles are, ſuch are ye. If thy <hi>principle</hi> be to be godly, to live by the Word, to ſave thy ſoul, then thou art daily in theſe things: thy heart is there, thy life is there. But if it be fleſh that ruleth in thee, then this maketh thee like a worm and a moal alwayes in the earth. You cannot repent, you cannot believe, you cannot be ſaved, while theſe <hi>principles</hi> abide in you; for they make you prejudiced againſt godlineſſe, they make you neglect repentance. Oh but when thou ſhalt lie howling and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in hell, how wilt thou curſe and bewail ſuch principles? Theſe have damned me, theſe have brought me to this place of torment, I would not entertain other principles.</p>

                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 17.</bibl>
                  <q>That with me there ſhould be yea, yea, and nay, nay?</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IN theſe words is the ſinne ſpecified, that would flow from thoſe two evil cauſes named before, <hi>viz. Inconſtancy,</hi> and <hi>corrupt principles.</hi> They that are led aſide by theſe, muſt needs be liars, and perfidious perſons, frothy and vain, to whom no credit is to be given. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth here remove the ſinne of lying, or ſaying one thing, and doing another thing; for ſuch an unfaithfull, falſe man, can never be ſerviceable unto God: by that uneven carriage of his, he maketh himſelf uncapable of bringing glory to God, and of edifying others.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Greek expreſſion, and the interpretation of it, there is great diverſity amongſt the learned: That which troubleth moſt, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of thoſe particulars, <hi>yea, yea, nay, nay.</hi> For we read it as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and a duty, <hi>Matth. 5. 37. James 5. 12. That our communication ought to be yea, yea, nay, nay;</hi> whereas the Apoſtle doth here ſpeak of it as a ſinne. Some therefore do think that the gemination of the particle crept into the Text by the errour of the Scribes, who finding it uſed in other places, thought it ſhould be here alſo; and they are the rather induced to this, becauſe in the verſe following, the Apoſtle doth not uſe the gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, onely affirming, <hi>Yea and nay.</hi> Others they think that the Greek particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is a note of negation, ſhould be ſupplied, making it to runne negatively, as if with me were not <hi>yea, yea, and nay, nay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is no neceſſity of running unto theſe harſh remedies, for we may keep the gemination of the particles well enough, as intending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a vehement affirmation, and a vehement negation. For ſo the <hi>Hebrews</hi> uſe to affirm vehemently, by doubling the word; And our Saviour often uſeth <hi>Amen, Amen;</hi> which cuſtome alſo <hi>Heinſius</hi> ſaith is among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Greek Authours. And thus the ſenſe will be very coherent, <hi>I doe not inconſtantly and carnally purpoſe things; as if I ſhould with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency affirme one thing at one time, and then with as great a vehemency deny it again at another time.</hi> But then we muſt acknowledge, that this differeth from thoſe places above-mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and <hi>James</hi> 5. for there the latter <hi>Yea,</hi> and latter <hi>Nay,</hi> is the predicate in the Prepoſition; here it is the ſubject, and <hi>Nay, nay</hi> the predicate. In thoſe places alſo there is a reſpect had to our ſpeech, as oppoſite unto oaths; but here is denoted only truth and conſtancy in our affirmations. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth not read the words interrogatively, and thereupon hath a peculiar interpretation, implying the clean contrary to what we have ſaid: For he maketh the meaning to be, as if <hi>Paul</hi> did deny he was conſtant, or ought to be unchangeable; he was not to have <hi>Yea, yea, nay, nay,</hi> but to be <hi>yea and nay,</hi> as occaſion ſerved,
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:48709:278"/>
becauſe he was not at his own diſpoſing, to go whither he would, but was wholly guided by the Spirit of God; and therefore when he attempted to preach in ſome places, the Spirit of God ſuffered him not. So that with this Authour, <hi>Paul</hi>'s intention ſhould be to remove from himſelf ſuch a conſtancy, as if he were to diſpoſe of himſelf, and to hold to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, whereas he was wholly to follow the guide and motions of Gods Spirit. But this ſeemeth not ſo proper. The Apoſtle rather defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the charge of lying and unfaithfull dealing; he was not <hi>Yea and nay.</hi> Hence ſome make the Latine word <hi>Naucus,</hi> that ſignifieth a vain, empty, trifling fellow, to come from the Greek words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but of this more in the following verſe. Seeing then that <hi>Paul</hi> doth in this expreſſion free himſelf from the crime of <hi>lying,</hi> and ſaying one thing, but doing the contrary, We may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That lying, or contrariety between our words and words, or words and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lying is not conſiſtent with godlineſs</note> 
                  <hi>actions, are not beſeeming a Chriſtian, neither are they conſiſtent with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A godly man can be no more godly and a liar, than godly and a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, than godly and a prophane perſon. This ſinne the Apoſtle maketh as a ſtream to flow from thoſe two poiſoned fountains of levity of mind, and a corrupt carnal heart. Now how inconſiſtent this is with the new man, and the work of grace, you have heard from <hi>Coloſ. 3. 9, Lie not one to another, ſeeing you have put off the old man with his deeds.</hi> To be <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> is to be a lyar; and ſometimes, as the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth here, we may be very vehement and earneſt in our <hi>yea's</hi> and <hi>nayes,</hi> and then we are bold vehement lyars. I ſhall not enlarge my ſelf concerning the whole Theological matter, that may be delivered about a lie, but ſpeak ſo much as will be for our practical improvement of this truth. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, We are to take notice of this, <hi>That there may be a lie</hi> materiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and</hi> formaliter. That is a <hi>material lie,</hi> when we ſpeak that which is <note place="margin">1. There is a material and a formal lie.</note> untruth; but yet we think it to be a truth, or elſe we would not ſpeake it. But then that is <hi>formally a lie,</hi> when we affirm that to be true, which we know to be falſe; and this is directly and properly a lie. Some ſay, the former is <hi>Mendacium dicere;</hi> the other is <hi>Mentiri.</hi> Now this latter way of ſpeaking untruths, is that which properly is called a <hi>lie;</hi> and men do then formally <hi>lie,</hi> when they ſpeak that which their conſciences doe tell them to be falſe; yet in ſome caſes, when we ſpeake thoſe things that are untrue, though we thinke them to be ſo, we are not preſently excuſed from ſinne. For in many things, it behoveth us to have knowledge, and a right information, before we ſpeak about them. Hence the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are often called <hi>lyars,</hi> who it may be thought they ſpake what was true, being delivered up by the juſt judgement of God to <hi>believe a lie:</hi> and therefore we muſt take heed of raſhneſſe and ſuddenneſſe in our words, that we may alwayes ſpeak that which is conſonant to the truth, both <hi>materially</hi> as well as <hi>formally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We may diſtinguiſh of lies, as they doe of oaths, There are Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertory</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. There are aſſertory and promiſſory lies.</note> 
                  <hi>lies, whereby we affirme things to be ſo and ſo; There are alſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory lyes, whereby we doe promiſe to doe ſuch and ſuch things, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards breake theſe engagements.</hi> And the Apoſtles ſpeech may relate to both theſe kinds of lies, and both theſe are ſinnes againſt the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; either when we affirme any thing falſly, or perfidiouſly breake our promiſes. For ſeeing words are inſtituted to ſignifie our ſenſe and minde to others, if we abuſe them to other ends, we doe hereby deſtroy the end
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:48709:279"/>
of ſpeech, and ſo as much as lieth in us overthrow all humane commerce and ſociety. But in a <hi>Promiſſory lye,</hi> there is a further aggravation of the ſinne, becauſe hereby the rules of juſtice are broken; for by promiſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man cometh to have a right to the thing promiſed. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this Text, had a right to <hi>Paul</hi>'s preſence, when he had promiſed them. Now where grace is in a man, that doth ſo ſanctifie him, that he taketh heed of every way of lying, whether in words or promiſes. It is true, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaketh of this verity as a moral vertue: And there are ſome, who have (as it were) a natural juſtice, their words are as good as oaths, their promiſes are as good as bonds and bils. Some <hi>Heathens</hi> have been famous for ſuch a truth in their converſation; but yet godlineſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man keep from lying and falſhood upon other grounds, then ſuch natural juſt men; which is good to be obſerved. becauſe many are ſo apt to build the comfort of their ſouls upon it. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such natural true men, they are ſo onely from the <hi>Principles of a natural conſcience, not from the principles of ſanctification within them.</hi> If you ask them, Why they doe it, or obſerve the ground, you ſhall ſee it is onely becauſe the light of Nature inſtructeth them herein. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be commendable, yet it is not enough to make it godlineſſe in them; for what is done in a godly manner, ariſeth from a <hi>principle of godlineſſe,</hi> which is the new nature within a man. So that it is one thing to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre lying from a meer natural conſcience; and another thing to do ſo from a <hi>ſupernatural light</hi> within them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You may obſerve a difference in the motive, <hi>The godly man dareth not lie, becauſe God forbiddeth, becauſe it's a ſinne that he abominateth;</hi> whereas the <hi>natural true man, never minds the Scripture; it is not from the word of God that he doth it, but becauſe it is a laudable thing amongst men.</hi> They will greatly praiſe ſuch a man, that is ſo conſtant; It's the glory of men they look at, not the command of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſuch men are true and juſt, but not from a godly principle, is plaine, <hi>Becauſe they doe not receive all other holy duties.</hi> The ſame God that hath commanded thee not to lie, not to deal falſely, hath alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee not to be drunk; he hath commanded thee to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to keep up Family-duties, to love thoſe that are godly, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſuch: whereas many times none are more bitter enemies to the power of godlineſſe, and the beauties of holineſſe, then ſuch natural, juſt and true men. Oh therefore that ſuch would not ſtay in that! Thou doeſt well that thy words are ſure, that thy ſpeeches and actions are juſt; but doe not ſtay here, doe not thinke thou haſt enough for Heaven. For though you doe all theſe, yet if you delight not in godlineſſe, if you love not thoſe that are holy men, if you cannot abide this ſtrictneſſe and preciſeneſſe in religious duties, know that thou art but half a Chriſtian yet, there are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Table, as well as the ſecond, and how greatly mayeſt thou charge thy ſoul with ſuch ſins, didſt thou not put thy truſt and hope in thy true and juſt dealings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Divines do uſually ſpeak of a three-fold kind of <hi>lying, There is a pernicious lie, a ſporting lie, and an officious lie.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. There is a pernicious, ſporting and officious lie.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A pernicious lie</hi> is, when we ſpeak that which is falſe to the hurt and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſporting lie</hi> is, when we do in merriment affirm things that are falſe, only to pleaſe and delight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An <hi>officious lie,</hi> or <hi>mendacium miſericors,</hi> as ſome call it, <hi>a mercifull lie,</hi> is when we tell a lie, but it is for the good of another, to ſave him out of danger or death: ſuch was <hi>Rahab</hi>'s lie, and the lie of the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives.</hi>
                  <pb n="533" facs="tcp:48709:279"/>
For though God rewarded them for the maine, yet it doth not follow he allowed their lie, but pardoned it. It is diſputed by ſome, Whether this be a ſinne, or no? And <hi>Luther</hi> is ſo farre from making it a ſinne, that he ſpeaketh of it as a duty <hi>(in Geneſ.)</hi> And <hi>Muſculus</hi> alſo alloweth of it. Yea <hi>(Comment. in Johan. cap.</hi> 8.) he hath this ſtrange di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, <hi>Mendaciorum quaedam fuit licita &amp; bona, quaedam excuſabilia, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam levia, quaedam vitioſa, quaedam diabolica.</hi> But certainly, though <hi>ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>officious lies,</hi> are not ſo great ſinnes as <hi>pernicious,</hi> yet they are all intrinſecally evil, and ſo cannot be made good for any advantage of the world. To <hi>lie</hi> that thou mayeſt deliver a man from death, is not lawfull, becauſe of the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>We muſt not doe evil, that good may come thereof,</hi> Rom. 3. 8. Even as adultery and fornication may not be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under any pretence whatſoever, no not by a woman, to ſave the life of her husband; of which caſe ſome ſpeak of: So it is alſo with a lie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſinne intrinſecally, and of its own nature, and therefore can never be made good. Hence it is, that it is forbidden without any limitation to this <hi>lie,</hi> rather than another, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 11. even as ſtealing and dealing falſly are. Therefore <hi>Caſſianus</hi> is of opinion, That it is lawfull to uſe a <hi>lie,</hi> as we doe <hi>Hellebore,</hi> to depell ſome grievous danger, and that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs for this end, did ſometimes uſe <hi>lies,</hi> is wholly to be exploded. <hi>Plato</hi> was firſt the authour of this opinion, That Magiſtrates might uſe, <hi>Mendacio, ut medicamento,</hi> from whom <hi>Origen</hi> and his followers were infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this point. But as we heard, every <hi>lie,</hi> is of its own nature a ſinne, becauſe as the Schoolmen ſay, It's <hi>Actus cadens ſupra indebitam mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam.</hi> For words are naturally the ſigne of our meaning, and to uſe them otherwiſe is unnatural. And this ſhould make us be the more wary in our ordinary ſporting diſcourſes. For how few do attend to this ſinfulneſſe of the tongue herein. But if of every idle word, a man ſhall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then much more of every lying word, though it may ſeem no ſuch great matter to us. It is certaine, the Martyrs thought no ſuch <hi>lies</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, no though thereby they might have eſcaped cruel torments. Yea, they are blotted with ignominy in Antiquity, who either by favour or money would accept of a Certificate or Teſtimonial, that they had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed at the Altar, when indeed they had not, and thereby preſerving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But what gain is this to ſave a temporal life, and looſe a ſpiritual life?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whereas ſinnes according to Divines are diſtributed into <hi>ſinnes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Lying is a ſinne of the tongue.</note> 
                  <hi>of the heart, of the tongue, and of the hand;</hi> Cordis, oris &amp; operis, <hi>Lying is a ſinne of the tongue.</hi> So that as by the tongue we come to know the diſeaſe ſometimes of the body that is within; ſo by the tongue we may diſcerne a ſinfull, wicked heart. A lying tongue doth argue a deceitfull heart. So that as the pureneſs and foulneſs in the fountain doth quickly empty it ſelf into the ſtreams: Thus as the heart is either holily or ſinfully affected, ſo it emptieth it ſelf into the tongue and hands.</p>
               <p>Hence in the fifth place, <hi>All thoſe who would abſtaine from the way of lying, muſt ſtudy the ſpiritual government of the tongue.</hi> Nature indeed <note place="margin">5. They that would not lie muſt ſtudy the government of the tongue.</note> hath incloſed it with lips and teeth; but Grace muſt have a more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and predominant curb over it. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth notably ſpeak of the ſinfulneſſe of the tongue, <hi>James</hi> 3. 6. calling the <hi>tongue, though a little member, yet a world of iniquity, an unruly evil, full of deadly poiſon.</hi> Certainly, the Apoſtles zeal diſcovered in that Chapter againſt a <hi>ſinfull tongue,</hi> ſhould make us with much diligence watch againſt it, eſpecially in that it is ſo unru y, that no man can tame it. Now among many ſinfull evils of the tongue, this of <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>falſhood</hi> is not the leaſt. So that he

who hath an holy, meek, juſt and faithfull tongue, is called by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle a <hi>perfect man,</hi> verſ. 2. not but that he hath ſtill much imperfection in him; onely we are ſo apt to ſinne by that, to offend by that. What is in the heart, is ſo quickly in that, that the Chriſtian hath arrived at a great proficiency in godlineſſe, who hath this power over his tongue, Hence <hi>David,</hi> as ſenſible of this work above his own ſtrength, maketh his earneſt addreſſe in prayer unto God, <hi>Pſal. 141. 3. Set a watch (O Lord) before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips.</hi> Grace muſt be the ſpiritual porter to watch the mouth, elſe ſuch ſins will come out thereat, that will both greatly offend God and man.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſixth place, <hi>That this government of the tongue againſt lying or any other ſin may be attained unto;</hi> it is neceſſary, <note place="margin">He that would govern his tongue, muſt firſt cleanſe his heart.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To cleanſe the heart,</hi> that is the original and ſource of all evil; and therefore it is in vain to heal the outwards, unleſſe the inwards alſo be firſt purged. Therefore <hi>David</hi> in the fore-mentioned prayer, addeth another Petition to the former, <hi>Pſal. 141. 4. Incline not my heart to any evil thing.</hi> Therefore when <hi>Solomon</hi> had firſt given that counſel, <hi>Chap. 4. 23. To keep the heart with all diligence,</hi> then he ſpeaketh of the duties about the eyes, hands and feet. No man can in an holy manner keep his <hi>tongue</hi> from ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, curſing and ſwearing, with other ſinnes thereof, unleſſe he firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that the inward frame of the heart be made pure and holy. <hi>The old man muſt be put off, and the new man put on,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, and then we lay aſide the <hi>way of lying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Let us conſider, what are the cauſes of lying, of yea, and nay.</hi> I doe not mean the general ones, for the Text nameth them to <note place="margin">The cauſes of lies.</note> be <hi>inconſtancy</hi> and <hi>a corrupt heart,</hi> but the particular ones. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some have <hi>a ſtrong inclination and peculiar propenſity to it; they love</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</note> 
                  <hi>and delight in telling of lies.</hi> Yea this lying diſpoſition is noted to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of ſome Countreys; as the Poet ſaid of the <hi>Cretians, They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes liars,</hi> Titus 1. 12. which witneſſe the Apoſtle ſaith, is <hi>true.</hi> And no wonder at this, for the ſame Apoſtle maketh it the quality of every man by nature, and that wherein he doth oppoſe God, whoſe Attribute is truth, <hi>God is true, and every man a lyar,</hi> Rom. 3. 4. Seeing then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is thus prone to it; and ſome have a more peculiar inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it; no wonder if lyes as well as oaths do make a Land mourn. Do we not ſee it in children, how they are more forward to lie than to ſpeak? They come both together, only lying ſeemeth more natural.</p>
               <p>A ſecond cauſe of <hi>lying, is want of dependance upon God,</hi> as if he would not fulfill his promiſes without our lies, and unlawfull means that we <note place="margin">2. Want of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God.</note> uſe. In this <hi>Rebecca</hi> failed, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 27. 6, 7. though ſhe knew of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s affections were ſet upon <hi>Eſau</hi> the elder brother, ſhe ſaw no viſible way how the promiſe ſhould be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore ſhe uſed lying and diſſimulation; but though ſhe got the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for her ſonne, yet many ſad afflictions did befall both her and <hi>Jacob</hi> thereby.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another cauſe is, <hi>The captivity and bondage that we are in by nature to</hi>

move our tongues. And truly the name of a lie is a very reproachfull thing: How hardly can men endure the name of it, who yet are conſtant in the practice of it? So that the reproach, eſpecially the cauſe from whence it cometh, may perſwade us to leave it off, which is hell it ſelf, we ſhall then quickly hear every man ſpeaking truth with his neighbour.</p>

What if thou gaine the world here, and loſe thy ſoule hereafter? Will not this be a dreadfull and diſmall lie to thee? Remember that place, <hi>Prov. 12. 19. The lying tongue is but for a moment.</hi> Hence <hi>Prov. 13. 5.

               <p>IN this Verſe the Apoſtle giveth a reaſon why he did not uſe <hi>Lightneſs,</hi> or purpoſe things <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> viz. Becauſe the word he preached was not ſo much his word, as that which came from God, the Supream truth: and therefore as no Falſhood could fall on God, ſo neither upon his Word that floweth from him. Some indeed underſtand the Word <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaketh of, of his Promiſe to come to them; as if he did thus ſolemny affirm, That he was not unfaithfull in his Promiſe. But the enſuing words do evidently declare, That he meaneth his Preaching: that his Doctrine was not mutable and changeable; For the malevolent Adverſaries that he had to do with, they took occaſion from the altering of his purpoſes, or at leaſt deferring of his Promiſe in that Particular, about coming to them, to charge his whole Doctrine with the ſame levity and inconſtancy; to bring all he Preached into Queſtion, becauſe of that. Whereupon the Apoſtle being far more ſolicitous, for his Doctrine, and his Office, then his own credit, or glory, doth eſpecially fortifie that, and confirm the Truth of that: ſo that, by this we ſee the nature of evil men; Whatſoever failings or weakneſſes may be in a Miniſter, they preſently charge his doctrine with it, and blame his Miniſtry; whereas Gods truth is truth, and thou art to receive it, though the Miniſter may be falſe, and unworthy: but of this wore in its time.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles Argument in this Text, to confirm the truth of the Doctrine he preached, is from the truth of God, the meaſure and Rule of all truth: if his word be <hi>a lye,</hi> then God muſt be ſaid to <hi>lye,</hi> which is heynous blaſphemy to ſpeak <hi>but God is true.</hi> This Expreſſion is taken by ſome to be only Enunciative, and Affirmative, barely aſſerting the truth of God; as if the meaning were, <hi>God is true, from whom we have received our commiſſion to preach the Goſpel, and therefore that alſo muſt be true.</hi> Others, (and they ſpeak more probably) take it to be an <hi>oath,</hi> that the Apoſtle doth here uſe a <hi>ſacred oath,</hi> for the confirming of what he ſaith; and ſo it is the ſame with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> form of an <hi>oath, The Lord liveth:</hi> and <hi>Heinſius</hi> maketh thoſe expreſſions, <gap reason="foreign">

God hath many glorious Attributes: There is his Omniſcience, his <note place="margin">God is true</note> Omnipotency, his Juſtice, and his Mercy: and there is alſo his property of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is of great uſe and Influence in our comeforts and Duties. This <hi>truth of God</hi> is often celebrated in the Scripture: Yea, he is not onely ſaid to be <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>truth</hi> itſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4. he is ſo eſſentially, <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf, that the Word ſaith, <hi>It is impoſſible for him to lye,</hi> Heb. 6. 18. For, he being <hi>truth</hi> in the abſtract, no falſhood or lye is compatible with him. Abſtractives admit of no mixture, though Concretives may: Light in it ſelf, or whiteneſs in it ſelf admitteth not of any darkneſs: but as it is in ſubjects, ſo it doth. Now God, as he is ſaid to be <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>that there is no darkneſs in him at all,</hi> 1 John 1. 5. So God is truth, and in him there is no falſhood at all. But let us diſcover this Doctrine in particulars. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a twofold Truth. <hi>A Metaphyſical Truth, and a Morall, or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. There is a Metaphyſical and a moral Truth.</note> 
                  <hi>Ethicall truth. A Metaphyſical truth</hi> is the <hi>truth</hi> of Being, and Entity; and thus the Scripture doth often celebrate the <hi>truth</hi> of God, making him only to be the <hi>Jehovah:</hi> He is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Am that I am.</hi> For if that rule be true, <hi>Ens &amp; verum convertuntur,</hi> then, where is the chiefeſt and Infinite Entity? there is alſo the Supreameſt Verity. This true being of God is often oppoſed unto Idols, and the Heathens Gods, which have no true being at all. And that God is true in this ſenſe is the very fundamental Article of all Religion, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. He that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is.</hi> This truth of Gods being is often to be remembred againſt that Atheiſme which doth reign in moſt mens hearts. How could they live in ſuch exceſs of riot, did they believe there was a God? But ſecondly, there is a <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>Ethical</hi> Truth, and that is Two-fold, either <hi>Verity</hi> or <hi>Veracity. Verity,</hi> is when we ſpeak, or barely affirm that which is true. <hi>Veracity,</hi> is in our Promiſes, when we faithfully perform them: Now this Twofold <hi>truth</hi> is eminently in God: There is the truth of his aſſertion, and that is revealed in his Word, which is alſo called <hi>truth:</hi> So that, whatſoever is affirmed there, can no more deceive us than God himſelf. And then there is the <hi>truth</hi> of his Promiſes, and the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Threatnings: the <hi>truth</hi> alſo of Propheſies, and Predictions, in all which God will be found <hi>true.</hi> When <hi>every man is a Lyar, God is true</hi> then in what he ſaith, in what is foretold, in what he promiſeth, and in what he threateneth. Never let the prophane and ſecure ſinner flatter himſelf, hoping it will prove otherwiſe than the Word ſpeaketh. There is no threatening of God will prove a lye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's a Diviſion <hi>of truth; into truth increated, and created. Increated</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. There is an increated, and created truth.</note> 
                  <hi>truth</hi> is God himſelf; and he is called <hi>truth,</hi> becauſe Gods underſtanding is the meaſure and rule of all other Truths. Nothing in the world is <hi>true,</hi> but as it is conſonant to his knowledg. It is otherwiſe with us: Our underſtanding is not the meaſure of the truth of things, but there truth is the meaſure and rule of our underſtandings: then is our knowledg true, when it is conformable to the thing it ſelf; but then is the thing true, when it is conformeable to the knowledg of God. So that, herein is the Infiniteneſs and excellency of <hi>Truth,</hi> as it is in God manifeſted, above that which is in man: So that, man may well, reſpectively to God, be called a <hi>lyar, There is no truth in him.</hi> Now, becauſe truth, as it is in God, is inviſible, and the ſame with his Eſſence, and we are never able to cown to know Truth but by God: Hence we have the Scriptures given to the Church, as the <hi>rule of truth.</hi> All truth is from God, whether it be natural or ſupernatural. When any of the Heathens have found out Truth, it was from God, even as all faſhood is from the Devil: ſo that, when the Godly do lye, 'tis from the Devils temptation, the <hi>Father of lyes.</hi> Thus when wicked and ungodly men have uttered truth, it hath been of God. Now
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:48709:282"/>
becauſe Supernatural <hi>truth</hi> could not be diſcerned but by Divine Revelation, and pacefaction. Hence it pleaſed God to make known in his Word, What is that <hi>truth</hi> which will lead us to Salvation: So that, ſeing we are not able to behold truth, as it is in God, we muſt look upon it as it is in his Word; for God is the hidden Truth, as it were; the Word is the revealed truth: Therefore whatſoever is Scripture, we may conclude of it as ſure and firm Truth, coming from the ſupream truth. If then, ye ask, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did another way, <hi>What is truth?</hi> I anſwer thee, <hi>The Scripture is truth.</hi> No men are true, any further than guided by Scripture, and led by the Spirit of God accordingly. Oh that therefore you did more aw your hearts with the truth of Gods Word! If that ſay, ſin will be bitter in the latter end, though it may bring profit and pleaſure for a while, believe it againſt all the wicked men in the world, and ſay, I do more believe this Text, this Place of Scripture, than all which the wickedneſs of men may oppoſe againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that God is true, <hi>Herein he differeth from man; and is thereby oppoſite</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In that God is true, he differeth from men and devils</note> 
                  <hi>to the Prince of darkneſs.</hi> He differeth from <hi>man:</hi> Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Numb. 23. 19. God is not as man, that he ſhould lye or Repent.</hi> To truſt in man, is to lean upon reads. Yea, hence it is, that becauſe God only is Truth, no paſtors or Officers in the Church are to be believed any further than they bring the Word of God: It was Chriſt alone, God and man, that could ſay, <hi>I am truth.</hi> Neither <hi>Auſtin,</hi> nor <hi>Luther,</hi> nor <hi>Calvin</hi> can ſay, <hi>I am truth:</hi> Not that therefore the Miniſters of God are therefore to be laid aſide, becauſe they are not infallible: For God hath commanded us to hear them, and to ſubmit to them; only we are not ultimately to depend on them. The Church is called the <hi>Pillar of truth,</hi> becauſe ſhe doth declare and hold out the Truth, but, ſhe is not the Author of it. We are then to conclude of all men, that of themſelves they have no Truth, they need the Spirit of God to guide them therein: And then hereby is an Oppoſition in God to the Devil: As God is true, ſo the <hi>Devil</hi> is <hi>the Father of Liés,</hi> John 8. 44. <hi>when he ſpeaketh of his own, he ſpeaketh a lye.</hi> Now then conſider, how inexcuſable every wicked man will be. For; on the one ſide, Chriſt, who is <hi>Truth it ſelf,</hi> he ſpeaketh to the ſinner, to repent, to reforme, promiſing Everlaſting Happineſs to him: Chriſt ſaith, Thy ſinnes have no pleaſure, no profit in them; thou wilt finde them prove a lye to thee. On the other ſide: The Devil he tempteth thee, contrary to Chriſt, he telleth thee ſin is ſweet, it is good and profitable to ſin, he biddeth thee follow the luſts of thy ſoul, thou ſhalt not be damned for all that: and now thou believeſt this <hi>Devil,</hi> this <hi>Father</hi> of lies, rather than Chriſt. Oh how unſufferable is this? how great is the Patience of God towards thee? What hearken to the Devil, before God? But even thus <hi>Eve</hi> did at firſt; ſhe believed the Serpent more than God, and thereby brought ruine upon her ſelf, and Poſterity. Oh that we could convince you enough herein, that you may ſee, with what madneſs and folly your ſinnes carry you away, while you liſten to the <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> who is the Adverſary of your ſoules, rather than <hi>Chriſt;</hi> who mourneth over you, ſaying, Oh that ſuch a ſinner did know the things that maketh for his peace!</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>From this truth of God, Hence it is, that we are ſo much commanded in</hi>

                  </gap> whereas the confidence of Gods truth would preſently ſatisfie the ſoul. The firſt is, <hi>In matters to be believed</hi> about
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:48709:282"/>
the Doctrine that is delivered there: For, becauſe that is wholly <hi>ſupernatural</hi> above our humane reaſon, though not contrary to it; hence it is, that we have many fluctuations of ſpirit, and our underſtandings are with difficulty captivated unto the Word of God. Though theſe temptations about the Truths of Chriſtian Religion are not incident to all the Godly; and it is a ſpecial mercy to be preſerved from them, yet upon ſome they have come like a violent ſtorm, and therefore there is no way to ſtand diſputing, and arguing, but to ſay, <hi>God is true, the Word is true, I believe,</hi> when I cannot diſpute, as one Martyr ſaid. But then a Second temptation, which is like a continual thorn in the ſides of the Godly, is their <hi>Diffidence and distruſt about the Promiſes of God.</hi> They do not live and walk, as if they were true: So that never did any Heretick more ſubtilly cavill againſt the Doctrine of the Scripture, than they do argue againſt the Promiſes of the Scripture, Whether they be ſuch as belong to the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>to themſelves;</hi> To the <hi>Church,</hi> when they read the Scriptures, they finde ſuch glorious and excellent <hi>Promiſes;</hi> that they exſpect ſhe ſhould alwayes have <hi>Halcyon</hi> dayes, that her enemies ſhould alwayes be vanquiſhed: but alas, they finde experimentally the contrary: They cannot ſee, how Gods Words, and his Works, how his Promiſes and Providences do concurre together: But the reaſon of this is from themſelves. They do not take a right way to underſtand <hi>the truth of God</hi> in this particular, for theſe three Cauſes, which commonly make the ſenſe to erre about the Object (although, to ſpeak properly, the ſenſe doth not erre, but the judgment of a man, diſcerning according to ſence; for ſenſe would be more properly ſaid to <hi>erre,</hi> if under ſuch impediments it did not repreſent as it doth.)</p>
               <p>Firſt, One impediment in the ſenſe, is <hi>the two long diſtance of the Object from the eye:</hi> (to inſtance in this ſenfe,) As we judg the Sun leſs than the earth, becauſe of the vaſte diſtance from us, ſo that, till a man take Aſtronomical Inſtruments, and correct Senſe by Art, he misjudgeth about the Suns magnitude: thus is it here, When we go to judg of Gods Promiſes to us, or his Church, we finde not the truth of them, becauſe the wayes of God are too remote from us, his thoughts exceed ours, as much as the Heavens do the earth. Therefore we muſt neceſſarily erre, till we go to the Scripture; that is, as it were, the Artificial Inſtrumennt, whereby we are able to behold that truth in Gods proceedings, which otherwiſe we could not.</p>
               <p>A Second Impediment is, the <hi>medium indiſpoſitum,</hi> when the means of ſeeing is Indiſpoſed; as when we look upon a ſtick in the waters, or the Sun through a dark cloud. Thus, many times, when we judg of Gods proceedings according to his Promiſes, we look through Falſe <hi>mediums,</hi> we think according to the Principles that men would do in the world, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>We would think that God ſhould deſtroy Pope and Turk immediately:</hi> but all this is becauſe we look through an indiſpoſed glaſs in this particular.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The eye cannot judg right of its Object, when <hi>the viſive faculty is diſturbed,</hi> when that is infeſted with any evil humors. Thus the ſpiritual eyes even of a Godly man are in ſome meaſure vitiated, and therefore are not able to behold that glory of God in carrying on the Affairs of his Church, and by thoſe very wayes which we would think tend to the deſtruction of the things promiſed, by them he doth fulfill them; for <hi>the wayes of the Lord are wonderfull to us,</hi> in making good his Promiſes, and commonly they are fulfilled by thoſe means which ſeem contrary to them; even as he cured the blinde man, by mingling ſpittle with clay, which he laid upon his eyes. And thus the Godly ſoul may finde, how God is true in ſpiritual Promiſes to his ſoul; for he obtaineth comfort through deſertions; the way to Heaven he findes through Hell: yea, in ſanctifying Grace, he cometh to higher Degrees in Grace, even by his Failings. So true is that of <hi>Suarez,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:48709:283"/>
Aliquando ſubſtractio gratiae eſt ad finem gratiae.</hi> The end of Grace is accompliſhed by the gradual ſubſtraction and ſuſpenſion of Grace for a time. But I muſt not inlarge herein.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>This truth of God is the foundation of all Religion and Godlineſs.</hi> For, if there were no truth in the Scriptures, which are Gods truth, if <note place="margin">5. The truth of God is the Foundation of all Religion and godlineſs.</note> there were no truth in the Promiſes or Threatnings, into what a Chaos and Confuſion of wickedneſs would all men fall? There would be no difference between Hell and this World: So that Gods Truth is a Foundation of all Piety in theſe three wayes;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The truth of God in his Doctrine delivered to the Church,</hi> is the <hi>foundation,</hi> yea, the <hi>Eſſence and ſoul of his Church.</hi> In this it doth differ from <hi>Jews, Turks, and Pagans;</hi> yea, from all Heretical Societies, That ſhe hath the <hi>truth of God,</hi> and others not: So that, as the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> keepeth the body from rottenneſs, and Putrefaction. Thus alſo the truth of God keepeth the Church from being only a Carkaſe, or to have the Name and Title of a Church, without the thing it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The truth of God in his Promiſes is the great ſupporter of the hopes of all the Godly.</hi> By them alone they are enabled to walk with <hi>Peter</hi> upon the water, and ſink not, becauſe they believe Gods Promiſes to be true; they do therefore renounce all unlawfull Pleaſures and Profits; they will not leave the fatneſs and ſweetneſs of them to go to thoſe bryars.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>The truth of God in his threatnings;</hi> That is like a fiery ſword, to keep them from all evil: They know thoſe threatnings are true, and that the World and the Devil prove lyars to all thoſe that ſerve them; therefore they awe their hearts with a continuall fear of them. And certainly, if every wicked man would remember this, That Gods threatnings are true, they will be made good; no wiſdome, no greatneſs, no power can reſiſt him. For, how can the ſtubble withſtand the conſuming fire? this would make them utterly forſake their ſinnes. But whether thou wilt believe or no, Gods Curſes will fall upon thee. For there is this difference between the Promiſes and Threatnings; The Promiſes (many of them) are not made good unto them, unleſs thou do believe; believe, and thy ſinnes are forgiven thee, but the threatnings will be made good to thee, a prophane ſinner, whether thou wilt or not. Gods Word will have its effect, though thou doſt deſire it might be falſe.</p>

                  <p>The perſonal failings of Miniſters are oft cast upon the Miniſtry it ſelf.</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 18.</bibl>
                  <q>But, as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe next particular conſiderable is the occaſion of that Tranſition, which the Apoſtle maketh from the word of his Promiſe in particular, to come to them, and the word of his Preaching in the general. The occaſion is from that evill, and malevolent Diſpoſition which was in his Adverſaries, who from any, either real, or but ſuppoſed Imperfections in other things, would preſently burden his Miniſtry with it, and thereby, as much as in them lieth, make <hi>Paul</hi> wholly uſeleſs in the Church of God. Now, becauſe this is the continual ſtratagem, which the Devil uſeth to make the beſt Miniſtry ineffectual, and becauſe it is the conſtant inclination of wicked men to do ſo, therefore I ſhall purſue this Obſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there is a propenſity in wicked and evil minded men, to cast all the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wicked men uſually caſt the Imperfections of the Miniſter upon the Miniſtry.</note> 
                  <hi>imperfections of the Miniſters of the Goſpel upon their Miniſtry and Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bring the Truths they Preach either into doubt or diſeſteem, becauſe of ſome failings, yea, though they be not real, but ſuppoſed in their own Imaginations. Thus the Adverſaries of <hi>Paul,</hi> they did captiouſly lay hold upon his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and failing as they think in that, thereby they would render all his Doctrine and Miniſtry odious, that thereby their falſhoods and corruptions may have the greater ſucceſs. Thus the wickedneſs of ungodly men doth conſtantly bend to this, that they may be hardened in their hearts againſt the Word Preached; that they may fortifie themſelves with ſome damnable Principles of others, that ſo the meſſage of the Lord may be rejected.</p>
               <p>Now to illuſtrate this, conſider theſe particulars;</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That when a Miniſter either preaches falſe Doctrine, or liveth ſcandalouſly, or is lazy, and negligent in his place, then it is lawfull for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. A people may have an holy Zeal. againg a looſe ſcandalous Miniſter.</note> 
                  <hi>a people to have an holy and wiſe zeal againſt ſuch perſons, that they may be quickened up to their duties.</hi> Neither is this to be an enemy to the Office of the Miniſtry, or to endeavour the publique Diſhonour of it, but rather to advance the honor of it, who by Heretical Superſtitions, or ſcandalous manners is made contemptible to the people for Doctrine. If that which men preach, be errors, or falſhoods be the Imaginations of their own hearts, as the falſe Prophets did lies in the Old Teſtament, and, as many are ſaid to do in the New; from ſuch we are commanded to <hi>turn away;</hi> with ſuch we are not
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:48709:284"/>
ſo much as to learn any familiar commerce, no not ſo much as to bid them, <hi>God ſpeed.</hi> The Champions of <hi>Rome,</hi> they condemn the Proteſtants, for their Schiſme and Faction they made againſt the Officers of their Church; but they proved that they were Apoſtatical, not Apoſtolical; that they were wolves, not ſhepherds: yet, at the ſame time, they affirmed diligently, the Miniſtry of Chriſt, according to his Inſtitution, againſt any fanatical Spirits that did run into that extream: So, if a Miniſter live a wicked, and a <hi>ſcandalous</hi> life, though we are not to reject the ſound Doctrine, becauſe of his life, yet that ought to be a great grief and trouble to us. We are not to approve of a wicked life for the Miniſters ſake, nor to make good Sermons cover the multitude of many ſinnes: Nay, the more excellent his doctrine is, and the more raiſed his parts are, the more is his life, if wicked, to be abominated. It is true, people are very injudicious herein, and are very prone to condemn the Office, becauſe of a wicked life; but that is not to be done, we are to <hi>hear them,</hi> as our Saviour ſaid of ſome Phariſaical Doctors, but not to <hi>do as they do,</hi> Mat. 23. 3. <hi>all that the Scribes and Phariſes bad them doe, ſitting in Moſes his chair;</hi> that is, while preaching conſonantly to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Doctrine, and not adding their ſuperſtitious leaven, they were bidden to <hi>obſerve,</hi> but then they are forbidden to <hi>follow their example; They muſt not do as they do.</hi> So that what Truths ſuch Preach out of Gods Word, we are to awe our hearts with them, and to receive them as good truths; but yet, if their lives be contrary to Gods Word, they muſt not approve of them, or imitate them. Laſtly, If they be <hi>negligent</hi> and <hi>lazy,</hi> which is an intolerable ſin in a Miniſter, whoſe Names and Titles the Scripture giveth him, denoteth Labour, Pains, and Solicitude, This alſo may be juſtly complained of, and yet not in that to be thought to ſtrike at the Office of the Miniſtry. Now, there are two Extreames in this way: Some corrupt and ſcandalous Miniſters would make the world believe, when judged or cenſured, for their crimes, that it is becauſe of their Office, not their unworthineſs; that it is not their perſonal ſin, but Miniſterial imployment that is aimed at. And again, there are others, that though they pretend the ſinnes and vices of Miniſters, yet indeed are glad of any ſuch offences, do rejoyce, when they fall out, and make occaſion thereby as much as lyeth in them, to overthrow the Miniſtry it ſelf: But, both theſe delude their own ſoules; for God will own his inſtituted Office, as being a Plant of his own planting; and therefore, the Adverſaries to it may think as well to pluck the Sun out of the Heavens, as thoſe Offices Chriſt hath ſet in his Church: And on the other ſide, unfaithfull and ungodly Miniſters are to know Gods anger is more againſt them, than other wicked men, and the very ſtation they had in the Church, will tend to their greater aggravation, So that, we may diſtinguiſh between ſetting our ſelves zealouſly againſt the corruptions of unjuſtifiable Miniſters, and againſt the Office it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Secondly, <hi>Many wayes are a people prone to take offence,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. A people are oft prone to take offence at the Miniſters when yet 'tis their ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>at the Miniſtry of a man, when yet it is their ſin.</hi> They that do wickedly take an offence at a Miniſtry faithfully diſcharged; they procure inevitable ruine to their own ſoules. Theſe endeavour to put out the Light of the Sun, that ſo they may with the more boldneſs commit their ſinnes in the dark. There is a two-fold Scandal, or Offence, (as Divines uſually note.) The one is, <hi>Scandalum datum,</hi> when any ſhall give a juſt occaſion to any, to ſtumble at the Truths of God, and to depart from the way of Chriſt: Not, that ever any can have a juſt occaſion indeed. For, ſuppoſe, all the Miniſters of Chriſt, yea, and all the people that profeſs Chriſt, ſhould ſo live and walk, that Chriſtianity would be made loathſome in the world, yet a man ought not to be offended hereat, ſo as to depart from Chriſt: for he is to
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:48709:284"/>
believe the Word more than the lives or Examples of men; onely I call that a <hi>juſt occaſion,</hi> which is apparently ſo; when ſome do carry themſelves in ſuch an ungodly manner, that the weakneſs of ſome cannot but be offended at their proceedings; ſo that, they like Miniſtry and Godlineſs, the worſe, for their ſakes. Now, though this be the ſin and weakneſs of any to do ſo, yet, becauſe they adminiſtred an active occaſion thereunto, a wo is pronounced in an heavy manner to ſuch Perſons, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 1. The Scripture maketh it a terrible thing, either for Miniſters or people, ſo to live and walk, as, that thereby the wayes of God, and Godlineſs may be evil ſpoken of. But then, their is a <hi>ſcandalum acceptum,</hi> which is called <hi>Scandalum Phariſaeorum;</hi> and that, when men through their own ignorance, peeviſhneſs, or wickedneſs, do take any offence, and cry out of Religion, becauſe of ſuch and ſuch things, which they do not rightly underſtand: And this was the caſe of our Saviours Preaching, and his acceptance in the world; inſomuch, that he ſaith, <hi>Mat. 11. 6, Bleſſed is he that ſhall not be offended at me.</hi> Why, was there any thing in Chriſts Doctrine or Life, that might rationally offend any? No, but the Phariſees, and others, being Superſtitious and proud, ſeeing alſo his outward contemptibleneſs, took great offence; and thereupon they condemned Chriſt by the Law, which God made againſt Blaſphemy: They condemned Chriſt, by that very Law, which was in force againſt Blaſphemers, thinking him guilty of it, becauſe he ſaid, <hi>He was the Son of God,</hi> John 19. 7. Now, the many wayes that may be taken ſinfully, to ſet againſt the Miniſtry, and to lay all the Burden upon that, are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>when we, out of a cavilling and quarrelling temper, diſlike that, which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. When they diſlike that, which may be of great uſe.</note> 
                  <hi>if well underſtood, would be of great uſe to us;</hi> So that, many times, when the whole fault lieth upon our dulneſs, our miſtakes, our Ignorance, and weakneſs, we are ready to charge it upon the Miniſtry. Thus we have heretofore inſtanced in <hi>John</hi> 6. 60, 61. concerning thoſe Diſciples, who murmured at Chriſts Expreſſions; and were ſo offended, that they departed wholly from him: So that, he who would not go off from the Miniſtry, is to avoid a quarrelſome, cavilling diſpoſition; which ſome are very prone unto; but, it is a very great Judgement to be left to ſuch a temper; For herein they do every day more and more obſtruct their own Converſion, and prepare themſelves to be combuſtible matter in Hell. Indeed, a modeſt, and humble enquiry into the Truths preached, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, about <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching, is allowed and commendable; but, a froward, cavilling Diſpoſition indiſpoſeth to finde out the Truth, and is like ſome fretting humour in the eye, which hindreth the ſight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We then do ſinfully oppoſe the Miniſtry, when we ſtrive and contend with them,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. When they are offended at his reproveing ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe of their zealous and faithfull reproving and withſtanding the courſe of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe a Miniſter would bring thee to the ſight of thy ſinnes, to a deep and ſerious Humiliation, becauſe of them, becauſe he would recover thee out of thoſe damnable wayes thou liveſt in: Hence it is, that thou cryeſt down the Miniſtry, and their Labours: This is the true ground of moſt mens calumny, and malice; becauſe the word Preached is a convincing Word, a reproveing Word, a diſcovering Word, of that evil and wrethchedneſs, which is in thy heart: Hence it is, that thy ſoul cannot endure the meſſengers thereof; This is not meerly to be wicked, but Diabolicaly wicked. And yet, if many Deſpiſers of the Miniſtry were asked, What is it that moveth them to ſuch deſpite againſt the Officers of Chriſt, They would, but for ſhame, ſpeak that which lieth in the bottome of their heart, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Miniſtry diſcovereth unto them all the evil they have done; That is, ſpeaketh onely evil and Damnation to them, and therefore they cannot abide it; but, wo be to that man who ſtriveth with a Miniſter, doing his duty. That, becauſe he telleth thee
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:48709:285"/>
the truth, he dealeth faithfully with thy ſoul; therefore thou doſt become an enemy to him. Conſider that place, <hi>Hoſ. 4. 4. Let no man reprove another, for this people are as they that ſtrive with the Prieſt.</hi> The meaning is, It is to no purpoſe, to reprove the wicked men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> any more: it is to no purpoſe to bring them balme, or ſpiritual Medicines, for they are an incurable people, Why, how doth this appear? In that, <hi>they ſtrive with the Prieſt.</hi> They will not et him do his duty. If he reprove them for ſin, if he ſet againſt their iniquities, they riſe up as proudly againſt him, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> did againſt <hi>Lot,</hi> their Preacher of righteouſneſs. By this you ſee, its a property of a deſperate and incurable people when they ſtrive with their Church-Officers, in doing of their Duty. Indeed, if Miniſters ſhould pervert the Ordinances of God, endeavour to bring in Hereſies, Superſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition, and Prophaneneſs, to exalt the Kingdome of darkneſs, then they are in all lawfull and wiſe wayes to ſtrive with them, even as Children may, in ſome caſes reprove their Parents, who are deſperately ſet to damn their ſoules, provided they ſhew that Reverence and Humility that they ought to do. This Text of the Prophet is made uſe of by the Papiſts, who charge our Reformers, that they did ſtrive with the Pope, and their Biſhops, refuſing ſubmiſſion to them. For their Canoniſts have a ſaying, <hi>That, if the Pope ſhould draw thouſands of ſoules to Hell, none might ſay unto him, why dost thou ſo?</hi> But this place will not be a Sanctuary to them; for if we take the ordinary expoſition, and common one, which I have given (there being another by-Learned man, who maketh directly againſt them) it ſpeaketh of ſuch a people, who, do ſinfully ſtrive with the Meſſengers of God, becauſe they reprove ſin, and zealouſly do their Duty. This is the higheſt Degree of ſinfull Oppoſition that can be, no conteſting with the Miniſtry is ſo heynous, as when it cometh upon this account. Theſe are like frenetique men, who fight with their Phyſician. In other diſeaſes commonly men ſend for phyſicians, they deſire their help; but the mad man, he will ne re ſend for any, and if any be brought to him he rageth at them. Thus doth ſuch wicked men, and ſo are like a ground Hiſtorians ſpeak of, that is dryer by the rain that falleth upon it, and the more drought, the more moyſture.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Then we ſinfully reflect upon the Ministry, when the vices of the perſons, we</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. When they caſt the ſaults of the perſons upon their Office and Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>caſt upon their office and Doctrine.</hi> This was that which made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo di ligent and zealous in this Text; had it been his own glory and name, he would more patiently have born it. But when they come hereby to diſparage his Doctrines, to call that in queſtion, then he could no longer bare it. Take heed then of this diſpoſition, upon any evils, or faillings in them, preſently to fall upon the Calling, immediately to diſlike the Doctrine they preach. For, though it ought not to be ſo, yet we are naturally ready <hi>ex perſonis probare fidem,</hi> not <hi>ex fide Perſonas,</hi> We are ready to like and approve of Faith, as we approve of mens perſons, and therefore, if any failing or weakneſs be ſeen in them, we preſently charge their Doctrine with it. What ſhould a man have refuſed all that <hi>Peter ſaid,</hi> thinking, it is no matter what he Preacheth, becauſe, in his fear and temptation he denied Chriſt? What, ſhall a man exclaim at <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſay, we know not how to believe, what he Preacheth? For, he was once as hot and zealous for the contrary way. Oh, take heed of ſuch ungodly Judgment. The Truth is Chriſts Truth; the Goſpel is the Goſpel of God, however men may fail.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This is ſtill the more abominable, when men take falſe rumors and ſlanders</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. When they refuſe the Miniſtry upon falſe Rumors and Surmiſes.</note> 
                  <hi>up, or go upon their own ſurmiſes, and conjectures, and thereby refuſe the Miniſtry: for this was Pauls caſe.</hi> He had juſt grounds, as is in time to be ſhewed, why he did not come to them, as he promiſed. <hi>It was to ſpare them,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 23. So that, if there were any fault, they were the cauſe of it, yet, how readily do they make an occaſion, to bring <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctine out of credit, and nothing is more ordinary than this, for men to feign Reaſons, and pretend many abſurd Arguments to vilifie the work of the Miniſtry, which yet is appointed by God,

For, hereby his Kingdome will be lift up: ſo that, as the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> were never quiet till they had deprived <hi>Sampſon</hi> of that which was his ſtrength, ſo neither is the Devil and his Inſtruments ever at reſt, till they have removed that ſtrength Chriſt hath appointed for the deſtroying of the works of the Devil.</p>

                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 18.</bibl>
                  <q>Our word toward you, was not yea, and nay.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WE are now arrived at the laſt particular conſiderable in this Text, and that is the firmneſſe and conſtancy of the Doctrine that <hi>Paul</hi> preached to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> You heard that malevolent adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries from a ſuppoſed levity in <hi>Paul,</hi> otherwiſe did preſently argue to an inconſtancy in his Doctrine. And although this was but once, they could not charge ſuch an appearing levity upon <hi>Paul</hi> often. It was but at one time, yet how ready were they to take an advantage hereby againſt Gods truth. It is true, the verity and firmneſſe of Gods truths doth not depend upon the eſteem of Miniſters, his word is ſure, though men be vain and inconſtant; yet by this inſtance we ſee, how much it concerneth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel to abound in gravity, ſincerity and conſtancy; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo to deport themſelves, that the Doctrine they preach may not be ſuſpected of changeableneſſe, as if they would preach that for Gods truth one time, which afterwards they would preach to be the Devils lie. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> doth here renounce, <hi>Our word toward you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was not yea and nay,</hi> that is, it was not light, mutable, it was not white and black, hot and cold, but it was alwayes the ſame conſtant abiding truth. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That for a Miniſter to be mutable and contradictory in his Doctrine, is very reproachfull to him, and makes his Miniſtry wholly uſeleſſe <note place="margin">'Tis a great reproach for a Miniſter to be mutable and contradictory in his doctrine</note>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes to preach one way, as the way of God; one opinion as the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth of God, and then afterwards to preach up the clean contrary, this debaſeth the perſon, and the office of a man, it maketh all his Miniſtry to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed: They conclude either that ſuch a man thinketh there is no Religion at all, or at leaſt, that he is either <hi>Atheiſtical,</hi> believing none, or elſe very ignorant, or carnal, and ſelf-ſeeking; that with <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple, doth judge that only Religion, which is profitable, and therefore meaſure the truths of Doctrines by their intereſt and carnal emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments. In the Old Teſtament we read of many ſuch lying Prophets, who did not propheſie according to the viſions of the Lord, but from the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their own hearts, preached to Kings and people ſuch pleaſing things as they deſired. This hath done a world of hurt in the Church of God, when the officers therein have not regarded, whether the things they preach were Gods truths, but whether pleaſing to men, or no. This was to make the Sunne to follow the Dial, and the truth of God ſhall no longer
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:48709:286"/>
be truth, but while it pleaſeth man. Now ſuch men, that are thus mutable, muſt needs be accounted tranſgreſſours by all. For ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If I build the things againe, I once deſtroyed, I make my ſelfe a tranſgreſſour, Galat.</hi> 2. 18. This Doctrine deſerveth ſerious examination, becauſe as there is much truth in it, and thereby much good may be done: So occaſionally through miſtake, men may be prejudiced to their own hurt. For did not the Papiſts brand the Reformers at firſt with inconſtancy and perfidiouſneſſe, that they were nothing but <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay?</hi> For formerly they came to the Maſſe, they worſhipped Images, they acknowledged the Pope as well as they: But then of a ſudden they were all changed, then the Pope was <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> then the <hi>Maſſe</hi> was <hi>blasphemous Idolatry,</hi> then they puiled down their <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Images.</hi> Thus ſay the Papiſts, they were <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay.</hi> And in our age, Are there not many offended, becauſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel do not keep up the ſame Church-adminiſtrations, as they once did, that they do not pray, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, adminiſter the Lords Supper, in the ſame way as once they did? If it was no ſinne then, why is it now? Thus they think there is much inconſtancy and levity in Miniſters, becauſe they ſee ſuch changes and alterations in their publick adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore abide the longer upon this truth, ſeeing the Text doth give ſuch ſeaſonable advantages thereunto. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, You muſt know, <hi>That all yea and nay is not bad.</hi> There may be a <note place="margin">1. All changes are not bad.</note> time, when he that hath been for a <hi>Yea</hi> a long time in Religion, muſt if ever he will be ſaved, come to a <hi>Nay.</hi> There is ſometimes a neceſſity of changing, and that is, when people and Miniſters have been carried away with errours and falſe wayes. Though ſuch things may plead antiquity, though you may urge preſcription for many hundred years, yet upon conviction and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are to <hi>change</hi> from <hi>yea,</hi> we are to bewail ſuch errours as we once li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in. Was it not thus with <hi>Paul?</hi> Though <hi>Paul</hi> was not now <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> ſince he was an Apoſtle, yet he was once ſo; neither was that to his diſpraiſe, but his honour in the Church of God. Did not <hi>Paul</hi> once violently perſecute that way, which afterwards he preached for? Thoſe traditions and phariſaical ſuperſtitions which once he maintained, even to the killing of all the oppoſers thereof; Doth not he in time, with as much zeal renounce them, as ever once he did plead for them? This change of <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo wonderfull that <hi>Act. 9. 21. Many who heard him preach Chriſt, were amazed, ſaying, Is not this he, that deſtroyed them, who called on this Name in Jeruſalem?</hi> You ſee then that there may be a juſt occaſion to change our opinions, our practices in Religion. There is a juſt occaſion for a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Turke,</hi> to leave his Religion, and become a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> There is a juſt occaſion for Papiſts and Hereticks to forſake that way of worſhip, they have followed with ſo much zeal and devotion. Neither may they fear the ſhame and reproach of being accounted <hi>weather-cocks</hi> and <hi>turn-coats;</hi> but rather they have cauſe to bleſſe God, who hath opened their eyes, and not ſuffered them to periſh in the <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Sodome</hi> they were in. It is true naturally, it is accounted an hainous ſinne to <hi>change</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which a man is born and bred up in. Therefore we have an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our King <hi>John, (Fuller. Hiſtor. of the Church)</hi> who being in great State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extremities, ſent to the King of the <hi>Moors</hi> for aid and aſſiſtance, promiſing him his Kingdom if he would, and that the Nation ſhould receive the <hi>Turkiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> But the <hi>Morocco</hi> King refuſed the offer, ſaying, <hi>That he had lately read</hi> Paul'<hi>s Epiſtles, and did like the matter well, ſo that he found no fault with</hi> Paul, <hi>but becauſe he changed the Religion he was born in.</hi> I bring this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſhew, what a great influence that Religion hath, let it be falſe or true, upon a man, in which he hath been educated. Yet there is a neceſſity, if men will be ſaved, ſometimes of forſaking that Religion our Fathers and
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:48709:287"/>
Anceſtours have lived in. For ſeeing that is directly againſt Scripture, that <hi>any man in any Religion may be ſaved:</hi> and alſo that ſeeing there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny contrary Religions in the world, it followeth inevitably, that there are ſome in ſuch damnable wayes, and that of Religion, that without repentance, and coming out of thoſe former impieties, they ſhall never eſcape the eternal flames of hell; and ſuch a change is not matter of reproach, but it is the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull converſion of Gods grace upon our hearts. Hence the Apoſtle doth ſo often admire the riches of Gods grace to thoſe <hi>Heathens,</hi> who were delivered out of that ignorance and darkneſſe, with the abominable impieties they once lived in. As it is in Philoſophy, they diſtinguiſh of alteration or change, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>deſtructiva</hi> or <hi>perfectiva.</hi> Thus when a man of a fool is made wiſe, of a vicious perſon, virtuous, here is a perfective alteration: ſo it is alſo in the matters of Religion, we may change the beſt errour for truth, darkneſſe for light. It is not then enough to ſay, Thou wilt not change thy principles, thy way of Religion, thou haſt been born in them, and thy Anceſtours have lived in the ſame way; for this every <hi>Jew,</hi> every <hi>Turke</hi> may plead as well as thou. The <hi>Heathens</hi> pleaded this againſt the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Sequendi ſunt patres qui foeliciter ſunt ſuos ſequuti, contumelioſa eſt emendatio ſenectutis.</hi> If this be true, why art thou not a Papiſt ſtill? Why doeſt thou not call for the Maſſe and Church-duties to be done in <hi>Latine?</hi> For this was the way thy Anceſtours were brought up in.</p>
               <p>Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>It is not ſimply the Yea and Nay that is to be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. But 'tis a ſin and reproach to change from the truth</note> 
                  <hi>blamed, but when it is in the truth, when we ought to be conſtant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable therein.</hi> As every party doth brand another with Heretick, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, Apoſtate, ſo alſo with inconſtancy; but it is not the meer names, but the reality that maketh ſuch perſons. If then a man holds Gods truth, he is no Heretick, though the whole world ſhould condemn him. He that hath a Scripture-ground to depart from the Idolatries of the Church, is no Schiſmatick, though others charge him with it, for <hi>Cauſa non ſeparatio fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Schiſmaticum.</hi> Thus if a man forſake his former errours, his former ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions; if he leave his corrupt Doctrines, this mans change is a duty, he is not to be blamed for it; but if a man leave the truth, if he forſake the way of God, then his <hi>Yea and Nay</hi> is to be reproved. If then you ſee a man, leaving one opinion after another, one practice after another, ſo that all this while it is a progreſſe in the truths of Chriſt, this man is the more to be encouraged. For ſuch is the pertinacy of man, and love to his owne credit and glory, that it muſt be ſome great cauſe, which ſhall make him retract and recant that which he did once zealouſly profeſſe; ſo that it is in Doctrinals, as in morals; if you ſee a man that hath for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years wallowed in his luſts, that hath been glewed to them, ſo that he appeared, <hi>Non tam peccator, quam ipſum peccatum;</hi> if this man through the grace of God be converted do contrary to all that once he did, ſhall this man be derided, becauſe he will not be the ſame prophane perſon, that once he hath been? No, God rather is to be glorified; who made the prodigal that was loſt to be found, that was dead to live again?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Although thus to increaſe in knowledge and light, whereby we leave off doing the things we once did, be thus a duty, yet even ſuch a change</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Even ſuch a change ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuppoſeth an imperfection in a man.</hi> For were our underſtandings fully illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, we ſhould be able to ſee the truths of God, at the very firſt; light would not come in ſucceſſively upon us, and by degrees diſpelling darkneſſe, as we ſee the Sunne doth in the morning, but it would be in its vertical point immediately. Even as <hi>Photius</hi> reporteth out of an Hiſtorian <hi>Agatharcides,</hi> that there are a people to whom the Sunne doth not appear by degrees, as to us, but it cometh ſuddenly and perfectly upon them, out of the depth
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:48709:287"/>
of darkneſſe. It is true therefore our weakneſſe and imperfection, not that we come to know things better than we did, or that we are changed, but becauſe we needed ſuch an alteration: <hi>We know but in part,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. putting himſelf into the number. Hence it is that in Heaven, when our underſtandings ſhall be fully perfected, then we ſhall not grow in knowledge, we ſhall not imbrace errours, and upon further illumination leave them. So that whenſoever God ſhall make ſuch a change upon us, that we are not to believe, as we have done, worſhip as we have done, lived as we have done: As we are to be thankfull unto God, ſo we are to be humble in our ſelves, becauſe that ever any darkneſſe did take hold of us. The <hi>Thomiſts</hi> among the Schoolmen, give this for a reaſon, why the good Angels proved conſtantly good, and the evil Angels unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably evil: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Such is the perfection of the Angelical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that what it willeth, it willeth immoveably, it cannot alter again, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an evil Angel cannot repent.</hi> I ſhall not juſtifie this reaſon; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſee it a glorious perfection in God, that his underſtanding is infinite, his will immutable; ſo that he cannot know any new thing, or will any new thing, which he did not from eternity: Yea the eſtate of the glorified Saints in Heaven, is admirable in this particular, that they are ſo confirmed by grace, they are ſo perfectly enlightned and ſanctified, that they receive all truth at firſt, and can never come to know more or better, then they did at firſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into that glorious place.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is no man living, though never ſo learned and ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. No man but may know more than he doth.</note> 
                  <hi>but may ſtill underſtand more.</hi> In him there may be, there will be <hi>Yeas</hi> and <hi>Nayes:</hi> He will have cauſe to confeſſe he was in this errour once, he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood ſuch and ſuch Texts of Scripture formerly. Doth not experience confirm this? Hence are their retractations, their recognitions and reviews of their works, which they have put out with much judgement and deliberation. So that we are not to wonder, if the moſt excellent and learned men do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay, <hi>This I thought once, and this was my judgement once, but now I am better informed.</hi> It is true, the caſe of the Apoſtles, and ſuch as were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired of old, is different from the moſt eminent, holy and learned men that are in the Church; for though after their firſt call by Chriſt, they did retain ſome ignorance upon them, yea did erre in ſome doctrinal points of great conſequence, yet after they received the holy Ghoſt, in a full confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them in their Office, then they were made infallible; ſo that in their preaching and writing they could not erre: And therefore if there had been any <hi>Yea and Nay,</hi> any contrariety in their Doctrine. If any of them ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Thus I thought once, but it was my errour, I am now of another mind,</hi> this would have made us queſtioned their immediate call from God; but all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers that are to guide the Church, they are not to expect ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, neither ſhould people look for ſuch aſſiſtance upon us; but we are limitted to the Scripture, as the Rule by which all ſpirits are to be tried. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any eminent Officer of the Church do build hay and ſtubble upon the foundation of precious ſtone and pearle, wonder not at it: Or if you ſee ſuch afterwards more enlightned, and to bewaile the hay and ſtubble they have built. Let not this make you ſtagger; ſo as to think with your ſelves, what can we believe? For they may erre in one thing as well as another; and as they confeſſe they have taught falſe in one particular, ſo it may be in all the reſt, and therefore we are not bound to believe them at <note place="margin">5. We muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt what is, and what is not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</note> all. For</p>
               <p>In the fifth place, <hi>You muſt diſtinguiſh between that which is fundamental in a word, and that which is</hi> circa, <hi>or</hi> ſupra <hi>fundamental.</hi> The word of God containeth in it all things that are neceſſary to ſalvation, but withall it hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:48709:288"/>
excellent concluſions that are deduceable from them. It hath not onely the foundation ſtones, but an excellent and glorious ſuperſtructure: It hath not onely milk for the babe, but ſtrong meat for the adult perſon. And although there be no truth revealed in the Scripture, which when ſufficiently propoſed to us, we ought to deſpiſe, it being the truth of the holy Ghoſt: and wilfully to oppoſe any known truth of Gods word, though it be farre from the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, is a very damnable ſinne, and rebellion againſt the Spirit of God; yet for all that, we muſt alwayes diſtinguiſh between the <hi>fundamentals</hi> and <hi>principles of Religion</hi> (ſuch as are named, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.) and the <hi>concluſions,</hi> by many <hi>mediums</hi> deduced from them; between the ſeed and the crop; between the eſſentials and the acceſſories. For there is no godly man, much leſſe no godly Officer, that is ſo farre left by God, as to erre in <hi>fundamentals of ſalvation,</hi> at leaſt perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and therefore they have no <hi>Yea, and Nay</hi> in them. For they have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, which is, <hi>That the Spirit ſhall lead them into all truth,</hi> John 16. 13. And they have alſo the anointing, <hi>which will teach them all things, 1 John</hi> 2. 27. where <hi>by all things,</hi> is not meant, <hi>Omne ſcibile, Every thing that may be known;</hi> for then they ſhould know all the arts, and all the tongues, every one would be wiſer than <hi>Solomon.</hi> No nor <hi>all things in Religion,</hi> not <hi>all things in faith and manners,</hi> for that would contradict other places, which ſay, <hi>We know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. and alſo, <hi>That we are to grow in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. but <hi>all things neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> They ſhall not want the knowledge of that thing, the abſence whereof will damn them. It may be for a ſeaſon, they may be involved in ſome fundamental errour, even as they may in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their lives fall into ſome groſsimpieties, that do for the preſent take away the preſent claim that they have to the Kingdom of Heaven; but at laſt they ſhall be delivered, becauſe it's not poſſible the elect ſhould be <hi>deceived,</hi> viz. <hi>totally and finally,</hi> by the moſt deceiveable wayes of falſhood that are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. Now the knowledge of this is neceſſary to obviate that Objection, which you heard mentioned. If the Miniſters of the Goſpel may be <hi>Yea and Nay in ſome things, why not in all things? If they erre in one thing, why not in every thing?</hi> This is not to be yeelded unto. For they cannot erre in neceſſaries, though they may in acceſſories; They cannot lay any other foundation than what is laid, yet they may build hay and ſtubble. Therefore it's ſenſleſs and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational to argue from any errour or miſtake the Miniſters may have in ſome points of Religion, that are problematical, to thoſe that are eſſential. For in theſe later we are ſure, we are never deceived, we may with <hi>Paul</hi> confidently ſay, <hi>If an Angel from Heaven preach contrary to that Doctrine, let him be accurſed.</hi>

               <p>WE are purſuing this truth, <hi>That inconſtancy and contrariety in the Doctrine of Miniſters, is a very great reproach to them.</hi> For the diſcovering whereof we have brought in ſome particulars, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon the ſame account. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We muſt alwayes diſtinguiſh between conſtancy and pertinacy; for theſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. We muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and pertinancy.</note> 
                  <hi>differ as much as light and darkneſſe, though one may ſeem very like the other.</hi> Inſomuch that the raſh, wilfull pertinacy of ſome men in their wayes and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, though never ſo falſe, is gloried in by them, as true conſtancy. Never is ſinne more ready to deceive us, then when it cometh in truths mantle, when the Devil appeareth like <hi>Samuel.</hi> For then this luſtre and gliſtering doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, taking vice for vertue, that we cannot be brought into any way of amendment. But this we muſt reſolve upon, That conſtancy and pertinacy, they differ as much as evil and good. To be a conſtant man is a duty; to be a pertinacious man is a ſinne. If you ſee a Papiſt, or an Heretick, that will endure the greateſt torment, ere he will be <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> as often it falleth out: This man is not to be commended for conſtancy, but condemned for his wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pertinacy. So that among many other differences <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy</hi> are diſcriminated in their object; for <hi>conſtancy</hi> hath alwayes that which is <hi>good and true</hi> for its object, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected in a good thing,</hi> Gal. 4. 18. ſo it is good to be <hi>conſtant,</hi> and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in that which is a duty. But then <hi>pertinacy</hi> is alwayes in that which is falſe and evil; and therefore is commonly made to be a neceſſary concomitant of an heretical perſon. Though he hold a grievous errour, yet if he doth it not with <hi>pertinacy</hi> after frequent admonitions and convictions, he is not judged an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick; according to that known ſaying of <hi>Auſtins, Errare poſſum, Haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus eſſe nolo.</hi> The Apoſtle alſo ſuppoſeth wilfulneſſe and refractorineſſe in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. when he biddeth us, <hi>Reject an heretick after the firſt and ſecond admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> implying that thereby he hath fully diſcovered his <hi>pertinacy,</hi> and ſo his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibility. If then in a ſacred Oath, wherein we ſolemnly call upon God as a witneſſe, when it is about a ſinfull and ungodly thing, it is our duty to break it. It was <hi>Herod</hi>'s ſinne, that he would fullfill his oath; then how much more, if thou art in an erroneous, or in a ſinfull and ungodly way to go on wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and wilt not change thy mind whatſoever cometh of it? This pertinacy
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:48709:289"/>
is alſo ſeen in wicked men, who will not be reformed; though the Miniſtry be never ſo potent and effectual; though light penetrate never ſo ſecretly into their breaſts, yet like <hi>Balaam</hi> they go on deſperately againſt the Angel of God, with a ſword in his hand, and glory that they are no changelings; whereas, is to be of another mind, were alwayes ſinne, their repentance would be a vice, and not a virtue. For what is that, but to be of another mind, to change our minds? whether it be in doctrinal errours, or practical impieties, there muſt be a repentance, a changing of our minds, elſe we ſhall never enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven. Remember then this difference, be a <hi>conſtant man,</hi> not a <hi>pertinacious, ſelf-willed man.</hi> The former's <hi>Yea, yea;</hi> and <hi>Nay, nay,</hi> in a good ſenſe; the later in a bad ſenſe. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Bray a fool in a morter, yet his fooliſhneſſe will not depart from him,</hi> Prov. 27. 22. What is he therefore to be commended, becauſe he will not be changed? Yea, this change from all evil of mind, or life, is ſo neceſſary, that God hath appointed his Miniſtry for this end. For this end he afflicteth and chaſtiſeth, that we ſhould be men of other minds, of other perſwaſions than we have been. <hi>Arrianus's Epictetus</hi> hath a Chapter <hi>(Lib. 2. cap.</hi> 15.) againſt ſuch who will contumaciouſly perſiſt in what they have decreed; and inſtanceth in a friend, who had decreed to famiſh and ſtarve himſelf, and was hardly perſwaded to the contrary, meerly becauſe he would be as good as his purpoſe: whereas, firſt, we are to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing decreed be good and right or no. Mad men have ſtrength, but they put it out in a furious way; ſo erroneous and wicked men, they will be the ſame, they will not alter or change; but this is in a ſinfull and damnable way. Oh that we could ſee many putting a <hi>Nay</hi> upon their former <hi>Yea!</hi> To cry as he did, <hi>Ego non ſum ego:</hi> for unleſſe ſuch do become changed, they are ſure to periſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Then therefore is yea and nay ſo reproachfull, when they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Then is it a reproach to change, when we change from truth.</note> 
                  <hi>from truth as well as errour, as alſo from corrupt and light motives.</hi> Some have an inconſtancy and levity of mind, they do not adhere long to any one thing. Theſe want ſolidity and weight, and therefore are like feathers and ſtraws that are blown up and down with every wind of Doctrine. Theſe are children wanting ſound judgement, and ſo are eaſily deluded. Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle exhorteth, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 14. That we be not as children toſſed up and down with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> How many are there that do not adhere to the truths of God upon conſtant divine motives, but light and corrupt, whereby it cometh to paſſe, that they have <hi>Annuam &amp; menſtruam fidem;</hi> They have a <hi>daily, monethly and yearly faith;</hi> and we may truly ſay of them, what <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi> by ſcorn, deriding the diviſion of faith, given by Proteſtants, <hi>Illis enim tot ſunt fides, quot ſunt in lyrâ.</hi> It is this unſetledneſs and inconſtancy, that maketh the Proteſtant Religion ſo reproached by Papiſts; herein they boaſt; by this they inſinuate, that you Proteſtants go from Religion to Religion, from opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to opinion, and have no <hi>huc uſque,</hi> but change their perſwaſions, as often as their faſhions. Now it muſt be granted, that ſuch giddineſſe and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, doth not conſiſt with a ſound faith and judgement. Men may be very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and yet very unſetled in their judgement. Who will not acknowledge that <hi>Grotius</hi> was to be honoured for his learning? But his inconſtancy was the dead flie in his box of ointment. Hence <hi>Rivet</hi> relateth of him, That when he was in priſon, ſome interceded with Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> for his liberty; but the Prince denied, and pointing to the weather-cock upon his houſe, ſaid, <hi>En caput Grotii.</hi> On the other ſide, it was the commendation of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> that he was not as a <hi>reed ſhaken with every wind.</hi> When we have once tried all things, and found out the truth, then we are to hold it faſt; we are not to be alwayes enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſeeking; this is perpetually to erre in the wilderneſſe, and never come into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Pray therefore to God againſt inconſtancy and unſetledneſſe in
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:48709:289"/>
mind in matters of Religion, ſuch a temptation hath fallen ſo foully upon ſome, that it hath even brought a diſtraction upon them. It is a mercy to be ſetled upon the Rock, to be rounded upon the truth, and then to be immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; whereas the doubting and divided mind, is never ſatisfied, and flieth from one thing to another, never having any reſt. If then thy ſaith be true, believe as thou haſt done; if thy worſhip of God be according to his will, continue to do as thou haſt done; and ſo if thy life be according to Gods command, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change it, thou canſt not do better; onely be ſure thy foundation be truly laid, and then abhorre all temptations and opinions that would bring thee to doubting; for here will be no end, thou will be in daily reſtleſſe thoughts of ſoul. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>A double-minded man is unſtable in all his wayes,</hi> Jam. 1. 6, 7. He is like a <hi>wave toſſed up and down in the Sea.</hi> Oh how unfit and unable are ſuch to confeſſe the truth before a crooked generation, to give witneſſe to it by the loſſe of the deareſt comforts they doe enjoy, when they do not know whether it be Gods truth, or mans errour that they plead for?</p>
               <p>Now you may ask, <hi>What are the cauſes procreant of ſuch lightneſſe and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The cauſes of inconſtancy. 1. Ignorance.</note> 
                  <hi>inconſtancy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when we are not able of our ſelves to judge what is the truth of God, but receive it wholly from truſt by tradition. This traditional Religion, receiving things meerly from men, and becauſe of their authority, muſt needs make men change, as that changeth. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath a full expreſſion to this, <hi>The fool believeth every word, but the prudent man looketh well to his going,</hi> Prov. 14. 15. The more ignorant then a Miniſtry is, the more credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous it is; and ſo is like the <hi>materia prima,</hi> ready to receive different formes and ſhapes; when a mans faith is wholly borrowed, and he liveth by another mans faith, not his own; when he ſhutteth his own eyes, and will onely ſee by another mans, then he muſt call black, white; and white, black, as often as thoſe will have him do ſo, upon whom he doth depend. If then it be a ſhame for a private Chriſtian not to live by his own faith, and to reſolve all into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit belief of others; Is it not much more an hainous ſinne in Miniſters, who are to be guides, and to lead others?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>An affectation of ſingularity and vain-glory in a Miniſter, may</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Affectation of ſingularity and vain-glory</note> 
                  <hi>make him to be Yea and Nay.</hi> He ſeeth that by holding and preaching the old known way, he ſhall not be much admired; and therefore as people runne in multitudes to new ſights, ſo they do to ſuch who bring unheard of opinions. This hath been one of the chiefeſt cauſes of all the hereſies and errours that ever have been in the Church; they have been weary of the accuſtomed Manna; they have like the <hi>Athenians</hi> been alwayes enquiring into what new thing is brought forth. And hereupon, as pride in apparel doth alwayes bring forth new faſhions; ſo pride in Religion, new opinions. And hence it is, that men affect new words, new phraſes, new expreſſions, yea and new Doctrines; all which cauſeth a mutability and change. Now ſurely, if a man ever did find the lively power of the truths of God, he once profeſſed, upon his own heart; when he ſhould at any time be invited to taſte of <hi>new wine,</hi> he would ſay, <hi>the old is better.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> knew, that with Chriſt alone was eternal life, then he ſaith, <hi>Whither ſhall we goe?</hi> John 6. 68. <hi>Or to whom ſhall we goe?</hi> We cannot be better than we are. Now the other Diſciples had not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taſted of the good Word of God; they depart from Chriſt, and never follow him more. We may ſay then to all thoſe unſtable ſoules, who wander from one opinion to another, and ſo from truth to falſhoods many time; Why doe ye leave the Fountain to go to the Ciſterns? Why do ye leave the fatneſſe of the Olive, and the ſweetneſſe of the Vine, to go to the Briar?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:48709:290"/>
Thirdly, Another cauſe of changeableneſſe, is, <hi>Love to profit, to earthly greatneſſe, and worldly advantages.</hi> There is none addicted to this, but he muſt be <hi>Yea and Nay,</hi> often and often again. Muſt not the ſhadow alter oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſometimes longer, ſometimes ſhorter, ſometimes ſtreight, and ſometimes bowed down, becauſe it wholly followeth the body, and hath its dependence thereon? So it is here, when men regard Religion only for politick and ſelf-ſeeking ends, then they muſt be hot and cold, they muſt be bitter and ſweet, as their intereſt requireth. This hath alwayes made <hi>Ecebolius</hi>'s in the Church; onely it were well, if at laſt they would bewail this carnality, this inconſtancy; as <hi>Ecebolius</hi> did, throwing himſelf down before the Church gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, crying out, <hi>Calcate me inſipidum ſalem.</hi> This made one Biſhop be ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Euripus,</hi> for his frequent compliances and accommodations of himſelf, that thereby he might be advanced.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Another cauſe, though external, is, <hi>The example of others.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Examples.</note> When an whole Church, or an whole Nation, becometh <hi>Yea and Nay,</hi> then it is very difficult to be immoveable. To be onely <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> when the whole world is <hi>Arrian,</hi> that is difficult. We are apt to think that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is patronage enough for any inconſtancy. Though we judge the uſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Religion ſuperſtitious, yet we are ready to ſay, as he did, <hi>Eamus ad communem errorem.</hi> Hence it is that we read ſome Nations have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Popiſh Religion, and then after that Proteſtantiſme, and ſo change them mutually again. Now unleſſe a man be bottomed upon divine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he cannot be <hi>Lot</hi> in a <hi>Sodome;</hi> he cannot be like that River that emptieth it ſelf into the brackiſh Sea, and yet keeps its own ſweetneſſe. Not to turn when all turn, argueth there muſt be ſome ſtrong principle within, ſome life within, elſe the dead fiſh would be carried away with the ſtream.</p>
               <p>The concluſive particular to clear this whole Diſcourſe, and which will antidote againſt the Objection at firſt mentioned, is this; We muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh <note place="margin">We muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials in Religion.</note> between the <hi>Eſſentials of Religion,</hi> and <hi>External formes thereof, which are mutable and changeable.</hi> It may be the ſame <hi>Eſſential Religion</hi> ſull, though the form of adminiſtrations may alter; even as it is the ſame man ſtill, though he wear change of garments. This is on purpoſe mentioned to diſcover the ignorance of thoſe, who charge levity and inconſtancy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Miniſters of the Goſpel, becauſe they uſe not the ſame publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgyl, nor adminiſter Sacraments in the ſame order and forme, as was formerly. Yea ſome are ſo farre ſcandalized, as to think this is the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Proteſtant Religion; but all this is built upon a falſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if Proteſtant Religion were built upon Church-formes of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if that were ſo, then there would be many Proteſtant Religions, becauſe ſeveral Proteſtant Churches have alwayes had ſeveral formes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; ſome more pure than other, though all retaining the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Religion. Religion then is the ſame ſtill, and the Miniſters of the Goſpel are the ſame ſtill; we have alſo the ſame way ſtill to Heaven, and the ſame Chriſt our Mediatour, though the forme of Church-adminiſtrations be altered; we have publick prayer ſtill, and the ſame Scripture-matter that is to be put in prayer, only the form is altered; and ſo about the Sacraments onely the order may be altered. If therefore this offend thee, and cauſe thee to think that Miniſters are light and inconſtant, it is thy own ignorance; as if wine were altered, becauſe emptied into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cups. Yea it cannot appear out of good antiquity for many years, that ever the primitive Chriſtians meeting together in a Church-way, for the ſolemne adminiſtration of Chriſts Ordinances, ever had any publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, or ſet forme. For as for thoſe Liturgies that are faſtened upon ſome of the Apoſtles, they are juſtly cenſured as ſuppoſititious. Let this
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:48709:290"/>
then ſtop the mouth of ſuch cavillers, as aske, Why is not the Croſſe and other Ceremonies ſtill uſed? Why not the ſame form of Prayer? For hereby the true Religion is not altered at all. Now the reaſon why ſuch <hi>inconſtancy</hi> muſt needs be a reproach to Miniſters, is becauſe hereby it is plainly diſcovered, that they are not guided by the Spirit of God after his Word; for the Word is the ſame, and the Spirit of God is alwayes like it ſelf. When therefore men preach contrary Doctrines, we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, theſe are not in both guided by the Spirit of God, but that they are carried away according to the imaginations of their owne heart. When therefore men do not appeare as coming from God, nor as having Commiſſion from him, all that they ſay is eaſily rejected: They ſee no more than of a mutable changeable man in them. <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten commend his Office with this character, that it is of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>not of man;</hi> whereas if thy adminiſtration be of man, and not of God, it will not bring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or majeſty with it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It is not onely thus a reproach, but alſo it rendereth a man uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, it hindereth that other good and truth, which may be in him.</hi> Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Luther,</hi> that he was convinced about his errour of <hi>Conſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but yet thought it not wiſdome to publiſh his recantation, leſt all his other Doctrine ſhould be likewiſe called into queſtion. Certainly that was more carnal policy, than Scripture-wiſdome, if it be a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. However there is thus much truth may be deduced from it, That inconſtancy in ſome truths, though of never ſo ſmall concernment, is enough to bring all under examination. Yet the people of God they are alwayes to remember this Caution, that they labour for the full aſſurance of Gods truth ſo upon their own hearts, that though they ſee many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters alter and change, that they may remain immoveable. It hath been a ſaying, <hi>Optima fides laicorum.</hi> And we reade of a Martyr, though a woman, who being converted from Popery by a Miniſter, but revolting and denying the truth afterwards; when this example was brought to her, to make her change alſo, ſhe replied; no, for now ſhe believed the truth, not becauſe that Miniſter ſaid it, but becauſe Gods Word did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it.</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Laſtly, Here is the <hi>Predicate,</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> affirmed of this object matter thus preached, was not <hi>Yea and Nay, but in him was yea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all theſe parts we may find excellent ſubſtantial matter; but I ſhall be the briefer in ſome of the Doctrines, becauſe I have handled them upon other occaſions.</p>
               <p>Let us beginne with the <hi>Object Matter,</hi> the <hi>Sonne of God Jeſus Chriſt, was preached.</hi> By <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſome here underſtand the Doctrine of Chriſt, and give a Canon or Rule for interpreting <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſometimes by Chriſt we muſt underſtand his Doctrine: ſo <hi>Epheſ. 4. But ye have not ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt.</hi> In like manner ſome expound that place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 8. which is parallel to the Text, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> that is, the Doctrine of Chriſt. We may underſtand both, Chriſt and the Doctrine of Chriſt: the one is preached, <hi>ut quod;</hi> the other, <hi>ut quo</hi> (as they ſay.) Indeed ſome Expoſitors doe not make this an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Object Matter, but <hi>à pari,</hi> or <hi>majori;</hi> if Chriſt Jeſus was not unfaithfull, was not uncertain and inconſtant; but whatſoever he promiſed, he made good; then neither are we his Miniſters, who are depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:48709:291"/>
to this Office by him. But I rather go the former way propoſed, and then the firſt Doctrine is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Chriſt onely is to be the ſubject of all our preaching.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt only is to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our preaching.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle argueth his Doctrine was alwayes the ſame, and uniforme; becauſe Chriſt is ſo, he never altered and changed, now he preached one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As therefore the ſubject of the whole Scripture is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> The whole Word of God tends to the exalting of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So it ought to be with us the Miniſters of the Word. As Chriſt is in himſelf the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi> ſo he ſhould be in our whole Miniſtry: him whom God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to exalt, we ſhould alſo magnifie. And to let you know, that you doe not underſtand any thing rightly, till it bring you to Chriſt, there is no truth, that you are ſimply to ſtay in; but you are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this ſtreame, till it empty it ſelfe into the Ocean, which is Chriſt. When we preach of Faith, of Repentance, of a godly life, theſe are but the ladders (as it were) to tread upon, that you may lay hold on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To enlarge this truth, we muſt take notice <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>when Chriſt is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">When is Chriſt preached.</note> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When we declare that Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>who was crucified at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem <note place="margin">1. When he is declared to be the Meſſiah.</note> 
                  <hi>is the promiſed</hi> Meſſiah, <hi>that he is the Perſon, in whom all thoſe glorious Prophecies that are mentioned in the Prophets, are exactly fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> This is indeed the Fundamental Article, upon which all the other Doctrines about Chriſt do depend. For if that individual perſon be not the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> then doe we in vaine preach him to be the Mediatour, and the Saviour. Now this preaching of Chriſt is the more neceſſary, becauſe of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that are deſperate enemies to our Chriſtianity, expecting another <hi>Meſſias,</hi> judging our Chriſt to be an Impoſtor, and that he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly died, upon the Law made againſt falſe Prophets and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. So that this was a great part of <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching, to prove, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed for the <hi>Jewes,</hi> being pre-poſſeſſed with falſe principles about a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> expecting he ſhould come like a temporall Prince, to worke externall deliverance for them, the more difficult was it to perſwade them of this truth. And for this ground it is, that we have the Scripture attributing ſo much to the believing of this truth, <hi>He that believeth Jeſus is the Christ, is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 15. <hi>Whoſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that Jeſus is the Sonne of God, dwelleth in him, and he in God.</hi> Hence alſo it is, that our Saviour enquired about this faith ſo much, when any came to him, <hi>If they did believe he was the Sonne of God; If they did believe he was able to doe what they deſired.</hi> The Papiſts indeed would from hence inferre, That there is no ſuch thing required in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as by a <hi>ſpecial Faith</hi> to appropriate Chriſt to our ſelves, to be mine and thy Saviour; becauſe this general faith will ſuffice (ſay they) and Chriſt required no more than to acknowledge he was the Saviour ſent of God into the world to heale ſinners; but this doth not exclude <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, ſpecial faith.</hi> Onely the great reaſon, why they were required to make a confeſſion of that dogmatical truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he was the Meſſias,</hi> was, becauſe that was the thing ſo greatly controverted at that time; if that were believed, all the reſt would be quickly aſſented unto. So that this is the introductory worke, with this we are to beginne, <hi>That the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus crucified at Jeruſalem is the Meſſias promiſed;</hi> and that it is in vain to look for any other, ſeeing that all the characters of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> given by the Prophets, doe ſo exactly andually meet in him. And as
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:48709:292"/>
for that great Objection, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> have, The temporal glorious things attributed to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> were not accompliſhed in Chriſt. The weight of which ſeemeth ſo heavy, that ſome expect a ſecond coming of Chriſt, when he will perſonally reigne in a glorious manner upon the earth, and then thoſe promiſes will be fulfilled. But the moſt proper and ſolid Anſwer is, That as the Old Teſtament doth deſcribe Goſpel-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip under the Names and Titles of the Levitical ſervice; ſo it doth alſo declare ſpiritual and Goſpel-priviledges, under the names of earthly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Neither is this any wonder, ſeeing even the New Teſtament de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the joy and glory of Heaven, by that which is glorious and pleaſing to our ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt is to be preached as God and man, for ſo both his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. When prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as God-man.</note> 
                  <hi>are here mentioned.</hi> Wonderfull hath been the violence of the Devil, in raiſing up curſed Hereticks, who have with all their might endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſ-robe him of either of his Natures. Some, and they quickly filled the whole world, denied the Divine Nature of Chriſt; others, though not ſo numerous, they denied his Humane Nature. Which opinions, though ſo abominable, and very deſtructive of the Fundamentals, yet found many gates and doores ſet open for their entertainment. But if he be not preached as <hi>God-man,</hi> as <hi>Emanuel,</hi> as the <hi>Word made fleſh,</hi> then alſo our faith and conſolation is wholly deſtroyed. In the union of theſe two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is founded that aptneſſe and fitneſſe which is in him to be our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour: No meer creature could be a Mediatour, no not the higheſt and ſublimeſt Angel. He muſt be man, becauſe man had ſinned, becauſe the curſe of death muſt be removed by death. And he muſt be God alſo, elſe he could not ſatisfie Juſtice, nor remove the curſe of the Law. It is true, God and man united together in one Perſon, is a wonder of wonders, there is not the like, nor an example thereof in all the world. Divines doe bring many inſtances to illuſtrate it, but none are perfect: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if there were the like, then it would not be ſingular. Now though Chriſt be thus often preached amongſt us, How great is the ignorance of many people in this particular? Aske them, <hi>What was Chriſt?</hi> They will ſay, a <hi>Saviour,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing; but to give any underſtanding account about his God-head and Man-hood, therein they faile exceedingly. How canſt thou be ſaved that knoweſt not what Chriſt was? Though it hath been a thouſand times preached in thy eares, That Chriſt is God from all eternity, and that in time he became man, to die for our ſinnes, yet thou remaineſt as ignorant, as if thou hadſt lived amongſt <hi>Pagans,</hi> where the Name of Chriſt is not heard. But let the true believer be daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing himſelf upon this myſtery of Godlineſſe, which the Apoſtle in a moſt compendious manner doth deſcribe, 1 <hi>Timothy 3. 16. God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Neither is this ſpeculatively to be believed, but it is to advance godlineſſe; and therefore called the <hi>myſtery of godlineſſe.</hi> For what holineſſe, what love, what thankfulneſſe, what reformation ſhould this make, in that God is made man?
<q>
                     <l>Cur Deus fit homo, ſi non corrigitur home?</l>
                  </q>
Therefore the <hi>Socinian,</hi> that denieth the God-head of Chriſt, taketh away that great incentive to godlineſſe, which the Scripture urgeth from Gods mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt is to be preached in his Perſon and Offices, as well as his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. When prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in his perſon and his offices.</note>

<pb n="559" facs="tcp:48709:292"/>
an individual, humane Nature, and yet not have a perſonal ſubſiſtency compleat of it ſelf, which yet it hath not in Chriſt; for then Chriſt would be two Perſons, one as God, and another as man, which is abſurd to think. It is well called <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> becauſe in this the underſtanding of a man muſt only acquieſce upon the teſtimony of the Scripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Chriſt was made like us in all things, ſinne onely excepted;</hi> we may alſo adde the manner of his humane ſubſiſtency, which is not as in other men: but his Office that is to be celebrated with great joy. How were the Angels affected with this, though they did not immediately reape the benefit by his death? Now this Office of Chriſt is made by Divines three-fold, a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and a <hi>King;</hi> the ſumme of it conſiſteth in being a Saviour and a Redeemer from all our ſins, both in reſpect of the guilt of them, as alſo the power of them. It is woe with the Church, when Chriſt is not thus preached the alone Saviour, the alone Mediatour. Now how abominably derogatory the Popiſh preaching in many ages hath been to Chriſt herein, the world knoweth: Inſomuch that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Francis,</hi> or S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Dominick,</hi> or the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or ſome other Saint, theſe were preached more than Chriſt. Inſomuch that we may ſay, Till God raiſed up our Reformers, there was no preaching of Chriſt: Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Saints, Pilgrimages, and workes of Supererogations, theſe were made the whole of Chriſtianity. It is true, they would ſometimes mention Chriſt, but then they make him but a <hi>ſemi-Saviour;</hi> they make others to joyne in this worke. And although they runne to many plauſible diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; yea would perſwade us, that they more honour Chriſt, then we doe; yet all the water of their <hi>Tyber,</hi> cannot cleanſe them herein. It was then bleſſed mercy, when the Sunne-ſhine of the Goſpel began to ariſe; ſo that Chriſt was exalted in his Glory and his Offices; that now there was no more robbery, making others equal to him. Yea the bold blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming picture, was not aſhamed of this Inſcription, <hi>That the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Francis, <hi>was eaſier than by Chriſt.</hi> The Papiſts then do not preach Chriſt. And as for the <hi>Socinian,</hi> he ſurpaſſeth the Papiſt, and deferveth not to be reckoned amongſt Chriſtians. For although they hold him to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted God; and ſome of them ſay, <hi>That religious adoration is due to him:</hi> yet they ſay, <hi>This is meerly from Gods appointment.</hi> Hence as they diſ-robe him of his Deity, ſo they deny him to be a Saviour and Redeemer, by way of ſatisfaction and atonement to the juſtice of God, and therefore make him but as an eminent Prophet and Martyr, but having no eſſential God-head, nor procuring by his death any atonement for our ſinnes to the vindicative juſtice of God. What cauſe then have we to rejoyce under the full and exact preaching of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Natures, in his Offices is ſo magnified, that he alone is to be our Mediatour? In his obedience alone, in his death alone we put all our confidence. For if <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not known as the way, truth and life: If the <hi>Natures</hi> and <hi>Offices of Chriſt</hi> be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, all the way of conſolation, of juſtification, of remiſſion of ſinne, is wholly miſtaken. Becauſe Chriſt is not known in his Mediatory Office, therefore men either runne into deſpair and tormenting fears on one ſide, or elſe into inſtituted wayes of ſuperſtition and ſupererrogation; to the workes of the Law; and to merits, which hath been the poiſonous Doctrine in Gods Church for many yeares together, this was the wormwood that was in all their water. The <hi>Popiſh Caſuiſts</hi> did give conſciences troubled for ſinne, nothing but gall to drink; and in ſtead of healing did provoke and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the wound farre more. <note place="margin">5. When he is ſet up as the head of his Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Chriſt is preached, when he is ſet up as the King and Lord of his Church, to whoſe Lawes and commands we are wholly to ſubmit, elſe we

ſhall hereafter finde him to be the great Judge of the world, who will judge it in righteouſneſſe.</hi> People are deceived, when they think Chriſt muſt be preached onely as a meer abſolute Saviour, that though they live in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe and diſſoluteneſſe, yet they are to truſt in him as a Saviour. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever preacheth Chriſt thus, he preacheth another Chriſt than what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Word. Therefore the Doctrines of <hi>Antinomians</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, who turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe,</hi> are to be abhorred with all abomination; though there may be a ſinfull ſetting up of righteouſneſs, and our good workes againſt Chriſt and his grace; ſo there may be alſo a licentious conjoyning Chriſt and wickedneſſe. We muſt therefore diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of what perſons we have to do with. For, as <hi>Luther</hi> obſerved well to this effect, <hi>(Comment. in Gen.) The Antinomians, who cry down holineſſe and mortification, they maintain themſelves by my words and doctrin which I have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; but they muſt remember, that when we came out of Popery, we found the whole world in phariſaical admiration of ſuperſtitious workes, as if by them they ſhould be juſtified and ſaved, which made us ſo advance Chriſt. But under this pretence to cry down the preaching of the Law, to give way to all licentiouſneſſe;</hi> as if a Publican living in his ſinnes might be ſaved by Chriſt, though not a Phariſee: This is to ſeparate one Scripture from another.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>If we are onely to preach Chriſt, then we muſt not preach the Law, we muſt not preach about regeneration, and the differencing chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters between a temporary believer, and a true one: we muſt not then preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, holy duties, nor the day of Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it is anſwered, <hi>That the right preaching of all theſe, is to preach Chriſt.</hi> Therefore the Law is preached, hell and damnation are preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo Chriſt may be the more welcome, that ſo the grace of the Goſpel may be the more conſpicuous. Even as it is with the Phyſician, it's health that he aimeth at, even while he maketh ſick, while he putteth to paine, and ſeemeth to take the ready way to deſtroy and kill. The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, while he ploweth and harroweth the ground, it is the crop he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at in all this: So it is with the Miniſters of God, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, threaten, terrifie; while they informe, direct; all is to bring you nearer to Chriſt; Theſe are the Ladders to ſtand upon, while Chriſt is built in you.</p>

               <p>VVE heard what was the Subject matter of <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching, even the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> who is deſcribed from his Natures, and Office.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>His Divine Nature,</hi> in the former words, <hi>The Son of God.</hi> What is neceſſary for the Explication of this, ſhall be brought in the Amplification of the Doctrine; which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> The Lord Chriſt is the Son of God.</p>
               <p>This is the greateſt and moſt glorious Attribute that can be given to him. It <note place="margin">The Lord Chriſt is the ſon of God.</note> is for this that all adoration and divine worſhip is due to him. It is for this that we are commanded to put our truſt and confidence in him. Had he not been truly God, he could not have been our Mediator, nor purchaſed our Salvation for us. No meer, pure creature, Man or Angel, could accompliſh this work, but he that is our Saviour muſt be <hi>Immanuel, God with us.</hi> I ſhall not inlarge my ſelf, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignity of this Subject, but briefly diſpatch all I ſhall ſay at this time. And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When we ſay, He is the Son of God; the meaning is, ſo that he is truely and properly of the ſame Nature with God.</hi> It is not to be underſtood diminitively, <note place="margin">1. He is truly God.</note> as if he were not the moſt <hi>High God,</hi> and <hi>Jehovah;</hi> but diſtinctively, in reſpect of the <hi>Father,</hi> he is the <hi>Son of the Father;</hi> ſo that, he hath the true nature with God, though not the ſame perſonal propriety with the Father. As then he is called the <hi>Son of man,</hi> becauſe he hath the ſame nature of a man, ſo alſo the <hi>Son of God,</hi> becauſe he hath the true nature of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. called <hi>God, bleſſed for evermore.</hi> And indeed, he that hath the Titles of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Properties of <hi>Jevovah,</hi> that doth thoſe works only which <hi>Jehovah</hi> can do, he muſt needs be ſo the <hi>Son of God;</hi> that alſo he is God himſelf. And had not Chriſt been truly God, it be hoved him to have denyed it, when it was attributed to him. But, <hi>Phil. 2. He thought it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Such was Chriſts Humility, ſuch was his love to his Fathers glory; ſuch was his care to inſtruct his Diſciples in that which was neceſſary to Salvation, that above all things he would have forewarned them, not to have taken him for the true High God, if he had not been ſo. How ſolicitous was <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> that he might not be thought the <hi>Chriſt?</hi> How paſſionately affected were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when the Heathens called them Gods, and would have attributed divine worſhip to him? Would not Chriſt have much more diſclaimed theſe things, had it not been his due belonging to him? That he ſhould be acknowledged <hi>the true God, equal with the Father.</hi> For, though indeed, at ſometimes he ſaith, <hi>The Father is greater than I,</hi> and he maketh himſelf as <hi>ſent</hi> from God, to do his will; yet, then he ſpeaks that in reſpect of his Office, as Mediator; and ſo he is the Servant of God, appointed to do his will, in reference to the Salvation of Mankinde.</p>

As for that Paſſage in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 3. where the Angel ſpeaking of the overſhadowing by the Holy Ghoſt, addeth, <hi>Therefore alſo, that holy thing, which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God:</hi> which hath prevailed with ſome, though Orthodox, ſo far, as to make that miraculous birth a ground of his Sonſhip to God.

It is neceſſary then to inform your ſelves in this fundamental Article, that Chriſt is <hi>the Son of God;</hi> and in what ſenſe he is ſo.

How many Hereticks blaſphemouſly have derided at this, becauſe we ſay, <hi>God had a Son,</hi> and that he is <hi>begotten</hi> of the Father? But we muſt know, there is a threefold <hi>Generation.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Phyſical,</hi> of man begetting a man, and this is accompliſhed with manifold Imperfections. 2. <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> in which ſenſe Philoſophers do often ſpeak of the <hi>Conceptus mentis,</hi> that the minde doth <hi>degignere verbum;</hi> which inſtance ſome learned Divines delight to uſe in the Illuſtration of this Myſterious point. 3.

Father; ſo that, although the Son hath the ſame ſpecifical Eſſence with the Father, yet not the ſame numerical Eſſence: whereas in this ſupernatural Myſtery, there is no diviſion, or diſtinction of the Eſſence, but of the Perſon.</p>

That place alſo of <hi>John,</hi> howſoever <hi>Socinians</hi> would wreſt it, ſtands like Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> yea firmer than that, 1 <hi>John 5. 7. There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> When a man taketh off his heart from the Scripture, and beginneth to think, How can the Infinite Majeſty of God have a <hi>Son,</hi> how can he have the ſame Eſſence, and yet be a diſtinct Perſon, whether did he beget this Son naturally or freely, whether from Eternity or in time; and if he might beget one Son, why not more? while (I ſay) thy Imperfect low Soul is arguing after this matter, fly from theſe temptations of Reaſon, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> from his Miſtreſs; captivate thy underſtanding to Scripture-teſtimony, hide thy head in this cloud, as it were, and put off thy diſcuſſion of it, till thou come to that perfect Academy in heaven, where we ſhall no longer know in part, but compleatly and perfectly. Hence thoſe Hereticks, who deny Chriſts his Godhead, that they may the more ſecurely indulge themelves in theſe Blaſphemous Doctrines, make Reaſon the Judg of all Controverſies in Faith, The Scripture muſt be ſubmitted to reaſon, not Reaſon to Scripture. This Reaſon is made the ſtandard to weigh all things by. But <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid well, <hi>quid tum contra rationem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What is ſo much againſt Reaſon, as to think to comprehend by reaſon the things above reaſon?</hi> Such <hi>Pigmeis</hi> cannot meaſure the <hi>Pyramides.</hi> Yet this is not ſpoken as if that it were againſt true and ſolid Reaſon, that the Infinite God ſhould have a Son: it is one thing, to be <hi>above Reaſon,</hi> another thing to be <hi>contrary to it.</hi> Now the cauſe of all that unhappy miſcarriage in this matter is, becauſe we are apt to judg of God, according to our thoughts of a man. When we hear of the Father, and his only begotten Son, we are apt to think it muſt be ſo in the Divine nature, as it is with the humane: we apprehend all alike. But thou muſt know, as the nature of God is incomprehenſible, ſo is this begetting of his Son. Thou that art not able to comprehend the nature of God, how canſt thou reach to the manner of the Begetting of his Son? Let us therefore ſatisfie our ſouls with the belief that it is ſo, not daring curiouſly to ſearch into the manner how, leſt like moaths flying about this light, we be at laſt conſumed by it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That we may the more firmly believe this truth of Chriſts being the Son of</hi>

                  <hi>God, we are to remember, that the Scripture maketh this Antichriſtianiſm; So that, he is an Antichriſt, that denyeth the Son to be God,</hi> 1 John 2. 22, 23. <hi>He is Antichriſt that ſhall deny the father, and the ſon. Whoſoever denyeth the Son, the ſame hath not the father.</hi> Here we ſee, that theſe are inſeparable, the Son and the Father; he that denieth the one, muſt neceſſarily deny the other; for they are eſſential Relatives, depending upon one another. The <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Turks,</hi> they hold one God; but becauſe they deny Chriſt to be the Son of God, they deny the Father. It is not enough to acknowledg one true God, but we muſt alſo acknowledg him to be the Father of Chriſt, and Chriſt to be his Son: without this there is no Eternal life to be had, as 1 <hi>John 5. 20. We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; This is the true God, this is Eternallife.</hi> The <hi>Socinians</hi> alſo differ but gradually in their impiety from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:48709:295"/>
therefore, no wonder if ſome of them have fallen into <hi>Mahumetiſme;</hi> for they make Chriſt to be a meer man, though a conſtituted Lord and God; and therefore they deny the Father and the Son: and although they pretend it is their conſcience, that out of reverence and regard to the honor of God the Father, they dare not affirm the Son to be equal God with him, yet it is plain, that there is no jealouſie between Father and Son in point of honor; but the Father commands us to honour the Son, and the Son alſo to honour the Father. For, how clear is that? <hi>John 5. 23. That all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father.</hi> And therefore all thoſe Blaſphemous Doctrines, which tend to the Diſhonour of Chriſt, as the Son of God, do alſo tend to the diſhonour of God the Father. So that, it is no wonder if he be made an Antichriſt, that doth ſo. For their is a <hi>political Antichriſt,</hi> who oppoſeth Chriſt in his Offices, and while pretending to Chriſt, doth oppoſe Chriſt: ſuch is the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> and a <hi>Doctrinal Antichriſt:</hi> and they are thoſe who deny Chriſt, either to be God or man. When therefore you hear how much this peſtilential Doctrine of <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> prevaileth, that men dare boldly plead againſt the Godhead of Chriſt, tremble at it, humble thy ſelf under the want of love to the truths of God; take heed of pride, ſelf-conceit, contempt of the faithfull Guides God hath ſet over thee; for thoſe ſinnes do hurry men headlong into everlaſting Perdition: thoſe ſpiritual Judgments of God upon mens parts, and intellectual abilities are the moſt dreadfull of all.</p>

                  <hi>denied this eſſential Deity of Chriſt;</hi> inſomuch that one party will not acknowledg the other Chriſtian. For ſome of them hold, that becauſe Chriſt is not truly God, therefore he is not to be praid unto; neither doth Religious Adoration belong to him. The other, they affirm, becauſe he is an <hi>appointed Lord</hi> over the whole world; and ſo, though not a God by nature, yet by Office: and ſeing that the Father hath given him the Dominion of the world; therefore Prayer, and all Divine Worſhip is to be attributed unto him. <hi>Volkelius</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> handling this Queſtion, <hi>de ver â Relig.</hi> lib. 4. c. 11. Whether it be lawfull to pray to Chriſt, declareth his minde, in two Aſſertions. 1. <hi>That we may lawfully pray unto Chriſt alwayes.</hi> And 2. <hi>That we are not alwayes bound to it:</hi> yet addeth, that <hi>we might deſervedly be thought not worthy of the Chriſtian Name, if we ſhould refuſe to call upon him.</hi> But all this is meer impiety; for it is impoſſible to call upon God the Father, and not alſo to call upon Chriſt: and when one Perſon is prayed unto, the other is not neglected, but included. And therefore, how thoſe <hi>Socinians</hi> by their Principles can maintain the Religious Adoration of Chriſt, againſt <hi>Franciſcus David,</hi> let them look to it.</p>
               <p>Let us proceed to make Uſe of this. Is Chriſt the Son of God? Then with the Scripture let us admire that Love and condeſcenſion of the Father, who ſent his only Son to become a moſt ignominious and accurſed man for our ſakes. The Myſtery of the Doctrine, and the Myſtery of his love are both incomprehenſible: the one is above our underſtanding, the other above our affections. What may not God exſpect from us, who hath done ſo much to us? God made man, God made weak, miſerable, and crucified man, to redeem us from our ſinnes. What ſtrong Obligations doth this lay upon us, to make us for ever to abhor all ſin? All the Arguments of moral Philoſophers againſt ſin, are but like a wooden dagger to this <hi>Goliahs</hi> Sword. Here is fire enough to melt the tougheſt iron. Was God made man to remove ſin, and ſhall thou yield thy ſelf up to it? What remedy will prevail if this do not?</p>

               <p>VVE have in a brief manner declared the former deſcription of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>divine nature, The Son of God;</hi> whoſe Deity, ſo much oppugned by blaſphemous Heretiques, is yet the Foundation of our Chriſtianity. Therefore, thoſe <hi>Socinians,</hi> who would reckon the manner how he is God, among the Acceſſories, and not Fundamentals in Religion, are juſtly to be exploded. <hi>If we believe he is God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>it is enough to ſalvation: but, whether he be an eſſential God, or made and conſtituted one, that is not neceſſary.</hi> Even as (they inſtance prophanely concerning <hi>Alexander)</hi> to ſome he was accounted a God, to others a man: but becauſe both theſe, though different in their Opinions, did reverence and obey him, as a King, that was enough. But, oh prophane mouth! The Lord rebuke ſuch ſpirits, and let not the Godly ſo much as bid <hi>God ſpeed,</hi> or receive into their houſes ſuch as bring this blaſphemous Doctrine. But let us proceed to the other deſcriptions of Chriſt, which are partly in reſpect of his <hi>Humane Nature, Jeſus;</hi> and partly, in reſpect of his Office, <hi>Christ.</hi> We have already ſaid enough from the firſt Verſe, to clear the Grammatical Interpretation of theſe words; as alſo, what the judgments of Learned men are about thoſe two Names: So that I may not <hi>actum agere,</hi> I ſhall inſiſt upon New matter, not then delivered, and firſt we Obſerve.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Chriſt is a Saviour to his people.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This Name containeth the glad Tydings of the Goſpel. If ſo be the news of a Phyſician, that can cure all Diſeaſes be ſo welcome to diſeaſed Perſons: if the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> was ſo acceptable to all thoſe whoſe Lands were morgaged amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they perplexed in extream Debts: how precious and dear ſhould the name of a Saviour be to poor undone ſinners, who while they look upon themſelves only, and their own power, ſee no way to eſcape Eternal wrath? Did the Angels ſo much rejoyce, when this <hi>Jeſus</hi> came into the World, who were not concerned ſo much in his Redemption? and ſhall diſtreſſed and ſinfull man not have his heart leap within him, for joy hereat? That we may be affected <note place="margin">What is implyed in Chriſts being a Saviour. 1. That all mankinde was loſt.</note> herein, let us conſider, what is implyed in this Title, He is a <hi>Saviour. 2. Of whom he is a Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In that Chriſt is thus called a Saviour, their is neceſſarily implyed, that all mankinde are loſt, that we are all in an undone and hopeleſs condition.</hi> Thus our Saviour, <hi>Mat, 18. 11. For the ſon of man is come to ſave that which is loſt.</hi> What bleſſed words of comfort are here! <hi>He is come to ſave;</hi> it is of his own accord, of his own good will he cometh; there is no neceſſity, he might have choſen whether he would or no; but, of his own meer will, <hi>he is come:</hi> and then he <hi>is
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:48709:296"/>
come to ſave:</hi> that implyeth, this is the work, he had no other thing to do: if man had not been loſt, he had not come into the world. If then it be Chriſts proper work and Office to ſave, ſhall we think, he will be fruſtrated therein? and then it is to <hi>ſave,</hi> in that it comprehended all things. He came to convert, to ſanctifie, to juſtifie, to glorifie; for Salvation includeth all theſe. Hence the Scripture ſpeaketh of the Godly, as <hi>ſaved</hi> already, though but in the way, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. who hath ſaved us, and called us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, He came <hi>to ſave that, which was loſt,</hi> actually loſt, not in danger to be loſt, not in probability to be <hi>loſt;</hi> but <hi>loſt;</hi> and then <hi>loſt;</hi> that doth imply our hopeleſs eſtate. Its grace muſt finde us out, its Chriſt that muſt ſeek us out; as the good Shepherd did his wandring ſheep. So that we ſee in what condition every man is, though never ſo great, wiſe, and learned, till he hath an Intereſt in Chriſt; though a Great man, a <hi>loſt</hi> man; though a Rich man, yet a <hi>loſt</hi> man, and that to all Eternity, for ever <hi>loſt,</hi> till this Saviour doth recover. What then haſt thou to do, but to ſit down, and bewail thy loſs? to aggravate thy loſs? Oh wretched and undone man, <hi>I have loſt God, I have loſt his image, I have lost Eternal glory.</hi> Is it not a reproach to thee, to ſee how thy heart can mourn, and mert, for outward loſſes? I have loſt my dear Relations, I have loſt all I am worth; and to have it like a ſtone and a rock, in this particular? It is one thing to be loſt, and another thing to be ſenſible of this. All men by nature are loſt, though they do not feel it, though they rejoyce, and are carnally jolly: but then, ſome few only, whoſe hearts God doth ſoften by his Grace, they feel, and groan under this loſt eſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We are to conſider, what kinde of Saviour he his, and what kinde of Salvation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. What kinde of Saviour is Chriſt? Even a ſpiritual one.</note> 
                  <hi>it is:</hi> And now that is plain, he is not a <hi>temporal Saviour, but a ſpiritual one.</hi> ſo the <hi>Angel</hi> interpreteth it, for <hi>he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes,</hi> Mat. 17. 21. In the Old Teſtament we read, that God did raiſe up his people many temporal Saviours. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Saviour, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who hath the ſame name with <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he was a Saviour: and the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> maketh <hi>Joſhua</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nun,</hi> delivering the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their dangers and enemies, ſo that at laſt, he bringeth them into the Land of Reſt; to be a Type of Chriſt, our <hi>ſpiritual Saviour,</hi> who delivereth us from all our <hi>ſpiritual enemies,</hi> ſin, and Satan, not leaving us, till he hath made us ſit on Thrones of Glory. Now this carnal Opinion, that Chriſt would come as a <hi>temporal</hi> Saviour, did almoſt infect the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> yea the Diſciples were leavened with this ſower leaven. And becauſe ſome places of Scripture did plainly ſpeak of the lowlineſs and afflictions of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and other of his glory and greatneſs, therefore ſome <hi>Jews</hi> fancyed two <hi>Meſſiahs,</hi> one humble, lowly, and poor, the other magnificent and glorious. And certainly, if Chriſt had come as a <hi>temporal Meſſias,</hi> to vindicate his people from all external bondage, and to beſtow on them outward pomp, and greatneſs, this world would have ſuited with fleſh and bloud; but it is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Salvation he bringeth; and though natural men do not think ſo, yet this is the greateſt Salvation, this alone deſerveth to be called <hi>Salvation: To be ſaved from thy ſinnes, to be ſaved from hell, to be ſaved from damnation.</hi> This is that which alone makes happy. The <hi>Romans</hi> they ſacrificed to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as their Saviour, and that was only for temporal Deliverances. But with what praiſe and joy are we to acknowledg Chriſt our Saviour, who doth thus vanquiſh our moſt potent and ſpiritual enemies? But no hearer can reliſh this truth, unleſs he be ſpiritual; he muſt be like the man of <hi>Jericho,</hi> wounded not in body, but in ſoul, crying out, I am not a dead man, but a damned man, that deſireth this oyl to be poured into his wounds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>As it is a ſpiritual Salvation, ſo it is an efficacious, full ſalvation.</hi> Hence <note place="margin">3. He is an effectual Saviour.</note> he is called <gap reason="foreign">

him,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. He is not an half ſaviour, he doth not ſave in part. It is true, this <hi>ſalvation</hi> is not in one inſtant perfected, it is done by degrees; the Lord doth not perfectly ſave us from the ſpot and blemiſh of our ſinnes. There is the guilt of ſin, the power of ſin, the filth of ſin. Now, even in this life, <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth ſave us perfectly from the guilt of ſin; ſo that, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> as alſo from the power of ſin he delivereth us ſo, that <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over us, becauſe we are under grace:</hi> only for the preſence of ſin, and the luſts thereof, exciting and tempting; theſe are left as the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> in the land. <hi>Chriſt</hi> could perfect his Salvation in one inſtant, but for wiſe ends, he doth it by degrees. With him it is eaſie to ſave, there is no difficulty in it. Indeed this <hi>ſalvation</hi> is purchaſed upon hard termes; he was willing to be in thoſe Agonies, and conflicts, he was willing to dy that ignominous death, that we might be ſaved, ſo that, he himſelf ſeemed to be loſt a while, that he might ſave us; otherwiſe, by his death he hath obtained a plentifull Salvation. There are no ſinnes too many, or too great, from which he cannot ſave. It is true, we meet with an expreſſion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 18. That <hi>the righteous are ſcarcely ſaved;</hi> which ſome indeed apply to a temporal deliverance, that they do hardly eſcape outward afflictions; for the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had formerly ſpoken that <hi>Judgment must begin at the houſe of God.</hi> But if we apply it to the <hi>ſpiritual Salvation</hi> of a godly man, then it is true, even <hi>a godly man is ſcarcely ſaved.</hi> Not, that there is want, or any defect in Chriſt; not that his blood can difficulty do it, but, becauſe the way to Salvation is ſo ſtraight a way, ſo contrary to fleſh and blood, and the Oppoſitions are ſo many, to retard, and divert, that therefore he is hardly ſaved. Were it not for the preſerving Grace of God keeping of us, when we do not keep our ſelves, it is impoſſible, that the moſt holy man ſhould be ſaved. Yet, if we conſider Chriſt himſelf, the <hi>Saviour,</hi> the godly ſoul may take ſo much encouragement from his Fulneſs; and ſee more in him to ſave, then can be with his ſinnes, (yea, if all the ſinnes of the world were likewiſe upon his ſcore,) to condemn and deſtroy him.</p>
               <p>In the next place, let us conſider, <hi>Who they are, to whom he is a ſaviour.</hi> For, <note place="margin">Who is Chriſt a Saviour to?</note> though he be a <hi>ſaviour,</hi> yet it is not of all men; the greater part, not only of mankinde in the general, but of ſuch as are within the Church, will be damned. Therefore the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth mankinde into two ſorts of perſons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: ſuch as are to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and ſuch as are to <hi>periſh.</hi> not that this doth redound to the blame of any Decrees of God, about the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of ſome men only, or to the particularity of Chriſts death; as if ſome had a deſire, and would have been ſaved, but Chriſt would not ſave them; but becauſe, in the men to periſh, their own ſinnes do indiſpoſe them for <hi>ſalvation,</hi> and they do wilfully and obſtinately thruſt it away far from them. And then the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they are ſuch, who by the meer grace of God are <hi>ſaved</hi> from Hell, that would have been damned as well as others; only the Grace of God did from the firſt to the laſt preſerve them for this Bleſſedneſs. In this ſenſe it is, <hi>Act. 2. 47. The Lord added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> Not that this word denoteth a preſent Diſpoſition, where by a man doth eſcape the ſinnes of the world, (though all that are ſaved ſhall do that,) but the mercifull Grace of God pulling them out, as he did <hi>Lot</hi> from <hi>Sodom;</hi> (for there its ſaid) <hi>When he lingred, the Lord being mercifull to him.</hi> So it is here, we are unwilling to come out of this <hi>Sodom,</hi> unwilling to be delivered from our luſts; and ſo are unwilling to be ſaved. But God being mercifull to us, by his omnipotent power he changeth our hearts, and maketh us, of refractory and unwilling, ready and obedient. Well then, who are theſe ſaved ones? A great Queſtion, and neceſſary. For would it not be more than all the world, to finde thy ſelf one in the number of theſe ſaved ones, when thouſands, and thouſands ſhall periſh in everlaſting flames.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="568" facs="tcp:48709:297"/>
I ſhall not enlarge in this, but give ſome brief Deſcriptions of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It's ſome of mankinde that he cometh to ſave:</hi> not any of the <hi>Apoſtate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Some of mankinde.</note> 
                  <hi>Angels;</hi> which doth infinitely commend the love of this Saviour to loſt man. The Apoſtle taketh notice of this aggravation, <hi>Heb. 2. 16. For verily he took not upon him the nature of Angels.</hi> Who would not have thought, Chriſt would come rather to ſave <hi>loſt</hi> Angels, than <hi>loſt men? Angels</hi> are of more noble and excellent natures than men. <hi>Angels,</hi> if ſaved, would have done God more ſervice, and brought him more glory than men. We ſee, if a learned, if a great man in place and power, be converted, how much he may do for God beyond an inferiour man: and then, much more would a ſaved <hi>Angel</hi> have done, than the moſt able men. Yet ſuch was the love of God, that his only Son muſt come from his boſome, to ſave loſt man.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, It is not all loſt men that he cometh to ſave, <hi>but the humbled ſinner; the repenting and believing ſinner.</hi> He muſt be a <hi>ſinner,</hi> for if he were not <note place="margin">2. The repenting, believing ſinner.</note> ſo, he needed not a <hi>Saviour;</hi> hence he ſaith, <hi>Matth. 9. 13. He came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to Repentance:</hi> that is, either ſuch as thought themſelves righteous, that were preſumptuouſly confident thereof; or elſe, (as others) thoſe that are indeed <hi>righteous,</hi> if any ſuch could be, Chriſt came not to them. Hence this conſideration of being a ſinner is not to diſcourage thee is not to keep thee off from a <hi>ſaviour;</hi> for if thou wert not a ſinner thou didſt not need a <hi>Saviour:</hi> Who ſhould come to a <hi>ſaviour</hi> but a ſinner? to the Phyſician but the ſick? Hence <hi>Paul</hi> comforted himſelf under this, when he had been ſuch a Perſecutor, and Blaſphemer, that <hi>Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, whereof he was chief, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. But I add, it muſt be <hi>the humbled ſinner,</hi> the wounded ſinner, that feeleth himſelf periſhing; as the Diſciples in the waters, feeling themſelves ready to ſink, cryed out, <hi>Maſter, ſave us, we periſh, Matth.</hi> 8. 25. So it muſt be ſuch a broken-hearted ſinner, that feeleth himſelf dropping into Hell, falling into thoſe eternal flames, and therefore cryeth out, <hi>O Lord Chriſt ſave me, elſe I periſh.</hi> We may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. who they are that have the Scepter of Grace held out towards them, and are invited to come into his preſence, even <hi>ſuch as labour, and are heavy laden,</hi> that have no reſt in their ſoules as yet, becauſe of ſin; neither their bids, nor their houſes, neither their gardens, nor their wealth can give them any reſt.</p>
               <p>Hence, in the third place, <hi>They are ſuch as are ſaved already from the evil</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. They are ſaved from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the world.</note> 
                  <hi>and wicked wayes of the world.</hi> There is a twofold <hi>ſalvation;</hi> the one, from <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>damnation:</hi> and many look only upon this as <hi>ſalvation.</hi> But then, there is <hi>a ſalvation from the evil cuſtomes, and wicked wayes of the world:</hi> and he that hath not this <hi>ſalvation</hi> will never have the latter. Therefore <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. when <hi>Peters</hi> hearers were pricked in their heart, (that is a preparatory way to converſion) they asked, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> They would gladly be ſaved from the guilt of theſe ſinnes. Then obſerve, what counſel the Apoſtle giveth, yea, he did it with much exhorting and teſtifying, <hi>v. 40. ſave your ſelves, or be ye ſaved from this untoward generation:</hi> that is, Be not in the number of thoſe that do reſiſt Chriſt; that will not believe his Doctrine, and miracles, but eſcape from them: they are in a dangerous eſtate. Therefore if thou wouldeſt be ſaved hereafter, ſee, Art thou ſaved already? art thou delivered from the number of thoſe wicked and ungodly men who will not obey Chriſt? How greatly would a man roaring in Hell be affected with ſuch mercy, as to be delivered from thoſe torments? But, it is no leſs to be ſaved from thoſe ungodly wayes, thou didſt once live in: to be ſaved from the wicked companions, and the inticements of luſts, that once thou waſt intangled in.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>They who are to be ſaved are Chriſts people</hi> and <hi>none elſe.</hi> Such as take him for a <hi>Lord,</hi> as well as a <hi>ſaviour.</hi> Every wicked wretch loveth to hear, that <note place="margin">4. Chriſts people.</note> Chriſt is a <hi>ſaviour:</hi> but then, if thou enquireſt to whom, this will marr all thy
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:48709:297"/>
hopes; <hi>He will ſave his people from their ſinnes,</hi> Mat. 1. 21. <hi>his people,</hi> that is, ſuch as do accept of him, and receive him, as their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master;</hi> who do cordially ſubmit to his Lawes, and Ordinances. So that, theſe two words, <hi>Chriſts people</hi> do ſhut out a very great part of of the world from this Salvation; they have neither part or lot herein. Is the praphane man one of <hi>Chriſts people?</hi> no, he is one of his enemies, one of his adverſaries; he ſaith, <hi>We will not have Chriſt raign over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>They that are ſaved are very few, comparatively, to thoſe that are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. The ſaved are but few in compariſon of the damned.</note> 
                  <hi>damned. Chriſt,</hi> though he be <hi>a ſufficient ſaviour,</hi> to ſave the whole world, yet he is an <hi>actual efficacious ſaviour</hi> but to few only: therefore, they are called a <hi>little flock.</hi> Hence when one put that Queſtion to our Saviour, <hi>Whether there would but few be ſaved,</hi> Luke 13. 23. Though our Saviour did not directly anſwer him, as proceeding from curioſity, yet he did implicitely reſolve it, when he bid that man <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtraight gate, for many will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> There will be a time, when a <hi>ſaviour</hi> will be in requeſt, though for the preſent we ſeek after other <hi>ſaviours.</hi> But alas, Will thy riches ſave thee? will thy wealth ſave thee at that day? If Chriſt then be a Saviour, and ſalvation is the great end of thy ſoul, to prepare for that ought to be thy greateſt care and delight. Better never have been born, then not to be ſaved hereafter. Oh remember, now is the acceptable time of thy <hi>ſalvation,</hi> now Chriſt proffereth to be a Saviour. In his firſt coming his profeſſion is, that <hi>he came not to judg, but to ſave the world,</hi> John 12. 47. But at his laſt coming, he will then appear, not <hi>to ſave, but to juge the world.</hi> Oh then that men ſhould be ſo beſotted, and bewitched, as to neglect this <hi>ſalvation</hi> offered! Oh what terror will it be, to hear millions of perſons adjudged for their ſinnes to eternal deſtruction! then in horror to cry out, <hi>Oh Chriſt ſave us, Lord ſave us,</hi> but it will be too late.</p>
               <p>The Second Doctrine I ſhall but only name; which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Lord Jeſus is Chriſt; that is, the Meſſias, the anointed one, he is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jeſus is the Chriſt, the anointed of God.</note> 
                  <hi>a Chriſt, that he may be a Jeſus.</hi>

               <p>Now Chriſt is no more then Anointed: and becauſe in the Old Teſtament <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Prophets</hi> were anointed to that Office, and thereby were made ſacred, and inviolable; <hi>Touch not my anointed, and do my Prophets no harm:</hi> hence in alluſion <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>anointed,</hi> not indeed with material oyl, but with the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> which is called the <hi>oyl of gladneſs,</hi> Pſal. 45. 7. And from hence we have our names, <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as much as <hi>anointed ones;</hi> A glorions title implying our participation of Gods Spirit, and his Graces.

               <p>THe next Particular conſiderable is, <hi>The Miniſterial and inſtrumental Cauſe of the preaching of Chriſt:</hi> and there we have three named. The Firſt and principall is, <hi>Paul himſelf.</hi> The other two Colleagues and Aſſociates are, <hi>Sylvanus, and Timotheus. Calvin</hi> propounds the Queſtion, <hi>Why</hi> Apollo <hi>was not named as well as theſe?</hi> and he giveth this Anſwer, <hi>That probably theſe only were charged with the ſame Calumnies that</hi> Paul <hi>was, becauſe they were his Attendants, and Companions in his ſpiritual peregrinations: and therefore he would defend their names as well as his own.</hi> Concerning <hi>Timotheus,</hi> which is <hi>Timothy,</hi> we have ſpoken already from the firſt <hi>verſe.</hi> Only concerning this <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> there is ſome doubt; but the moſt learned do make him to be the ſame with <hi>Sylas,</hi> mentioned often in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> as a companion of <hi>Paul:</hi> hence ſome would expound that Periphraſtical expreſſion, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 18. The brother whoſe praiſe is in the Gospel</hi> of <hi>Sylas,</hi> as not being applicable to <hi>Luke. Sylas</hi> and <hi>Sylvanus</hi> are generally thought to be the ſame name, though ſome would make them two names of one perſon: yea, ſome would make them two diſtinct perſons, which hath no probability. The word cometh from an Hebrew root, which is <hi>to ſend,</hi> and ſo is the ſame with <hi>Apoſtolus,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtle, one that is ſent.</hi> We may read often of this man, as being eminent in the Goſpel-Miniſtry. <hi>Paul</hi> inſcribeth both his Epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> with his name, as well as his own, putting it alſo before <hi>Timotheus.</hi> He with <hi>Barſabas</hi> were choſen by the <hi>Synodat Jeruſalem,</hi> to diſtribute the Apoſtolical letters, having this character, They were <hi>chief among the brethren;</hi> they were in great eminency and eſteem. We read alſo, when there was that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a ſharp contention</hi> between <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> (we ſee the frailties of the beſt in this; for I cannot approve of thoſe that take the word in a good ſenſe, becauſe it is ſo uſed <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24.) that <hi>Paul</hi> choſe <hi>Sylas</hi> to be his companion (and no wonder he nameth him here) in this text; for he was a ſpecial coadjutor to <hi>Paul</hi> in the planting of the Goſpel at <hi>Corinth;</hi> for you may read, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 5. how that, when <hi>Sylas</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> were come to him thither, being afore ſent for by him, it is ſaid, <hi>Paul was preſſed in ſpirit, and teſtified unto the Jews, that Jeſus was Chriſt. Paul</hi> then took more courage, having theſe Companions, and was the more animated to diſcharge his office: ſo that, it was not for modeſty, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hinteth, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth aſſume him to this
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:48709:298"/>
Colleagueſhip, but alſo, becauſe there was need of his help: the harveſt being great at <hi>Corinth,</hi> there needed many labourers: and withall he conjoyneth theſe himſelf, to ſhew the harmony and conſent that was between him and the other Miniſters in preaching of Chriſt. So that from the conjoyning of theſe with <hi>Paul,</hi> there are three Obſervations deduceable, which ſhall be briefly diſpatched at this time. The firſt is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas the Miniſterial labour and work is great, there needeth the more aſſiſtance, and help from others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf alone is not able to do all the work that this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Where Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial labours are great, there needeth the more help from others.</note> doth require, and therefore he calleth in other Labourers to aſſiſt him therein. Hence our Saviour directs us to pray unto God, that where there is work for a Miniſtry, ſuitable Miniſters may be ſent thither, <hi>Matth. 9. 37, 38. The harveſt truly is plenteous, and the labourers are few.</hi> He compareth a people prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by grace for the Miniſtry, to the <hi>harveſt:</hi> now, as it is a high degree of lazineſſe to be idle in harveſt; thus it would be inexcuſable in the Miniſters of God, if they ſhould be loitering and ſluggiſh, when the ſouls of people are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receivd the good meſſage of the Lord. Two things the Scripture taketh notice of in <hi>harveſt;</hi> the <hi>joy of harveſt,</hi> and the <hi>labour in harveſt;</hi> and both theſe are to be ſeen in a people fitted for Miniſterial work, for Inſtruction, for Reformation. There is infinite matter of <hi>joy</hi> to the people, and to the Miniſter: whereas, to meet with a people that are like a field of bryars and thorns, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> did, this is wholly diſcouraging. The people may rejoyce, becauſe God gave them ſuch a willing mind. How many Congregations are there, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called an <hi>harveſt-field,</hi> but a <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> an <hi>heath,</hi> a <hi>dunghill?</hi> Now, it is the meer goodneſſe of God, that maketh ſuch a difference between Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations: ſome are a ſtiff-necked, obdurate, and prophane people: others, a willing, attentive, and a ready people. But God makes Congregations as well as perſons, to differ one from another. Then there is <hi>joy</hi> to a Miniſter; it is comfortable to be plowing and ſowing upon fruitfull ground. What joy is there to plow and ſow upon a rock? The ſame it is to preach to a ſenſleſſe and ſtupid people. As there is <hi>joy,</hi> ſo there is labour; none muſt be a ſluggard at that time: and truly the people muſt labour, and the Miniſter muſt labour; and ſo both joyn together, for the bringing of men to Heaven. Now, becauſe it is ſuch pitty to ſee a field of corn periſh, becauſe there cannot any workmen be had, to cut it down; how much more is it to have a people damned for want of a faithfull and diligent Miniſter? Therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Pray the Lord of the harveſt that he would ſend labourers into his harveſt.</hi> It's Gods harveſt; it's his corn, and therefore we may the more effectually prevail with him in prayer, for this matter. And you ſee here what the title of the Miniſters is, they are <hi>Labourers,</hi> and <hi>labourers in harveſt,</hi> which is the ſoreſt. He ſaith, <hi>The labourers are few:</hi> there were many Prieſts and Scribes, but <hi>few Labourers.</hi> Hence, though the people lived under their Miniſtry, who read and expounded the Law every day, yet, becauſe it was done ſo corruptly, our Saviour had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them, as ſheep without a ſhepherd. So that ſuch as enter upon this work, muſt not dream of eaſe and idleneſſe. All the Names the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them, denote hard work and labour. It is matter of ſollicitude and care, more than honour and dignity. And truly, What Miniſter is there, who reading the labours, zeal and diligence of <hi>Paul</hi> in his Miniſtry, may not cry out, <hi>Oh me adwarf to ſuch a Gyant!</hi> If no Miniſter ſhould be ſaved, unleſſe he be a <hi>Paul,</hi> what would become of moſt of us? Again, they are called <hi>Labourers;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this confuteth the fancies of common people, that think the Miniſters doth not labour at all, that he hath his Maintenance for his eaſe and idleneſſe. As if
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:48709:299"/>
there were no labour, but what is bodily: the labour of the mind, of the heart is greater than that. The Labour of a godly Magiſtrate, and of a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, is tranſcendent to all other Labours. Indeed, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 16. Men are ſufficient for earthly imployments: we cannot ſay, Who is able to be a Tradeſman, to be an Husbandman: but we muſt, Who is able to be a Miniſter? So that is a monſtrous inconſiderateneſſe, though coming from pride and covetouſneſſe, that the <hi>Pope</hi> would have all the Churches in the world to be his charge, and Biſhops but his Curates; yea ſome, <hi>Biſhops, Metropolitans</hi> and <hi>Dioceſans,</hi> they plead to have all the <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> to be their charge, only not aſſuming other Paſtors, <hi>in partem ſollicitudinis,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did. Even as <hi>Ignatius</hi> alſo in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Trallianos,</hi> calleth <hi>Presbyters</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the Biſhops. But alas! if a man be not able to be a Paſtor to one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, how can he be to many? If <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> to help in this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> how much more doth the <hi>Pope</hi> and ſuch <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> need aſſiſtance? As for their diſtinction of inſpection <hi>per ſe, vel per alium,</hi> that will not be made good by the Scripture; which commandeth Paſtors to have a perſonal reſidency, and government over their own flock. Hence God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeveral Officers in the Church, and given various gifts, that all may be imployed for the good of the Church: whereas, though <hi>Paul</hi> was ſuppoſed only faulty about his breach of promiſe, yet they charge <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> with the ſame inconſtancy, thinking all were alike. In the ſecond place we obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That where there is any one real or ſuppoſed fault in one Miniſter, people are apt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Where there is any fault in one Miniſter the people are apt to charge it upon all.</note> 
                  <hi>to charge it upon all other Miniſters, as if they were all alike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was for this that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only apologize for himſelf, but his Aſſociates alſo. But how unreaſonable is this, grant that ſome were truly blame-worthy, muſt all be ſo? If in the Old Teſtament there were many falſe prophets, that <hi>daubed with untempered mortar,</hi> that cried <hi>peace, peace</hi> to ſinners, <hi>when deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was at hand;</hi> ſhall we therefore condemn the good Prophets, who reproved even the greateſt and moſt mighty for their ſins? Becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> was a thief, and for filthy lucre ſake betrayed Chriſt, ſhall we condemn all the Apoſtles, making them to be no better? Muſt <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> be accuſed, Becauſe they thought <hi>Paul</hi> was inconſtant and light? yet thus it falleth out continually, and that from theſe Grounds,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The policy and enmity of falſe teachers, who like</hi> Haman <hi>think it a ſmall matter to deſtroy one</hi> Mordecai, <hi>unleſſe they root out the whole race of the Jews.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The grounds of it. 1. The policy and enmity of falſe Teachers.</note> Thus the falſe Apoſtles concluded; Though <hi>Paul</hi> was diſgraced and vilified, yet if <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> be in eſteem and authority, our Kingdom will fall to the ground. It is therefore the adverſaries deſign to caſt dung in the faces of all the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt, that ſo there might not one be left, that ſhould be uſefull in their place.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Ground is, <hi>From the injudiciouſneſſe and indiſcretion of people; who are credulous, and apt to believe all rumours and reports.</hi> How could it be, that <note place="margin">2. The indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the people.</note> the Phariſees by their calumniating Chriſt as an Impoſtor, and a Blaſphemer, ſhould prevail with the greater part of the people to be on their ſide? becauſe they were blinde, and led by the blinde, they would not make uſe of their own judgement; they would not examine, and try, whether things were ſo, or no.</p>
               <p>And then the third Ground is, <hi>From the natural enmity that is in all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to the Office of the Miniſtry, when faithfully diſcharged.</hi> That is a <note place="margin">3. The natural enmity in man againſt the Miniſtry.</note> burden to them; they muſt needs ſay with <hi>Ahab</hi> to ſuch faithfull <hi>Michaiahs, We hate him, becauſe he alwayes propheſieth evil.</hi> Alas! godly Miniſters cannot give any comfort, cannot promiſe peace to ſuch ungodly perſons,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:48709:299"/>
therefore they have hatred againſt them, and are glad to receive any falſe report concerning them. Miniſters are compared to <hi>Light,</hi> and to <hi>ſalt;</hi> now the Light muſt needs be offenſive to diſtempered eyes, and Salt to ſoars. Thus if the Miniſtery be powerfull to enlighten, to convince, to reprove, no ungodly man can endure this. Therefore it is, that the office of the Miniſtery, when faithfully managed, is ſo great a trouble to wicked men. They are thievs, therefore cannot endure this light: they cry out with <hi>Ahab, haſt thou found mee, O my enemy?</hi> Every Sermon that is powerfull is as bitter as gall and wormwood to them; and therefore there being ſuch an enmity and ill-will againſt them, it is no wonder, if they be quickly prejudiced, and will not believe there is a godly or faithfull Miniſter in the whole Church of God. But I haſten to the Laſt Obſervation; and that is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is a moſt bleſſed and happy thing, when all the Miniſters of God agree</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">'Tis an happy thing when all the Miniſters of God agree to advance Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>with one conſent to advance Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As <hi>Luke</hi> calleth it, <hi>chap. 1. The mouth of all the holy Prophets which have been ſince the beginning of the world.</hi> It was but <hi>one mouth</hi> as it were. They all agreed in the ſame Doctrine, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus;</hi> they all preach the ſame Chriſt; they were not <hi>yea,</hi> or <hi>nay.</hi> This accord and agreement among the Miniſters of the Goſpel is of ſo great concernment, that our Saviour in his valedictory prayer, doth with much efficacy and vigor preſs this Petition, That his Diſciples may be <hi>one,</hi> and one in the moſt near manner imaginable, even as <hi>the father and ſon are one.</hi> I ſhall not enlarge on this, becauſe heretofore much ſpoken off: only I ſhall inſtance in ſome uſefull Effects and conſequences of this happy Agreement. Only before I do that, we have cauſe to take notice of the goodneſs of God, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>manifold wiſdome of God,</hi> whereby he hath provided many Offices, many Officers for his Church, and thoſe variouſly gifted; and all for the ſpiritual benefit of our ſoules: ſome are <hi>Barnabaſſes,</hi> ſome are <hi>Boanergeſes.</hi> Thus as the Kings Daughter is ſaid to be <hi>cloathed with needle work of divers colours;</hi> ſo hath God richly adorned his Church with variety of abilities, that if men be not converted, the greater will be their condemnation. For whereas Auditors are of divers appetites, ſome are for doctrinal Preaching, ſome for affectionate; ſome are for legal terrible Sermons, others for ſweet Evangelical diſcourſes: if Chriſt ſend <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> thus qualified every way, what can they look for, who are not by theſe ſeveral baits allured and taken? For this cauſe we have Chriſt himſelf upbraiding the <hi>Jews,</hi> that no kinde of heavenly way would pleaſe, no kinde of dreſſing the Word of life was acceptable to their palates, <hi>Matth. 11. 18. John came neither eating nor drinking, and they ſay, he hath a devil. The ſon of man came eating and drinking; and they ſay. Behold a friend of publicans and ſinners.</hi> Hereupon he compareth them <hi>to children playing in the markets;</hi> ſaying, <hi>we have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</hi> Thus nothing would do any good to them. Admire then Gods goodneſs, that hath thus abundantly provided for thee. Do not ſimply and enviouſly compare one Miniſters gifts above another, but adore the mercy of God, that uſeth all the different abilities of men for the Churches good. This premiſed, we may from the harmony and Agreement of Miniſters, in advancing Chriſts <note place="margin">The effects of this Agreement. 1. The greater confirmation of the truth.</note> Kingdom ſee</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The greater Confirmation of the truth.</hi> If out of the mouth of <hi>two or three witneſſes,</hi> then how much more out of the mouth of many thouſand witneſſes is every truth abundantly confirmed. How canſt thou give way to any atheiſtical thoughts? whether there be a God, or a day of Judgment, or
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:48709:300"/>
an heaven, or an hell; when thou ſhalt hear ſo many thouſands of Gods ſervants in all ages witneſs to this thing. All the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> men renouned for holineſs, for miracles, they all preached the ſame Doctrines that we do to you. And therefore conſider with thy ſelf what a cloud of witneſſes thou gainſayeſt by thy unbelief.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The greater conſent and harmony, the greater defence there is for the truth.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.

The Papiſt doth confidently conclude, that all will turn to them at laſt; for, ſay they, you have ſo many Sects amongſt you, and one ſaith he hath the ſpirit of God; and another he hath; but all contrary to one another. Now although it were eaſie to recriminate, yet this difference and diviſion is greatly to be lamented. A late Papiſt ſaith, <hi>(Ford</hi> againſt <hi>Taylor) That ſeing Proteſtants write againſt Proteſtants, and fight againſt Proteſtants; and that for the Proteſtant Religion: he hopeth, that at laſt all will ſee cauſe to turn to the Catholique Religion.</hi> But, not to tell them of their Diviſions, though our differences are a great ſtumbling-block, yet to any ſettled judicious Chriſtian they ſhould not prove ſo; for the Scripture doth ſo evidently foretell, that <hi>there muſt be hereſies:</hi> and that <hi>falſe Prophets will ariſe,</hi> that ſhall come in ſuch deceivable wayes, that they would <hi>deceive the very Elect, if poſſible:</hi> and alſo, that God doth for wiſe ends ſuffer all ſuch rents to be, that none ſhould ſtagger thereat, yea the approved will be made more manifeſt: and this file will get off the ruſt from the iron: this winnowing will drive the chaff from the wheat.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>This harmony will be for the greater conviction of every one that</hi>

Go from one Miniſter to another, doeſt thou not hear every one cry down prophaneneſs, incourage to godlineſs? If you hear hundreds of faithfull Miniſters, what is the work of all, but to ſubdue ſin, to diſpoſſeſs Satan, to bring men into obedience unto Chriſt: Do we not all come with the ſame Embaſſage? Intreating of you to be reconciled to God; and to <hi>agree with this adverſary while you are in the way.</hi> What can more convince, yea confound than this? It was this which brought utter deſtruction upon <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> there was then no more remedy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16. It was not one or two, but many Meſſengers he ſent; and yet all theſe were refuſed, with the ſame diſobedient heart. All the Prophets and faithfull Paſtors that have ever been in ſeveral ages will riſe up againſt thee for thy condemnation in that day, directly, or indirectly, one way or other they will witneſs againſt thee.</p>

               <p>VVE are now arrived at the laſt Particular to be conſidered in this <hi>Verſe;</hi> which is, The Predicate affirmed of the Doctrine preached by <hi>Paul</hi> and his Aſſociates: and that is, <hi>It's not Yea, and Nay, but Yea.</hi> The expreſſion hath been explained already. The ſenſe is, That <hi>the Doctrine of Chriſt is certain, conſtant, and immutable.</hi> As alſo, that ſuch only are to be accounted of, as true Doctors, who do adhere to the ſame truth. For <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith gravely upon the Text, That this taxeth all verſatil and <hi>Proteus-</hi>like men, who can transform themſelves into any ſhape; preach one time one Doctrine, for their advantage; and then again change, and preach the contrary: or elſe, for ſinfull fear, do at one time aſſert ſuch Doctrines, as true, and afterwards retract and recant them again: whereas the truth of Chriſt is like Chriſt himſelf, <hi>The ſame yeſterday, today, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8. and like God himſelf, <hi>who changeth not: yea, in whom is no ſhadow of change.</hi> So that from the words we may obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is a proper note of Gods truth, and true preachers thereof, that they</hi>

                  <hi>are alwayes the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no change, no contrariety in their Doctrines. As the Apoſtle (you heard) expreſſed it, <hi>If I build again the things which I deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a tranſgreſſor,</hi> Gal. 2. 18. It is in an heynous manner to tranſgreſs, when a Miniſter is thus contradictory. This Doctrine is the more to be obſerved, becauſe <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his Antidotes upon this Text maketh a long harangue, to demonſtrate, that <hi>Luther, Melanchthon, Zwinglius, Calvin,</hi> all the eminent Reformers, cannot be the true Apoſtles of Chriſt; becauſe in their writings there was <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay;</hi> one while they preached ſuch and ſuch things; at another time the clean contrary. Hence he brings a paſſage out of <hi>Zwinglius</hi> confeſſing that he did <hi>tempori,</hi> not <hi>rei ſcribere, he did write to ſerve the time, not the matter:</hi> that he could not deliver pearl, becauſe for the preſent auditors like ſwine would trample it under their feet, and rend him alſo; eſpecially <hi>Melanchthon</hi> is inſtanced in, as a very <hi>inconſtant man,</hi> in whoſe judgment they could put no confidence. Hence he alledgeth a Synod of the <hi>Flaccians,</hi> who were rigid <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that call his Common-places, <hi>Jocos communes,</hi> and not <hi>Locos communes;</hi> and much more to this purpoſe. We finde him triumphing in the incertainty of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Doctrine; ſo that although we know what they hold this year, we cannot tell what they will the next, and in the conſtancy
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:48709:301"/>
of their Popiſh Religion, which they have adhered unto for many years. To all this we will readily grant, that the truths of Chriſt are alwayes the ſame; there cannot be any more new truths, than a new Chriſt, than a new Bible; and therefore we will grant the <hi>Theſis,</hi> but deny the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> or application of it to <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> that whereſoever there is <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> there cannot be the truths of Chriſt. But that we may throughly underſtand this point, let us conſider theſe particulars,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That we muſt diſtinguiſh between the external adminiſtrations, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the external formes of Gods worſhip and doctrinals.</note> 
                  <hi>formes of Gods worſhip, and the doctrinalls; between the Diducticalls and the Rituals.</hi> For the former, though appointed by God himſelf, yet we plainly ſee a great a teration therein. What a vaſt difference is there between the ſervice and Sacraments of God, in the old, and in the new Teſtament? There was <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and the <hi>Paſchal Lamb;</hi> we have <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper:</hi> there were Sacrifices, and many external Rites, and Ceremonies, which when Chriſt the ſubſtance came, they preſently vaniſhed, as the bloſſome falleth when the bud cometh. This great change, with ſome other Arguments, made the <hi>Marcionites</hi> of old conclude, that it was not the ſame God of the Old, and New Teſtament, but different; but that is abſurd. The Church adminiſtrations, though by Gods command, are now altered; ſo that it would be a heynous thing to circumciſe children, to offer Sacrifices to God; though once it was the peoples duty. Here you ſee then, there is a lawfull <hi>yea and nay;</hi> a time when we might circumciſe, and a time when we muſt not circumciſe. And if you ſay, Doth not this argue inconſtancy in God? doth not this contradict that glorious Attribute of his <hi>immutability?</hi> I anſwer, No; for God doth here as the Phyſician with a diſeaſed perſon, that ſometimes adminiſtreth one kinde of Phyſick, and ſometimes another; according as the nature of the diſeaſe requireth: or, as the husbandman ſoweth his ground, ſometimes with one ſeed, and ſometimes with another. God then was pleaſed to appoint ſuch a temporary worſhip, and afterwards to appoint another, which was more ſuteable to the Church, being now no longer an infant, as the Apoſtle inſinuateth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. As therefore the mother ordereth her childe otherwiſe, while a childe, than when an adult perſon; ſo did God with his Church. But then, if we come to the <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> we ſhall finde, that the ſame truths neceſſary to ſalvation were in the Old Teſtament, as the New; <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and all the Godly were juſtified by <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> as well as the Believers in the Goſpel. This indeed is that which the <hi>Socinians</hi> pertinaciouſly deny: they think that the Godly in the Old Teſtament did not believe in Chriſt; that this is a peculiar new duty required under the Goſpel, and never before, <hi>viz. to believe in Chriſt.</hi> But the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth admirably open the myſterious ſignification of thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ceremonies and ſacrifices, ſhewing that Chriſt was repreſented therein, and that it was not the blood of <hi>Rams</hi> and <hi>goats,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that did take away ſin. Hence <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid <hi>to ſee Chriſts day, and rejoyce. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. they are ſaid <hi>to drink of the ſpiritual rock, which was Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>Act. 15. 10, 11. Peter</hi> and the Councel ſpeaking of the yoke laid upon our fathers, addeth, <hi>But we believe, that through the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall be ſaved, even as they.</hi> The Doctrine then of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> of <hi>eternal Life</hi> were in the old Teſtament as well as the New; only more implicitely and obſcurely; the Old Teſtament being the New hidden and covered; the New being the Old revealed and explained: ſo that, the Old and New Teſtament do not contain old and new Doctrine eſſentially, but gradually; as we ſay, the old and new moon, not meaning two moons, but diſtinct diſcoveries <note place="margin">2. Between the growth and the change of truth.</note> of light therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We are to distinguiſh between progreſs and growth in the ſame truth, and
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:48709:301"/>
the alteration or change of truth into errour.</hi> And truly this is of great conſideration; for this very particular will obviate all the calumnies of the Papiſt. Let it be granted, that the firſt Reformers did not did not at firſt view, ſee all the truths of the Chriſtian Religion, but that by degrees they had ſcales fall off from their eyes, and ſome things that at firſt they thought true, or tolerable, afterwards they rejected, as falſe and abominable. And thus <hi>Calvin (de ſcandalis)</hi> anſwereth the Papiſts, who calumniate us, ſaying, <hi>If you had the ſpirit of God, why did ye not ſee all truth preſently? Why was it that ſome things did appear falſe to you afterwards, which did not ſo at firſt? This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is to envy us proficiency in the truth; and to expect, that the Sun in the morning ſhould ſhine as gloriouſly as at noon day.</hi> So that it is one thing <hi>addere aedificium fundamento,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calleth it, and another thing to make a new Foundation; Thus <hi>Lyrinenſis,</hi> when he made this Objection, <hi>To what uſe are Doctors and Officers of the Church, if ſo be they muſt only receive the Doctrine delivered, and not excogitate new by their own wit?</hi> He anſwereth, There is <hi>profectus,</hi> but not <hi>permutatio</hi> allowed, <hi>a growth,</hi> but not <hi>a change.</hi> The work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is not to finde out new, real, fundamental truths, no more than a new Chriſt, or a new Bible. he that cannot ſee by one Sun, would not by twenty; and he that will not be convinced by one Bible, would not, if there were more. Yet they are not uſeleſs, for theſe Fundamentals they are dayly to confirm, to explain, to poliſh, and affectionately to improve for Sanctification more and more: ſo that, as he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they muſt not deliver <hi>nova,</hi> yet they may <hi>nova:</hi> not <hi>new things,</hi> but in <hi>a new manner.</hi> When a childe groweth up into a man, he ſtill retaineth his humane nature, though there be an increaſe in his ſtature; but if this childe ſhould grow into a horſe, or a bear, then this would be a change of his ſpecies, and his na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e: Thus the Church and her Officers they are to grow in more light, in more knowledg, in more faith; but ſtill in the ſame truth: whereas, if they degenerate into Errors and falſe Doctrines, then the <hi>ſpecies</hi> is altered: now it is not hony but gall, it is not gold but droſs, not meat but poyſon: So that if we ſee eminent men growing out of thoſe errors, and thoſe Superſtitions they were once intangled in, you muſt not call this <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> but a laudable duty: for we ſee the ſpirit of God communicating it ſelf by degrees: Even as the Sun doth not preſently ariſe to its vertical point: ſo neither doth the ſpirit of God reveal all things at once: It cometh in by degrees, he could perfect our underſtandings even in this life, as much as they ſhall be in heaven, ſo that, we ſhall no longer know in part: but he is pleaſed to work gradually, even as he did make the world, not in an inſtant, but ſucceſſively. Thus we ſee he did to the very Apoſtles, they were under his Inſtruction and Government a good while, and yet were ignorant in many particulars, till at laſt he confirmed them from his ſpirit from above. The Proteſtants then are not guilty of <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> though they did not at firſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſcover all the abominations of Popery. Neither may we charge any particular Miniſter for <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> if out of error he proceed to truth, if from darkneſs he attaineth to more light: For, although many Heretical perſons may ſhrowd themſelves under the ſerious name of new light, yet it is plain; that both Paſtors and people are to grow in new light gradually, though not ſpecifically. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 19. commendeth the believers, for <hi>attending unto the word of God, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the day-ſtarre ariſe in their hearts:</hi> not as if ever they could come to light enough, that they need not to attend to Scripture any further,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:48709:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they may throw away the Bible as uſeleſs, having light enough within them. No, but that <hi>donec,</hi> that <hi>until,</hi> is continual and alwayes, as ſometimes it is uſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We are to diſtinguiſh between Yea and Nay indeed, and a ſeeming yea and nay:</hi> between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

We grant, that ſuch corruptions, ſuch darkneſs may cover the face of the Church, that the true Doctrines of Chriſt may ſeem new, and be condemned for <hi>novelllſm;</hi> and the Doctor who preached them, be thought to come with his <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay.</hi> And thus again <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> with many others are condemned for their inconſtancy. They were once ours, ſay the Papiſts, they did once believe as we believed, worſhip as we worſhipped; but now they are a <hi>nay</hi> to their <hi>yea.</hi> This calumny will eaſily vaniſh, if you diſtinguiſh between <hi>new things indeed,</hi> and <hi>new things appearingly ſo.</hi> The Proteſtant Doctrine was not new indeed, if you look to the Scripture and Chriſt, it is old as they are; but then we grant, that if we conſider the <hi>Chaos,</hi> the Church was in at that time, what ſuperſtitious abominations did then prevail; we grant, what the Reformers did, all was new, their ſervice new, their Doctrine new; but the iniquity and the corruption of the times made it appear to be ſo. And indeed Popery is properly the great <hi>Novelliſme:</hi> for the Popiſh Doctrines, the Popiſh Worſhip began to creep in, when the Churches of Chriſt began to degenerate from their Primitive Inſtitution. The change then that is many times in the face of Religion, which doth ſo offend many, is not indeed ſo, but in appearance. Thoſe truths of God were formerly profeſſed in the Church; only an Eclipſe did ariſe, which obſcured the light of the Sun. As then the Sun is not changed after an Eclipſe, we do not ſee a new Sun: thus it is alſo with the truths of Chriſt; the Reformers do not bring new truths, only the darkneſs is diſpelled, and we ſee them which were long before. It is with us, as with men, whoſe heads are diſtempered; we think, ſuch and ſuch things run round, whereas indeed it is a diſtemper upon us, and it is a ſigne that we have been corrupted, when old truths ſeem new to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We may therefore truly conclude, that antiquity and conſent are inſeparable properties of a true Church.</hi> That Church which retaineth Doctrines of the <note place="margin">4. Antiquity and conſent are properties of a true Church.</note> greateſt Antiquity, and which doth agree with the Primitive Apoſtolical Churches, that muſt needs be a true Church, for truth is alwayes alike. That cannot be true Doctrine in one age which is not in another: though men are apt to be changed by the times they live in, yet Gods truth cannot be. When therefore the Papiſts bring antiquity, and conſent as notes of a true Church, we deny they can, or are to be called notes, becauſe it is not <hi>Antiquity</hi> barely, but <hi>antiqvity</hi> in the <hi>true Doctrine:</hi> nor <hi>Conſent</hi> meerly ſo, but <hi>conſent with the Primitive Churches Doctrine.</hi> So that True Doctrine is properly the note of the Church; only we add, that <hi>Antiquity and Conſent with the Primitive times</hi> do inſeparably follow the true Doctrine. Now the ground of this certainty and equality of the truths of Chriſt is, becauſe they are Gods truths, Chriſts truths: if they were the truths of mens making, then they might alter and change as they pleaſe, then it might be formed, reformed, and transformed into all the ſhapes that mens Intereſts could put them upon; then truth might alter according to the climates, cuſtomes, and advantages of men; then truth might be one thing at
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:48709:302"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and another thing at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> then we might ſay, ſuch things were truth in one age, and ye the contrary truth in another. Popery was truth in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, and Proteſtantiſme in Queen <hi>Elizabeths.</hi> And truly ſome men are ſo Atheiſtical, or ſelf-ſeeking, that they account truth, as the Apoſtle ſaid, ſome did godlineſs, even outward gain; and therefore, when ſuch an opinion is gainfull, then it is truth, but when not ſo, then it is Hereſie.</p>

                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction.</hi> How odious Inſtability and Inconſtancy is in matter of Religion, whether it be in private Chriſtians, or publick Officers? It plainly diſcovereth, that not the truth of Chriſt, but ſome other uncertain motive prevaileth with thee; either thy profit, or thy applauſe, or the times, or cuſtomes, or the Lawes of the Land, or ſome other mutable reſpect doth work upon thee: and if ſo, then thou canſt not but be a reed ſhaken with every winde of Doctrine. Thou art then but as an Inſtrument of muſick, making no other ſound, nor no longer then thou art breathed into. Profit will make thee a Papiſt, profit will make thee a proteſtant, profit will make thee an Heretick. How contrary is ſuch a fickle temper to the nature of Faith? which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</p>

It is a ridiculous paſſage of a Papiſt <hi>(Ford againſt Taylor)</hi> ſaying, <hi>that it is probable, the Church will make that Opinion about the immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary to be an Article of Faith.</hi> As if the Church could make that neceſſary to be believed, if we would be ſaved, that was not alwayes ſo.

               <p>And 1. take notice, That <hi>God might only have dealt with man by his abſolute</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. God might have dealt with man by abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</note> 
                  <hi>Soveraignty and dominion;</hi> impoſing only upon him commands to do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without adjoyning any promiſe of a reward, eſpecially ſuch a reward as eternall happineſſe, and truly this maketh much as for our comfort, ſo alſo for our humiliation under all the holy works we do. For it is of Gods meer goodneſſe, that he hath promiſed glory to thy repentance, to thy obedience; after thou haſt done all, God might have annihilated thee; neither would he have done thee any wrong, if he did not put a crown of glory upon thee, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy holy life; ſo that its gods great condeſcention to deal by way of promiſe with us, and not by way of dominion and command alone; as he might do, he being our Creator and we his creatures.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The promiſes that God maketh to us are truly and properly promiſes;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God are properly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> They are more then ſimple and bare aſſertions of what good he will do to us. We know amongſt men, there is a great difference between a bare affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation what he will do, and a promiſe; for that addeth a new bond and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to a man, for fullfilling his word. Now ſome have thought, that thoſe paſſages which we call <hi>promiſes</hi> are not ſo properly and truly <hi>promiſes,</hi> as meer inſinuations and ſignifications of Gods will and purpoſe what he will do. Thus <hi>Durand</hi> expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>lib. 2. diſt. 27. queſt.</hi> 2. becauſe happily it may be thought that we attribute imperfection to God, when we ſay, that he <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi> properly; for then thereby would accrue juſtice on mans part, and a right or claim in him to the things promiſed, hereby alſo the liberty of God would ſeem to be infringed, as if he could not beſtow his gifts any other way then <hi>he promiſed,</hi> but theſe are no cogent reaſons. And ſeeing the Scripture doth ſo often call them <hi>promiſes,</hi> and doth ſo conſtantly ſay, <hi>God doth promiſe;</hi> there is no reaſon why we ſhould go from the proper ſignification of the word to an improper, eſpecially there being no imperfection in the act of <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> For meerly as ſo, that denoteth a dominion and power in him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth: and certainly if the actuall giving and collation of any good thing, doth not declare any imperfection in God, why ſhould the <hi>promiſing</hi> of it do? For when God hath beſtowed any thing upon us, that is not ſo alienated, as it were, but that ſtill it is his, and at his diſpoſing, to continue or takeaway, as he pleaſeth: we therefore conclude, that God doth truly and properly, not
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:48709:304"/>
in a metaphoricall ſence make promiſes to his people. Yet</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>the reaſon of Gods promiſing, is not as if that were to adde</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes do not adde to his ſimple affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but only are to confirm our faith.</note> 
                  <hi>more confirmation to his ſimple affirmation, but for condeſcenſion to confirm us againſt our unbeleef and diffidence.</hi> Hence there is a vaſt difference between <hi>mans promiſe</hi> and <hi>Gods promiſe.</hi> For the <hi>promiſe of a man</hi> doth adde a new tye and obligation to his word, and ſo his word is made ſurer in it ſelf, as well as to thoſe whom he promiſeth; but when God doth barely declare his will to do ſuch good things for a beleever, this hath truth enough, yea, ſo much that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added to make it truer; only becauſe we are apt to conceive of God, after the manner of men, it doth greatly conduce to ſtrengthen our faith, as well as his affirming word; yea, ſometimes to his <hi>promiſe,</hi> God is alſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to adde his <hi>oath;</hi> all which is not in reſpect of himſelf, as if his word could be made truer, but only to antidote the more ſtrongly againſt that diffidence and diſtruſt which is apt to riſe up in our hearts. This the Apoſtle notably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7. when he ſaith, <hi>That God to declare the immutability of his counſell, confirmed the promiſe by an oath, ſo that by two immutable things in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have a strong conſolation.</hi> It is not for his own ſake that he promiſeth, yea, that he ſweareth, but for our ſakes, <hi>that we might have not</hi> only <hi>conſolation</hi> but <hi>strong conſolation. O beatos nos,</hi> &amp;c. cryed <hi>Tertullian, Oh happy us, for whoſe ſakes God doth thus ſwear; but oh us wretched and miſerable, if we do not beleeve him thus confirming his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi> ſo that the right underſtanding of Gods promiſe will make us ſee, that it is not for his own ſake, but our ſakes, that he dealeth in a promiſe-way with us.</p>
               <p>Hence in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place, <hi>The meer originall and riſe of Gods promiſing any</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. The riſe of all Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes is his free mercy.</note> 
                  <hi>good to us, is the bounty, liberality, and free mercy of God.</hi> The Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have not the leaſt promiſe of any good to them, ſo that being without a promiſe, they are in that reſpect altogether miſerable; but the Lord having a love to mankinde, did freely and graciouſly make his promiſe of Chriſt, and in him all bleſſedneſſe to thoſe that are his; Inſomuch that the ſpring of all our happineſs is Gods promiſe. We cannot pleade any worthineſs, only thy promiſes (Lord) that we put thee in minde of, which is like the rainbow, when God behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that he will not drown the world more; and when God remembreth his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, then he worketh all good for his people. Thus when God would delay his help no longer, but deliver his people groaning under their oppreſſions; It is ſaid, <hi>God remembred his Covenant with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> Exod. 2. 24. there was no <hi>natural neceſſity,</hi> nor no <hi>morall neceſſity</hi> that could induce God to make theſe promiſes to us. No <hi>naturall neceſſity,</hi> for God is a free agent, and ſo doth not as the Bee, that neceſſarily maketh his honey, God doth not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily communicate his goodneſſe to us: As God is a free agent, ſo he is alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; he is perfect and bleſſed in himſelf, he needeth not man, he wanteth not his ſervice; and therefore he did not upon this account make any promiſe, but it was his meer voluntary goodneſſe. Again, there was no <hi>morall neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that is, there was no ſuppoſed worth or dignity in us, for which it behoved God to make ſuch promiſes; He found nothing in us but matter of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and wrath: to us all the threatnings in the Law did belong, and not one promiſe, Inſomuch as the damned in hell have not any promiſe made to them; they have not the leaſt ground for any hope, no not for a drop of water to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them in thoſe ſcorching flames, ſo it might be with every man if Gods grace did not interpoſe; not any promiſe might have been made for thee, to have the leaſt dependance upon. Thus you ſee Gods mercy alone to be the <note place="margin">5. Therefore the fullfilling of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is only of grace.</note> ground of all promiſes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Becauſe God doth this out of his meer bounty, make a promiſe of good things to us, the fullfilling of them is not of debt to us, but from his grace and
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:48709:304"/>
verity.</hi> And thus it differeth from the <hi>promiſes</hi> between man and man, that are made in contracts, or otherwiſe; there a promiſe is made, but upon ſome conſideration or work done, which is equivalent to the thing promiſed: but it is otherwiſe with God, he promiſeth out of grace, and fullfilleth it likewiſe out of grace. Thus when God hath promiſed pardon to the humbled ſinner, and beleeving not only the <hi>promiſe,</hi> but the actuall pardoning is of grace; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God by his <hi>promiſe</hi> become a debtor to us, as if God would be unjuſt, if he did not beſtow ſuch a priviledge upon us; but becauſe, as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>he cannot lye, or he cannot deny himſelf.</hi> So that the reaſon why he maketh good his promiſes, is not becauſe we have any condignity in our ſelves to claim thoſe things, but becauſe he is immutable and unchangeable: ſo that upon this account he maketh good his promiſes, even becauſe he is God, and cannot lye, or change his minde. Therefore Divines ſpeak well of a twofold <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum</hi> about Gods promiſes, <hi>debitum fidelitatis,</hi> and <hi>debitum juſtitiae; a debt of fidelity,</hi> and <hi>a debt of juſtice.</hi> When God maketh a promiſe of eternall life to a godly man, he may urge God with his promiſe; and there is <hi>a debt of fidelity,</hi> whereby God hath engaged himſelf to do this; but we cannot ſay, God is a debtor to man hereby; no, he is a debtor, as it were, to himſelf, he cannot go againſt his own word, his truth will not ſuffer him to change; but in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect muſt we ſay he is a debtor to man, <hi>reddis debita nulli debens,</hi> it was ſaid of old. This is neceſſarily to be underſtood, that ſo under all the promiſes of God made to us, we may not look upon our ſelves, but Gods promiſe only. But then there is a <hi>debt of juſtice</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and herein many <hi>Papiſts</hi> are proud and arrogant; for they diſtinguiſh of Gods <hi>promiſes,</hi> thoſe that are for the firſt grace, and thoſe that are for the ſecond and after grace. They grant the promiſe of the firſt grace to be only from a <hi>debt of fidelity,</hi> but then for the ſecond grace, they maintain a <hi>debt of juſtice.</hi> Hence it is that they conclude, that heaven and ſalvation, though we have it by the promiſe of God, yet it is by <hi>debt of juſtice,</hi> and not meer grace. Hence we reade of a dying Monk, who bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemouſly uttered theſe words, <hi>Redde mihi, Domine, vitam aeternam, quam debes, ſive velis, ſive nolis;</hi> but a gracious heart cannot but tremble at ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancies. It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth God <hi>a righteous Judge, who will give him a crown of glory:</hi> and he telleth the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget their labour of love,</hi> Heb. 6. 10. but <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> is not here taken ſtrictly for proper <hi>justice,</hi> but for <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſſe.</hi> If God ſhould not give heaven to his people, who endure perſecution for his Name ſake, he would go againſt his own nature, he would deny his truth, and ſo even ceaſe to be God; not that he would be unjuſt properly to man, as if man by doing or ſuffering any thing for his ſake, did that which was equivalent to eternall glory. We ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle defying this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. calling it, but <hi>a light affliction, and for a moment,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>that eternall weight of glory.</hi> And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved, that <hi>there cannot be juſtice, or righteouſneſſe between us and the gods, and our Parents;</hi> for their is no equality, and we owe all to them. And as <hi>Durand</hi> well argueth, it is ſo far from juſtice or righteouſneſſe that we may claim glory, that the more grace God hath given us to prepare thereunto, the more we are beholding to him, and can the leſſe pleade for our ſelves, by how much the more we receive of his grace; ſo that the more gracious acts we do, we are ſo far from meriting, that we are the more obliged to God. Yet</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Leſt becauſe all the promiſes of God are ſaid to be fullfilled of his <note place="margin">6. The promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God are abſolute or conditional.</note> grace only, and becauſe all works of ours are rejected as cauſall and meritorious, we ſhould fall into Antinomianiſin, and fancy to our ſelves ſuch abſolute and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpective promiſes, that though abiding and wallowing in our ſins, yet we might think it lawfull to run to them as to a city of refuge, and there to be delivered from the guilt of our ſins: we muſt know that <hi>the promiſes of God are of two
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:48709:305"/>
ſorts, abſolute and conditionall; Abſolute,</hi> and ſuch are the promiſes of God, for the working of our firſt grace in us of converſion, and taking away the heart of ſtone from us, of which promiſe the Prophets <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ezechiet</hi> ſpeak; Though ſome will not allow thoſe to be <hi>promiſes,</hi> but predictions, yet the very tenour of them doth evidence it. Now theſe do not ſuppoſe, but work all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and qualifications in us for other mercies, for it would be abſurd to ſay, God promiſeth to give us faith if we do beleeve, or to renew and change our wils if we will: Theſe abſolute promiſes then are the executions of his decrees of grace and ſalvation upon the Elect. But then there are <hi>conditional promiſes,</hi> and ſuch are the promiſes of pardon to the beleever, of eternal glory to him that is godly; only you muſt know, that they are conditions only in a large ſence; they are more properly called <hi>qualifications</hi> and <hi>determinations</hi> of thoſe who are thus to be juſtified and ſaved: faith indeed in our juſtification hath a peculiar notion of being an inſtrument or ſupernaturall means to lay hold on Chriſt, and is not to be called a <hi>condition,</hi> when we ſpeak exactly: You ſee then that there is no ground for licentiouſneſſe and diſſoluteneſſe, to venture all upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of God, for they are determined and ſpecified by ſuch qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, who ſhall have either pardon here, or ſalvation hereafter: Only you muſt know, that when we call them <hi>conditionall promiſes,</hi> the meaning is not as if we had power of our own to fullfill theſe conditions, and ſo the promiſes remain ſuſpenſe till we perform them; no, theſe conditions we are enabled to accompliſh by the grace of God, they are his gifts as well as our duties; ſo that there are no conditions required of us, which alſo we are not enabled unto by the grace of God; that all may glory in Gods grace, and not in themſelves, and therefore God hath appointed an order between his gracious gifts; this god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is for happineſſe, holineſſe is for glory, faith is for juſtification, and if we ſpeak exactly, we cannot ſo well ſay, Gods promiſes are conditionall, as the things promiſed may be conditions to one another by Gods appointment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There may be good reaſons aſſigned why God is pleaſed thus to promiſe;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">7. There may be reaſons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why God made ſuch promiſes. As 1.

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe hereby God would exerciſe our faith, and teach us to live upon him only;</hi> for when we cannot ſee any poſſibility in ſecond cauſes, when they with <hi>Sarah</hi> have a dead womb, yet becauſe of Gods promiſe we ſhall keep up our hearts, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: Why is it then that the promiſes of God are in no more eſteem and requeſt with us? were it not for them, how many times might thy heart break. Yea, to put our faith to greater experiment, hence it is, that though he hath promiſed ſuch things, yet his providences ſeem to croſſe all, and after Gods promiſe, as it was in the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> deliverance, all things ſeem to be more unlikely than before.</p>

               <p>In the firſt place, we may give in diviſions of the <hi>Promiſes,</hi> or the diſtribution of them, as there are <hi>Legal Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Evangelical Promiſes;</hi> the ignorant confuſion whereof hath cauſed much miſchief in the Church of God. The <hi>Legal Promiſe</hi> is nothing but the Covenant of works, contained in that expreſſion, <hi>Do this and live.</hi> For as they are curſed, who continue not in all things that the Law requireth: So again, they are bleſſed, and eternal life is promiſed to all ſuch, who perfectly obey the Law of God. By this promiſe God dealt with <hi>Adam.</hi> And although God never tranſacted with man, when fallen, by this way of promiſe; yet he was pleaſed to have the Doctrine of the Law in its full perfection manifeſted to the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but in an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical intention, that ſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being humbled under their utter impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and inability ever to performe it, might make their earneſt applications unto Chriſt for help and ſuccour. For what was impoſſible by the Law, through our weakneſſe, Chriſt made poſſible through his obedience. Now this <hi>Legal Promiſe</hi> the <hi>Jewes</hi> generally attended unto, neglecting the <hi>Evangelical</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of promiſes in Chriſt. The promiſes to works made unto <hi>Adam</hi> are not intended in this Text: they were not <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> ſeeing there was no need of a Mediator, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen; onely now all the promiſes of grace become firme and ſure in him. But naturally we regard the <hi>Legal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> more than <hi>Evangelical.</hi> What labour did the Apoſtle ſhew to bring the <hi>Jewes</hi> off from the Covenant of works? And whence is that Phariſaical and Popiſh principle of ſelf-righteouſneſſe; but becauſe we truſt in our works, and not in the promiſe? So that it is an excellent proficiency in Chriſtianity, when perſons are taken off from being Legal, to be Evangelical; when they doe not ſlaviſhly relie upon their works done, but filially depend upon the promiſe. The Apoſtle doth excellently, and at large declare the difference between theſe two, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. and 4. Chapters. It is ſtrange that any ſhould deſire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, rather than the promiſe; yet all Phariſaical Juſticiaries are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe that way. What is this but to deſire to be under a curſe, and perpetual malediction? Whereas the <hi>Evangelical promiſe</hi> is like the City of refuge to the purſued malefactour. It is better than <hi>Jonah</hi>'s gourd againſt the ſcorching heat of Gods wrath, becauſe of ſinne; for no worme can ariſe and conſume this. So that the <hi>Evangelical promiſe</hi> being wholly of free-grace, God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:48709:306"/>
pardoning us freely, ſanctifying us freely, juſtifying us freely, is like the Land of promiſe flowing with milk and honey. It's to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is promiſe, that every humbled ſinner muſt look, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtung did upon the brazen ſrepent. Let therefore the people of God look more to the promiſe without them: They poreupon their own hearts; they perplex themſelves with many doubts and feares; but if thou didſt conſider what an <hi>Evangelical Promiſe</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, this would be like oyle poured into thy wounds, when temptations aggravated by Satan, have left thee not ſo much halfe dead, as halfe damned.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Promiſes are divided in respect of their object matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Promiſes are either ſpiritual or temporal.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpiritual and temporal. Spiritual</hi> are ſuch as concern the welfare of the ſoul: <hi>Temporal</hi> are ſuch as relate to the body and the outward man; for there is no external mercy, but God hath promiſed it to the godly. Therefore god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe is ſaid to have <hi>the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. In deed in the Old Teſtament <hi>temporal promiſes</hi> were more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> more rare; and many times ſhadowed out by the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ones. In the New Teſtament, <hi>ſpiritual promiſes</hi> are farre more frequent, and <hi>temporal</hi> ones more rare; yet the New Teſtament doth abundantly teſtifie this, <hi>That all things are the godly mans, whether life or death,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 23. and that onely they <hi>have the promiſe of this life, as well as that which is to come.</hi> And certainly, <hi>If God hath given us Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Rom. 18. how ſhall he not with him give us all things elſe?</hi> So that we ſee the treaſure of a Chriſtian, it lieth in Gods promiſes, both for this life, and the life to come. So that as it falleth out ſometimes, a man may have little money for his preſent uſe, and yet be very rich in bonds and bils. Thus it is ſometimes with a godly man, though he hath a promiſe of all things, yet for the preſent he may want all things. As <hi>Abraham</hi> had a promiſe for the poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and yet for the preſent had not where to ſet his foot, as upon his own ground. Onely we muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>temporal promiſes,</hi> theſe later are not abſolutely promiſed, but with the exception of the Croſſe, and with this limitation, when they are good for us. For ſeeing theſe earthly mercies are not ablutely and as indipenſably neceſſary, as Chriſtand grace are, ſo therefore no wonder if they be not abſolutely promiſed. If a godly man could not be ſaved, unleſſe he had riches and wealth, unleſſe he had health and ſtrength, then he was as ſure to have them, as he hath Chriſt; but that not being ſo, therefore it is that they have Chriſt, and yet many times want other things. They have the Ocean, when they cannot have a drop. Again, <hi>Temporal good things</hi> are not abſolutely good, but conditionally, and upon ſuppoſition; though they may be good in themſelves, yet not to thee. As wine may be in it ſelf comforting, but not unto a man in a feaver: Thus it may be, if thou ſhouldſt have riches, they would doe thee hurt; if thou ſhouldſt have health and ſtrength, thy corruptions alſo would be the ſtronger. Thoſe things are not called <hi>good,</hi> becauſe they make us <hi>good;</hi> no, we may make them good or evil. But now Chriſt is ſuch an infinite good, that thy having of him can never be hurtfull to thee:? Yea, when he finds thee evil, he can make thee good. It is good to informe our ſelves thus about the nature of <hi>temporal promiſes;</hi> for we are ready to murmure and repine, when we find not theſe promiſes made good to us; whereas we ſhould rather be thankfull and rejoyce, in that God will not give us that which would doe us ſo much hurt. And certainly, if thou wert <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as thou ſhouldſt be, this would be enough to thee, that <hi>ſpiritual things</hi> are abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that thou art ſure to have Chriſt, to have Heaven, how ſad and afflicted ſoever thy portion may be in this world. Doth it not argue thy heart to be too carnal, when thou mourneſt for want of outward mercies,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:48709:306"/>
and yet Chriſt is thine, God hath ſanctified thee, God hath converted thee. Alas hath not God in this done more for thee, than the greateſt Emperours in the world, that have not godlineſſe? What if thou haſt not riches, the greatneſſe others have? It may be they have not the Chriſt, the grace that God hath beſtowed on thee. Onely when we ſay <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things are abſolutely promiſed, you muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> things: ſome are <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily conjoyned</hi> with eternal glory; ſo that if he have them not, he cannot be ſaved; ſuch is Regeneration and Juſtification. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, others doe much conduce to our eternal happineſſe, but are not inſeparably joyned with it; ſuch are the degrees of grace, ſpiritual conſolation and joy, as alſo the aſſurance of Gods favour. Theſe are precions-advantages; more to be deſired than the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> but they are not abſolutely promiſed to every godly man.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond general place, <hi>We are to know, that the promiſes of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are the executions of his Decrees.</note> 
                  <hi>they are the executions in time of what he had decreed to doe from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Inſomuch that from Gods promiſe, we may argue to his predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when God promiſeth Juſtification, and pardon of ſinne to thee, it is becauſe he hath purpoſed this according to the counſel of his own will. So when he promiſeth to give grace to thee, and the encreaſe thereof, it is becauſe he hath in mercy ordained thee for this. If you ask then, why is it, ſuch and ſuch promiſes are fullfilled? You muſt not have recourſe to mans free-will, or any workes that he doth, but to the will of God and his gracious counſel. Hence ſome expound that place, <hi>(Titus</hi> 1. 2. where it is ſaid; <hi>That God who cannot lie, had promiſed eternal life before the world began;)</hi> of his decree to promiſe: for it is not proper to ſay, God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the world was. Seeing then there was no men to whom the promiſe could be made; therefore (ſay they) the meaning is, <hi>He decreed to promiſe.</hi> But there is another interpretation more probable, which is to render the Greek words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>before the ancient ages,</hi> alluding to the firſt promiſe that God made to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his fall concerning the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed, which was Chriſt. For till that promiſe was manifeſted, there was no difference in reſpect of hope and comfort between loſt mankind, and the Apoſtate Angels. The promiſes then of God are but Gods predeſtination put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution.</p>
               <p>Hence in the third place, <hi>No wicked men have any promiſes of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them.</hi> Therefore the ſtate of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> Epheſ. 2. is ſaid to be <note place="margin">3. No wicked men have any promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them.</note> 
                  <hi>without Chriſt, and without the promiſes;</hi> which argueth as deſperate a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as when thoſe of the old world, were without the Ark, there was a neceſſity of periſhing. It is true, all wicked men, who live within the Church, they cannot in that ſenſe be ſaid to be <hi>without the promiſes,</hi> as <hi>Heathens</hi> are; for they are under the offer of promiſes, they are under the external diſpenſation of them; and becauſe they manifeſt an outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Gods offer with the conditions tendered, therefore we may call them the children of the promiſe in an externall ſenſe. In which ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the general, ſaith, <hi>Of whom is the ſervice of God and the promiſes.</hi> In this ſenſe many were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not onely after the fleſh, but of the promiſe alſo; elſe circumciſion, the ſeal of the promiſe had not been applied to them: yet they were not the ſeed of the promiſe, in the ſenſe the Apoſtle intendeth, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was; that is, ſo as to have the true and real benefits of the promiſe; and in this reſpect we ſay, no ungodly man hath any promiſe of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge made to him, abiding in that condition. No promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, no promiſe of Gods favour, no promiſe of any earthly comfort, not a morſel of bread, or droppe of drinke; he cannot plead any promiſe
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:48709:307"/>
in his prayers. And therefore when we may enjoy many outward mercies, theſe come not by vertue of a promiſe to him, but onely through the providence of God, God out of a general love doth beſtow ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts upon him, it is not from any promiſe made to him. And indeed ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text ſaith, <hi>The promiſes of God are confirmed in Chriſt;</hi> unleſſe a man be in Chriſt, there is no promiſe can be effectual to him. Oh the ſad condition of all ungodly men! For if thou haſt no promiſe, what hope canſt thou have? Are not the Devils therefore eternally wretched, becauſe they have no promiſe? <hi>Hope</hi> in this is compared to an <hi>Anchor,</hi> Heb. 6. 19. Now what ſhipwrack muſt that ſhip needs endure, which under waves and tempeſts hath no Anchor for a defence?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods promiſe for the accompliſhing of it, doth ſuppoſe faith on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to us ſuppoſe faith in us.</note> 
                  <hi>our part; for the promiſe on Gods part, and faith on our part, are correlates.</hi> We cannot put forth faith for any mercy, where we have not Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; neither is Gods promiſe accompliſhed to any but the believer. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16. ſaith, <hi>The promiſe is of faith, that it might be not only by grace, but alſo made ſure to ſuch who do believe.</hi> So that it is with a godly man according to his faith. Chriſt saith to thee, <hi>Be thou juſtified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy faith;</hi> receive pardon and comfort according to thy faith. If thou complaineſt God hath made great and precious promiſes, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not taſte of this honey, I periſh notwithſtanding this fullneſſe: Then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it is not, becauſe there is not enough in the promiſe, but thy faith is weak, thy veſſel is narrow to receive: As if the woman ſhould have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to borrow veſſels, when the Prophet multiplied her oyle. For the oyl did not ceaſe, till her veſſels ceaſed: So neither will Gods promiſe ceaſe working, till thy faith ceaſe to operate. Indeed in Gods comminations and threatnings they are fulfilled, whether man will or no: Let him believe, or not believe, God will throw the ungodly into Hell; but in the promiſes it is otherwiſe; then they do good to us, when by faith we imbrace them. So that by this we ſee how dangerous and noxious it is, not to put forth faith; it both diſhonours God, and depriveth us of all good: it diſhonours God, as if he were not true, as if it were not impoſſible for him to lie, as if he were no more than a man. Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſaid, <hi>To give glory unto God by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> Rom. 4. 20. becauſe he did not regard the dead womb, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability in ſecond cauſes, but reſted upon the promiſe alone. If it be ſo hainous a matter to accuſe man of a lie, who yet is by nature a <hi>lyar,</hi> as the Scripture pronounceth of him, how unſufferable is it to attribute it unto God. And then it is a very deſtructive ſinne; for it evacuateth all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes as to us; it maketh thy condition as hopeleſſe, as if never any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes had been made: This is to cut the Conduit-pipes of all comfort and conſolation. This is with the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> as it were to throw earth into all the Wells of water. Therefore above all things look to thy faith, for it maketh God no God, Chriſt no Chriſt, promiſes no promiſes, as to thee.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That our faith may be the more confirmed, he is not onely pleaſed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. God hath ſealed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to us.</note> 
                  <hi>to make promiſes to his people, but alſo to give ſignes for the confirmation thereof.</hi> Therefore Sacraments are confirming ſignes of Gods promiſe, they are <hi>viſible promiſes:</hi> ſo that our unbelief will ſtill be the greater ſinne; if neither the promiſes nor the ſeales viſibly annexed thereunto, ſhall not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh us againſt all doubting and uncertainty. It is true, the Sacraments cannot make Gods word ſurer in it ſelf, but they do in reſpect of us, God graciouſly condeſcending to our humane weakneſſe: By which mercifull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of God, that his people might live a life of faith in his promiſe', we may gather as the neceſſity of faith, ſo alſo the great proneneſſe that is in
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:48709:307"/>
us to unbeliefe, that we rather live by ſenſe, than by ſaith. Hence it is that when we have outward ſupports and comforts, our hearts are kept up; but when all theſe leave us, are taken away, then like <hi>Peter</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water, we are afraid, and ſhould even ſinke, did not the Lord ſupport us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>It is therefore a very great skill to make uſe of the promiſes of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. 'Tis great skill to make uſe of promiſes</note> 
                  <hi>God by faith.</hi> It is the Goſpel-wiſdome, a myſtery it is, that even the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt are a long while ere they can learne it. For though God doth promiſe to doe ſuch and ſuch wonderfull things, yet he ſuffereth ſo many croſſe providences to fall out, that we would think God had wholly forgot his promiſe. Hence the Church complaineth; <hi>Doth his promiſes fail for ever?</hi> Yea the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth ſpeak of ſome prophane ſcoffers, that asked, <hi>Where was the promiſe of his coming?</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 4. becauſe they ſaw all things continue as they did, therefore they thought Gods promiſe was in vain. It behoveth the people of God therefore to acquaint themſelves with Gods Riddles, to plough with the Scriptures Heifer: for their unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe herein, is that which maketh them ſo full of dejections, which doth ſo often perplex them, not knowing what to think or ſay: yea they are apt to queſtion the truth and righteouſneſſe of God: but take heed of this, it is a very great ſinne, when God giveth thee a ſufficient teſtimony of his grace and favour to thee, by his promiſes and ſeals thereof, ſtill to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and doubt, whether God will doe it or no. This is grievouſly to tempt God, as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 7. who though they had ſo many miraculous diſcoveries of Gods preſence with them, yet ſtill they ask, <hi>Is the Lord amongst us, or not?</hi> Oh take heed of ſaying, Is the Lord mine? Will he do good to me? When he hath given proof enough, both by his promiſes, and ſeals, of his favour. Oh ſatisfie thy ſoul with this! Lord, I have thy promiſe, before thou promiſedſt, thou waſt free whether thou wouldſt do it or no; but ſince thy mouth hath promiſed it, how can thy hand but fulfill it? Let thy temptations, thy ſtraits be never ſo great, yet know the promiſe of God cannot be ſtraitned. Though thy friends die, though thy goods are loſt, yet Gods promiſe cannot die, neither can that periſh. And if thou ſayeſt. Oh but I am unworthy, I am a poor wretch! What then? Say, Lord though I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be helped, yet thy promiſe is worthy to be made good! O Lord, though I have ſinned, yet thy promiſe hath not ſinned! But more of this in the next particular, which is the Predicate in the Propoſition.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How all the Promiſes are confirmed in Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 COR. 1. 20.</bibl>
                  <q>For all the promiſes of God, in him are Yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HAving diſpatched the Subject in this Propoſition, we proceed to the Predicate, that which is affirmed of the <hi>promiſes of God;</hi> and that is their ſtability and immutability; they are <hi>Yea and Amen:</hi> with the meritorious or fundamental cauſe, <hi>[In him]</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Some indeed take the latter clauſe, <hi>viz. in him</hi> they are <hi>Amen,</hi> with relation to the final cauſe, and ſo explain it of our duty, that we are to ſet our <hi>Amen</hi> to the truth of Gods promiſes.</p>
               <p>In the former expreſſion is denoted the certainty and firmneſſe of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when they are ſaid to be <hi>Yea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter our duty, and what obligation lieth upon us in reference to them, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſhould ſet to our ſeal of <hi>Amen,</hi> giving our aſſent of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; and this will greatly redound to Gods glory. <hi>Calvin</hi> goeth in this latter explication, as being moſt congruous and adapted to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles meaning: Though he confeſſeth he will not be contentious, if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon path be trodden in. I ſhall therefore follow our Tranſlators, which ſeem to go the genuine way. It is affirmed of Gods promiſes, that they are <hi>Yea;</hi> by that you heard the Apoſtle meaneth a <hi>conſtant affirmation,</hi> and <hi>verity.</hi> Hath God promiſed any good thing to an humbled ſoule? This will alwayes be <hi>Yea;</hi> God will alwayes grant it, he will ſay <hi>Yea, yea.</hi> How comfortable would this meditation be to a gracious heart? How often doth thy trembling, deſponding ſoul go into his preſence, fearing that God will give a <hi>Nay</hi> to thee? Becauſe thou art apt to change, and to be mutable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou feareſt God will be ſo alſo.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle for the greater certainty ſake, doth double his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſame ſenſe, <hi>[In him they are Amen, In him they are Yea,] In him they are Amen.]</hi> The one is a <hi>Greek</hi> word, the other <hi>Hebrew:</hi> and it is to ſhew, that both to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> the promiſes are confirmed in Chriſt. For whereas the <hi>Jewes</hi> perſwaſion was, That the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come onely to their Nation; therefore the Apoſtles dared not to preach Chriſt to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till <hi>Peter</hi> was confirmed by a viſion from above. By Chriſt, this partition wall is broken down: ſo that the promiſes of grace are made to the believing <hi>Gentile,</hi> as well as the believing <hi>Jew.</hi> To the <hi>Gentile</hi> the promiſes are <hi>Yea:</hi> to the <hi>Jewes</hi> they are <hi>Amen.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Apoſtle alſo, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 6. ſpeaking of the Spirit of Adoption, which is ſent into the hearts of believers, addeth, <hi>That thereby we are enabled to
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:48709:308"/>
call him Abba, Father. Father</hi> for the <hi>Gentile, Abba</hi> for the <hi>Jew.</hi> So that whereas the believing <hi>Gentile</hi> might have doubted, whether he being as a dog, the childrens bread ſhould belong to him: Hereby is certified, that Chriſt is a Chriſt to them, the promiſes are promiſes to them as well as to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The word <hi>Amen</hi> is uſed ſometimes nominally. Thus Chriſt is called the <hi>Amen,</hi> Revel. 3. 14. <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Amen;</hi> well then may the promiſes be <hi>Amen</hi> in Chriſt, ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Amen.</hi> Sometimes it is uſed adverbially, and ſo is to be underſtood by way of deſire and wiſh, <hi>Let it be ſo;</hi> or by way of atteſtation and confirmation, <hi>It is ſo.</hi> Hence tranſlated by the Interpreters of the Old Teſtament, ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. When it beginneth a ſpeech, it is a note of <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as often our Saviour, <hi>Amen, Amen, I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c. When it concludeth, then it is a note of <hi>confirmation;</hi> and in this ſenſe <hi>Calvin</hi> and others take it, as our duty by way of conſent, confirming: the promiſe, as you heard. The <hi>Rabbines</hi> ſpeak of a two-fold <hi>Amen,</hi> a <hi>perfect Amen,</hi> and an <hi>imperfect.</hi> The <hi>imperfect Amen,</hi> they make three-fold, <hi>Amen Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillum,</hi> when one ſaith <hi>Amen</hi> to the prayer he doth not underſtand. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſubreptitium,</hi> when a man ſaith it before the end of a prayer. <hi>Amen ſectile,</hi> when a man ſaith <hi>Amen,</hi> but diſtracted and divided in his thoughts, ſo that he doth not attend to what he ſaith <hi>Amen.</hi> And certainly this latter <hi>Amen,</hi> moſt are guilty of that uſe to ſay it. The words being thus explained, the Obſervation is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in Chriſt alone all the promiſes of God are confirmed, and made</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In Chriſt alone are all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God confirmed and made good.</note> 
                  <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have alſo at another time aſſerted by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 15. 8. I ſay that Jeſus Chriſt was a Miniſter of circumciſion for the truth of God, to confirme the promiſes made unto the fathers, and that the Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercy.</hi> This is a notable place, which the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with much vehemency. <hi>This I ſay</hi> (and the matter is this) <hi>that by Chriſt all promiſes both to Jewes and Gentiles are confirmed.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> they were apt to thinke, that by their own workes the promiſes were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yea, how ſecretly doth this Phariſaical ſinne lodge in our breaſts, as if the promiſes were performed not for Chriſts ſake, but our own ſake? This is that Ivy-ſinne, which adhering ſo cloſe to our natures, doth ſecretly conſume and devour all. Inſomuch that we may ſay, the whole Goſpel conſiſteth in this truth, and that the whole treaſure of Chriſtian conſolation is bound up in this.</p>
               <p>And therefore that we may both underſtand, and be affected with it, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>By the promiſes of God we mean the promiſes of grace onely.</hi> There <note place="margin">1. By the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God here are meant only tis promiſes of grace.</note> is no grace to a ſinner, but through Chriſt; and hereby we exclude the promiſes by works, or the Covenant of works, of which we ſpake the laſt day. Although the Law doth continue ſtill in its force to us Chriſtians; as it is a Rule to order our converſation by, yet as it is a <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſo it is aboliſhed: No man being able to plead eternal life, by a <hi>Doe this</hi> but by <hi>believing;</hi> and therefore the Law as a <hi>Covenant,</hi> is ſo farre from, being eſtabliſhed or made good by Chriſt, that it is directly oppoſite to him. So that the Law and the promiſe are made by the Apoſtle two <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-</hi>diſtinct wayes of juſtification: He that ſeeketh to be juſtified by the Law, falleth off from Chriſt, and maketh him to be of none effect. Thus the promiſe by <hi>workes</hi> is contrary to the promiſe of <hi>grace</hi> through Chriſt; yet there have been ſome alwayes in the Church, who have endeavoured to
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:48709:309"/>
joyn thoſe things which God hath put ſo farre aſunder, and that is the Law and the Goſpel, the promiſe of works, and the promiſe of grace; by which confuſion they have made void the grace of God. For if Gods promiſe be not ſolely of the grace of God, and every way of grace, then it is not at all of grace, <hi>If of workes, then not of grace.</hi> It is the Apoſtles infallible argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. It cannot be of grace and workes alſo. <hi>Luther (Comment. in Geneſ.)</hi> maketh this properly <hi>Simony,</hi> when we would have Heaven for the workes we doe; and thereupon ſaith, <hi>Omnis homo naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſt Simoniacus.</hi> Now how neceſſary is this truth to be known by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humbled and afflicted ſinner? How difficultly is he brought to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace, as if it were the forbidden fruit, that he might not taſte of it? This was the precious gold that the firſt Reformers with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour digged out of the mines of the Scripture: it was the oyl they poured into wounded hearts. In what a wilderneſſe doth the child of God wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till he hath this pillar of fire to guide him? Peace and joy cannot be obtained, till he come to this promiſe of grace in Chriſt. How ſlaviſh, how ſervile is he; till he know that this onely is the way of juſtification, this onely is the way of pardon and acceptance with God? And Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, eſpecially while in the pangs of converſion, or at any time under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerlions and black fears about their eſtate, are to flie unto this, as a City of Refuge. Many an heavy temptation, many an heart-breaking doubt would be overcome, wert thou once perſwaded, that in the matter of juſtification, thou muſt know nothing, live upon nothing, but the gracious promiſe of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We are to diſtinguiſh of promiſes: they are either fulfilled in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Promiſes are fulfilled either in Chriſt or by him.</note> 
                  <hi>him, or fullfilled by him.</hi> For according to this diviſion, ſo ſome doe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently underſtand the Text. For there are Interpreters that make this the meaning, <hi>All the promiſes, viz.</hi> which have of old beene fore-told by the Prophets, they were all <hi>Yea and Amen in him,</hi> that is, <hi>They were all fullfilled in him;</hi> and in this ſenſe all the promiſes are true, <hi>in him, ut ſubjecto.</hi> But then others, they ſay, not onely the promiſes of the Old Teſtament, but of the New alſo, they are ſure <hi>in him,</hi> becauſe through his worth and dignity they are accompliſhed; and thus the promiſes of God are <hi>Yea in him, ut fundamento, &amp; causâ meritoriâ.</hi> But we are not to oppoſe theſe interpretations. For if we take the promiſes of both kinds, they may well be applied to the Text: Yea the latter do neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the former: The former is to ſupport our aſſenting faith; the other, our ſiducial faith. For the firſt, we read of many promiſes in the Old Teſtament, concerning a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to come: and theſe were all accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that perſon, <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> The firſt promiſe that was made concerning him, is <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3. 15. where he is promiſed, <hi>As the ſeed of the woman that ſhould deſtroy the ſeed of the Serpent.</hi> Afterwards he is more particularly promiſed, <hi>As the ſeed of Abraham in whom all Nations ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> which the Apoſtle doth induſtriouſly apply to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>Chriſt onely,</hi> Galat. 3. 16. So that we may ſay, the promiſe made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> are fullfilled in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are <hi>Yea and Amen in him.</hi> Thus alſo the promiſe of a <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the promiſe of a <hi>great Prophet whom God would raiſe up,</hi> the promiſe of a <hi>King, who ſhould ſit upon Davids threne, and of his Kingdome there ſhould be no end.</hi> The promiſe of a <hi>Meſſias</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> were all <hi>yea in Chriſt.</hi> When he came into the world, we might truly ſay, <hi>Behold the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, behold Abrahams ſeed, behold Davids King, Jacobs Shiloh, Daniels Meſſiah.</hi> Yea the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who is juſtly called the <hi>fifth Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,</hi> becauſe he doth as plainly and clearly ſpeak of Chriſt, as the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi>
                  <pb n="593" facs="tcp:48709:309"/>
doe, All his promiſes concerning him, eſpecially in <hi>Chap. 9. 6. To us a Childe is borne, to us a Sonne is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder.</hi> As alſo <hi>Chap. 7. 14. Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive and beare a Sonne, and ſhall call his Name Immanuel.</hi> But chiefly <hi>Chap.</hi> 53. where at large his ſufferings are fore-told for our ſinnes, <hi>That he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities, and that by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> All theſe are made evidently <hi>Yea and Amen in him.</hi> And not onely the promiſes, but all the Levitical adminiſtrations, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, the <hi>Scape-Goat,</hi> the <hi>whole burnt Offering,</hi> the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> theſe were types of Chriſt, and were <hi>Yea in him;</hi> which made <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſay, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world, John</hi> 1. 29. Now the conſideration of this ſerveth greatly to confirme our faith againſt <hi>Jewes,</hi> who blaſpheme the Lord Chriſt, cavilling that thoſe promiſes could not be applied to him, and therefore they doe expect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Neither doth the uſefullneſſe of this truth ſtay there, but when it hath perſwaded us of the true dogmatical faith, then it further inclineth us to a fiducial recumbency and repoſing of our ſoules upon him, as our <hi>Prophet,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> as our <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is to bring us into reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God. And this ſenſe of the Text we are to acknowledge; but then the other, which floweth from this, is, <hi>That in Chriſt all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God to his Church are confirmed, they have their vertue and efficacy from him.</hi> Without Chriſt there could not have been ſuch promiſes made, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without him could they have been accompliſhed, as may appear in the third particular; which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the promiſes being the ſignes of Gods grace and favour, there could</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. There could have been no promiſes without Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>neither have beene the exiſtency of promiſes, or the fullfilling of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe of that infinite holineſſe which is in God, whereby he cannot but loath ſinners, and his glorious Attribute of Juſtice, whereby he is carried out to puniſh every ſuch offender. This Juſtice of God cauſeth ſuch a great gulfe between us and God, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a gracious promiſe can come to us, or we to it, till by the blood of Chriſt, this juſtice be atoned, and a ſufficient expiation made by his blood. No wonder then if all Goſpel-promiſes are ſaid to be made <hi>in him,</hi> becauſe the leaſt good thing promiſed could never be vouchſafed to us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſts mediation: There could not be remiſſion of ſin, there could not be accepting of our perſons, there could not be the leaſt drop of any bleſſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us, had not Chriſt as our Surety interpoſed. Therefore it is not the promiſe, but Chriſt in the promiſe, that the ſoul is by faith to receive. The <hi>Ens incomplexum,</hi> not <hi>Complexum,</hi> is <hi>Objectum fidei,</hi> ſaith the learned. The promiſe or propoſition is onely <hi>Objectum quo;</hi> Chriſt, or the matter promiſed, is the <hi>Objectum quod.</hi> In all promiſes then we are ſtill to have our eye upon Chriſt, as without whom they could not have any efficacy at all. So that as it is with the creatures, they all ſubſiſt by his power, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being:</hi> And if God ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his arme, they would all fall into nothing. Thus it is with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes recorded in the Scripture, they all move and act (as it were) <hi>in him;</hi> They all live, and worke in him; were it nor for his merit, and his Spirit, they would be but as empty words, or as a tinkling cymball. Therefore</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, <hi>The Covenant of Grace, which is virtually all the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the covenant of grace called a teſtament.</note> 
                  <hi>promiſes of God, it is not onely called a Covenant, and a Promiſe, but a Teſtament likewiſe.</hi> And that for this end, becauſe it doth neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to the death of the Teſtatour: So that Gods promiſe is not to be conceived, as when one man maketh a promiſe to another abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:48709:310"/>
and without any thing intervening. For here we have God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed promiſing from his meer abſolute goodneſſe and mercy: but then the execution of this cannot be without the blood of Chriſt: ſo that all the force of the promiſe ariſeth from the death of Chriſt. The Apoſtle therefore argueth the validity of this Covenant from that, which is amongſt men, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>A mans testament when it is confirmed, cannot be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled or added unto; how much rather then muſt the teſtament of Chriſt be confirmed for ever?</hi> The Apoſtle doth excellently conſider this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. For this cauſe Chriſt is a <hi>Mediatour of the New Teſtament, that by meanes of death,—they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. For where a teſtament is, there alſo muſt of neceſſity be the death of the teſtatour.</hi> By which it appeareth, that the promiſes of God are eſtabliſhed upon a ſure and unchangeable foundation, even the blood of Chriſt: and therefore as ſure as Chriſt died, ſo ſure will thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God be made effectual to thee. Indeed if Gods promiſes were <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> according to thy workes, to thy worth and dignity, woe would be unto thee. Yea, though God doth require faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet the promiſes are not ſetled upon theſe, as a foundation, but on Chriſt; and therefore it is, that our hopes, our comforts can never be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The promiſes then of God have <hi>two Pillars</hi> to bear them up, though one be enough: The firſt is, <hi>The immutability and verity of Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> he cannot change, he cannot lie. The other is, <hi>From the Merit and Efficacy of Chriſts death,</hi> whereby the things promiſed are deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that at a dear rate, even Chriſts blood. Now then can any god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoule, give way to unbeliefe, to ſinfull dejections, ſeeing that God cannot lie, and the blood of Chriſt cannot but obtaine, God cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelfe, neither can he deny his onely Sonne? Therefore let the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoule remember this, Gods promiſe is not onely a bare promiſe, but Chriſts Teſtament alſo: Inſomuch that all ſpirituall benefits are the fruit of his death; and ſhall we thinke that blood will be ſhed in vain? Shall we give no more to Chriſts Teſtament, then we will to a mans? But this Doctrine deſerveth further enlarging.</p>

               <p>ALl the promiſes of grace, you have heard, are eſtabliſhed upon two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable pillars, Gods unchangableneſſe, and the bloud of Chriſt. To proceed from this, followeth Firſt, That <hi>Deus abſolutus,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, or <hi>Deus in praedicamento ſubſtantiae,</hi> is a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> and we are nothing but ſtubble before him: it muſt be God as <hi>in praedicamento relationis,</hi> as he is <hi>a God promiſing mercy unto us in Chriſt;</hi> that is the ground of all our commerce and fellowſhip with him. We are not to appear before God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of our obedience to his commands, but by faith in his promiſes: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the only foundation we have to build upon in all our approaches unto him, is Gods promiſe alone in Chriſt. The godly ſoul is to look with as much or more chearfulneſſe on that, than <hi>Rahab</hi> could do on the ſcarlet thread held out, as a commemorative ſigne to preſerve her life: were it not for this promiſe in Chriſt, who could, who might, who dare draw nigh to God the Father? So that it is through Chriſt that the way is opened for us to come unto God. We may ſee this notably prefigured, as it were in Gods diſpenſation with the people of <hi>Iſrael, Exo.</hi> 33. 2, 3. for when they had by their ſinnes greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, the Lord denied his preſence to go along with them: <hi>I will not go up with thee, leſt I conſume thee in the way:</hi> this ſheweth, that ſuch was Gods anger againſt their iniquity that he could not bear it; It's a ſpeech taken from the humour of men, otherwiſe the anger of the Lord is ſubject to his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, only this is ſpoken to ſhew what diſtaſtefull objects they were to him; But though his anger be thus againſt them, yet ſee what he promiſeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>I will ſend my Angel before thee:</hi> Here God would not go, but his Angel, now this Angel is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as appeareth <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 20, 21, 22. where he is deſcribed as one, in whoſe power it is to pardon iniquities, with this addition, <hi>for my Name is in him.</hi> Obſerve then here a ſweet Oeconomy or diſpenſation of Gods dealing with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a Preſident to inform us about all mankinde; God would not look upon mankinde, neither would he behold, as it were, if he did, he ſhould immediatly deſtroy them all; but he ſends an Angel, he ſendeth Chriſt into the world, and ſo in and through him he becomes propitious to us: Now how little is this underſtood by Chriſtians, who do go to the promiſes upon their own obedience? they think they beleeve, they repent, and in the mean while Chriſt is not all in all, as if in our graces, in our performances: The promiſes of God were <hi>yea and Amen,</hi> and not in God himſelf: It is a long while ere the miniſtery of the Law hath any efficacy upon mens hearts, ere
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:48709:311"/>
they are ſenſible of the weight and the heavineſſe of ſinne, ere they go bowed down becauſe of this burden; and when that hath broken them, it is many times longer ere they are directed to an Evangelicall life, ere they can tell how to make uſe of the proper remedy, which is the promiſe of God in Chriſt; for all their diſputes and doubts ariſe from this, as if the fullfilling of the promiſes were eſtabliſhed upon themſelves, and not upon Chriſts bloud. Truly if the humbled ſinner were well inſtructed in this principle, it would be like the riſing of the Sunne, to diſpell all darkneſſe, for either the promiſes are made good becauſe of thy faith, and of thy repentance, or becauſe of Chriſts bloud and atonement through that; if becauſe of the former, then no wonder thou art no more quieted in thy minde, no wonder thy heart is ſo full of fears: for how weak is thy faith? how ſtrong and heavy is thy heart? if thou muſt be juſtified by their worth, thou art undone. But then if Chriſt be the ſurety, if he hath undertaken for thee, and performed for thee what was required by the Law, then thou maiſt pleade, though not for my ſake, yet for Chriſts ſake let thy promiſe be made good to me.</p>
               <p>But the troubled ſoul will object very plauſibly againſt this, Though Gods promiſes are made good in Chriſt, yet there is the duty of faith and repentance required of me, ſo that if I do not beleeve, if I do not repent, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe through Chriſts blood eſtabliſhed, that will do me any good: what? is it your meaning, that though I am a ſinner, and while I abide in my ſins, I ſhould pleade the promiſe of God in Chriſt? Is not this to daſh my ſoul at the <hi>Antinomian</hi> rock? This deſerveth a full anſwer.</p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>It muſt be acknowledged, that in this point it is hard to ſail between</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is hard to ſail between the Arminian and Antinomian rock.</note> 
                  <hi>the Scylla and Charybdis of the Arminian errour on one hand, and Antinomian on the other ſide.</hi> For the <hi>Arminians</hi> they indeed make Chriſt to be the atonement for our ſins, but ſo that we muſt beleeve and repent, all which is true. But then if it be asked, how come we to beleeve, and to repent? here they fly, in part at leaſt; to our own free will, for they deny that faith is purchaſed by Chriſts death; ſo that by their doctrine the whole fruit of Chriſts death ſtandeth ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe and indeterminate, till it be determined by our faith. Chriſts death is made effectuall to us by our beleeving; and this beleeving is not wrought in us by Chriſts Spirit, nor is it beſtowed on us as the fruit of his death, but only we joyning with the grace of God do make the redimibility which was before faith, by faith to be actual redemption. And the <hi>Papiſt</hi> he erreth more groſly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for he addeth further, that our faith and repentance, yea, all holy works are cauſal conditions, ſuch as are meritorious, and have an inward condignity and proportion to the reward. Thus generally the Papiſts, though ſome of them deny this merit and cauſality; But the <hi>Antinomian</hi> falleth into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extremity, for he doth ſo offer Chriſt and his promiſes to a man, as if nothing at all were required on mans part, and therefore tels a ſinner that it is his duty while a ſinner, and abiding in that ſtate, to receive the promiſe; yea, one goeth ſo far <note n="*" place="margin">Saltmarſh.</note> as to ſay, that Chriſt did beleeve for us, Chriſt did repent for us, and therefore that we are not bound to beleeve or repent, but only to reſt on Chriſt that he hath done theſe things for us. Thus you ſee, here are two extreme opinions, and it is very hard for the ſoul in its firſt troubles and pangs to be guided out of this wilderneſſe: how many have been ſeduced by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> errours, under the ſpecious pretence of free grace? and how many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain have fallen into <hi>Armintan</hi> and Popiſh principles, thinking that way to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage their bleeding hearts? but the Scripture truth doth lie between theſe two; for Chriſt, and ſo the promiſes, are not applicable to ſinners as ſinners, whether they beleeve or not beleeve, whether they repent or not repent, but do require indiſpenſably of all grown perſons faith and repentance; but yet on the other ſide, this faith and repentance of ours, have no merit or dignity in them, nor
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:48709:311"/>
are they the effect and fruit of our own will and power, but are the gifts of Gods grace, and the conſequent of Chriſts death, ſo that Chriſt did not only die for our ſins, he did not only dye to confirm the promiſes to us, but he died alſo to give us faith and repentance, that by them we might be qualified ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for ſuch glorious mercies. Hence the Scripture maketh faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be the gifts of Gods grace, as well as remiſſion and pardon of ſinne. Theſe duties then are neceſſarily required of us, that the promiſes may be made good to us, againſt the <hi>Antinomians;</hi> yet theſe duties are Gods gift, and the work of his ſpirit, not the iſſues of our free-will; againſt the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, <hi>when a Chriſtian cometh to make uſe of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. A Chriſtian in making uſe of a promiſe muſt not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to Chriſt, nor Chriſt to it.</note> 
                  <hi>he muſt not oppoſe Chriſt and his duties, but compoſe them together:</hi> he muſt ſubordinate his duties to Chriſt. We complain that the Popiſh doctrines oppoſe Chriſt and duties, even as the Apoſtle argueth againſt the <hi>Galathians, who by works of the Law made Chriſt of none effect:</hi> and we cannot deny but the heart of man is ſo prone to put confidence in what we do, and although we diſclaim the merit of works, yet to have a ſecret reſt of the ſoul upon them, that it is very difficult to keep within our bounds, but yet we are alſo to know that every thing in Chriſtianity is very hard to fleſh and bloud. Any thing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly done, is exact, and accurately commenſurated to the rule of God: whereas ſuch is the inſtability and unrulineſſe of man naturally, that he is apt to run from one extreme to another, and while he ſeeketh to avoid one, to fall into another: our duty therefore is, to reſt upon Chriſt alone in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as the meritorious and fundamentall cauſe, yet diligently to purſue after holineſſe, as that which qualifieth the ſubject for the glorious things promiſed: God hath required theſe duties of thee, therefore be thou as faithful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the performance of them, as if there were no Chriſt, no Mediatour: And again, be thou as wholly recumbent on Chriſt, as if thou hadſt no faith, no repentance at all; diſtinguiſh between the neceſſary preſence of them, and the cauſality of them. Thus it ought to be the wiſedome and skill of Miniſters ſo to preach and exalt Chriſt, as thereby no duties are to be omitted or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And again ſo powerfully and exactly to preſſe duties, that Chriſt be not in the leaſt manner diſrobed of his glory; for although Chriſt interpoſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fathers wrath and us, yet you muſt not ſo underſtand it, as if by our ſins we could not provoke Chriſt; as if through our unbeleef and impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we might not cauſe him of a lamb to be like a roaring lion: We muſt not apprehend Chriſt to have only mercy in him, and all wrath to be in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only: for obſerve that counſel given to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this Angel, who was to guide them, which is Chriſt, <hi>Exod. 23. 21. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not, for my Name is in him.</hi> Though then the promiſes are eſtabliſhed upon Chriſt, yet take heed of provoking him by impenitency, for even Chriſt will be a judge againſt thee becauſe of thy diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: Well, let all this be granted, yet ſtill the tender and broken heart will object: I dare not lay hold on the promiſes, they do not belong to me; I finde ſo much unworthineſſe, ſo much dulneſſe and ſtupidity, that though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">What a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to do in his doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the promiſes. 1. He is not to aſcend into the high points of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> may pleade the promiſe, yet my heart is ſo full of fears and confuſion, that I dare not do it. What therefore ſhould a Chriſtian, doubting whether the promiſes do belong to him, do in that darkneſſe and perplexity which is upon him?</p>
               <p>And firſt, we grant, <hi>That a Christian ſo exerciſed, is not to aſcend up to thoſe high points of predeſtination, or the univerſal redemption by Chriſts death.</hi> We do not require of thee to aſcend up into heaven, as it were, to ſearch into the Book of life, whether thy Name be written there, and then to ſay, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe belongs to thee. This abſurd and prepoſterous courſe ſome would faſten upon thoſe, who hold the doctrine of Gods abſolute election; as if from that
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:48709:312"/>
it did neceſſarily follow, that no Chriſtian humbled for ſin might apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, till they firſt know whether they be elected or no. And again, thoſe that pleade for <hi>Univerſall redemption by Chriſt,</hi> they think, that unleſſe that be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, we cannot rationally perſwade any humbled ſinner to apply a particular promiſe to himſelf, that Chriſt loved him, and gave himſelf for him; but no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſinner is to run to any of theſe doctrines, but is out of the ſence of his unworthineſſe, to go as boldly to Chriſt in the promiſe, as if none of thoſe doctrines had ever been diſputed by learned men.</p>
               <p>For in the ſecond place, <hi>We are to make Gods commands and invitations the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. He ſhould make Gods command and invitation his ground of drawing nigh to a promiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>ground of our drawing nigh to the promiſe.</hi> If then the Scripture be full of ſuch gracious invitations to all that are hungry and thirſty, to all that are humbled and debaſed under their unworthineſſe, to come and finde reſt for their ſouls; yea, if the Scripture commands ſuch as are poor in ſpirit, with all holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to draw nigh to the throne of grace, then here is their warrant, from this, they are to encourage themſelves; ſo that the truly humbled ſinner is only to hearken what the word of God commands.

Never then perplex thy ſelf about theſe thoughts, whether the promiſes of God belong to thee or no; for it's plain, They belong to ſuch who are ſick under the ſence of ſinne, who are burthened under the weight of it; and if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes belong not to ſuch as thou art, they belong to none in the world: and withall ſet this home upon thy ſoul, that the longer thou keepeſt off from the promiſe, the worſe it is with thee; the work of faith will be the more difficult; the longer thou ſuffereſt this wound to feſter, the more difficultly will it be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: The longer thou wandreſt in this wilderneſſe, the more hard it will be at laſt to enter into <hi>Canaan:</hi> the longer the water is muddied, the harder will it be to ſee the face. For when all is done, and thou haſt diſputed thy ſelf out of breath, thou muſt come to this at laſt, even to lay hold upon the promiſe by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application, Shall <hi>Eſther</hi> reſolve to go into the Kings preſence, though no Scepter of Invitation were held out, ſaying, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh?</hi> how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable then wilt thou be if thou draweſt back, when the Scepter is held out? No wonder if <hi>Adam</hi> did run from God, endeavouring to hide himſelf from his preſence upon his tranſgreſſion; for as yet he had received no promiſe from God. But how wilt thou pleade for thy ſelf, when the promiſe is indefinitely propounded <hi>to every one that findeth the need thereof?</hi> This is certain, it is inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ruine to run from the promiſe; where wilt thou help thy ſelf, if thou flyeſt from it? There is no other way, but this Ark to eſcape drowning: Therefore remember, it is not diſputing, but reſting of thy ſoul on Chriſt, that will at laſt quiet thy ſpirit.</p>

For God can no more break his promiſe, than he can ceafe to be God; and truly herein the heart of a godly man ſhould greatly rejoyce.

firm as the promiſes; I deſire my ſoul may be <hi>Yea and Amen</hi> as well as they are. Oh how full is the Scripture of ſweet and comfortable promiſes? But we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and deſolate, not at all attending to them; ſo that it is with us, as <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> fancied about the heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> that they made moſt admirable muſick in their motion, but our ears through continuall uſe are ſtupified, and hear them not. To be ſure, the Scripture vouchſafeth excellent muſick and raviſhing joy to a gracious heart, but that many times attendeth not to it. But you may ſay, If this be ſo, that God breaketh not his promiſe, how ſhall we underſtand that place, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 34? where God threatning the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt them, and that their carcaſes ſhould fall in the wilderneſſe; then ſaith God, <hi>ye ſhall know my breach of promiſe,</hi> or as in the margin, <hi>my altering of my purpoſe.</hi> Here it ſhould ſeem God may break his promiſe: to this it may be anſwered, if we follow this Tranſlation, that God ſpeaketh of that particular promiſe about their entring into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was conditionall, if they did not rebell againſt him; and ſo they not fullfilling the condition, God is there ſaid to break his promiſe. But others render the Hebrew word other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as ſome tranſlate it, <hi>ultionem meam, my revenge:</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuathi,</hi> cometh of <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>break;</hi> and as it is applyed to words and promiſes, ſo alſo to other things; and therefore the moſt genuine tranſlation is <hi>abruptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem meam,</hi> you ſhall know my breaking, that is as ſome, that diſobedience whereby you have broken your ſelves from me; or elſe, which is moſt probable, that breaking which I have made upon you, becauſe of your ſins; you ſhall know I have divided my ſelf from you for your iniquites; and this I conceive moſt genuine.</p>
               <p>The Uſe is of Inſtruction: would we ever have the promiſes of God fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us, then the way is to get an intereſt in Chriſt; the promiſes are fullfilled in him, and therefore without Chriſt, without the promiſes. He is the heir, and therefore contrary to thoſe in the Parable; Let us not kill him, but obey him, and receive him for our Lord, and then the inheritance will be ours. Canſt thou upon good grounds ſay, Chriſt is mine? then thou maiſt alſo ſay, all the promiſes are mine: but know Chriſt cannot be thine upon any other terms than by forſaking all thy ſins, though never ſo pleaſant and profitable: Chriſt cannot be thine, unleſſe you leave every thing elſe for him. This is the pearl that we muſt ſell all to make ours; and truly no tongue is able to expreſſe, or heart to conceive the deſperate condition of thoſe, to whom no promiſe of grace doth belong: they are herein like the damned in hell. It is true, in your extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in your terrours, you will call for mercy, cry out for pardon; but where is the Chriſt, in whoſe name this is to be obtained? Certainly if Chriſt be yours, the ſpirit of Chriſt alſo, ſubduing your luſts and ſins for you.</p>

               <p>WE are now arrived at the finall cauſe or end of <hi>Gods promiſes,</hi> and their confirmation in Chriſt, which is ſaid to be <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and that <hi>by us.</hi> The Miniſters of the Goſpel are the inſtruments who do offer theſe promiſes, and ſo God is glorified by their miniſterial labours.

                  </gap>, expounding it in this ſence, that it is the glory of the Miniſters of the Goſpel to proclaim the year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time of Gods promiſes; but that is not ſo probable. Some alſo, as we have formerly hinted, reade it thus; and therefore in him <hi>is Amen, to the glory of God.</hi> Thus the Vulgar Latine, and one Manuſcript Greek copy, which <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> doth commend, calling that connexion we have, <hi>frigida, a frigid and cold one;</hi> whereas this doth notably diſcover the duty of all beleevers, that they are to ſet to their <hi>Amen</hi> as a Seal to Gods Promiſes: and certainly it is a bleſſed thing for the people of God to be nouriſhed up in the Evangelicall <hi>Amen.</hi> We do with more eaſe uſe the word <hi>Amen optatively, Let it be ſo,</hi> then <hi>confirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, So it is.</hi> For if we did give our <hi>Amen</hi> in this latter ſence to the promiſes, our hearts would have full quietneſſe and ſerenity after our prayers: when we had caſt our burthen upon the Lord, then we ſhould no more diſquiet our ſelves with doubting thoughts, whether the Lord will fullfill his promiſes or no. So that this <hi>Amen</hi> would exclude all <hi>ergo's,</hi> all arguings and doubtful diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we are apt to moleſt our ſelves with. Now although we ſhall not follow thoſe copies that reade it ſo, yet that ſence muſt neceſſarily be included; for then are promiſes to Gods glory, when they are beleeved and received by us. Let us then ſeriouſly conſider the end of Gods promiſes; why hath he taken ſuch a full and ſure way for beleevers? The Text telleth us, it is <hi>for the glory of God;</hi> we would think the promiſes had this rather for their end, to bring ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to us; and ſo indeed that is a ſubordinate end, but the Apoſtle he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanceth in the principall and chiefeſt end of all, which is Gods glory. And therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> doth well obſerve upon this Text, that this is a ſure argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevail with God in our Petitions, for the accompliſhment of Gods promiſes; for though he might neglect our ſalvation, yet he will not his own glory, ſaith he: though thy happineſſe be no argument, yet his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will be a motive to prevail: ſo that the words then afford this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                  <hi>to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we beleeve Promiſes, we do not only advantage our ſelves, but we alſo glorifie God: This is not ſufficiently thought of, for we are apt to look upon faith in a Promiſe as that which is for our comfort, our profit only, and do not attend that. hereby alſo we do exceedingly glorifie God. Hence <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is ſaid, <hi>Rom. 4. 20. to be ſtrong in faith, giving glory unto God:</hi> That the uſefulneſſe of this doctrine may appear, we will conſider the Promiſes, firſt on Gods part who promiſeth them, and ſhew how this maketh to the great glory of God, and then on the beleevers part, while he giveth his <hi>Amen</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>And for the firſt, <hi>Gods glory is exceedingly manifeſted in promiſes, by theſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wherein the glory of God is manifeſted in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. 1. Hereby his goodneſſe is known.</note> 
                  <hi>particularly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby his bounty and goodneſſe is made known.</hi> The Lord, as you heard; formerly, was infinitely ſufficient in his own ſelf: Nothing can adde to the bleſſedneſſe of God, no more than a feather can to the weight of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Had God created no world, or creatures therein, he had been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happy in himſelf when he made the creatures: It was not for that end that <hi>Eve</hi> was to <hi>Adam,</hi> to be a meet help to him; No, it was his plentifull goodneſs, for <hi>bonum quo melius, eo magis diffuſivum.</hi> God is ſaid indeed <hi>to make all things for himſelf,</hi> he is the end of all: but as <hi>Leſſius the Jeſuite</hi> expreſſeth it, he is not <hi>finis indigentiae,</hi> but <hi>aſſimilationis;</hi> not an end of indigency; as if he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any thing by us, but an end of <hi>aſſimilation</hi> and perfection, whereby he would reduce the rationall creatures to his own likeneſſe: we may then with enlarged hearts admire the goodneſſe of God in all his promiſes: Hath the Lord promiſed to be gracious, to pardon ſin, to ſanctifie and ſubdue corruptions, give glory to God in all theſe things: Be like a <hi>David,</hi> a ſweet ſinger of the praiſes of God, thou maiſt reade in every promiſe the glorious attribute of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and bounty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As we may ſee <hi>the glory of his goodneſſe in promiſes, ſo alſo the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. His love.</note> 
                  <hi>of his love:</hi> We may there reade how great his affections are to us, he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aſide as it were his abſolute Majeſty, his terrible greatneſſe, and condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth to deal with us in a way of promiſe; he giveth us leave by this to have confident and familiar converſe with him: ſo that as it was the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love of God to become man for our ſakes; thus alſo it is to become in promiſe to us: ſo that whereas the Majeſty of God might affright us, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and threatnings might amaze us. Now his promiſes they give us encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and we are with <hi>Moſes</hi> admitted as it were to ſpeak to God <hi>face to face,</hi> as one familiar friend to another; he giveth us the key when he maketh a promiſe, to come into his chamber of preſence when we will, or to go in his wine-cellar for all ſpirituall refreſhments: when you come with a promiſe, you have a <hi>mandamus</hi> as it were for every door to open to you, and to receive you in: Theſe promiſes of God, like <hi>Peters</hi> Angel, doth break up all the ſtrong bars of any priſon we are in; any difficulty we are afflicted with: As <hi>Dalilah</hi> gathered <hi>Sampſon</hi> loved her, when he would manifeſt where his ſtrength was, ſo may we aſſure our ſelves of Gods love to us, by revealing his promiſes; oh if you bring the promiſes, you binde the hands as it were of the Almighty, he can do nothing againſt his promiſes: when therefore any thoughts of Gods Majeſty, of Gods purity and holineſſe, may affright thee, run to his promiſe; and as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when amazed, under the terrible lightnings and thundrings at Gods preſence, in giving the Law cried out, <hi>Let not God ſpeak
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:48709:314"/>
any more to us but Moſes:</hi> ſo do thou: let not thy Majeſty ſpeak, thy Juſtice ſpeak, thy Holineſſe ſpeak, but thy <hi>Promiſe,</hi> let that ſpeak, and we will hear.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The freeneſſe of Gods grace</hi> is made very glorious and reſplendent in <note place="margin">3. The free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his grace.</note> the promiſes of grace: <hi>Free-grace</hi> is more than love or goodneſſe and bounty. for <hi>Adam</hi> while in the ſtate of integrity had thoſe, but <hi>free-grace</hi> is only where a miſerable and hopeleſſe ſinner is: Now to ſuch an one belong only curſes and threatnings: when therefore in ſtead of a threatning like a roaring lion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thee, thou meeteſt with a gracious promiſe to embrace thee, this muſt needs rejoyce thy heart: Go to the ſpring head of every promiſe, and thou wilt finde it to be alone <hi>free-grace.</hi> The Scripture uſeth theſe Arguments as equivalent, to have a thing by grace, to have it by a promiſe, and to have it by faith, for grace is the originall and fountain: Promiſes are on Gods part the active and communicative means, faith on our part is the receptive and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicative; ſo that when we enjoy any mercy by Gods promiſe, thereby is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all works and all boaſting, and thus God is altogether exalted and man debaſed.</p>
               <p>Again, if we come to the ſecond particular, there we ſhall ſee how that our <hi>Amen,</hi> ſubſcribed to the promiſes, or our firm beleeving in them, doth give glory to God: and this is the more to be preſſed, becauſe we are apt to have low thoughts of faith; as we ſee in Popery, where Charity is far preferred before it, and withall, to beleeve is accounted an eaſie thing: Thus alſo the Papiſts charge us, as if we made the way to heaven a broad way, becauſe we ſay, they muſt beleeve, that is the ſoul and life of all. And further, it is good to preſſe this, becauſe the people of God look upon <hi>faith</hi> (as was hinted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) only as their eaſe, not as bringing any glory to God: Hence, though they never doubt whether they ſhould repent of ſinne, or love God, yet they do very much doubt about their duty of beleeving. Now all this prepoſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ariſeth from the want of conſideration in this particular, that <hi>Faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth glory to God</hi> as well as procureth mercies to our ſelves, yea, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in the promiſe is the great and ſignall eminent way of <hi>giving glory to God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How faith in Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes gives glory to him? 1. Hereby we acknowledge our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe by beleeving in Gods promiſes, <hi>we thereby proclaim our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon him in all things,</hi> that we live both ſpiritually and corporally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him only; ſo that faith in this conſideration is the great duty of the firſt commandment, That requireth us we ſhould have no other Gods beſides him: Thus faith doth, it taketh off from all ſupports of ſence of ſecond cauſes, of all humane advancements, and ſetleth us upon the promiſe of God alone: Now muſt not this needs <hi>give glory to God,</hi> when God alone is ſet up, no creature, no other help is looked upon; This is that which maketh faith in the promiſes ſo difficult, becauſe it is ſo hard to be wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the breaſts of the creature: we know not how to ſwimme with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe bladders; Though we have ten thouſand promiſes to ſupport us, yet one croſſe providence doth more to unſettle us, then all theſe promiſes to confirm and quiet us; Some have obſerved, that all the letters in the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> are <hi>literae quiefcentes,</hi> teaching us thereby to reſt our ſouls alone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, it may be that is too curious, howſoever faith may be called the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcent</hi> or <hi>quietative grace;</hi> therefore to beleeve in the promiſes is to <hi>give glory to God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By beleeving in the promiſes we glorifie God, becauſe <hi>hereby we</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Hereby we manifeſt him to be the truth it ſelf.</note> 
                  <hi>manifeſt him to be truth it ſelf,</hi> the ſupream and infallible truth, Therefore the Scripture maketh the contrary to this a very hainous ſinne, highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring God, as when it is ſaid, <hi>John 3. 33. He that receiveth the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Chriſt</hi> (which is by faith) <hi>hath ſet to his ſeal, that God is true:</hi>
                  <pb n="603" facs="tcp:48709:314"/>
Then on the contrary, he that doth not receive it, he ſetteth to his ſeal, that God is a lyar: Oh execrable blaſphemy, ſo much unbeleef is ſo much giving the lye to God; and if this be ſo hainous a ſinne, then beleeving doth God as much honour. And truly it muſt be unpardonable, if we who do upon a mans promiſe reſt our ſelves contented, and never doubt of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; eſpecially when a juſt and honeſt man; that we ſhould not much rather rely upon God, of whom the Scripture ſaith, <hi>It is impoſſible he ſhould lye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Herein doth beleeving in <hi>Gods promiſe</hi> ſo exceedingly glorifie <note place="margin">3. Hereby we exalt Gods way of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> God, <hi>becauſe it exalteth that Evangelicall way of our juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which God above all things purpoſed for his own glory.</hi> The works of Creation are for the demonſtration of Gods glory: <hi>Whether we eat or drink, we are to do all for the glory of God.</hi> But the way of mans ſalvation is in a more ſignall and eminent manner ordered for Gods glory. This is the myſtery that hath aſtoniſhed all the world; This is that glorious truth which the Angels deſire to ſearch into more and more; Now by faith this glory of God is publiſhed and acknowledged. Take the deſpairing ſinner, look upon the damned in hell, do they give God the glory of his grace, and of his wiſedom and mercy? Do they with cordiall raviſhments ſpeak of the unſearchable riches of Gods grace in Chriſt? No, they cannot do it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Beleever only is he who giveth God the glory due to him for all Goſpel-wayes, and all Evangelicall Priviledges. Therefore hath God exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith above all its fellow-graces, becauſe that above all graces doth give God the glory due to him. Indeed in the ſtate of Integrity, their love of God had the preheminence, as it ſhall alſo have in Heaven; but in the ſtate of grace, there Faith hath the Excellency: God hath taken off the royal Crown from that <hi>Vaſthi,</hi> and put it upon this <hi>Eſther,</hi> this deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable grace, as it were, and which hath no Pomp at all in it; Only as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>who being poor made many rich;</hi> So this poor grace doth not onely enrich us, but every way advanceth the Glory of God; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that from the unbeleever God hath no more glory than if he had never ſent his Sonne into the world; No more glory than if there were no promiſe, no grace, no mercy and pardon: Let not then the People of God have low thoughts of Faith: No, thou doſt more in beleeving, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ingeſt more glory to God thereby, than thou couldeſt do by all thy other obedience. Shouldeſt thou mortifie ſinne to thy deſire? Shouldeſt thou dye a Martyr for the Cauſe of God? thou wouldeſt not ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God as thou doſt by beleeving. I know this ſeemeth very Paradoxall to the humbled ſinner: I know he is difficultly perſwaded, that by truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, he doth thus glorifie God; but if thou underſtandeſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-way, then thou wilt quickly ſee, as to beleeve is the moſt difficult duty, ſo it is the moſt conſequentiall for Gods glory: And indeed what have other Duties admirable in them, that Faith it ſelf in the Promiſe hath not? in beleeving the underſtanding is mortified, in beleeving the will is crucified, in beleeving the Heart and Affections are martyred: So that faith maketh a man to be offered up as an whole burnt-offering unto God.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Uſe</hi> of Inſtruction, <hi>That the onely way to make a man live a joyfull life in himſelf, and a glorifying life of God, is by faith in the Promiſes.</hi> This is that Faith by which a juſt man is ſaid to <hi>live;</hi> ſo that thy doubts, thy fears, thy unbeleeving thoughts, theſe bring a diſhonour to God, theſe reproach the Goſpel-way: theſe obſcure the honour of Chriſt. Let then the godly ſoul take heed how it giveth way unto ſuch temptations; if your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, if the glory of God be dear unto you, then bolt out unbeleef. No wonder if the devil that is ſo great an enemy to the glory of God, doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault your ſouls moſt in this; if he have broken down this part of the wall, what legions of other ſinnes may not he bring with them. For this reaſon many Divines ſay, <hi>Sola infidelit as damnat,</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if other ſinnes were not meritorious of damnation, yea, and did actually damn; only that oppoſeth the Phyſician, that would heal us, that refuſeth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement that is made for us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As the Promiſes are thus to be improved for Gods glory by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, ſo alſo attend to another effect, which the Scripture doth inferre from them, and that is <hi>to cleanſe our ſelves,</hi> to be every day <hi>perfecting holineſſe.</hi> For ſo the Apoſtle notably exhorts us, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 1.

Neither is faith in them a light ſuperficiall aſſent, ſwimming upon the heart as a fowl in the water, ſaid <hi>Luther:</hi> but as water calefied doth no more manifeſt its own coldneſſe, but the heat of the water, ſo doth faith fermentate and leaven the whole ſoul of a man, that humane things do not ſo much appear as divine things in him: As the Apoſtle expreſſeth the energy of it, when he ſaid, <hi>I no longer live, but Christ in me; and that life is by faith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. Thou then that ſayeſt, all thy truſt is in the Promiſes, thou hopeſt in them for mercy and pardon: Are they cleanſing Promiſes, purifying Promiſes?

Or we may make the coherence this, The Apoſtle in the verſe preceding ſpake of the certainty of Gods Promiſes in themſelves; they were in themſelves <hi>Yea and Amen;</hi> which is called, <hi>certitudo objecti,</hi> though ſome learned men think, that it is not a proper expreſſion. Now in this Verſe he cometh to the <hi>certitudo ſubjecti,</hi> or to ſhow whence it is that the children of God have this aſſured perſwaſion in their own hearts, that they are true and conſtant; whence it is that we are able to give our <hi>Amen,</hi> as a note of confirmation to them, and therefore in the words we may take notice of</p>

               </p>
               <p>Though the Promiſes be never ſo lovely and precious, though never ſo profitable and neceſſary for us, yet we are not able to reſt our ſelves upon them, but by the power of God ſtrengthening us. Our hearts do ſo quake and tremble with the conſideration of our own ſinnes, and unworthineſs, that unleſs the Lord make it ſtedfaſt and immoveable, we are toſſed up and down like the leaves of a tree. That it is God alone who doth thus preſerve and confirm us is plain, by that notable place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. where the Apoſtle prayeth, that <hi>God who had called them would make them perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, and ſettle them.</hi> The Apoſtle having before ſpoken of reſiſting the Devil, and of exſpecting afflictions, becauſe fleſh and blood would ſoon ſinck under theſe burdens, he directeth his prayer unto God for them, as knowing, if they had no better preſervers than themſelves, they were utterly undone. Now, although by that multiplication of words, the Apoſtle might ſeem to mean the ſame thing, yet every word hath its peculiar emphaſis: for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is uſed of <hi>nets,</hi> when they are to be <hi>mended,</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 19. and thereby is implyed, That the work of Grace, which we are as it were weaving every day, would quickly be all broken, did not the Grace of God conſtantly reſtore it. It is alſo uſed of <hi>members</hi> and <hi>parts of the body,</hi> when <hi>broken and ſet faſt again</hi> by the skill of the Chirurgion; and thus it ſuppoſeth how apt every believer is of himſelf to break all his grace into pieces, did not the power of God daily preſerve him. It ſheweth hereby, that there is no ſuch thing as perfection in this life. The other word is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which ſigrifieth <hi>firmly to ſtabliſh a thing,</hi> for it is more then <gap reason="foreign">

For this confirmation doth much relate to our perſeverance, that we ſhall never fall off from that ſtate of ſavour we are in, but that God who hath begun will alſo finiſh. Hence ſome contend that theſe words are to be read in the future tenſe, <hi>God will eſtabliſh,</hi> and not by way of prayer. To amplifie this Doctrine, many things are to be taken notice, of, as</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God may be ſaid to establiſh us two wayes, either in the thing it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. God may be ſaid to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh us either in the grace it ſelf, or in our apprehenſion of it.</note> 
                  <hi>ſelf, or elſe in our knowledge and apprehenſion.</hi> Theſe may be ſeparated from each other; God doth and will eſtabliſh his people, to their lives end, and till they come to the end of their race; the greateſt temptations and afflictions ſhall not break their intereſt in the favour of God: but then they may not have certain knowledg, they may be toſſed up and down with divers fears, that they are but hypocrites, that they ſhall never perſevere, that they ſhall not be able to hold out to the end. Therefore the people of God are to pray for and expect this twofold eſtabliſhing at Gods hand; both that God would preſerve the work of grace in their hearts, as alſo aſſure them
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:48709:316"/>
hereof, and confirm them in a powerfull perſwaſion of it; that is, it is in it ſelf ſure, ſo it may be to them, to which purpoſe that command is, <hi>make your calling and election ſure;</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is not in it ſelf, but to their own ſenſe and apprehenſion, and it is of this latter <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> the Text principally ſpeaketh, though it neceſſarily preſuppoſeth the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This effect which God is ſaid to work, implyeth what miſerable, weak, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. We are not able of our ſelves to do any thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the work of grace</note> 
                  <hi>impotent creatures we are, as to the work of grace, or any aſſurance by it.</hi> That as the world cannot enlighten it ſelf, if God withdraw the Sun, it is wholly in darkneſs: Thus is it with every man, though made godly. All this ſpiritual building would fall to the ground again; of ſpiritual thou wouldſt become carnal, did not God uphold thee: and then if thou hadſt obtained any aſſurance about thy condition, fears and doubts would preſently fill thy heart, if God doth not ſhine into thy ſoul. Thus as the earth without the Heavens would be as it was at firſt, a confuſed Chaos, ſo is the heart of man without the dayly Influence of Gods grace upon it. But this will come in more pertinently upon the next particular, in the Diviſion of this Text.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are therefore to conſider <hi>wherein lieth this eſtabliſhing work of Gods</hi>

               <p>Confirmation being properly upon the will, and the affections. Before this can be done, <hi>It is neceſſary that the underſtanding of a man, which is a guide to all the other powers of the ſoul, that it be prepared and formed by God there unto.</hi> The work of God therefore is, to illuminate and inlighten the minde, that ſo thereby the heart of a man may be more ſettled upon the Promiſes. And for <note place="margin">How God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. 1. By diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own infirmity.</note> Illumination that doth manifeſt it ſelf in theſe Particulars;</p>
               <p n="1">1. God doth <hi>diſcover unto us our own infirmity and impotency;</hi> that we are not able in the leaſt meaſure to confirm our ſelves. We experimentally finde, how often purpoſes and reſolutions were upon us to thoſe things that were good, how often like <hi>Sampſon</hi> we did ſuffer our ſelves to be bound by many obligations, and decrees of ſpirit, but (alas) upon every emergent temptation we did immediately break all again. That which <hi>Auſtin</hi> did ſo bitterly complain of in himſelf, <hi>viz. the uncertainty and inconſtancy of his deſires.</hi> The ſame may every one finde, while left to his own ſtrength. It is therefore a ſpecial preparatory work of God, for our ſettlement, to make us ſee our own ſelf-emptineſs. When <hi>Peter</hi> had confidence of his own ſpiritual ability, in what a ſad revolt did it end? he that had more than ordinary confidence, fell into more than ordinary fear. So that, it is a great work of God, when he fully informeth us, that we are nothing, and can do nothing. Though we have ten thouſand Promiſes ſet before our eyes, yet we are not able to reach forth the hand, to lay hold upon any of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Object about which we are enlightened preparatorily to our <note place="margin">2. The accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe of the work of ſaith.</note> ſettlement, is the <hi>acceptableneſs of the work of Faith:</hi> That it is his will we ſhould depend wholly upon him; that whatſoever burden we feel upon us by our ſinnes, yet it is the way he taketh delight in, that we ſhould wait on him, truſt in him, roll our ſtaggering ſoules as it were upon him: and this is no mean work of God, thus to inform and direct a man. For what is it that maketh the afflicted ſinner for his ſinnes be toſſed up and down with ſuch fears and doubts? is it not becauſe he ſeeeth nor that it is his duty to caſt himſelf into the armes of Chriſt: he doth not conſider how ſeverely it's commanded, inſomuch that that very ſin of not believing, of not reſting our ſoules upon the Lord Chriſt would damn us, if there were nothing elſe. How happy then is it! and in what good forwardneſs are they for eſtabliſhment, who begin thus to be inlightened? who are thus perſwaded? Though I cannot believe, yet it is my duty to believe. Its not Gods will that I ſhould excruciate my ſelf with theſe tormenting doubts.
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:48709:317"/>
I am ſure to be damned if I go not to Chriſt the Saviour, if I take not this way, there is no way for me to take; and thus we have got advantage, when we are come thus far. And that this may be done, all thoſe Texts which do either command faith, or commend faith, are very often in his minde.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The minde of a man is antecedently wrought upon for eſtabliſhment by illumination, <hi>concerning the Evangelical way of grace wherein God doth vouchſafe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. The evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall way of Gods vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing mercy to the ſoul.</note> 
                  <hi>all ſpiritual mercies to the broken in heart.</hi> For the ſpirit of God doth not inable us to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father, till our underſtandings are opened to know that glorious Goſpel-way Chriſt hath taken for to ſave the humbled ſinners; the ſum whereof is this, That it is in <hi>believing,</hi> not in working, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle argueth againſt all conceits of Juſtification by the works we do; yea, that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, though ſo eminent in holineſs, did not obtain remiſſion of ſinnes hereby, and in other places the <hi>righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> and the <hi>righteouſneſs of works</hi> are made immediately oppoſite to one another. It is then a ſpecial mercy of God to have the judgment of a man ſatisfied in this truth, although the poor humbled ſinner cannot yet repoſe himſelf in the boſome of a Promiſe, though he doth nothing but ſtagger and reel up and down by fears and temptations; yet this is no ſmall proficiency to arrive at the certain perſwaſion of this Doctrine. For we ſee in the Apoſtles dayes that this very Doctrine was called into queſtion, and is it not ſtill by Papiſts and others arraigned, as teaching men Preſumption and Security? and truly, as the head of a man may invent many plauſible Arguments againſt the truth of it; ſo the heart of a man is naturally proud, and ſelf-righteous, and therefore is hardly brought off from works to faith; for faith ſeemeth not to have that activity for juſtification as love and other graces have, though indeed that be the life and ſoul of all, the <hi>primum vivens,</hi> and <hi>ultimum moriens.</hi> As it is with the roots of trees, they have no ſweetneſs nor comelineſs in them, when the fruit thereof hath: Thus when good works are glorious and precious, faith from whence they have their life and being ſeemeth contemptible. But this order the ſpirit of God taketh, before it is a ſealing and a witneſſing ſpirit unto us. It is alſo an enligtening and teaching ſpirit, and that eſpecially in this grand truth, which is the ſum of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>by faith, and not by works, we become juſtified before God:</hi> and where his Goſpel-light hath not taken place in any afflicted conſcience for ſin, Oh the unſpeakable temptations, oh the wofull dayes and nights that they meet with. When the ſpirit of God hath thus antecedently wrought upon the judgment, then in the next place cometh this chief and ſpecial work of eſtabliſhing and ſetling the <hi>heart.</hi> And as it is in planting of a tree, firſt the briars and thornes which cumbred the ground before, muſt be removed, and then the tree is planted. Thus alſo it is with God, while ſetling the heart of a man upon the Promiſes; he doth firſt remove that which is prohibent, and hindring of this confirmation, and poſitively inables it to reſt upon Chriſt; even as the ſun doth firſt diſpel the darkneſs, and then introduce the light.</p>
               <p>The two Impediments to our eſtabliſhment on the Promiſes alone are <note place="margin">2. In ſetling the and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments.</note> 
                  <hi>Preſumption</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Deſpair</hi> on the other; for thoſe are the two Generals as it were, under which all the other ſinnes oppoſite to this way, are comprehended;</p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and that is the damnable eſtate of moſt men, they <note place="margin">1. Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> are ſecure in their own condition, they reſt contented in their own righteouſneſs and goodneſs. Now theſe indeed are ſettled but upon a rotten foundation, theſe have no changes, no inconſtancies of ſpirit ariſing from the fear that is in them, but are therefore the more dangerous. Such as theſe are the moſt untractable and unteachable, both about the promiſes of God, and their dependance on them; you can no more remove them out of their Preſumption than mountains out of their places, the ſaddeſt ſubject in the world to preach
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:48709:317"/>
upon, or to preach unto; for they have door upon door, and bolt upon bolt, that muſt be opened, ere you can make any way for Chriſt or the Promiſes in their ſoules. All the weapons taken out of Gods word are peeſently dulled, when they fall upon them, like a bullet in a pack of wool. When we come to ſuch upon their ſick beds, we know not how to begin with them, what to ſay to them; for whatſoever is ſaid, they are confident it is in them; and all this while its nothing but Preſumption, and ſpiritual ſecurity of ſoul.</p>
               <p>The other is <hi>Deſpair,</hi> with all diffidence and diſtruſtfull fears that incline <note place="margin">2. Deſpair.</note> thereunto. This (I confeſs) is not ſo common as the other. We have very few that cry out of their ſinnes, fearing they are greater then can be forgiven. But ſome there are that are ready to be ſwallowed up in this whirlpool. When therefore God doth confirm the heart of man in the Promiſes, both theſe ſinnes are removed, he is no longer a ſelf-righteous man, a ſelf-full man, he looketh upon himſelf as wicked, and deſtitute of all, and yet on the other ſide doth not deſpair in God, though he doth in himfelf; though he hath nothing of his own to ſtand upon, yet Chriſt is his rock on whom he is ſetled. Thus God keepeth his people from being <hi>Cains,</hi> and <hi>Judaſſes</hi> on one ſide, and proud, ſelf-righteous Phariſees on the other ſide.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby God doth ſtrengthen the heart in reference to the Promiſes, by working in us habits of grace, and ſome permanent conſtant Principles, whereby we are carried out eaſily and delightſomly unto them.</hi> The heart of man being originally and habitually corrupt, is contrary both to the commands of God, and the Promiſes of God, which is greatly to be obſerved; for the enmity indeed of our hearts againſt thoſe holy duties which the Law commandeth is often treated on, that is conſtantly preached upon; but the ſinfull enmity that is in our hearts naturally to cloſe with the Promiſes of God, that is ſeldome thought upon. It is therefore very neceſſary to know the backwardneſs and frowardneſs of the heart, to embrace Promiſes, as well as to obey commands: For, whence is it that the heart is humbled for ſin? whence is it ſenſible of the guilt and burthen thereof, that it flyeth from the Promiſe? whence is it that
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:48709:318"/>
the Goſpel of Grace, and Juſtification of a ſinner is ſuch a Myſtery to it? Whence is it that experience in a godly man teacheth him that Faith in the Promiſes of all works is the moſt difficult? Is not all this from the contrariety of the heart, though humbled, to Gods way of Promiſes? This being then laid for a foundation, when God doth ſanctifie a man, he doth not only put theſe Principles into him, wherby he is inabled to obey the commands of God, but alſo whereby he is ſtrengthened to receive the Promiſes of God. And therefore as we have the Spirit of Sanctification, whereby we are fitted for Holineſs, ſo we need the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we are prepared for the Promiſes of God. Now if you ask what are thoſe habitual Principles wrought in us by God, whereby we entertain the Promiſes, and apply them to our own ſelves? I anſwer, They are theſe,</p>
               <p>The Firſt, <hi>which doth immediately and formally work the ſoul thereunto is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith.</hi> Faith and the Promiſes are mutually related one to another, They are like the ſtomach and meat, hence <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. it is ſaid, <hi>That the Promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> And <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. the Gentiles are ſaid to <hi>receive the promiſe of the Spirit through faith.</hi> By which it doth appear that the Promiſe without faith doth us no more good than meat without eating: Therefore to <hi>believe</hi> is John 6. <hi>to eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his blood.</hi> This Faith therefore in the Scripture is commended above all other Graces, both in reſpect of its working, <hi>ad intra,</hi> and <hi>ad extra: ad intra,</hi> for by it Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts, by it we receive the Promiſes, by it we are juſtified, by it the heart is purified: and then <hi>ad extra,</hi> by faith we are quickened up to all thoſe holy duties which are required of us. It is faith which <hi>worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. and ſo by patience, by zeal, by repentance. If then thou wouldſt have thy ſoul fixed upon the Promiſes, pray above all things for this grace of <hi>faith. Faith</hi> diſpelleth fears, doubtings, and all temptations of Satan: therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>kept by the power of God, but through faith to ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. we are left, as in a ſafe garriſon, ſo the word ſignifieth, as ſome obſerve. Know then, that if thy faith could alwayes be kept lively, and vigorous in thee, there is nothing could divide between thee and the promiſe; but as the childe in the wombe is nouriſhed by the navel of the mother, ſo is thy heart by <hi>Faith</hi> in the Promiſes. Hence it is obſerved, that of the ſame root in the Hebrew, whence the word Faith cometh, there ariſeth alſo the word ſignifying a <hi>nurſe,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Numb. 11. 12. as a nurſing father beareth the ſucking childe:</hi> as if <hi>faith</hi> did make a man continually ſuck at the Promiſes, as a childe doth at the nurſes breaſts. This then is the moſt eminent and principal grace, eſtabliſhing the heart: As on the contrary, <hi>unbelief</hi> is that which doth unſettle and diſtract the heart.</p>
               <p>A Second habitual grace and principle inclining the heart to the Promiſes, is <note place="margin">2. Love.</note> 
                  <hi>Love:</hi> not that we are juſtified by love, or that love is a receptive grace, applying the Promiſes; but only it doth ſweeten the heart in reference to God. It putteth us upon good thoughts to God, we look not upon him as a ſevere judg, taking all opportunities to damn us, but as a gracious and loving father, reconciled to us through the blood of Chriſt. Therefore not only faith, but love likewiſe doth expell tormenting fears, and doubts. Thus the Apoſtle notably 1 <hi>John 4, 18. There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſteth out fear, becauſe fear hath torment. He that feareth</hi> viz. in this ſlaviſh manner <hi>is not made perfect in love.</hi> We ſee in this Text what the nature of <hi>ſlaviſh fear</hi> is, and what is the proper effect of a <hi>filial</hi> love of God. <hi>Slaviſh fear is tormenting:</hi> doth not every ſoul exerciſed therewith, ſubſcribe thereunto? are not ſervile fears almoſt like the torments of Hell it ſelf? How intolerable is it to fear God as <hi>Cain</hi> did, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, with dreadfull apprehenſions of Gods wrath againſt them? Thus fear produceth ſpiritual hornets as it were in the ſoul to ſting it
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:48709:318"/>
day and night; but <hi>love,</hi> the more that is perfected, it caſteth out them. How bleſſed a thing then is it to have the <hi>heart filled with the love of God?</hi> For as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. Love ſuffereth long, and is kind, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil.</hi> Thus doth our love affect us towards God: though he exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and chaſtizeth us, yet we ſuffer long, and bear it patiently; neither do we entertain hard thoughts of God, as if he were too ſevere, as if he did puniſh us more than our ſins deſerve: it removeth theſe ſuſpicious thoughts which guilt is apt to raiſe up in us, as if God were become our enemy, and interpreting every thing in the worſt ſenſe; yea this <hi>love ſeeketh not her own,</hi> but ſo that God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, that his great name is magnified and glorified, he mattereth not his own conſent and eaſe. Therefore though God leave him long in deſertions, though he be under manifold temptations, yet he ſaith, <hi>God is good,</hi> and he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God, even when God ſeemeth not to love him; ſo we may truly ſay with <hi>Solomon,</hi> Cant. 8. 6. <hi>Love is as ſtrong as death, the coales thereof are as coales of fire. Many waters cannot quench love, many floods cannot drown it.</hi> Certainly if this be true of humane love, how much more of divine love? If therefore thou wouldſt have thy heart ſetled upon the promiſes, preſerve this love like the fire upon the altar of thy heart daily.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another habitual principle to confirm the heart upon the promiſes, <note place="margin">3. Heavenly courage and ſpiritual forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> is, <hi>Spiritual fortitude and heavenly courage. Ariſtotle</hi> maketh <hi>fortitude</hi> a moral vertue, when a man either doth or ſuffereth great things for vertues ſake; but <hi>Chriſtian fortitude</hi> is of a more ſublime nature: neither do we ſpeak of it, as enduring great things from man, but from God. For we may ſee <hi>David</hi> many times ready to ſink under the heavy temptations, he was conflicting with; but then ſee how his holy generoſity recovereth it ſelf, <hi>Pſal. 42. 9, 11. I will ſay unto God my rock, why haſt thou forgotten me?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul! Why art thou diſquieted? hope in God.</hi> Hence <hi>David</hi> exhorteth all that hope in God, <hi>Pſal. 31. 24. To be of good courage, and God ſhall ſtrengthen their hearts.</hi> Of all temptations none are ſo grievous to be born, as thoſe which ariſe from Gods withdrawing of himſelf, and hiding of his face from us; then we apprehend no promiſes do belong unto us; then we queſtion very principles, and ſo are like a ſhip toſſed in the Sea, without Pilot or Anchor. Therefore <hi>ſpiritual fortitude</hi> to withſtand theſe ſtrong aſſaults, is above all required. How many have ſunk irrecoverably into this pit of deſtruction? So that unleſſe Gods power ſettle us, unleſſe that compoſe our hearts, we can as well remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as this ſad and ſainting ſpirit of ours. Lay then faſt hold on Chriſt, thou canſt not ſink in theſe waters, if his arm doth uphold thee. Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> is exhorted, <hi>To be ſtrong in the grace that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 1. there is his duty to be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> but how muſt he come to have this ſtrength, <hi>It is by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> you would think the exhortation were ſuperfluous: for why muſt I be ſtrong, if it be the grace of Chriſt that muſt enable me? But the exhortation is uſefull howſoever; for hereby we are taught our duty, as alſo to go out of our ſelves, renouncing our own ſtrength, and laying the faſter hold upon Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. To this purpoſe we have the like exhortation, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 10. Finally my brethren be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might:</hi> when he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid down ſeveral precepts, then knowing how impotent and unable we are, he ſaith, <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord.</hi> Here you ſee what we are commanded, but it is the <hi>power of his might,</hi> that is, <hi>his mighty power,</hi> that muſt confirm us; and where this is preſent, then we wonder how we are carried through ſuch tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, led through ſuch wilderneſſes as we have been; we ſtand and admire to ſee what red Seas we have gone thorow, and how the waters have yeelded unto us. Thus <hi>Paul, I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me, Phil.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Divine hope doth exceedingly conduce to ſtabliſh the ſoul upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Divine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>
                  <pb n="612" facs="tcp:48709:319"/>
as you heard, from thoſe admonitions of <hi>David</hi> to his ſoul, <hi>Hope thou ſtill in God.</hi> Faith is carried out to the truth of God, and hope to the mercy and power of God; and therefore he that hopeth in God, is got into the Ark, while others float in the waters, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. it is compared to the <hi>Anchor of the ſoul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entereth within the vail.</hi> By this we ſee, that <hi>hope</hi> doth notably ſettle the ſoul. Faith indeed and hope are two ſiſters and twins, and look ſo like one another, that we can hardly make the difference; yet <hi>faith</hi> eſtabliſheth the ſoul upon the promiſes, by apprehending them as preſent; ſo that the ſoul is in as holy a manner ſecure, as if it were already in Heaven. But <hi>hope</hi> doth ſettle the ſoul on Gods promiſes, as the things promiſed are future and to come. For ſeeing between Gods promiſes, and the accompliſhment of them, there happen ſo many croſſe providences in appearance; yea ſo many difficulties and ſeeming impoſſibilities are in the way, we need ſome divine grace to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all theſe, and that is <hi>hope,</hi> compared excellently to an <hi>Anchor;</hi> for as that doth faſten the ſhip, which otherwiſe would be toſſed up and down, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſplitting upon every Rock; ſo the ſoul of the moſt godly man is toſſed up and down with ſuch ſad temptations, that did not this hope bear up the heart, all would fail within us. But this ſpiritual anchor exceedeth all material ones; for <hi>this is ſure and ſtedfaſt. Sure,</hi> ſo that no outward violence of ſtorms can break it: and <hi>ſtedfaſt,</hi> in reſpect from within there is nothing without or within that can diſanu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l this. But then whereas other anchors are faſtened into the earth, this is in Heaven, in God, and inviſible things. A godly mans hope cannot be ſeen by the bodily eye. Take heed then of weakning this grace of <hi>hope,</hi> it's an excellent corroborater of the ſoul, ſtaying it up with that glory, which will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed hereafter.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Another habitual principle, whereby God doth exceedingly eſtabliſh the heart on the promiſes, is <hi>Spiritual joy and heavenly conſolations.</hi> This is <note place="margin">5. Spiritual joy</note> one great reaſon, ſay Divines, why Angels and Saints in Heaven are ſo confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that eſtate, that nothing can tempt them off from God, they never will be weary of the preſence of God; even becauſe they are filled with ſo much infinite delight and joy, that they cannot deſire any better thing than God. Now the godly they have the beginnings of theſe conſolations here upon earth; for by the <hi>ſpirit of adoption,</hi> they are ſo filled with joy and delight, that all the world is no more than an husk unto them; they look upon the world as a wilderneſſe, and Heaven as the <hi>Canaan.</hi> So that ſpiritual conſolations, when wrought in the ſoul, are like a mighty pillar to bear up the heart. Hence the Apoſtle prayeth, 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 17. That God would comfort their hearts, and ſtabliſh them.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Comfort,</hi> and then <hi>eſtabliſh.</hi> How hardly is the heart dejected, and full of deſpondent thoughts <hi>eſtabliſhed?</hi> But <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> is oil to the wheels. Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſpake, <hi>Neh. 8. 10. Be not ye ſorry, for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> So much ſinfull grief as thou letteſt in, it is like the letting in of waters at ſome leak in the ſhip, it may ſink the ſhip at laſt. Bleſſe God therefore for any gladneſſe of heart, for any conſolations of ſoul through the Spirit of God; theſe ſupport the ſoul, theſe make it rejoyce in the midſt of all afflictions. It is true, ſometimes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, for wiſe and holy ends are deprived of them; but when they are vouchſafed, they come like pleaſant gales of winde to carry the ſhip to its Haven.</p>
               <p>In the next place, As God doth poſitively eſtabliſh by theſe habitual princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; <note place="margin">2. By actual motions of his Spirit upon us</note> ſo alſo by the <hi>actual motions of his Spirit upon us.</hi> There is not only habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace, but efficacious grace, whereby the Lord worketh in us both to <hi>will and to do.</hi> How many times do the principles of grace, like Chriſt in the ſhip, lie aſleep in us, inſomuch that till they be awakened, we are in danger of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack? Therefore when the Apoſtle exhorteth us, <hi>To work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. he giveth a wonderfull reaſon; <hi>for it's God that
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:48709:319"/>
worketh in you to will and to do, and that of his good pleaſure.</hi> So that the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of God lieth chiefly in this, in actuating thoſe habitual principles within us, whereby we depend upon God continually, as the beams of the Sun do upon the Sun. This Doctrine <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> cannot reliſh: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if God come not with efficacious actual help, as well as habitual; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the fals of Gods people in all ages, will palpably declare they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Having thus illuſtrated the Doctrine, let us touch ſome <hi>arguments à posteriori;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Arguments that all our eſtabliſhment is from God. It appears, 1. From that unevenneſs that is in the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> whereby it is plain, <hi>That all our eſtabliſhment is from God.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is plain, <hi>In that a godly man findeth ſuch an inequality in the temper of his ſoul.</hi> Sometimes he is able to withſtand ſtrong guſts of temptations; and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, he is ſo weak, that every blow will beat him down. <hi>David</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth theſe hils and valleys in his ſoul in many <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Now if it were a mans own ſtrength, then he would be more conſtant and uniform. Only by theſe eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and flowings we are taught, that God doth alone ſupport us; if he withdraw his hand, then are we troubled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is plain, <hi>Becauſe ſometimes weak Chriſtians have gone through great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. In that weak Chriſtians have gone through great temptations, when ſtrong ones have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> 
                  <hi>when ſtrong ones have exceedingly failed.</hi> Did not <hi>Peter</hi> an eminent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Chriſt fall very dangerouſly? And yet how many weak women have been inabled to become Martyrs for Chriſt? Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> called the <hi>father of the faithfull,</hi> ſhew much ſinfull fear when he was in <hi>Abimelechs</hi> country? Alas, if <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> hair be cut, he is no ſtronger than other men. Oh the wiſe diſpenſation of God! Sometimes the ſtrong Chriſtian ſtumbleth and falleth, when the weak ſtandeth. And why is all this? but as the Apoſtle teacheth us, to ſhew, <hi>That the root beareth us, and not we the root,</hi> Rom. 11. 18. Chriſt keepeth us to him, we do not keep Chriſt to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That it is God alone who eſtabliſheth, as appeareth, <hi>By the prayers of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It appears from the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Gods people.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods people.</hi> And it's a Rule of <hi>Auſtins</hi> of old againſt the <hi>Pelagians, It is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing to pray unto God for that which is in our own power.</hi> If we can eſtabliſh our ſelves, why do we pray, that <hi>God would not lead us into temptation?</hi> Do we not therein proclaim, that our own power, our own ſtrength cannot preſerve us in any temptation? Thus <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Uphold me according to thy Word,</hi> Pſa. 119. 116. and <hi>Pſal. 51. 12. Uphold me with thy free ſpirit.</hi> The guilt upon his ſoul, for thoſe groſſe ſins would have ſwept him away like a flood, had not God mercifully upheld him: and as the godly have declared this by prayer, ſo alſo by their praiſes and thankſgiving, acknowledging that they could never have gone through ſuch exerciſes, conflicted with ſuch temptations, had not the Lord ſupported them. They wonder to ſee how their hearts were kept up under ſuch dejections. Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63. 8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee, thy right hand upholdeth me.</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 145. 14. The Lord upholdeth thoſe that fall;</hi> though they fall, yet he doth not quite take off his hand from them, but raiſeth them up again. Thus you ſee how true the Text is, <hi>That it is God who eſtabliſheth us.</hi>

               <p>THe next thing conſiderable is the <hi>Subject</hi> of this <hi>Eſtabliſhment,</hi> with the <hi>Object</hi> wherein. The <hi>Subject</hi> is, <hi>Us with you.</hi> In this doth appear the Apoſtles modeſty and humility; Though he had ſuch a plerophory, and did exceed many others, as much as the Cypreſſe doth the ſhrubs, yet he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth it not to his own ſtrength, or power, but to the grace of God: If God leave him, then this <hi>Samſon</hi> is no more than other men. And when he ſaith, <hi>With you]</hi> this is to be underſtood indefinitely, not univerſally. For who can think, that every <hi>Corinthian</hi> was thus eſtabliſhed, anointed and ſealed? But it is ordinary with the Apoſtle, when writing to Churches, to ſpeak of them as thoſe that are truly godly, either becauſe many were ſo, or elſe becauſe in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it was meet for him to think ſo. Or laſtly, becauſe according to their outward calling and profeſſion they declared themſelves obliged and bound thereunto. Thus writing to the Church of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he ſpeaketh general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Grieue not the Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 30.</p>
               <p>In the next place, you have the <hi>Object,</hi> and that is, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in Chriſtum.</hi> Some render it, as being more emphatical. The ſenſe is, that we are incorporated (as it were) into Chriſt, and thereby eſtabliſhed, for out of Chriſt, we are as reeds ſhaken with every wind. From theſe two particulars, we may obſerve two Doctrines to be briefly diſpatched at this time. The firſt is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That even the moſt eminent in godlineſſe do need Gods power to ſtabliſh them,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſtrongeſt Chriſtians need Gods eſtabliſhing grace as well as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>as the weakeſt and moſt infirm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even the <hi>Pauls</hi> that are like gyants, when others are but as dwarfs, are not preſerved by their own power. It's Gods right hand that upholdeth them, and if that be removed, they are no more than other men. This is a very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth to be improved for the comfort of thoſe that are weak in their own ſenſe and feeling. Whatſoever encouragements you declare to them, they are ready to put off all with this; It is true, ſuch as <hi>Paul,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> that were ſtarres of the firſt magnitude, theſe could do ſo; God was in a ſpecial manner preſent with them. But we muſt not argue from theſe Cedars to ſuch Briars as we are; whereas this Text ſheweth, that all are alike as to this
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:48709:320"/>
dependance alone upon God, <hi>Us with you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and therefore we have him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and in other places putting himſelf in the number of other Chriſtians, and a guing for their juſtification, perſeverance and eternal glory, by ſuch arguments as are common to all believers, not from any thing peculiar and extraordinary in himſelf. So that all believers have the ſame God, the ſame Chriſt to reſt their ſouls upon, though they differ much in their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent graces. Thus we may ſee <hi>David</hi> a preſident herein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 6. when he had declared Gods great goodneſſe to him, upon his purpoſe to confeſs his ſins, <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, thou forgaveſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ſinne:</hi> that is ſpoken by way of aggravation; whatſoever was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and damnable in it, though never in ſo heinous a manner, thou didſt pardon it; then mark the inference, <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly, pray unto thee for this,</hi> becauſe God did ſo with <hi>David:</hi> whereas it might be objected, Though God did ſo with <hi>David.</hi> yet will he with ſuch an unworthy wretch as I am? But <hi>David</hi> anſwereth you, <hi>For this euery godly man ſhall be encouraged to pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To demonſtrate the Doctrine, <hi>viz. That the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians are alone ſtabliſhed by the power of God,</hi> conſider theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The examples of the fals of the moſt godly men that are recorded in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. It appears from the falls the ſtrongeſt have had.</note> 
                  <hi>Scripture.</hi> By which it is plain, that not they themſelves, but the power of God did preſerve them, and when that had forſaken them, being left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they fall into the mire. Thus <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> are ſad inſtances: what weakneſſe is upon the beſt, if the Lord forſake them but for a while? <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo confident of his immoyeableneſſe, that he thought, though all others ſhould deny Chriſt, yet he would ſtand it out; but how ſadly did he fall to the great bit erneſſe of his ſoul? Thus the godly appear ſometimes like Trees in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which though having ſome life in the root, yet outwardly have no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent difference from thoſe that are ſtark dead; and all is, becauſe they have not that eſtabliſhing grace they uſe to have. Let not then the ſtrong man in grace, glory in his ſtrength, nor the ſwift man in the wayes of Heaven, glory in his ſwiftneſſe and fervency, for he is alone ſupported by the power of God. Yea, which is the more obſervable, you may ſee them falling and ſtaggering in thoſe particular graces, wherein they ſeem to be moſt corroborated. <hi>Abraham</hi> is the <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi> and yet he diſcovered much <hi>carnal fear</hi> in <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi>'s countrey. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>meekeſt man upon the earth,</hi> yet in what a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward paſſion, when he ſtruck the Rock? which ſo provoked God, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had onely a ſight of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and was not permitted to enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. <hi>Peter</hi> is noted to have the greateſt <hi>fervency and zeale</hi> of all the Apoſtles, and yet how ſurprized with <hi>cowardize</hi> and <hi>ſinnefull feare?</hi> In theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all other, you would not have thought they ſhould ſtumble and and fall: But behold how it is the arme of the Lord that doth beare us up.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This truth is demonſtrated from thoſe wonderfull dispenſations</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 From Gods diſpenſations towards them</note> 
                  <hi>towards his beſt ſervants.</hi> Many are the temptations that they are aſſaulted with; and all this is, to ſhew their impotency to them, to diſcover their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to them, that ſo they may be humble alwayes in their own eyes. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> they were in conſtant exerciſes; no ſooner were they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Lion, but a Bear met them; one wave followed another. And what was the end of all this, but to keep them in continual dependance and waiting upon God? <hi>David</hi> alſo was conſtantly in a wilderneſſe, where no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was; and Gods end herein was to make him ſee his ſalvation was in God alone. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, though by the grace of God he was ſo preſerved, that after his converſion we read of no other extraordinary fall he had, yet leſt hereby, as alſo from many other glorious priviledges he enjoyed, he ſhould be
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:48709:321"/>
                  <hi>puffed up above meaſure,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. <hi>he had the buffetings of Satan, and a thorn in the fleſh,</hi> to make him go out of himſelf, and to reſt on Chriſt only. So that Gods end in putting them upon theſe trials, is to inſtruct them wherein, or in whom their ſtrength doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That it is God alone who doth ſtabliſh the moſt holy,</hi> will appear, <note place="margin">3. From the Devils malice againſt them more than others.</note> 
                  <hi>If you conſider how great the power, ſubtilty and malice of the Devil is, who is ſet againſt them more than any others.</hi> As <hi>Chriſt</hi> told his Apoſtles, <hi>Satan had a deſire to ſift them as wheat,</hi> Luk. 22. 31. Thus the Devil doth with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt violence oppoſe thoſe, that are more eſteemed for gifts and graces than others. Theſe like <hi>Uriah</hi> ſtand in the fore-front of the battle; for if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, if they become a ſtumbling block; and a reproach, God is more diſhonoured, wicked men are more hardened, then if many weak Chriſtians ſhould fall: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that are remarkably godly, they are to be ſo farre from high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe and ſelf-confidence, that indeed they are to be in the greateſt fear and watchfulneſſe; for it is ſuch as thou art, the Devil aimeth at. The trees full of fruit have the greateſt violence made upon their boughs. Now alas, what is a godly mans ſtrength to the Devils violent aſſaults and ſubtil inſinuations, if God did not ſtrengthen him. What defence hath a ſheep againſt a roaring Lion? Obſerve that reaſon expreſſed, 1 <hi>John 4. 4. You have overcome Antichriſt,</hi> ſaith that Apoſtle; but why? <hi>Becauſe greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the world. In you]</hi> that is emphatical: It's Chriſt dwelling <hi>in us,</hi> that keepeth off Satans victorious power, and all his inſtruments. Thus alſo 1 <hi>John 5. 5. It is faith that overcometh the world,</hi> which alwayes relieth on a power without us; for <hi>faith</hi> as it is a grace, doth not; but as it receiveth ſtrength from Chriſt: As the Vine and Ivy are not ſupported of themſelves, but by thoſe trees they lean unto.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is plain, that God alone doth eſtabliſh the moſt able believers from</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. From Gods leaving them oft to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may ſee their ſtrength to be only in him.</note> 
                  <hi>that providence of God, whereby he many times leaveth ſuch to themſelves, that in their own experience and acknowledgement of others they may ſee all help is from God alone.</hi> This truth the godly are not alwayes ſo practically convinced of, as they ſhould be. Hence they are apt to be puffed up ſometimes with ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and complacency in themſelves, for which God doth leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they thereby falling, may know what they are of themſelves, and what they are by the grace of God. Thus it is noted of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a man full of integrity in Gods wayes, 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 31. God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</hi> Even this good man did not know how baſe, falſe and deceitfull his heart was, and therefore <hi>God left him:</hi> and we ſee the bleſſed effect of this mercifull deſertion, <hi>verſ. 26. Hezekiah humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart.</hi> Is not here then a plain inſtance, that God many times in much mercy leaveth the godly to themſelves, that ſo they may have full ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this truth upon their hearts? This alſo was the caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> who did not anſwer his name of a <hi>Rock</hi> in this caſe; and had the Church been built on him, as the Papiſts boaſt, it had fallen all into pieces; for it was Chriſts looking upon him that recovered him, not any ſtrength of his own. But how cometh <hi>Peter</hi> thus to ſtumble and fall? It was becauſe of his ſelf-confidence and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in his own power; yea ſome have ſaid that Chriſt left him meerly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not for any preceding ſinne in <hi>Peter,</hi> but only by way of meer diſpenſation, that hereby an example of humility and holy fear might be left upon record to all ages. But that <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſinne of groſs confidence did deſerve this graduall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction, is more than probable: only we grant that as God doth ſometimes tempt, ſo alſo forſake ſometimes for ſinnes antecedent, ſometimes from his meer ſoveraignty and holy wiſdome, thereby to teach man, that which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would not be acknowledged. It is indeed a Rule, that <hi>Deus neminem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrit, niſi prius deſeratur: God forſaketh none, that doth not forſake him;</hi> which
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:48709:321"/>
may be granted as true, if we ſpeak of a deſertion by way of anger and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but of a deſertion by way of mercy and triall, or thereby to make way for greater diſpenſations of his glory, ſo it is not alwayes true; God may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake gradually, that thereby he may not forſake totally and finally. Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions that are for a ſeaſon are ſometimes mercies and very uſefull, being a ſubſtraction of grace, in order to fill us with more grace: And the end of ſuch providential adminiſtrations is to convince us fully of this truth, that we do not ſettle our ſelves, but it is God that doth it for us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>This truth may be demonſtrated from the nature of that grace which is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. From the nature of the grace within us.</note> 
                  <hi>habitual and permanent in us.</hi> For though that there be in us as a principle qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying of us to work holy things with delight, joy and content, yet it cannot put us upon working without a further actual efficacious work of grace upon our ſouls; which you heard the Apoſtle calleth, <hi>Working in us both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. So that although there be never ſo much grace planted in us, yet that lieth aſleep (as it were) and worketh not, till this efficacious grace actuate it, and put it into motion; neither ought this to be any wonder to us. For we ſee in natural cauſes, it is not enough to have a principle of life, unleſs God alſo enable us to move; <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> much more then muſt this be in ſupernatural things, where the <hi>Actus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>ſecundus</hi> is of God. Not but that in the progreſſe of grace we act and move, but <hi>Acti agimus, moti movemus.</hi> It is the grace of God that doth effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly incline the ſanctified will to ſpiritual operation; then the North-wind, and the South, doe (as it were) blow upon the ſpiccs, that they may ſend forth their fragrant ſmell. It is true, at the firſt work of grace, there we are meerly paſſive, but God doth not then force our will, he only changeth it; as water which naturally deſcends, when made air doth naturally aſcend upwards. Thus the will of a man which was depreſſed to earthly things by ſinne, when ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and made heavenly aſcendeth up towards God and heavenly objects. By theſe diſcoveries it is manifeſt, that the beſt Saint in this world is ſetled by the grace of God alone. Thoſe corruptions within him are treacherous, and would betray him into the hands of Satan, did not Chriſt corroborate him. And is this any wonder of man fallen, ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> fell for want of this confirming grace, and the elect Angels do therefore not leave their habitation, as the Apoſtate have, becauſe the grace of God doth confirm them? So that the good uſe we are to make of this Doctrine, is to be exceeding watchfull and tender about all ſinne, leſt thereby we provoke God to leave us. How terrible do ſuch deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many times prove? To whom are woes, to whom are wounds and gripes of conſcience, but many times to thoſe, who being left of God, have thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſinfull wayes, and ſo having loſt an holy frame of heart, have thereby deprived themſelves likewiſe of an Evangelical, comfortable one? Take heed through thy lazineſſe, negligence, pride, or ſome other ſinne, God forſake thee, and thou become worſe than <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> of a godly man, made like a beaſt. This will be bitterneſſe in the latter end.</p>
               <p>As for the ſecond Doctrine, I ſhall not ſay much to that, becauſe it hath been in part already ſpoken unto; it is</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in Chriſt alone we are eſtabliſhed.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In Chriſt alone we are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That as in the building, other ſtones are ſtrengthened, becauſe of the corner ſtone, or the foundation ſtone; or as the branch in the Vine doth therefore live and flouriſh, becauſe in the Vine: ſo it is with us, becauſe in Chriſt we are ſetled with Chriſt; in Chriſt we are confirmed with Chriſt, which made <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay, <hi>In Chriſto ſumtis Chriſtus, extra Chriſtum, nihil. In Chriſt we are even like Chriſt, out of Chriſt we are nothing at all.</hi> To conſider this, we are to know,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="618" facs="tcp:48709:322"/>
Firſt, <hi>That all the godly through the efficacy of Gods Spirit are united to Chriſt, and ſo become his myſtical and ſpiritual body.</hi> By reaſon of this it is, that Chriſt <note place="margin">1. By grace are Chriſtians uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt.</note> dwelleth in them, and they in Chriſt; Chriſt actively communicating of his goodneſſe and virtue to them, and they paſſively receiving influences of grace from his fulneſſe. This union is repreſented in Scripture by many ſimilitudes, of a building, of a vine and branches, of an husband and wife; but none ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, as that in the Sacrament of bread and wine, denoting us thoſe elements are naturally turned into our nouriſhment, and made one with us: ſo we are in a ſpiritual and myſtical manner made one with Chriſt. This being laid as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>From this our eſtabliſhment and ſettlement followeth, whereby we are ſure to perſevere, and nothing ſhall be able to diſſolve this union;</hi> whence once <note place="margin">2. From this union follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment.</note> made a true member of Chriſt, there cannot be any ſeparation made, ſo as ever ſuch a perſon ſhould at laſt be damned in hell; for that would redound to the higheſt diſhonour of Chriſt the Head, as could be imagined. The reaſon why <hi>Adam</hi> fell, though without any inherent corruption in him, was partly becauſe he was not united to Chriſt in that manner, as the weakeſt believer is now under the Covenant of Grace. And although theſe things are derided by the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> yet this Doctrine of ſpiritual union with Chriſt, may compell every one to believe the truth thereof: ſo that if we now fall, Chriſt muſt fall with us; we are not to be conſidered as ſingle perſons, ſtanding upon our own bottome, but as united to Chriſt. Therefore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Being thus in Chriſt, our ſtabliſhment ariſeth two wayes from Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3 Our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment comes from Chriſt 1. By meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>By meritorious impetration,</hi> Chriſt as our Mediatour hath deſerved this through his propitiatory death, that we ſhould alwayes be kept his; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we have a thouſand times over deſerved, that God ſhould leave us, yet becauſe Chriſt hath deſerved that God ſhould alwayes love us, therefore it is that we ſtand faſter than Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> which yet is ſaid, not to be moved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way is by <hi>efficient application;</hi> for he doth communicate of his <note place="margin">2. By effectual application.</note> power and ſtrength to us, whereby when we are ready of our ſelves to fall, yet he doth prevent it. So that our being in Chriſt is the foundation of all ſtrength, and all comfort, and therefore this diſcovereth the wretched eſtate of ſuch who can claim no intereſt in Chriſt; theſe are toſſed up and down from one luſt to another; they roll from one iniquity to another; the Devil doth what he pleaſeth with them, he throweth them ſometimes in the fire, and ſometimes in the water, and all this is becauſe not in Chriſt. If at any time through the common graces of Gods Spirit, they are got up to the pinacle of the Temple, they are eminent for gifts and place in the Church of God, all the godly have admired them for a while; yet at laſt you find them blaſted and curſed in this way; you find them like ſwine wallowing in the mire, that were judged to be the ſheep of Chriſt. Wonder not, but ſay, they wanted the root, which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>THat which the Apoſtle called <hi>Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſhment,</hi> the great and precious worke of God upon the hearts of his people, is metaphorically declared under three ſimilitudes. The firſt is <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe the Prieſts in the Old Teſtament uſed by <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to be inaugurated into their Office, and ſometimes the Prophets alſo; as we reade of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 1 King. 19. 16. Hence <hi>Beza</hi> doth interpret this place, of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as if by <hi>us,</hi> were meant us Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he is aſſerting the dignity and excellency of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, in oppoſition to thoſe calumnies that were caſt upon</hi> Paul, <hi>and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues.</hi> This interpretation of <hi>Beza's, Stapleton</hi> doth greedily catch at, and maketh uſe thereof to oppoſe <hi>Calvin,</hi> who doth underſtand it of <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> in the general. But firſt <hi>Beza,</hi> though he thinketh the Apoſtles meaning is principally of Church-officers, yet he doth not gain-ſay, if any ſhall underſtand it of believers, comparing that place of <hi>Peter</hi> with this, where Chriſtians are ſaid to be a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. Neither doe I meet with any Popiſh Commentator, but <hi>Stapleton,</hi> that doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundit of Miniſters only. From this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to prove the <hi>Oyle</hi> or <hi>Chriſme</hi> that is uſed in Popery, when they baptize children, is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; but we may ſpeak more to that in the next verſe, where <hi>ſealing</hi> is ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The Text of it ſelf is plain; whereas in the Old Teſtament Kings and Prieſts were ſet apart for their Office, by an external anointing, which did externally repreſent ſome inward power and virtue of God poured out upon them: In the New Teſtament, this is applied to the efficacy of Gods Spirit, that is upon believers; they have all, though not a material one, yet an inviſible and ſpiritual anointing, which is the grace of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the ſoul: for they are to the ſoul, what oyl was to the body in the ſeveral effects thereof. So that we obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="620" facs="tcp:48709:323"/>
                  <hi>All true believers have a ſpiritual anointing from God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>They are Gods <hi>anointed ones.</hi> Thus <hi>Pſal. 105. 15.

                  </gap>, ſpoken of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 26. where <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid, <hi>To eſteeme the reproaches of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Aegypt; Not of Chriſt,</hi> but the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as if they were the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>anointed</hi> one in that Text: This will much gratifie the <hi>Socinian.</hi> In the New Teſtament we have a notable place to confirme this Doctrine, 1 <hi>John 2. 20. But ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 27. The anointing which you have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you.</hi> Here is the <hi>anointing</hi> or <hi>ointment,</hi> as ſome underſtand, becauſe <hi>anointing</hi> (ſay they) is a tranſient action, and ſo paſſeth away; whereas the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſomething permanent in us, we may comprehend both. Now it is good to mark the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Apoſtle having before ſpoken of the Antichriſtian party, how that deluded many by ſpecious pretences, he cometh with an adverſative, <hi>But ye have the unction;</hi> by that you are enabled to diſcerne betweene falſhood and truth: Yea ſo farre it worketh in you, that ye <hi>need not any man ſhould teach you;</hi> that is (ſay ſome) not excluſively, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; for ſo a negative expreſſion is ſometimes uſed: If there be not this unction from God, all humane teaching is in vain. So that as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> and others well obſerve, he doth not ſpeak here againſt the uſe of the Miniſtry, as <hi>Illuminatiſts,</hi> and others pretend. For then why ſhould the Apoſtle teach them in this Epiſtle, while he ſaith, <hi>They need no man to teach them?</hi> Again, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the fundamentals and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of Religion; as if he had ſaid, <hi>You are not ſo rude and ignorant, as to be taught the principles;</hi> for ſo all Chriſtians growne up, ſhould not need a Miniſtry for plantation, and a foundation, but edification and further inſtruction. Therefore becauſe the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> were negligent herein, how ſeverely doth the Apoſtle reprove them, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6? Further, the meaning may be, <hi>Ye need not any other man,</hi> that is of the heretical way, ſhould teach you, you have received the truth of God from us, you need not goe to them to be inſtructed. Thus the Orthodox may ſay, We have informed you in the ſound knowledge of God, you need not to go to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to <hi>Socinians</hi> for more light and truth.</p>
               <p>By this Text we ſee, that though <hi>anointing</hi> doth chiefly referre to the worke of grace, yet it alſo comprehends <hi>knowledge;</hi> for <hi>Oyle</hi> was uſed to keep up the light of their lampes; and therefore Prieſts and Prophets were anointed. So that this very expreſſion is very noble and magnificent, <hi>You are the anointed ones of God: if you doe truly believe, you have an unction from the holy one.</hi> Now how will this title be applied to ignorant and prophane perſons? Have they this choice <hi>anointing?</hi> May you not call a dunghill ſweet ointment as well?</p>
               <p>But to enlarge this excellent point, we muſt</p>
               <p>Firſt, Know, <hi>Who is the fountain of this ſpiritual ointment;</hi> and the Text ſaith, <hi>It is God. John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The holy one,</hi> that is, the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> who <note place="margin">1. Who is the fountain of this ointment, even God and Chriſt.</note> therefore hath his name <hi>Meſſias</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he is anointed as the Head, and then (as from <hi>Aaron's</hi> head) it runneth downe to his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; he is the <hi>anointed Head,</hi> and we the <hi>anointed Members.</hi> Whether this <hi>anointing</hi> of Chriſt referreth to his Divine Nature, or Humane, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:48709:323"/>
not to be diſputed; for it is certaine it belongeth to him as <hi>God-man.</hi> Hence <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 61. 1. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath anointed me to preach the Gospel. Acts</hi> 10. 38. God is there ſaid, <hi>To anoint Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power.</hi> So that this <hi>anointing of Chriſt</hi> was in him, as in us, the cauſe of all that power and vertue we doe partake of. Therefore when it is ſaid <hi>(Pſalm. 45. verſ.</hi> 7.) of Chriſt, <hi>Thou loveſt righteouſneſſe, and hateſt iniquity; therefore God hath anointed thee with oyle of gladneſſe above thy fellowes.</hi> That is not an argument <hi>à priori;</hi> as if therefore Chriſt were <hi>anointed,</hi> becauſe he loved righteouſneſſe, but <hi>à<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>poſteriori</hi> by way of ſigne and manifeſtation; hereby it was made known, that he was the anointed of God. Thus the <hi>ſpiritual anointing</hi> of Gods people is the cauſe of all that fragrancy and ſweet ſmell that is in their lives.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us compare the properties of material oyle with this ſpiritual</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon betwixt material, and this ſpiritual oyl. They are like, 1. As oyl was uſed in the conſecration of things to God.</note> 
                  <hi>anointing.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, It was uſed (as you heard) <hi>in ſetting apart of Kings and Prieſts for their Office; yea moſt things in the Temple were conſecrated by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing of them.</hi> So that they were not afterwards to be converted to any common uſe; neither might any take of the <hi>ointment</hi> that the Prieſt was anointed with, and apply it to other matters. Now this denoteth both the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> of all true believers. The <hi>Dignity,</hi> they are Gods anointed ones, therefore touch them not, for God will avenge their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; by this we are both <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts; Kings</hi> ſpiritually conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, as alſo our owne luſts and ſinnes. Shalt thou who art a King over thy paſſions be a ſlave to them? And then we are alſo <hi>Prieſts,</hi> becauſe we are to offer up ſoule and body, as a Sacrifice unto God: we are not to live to our ſelves, but to him. Againe, here is our <hi>Duty,</hi> for we being thus Gods anointed ones, his conſecrated ones, we muſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to luſts and ſinnes, or defile our ſelves with the pitch that is in the world. Shall a man with this ſpiritual anointing roll himſelfe in the mire and vomit of ſinne? What pride and curioſity hath been uſed about ointments for ſmell and beauty? Inſomuch that the very Poet could ſay, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le olet, qui benè olet.</hi> May not this ſhame every godly Chriſtian, to think how much vain and proud perſons do regard ſuch precious ointments, that are for the body only, above what thou doeſt for ſoul-ointment, and the ſpiritual excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency thereof?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Oyle was uſed to comfort the heart of a man, and beautifie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. As it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the heart and beautifies the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> 
                  <hi>the countenance.</hi> Therefore <hi>(Pſalm.</hi> 45.) it is called, <hi>The oile of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Hence it was that in their Feaſts and Nuptial banquets, they <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> themſelves. The <hi>oyle of gladneſſe</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>mourning;</hi> and in this ſenſe the Spirit of God may well be compared to <hi>oyle;</hi> for he is the <hi>Comforter</hi> as well as the <hi>Sanctifier.</hi> And this is part of the meaning in the Text, at leaſt by way of conſequent. For where the Spirit of God doth witneſſe and ſeale to the true believer, that is many times accompanied with great joy and conſolation. <hi>Ointment and perfume rejoyce the heart,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 27. 9.) How much more will thoſe inward and effectual operations of Gods Spirit? It is true, joy and reall godlineſſe are many times ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one another. The chariots of a godly ſoule, many times goe heavily for want of this oyle in the wheeles. Onely we are to know, that there is an aptitude and fitneſſe in the connexion betweene grace and conſolation, godlineſſe and delight. Pray therefore for this anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Spirit, even to fill thy heart with <hi>joy unspeakable.</hi> For this will make thee like <hi>Elijah,</hi> goe to Heaven in a fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot.
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:48709:324"/>
Thy duties, thy performances, theſe will have more vigour and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Oyle was uſed to refreſh thoſe that were weary.</hi> The <hi>Jewes</hi> did uſe it to thoſe who travailed, by way of reſtauration (as it were) to <note place="margin">3. As it refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> them. Thus <hi>(Luke</hi> 7. 46.) that woman <hi>anointed Chriſts feet with oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This was done for refocillation after laſſitude. And thus alſo the Spirit of God, with his gracious effects, doth wonderfully exhilarate and cheer the heart after many weariſome labours and temptations. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not ſo much ſubject to wearineſſe and reſtleſneſſe, as the ſoule is. The way to Heaven is a ſtreight and narrow way. Hence the Spirit of God is like <hi>ointment</hi> to refreſh us in theſe laborious exerciſes: arguments taken from the nature of the Goſpel, from the excellency and uſefulneſſe of Gods promiſes; theſe doe adminiſter much ſpiritual eaſe and content to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Oyle was uſed to thoſe who were wounded, as being of ſpecial operation to heale their wounds.</hi> Therefore <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 34. the <hi>good Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. As it healeth wounds.</note> 
                  <hi>tooke oyle and poured it into the wounds</hi> of that man of <hi>Jericho.</hi> And now that man was but once wounded, whereas the godly man receiveth many wounds ſeveral wayes; ſometimes through his owne careleſneſſe, and negligence, he wounds his owne heart ſadly; ſometimes God for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ends ſeemeth to wound him with the wounds of an angry one. Oh then how bleſſed is it to have <hi>oyle</hi> poured into theſe bleeding wounds! Yet of ſuch ſuppling and mollifying efficacy is the Spirit of God to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted conſciences for ſinne. And if you aske, What is this oyle that is to be poured into ſuch wounds? I anſwer, It is the <hi>balme of Gilead,</hi> the oyle of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the <hi>precious promiſes</hi> that are in Chriſt. The Spirit of God doth anoint the ſoul with this <hi>oyle,</hi> and thereby the heart recovereth of thoſe ſad and deadly wounds which the Law, and the guilt of ſinne had made upon it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Oyntment hath its peculiar ſmell and fragrancy, it recreateth the noſtrils of others.</hi> Not onely they that have the ointment, but others <note place="margin">5. In that it is delightſom to the noſtrils.</note> that are in company partake of the ſmell thereof. Therefore we reade of the Church, <hi>(Cantic. 1. 3. Chap.</hi> 4. 10.) ſo greatly affected with the <hi>ſmell of Chriſts ointments.</hi> What is that, but onely the lovelineſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the Lord Chriſt, which a gracious ſoul is ſo deeply affected with? For this it is, that the <hi>Virgins are ſaid to love him.</hi> By <hi>Virgins</hi> are meant ſincere and upright perſons, theſe follow Chriſt becauſe of the ſavour of his ointments. It is not any carnal advantage, or worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but the meere preciouſneſſe that is in him, as a Mediatour, and as the husband of the ſoule, that maketh the godly thus preſſe after him. Now as it is thus with Chriſt, ſo it ought to be with Chriſtians. As a man cannot hide the ſmell of his ointments, but others will be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; ſo it ought to be with a Chriſtian; all his whole life ſhould be a ſweet ſavour, and a precious odour; there ſhould be that in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which ſhould make every one that beholdeth him to be in love with him: They ſhould love to be in his company, in his preſence. As they ſay of the Dove, when it hath any precious ointment poured on it, it maketh all the reſt flocke after it. Eſpecially this ſhould make all the godly take heed of thoſe things that will make Religion to ſtinke, or their perſons to be vile and abominable before others. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A dead flie falling into a box of ointment, will make it to ſtinke,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 1. If a <hi>dead flie,</hi> what then will a dead toad, or a piece of a dead dogge? Such carrion muſt needs make a man to be abhorred. The very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:48709:324"/>
that thou art anointed, ought to work upon thee ſo farre, as to do nothing that may make thee to be abhorred.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Oyle was uſed to mollifie and ſoften things that were harſh</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. As it molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſtiffe.</hi> So <hi>(Iſaiah</hi> 10. 27.) the yoke is ſaid to be deſtroyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the anointing. Thus the graces of Gods Spirit are to the ſoule, they ſoften and mollifie the hardneſſe of thy heart. How oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en doth it melt thy ſtubborne ſoule, and make thee kindly relent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all that ſubbornneſſe and diſobedience which thou haſt ſhewed to God?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Oyle was uſed to comfort and ſtrengthen men in their limbs.</hi> And <note place="margin">7. As it ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and comforts the limbs.</note> therefore thoſe who were accuſtomed to bodily exerciſes, did make much uſe of it. It was neceſſary to combate and conflict with enemies. Thus alſo it is here; all Chriſtians are called to a ſpiritual wartare, and that with principalities and powers in high places, as well as with fleſh and blood. They are continually to put on their armour againſt all the aſſaults of the Devil. Now this could not be done, unleſſe we had this <hi>oyle,</hi> this <hi>anointing</hi> from the Spirit of God. In the Spirit of God, we are to goe out againſt all the aſſaults and temptations of Satan. In the name of Chriſt, we are to ſet upon theſe <hi>Goliahs.</hi> How many have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in this battel, even of Gods own people? becauſe they had not this eſtabliſhing grace ready at hand. Doe not thinke to get into Heaven without a ſore conflict with <hi>Anakims</hi> in the way. There muſt be a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe and a red Sea to paſſe through, before thou canſt enter into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> And therefore for this end, have we this <hi>anointing,</hi> whereby we may be the more confirmed; and <hi>having done all things, to ſtand,</hi> as it is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 13. What more is to be ſaid to this point, will come in upon the other metaphorical termes.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us improve this. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We ſee what a glorious and excellent title the name of a Chriſtian is,</hi> for that ſignifieth as much as one <hi>anointed.</hi> If thou art a Chriſtian in deed, as well as in name, thou haſt this <hi>anointing and unction</hi> that is here ſpoken of. How farre then are all prophane and wretched ſinners from the reality of this name? What have they to doe with the name, who are ſo contrary to the thing it ſelf? Art thou <hi>anointed,</hi> that ſmelleſt of the very flames of hell? Thy tongue, thy actions doe all diſcover it. There are no ſonnes of <hi>Boanerges</hi> that can thunder terribly enough againſt ſuch reproaches and diſhonours, yea blaſphemies to the holy name and profeſſion of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe 2. Of Inſtruction.</hi> What is a ſpecial preſervative againſt all hereſies and damnable opinions? even this <hi>ſpiritual unction.</hi> For that doth not onely illuminate the minde, but ſanctifie the heart alſo. And if a man have never ſo much knowledge by education, and other meanes, if he hath not alſo this ſpiritual teaching, he is a ready prey for the Devil. Onely you muſt know, that this unction is not ſpeedily, and in an inſtant accompliſhed in the people of God, it is ſucceſſively, and by degrees. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it was with the Lord Chriſt, though he was anointed to be the Lord of his people, and he had the right to this even from his Incarnation, yet the actual exerciſe, and manifeſtation of this was not compleated, till his Aſcenſion into his glory. Thus the <hi>ſpiritual unction</hi> of Gods people will not be fully finiſhed, till they are made perfect in Heaven. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the preſent, both their knowledge, and their graces are but in part; which conſideration ſhould keepe us from being ſcandalized; if we ſee that even thoſe believers, who yet have all received this uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:48709:325"/>
from God, if in things not fundamentall they differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe 3. Of Exhortation, To wicked men, to take heed how they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, or oppoſe theſe anointed ones;</hi> how contemptible and vile they may be in thy eyes, it is no matter; you ſee how the Lord hath dignified them, he hath ſet his mark upon them: what you doe againſt them, he taketh as done againſt himſelfe; they are as the <hi>apple of his eye. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when but cutting off a piece of <hi>Saul</hi>'s garment, was ſmitten in his heart, becauſe he was the <hi>Lords anointed;</hi> yet that was onely an external unction, <hi>Saul</hi> had not the ſpiritual anointing. Do thou therefore take heed of reproaching, deriding and perſecuting ſuch as God hath anointed with the graces of his Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe 4. Of Admonition to all the Godly,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>doe nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitably to this anointing.</hi> Hereſies and impieties doe not agree with this excellent compoſition. Thy ſpiritual ointment is to diſcover it ſelfe in all companies, in all temptations, in all exerciſes. The more, precious <hi>ointment</hi> is ſtirred, the ſweeter it ſmelleth: So the more God afflicteth thee, chaſtizeth thee, the more he doth pound thee (as it were) in the mortar, the more doth thy preciouſneſſe manifeſt thy ſelfe. We reade, <hi>(Matthew</hi> 26. 7, 13.) that when a woman poured an <hi>Alabaſter box of precious ointment</hi> upon Chriſts head, that Chriſt did ſo farre encourage her, that he ſaid, <hi>Whereſoever the Gospel ſhould be preached, there alſo ſhould this, that the woman had done, for a memorial of her.</hi> And yet when thou confeſſeſt Chriſt in the midſt of a wicked generation, when thou art ready to part with all for Chriſt, when he requireth it, thou doeſt more for Chriſt, than this woman did. Look then to thy ſelf, that all thoughts, all words and actions favour of this ointment; whatſoever is of ſinne and luſt within thee, thinke that is of the dung-hill, that is of vomit and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy mire.</p>

               <p>WE come to the ſecond noble Priviledge which the Apoſtle attributeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for although we told you the ſame benefit is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under three metaphoricall ſimilitudes, yet every one of them hath a diſtinct notion, as this of <hi>ſealing</hi> hath from that of <hi>anointing,</hi> though both intend the confirmation and eſtabliſhment mentioned in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe: Some Popiſh Writers would from hence prove their ſpurious non-inſtituted Sacraments, as by <hi>anointing</hi> they would have their <hi>oylin baptiſm;</hi> as alſo in their <hi>extreme unction</hi> eſtabliſhed; and by <hi>ſealing</hi> their <hi>Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> wherein likewiſe they uſe their <hi>chriſme</hi> and <hi>oil,</hi> blaſphemouſly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it <hi>oleum ſalutis, the oyl of ſalvation.</hi> Hence they tell us <hi>confirmation</hi> is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually called in antiquity <hi>ſignaculum,</hi> and the <hi>obſignation of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> bringing this Text for the proof thereof, as <hi>Vicecomes</hi> a great Popiſh Ritualiſt, <hi>lib. 1. &amp; 2. de confirmatione,</hi> would make us beleeve: but firſt this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion confuteth that of <hi>Stapleton,</hi> who limits the interpretation to Miniſters only; whereas <hi>Baptiſm, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>extreme Unction</hi> were applyed to private Chriſtians: and ſecondly, they are never yet able to prove any ſuch Sacrament, of <hi>confirmation,</hi> as they ſpeak of: Indeed in Antiquity there was <hi>Confirmation</hi> uſed in the Church of God; When perſons baptized in their infancy were afterwards by Church-officers called to account about their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Chriſtian life; wherein if approved, they were commended by prayer to God for their eſtabliſhment in the Chriſtian faith againſt all perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions and oppoſitions: The uſe whereof <hi>Calvin</hi> wiſheth were brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the Church of God; as being advantagious to prevent hereſies, as alſo to reprove the careleſneſſe and negligence of parents about the education of their children; but as for that abominable abuſe of this afterwards in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, making a <hi>Sacrament</hi> thereof, adding thereunto many Popiſh and ridiculous ceremonies; This is a noiſome weed, not any plant of Gods planting: We are therefore to enquire what is the <hi>Sealing</hi> that here beleevers are ſaid to have from God, and that will appear to be a metaphor taken from men, who for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ends make uſe of <hi>ſeals,</hi> and ſo accordingly it is to be applyed to that work of Gods ſpirit, which is in the hearts of beleevers: All which will better appear in the opening of the doctrine, which is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the people of God are his ſealed ones.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The people of God are his ſealed ones. 1. There is an active and a paſſive ſealing.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To improve which truth, Conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That we reade of an active ſealing and a paſſive ſealing:</hi> An <hi>active ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
                  <pb n="626" facs="tcp:48709:326"/>
is, when we by profeſſion or otherwiſe do give our Teſtimony to the Truths of God, for when a man receiveth the Word of God as his Truth, and doth accordingly manifeſt this in his life; herein he doth ſeal to God: So the <hi>Evangeliſt John, chap 3. 33. He that hath received his Testimony, hath ſet to his ſeal that God is true.</hi> By which expreſſion, you ſee of what neceſſity faith in the Word of God is, with the profeſſion thereof in our lives: It is a <hi>ſealing that God is true:</hi> inſomuch that he who beleeveth not, as much as in him lieth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth God a lyar. Oh conſider this, thou who art tempted to unbeleef, to diſtruſt, not to reſt upon the Promiſes of God. What an hainous ſin is this, not to give teſtimony to Gods Truth? but this we are not to ſpeak of: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a <hi>paſſive ſealing,</hi> which we reade applyed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to all <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: To Chriſt,</hi> thus <hi>Joh. 6, 27. For him hath God the Father ſealed:</hi> How was that? when by the wonderfull miracles that were wrought, he was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the Meſſias. And then for <hi>beleevers</hi> they are ſaid to be ſealed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this place, but <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. Thus you ſee the people of God have a <hi>ſealing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the next place, <hi>Gods ſealing of his people is twofold, either viſible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,</hi> externall or internall; Gods <hi>viſible ſealing</hi> was again twofold, <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Gods ſealing of his people is either vifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or invifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> or <hi>ordinary; extraordinary</hi> were the miracles and wonderful ſignes, which many beleevers did in the firſt plantation of the Goſpel: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> cals miracles the <hi>ſignes of his Apoſtleſhip, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 12. and they are ſaid to be a <hi>ſign to thoſe that beleeve not, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 22. Now ſome would have this <hi>ſealing,</hi> which beleevers are ſaid to receive, meant of theſe extraordinary miracles, which were viſible to the world; but that cannot be, partly becauſe all true beleevers in thoſe dayes had them not, and ſome who were not true beleevers did partake of them; and partly becauſe that was but for a ſeaſon, while the Goſpel was firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: whereas the Scripture ſpeaketh of ſuch a <hi>ſealing,</hi> as the godly may have in all ages, even till their redemption.</p>
               <p>In the next place there are viſible <hi>ordinary ſeals,</hi> ſuch are the <hi>two Sacraments of baptiſm</hi> and <hi>the Lords Supper;</hi> for as <hi>circumciſion</hi> is called <hi>Rom. 4. 11. the ſeal of the righteouſneſte of faith,</hi> ſo that is to be applyed to every other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being of the genericall nature thereof: It is true, the Apoſtle in this Text and other places, may happily allude to this <hi>Sealing</hi> in the Sacrament, which is viſible and externall; but becauſe the outward application of theſe is to the unregenerate and hypocrite, as well as the truly godly: therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle meaneth a further thing, even ſome proper priviledge that is peculiar to the godly only, and that <hi>inviſibly</hi> or <hi>ſpiritually</hi> in our hearts, as the next words ſhew, <hi>the earneſt of the spirit in our hearts;</hi> So that as the <hi>anointing</hi> is a <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inviſible</hi> thing, thus alſo muſt the <hi>ſealing</hi> be: Therefore before we come to declare the nature and uſe of this obſignation: Let us conſider what is implied in the metaphor of <hi>ſealing,</hi> for thereby we ſhall in part be brought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the admirable nature thereof.</p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>Sealing of the godly,</hi> doth imply <hi>the precious and excellent eſteem</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tee god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implys. 1. The great eſteem with God.</note> 
                  <hi>they have with God;</hi> for ſo amongſt men, thoſe things are ſealed up by us, as we account precious: None uſe to ſeal up dung and pibbles in a bag. Thus <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 23. God promiſeth <hi>Zerubbabel, he will make him as a ſignet, becauſe he had choſen him,</hi> that is, he ſhould be very precious and dear to him as the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in a ring. Therefore we have that expreſſion, <hi>Jer. 22. 22. Though Coniah were the ſignet of my right hand</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>yet I would pluck him from thence,</hi> that is, though never ſo dear to him; We have alſo the Church praying, <hi>Can. 8. 6. Set me as a ſeal upon thy heart, as a ſeal upon thy arm:</hi> As theſe who dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love any were wont to have their image engraven upon the rings they did wear on heir hands, to have them continually in remembrance. Thus the Church prayeth that ſhe may be put as a ſeal even upon the heart of Chriſt: ſo
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:48709:326"/>
that by this expreſſion is meant the preciouſneſſe, the high eſteem God hath of them; they are his Jewels, they are his peculiar treaſure; and therefore it is that he doth thus ſeal them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sealing is for the <hi>ſafety and preſervation</hi> of <hi>any ohing,</hi> that we would not <note place="margin">2. Their ſafety</note> have loſt. Thus <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 17. when <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt into priſon, there was a ſtone laid upon the mouth of the den, and the King <hi>ſealed it</hi> with his own ſignet, that ſo there might be no hope of having <hi>Daniel</hi> releaſed; and thus God <hi>ſealeth</hi> his people by ſpecial grace preſerving them, that they ſhall never totally and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be loſt, though Satan be never ſo watchful to deſtroy them: They are <hi>ſealed,</hi> and therefore they ſhall certainly perſevere; but becauſe this will come more fully in the next particular, I paſſe it over.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sealing doth not only imply ſafety, but ſecurity alſo againſt ſuch danger</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Security.</note> 
                  <hi>that is imminent upon us:</hi> God ſealeth his people, that the deſtruction which is conſuming of others may paſſe them by. Thus we reade in <hi>Ezechiel, cap.</hi> 9. 4. when the Angel was to deſtroy the inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet there was a command given to ſet a mark upon the foreheads of ſuch as did ſigh and cry for the abominations thereof: When the <hi>Egyptians</hi> likewiſe were to be deſtroyed, they paſſed by every houſe that had blood ſprinkled upon the poſts thereof. <hi>Rahabs</hi> red thread was like a <hi>ſeal</hi> to preſerve her from deſtruction, and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 7, 4. we reade of many thouſands of Gods ſervants <hi>ſealed in the foreheads;</hi> and they were therefore <hi>ſealed,</hi> that they might be preſerved from deſolation: This ſealing was not any external mark, no more than the mark of the beaſt was, but that reall profeſſion of Chriſt which they put forth in the midſt of all dangers, not defiling themſelves with the impurities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And thus God doth ſtill <hi>ſeal</hi> his people, that <hi>Satan</hi> though he deſire to winnow and ſift them, yet is not able to devour them as his prey. Oh what unſpeakable mercy is this, when the juſtice of God goeth with a drawn ſword to throw ſuch and ſuch into hell, he paſſeth by thee becauſe thou art one of Gods ſealed people.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Sealing is for the differencing and diſcriminating of perſons;</hi> Thus <note place="margin">4. Their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from others.</note> the Shepherd ſetteth a proper mark to know his own ſheep by: The Souldier he hath his proper badge and colours to diſcern what Generall he belongeth unto: And in this ſenſe, though not principally, the Sacraments are ſeals; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are acknowledged to be the Lords people, and ſo differenced from all that are enemies and ſtrangers to him, but this is more remarkably ſeen in this <hi>ſpirituall ſealing,</hi> for thereby we are not only diſtinguiſhed from the heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh world, but from every hypocrite in the Church of God: Though many may go ſar in profeſſion, in parts, in gifts, ſo as to be admirable in the eyes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of others, yet none have this <hi>ſealing</hi> but the truly godly man. Every gifted man is not this <hi>ſealed</hi> beleever; None hath this but the true childe of God: The ſpirit of God doth not <hi>ſeal,</hi> but where it hath ſanctified; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This <hi>ſealing</hi> doth ſuppoſe the work of grace truly wrought in a man, <hi>Sealing</hi> doth not make him godly properly, but ſuppoſeth him ſo: Thus <hi>Eph. 1. 13. after ye beleeved ye were ſealed:</hi> there was firſt the work of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then of obſignation. It is true <hi>Zanchy</hi> upon that place maketh <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to be the impreſſion of grace upon the heart, even as in <hi>ſealing</hi> the print of the <hi>ſeal</hi> is ſtamped upon the wax; and ſo farre we may yeeld that the encreaſe of grace and confirmation therein is a <hi>ſealing of the ſpirit;</hi> but yet to ſpeak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly this <hi>ſealing</hi> is after the work of grace in the ſoul: Even as it is in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: The externall <hi>ſigne</hi> or <hi>ſeal</hi> doth not make the promiſe, but ſuppoſeth it, ſo in this inward <hi>ſealing,</hi> grace is not thereby wrought in us, unleſſe it be in the further degrees thereof, but doth confirm that which is in us: and thus ſeals are to confirm contracts, not make them as is to be ſhewed; yet though
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:48709:327"/>
it be not the divine impreſſion of grace, yet this ſeal is alwaies ſuppoſed; God doth not ſet to his ſeal to a blank, and hereby this ſealing is diſtinguiſhed from all carnal preſumption, and the deluſions of Satan, for the devil hath as it were his ſealing, he confirmeth and eſtabliſheth men in hereticall doctrines, and they are ready to take this for the obſignation of Gods own ſpirit; when heretiques give their bodies to be burnt, profeſſing they have much peace and joy of conſcience; Here the Kings Seal is conterfeited, as it were; They make a diabolicall deluſion, to be the holy ſealing of Gods Spirit. Thus as in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, there is the true work of Gods grace, and a counterfeit, that which doth reſemble and is like it; ſo in the witneſſing and <hi>ſealing</hi> of Gods Spirit, there alſo may be a reſemblance of it, which yet is not that glorious priviledge indeed: only as a man that is awake doth certainly know he is ſo, and not in a dream, though men in a dream imagine themſelves to be awake, when they are deceived. Thus where the <hi>ſealing</hi> of Gods Spirit is, there the authority and light of it doth powerfully diſcover it ſelf to be of God: even as the Sun by its own light doth diſcover it ſelf to be the Sun; though they that think they have it may be deceived, yet thoſe that have it are ſure they do enjoy it. Hence</p>
               <p>Sixthly, This <hi>ſealing</hi> doth <hi>imply ſecrecy and privacy;</hi> That which is cloſely <note place="margin">6. Secrecy and privacy.</note> reſerved, as <hi>Deut. 32. 34. Is not this laid up in ſtore with me, and ſealed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my treaſures?</hi> ſaith God. Thus alſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>cap. 14. 17. his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſealed up in a bag;</hi> God did take ſpeciall notice of it in time to puniſh it; Now in this ſenſe alſo we may apply this <hi>ſealing</hi> of Gods Spirit: It is very ſecret, hidden and unknown, and that in a twofold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The nature of it is a <hi>myſtery,</hi> and hardly unfolded; Inſomuch that as the <hi>lamb</hi> in the Revelation was found only worthy to open the ſeals. Thus onely men enlightned by the Spirit of God, and experimentally taught of him, can ſavourily explain this. Come to the Learned and moſt eminent men devoid of ſpirituall diſcerning, and whoſe ſenſes are not exerciſed evangelically, who have not the Spirit of Adoption effectually working in them, and they can no more ſpeak with underſtanding to this point, then <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of regeneration. He will ſay with thoſe in the Prophet <hi>Iſay, cap. 29. 11. I cannnot reade this book, for it is ſealed.</hi> But then</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecrecy of it is diſcovered, becauſe <hi>none know what it is, but he that hath it.</hi> As none knoweth what Parents affections are but parents; none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what love is, but he that loveth: So none know what this ſealing of Gods Spirit is, but he that doth partake of it: Therefore this ſealing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to other things, <hi>Rev. 2. 17. to the hidden manna:</hi> There was the <hi>manna</hi> that did fall from heaven, of which all did eat promiſcuouſly; and then there was <hi>the manna hidden in the ark.</hi> The godly man is ſaid to eat of this: It is likewiſe called the <hi>white ſtone,</hi> which is a note of abſolution, and juſtification when accuſed, and that with a <hi>new name upon it, which none knoweth, ſave he that receiveth it.</hi> By this expreſſion it is clear, that the nature and efficacy of of this Sealing is underſtood only by thoſe who enjoy it; and therefore no unregenerate man is able to conceive rightly about it, no more than a blinde man can about the Sunne: yea, the godly man himſelf, though he feel it, yet he cannot expreſſe it to another: Even as we cannot expreſſe the life we live unto another; we feel it, but cannot deſcribe it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Which is the chiefeſt of all, and moſt principally intended in this expreſſion, <hi>Sealing was to confirm and ſecure all contracts and bargains made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">7. Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>men.</hi> Thus <hi>Ieremiah cap.</hi> 32. 10. when he purchaſed ſome land, he had the evidence <hi>ſealed:</hi> In which reſpect ſome underſtand that place, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The foundation of the Lord standeth ſure having this ſeal:</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">

be <hi>ſealed,</hi> but a <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>bargain;</hi> to which a <hi>ſeal</hi> is annexed, but that is not ſo probable; only in the generall, <hi>ſeals</hi> are chiefly to ſecure and confirm: and for this end it is, that we have the Spirit of God <hi>ſealing;</hi> for the ſenſe of our unworthineſſe and guilt doth make us very propenſe to diffidence, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, to continuall fears about Gods love to us: and therefore as we need the Spirit of God to ſanctifie us, ſo alſo to witneſſe and ſeal unto us, which is more largely to be treated of.</p>

               <p>WHat is comprehended in the expreſſion of <hi>ſealing</hi> hath been already declared: I ſhall therefore in the next place conſider of, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſome equivalent Texts of Scripture with this, and then from thoſe conjoyned we may be able to finde out the nature of this <hi>obſignation;</hi> for although our principall endeavour is to be made partaker of it, yet it is very neceſſary in its kinde to know what it is: Though it cannot be denied but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods people may have it, and yet not give the definition of it; Even as they may beleeve and be regenerated, and not happily be able to give an exact deſcription of theſe things. As many a man hath health, may ſleep well, and <note place="margin">Scriptures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to the text. Rom. 8. 18.</note> yet is not able to tell you, what health or ſleep is.</p>
               <p>The firſt Text, which will afford much light to this we are upon, is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place ſet like a beacon upon the mount, and much agitated between Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Proteſtants in the doctrine of aſſurance, <hi>Rom. 8. 18. where the ſpirit it ſelf</hi> is ſaid <hi>to bear witneſſe with our spirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> I ſhall not inſiſt upon the controverſies on this place, either grammaticall or reall, but take the poſitive truth plainly delivered: Here the godly, who all have <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> firſt ſanctifying and leading them on in all their waies, whereby they are ſaid to be ſpiritually minded, are in the next place declared to have the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> in another manner working upon them, and that is <hi>to witneſſe with our ſpirit.</hi> So that the ſpirits Teſtimony is not ſingle and immediate, as when there was a voice heard, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne.</hi> No ſuch Enthuſiaſtical impreſſions and impulſes are to be dreamed of, but mediately and conjunctly with our ſpirits; By it our conſciences are ſo enlightned that we are thereby enabled to be perſwaded, that we are the Children of God; for that you ſee is the object of the Teſtimony, that is the matter wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, <hi>that we are the children of God.</hi> You ſee then, here is no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Popiſh doctrine of doubting; nay, when they go the higheſt, allowing a moral certitude, ſuch which excludeth all fear to the contrary, yet it doth not riſe up high enough to this glorious priviledge ſpoken of. For as with the ſpirit in Sanctification of us, moral vertues came far ſhort of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:48709:328"/>
and fruit of the ſpirit; So doth an humane perſwaſion from the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our conſcience within us, of this <hi>witneſſing and ſealing of Gods Spirit.</hi>

               <p>A ſecond Text reducible to this, is <hi>Gal. 4. 6.

                  </gap>ſels, doſt prophanely deſpiſe this priviledge; ſo neither doth God give ſuch childrens bread to dogs, or Pearls to ſwine. Again, <hi>God hath ſent the ſpirit of his Sonne,</hi> you ſee our <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> is built upon Chriſts <hi>Sonſhip;</hi> our <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> of Adoption is eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Son-ſhip</hi> which is by nature in him. He doth not ſpeak here of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne, but a temporal one beſtowed on beleevers; and he ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit of his Son,</hi> becauſe by Chriſts death this ſpirit in its peculiar operation, is as it were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for the godly: For had not Chriſt made an atonement, the Spirit of God could not have been given us, either for ſanctification or conſolation. Further, <hi>This is ſent into our hearts,</hi> not into our memories or mindes only; for the temporary beleever hath ſome ſuperficial and vaniſhing perſwaſion of Gods favour towards him; but it is <hi>ſent into our hearts,</hi> implying the full, deep, and through poſſeſſion that it hath of the godly. Laſtly, Here is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and glorious effect, <hi>it maketh us to cry,</hi> that is, fervently, confidently, and boldly; <hi>God, Father; Abba, Father.</hi> Some reade it indicatively in this ſenſe, <hi>God is my Father;</hi> Some by way of wiſh and prayer; it cometh all to one. Theſe are two words ſignifying the ſame thing, teaching us; that both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> is indulged this priviledge, or elſe it's germinated for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſake: Oh then how unquiet and reſtleſſe ſhould the people of God be, till they finde this work of <hi>the ſpirit of Adoption</hi> upon them? Thou daily enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt after the ſpirit in its ſanctification of thee, how it maketh thee more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, how it mortifieth thy luſts; and doſt mourn becauſe thou doſt not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it in a greater meaſure. Why doth not thy ſoul alſo long after the fruit of this <hi>ſpirit of Adoption</hi> in thee? Doſt thou obſerve how it ſubdueth thy ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fears? how it inclineth thee to a filiall and Evangelicall affection towards God as a Father? I tell thee, thy life is never a Goſpel-life till this be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As therefore theſe blinde men cryed, <hi>Jeſus have mercy on us,</hi> though the Diſciples reproved them, and bid them hold their peace; ſo alſo let it be with thee: whatſoever temptations, guilt and fears, thy heart ſuggeſteth to the contrary, do thou notwithſtanding boldly cry, <hi>God my Father.</hi>

               <p>The third Text to illuſtrate this, 1 <hi>Cor. 2, 12. Now we have received, not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> Here we ſee two principles oppoſed as contrary to one another, <hi>the ſpirit of the world, and the ſpirit of God;</hi> and he who hath the ſpirit of God, hath it for this end partly, that he might <hi>know the things which God hath freely given him;</hi> implying, that without this ſpirit we could not diſcern of theſe things: Even as if a man had not a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſoul beſtowed upon him, he could not diſcern the things of reaſon, but would be as a beaſt. So did not God beſtow his ſpirit upon us, we were no wayes able to diſcern of thoſe Goſpel-mercies which are beſtowed upon us. He ſaith, <hi>which are freely given us, us</hi> in particular, that we might not think he ſpeaketh of the priviledges of the Goſpel in the generall, remiſſion of ſins, and ſanctification in the generall, but as applyed to this and that ſubject: So that if a man have no more than the ſpirit of the world, if he have not as yet
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:48709:328"/>
this ſpirit of God, dwelling in him, he is not a fit auditor for this truth. If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought not young perſons fit auditors for his morall Philoſophy, how much more are we to judge every man, though of never ſuch abilities and parts, yet if deſtitute of the ſpirit of God, altogether incapable of this truth? Therefore the ſpiritual hearers are only ſuch who can give their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to theſe things. There muſt be a ſpiritual life, a ſpiritual foundation, before there can be this ſpiritual ſuperſtruction.</p>
               <p>A fourth Text is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 24. and indeed that Apoſtle doth often ſpeak to <note place="margin">1 Joh 3. 24.</note> this ſealing of Gods Spirit upon the hearts of beleevers, though in other terms. This I have mentioned is pregnant; for having ſaid, <hi>that he who keepeth Gods Commandements, dwelleth in him, and he in him.</hi> Whereas it might be ſaid, how ſhall we know that he dwelleth in us? May we not be deluded and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? <hi>No</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hereby we know that he abideth in us by the ſpirit which he hath given us:</hi> and leſt any man, though living looſely and carnally, ſhould pretend to this ſpirit, he ſaith, <hi>They that have it keep his Commandements.</hi> Thus doubtings and ſinnefull diffidence is excluded on one hand, and all carnal preſumption on the other hand.</p>
               <p>The laſt Text to bring in aſſiſtance to this truth, ſhall be, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 8, <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 8, 9, 10.</note> 9, 10. where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>three Witneſſes</hi> on earth, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in heaven, viz. <hi>water, and the bloud, and the ſpirit.</hi> Now although there be many perplexed controverſies about this paſſage, yet I ſhall pitch upon that which is moſt probable, without further diſquieting of you. It ſeemeth to be without doubt that the Apoſtle alludeth to the legall adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein there was bloud for expiation, and water for cleanſing: by which is repreſented juſtification and ſanctification; and theſe being wrought in us, do evidently witneſſe, that <hi>Jeſus is the Chriſt,</hi> and Sonne of God. We finding theſe glorious effects upon our ſouls, cannot but acknowledge that Doctrine; but becauſe theſe are not enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeing that ſanctified and juſtified perſons may be under great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, therefore he addeth the <hi>Spirit</hi> alſo. It is true, the ſame <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>witneſſe in heaven,</hi> but that was becauſe of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and viſible Teſtimony that it gave to Chriſt; but here it ſpeaketh of the witneſſe it giveth on earth; and that muſt be the <hi>ſealing</hi> ſpoken off in other places; for he ſaith, <hi>verſe 6. It is the ſpirit that beareth witneſſe,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſpirit is truth,</hi> having there alſo mentioned <hi>water and bloud: Verſe</hi> 10. he ſeith, <hi>He that beleeveth on the Sonne of God, hath the witneſſe in himſelf.</hi> Thus you ſee that as God hath abundantly provided for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of his people by his ſpirit, to quicken them up therein; ſo alſo for the aſſurance and conſolation of his children, to eſtabliſh them therein. Oh how greatly are we indebted unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who giveth us his Spirit not only to leade us into the truth, and mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, but alſo to fill us with comfort, and to aſſure us that we are the children of God: So that it is the duty of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, not only to improve the former truth, but this alſo; and to preſſe you upon the <hi>ſealing</hi> work of Gods Spirit, as well as the ſanctifying: Hath not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God this Name given it, to be called the <hi>Comforter, John</hi> 14. and ſhall we divide the operations of Gods Spirit, minding him as he is an holy ſpirit, but not a comforting Spirit?</p>
               <p>Having thus informed you what the Scripture declareth in this matter; I <note place="margin">The deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the ſealing of Gods ſpirit.</note> ſhall give you a large and popular deſcription of the nature of this <hi>ſealing,</hi> and the opening of the ſeveral parts touched therein, will much conduce to the knowledge thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="632" facs="tcp:48709:329"/>
The <hi>ſealing of Gods Spirit</hi> may be deſcribed after this manner: <hi>It is a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods ſpirit.</note> 
                  <hi>ſupernaturall and gracious work of Gods Spirit upon the hearts of ſanctified perſons, in a ſecret and unſpeakable manner; whereby they are confirmed and eſtabliſhed in the Covenant of grace, as belonging to them in particular; by ſuch means which God hath appointed thereunto, that through the ſence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they may daily walk more and more boldly, joyfully, and thankefully, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all diſcouragements to the contrary, till they be made compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have made this deſcription the larger, becauſe I would take in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conſiderable about it, as much as may be.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, I give two <hi>Qualifications</hi> or <hi>Adjuncts</hi> to this work of Gods <note place="margin">1. It is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and gracious work</note> Spirit: It is <hi>ſupernatural</hi> and <hi>gracious. Supernatural;</hi> and that if we reſpect either rectified nature or corrupted nature: Rectified nature, for <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of integrity, though he was made perfectly holy, yet he had not this Goſpel-ſealing; no more then he was in Chriſt, as a Mediatour: for had he been thus ſealed, he would certainly have perſevered; and although <hi>Adam</hi> was partaker of the holy Ghoſt, yet it was as he is the third perſon, not as the ſpirit of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> purchaſed by his death for thoſe that are his, ſo that in this reſpect we may ſay, this <hi>ſealing</hi> is a priviledge above the nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> while conſidered before his apoſtacy: but then I call it <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall,</hi> chiefly in reſpect of corrupted nature; for as man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of himſelf hath no power to that which is gracious, ſo neither to that which is comfortable and joyfull. All the world, all Miniſters and Angels, cannot powr one drop of this aſſurance and joy into thy ſoul, unleſſe the Spirit of God inable thee thereunto. As it is <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> ſo it is <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> for this floweth from the former: There is nothing in thee to deſerve this eſtabliſhing; as Gods grace ſanctifying found thee dead in thy ſinnes, ſo his ſealing and comforting findeth thee in a guilty deſpairing way: and therefore as God might leave every prophane man to wallow in his luſts, and ſo let him periſh; thus alſo might he forſake every guilty conſcience under the burthen of thy ſinnes, and ſuffer thee to be a <hi>Cain,</hi> to be a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> even to fall from an hell here into an hell hereafter: So that not only by grace we are ſanctified, but by grace we are healed.

Of Gods ſpirit.</note> efficient cauſe, <hi>The work of Gods Spirit:</hi> It is true, in the Text it is ſaid, That <hi>God doth ſeal us;</hi> and ſo whatſoever works there are, <hi>ad extra,</hi> from God to the creature, they are all common to the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: yet there is a peculiar order and appropriation which the Scripture taketh notice of; So that it is made the work of the <hi>Father</hi> to ſend his Sonne into the world: It is made the work of the Sonne, to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice for our ſinnes; And it is made the proper work of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> to apply the benefits of Chriſts death to our ſouls; therefore ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is attributed to the Spirit, ſo alſo conſolation and ſealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Thus the Texts we mentioned formerly give all this work to the Spirit of God, as in an appropriated manner, doing this for us: It is not then of our ſelves, or of our own power; that we can obtain this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, but it is wrought alone by Gods Spirit: As we have no free-will to the grace of God, ſo neither to the comforts. God as he is called a God of all grace, ſo a God of all conſolation: and <hi>Gal. 5. Joy is the fruit of Gods Spirit,</hi> as well as Faith, Love, and Repentance are in other

places attributed to God. But you will ſay, It may eaſily be granted, that a man being dead in ſinne, he needeth the mighty work of Gods Spirit to raiſe him up, and to give ſpiritual life; but doth it follow, that he needeth the ſame ſpirit to eſtabliſh and aſſure him of Gods love? Yes, no doubt but that the ſame Spirit of God, which bringeth thee out of the gulf of thy luſts, muſt alſo out of the gulf of thy doubts and fears. It's as impoſſible for thee to have comfort of thy ſelf, as grace of thy ſelf; And therefore you ſee the Scripture ſpeaking of this twofold operation of Gods Spirit, as being neceſſary to antidote againſt our twofold corruption: and the grounds of this neceſſity of Gods Spirit are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The heart of a man is naturally oppoſite to any thing that is ſpirituall:</hi>

                  </note> Whatſoever is of God, though never ſo deſirable in it ſelf, yet meeting with our corrupt natures, it findeth oppoſition; therefore we cannot of our ſelves any more receive the promiſes, though infinitely needing of them, then we can obey the commands: We cannot endure honey any more then gall; The way of Goſpel-joy is contrary to a troubled heart, as well as Goſpel-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a ſecure carnal heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We need the Spirit of God to this <hi>ſealing, becauſe that which doth oppoſe this, is indeed nothing but the fruit of ſinne</hi> running down another channel: He that once lived in divers pleaſures, did continually grieve the holy Spirit of God; Let this man finde the guilt of ſinne; Let the Law wound and ſting him, then he grieveth the comforting ſpirit of God by fears and doubts: No wonder then, if it muſt be Gods Spirit only that <hi>ſealeth,</hi> becauſe that alone can remove the guilt within thee, that only can take off theſe objections, theſe diſcouragements that are upon the ſoul: As God raiſed an Eaſt-winde that ſuddenly delivered <hi>Pharaoh</hi> from thoſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> that moleſted him: (this was miraculous, none could do it but God) ſo it is the Spirit of God that alone can take off the heavy burthen of ſinne upon thee: It is Gods Spirit alone that can overrule thy conſcience, that can pacifie it, that can comfort it: It is the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> that maketh us <hi>cry, Abba, Father;</hi> but more of this may come in afterwards.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Of <hi>Inheſion;</hi> ſo it is ſaid to be the <hi>work of Gods Spirit upon the hearts of the godly.</hi> For after this manner the Scripture ſpeaketh, <hi>He hath ſent his Spirit into our hearts,</hi> Gal. 4. 6. And in this Text, <hi>He hath given the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> By this expreſſion is denoted that deep, radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and full poſſeſſion, which the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath upon the <hi>hearts</hi> of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. So that hereby is excluded that vaniſhing and ſuperficial perſwaſion, which may be in a temporary believer, of his intereſt in Chriſt. As a temporary believer hath ſomething like true faith, like true joy, and like true grace upon the ſoul: ſo he hath alſo ſomething like this <hi>ſealing,</hi> and like this aſſured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion upon his heart. Therefore as the former is much diſputed, and it doth greatly exerciſe tender hearts, <hi>viz.</hi> How they may know when they are carried on in the work of ſanctification, beyond thoſe inchoate and imperfect work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which an hypocrite may have: So this latter alſo doth cauſe great ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and care of ſpirit in many gracious ſouls. How ſhall they know their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not a deluſion, is not a falſe perſwaſion ariſing out of an inordinate love to their own ſelves? For the Devil doth not only transform himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, as light is taken for holineſſe; but alſo as it is taken for comfort. Now amongſt other characteriſtical differences, this is one, the perſwaſion of a godly man is more full, plenary and powerfull. Even as ſanctifying grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth efficaciouſly into the <hi>heart,</hi> ſo alſo doth this <hi>ſealing grace;</hi> whereas what hypocrites feel is in a confuſed general and flaſhy way; neither is it drawn out upon permanent and enduring motives. Although doctrinal characters gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the moſt able Miniſters of the Goſpel, are not enough to make us find out this difference in our ſelves, without a rectified conſtitution of the powers of the ſoul within, unleſſe we attain to that qualification ſpoken of by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. who by reaſon of <hi>uſe</hi> or <hi>habit,</hi> or <hi>perfection,</hi> as the word may be rendred, <hi>have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcerne between good and evil.</hi> This Text is much to be preſſed upon you. For it is not every godly man at firſt that can ſeparate the precious from the vile in his ſoul; but there muſt be an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual uſe of the ſenſes this way. Where mark alſo the Apoſtle attributeth to the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in a metaphorical manner: That as the taſte, when well conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is able to diſcern between bitter and ſweet; the eye between white and black, the ear between what is melodious, and what is harſh and diſpleaſing: Thus the ſoul of a godly man, being uſed to heavenly and ſpiritual things, can know what is of God, and what is of Satan, or of nature in him. For you muſt know, there may be four principles of operations in us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Nature,</hi> and that when poliſhed with education, and moral principles, may appear very glorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Satan,</hi> inſinuating himſelf as a ſubtil Serpent, as an Angel of light, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the works of God, though he cannot efficaciouſly work the heart to any thing; all that he doth is by ſuggeſtion, and moving the imaginative and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of a man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and that worketh in us either in a common way by gifts and aſſiſtance, or by a ſanctifying way. Now is there not required much ſpiritual skill and experience to diſcern which is which of all theſe? So that it is no wonder, if he require theſe ſenſes to be exerciſed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a word from thoſe who did <hi>exerciſe themſelves</hi> in the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> games, and that naked, thereby to fit and prepare themſelves to be more agile, and expedite for that ſervice. In this diſpute therefore, enquire not onely for doctrinal ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, and ſignes of this <hi>ſealing of Gods Spirit,</hi> but heartily pray for theſe <hi>exerciſed ſenſes</hi> in ſpiritual things. The other ſubject is, the ſubject of predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of whom it is affirmed, that they have this <hi>ſealing of Gods Spirit,</hi> and that is <hi>ſanctified perſons.</hi> We ſpeak of <hi>adult perſons;</hi> for it is plain, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, though they may be ſanctified, yet becauſe not having actual faith, they neither have this <hi>ſealing.</hi> And if you ask, Have all the <hi>ſanctified perſons</hi> of God <hi>this ſealing?</hi> Have none the <hi>ſanctification of the Spirit,</hi> but they muſt alſo have the <hi>witneſſing of the Spirit?</hi> I anſwer this Queſtion, becauſe of great practical importance, ſhall (God aſſiſting) be handled by it ſelf, after the deſcription hath been explained. That which I ſhall here take notice of, is, That <hi>ſanctification</hi> is neceſſarily preſuppoſed to <hi>this ſealing.</hi> A great Prince will not ſet his ſeal to dung, to make an impreſſion there; neither will God to an heart unſanctified. For as in matter of Doctrine, God will not vouchſafe miracles to confirm that which is a lie; neither in practicals will the Spirit of God witneſſe to that heart, which is not made holy. For indeed it ſhould wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe a lie in ſuch a caſe, informing ſuch they are the ſonnes of God, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are the children of the Devil. This order of Gods Spirits firſt <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi> and then <hi>ſealing</hi> is clear, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 13. In whom after ye believed ye were ſealed.</hi> Thoſe eminent Divines, who defined faith to be aſſurance, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it the ſame with the <hi>ſealing of Gods ſpirit,</hi> are gravelled at this Text, and therefore make this Objection, If faith be aſſurance, be the ſealing, how doth the Text ſay, <hi>After we believed, we were ſealed.</hi> To this therefore <hi>Piſcator</hi> anſwereth, not yeelding that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhould be rendred, <hi>Having beleeved,</hi> as of a thing paſt, but <hi>beleeving,</hi> as in the preſent: but there is too much forcing in this interpretation. Others, they conſider of <hi>faith,</hi> as it hath two parts, <hi>Illumination of minde,</hi> and <hi>fiducial aſſurance.</hi> Now (ſay they) the Apoſtle meaneth by faith, the former work of faith; and ſo the meaning is, After you were enlightned to know the truth, you were confirmed and aſſured: but that opinion making faith juſtifying to be an aſſurance, that Chriſt is mine, is juſtly refuſed. It is plain then, that when the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath in order of nature (for in time they may be both together) ſanctified a man throughout, whereby he is made a <hi>new creature,</hi> then the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this glorious ſtamp upon him, then he giveth him this <hi>ſeal,</hi> as an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable priviledge, whereby he may know himſelf to be the Lords. Even as in antiquity, none might have <hi>ſeals,</hi> but perſons of honour and dignity. So that
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:48709:331"/>
the natural and unregenerate perſon is to ſtand aloof off; thou haſt nothing to do in this priviledge; thou art not the man, whom the great King of Heaven and earth, doth purpoſe thus to honour.</p>
               <p>We proceed in the Deſcription, and there we meet with the <hi>formal Nature</hi> of it, wherein it doth eſſentially conſiſt with the object thereof. The Nature of <note place="margin">4. It confirms and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart.</note> it is, <hi>In confirming and eſtabliſhing the heart of a man.</hi> For this is the chief and uſual end of ſeals, to ratifie a thing, and to make it no longer uncertain and doubtfull: And to this property doth the Scripture chiefly attend. For whereas the ſoul, though ſanctified; is apt to be in daily fears and doubts, about Gods favour and grace towards it; it fluctuateth up and down, having no ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency; the Spirit of God cometh and conſolidateth the ſoul, inabling it to reſt ſatisfied in this, that God is his God, that his ſinnes are pardoned, that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a reconciled Father in Chriſt. And if you ſay, Why do we not need the Spirit of God to do this? Cannot we by our graces, by our repentance and holy life, ſufficiently eſtabliſh our own ſouls in peace? No, by no means; we need the Spirit of God to comfort, as you heard, as well as to ſanctifie; and that for theſe Reaſons,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It is very hard for a man, whoſe guilty conſcience doth preſſe him</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reaſons why we cannot confirm our ſelves. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and condemn him daily, telling him, that he hath deſerved at Gods hands to be eternally tormented in hell; not to thinke, becauſe God may doe thus, that therefore he will do ſo.</hi> In ſuch terrours and affrights we look more to what we have deſerved, we look more to what God may do, then what he will: we are naturally ſuſpicious, and think the worſt of God, even as we doe to man. If we have offended a man greatly, and it lieth in his power to undo us, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quiet, we cannot but think, when ever the opportunity is, he will be avenged, and therefore we dare not truſt him. Yea though we have given no juſt cauſe, if others have taken up an unkind ſpirit towards us, we expect nothing elſe from them, but our ruine, when it is in their power. Therefore for all <hi>Saul's</hi> tears and good works to <hi>David,</hi> yet he would never truſt him. Now although there be no cauſe for us to have ſuch ſuſpicious thoughts about God; for he hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly promiſed that he will receive us: inſomuch as not to believe him herein, is to give more credit to a man, whoſe words many times ſatisfie us, than to God, who is truth it ſelf: yet the heart being guilty and full of fears doth work in this doubtfull manner about God. How hard is it to bring the afflicted ſinner to good perſwaſions about God, and that though by promiſes, and other wayes God hath ſo abundantly provided againſt ſuch diſtruſt? Here then is the reaſon, why we need the <hi>ſealing of Gods Spirit,</hi> we cannot perſwade our ſelves but God will doe what he may do, and what we have deſerved. And</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon followeth upon the former, <hi>We can hardly be perſwaded, that the great and good things which we ſtand in need of, God will ever beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>us, who are ſo unworthy of them.</hi> Can a beggars daughter be perſwaded, that a great King will marry her? But here is a farre greater diſproportion. What will the great God of Heaven, ſo holy, ſo full of majeſty, look graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon me, and not only forgive me my ſinnes, but advance me to eternal glory? Theſe things are very improbable. Shall <hi>Joſeph</hi> be freed not only from the priſon, but promoted to the greateſt honour in the Land, next to the King? Who would have believed it? And thus it is here; the ſoul having low and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of it ſelf, cannot be perſwaded, that the great God of Heaven will look upon ſuch deſpicable wretches as they are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The way of evangelical confidence, with the comfortable effects thereof, are wholly ſupernatural.</hi> And therefore no wonder, if we need the Spirit of God <note place="margin">3.</note> to help us therein. Not only holineſſe and grace is <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> but aſſurance and joy are likewiſe <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> As we cannot pray without the Spirit help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our infirmities; ſo neither are we able to call God <hi>Father.</hi> If faith in Chriſt,
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:48709:331"/>
by which we are juſtified be <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> then alſo is the comfort and peace flowing from the knowledge thereof. As the Doctrine of the Goſpel is by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, fleſh and blood hath not revealed this unto us, that Chriſt is the Sonne of God: ſo neither can fleſh and blood enable us to the perſwaſion of this Mediator, as loving me, and giving himſelf for me. Certainly, if it be the gift of God, to have a dogmatical faith, to be kept from hereſie: it's no leſſe to have this fiducial application with the ſenſe thereof upon our ſouls. Wonder not then, if we make it the Spirits worke to have this aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We need the Spirit to confirm us, becauſe the fleſh within us, is full of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                  <hi>and bringeth many plauſible arguments againſt it.</hi> Inſomuch that what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and other ſubtil Papiſts bring as <hi>Engines</hi> to demoliſh this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, are very ſutable to the corrupt heart. For they think, the heart is very deceitfull, there is much hypocriſie; I may think I do that for God, which I do for vain-glory; that I am humbled for ſinne, when worldly motives only afflict me. Again, fleſh doth doth ſuggeſt, there may be much unknown evil in thee, thy heart may be worſe than thou takeſt it to be. Though the Sea ſeeme calme ſometimes, yet there are dangerous Rocks under the water: and thus though outwardly there may appear much tenderneſſe, yet there may be a rock in the bottome. Furthermore, the fleſh may ſuggeſt, Wilt thou be perſwaded of Gods favour to thee in particular? Is not this to enter into Gods ſecrets? Is not this to climb up into Heaven in an arrogant manner? Yea, is not this the way to nouriſh ſecurity in thee, and make thee preſume of Gods favour, though thy iniquities be never ſo many and groſſe? Laſtly, The <hi>fleſh</hi> telleth thee of former ſins, thou didſt once wallow in, as alſo the preſent failings, that thy own ſoul doth frequently condemn thee for. Now are not theſe very plauſible? Do they not importune to diffidence? And certainly theſe would overwhelme thee, did not the Spirit of God overcome all, and ſupport thee againſt them. Yea</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>We need the Spirit of God to ſeal us, becauſe the Devil is very buſie</hi>

                  <note place="margin">3. Particular.</note> 
                  <hi>God doth enable us to receive Chriſt as our Chriſt, to apply the promiſes as belonging to us in particular.</hi> To ſay with <hi>Thomas, My Lord, my God:</hi> And with <hi>Paul,</hi> Galat. 2. <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> Such a particular faith is not onely poſſible, but a duty, of which much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and profitable Diſcourſe might be made; but I forbear, becauſe I am to treat of it (God aſſiſting) upon another account. Therefore for the
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:48709:332" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preſent, you are to know, that this worke of Gods Spirit in <hi>confirming</hi> and <hi>ſealing of us,</hi> is eſpecially manifeſted in this particular, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting way of the promiſes of grace, as our portion. Therefore it is ſaid to cauſe us <hi>to call God Father;</hi> which implieth, our peculiar intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in him. Doe not then be diſcouraged from this <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Anakims</hi> that are in the way. Fear not to call God thy Father, though thou findeſt many diſcouragements within thee. The Devil would not have thee taſte of this honey.</p>
               <p>But I proceed; and the next particular in the Deſcription, is the <hi>Manner,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">How the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſeals, even by the means that God hath appointed.</note> how the Spirit of God cometh thus to witneſſe unto us, how we come to be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that is ſaid to be,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>By the meanes God hath appointed thereunto.</hi> This is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for hereby this gracious worke of God is differenced from all Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical deluſions; or from thoſe prophetical extaſies, which the Prophets of God ſometimes did partake off from that rapture <hi>Paul</hi> was in, when he ſaid, <hi>Whether he was in the body, or out of the body, he did not know.</hi> No, we are not to expect ſuch immediate operations of the Spirit upon us, where the Spirit ſhall be both the efficient cauſe, and the object al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Neither may we hearken after ſome voice of Gods Spirit, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate teſtimony within, ſaying to us, as ſometimes a voice ſpake to Chriſt, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne.</hi> We may not expect, that Chriſt ſhould ſay to thee after ſome viſible manner, as he did to <hi>Mary Magdalen, Be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> We are not to hearken to ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that may preſſe for ſuch a witneſſing; but we muſt give care to what the Spirit of God ſpeaketh in the Scripture, and ſo expect to have this confirmation and ſealing, <hi>by thoſe meanes which he hath appointed.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it is in the Doctrine of the Scripture; it is the Spirit of God that doth fully aſſure the hearts of believers, that it is Gods word. But how doth it thus perſwade the ſoul? Not by any immediate teſtimony, but by theſe implanted arguments therein, as the holineſſe of the matter, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the ſtyle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which this undoubted perſwaſion is wrought in us. Thus it is in this worke of ſealing; the Spirit of God, though it be the efficient cauſe of it, yet it is in ſuch an order and way, as he <hi>hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi> For we muſt not thinke, that it is ſuitable to the workings of Gods Spirit, that we ſhould have a blinde perſwaſion in us, whereby we are aſſured; onely we know not why, and we are not able to give any reaſon, that we are aſſured, but becauſe we are aſſured. The Spirit of God attempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth its operations to our rational nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But what are thoſe meanes and wayes whereby the holy Spirit doth thus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Which means are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, as 1. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
                  <hi>aſſure us?</hi> They are either <hi>External,</hi> or <hi>Internal. External</hi> are two-fold:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>By the Sacraments</hi> in the right uſe of them, the Spirit of God doth aſſure us. Hence you heard, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are called <hi>ſeales;</hi> neither may we thinke that Chriſt hath appointed theſe Ordinances in a barren, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and empty manner. No, God will accompany his owne Ordinance to the right receiver; and therefore as truly, as he received the bread and wine, ſo truly is he alſo made partaker of Chriſts body and blood. Whereas then the promiſes are indefinitely propounded, the Sacraments they are particular applied, and by theſe the Spirit of God doth aſſure us of our intereſt in the promiſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another <hi>External way,</hi> is, <hi>By thoſe notes and markes which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. By the marks of ſuch to whom the promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</note> 
                  <hi>are given of ſuch, to whom the promiſes doe belong.</hi> The Scripture doth not onely declare the promiſes, but characterizeth the perſons to whom they doe infallibly belong. Inſomuch that he who findeth, he doth true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:48709:333"/>
beleeve and repent. He that findeth he is made a new creature, ſuch an one may as undoubtedly conclude, being enabled thereunto by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, that the promiſes doe in particular belong to him, as if he were named, as if it were ſaid, <hi>Thou Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Thou John, thou art received into the favour of God.</hi> So that this particular doth evacuate all thoſe boaſts and confidences which many may have of Gods love towards them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the marks and ſigns are not applicable unto them, which the promiſes do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. But theſe I call <hi>External.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are <hi>Internal Qualifications,</hi> by which the Spirit of God doth thus perſwade and aſſure us, not that they are a cauſe, or that we are <note place="margin">Or elſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> to put confidence in them, but by them as ſignes and effects of Gods gracious love, we come to be aſſured of the love it ſelfe: As by the Rain-bow, we come to be aſſured, that God will not drowne the world again.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enlarge upon theſe, having had opportunity from ſome paſſages in this Chapter to ſpeak thereunto.</p>
               <p>The firſt particular ſigne or marke by which the Spirit of God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or ſeale unto, that I ſhall inſtance in, is, <hi>The ſanctified and ſavoury</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The ſignes whereby we may know the ſpirit witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. 1. The ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> 
                  <hi>improvement of afflictions.</hi> Such as are chaſtened from the Lord, and taught by him, theſe may unqueſtionably conclude Gods ſpecial love towards them. <hi>Hebr. 12. Revel.</hi> 3. The Scripture doth in thoſe places abundantly evidence, that whoſoever is a ſonne of God, is afflicted by him: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he who hath no chaſtiſements, is to thinke that he is a baſtard, and not a ſonne. Now this is not to be underſtood of afflictions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves meerly as ſo, but as ſanctified, as working to our ſpirituall good. And when they have this bleſſed fruit, it is as comfortable an argument, to be aſſured of Gods grace towards us, as any may be thought on. The Apoſtle maketh this a ſure effect of Predeſtination, <hi>Romans 8. 26. He did alſo predeſtinate us to be conformed to the image of his Sonne,</hi> which is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>ſuffering,</hi> as he did, that ſo we might be glorified, as he was. Look then with a more comfortable face upon afflictions, than thou haſt done. Doe not flie from them with fear, as <hi>Moſes</hi> from his Rod, when turned into a Serpent. For when theſe doe worke to thy ſpiritual good; when they are like fire to make the gold leſſe droſſie; when they are like winnowing, to purge the wheat from its chaffe; then know, this is an aſſured teſtimony of Gods favour. Thou needeſt not ſay, Who will goe up into Heaven? What meſſenger will come immediately from God to perſwade my ſoule of Gods favour towards me? For the teſtimony is on earth, it is neare thee, doe not caſt thy eyes from it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond ſigne or meanes, by which we come to this ſealing, is, <hi>The obſervation and experience of Gods gracious preſence in us, and with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with us.</note> 
                  <hi>us, whereby we are preſerved from ſome, and kept either from, or in ſuch temptations, that might have undone us.</hi> When we finde that grace accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying of us, which <hi>David</hi> prayed for, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19. to keep us back from ſinning. As the childe of God hath the Angels of Heaven, to take care of him; they have it in charge, to hold him (as it were) in their armes, as a Nurſe doth her little childe: ſo is he alſo inwardly fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inherent grace, to keepe him in his wayes to Heaven, he hath ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual grace, and actual grace, and he hath preventing grace, and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, he hath exciting and perſevering grace. Now that man who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth how richly and mercifully the grace of God putteth it ſelfe forth in theſe ſeveral effects; how often, when he is ready to goe aſtray, the grace of God ſeeketh him out; how often grace prevented and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:48709:333"/>
him, elſe he had beene ſwallowed up in ſuch deepe gulphs of ſinne; he (I ſay) that findeth ſuch prevenitng, concomitant, and ſubſequent grace of God; he that findeth this Rock Chriſt to follow him with gracious effects (as ſome ſay) the waters out of the Rock followed the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe to refreſh them; this man may ſay, verily God is here, verily God is with me. <note place="margin">3. The antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent works of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Spirit of God doth give us <hi>Conſolation, by the antecedent workes of ſanctification,</hi> Rom. 8. 9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> But the godly they have received the Spirit of God. And if the ſoul, which is the ſpirit of a man, manifeſt it ſelf preſent in the body by its operations; ſhall we not much rather thinke, that the Spirit of Chriſt, where it dwelleth in a man, will make knowne it ſelfe? Shall we have theſe coales of fire in our boſome, and not perceive them?</p>
               <p>Now there is an order in the works of Gods Spirit, which we alſo muſt attend unto, and not think to have one before the other. The order is this, the Spirit of God doth</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Enlighten the minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It doth ſanctifie the will and affections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It doth witneſſe and ſeale to us theſe bleſſed effects.</hi> To looke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for conſolation before ſanctification, is prepoſterous. Oh how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is it, when the childe of God earneſtly ſeeketh after all theſe effects upon his ſoule, and that in the order God hath appointed! Theſe few qualifications may ſuffice; by theſe and the like the Spirit of God doth confirme. Onely you muſt know, theſe doe but objectively offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if the Spirit of God doth not rightly conſtitute our inward man, and enable us, all theſe bleſſed effects may be upon our ſoules, and yet we be diſconſolate, as if we had them not. Even as there may be pleaſant flowers in a garden, yet if we have not light, we cannot ſee them. So that the cauſe of aſſurance is more from the Spirit of God efficiently eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the heart, than from theſe qualifications, which doe objectively onely declare themſelves: Even as in faith dogmatically aſſenting to divine truths, the work of Gods Spirit is more upon the underſtanding, giving firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſtedfaſt adheſion, than upon the motives of credibility in the truths themſelves. But what is neceſſary to a fuller clearing of this, will upon another occaſion be conſidered. <note place="margin">Of the end of the ſpirits ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even that we might live godly and thankfully.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I proceed to the laſt thing in this Deſcription, and that is, the <hi>final cauſe,</hi> which is, <hi>That under the ſenſe of this we might live boldly,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this ſenſe.</hi> For this ſealing of Gods Spirit, doth make ſuch a divine impreſſion upon the ſoule, that we feele it, and perceive it not indeed bodily, as we doe the fire that burneth, but rationally and ſpiritually in our inward man. So that not onely grace is from Gods Spirit; but the experimental feeling of it, is likewiſe from the ſame. Hence it is not to be called an humane, but divine ſenſe. For a gracious conſtitution is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to feele what is grace, and to diſcerne the effects thereof. But I haſten.</p>
               <p>This ſenſe and apprehenſion of Gods ſealing being thus experimentally in us, we find a three-fold advantage thereby.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We walke boldly, confidently: Inſomuch that we can cry <hi>Father, Epheſ. 3. 12. We have boldneſſe and acceſſe with confidence.</hi> There is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>We are able to ſpeake any thing in the preſence of God;</hi> whereas in fears and doubts our prayers are interrupted, we queſtion whether we may ſay this or that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="642" facs="tcp:48709:334"/>
Secondly, <hi>Hereby we walke comfortably:</hi> Yea, it is called, <hi>Joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. and <hi>Rom. 14. 17. Peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Kingdome of God is there ſaid to conſiſt in this. Alas, how contrary doe the people of God walke to this Text, for want of ſealing, as if godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lay in doubts, in fears, and dejections of ſpirit? Surely the people of God are to bewail their ignorance and low principles in theſe things. Thou makeſt thy ſelf to be like an heir under age, as the Apoſtle alludeth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. and ſo not differing from a ſervant; whereas the Goſpel-light and Evangelical principles ſet home by the Spirit of adoption, ſhould fill thee with liberty and exceeding great joy.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Hereby we alſo live thankefully, never ſatisfying our ſelves with admiring, and commending the unspeakable and unſearchable riches of Gods grace.</hi> Two great gulphs the Spirit of God hath delivered thee out of; the ſinfull luſts and corruptions thou didſt once wallow in; and the ſlaviſh, ſad, tormenting feares thou waſt once almoſt overwhelmed with. Oh what cauſe is here of <hi>thankefullneſſe!</hi> How ſorry art thou that thou art no more enlarged? That thou haſt but one heart, and one tongue to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in this matter? And the aggravation of all this is, that we may be thus bold, joyfull and thankfull, notwithſtanding all diſcouragements to the contrary; for they are many and dreadfull. How many failings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? How many temptations without? What fiery darts from Satan? And yet a ſealed Chriſtian is able to looke upon theſe with as much joy, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did upon the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> carcaſſes, that lay dead upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore. But if God ſhould let open theſe flood-gates upon the moſt ſanctified perſon, he would be immediately ſwallowed up with them, as <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> were ſuddenly in the earth. And then</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You have the terme till which this <hi>ſealing</hi> ſhall laſt, and that is, <hi>Till we are made happy compleatly in Heaven.</hi> So <hi>Epheſ. 4. 30. We are ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the day of redemption.</hi> This way of faith and aſſurance will then ceaſe, it will be turned into the immediate viſion and fruition of God: Then there will be no feares, no doubts, any more than luſts and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions. How mercifull then is God, that giveth us ſuch manna in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which will ceaſe when we come into <hi>Canaan?</hi>

To this purpoſe <hi>Calvin</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeak on this very Text, which <hi>Stapleten</hi> looketh upon as depraving the meaning of the Apoſtle. <hi>Whoſoever</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin, hath not the ſpirit of God a witneſſe within him, ſo that he can ſay Amen to God calling him to the certain hope of ſalvation; he doth</hi> falſo Chriſtianum nomen obtendere, <hi>pretend only to a Chriſtian name; not being ſo indeed.</hi> To the ſame ſenſe alſo in his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>lib. 3. cap. 2. par. 16.

Then on the other ſide, if you do conſult with the experiences of theſe whom we have cauſe to judge truly godly, we ſhall meet with few that ſay they have this ſealing. They have good hopes (they will tell you) in the favour of God, and ſometimes they finde ſuch ſupports of ſoul, that they walk with much peace and comfort; but to ſay that they have ordinarily this <hi>ſealing</hi> of Gods Spirit, that they dare not, what then ſhall be anſwered to the Objection? I ſhall not in this place enlarge on it, only I ſhall ſpeak ſome things to ſatisfie the doubting ſoul in this Point.</p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>You are to know, That this priviledge of ſealing is ſpoken of in the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. It belongs to all the godly.</note> 
                  <hi>Scripture as belonging to all the godly.</hi> There is none excluded: It is the duty of every one to endeavour after it, to make all diligence in prayer, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means to obtain it. We are not to conceive, as Papiſts do, that ſome may have it by a ſpeciall revelation, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and other eminent Saints, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we grant, that whoſoever hath this <hi>ſealing,</hi> hath it by a ſpeciall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but not in the Popiſh ſenſe. that is, the Spirit of God doth in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner evidence unto a beleever, by the fruits of faith, that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto Chriſt. This <hi>ſealing</hi> then the Scripture ſpeaketh of as a mercy vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:48709:335"/>
to every ſanctified perſon, at leaſt, that he may be made partaker of it: for not only the Texts fore-mentioned, but that alſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this truth; <hi>Becauſe yeare Sons. he hath ſent the Spirit of Adoption into your hearts: Becauſe you are Sonnes,</hi> now <hi>a quatenus ad omne valet conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia,</hi> is a known Rule: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh generally, <hi>The Spirit witneſſeth with our ſpirits, that we are the Sonnes of God.</hi> You are not then to think that this admirable favour is deſtined only for ſome choice ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God: No, this ſcep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er is held out to every beleever, ſuch honourall his Saints may have.</p>
               <p>But yet in the ſecond place, <hi>It is no wonder, if the primitive Chriſtians, who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Primitive Chriſtians did more partake of it then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do uow.</note> 
                  <hi>lived in the Apoſtelical daies, did partake of it more powerfully and plentifully then beleevers generally do in this latter age.</hi> The Apoſtle in his Epiſtles might ſpeak of this <hi>ſealing</hi> as partaked of by all, becauſe then beleevers had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure, not only of extraordinary gifts (many of them I mean) but alſo of the ſanctifying graces of Gods ſpirit; They lived up to higher degrees of fervency, of zeal, of heavenly-mindedneſſe, then ordinari y we do. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, their converſion was more eminent and remarkable, and that by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Miniſtry, which was accompanied by ſignes and wonderful miracles; ſo that as their dogmaticall faith had greater means to heighten it then ours, ſo likewiſe their ſalvifical and ſpeciall faith. They were wonderfully coverted from <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> both from idolatry and prophaneneſſe, whereby their change was the greater, and ſo were more ſenſible of Gods Spirit working upon them. Laſtly, They were expoſed to great perſecutions, they lived under conſtant tribulations, there were no outward encouragements for them. Now it's Gods way to vouchſafe this inward comfort and peace moſt to thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of all outward. Thus the Martyrs even in theſe latter daies, did in a great meaſure enjoy this <hi>Sealing</hi> of Gods Spirit; elſe they could not have been carried through thoſe bitter trials with ſuch unſpeakable joy and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latton, as they were. Theſe things conſidered, no wonder if the primitive Chriſtians might have an higher meaſure of this ſealing then we have; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it muſt be confeſſed, that even in thoſe daies there were many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and ſeveral temporary beleevers, who had only vaniſhing apprehenſions in theſe great things, not ſolid perſwaſions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Although this ſealing be propounded in the Scripture as common to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It is not ſo neceſſary to happineſſe as ſanctification.</note> 
                  <hi>all,</hi> yet it is <hi>not of the ſame abſolute connexion with eternal happineſſe, as ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is, without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God:</hi> without this <hi>ſealing</hi> a man may; Inſomuch that the promiſes of pardon and glory are not made to this aſſurarce and conſolation, but to grace and holineſſe. It is not ſaid, Thou ſhalt not be ſaved, unleſſe thou have this; for if it were ſo, then many of Gods Children had cauſe to be greatly amazed, but it is not in the ſame way of neceſſity as ſanctification is. Seeing therefore it is more than a temporall mercy, and yet not ſo high as an abſolute ſpirituall mercy to ſalvation; it is to be reckoned in the number of ſuch mercies that are ſpirituall, but yet not of peremptory neceſſity; ſuch are degrees of grace: Theſe are promiſed to the godly; but not as abſolutely neceſſary, for then all beleevers ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually godly: but they are diſtributed according to the wiſedom of God. Thus it is alſo in this matter of ſealing.</p>
               <p>Hence in the fourth place, <hi>Sealing doth not follow ſanctification as a naturall,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Sealing doth not follow ſanctification of neceſſity, but by Gods appointment.</note> 
                  <hi>neceſſary property, but by divine appointment and order.</hi> It is not as when there is fire, there muſt neceſſarily be heat; or as when there is the Sun, there might be light, only God hath appointed ſuch an order. There is a great aptneſſe and fitneſſe, for <hi>ſealing</hi> to follow ſanctifying. Hence it is commonly Gods way, to make one follow the other, but yet this chain may ſometime be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; if God ſometimes hinder naturall agents from their effects, as when the

fire did not burn the bodies of the three Worthies. No wonder, if in meer poſitive and inſtituted waies of God, ſometimes there may be an interruption made, ſo that experience doth unqueſtionably demonſtrate this, that many truly ſanctified ones may yet for a ſeaſon at leaſt want this <hi>ſealing;</hi> yea, go bowed down and afflicted with thoughts clean contrary, as if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſpirit of bondage only: Their love is ſo farre from caſting out tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, <hi>On Gods part, for ſome ſpeciall and peculiar reaſons not known to us alwaies.</hi> The Lord hath wiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It was thus with Chriſt his only begotten Sonne, that he might accompiſh the bitter work of redemption for us, he was left to thoſe ſtrong agonies and fears, the Scrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure ſpeaketh of; he had not conſolation nor joy, when he cried out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou for ſaken me?</hi> his enemies gave him gall to drink, and his ſoul taſted of gall within: his enemies ſet a crown of thorns upon his head, and he had ſharp thorns in his heart, in ſomuch that an Angel was ſent to comfort him. This might make us wonder, that God ſhould not ſpare his own Sonne, but it was neceſſary for our redemption: for as he could not have wrought our reconciliation for us, unleſſe he had a paſſible body that could ſuffer death; ſo neither unleſſe he had a ſuffering ſoul by fears and grief, though all without ſinne. It was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe likewiſe to be without <hi>ſealing,</hi> for he could have no comfort in his heart, while he complained, the Arrows of the Almighty did ſtick faſt in him; while he was terrified with dreams and viſions in the night. Thus the Lord ſtill doth exerciſe his ſoveraignty therein, he withdraweth the light of his favour from many choice ſanctified ones; They wander in a wilderneſſe, their lives are a burthen to them, they cannot meet God in any ordinance, as if they were become like ſo many rejected <hi>Sauls,</hi> when yet the favour of the Lord is exceeding great to them, only they perceive it not.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, <hi>On our part many times, yea, too often when the cauſe is;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. On our part</note> 
                  <hi>that we have not this ſealing.</hi> We may thank our ſelves for bloaching the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſo, that no comfortable thing can be written upon it. I ſhall inſtance in one or two waies, how we come to keep off this ſealing.</p>
               <p>And the firſt is. <hi>by falling into ſome grievous and groſſe ſinnes;</hi> if ſuch do <note place="margin">1. By falling into groſs ſins.</note> drive away the naturall peace of a meer natural conſcience, as is plain in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, how much more the ſupernaturall peace of a tender enlightned conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? <hi>Davids</hi> penitentiall Pſalm 51. doth fully ſpeak to this; he there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of his broken bones, he prayeth to <hi>have joy reſtored to him;</hi> all which argueth, that by ſinne he had loſt all comfortable enjoyment of God; That he was in a chaos and dark confuſion: and truly if there were no hell, no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to threaten the people of God with, to keep them from groſſe ſinnes: This of Gods iron turnace to be caſt into, is enough to make our hearts trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Oh the wofull condition that godly manis in, who in ſtead of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption he once enjoyed, is now delivered up to Satan, to be under his fears, his black temptations; No outward comfort in the world can then give him a drop of caſe. Oh then come not near any groſſe ſinnes, fly from the appearance of it, for this <hi>ſealing</hi> cannot conſiſt with that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Any careleſſe and remiſſe walking,</hi> though we do not fall into <note place="margin">2. Careleſſe walking.</note> groſſe ſins, is enough to put this Sunne into an Eclipſe: Any angry and bitter words to another will do it; Any looſe and wanton diſcourſe may bring thee into this deep dungeon: For ſo you may ſee, <hi>Eph. 4. 30. Grieve not the ſpirit by which yeare ſealed.</hi> But how is that done? for ſo you may ſee the verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:48709:336"/>
                  <hi>by corrupt communications, by unſavoury, graceleſſe words:</hi> and then ſee the ſubſequent Verſe; <hi>Let all bitterneſſe, all wrath and anger be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> Doſt thou then complain thou haſt not this <hi>ſealing?</hi> how can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe? How many frothy, fooliſh ſpeeches haſt thou? How many angry, bitter words come from thee? If you hereby grieve Gods ſpirit, no wonder that he leave thee to thy grief.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>By any inward ſecurity, and ſecret ſelf-confidence,</hi> we may deprive <note place="margin">3. Self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> our ſelves of this <hi>ſealing.</hi> For ſeeing this is a Goſpel-privi edge, a ray from the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, it is only conveighed in an Evangelicall method: Now all Goſpel-diſpenſations are to the broken in heart, to the poor in ſpirit, to the humbled ſinner, renouncing all righteouſneſſe and worth of our own; ſo that as it is in the work of ſanctification, no ſooner hath a man any ſecret confidence in his own power, but ſanctifying grace in ſome meaſure leaveth him: As we ſee in <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Though all men ſhould for ſake Chriſt, yet he would not.</hi> Thus it is alſo in the way of conſolation, no ſooner doth a man begin to be lifted up within, becauſe he hath theſe comfortable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but preſently they are ſubſtrated from us. Thus <hi>David</hi> did but ſay, <hi>his mountain was eſtabliſhed that he ſhould not be moved;</hi> and immediately <hi>God hid his face, and he was troubled,</hi> Pſa. 30. 6, 7. Therefore that man who would enjoy this deſirable priviledge, muſt walk with a tender, humble, and yet an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall, fiducial frame of heart.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When we ſpeak of Gods <hi>ſealing,</hi> you muſt rightly underſtand the <note place="margin">4. This ſealing doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all doubts.</note> meaning of it; <hi>It is not as if thereby ſuch a certainty were wrought in the ſoul, that it doth exclude all fears and doubts.</hi> No, that is a proper priviledge to heaven: as the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit in matter of ſanctification, ſo it doth alſo in conſolation. As therefore when the ſpirit of God ſanctifieth on the ſpirits part, grace is pure and perfect, but on the ſubjects part which doth receive it; ſo it hath much droſſe and imperfection cleaving to it. Thus it is alſo in this <hi>ſealing,</hi> though the teſtimony and witneſſe on the ſpirits part be infaliible and undoubted; yet as we receive it, ſo there is much unbeleef and doubting adhering to us. This <hi>ſealing</hi> therefore, and many fears and doubts may conſiſt together, becauſe it is not abſolutely predominant and prevalent; only here is a conflict; we are to ſtrive againſt theſe doubts, we are to pray againſt theſe fears, till the Lord cauſe light to ariſe out of this darkneſs: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the godly may have this <hi>ſealing,</hi> and yet not attend to it, nor perceive it, becauſe the corruptions of our heart are moſt perceived by us, and we are ſo exerciſed by them, that we do not conſider what the ſpirit of God doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at that time, This then maketh the godly think they have not this <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at all, becauſe they have it not with that dominion, as they deſire to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all conflicts and troubles within; and ſo, as in reſpect of ſanctification there is ſome grace under much corruption, ſo there is alſo this certainty under many fears. And if you ſay, that it is a contradiction, that a man ſhould be aſſured, and doubt alſo. I anſwer, No, no more than that a man ſhould be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and yet have ſome corruption in him, for they do not reſpect the ſame thing; Certainty ariſeth from the Promiſes of God, ſet home by his ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; ahd fears ariſe from the ſence and feeling of our own weakneſſes. So that what the holy Apoſtle ſpeaketh concerning the work of grace in him, with the oppoſitian thereunto, <hi>the good he would do he doth not, and he findes evil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him.</hi> Thus it is here; the ſealing, the aſſurance, the comfort he would have he cannot obtain, but the doubts and ſlaviſh fears which he hateth, they carry him away captive.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Suppoſe a godly man hath not this ſealing, yet let him not limit God to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. They that have it not are to ſubmit to God.</note> 
                  <hi>the times and ſeaſons he would, but leave all to the merciful diſpenſation of a wiſe and righteous God.</hi> Thou haſt not aſſurance, yet no more thou haſt not perfect
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:48709:336"/>
grace yet, thou haſt not perfect holineſſe yet, but thou waiteſt upon the Lord till it be accompliſhed, and ſo do here. Oh but I am afraid I ſhall never have it, I ſhall dye without it! that is more than thou knoweſt: how ſuddenly and graciouſly doth God uſe to rebuke theſe windes and waves, when we little think of it? yet know thy intereſt to heaven is not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: Thou wilt indeed want much comfort, but not thy title to heaven; Thou art as ſure to go to heaven, as if thou wert aſſured of it: And withall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the faith of dependance and recumbency upon Chriſt only, is more noble than aſſurance, in that thou giveſt God moſt glory. In this thy own intereſt is ſatisfied. And laſtly know, that heaven is coming to thee, and thou going to it, when not only ſin, but all fears ſhall be removed away; Thou ſhalt then diſpute thy condition no more, thou ſhalt not then queſtion thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Gods grace to thee, but ſhall put on the Crown of glory, never to be moleſted, and diſquieted any more.</p>

               <p>THis is the third and laſt ſimilitude, by which that gracious confirmation of beleevers in Gods promiſes, is declared; and if we conſider them relatively to the diſcourſe precedent, we ſhall eaſily ſee, what great reaſon there is that the promiſes ſhould not be only <hi>yea and Amen</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but in bs alſo. Seeing we have this ſpecial work of Gods ſpirit, <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſealing, and giving us an earneſt of the things that are promiſed.</hi> Now, as you heard, though the ſame prividedge be meant under this threefold ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, yet every one hath its proper notion; and therefore the earneſt here ſpoken of may differ from <hi>ſealing,</hi> thus: That the <hi>ſealing</hi> of Gods Spirit doth aſſure of us that which is already wrought in us, as <hi>ſeals</hi> confirm contracts that are already made (though hereby alſo is implyed a certain continuance and perſeverance in that ſtate, which is ſealed;) but the <hi>earneſt</hi> ſpoken of in the text, doth principally relate to the future: So that whereas the childe of God might object, what if I be ſealed and aſſured for the preſent of my good condition, yet who knoweth what may fall out thereafter? I may apoſtatize, I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to leave me, and ſo this ſeal be as it were defaced. But though the word <hi>ſealing</hi> doth alſo imply continuance, (for it is till the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) yet the word <hi>(earneſt)</hi> doth more properly ſpeak to that Objection; Thou haſt the earneſt given thee of that inheritance which ſhall be hereafter.</p>
               <p>So that in the words we may take notice of the <hi>mercy</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of it, and the <hi>ſubject</hi> receiving it. The <hi>mercy</hi> it ſelf is ſaid to be an earneſt,

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a <hi>pledge, pignus;</hi> It is ſo called either <hi>à pugno,</hi> (ſay ſome) becauſe the pledge is delivered by the hand, or elſe as <hi>Martinius Lexi. pignus</hi> from <hi>pago</hi> or <hi>pango,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſuch covenants and contracts there is an agreement eſtabliſhed. But <hi>Hierom</hi> of old, and others of late do no waies approve of rendring it a <hi>pledge,</hi> but an <hi>earnest;</hi> for there is this difference in the civil law, between <hi>arra</hi> and <hi>pignus,</hi> an <hi>earneſt</hi> and <hi>a pledge:</hi> an <hi>earneſt</hi> is part of the price that is to be paid down, and ſo goeth to make it up; but a <hi>pledge</hi> is given for ſecurity by the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the creditor, and taken away again when the debt is paid. Now this metaphor doth no waies hold in this caſe, for God is not a debtor to us: when he giveth us his grace, he doth not borrow of us; neither when the promiſe is fullfilled, is this grace taken away; for in heaven grace is not aboliſhed, but perfected. Indeed <hi>Aquinas</hi> upon the place maketh this Obſervation. <hi>That as a pledge muſt be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>equivalently worth to the debt, ſo it is here; grace wrought in us, especially the Spirit of God beſtowed upon us, is equivalent to glory.</hi> But that is falſe, that in our graces wrought by Gods Spirit, there is an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall condignity and equality to everlaſting glory. It's therefore more proper and ſuitable to call it an <hi>earneſt,</hi> which was commonly uſed two waies, either in civill commerce or matrimoniall contracts, called therefore in the latter <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhatio:</hi> The end and uſe of it was to ſecure the full payment of the debt, or fullfilling of any promiſe made; and in this ſenſe it is true in the Text, God knowing our proneneſſe to doubt about his promiſes, as alſo how uncertain and fearfull we are, doth give us his <hi>grace here</hi> as a <hi>ſure earneſt</hi> of our eternal happineſſe. So that by this <hi>earneſt,</hi> we are not to underſtand extraordinary and miraculatous gifts of Gods Spirit; for many had them who yet never could enter into glory, but the ſpecial works of grace ſanctifying. Theſe are fitly called an <hi>earneſt</hi> (though there be alſo ſome diſſimilitudes as is to be ſhewed) inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he who findeth he hath grace here, may certainly conclude he ſhall have glory hereafter; for though there be ſome who hold, that ſome may have true faith, and yet totally fall off, and that only the elected beleever ſhall perſevere, yet that is built upon a ſandy foundation.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, you have the efficient cauſe of this, and that is <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God;</hi> Some indeed make this by way of appoſition: <hi>The earneſt, which is the ſpirit;</hi> as if the ſpirit it ſelf, both in this and the other Text, were the <hi>earneſt,</hi> which may be received, provided, that by the <hi>ſpirit</hi> we mean not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the perſon of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> but the gracious operations thereof; for the people of God partake of both, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. They are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> called ſo, not becauſe it is the <hi>ſpirit promiſed,</hi> for that is too frigid, though it be true; but becauſe it is the ſpirit that doth apply the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the ſoul, and make us aſſured of them, as he is called the <hi>holy ſpirit,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>authour of holineſſe:</hi> But then <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. there we are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed by the ſpirit,</hi> denoting the ſpirit of God to be the efficient cauſe of
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:48709:337"/>
it: So that it is a blaſphemous wreſting of the Scripture by a Socinian; when <hi>by the holy Ghoſt thus ſealing unto us, is</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Smal. diſp. de promiſſo ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſancti.) meant no more than a ſure hope of eternal life: He denieth the holy Ghost to be God, and a Perſon, it is only</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſure hope within us:</hi> but this is to confound this effect with the cauſe: faith, and love, and hope, are the effects of Gods Spirit, they are not the ſpirit it ſelf. So that from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſpirit of God</hi> doth ſeal us, we may gather a ſure argument, that he is truly God, for the ſpirit is ſaid to <hi>confirm us,</hi> and God is ſaid to <hi>confirm</hi> us, whereby it is implyed, that to <hi>confirm</hi> our hearts is a divine operation, as well as to ſanctifie it. It is true, how the ſpirit of God is God, and how it proceedeth from the Father and Sonne, cannot be comprehended by reaſon; It is enough that by faith we are to beleeve ſo, for no wonder the doctrine of the Trinity is inexplicable, ſeeing the nature of God is ineffable. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Auſtin</hi> having diſcourſed about the Trinity, concludeth, that he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only he had ſpoken ſomething of God: <hi>Si autem dixi, non eſt hoc quod dicere volui hoc unde ſcio, niſi quia Deus ineffabilis eſt? Quod autem a me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt, ſi ineffabile eſſet, non eſſet dictum, ac per hoc ne ineffabilis quidem dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus eſt Deus. quia &amp; hoc cum dicitur, aliquid dicitur, &amp; fit neſcio quae pugna verborum, quoniam ſi illud eſt ineffabile quod dici non poteſt, non eſt ineffabile, quod velut ineffabile dici poteſt. De Doctrinâ Chriſtianâ. lib.</hi> 1. But that by the way.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Here is the ſubject wherein, and that is ſaid to be <hi>in our hearts:</hi> So that as God doth write his Law in our hearts; Thus he doth alſo infuſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and aſſurance, which doth demonſtrate the ſoveraign power of God over our hearts, he can make them holy when he pleaſeth; he can comfort them when he pleaſeth: No Potentate in the world can do thus: That heart of thine which is not in thy own power, which no man can tame, the grace of God can tame it, that heart which thou deſireſt may be filled with holineſſe and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; God alone can do it. The Obſervation is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That grace wrought in the heart is a ſure earneſt of glory hereafter.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Grace is a ſure earneſt of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He that is holy here, muſt needs be happy hereafter. If thou canſt finde grace in thy ſoul, thou haſt found the Pearl, thou maiſt rejoyce, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but heaven will be thine hereafter. The people of God are not only to look upon grace as grace, but as it is an earneſt of a greater happineſſe: yet how often do the children of God conſider it without thiis reſpect? what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, joy, and holy boldneſſe would it work in thee, to think thou haſt within thee that which aſſureth of eternal glory, as if thou wert already in heaven? This is a reviving truth, that <hi>grace</hi> is <hi>an earneſt of glory,</hi> thou mindeſt grace as it ſubdueth thy corruptions, as it maketh thy heart to be carried out more holily and delightſomely to God, but then thou doſt not attend to it as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. There is a great deal of difference between a ſhilling as a ſingle peece of money, and as an earneſt, it may be of twenty pound more to come. Thus it is very much rejoycing to finde grace at all in thy ſoul, as it is grace; but it doth much more rejoyce as it is an earneſt of more fulneſſe. <hi>Adam</hi> had grace, the <hi>angels</hi> had grace, but grace was not given them, as part of an inheritance, for they fell from it,</p>
               <p>Let us conſider two Texts of Scriptures, where we have this earneſt ſpoken <note place="margin">Places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture where this earneſt is ſpoken of. 1. 2 Cor. 5. 5.</note> of.

Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, who alſo hath given unto us the earneſt of his ſpirit.</hi> What is that ſelf ſame thing he ſpeaketh of? it is a groaning and an earneſt deſire after immortality; we would gladly be out of this burden here, and in heaven; yea, as we groan and deſire, ſo we are aſſured and know, that
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:48709:338"/>
when we ſhall dye, we ſhall go to heaven. But now becauſe theſe are things far above the power of nature, we naturally are afraid of death, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be taken from our relations, we have not ſuch aſſurance of heaven. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that doth work us,</hi> frame and poliſh us, <hi>for this great thing it is God.</hi> We could never do it without his ſupernatural aſſiſtance: But then how doth God work this admirable frame of heart? it is <hi>by the earneſt of his ſpirit;</hi> we have the beginnings of heaven already. So that as the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> by the bunches of raiſons, had ſome foretaſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo have beleevers ſome taſte of heaven by what they feel already; and as <hi>Moſes</hi> from Mount <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah</hi> could behold <hi>Canaan,</hi> though he did not enter into it: thus thou haſt a ſight of heaven, and an entrance into it by the grace begun in thee.</p>
               <p>The other Text is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. where the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>That we were ſealed by the ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> he addeth, <hi>which is the earneſt of our inheritance,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Eph. 1. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion.</hi> We are not yet brought into heaven, into <hi>Canaan;</hi> We are yet in the wilderneſſe, we meet with many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and temptations threatning us, that we ſhall never come there, but only this <hi>earneſt</hi> doth aſſure us and ſatisfie us: So that as among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance was not to be alienated from the Tribe, in the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> it would return again to the true owner. Thus this inheritance of heaven will never be taken from thee. Thou maiſt be in ſome dangers and fears of loſing of it, by thy unwiſe carriage, but ſhalt not be deprived of it.</p>
               <p>Before we enlarge on this ſubject, it is good to take notice of the diſſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <note place="margin">How grace and an earneſt differ?</note> as well as the ſimilitude; for though grace wrought in us be compared to an <hi>earneſt</hi> in this reſpect, as it doth aſſure us of future glory, yet in other reſpects it greatly differeth from earneſt among men.</p>
               <p>As in the firſt place, <hi>An earneſt in bargains is to aſſure the buyer that giveth it as well as the ſeller,</hi> they mutually hereby are confirmed; ſo that the buyer <note place="margin">1. An earneſt aſſures both buyer and ſeller.</note> cannot honeſtly fly off any more than the ſeller: But now when the ſpirit of God worketh this <hi>earneſt</hi> in us, it is only for our good, it is that we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and confirmed. As for God, he doth it not to aſſure himſelf of us, but that we may be aſſured of him: Indeed by conſequent this aſſureth us to God, for having this earneſt we are preſerved from Apoſtacy, but the chief end is to confirm our faith in God, that we may be able with <hi>Paul</hi> to triumph, becauſe <hi>nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt.</hi> It is then Gods gracious goodneſſe to condeſcend to us, he knoweth our temper, and our temptations; he ſeeth how one doubt ariſeth up after another; he taketh notice how apt we are to perplex our ſelves about the future, and therefore he giveth us this <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi> not for his own ſecurity, but ours: This is more than his meer promiſe, therefore the <hi>Civilians</hi> define an <hi>earneſt</hi> to be a reall ſecurity, in oppoſition to that which is verball or conventionall only. Gods promiſe is enough to ſecure us: but becauſe we walk much according to ſenſe, therefore he doth indulge thus farre, as to work in us, while in this valley of tears, the beginnings of eternall glory hereafter. In which reſpect, we are already ſaid to <hi>ſit down with Chriſt in heavenly places,</hi> Eph. 2. 6. and certainly if to a godly mans ſence and experience, the foretaſting of heaven be ſo great and refreſhing, what is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf? If an <hi>earneſt</hi> be ſo wonderfull a matter, what is the poſſeſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance it ſelf?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This heavenly earneſt differeth from a worldly one, becauſe amongſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. An earneſt is done in a communita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive way of juſtice.</note> 
                  <hi>men this is done in a commutative way of juſtice.</hi> There is a ſtrict equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the payment to be made, of which the <hi>earneſt</hi> is part, and the thing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed thereby: So that in humane contracts, an <hi>earneſt</hi> is given as part of that payment which is equivalent to the thing purchaſed thereby. So that this whole way of commerce belongs to the common place of juſtice. Thus thoſe who write <hi>de Jure</hi> and <hi>juſtitia,</hi> do under that treat, <hi>De pignoribus &amp; hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="653" facs="tcp:48709:338"/>
but (alas) in this <hi>earneſt</hi> God giveth us, here is no bargain, here is no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, all is of free-grace; God doth beſtow both the earneſt and the whole ſum, as it were, hereafter upon us <hi>freely.</hi> Both grace here, and glory hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do alone proceed from the ſole bounty and free-love of God. Inſomuch that the childe of God is both begotten, nouriſhed and perfected by free-grace alone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is another diſſimilitude flowing from the former, for he who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. By an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> 
                  <hi>giveth an earneſt, intending thereby a full payment for ſomething he would have, doth thereby purpoſe to advantage himſelf.</hi> He would not give an earneſt, but becauſe he needeth the thing he buyeth, and thereupon would profit himſelf; but it is farre otherwiſe with God and us in this reſpect; God giveth us not this <hi>earneſt,</hi> this grace, no nor glory hereafter, becauſe he needeth us, but it is only for our good and conſolation. It is true, that Chriſt gave no leſſe than his own blood as a price to purchaſe us for a people to himſelf: But why was this? Was this to advantage himſelf? Was it ſuch purchaſings as when men buy houſes and lands to inrich themſelves and their poſterity? No, but only to do us good thereby; So that herein is the goodneſſe of God exceedingly commended unto us, that both the purchaſing of us, and giving us an earneſt to ſecure us of future glory, all is from his own munificence. In all this we are unprofitable and uſeleſſe as to him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Here is this diſſimilitude, and that is a great one; <hi>Amongſt men when</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. An earneſt is oft loſt.</note> 
                  <hi>the earneſt is given, yet there is ſometimes upon a just cauſe, and more often upon unjuſt grounds, a breaking of the bargain.</hi> They will loſe the earneſt rather than pay the whole ſum; So that the <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> diſpute to whom the <hi>earneſt</hi> in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence belongs, if the covenant be not made good. Thus becauſe man is a lyar and deceitfull, an earneſt is not ſuch ſecurity, that we may abſolutely depend upon it: Men are mutable, and are apt to break their engagements, but it is farre otherwiſe in this particular; God that hath given the earneſt, is not as man to repent and to change his minde; No, this is given us on purpoſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us that he will never alter: and if it be ſaid, though God doth not alter, yet we may; We may abuſe this earneſt, yea, we may loſe it, all which the <hi>Arminians</hi> pleade. It is more fully to be cleared, that this earneſt is to aſſure not only God to us, but us to God, whereby he will ſo preſerve us, that nothing ſhall deprive us of eternal glory.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the handling of which hitherto, we have only treated of the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude that is between this <hi>heavenly earneſt, and an earneſt amongſt men:</hi> our work is now to ſhew poſitively, wherein the reſemblance doth conſiſt, or what is comprehended in this metaphorical expreſſion. <note place="margin">What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the earneſt of Gods Spirit. 1. Gods will to bring us to ſalvation.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And Firſt, <hi>Hereby is declared Gods will and infallible purpoſe to bring us unto eternal glory;</hi> of which this grace received is an <hi>earneſt.</hi> For (as you heard) it is not grace as grace, but grace as an <hi>earneſt,</hi> that doth deſerve an accent, as it were, upon it: The emphaſis lieth in this. So that by theſe beginnings of Gods Spirit upon me, I may unqueſtionably conclude my future glory. And this <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon the place doth well obſerve: <hi>He doth not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſingly and barely call it the ſpirit, but an earneſt,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that from this thou maiſt have boldneſſe and confidence upon the whole, for if he did not intend to give thee all</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he would not have given thee this earneſt in vain, and ſo as to loſe it.</hi> Thus <hi>Macarius</hi> alſo an holy Writer, from this ſimilitude gathereth, that ſuch who have this <hi>earneſt</hi> may rejoyce, and be as confident as if they were already crowned with glory, and reigning in heaven. <hi>Homil.</hi> 17. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; oh then the unſpeakable happineſſe of ſuch who do finde this <hi>earneſt</hi> in their hearts! God would be found unfaithful, and to break his promiſe, if as he hath begun, ſo he ſhould not alſo finiſh this work of grace in thee. So that the <hi>Arminian</hi> exception is very frivolous and abſurd, ſaying, It is true, this is an earneſt, but we may loſe it: We may fall into ſuch ſinnes as ſhall wholly caſt us out of the favour of God: for this <hi>earneſt</hi> is given us on purpoſe, to aſſure us that God will ſo preſerve us, and by his grace ſo guide us, that we ſhall never fall out of this ark into the waters. What comfort and encouragement were in this expreſſion, if it did denote no more then a conditional ſecurity; No, it is a poſitive and abſolute ſecurity. Therefore that learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> was under ſome temptation ſurely, when he wrote that <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hiſtory; for in that he hath this paſſage, where ſpeaking of ſome Ancients, who from the metaphor of an <hi>anchor</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> conclude the certainty of eternal life, gloſſeth after this manner, <hi>Hiſtor. Pelag. lib. 6. Theſ. 13. Certos nos dicunt, quamdiu habemus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhabonem spiritus ſancti ſed arrhabonem hunc ſiquis abjiciat, hinc certitudinem ſimul ſalutis amittere: We are certain of eternal life, as long as we have this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:48709:339"/>
this earneſt; but if we loſe it, we loſe our certainty alſo of ſalvation.</hi> How inexcuſable is this, though ſome learned men, great friends to that excellent Authour ſay, that he promiſed to review that Hiſtory of <hi>Pelagian</hi> hereſie in time? For therefore is this earneſt given us to take away our fears about the future: Whereas in their ſenſe we muſt needs be as uncertain as before; and beſides this <hi>earneſt</hi> would need another earneſt, and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi> The Scripture then by calling it an <hi>earneſt</hi> would hereby inform us of Gods will, that he who hath given us the firſt-fruits will in time alſo give us the lump or harveſt it ſelf: he will ſo preſerve us, that not only any thing without, as the devil and the world, but alſo any thing within us, our own hearts, our own luſts ſhall not betray us, and become our deſtruction: and certanily that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Chryſoſtowe,</hi> which is alſo grounded upon the Scripture, is among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers very remarkable. If God of his free-grace did (while enemies) convert us, and beſtow his ſpirit as an <hi>earneſt</hi> upon us, will he not much rather do it for us, ſince he hath received us into his friendſhip? To this purpoſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alſo argueth very ſtrongly, <hi>Rom. 5. 9, 10. While we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us, much more then being now juſtified by his bloud, ſhall we be ſaved from wrath through him: for if when we were enemies we were reconciled by death of his Sonne, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his liſe.</hi> If then God hath done the greater, will he not do the leſſe? when we wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in our luſts, when we tumbled in our filth, even then the grace of God did ſpeak unto us to live, even then it did put comelineſſe and beauty upon us, and ſhall he not much more do it ſince he hath made us his own? So that the ſame grace of God which received us, though unworthy, will preſerve us, though unworthy: and as our rebellious heart did not finally withſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace, but was overcome by it, ſo will the grace of perſeverance watch over us, that this <hi>earneſt</hi> ſhall not be totally loſt. For this end we have many glorious promiſes to encourage us in this particular; we muſt not then look upon our own dead womb, but the power and promiſe of God, concluding by this, Lord, I know thy will is, that I ſhall be ſaved, by this I am perſwaded, that nothing, no, not I my ſelf, ſhall ſeparate my ſelf from thy love, for thy grace will alwaies prevent my will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In that it is called an earneſt, there is implyed, that grace here and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. That grace and glory are of the ſame nature.</note> 
                  <hi>glory hereafter are of the ſame nature;</hi> that they differ only gradually: Even as in an <hi>earneſt</hi> amongſt men, that is part of the full payment, and of the ſame nature with it. Thus <hi>grace</hi> is nothing but <hi>glory</hi> begun, and <hi>glory grace</hi> perfected; for which cauſe it is called <hi>glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>We are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi> that is, <hi>from grace to grace,</hi> till we come to inhabit glory: For which cauſe alſo the Apoſtle compareth our ſtate of grace here to the ſtate of a childe, and that of <hi>glory</hi> hereafter to a virile eſtate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Now as a childe differeth from himſelf when made a man but gradually, he is the ſame individuall perſon ſtill. Thus it is here, thy grace will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed thou haſt here, but perfected: We do but think and underſtand in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things as children only; comparatively to what ſhall be done in heaven. Even as theſe individual bodies ſhall put on immortality and incorruptibility: They ſhall not be new bodies, but changed bodies. It is true, there are ſome graces which ſuppoſe an imperfection in the ſubject, while he is here in the way, at leaſt in their actings, and ſo farre as there is imperfection, it ſhall be aboliſhed: as 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 13. Thus ſaith, as it juſtifieth, as it is oppoſed to viſion, and hope as oppoſed to enjoying; repentance likewiſe as it is ſorrow for ſin, and patience which ſuppoſeth afflictions. Theſe things cannot be put forth in heaven, but probably the habits of theſe graces may continue there, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ornament and perfection of the ſoul; it being extrinſecal only, and by accident, that the occaſion of the exerciſe of thoſe graces is removed, Hence
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:48709:340"/>
(ſome ſay) but not probably, that the Spirit of God is a <hi>pledge</hi> in reſpect of faith and hope, becauſe they ſhall ceaſe, but an <hi>earneſt</hi> in reſpect of charity, which abideth for ever. <hi>Salmeron in loc.</hi> No wonder then <hi>if grace be an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of glory,</hi> ſeeing they are the ſame thing in nature, and differ only as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and imperfect; yet when we ſay, that <hi>grace is only glory begun,</hi> that muſt be underſtood in a ſound ſenſe: for ſome of the Papiſts make an inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity between <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory:</hi> we are not then to think, that grace of it ſelf would in a naturall and neceſſary way ſpring up into glory, as an Acorn would (in a phyſicall manner) breed up into an Oak, being ſeminally and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally contained in it. No, but in a moral ſenſe, by the gracious appointment and order of God; <hi>grace</hi> is <hi>glory</hi> begun, otherwiſe ſuch is the imperfection and droſſe that is in our graces while in this life, that when we have arrived to the higheſt pitch, we might juſtly be deprived of glory. Grace in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Angels formerly, was not glory ſeminally and radically, for then they had not miſſed it: But if we do now regard the covenant of Gods grace, he hath ſo appointed it, that whoſoever hath grace here, that ſhall be preſerved and kept ſo faithfully, that it ſhall be perfected into glory hereafter. And thus the earneſt is of the ſame nature with the full payment it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, This ſimilitude doth not only declare Gods purpoſe and <note place="margin">3. That heaven ſhall as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ours as if we were already in it.</note> effectuall will concerning us, but it is alſo <hi>to aſſure and perſwade us of heaven, as if we were already in it:</hi> and this is indeed one of the main ends of this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. God will by this inform us of the tranſcendant excellency of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace above that of works, which he made with <hi>Adam;</hi> Thus our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh. 5. 24. He that beleeveth is paſſed from death to life, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</hi> and therefore is ſure of everlaſting happineſſe; ſo that in this ſimilitude there is not only the <hi>perſeverance</hi> of the Saints denoted, but alſo their <hi>aſſurance</hi> and <hi>certain perſwaſion</hi> of it. And the truth is, great is the neceſſity of this doctrine; for while a godly man looketh upon what is to come, he ſeeth ſuch a terrible wilderneſſe he is to go through, ſuch a Red Sea to paſſe over, ſuch <hi>Anakims</hi> in the way to be deſtroyed, that had he not this certain perſwaſion, that he ſhall overcome all theſe difficulties, and that God would daily hold him in his arms of grace, that he ſhall not fall, his doubts and fears would wholly diſhearten him. And thus much is comprehended in the metaphor of an <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</hi> It is not my purpoſe at this time to lanch into that ocean of the doctrine of perſeverance, as alſo the certainty of it. I ſhall therefore amplifie this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, with ſome few propoſitions, and ſo conclude it; for the excellency and comfortableneſſe of it will not let us wholly paſſe it by: This precious flower can be found only in the paradiſe of the Scripture; Therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi> was weary of <hi>Platonical</hi> Books, becauſe they had not theſe excellent things in them, the Scripture hath, whereof this <hi>arra spiritus, the earneſt of the ſpirit</hi> is one he inſtanceth in, <hi>lib. confeſ. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>As firſt, We muſt know, that <hi>comfort of perſeverance is only improved by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by thoſe that are certain of the work of grace in them.</note> 
                  <hi>thoſe, that are certain of the preſent work of grace in their ſouls.</hi> He that findeth grace for the preſent in his ſoul, may undoubtedly conclude of his ſalvation hereafter; but if a Chriſtian do lie in doubts, whether he hath grace or no, this doctrine will not be as the honey-comb to him, for he hath not laid the foundation that this muſt be built upon: but if his thoughts about the preſent work of grace be hopefull only in him, then alſo are his thoughts about per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance hopefull only: He may have ſome comfort, but not ſuch a certainty as the Scripture propoundeth: Neither can he uſe thoſe triumphing expreſſions of holy confidence, which <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 8. ſpeaketh not of himſelf, by any peculiar revelation, but of all the children of God, that nothing ſhall ſeparate him from the love of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="657" facs="tcp:48709:340"/>
Secondly, There are ſome Doctors and Teachers, who make the <hi>certainty</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. There are divers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>of our preſent grace, and of perſeverance therein, two diſtinct, yea, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things.</hi> They will grant that a man may be certain of the preſent grace he hath, but then they deny he is to be certain that he ſhall continue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in this; for they affirm, that a man may have true grace, and yet totally and finally fall from it; others ſay, that a man may have grace, and not be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch may loſe it, but he that hath true grace and elected, that man ſhall never loſe his intereſt in heaven: Nay, ſome of theſe Teachers do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any ſuch certainty of perſeverance in our preſent grace either ordinarily poſſible or neceſſary. But ſay ſuch a certainty would be very dangerous and deſtructive to all vigilancy and carefulneſſe in an holy life; for what a man is aſſured of, he cannot fear he ſhall loſe, let him live how he will; but this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another account is in time to be more largely debated. Therefore for the preſent I only adde this third Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the certainty which the godly have, is not ſuch an abſolute abſtracted one,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Certainty of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth not exclude means.</note> 
                  <hi>as that it doth not include the means leading to ſalvation, but rather doth neceſſarily connote them.</hi> Inſomuch that if any godly man ſhould be left to ſuch a deſperate frame of heart, as to ſay, I am ſure of heaven, let me fall into the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable impieties that are, theſe ſhall not hinder ſalvation; ſuch an one would certainly be damned: but that is not to be ſuppoſed, that ſuch who have the true ſeed of grace, will ever be given up to ſuch a prophane ſpirit. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty then that a beleever hath, is in the uſe of means to attain their deſired end; So that it's like, the aſſurance that <hi>Paul</hi> had concerning the preſervation God would vouch ſafe to all his fellow-paſſengers in the ſhip with him, which yet did relate to the neceſſary uſe of means, as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth them; or like that of <hi>Hezckiah,</hi> to whom God promiſed the addition of fifteen years longer to his life. Now he was aſſured of this, God could not lye, yet he did not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to eat and drink; he knew Gods promiſe implyed the uſe of the means, ſo that the adverſaries to this Truth do fully miſtake, when they ſay, we preach ſuch a certainty of perſeverance, that though a man fall into any enormous crimes, yet he ſhall enjoy this ſtill: This is <hi>oppoſitum in appoſito</hi> to ſuppoſe, that if fire be water, it will refrigerate.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>We are further to diſtinguiſh of a two-fold certainty in this matter of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is either 1. dogmaticall, or</note> 
                  <hi>ſalvation and perſeverance in the way therein.</hi> The firſt I call a <hi>dogmaticall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> and that is when a man is fully convinced out of the Scripture of this truth in the generall, that whoſoever hath once had true grace, ſhall never fall from it, but certainly ſhall be ſaved; and he that hath this, differeth from thoſe corrupt and erroneous Teachers that affirm the contrary, as the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and their complyers in this reſpect: for there is no more reaſon to doubt of this doctrinal point, than others that are maintained by the Orthodox a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that party; ſo that there is no more reaſon to make this a problematical point, wherein learned men may diſſent from one another, then any other in the Arminian controverſies. But 2. there is a <hi>perſonal</hi> or <hi>reflexive certainty;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Perſonal.</note> and that is when a man doth not only beleeve this poſition as a truth, that he who hath true grace cannot fall from it, but alſo is perſwaded, that he hath true grace in his own heart, and therefore that he is built upon ſuch a rock, that no ſtorms or tempeſts ſhall be able to overthrow him, and this is that every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is to preſſe after: This text is a ſpeciall furtherance in this work, for the <hi>ſpirits fealing</hi> perſwadeth of the grace already wrought in us, and the <hi>earneſt</hi> doth aſſure us of that which is to come. If you ask, what grounds there are, why <note place="margin">Reaſons why they who have this earneſt cannot fall away. 1.</note> he who findes grace in himſelf may thus conclude infallibly for heaven hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? I ſhall amongſt many give three only, which is ſuch a threefold cord that can never be broken.</p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>That all true grace is the proper effect of predeſtination;</hi> ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:48709:341"/>
is effectually called in time, is thereby declared to be predeſtinated before the world began. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 8 30. whom he did predeſtinate, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and thoſe he juſtifieth, and thoſe he glorifieth.</hi> You ſee it's a chain of Gods making, and ſo cannot be diſſolved; therefore <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. it's called the <hi>faith of Gods elect:</hi> ſo <hi>Eph. 1. 4. he hath choſen us before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy.</hi> We ſee then, that holineſſe and true faith is proper to the elect only, and therefore to diſtinguiſh of a two-fold Sonſhip of God; ſome by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent grace only, and ſome by election alſo, and that there are perſevering ſons and apoſtatizing, wherein election maketh the difference (which opinion ſome attribute to <hi>Auſtin)</hi> is wholly inconſiſtent with Scripture, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in other places, if that were his opinion. The godly then are to look upon the grace of God wrought in them as the effect of Gods immutable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable love, which will certainly obtain its end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their certainty of ſalvation, and ſo of perſeverance therein, is <note place="margin">2.</note> built upon the <hi>many promiſes of God, which are made to this very end,</hi> as that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one, <hi>Jer. 32. 40. I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, but will put my fear in their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> What can be more pregnant than this? God cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants <hi>he will not turn from them;</hi> and withall <hi>to put ſuch fear in their hearts that they ſhall not turn from him.</hi> So alſo <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. being confident of this very thing, <hi>that he who hath begun a good work in you will alſo finiſh it.</hi> His confidence was not in them; for alas, we ſhould prove the prodigals, and loſe all; but it is in Gods grace, and that becauſe <hi>he had begun;</hi> for none ſhall ſay of him, he began to build, and could not finiſh: So that the wiſedom, mercy, and glory of God is intereſted in our perſeverance, and indeed if our ſinnes ſhould hinder him from continuance of his grace, why did they not from the beginning at firſt? were we not then objects of his diſpleaſure? So that in our converſion the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt work was done; then we had, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith upon the place, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and root of what was to come.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>The union that is between Chriſt and a beleever being indiſſoluble,</hi> doth neceſſarily infer the certainty of his ſalvation, a member of Chriſts body ſhall <note place="margin">3.</note> not be taken from him, and thrown into hell; for from this union as their bodies ſhall neceſſarily riſe to glory, ſo their ſouls alſo ſhall be prepared for the ſame.</p>

               <p>Of the <hi>Oath</hi> firſt. As for <hi>Pelagians</hi> and others, who affirm an <hi>Oath</hi> to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, under the Goſpel at leaſt, and that in theſe or the like expreſſions; <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſwear, becauſe he doth not uſe the Prepoſition <hi>per,</hi> or <hi>by,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Greek, it's an abſurdity afterwards to be refelled.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Oath</hi> in the Text is an <hi>Aſſertory Oath,</hi> wherein God is expreſly called upon as a <hi>witneſſe;</hi> and withall an <hi>Execration</hi> is added, <hi>Upon my ſoul,</hi> that is, <hi>Let God damn my ſoul, if it be not true:</hi> he doth not mention his ſoul, as part of the <hi>Oath,</hi> as if that were a <hi>witneſſe</hi> as well as God; but he mentioneth it as a pawn or pledge; and ſo it is lawfull to name ſome creatures that we love, or are dear to us, in an oath; not that we may ſwear by them, but as pledges. So that this <hi>Oath</hi> is both <hi>Aſſertory</hi> and <hi>Execratory;</hi> not that theſe make two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct kindes of <hi>Oaths;</hi> for one doth neceſſarily imply the other: He that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon God as a Witneſſe, doth thereby imply him a Judge and an Avenger, if he ſwear falſly. Onely I call it an <hi>Execratory Oath,</hi> as well as an <hi>Aſſertory,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Execration</hi> is mentioned; whereas for the moſt part in <hi>Oaths</hi> it is not expreſſed.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, <hi>What reaſon or urgent neceſſity was here for</hi> Paul <hi>thus to make ſuch a deliberate and ſolemn Oath?</hi>

                  <pb n="658" facs="tcp:48709:342"/>
I anſwer, Very great. The adverſaries of <hi>Paul</hi> did accuſe him and traduce him for a vain and inconſtant perſon, which hereby did redound to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour of the Miniſtry, the hinderance of the Goſpel, the deſtruction of Chriſts Church; therefore it was neceſſary for him to take this <hi>Oath, That no carnal motive made him delay his promiſe, but a wiſe and ſpiritual conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their good.</hi> Thus at another time, ſpeaking of his earneſt affections to his brethren after the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1. he ſweareth after this manner, <hi>I ſpeake the truth in Chriſt, I lie not, my conſcience alſo bearing witneſſe in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So in this Epiſtle again, 2 <hi>Corinth. 11. 20. As the truth of Chriſt is in me.</hi> Rom. 1. 9. <hi>For God is my witneſſe that I make mention of you alwayes in my prayers.</hi> Gal. 1. 20. <hi>The things that I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee by many inſtances, the holy Apoſtle making uſe of an <hi>Oath,</hi> but alwayes upon neceſſary occaſions for Gods glory, and the edification of others. From whence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is lawfull even under the Gospel, to ſwear after a right and godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">It is lawfull under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to ſwear after a right manner upon neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</note> 
                  <hi>upon neceſſary and urgent occaſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>under the Gospel;</hi> for ſome have granted it lawfull under the Old Teſtament, as (they ſay) to circumciſe, to ſacrifice was; but under the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> they hold it abſolutely forbidden.</p>
               <p>So that the handling of this truth about <hi>ſwearing,</hi> or a <hi>lawfull oath,</hi> is of great importance, both for doctrinal information againſt <hi>Pelagians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who hold it unlawfull under the Goſpel: As alſo of direction, to know wherein an <hi>Oath</hi> doth conſiſt; and whether many formes uſed commonly by people are oaths, or no. And then withall, it is of great practical uſe, if poſſible, to remove that ungodly and wicked cuſtome of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſwearing, without any due conſideration of the nature of an oath. For how general and epidemical is this ſinne? Old and young, yea little children can ſwear as ſoon as ſpeake; rich and poore; yea men glory in their oaths, and deride at the ſtrictneſſe of ſuch, who will be ſo preciſe, as to abſtaine from them. They looke upon oathes as the glory of their ſpeech, and becoming a Gentleman. But <hi>Solomon's</hi> deſcription of a <hi>godly man</hi> will abide good, when ſuch prophane miſcreants, ſhall lie for ever roaring in hell, <hi>viz. That he is one who feareth an oath,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 2. <hi>A righteous man, a good man,</hi> and he that <hi>feareth an oath,</hi> are ſynonymous expreſſions. You ſee then what a fruitfull field we are plowing up: but I ſhall not venture upon all the caſes about <hi>Oaths,</hi> which would require a great volume; onely limit my ſelf to my Text, which containeth onely an <hi>aſſertory Oath,</hi> not a <hi>promiſſory.</hi> And indeed becauſe it is the moſt formal and expreſſe oath that we meet with in the Scripture, we muſt improve it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſert of it.</p>
               <p>Two ſorts of perſons there are who have runne into extreames about an <hi>Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Such who out of a great reverence to God, and becauſe every mans word ſhould be as good and as firm as an <hi>Oath,</hi> have therefore <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed to uſe it.</hi> To ſuch we ſhall prove the lawfulneſſe of it; Yea the neceſſity and duty of it in ſome caſes. On the other extream are many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and wretched men, who <hi>uſe theſe ſacred Oaths in all ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> vainly, irreverently; yea ſometimes ariſe to ſuch high impiety and wickedneſſe, as not onely to ſwear raſhly and vainly, but alſo falſly, ſo as to forſwear themſelves, and become guilty of perjury; a ſinne ſo contrary to the light of nature, that <hi>Heathens</hi> have ſeverely puniſhed it. And God
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:48709:342"/>
doth ſeldome let ſuch perjured perſons goe unpuniſhed in this world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome remarkable puniſhment. For that terrible threatning will not prove falſe or a lie, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 3, 4. where a <hi>flying roll,</hi> that is, the curſe of God, is ſaid, <hi>To enter into the houſe of him that ſweareth falſly, and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his houſe, and ſhall conſume it with the timber thereof, and the ſtones thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before we come to theſe particulars, let us firſt conſider of the nature of <note place="margin">What an oath is.</note> an <hi>Oath</hi> (an <hi>aſſertory</hi> one eſpecially, for that is my ſubject) what it is, and we may define it to be,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A religious calling upon God, as a witneſſe, for the confirmation of any thing in doubt or controverſie.</hi> The <hi>Latines</hi> call it <hi>juramentum,</hi> or <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurandum,</hi> which is all one, though ſome would make a difference; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that an <hi>Oath</hi> doth <hi>jus,</hi> or <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſome make to come of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to conſtringe and bind, becauſe an oath brings a bond or ſtrict obligation upon a mans ſoul. Thus <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 2, 3, 4. In a <hi>vow,</hi> which in this reſpect agreeth with an oath, therefore it is added, <hi>Or ſwear an Oath,</hi> a man or woman are thereby ſaid, <hi>To binde their ſoule with a bond.</hi> The Hebrew word is ordinarily <hi>Shebugna,</hi> which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from <hi>Shebang,</hi> the number of <hi>ſeven,</hi> becauſe an <hi>Oath</hi> uſeth to be amongſt many witneſſes: and withall it is obſerved, that the word to <hi>ſwear</hi> is uſed in <hi>Niphal,</hi> a <hi>paſſive voice,</hi> ſignifying thereby, that a man is not to <hi>ſwear,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he be (as it were) ſolemnly compelled unto it.</p>
               <p>Now this definition given of an <hi>Oath,</hi> hath in it four parts:</p>
               <p>The <hi>generical Nature,</hi> the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>End.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The</hi> generical Nature, <hi>it is a</hi> religious calling.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The</hi> Form, upon God as a witneſſe.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The</hi> Matter, <hi>which is</hi> doubtfull and controverſal.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Laſtly, The <hi>End,</hi> or the <hi>Effect</hi> (as ſome diſpute) which is the <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this.</hi> For after <hi>Oaths</hi> there is to be no more arguing. Hence <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> ſaith well, <hi>That what firſt principles are in ſpeculatives, the ſame is an Oath in practicals.</hi> Now as <hi>firſt principles</hi> are indemonſtrable, and none may deny them, or goe to prove them, ſo is an <hi>Oath;</hi> it is an artificial argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove a thing indemonſtrably. And thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defined, That it was an indemonſtrable argument or word without proof, with a reverent and ſacred uſe, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Let us conſider this definition, upon which ſome Caſes and Queſtions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are afterwards to be built. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſay, <hi>It is a religious calling upon God.</hi> Hence an <hi>Oath</hi> is the <note place="margin">1. It is a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calling upon God.</note> worſhip of God; when a man ſweareth in a right manner, he giveth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory to God, believing him to be Omniſcient, and a ſearcher of the heart; as alſo an holy Judge, who will puniſh and be avenged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſuch, who ſhall take his Name in vaine. Hence it is reckoned in Scripture as part of Divine Worſhip, <hi>Deuter. 6. 10. Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him, and ſhalt ſweare by his Name.</hi> So <hi>Deuter. 10. 20. Thou ſhalt cleave to him, and ſwear by his Name.</hi> Yea the whole worſhip of God is ſometimes ſynecdochically contained in this action onely, <hi>Iſaiah 45. 23. To me every tongue ſhall ſwear.</hi> Thus it is made a prophetical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Goſpel-times, <hi>That he who ſweareth, ſhall ſwear by the God of truth,</hi> by which all Goſpel-worſhip is intended, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 16. Oh how little is this
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:48709:343"/>
conſidered by common ſwearers, whoſe mouths are filled with daily oaths. Doe you conſider what an Oathis? Doe you remember it is a ſolemne worſhip of God? If God were an Idol, yea a man, you could not more abuſe and deſpiſe his holy Name than thou doeſt. Is this to worſhip God? Every oath ſhould be with holy fear and trembling at the Majeſty of God: But thou tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt his honour prophanely under thy foot. Judge ye, how prophane you your ſelves would think men to be, if they ſhould be ſo vain and cuſtomary in other holy worſhip. Should a man take the holy <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and ſing them as idlely, and as vainly, as he doth ordinary ſongs, would you not call ſuch a man a prophane man? Prayer alſo that is a worſhip of God, ſhould a man in his prayer be no more reverent than in his merry tales, or idle diſcourſe, would you not ſay, ſuch a man was a vile wretch? Take the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, Should a man receive that with no more reverence than he doth his ordinary food; ſhould he make no difference between the Lords Cup, and a Cup of Ale at the Ale-houſe; Would ye not gnaſh your teeth at ſuch a man, as an atheiſtical perſon? And is it any leſſe prophaneneſſe, when you make <hi>oaths,</hi> and your ordinary diſcourſe all one? The very word <hi>Sacrament</hi> was taken from an <hi>Oath,</hi> as the learned ſhew: What ſhall be done unto thee then thou ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and curſing tongue? Every trifle, every paſſion ſetteth thy tongue thus on fire from hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Again I ſay, <hi>It is a religious calling upon God.</hi> For an <hi>Oath</hi> may be either pronounced <hi>ſpeculatively,</hi> and <hi>enuntiatively,</hi> or <hi>practicè,</hi> and <hi>invocativè;</hi> practically, and by way of invocation: As for example; when I reade this Text, <hi>I call God to witneſſe upon my ſoul;</hi> while I doe ſo, I doe not ſwear; yet <hi>Paul</hi> when he expreſſed them, he did ſwear. For I onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them enuntiatively, and by recitation; I doe not practically call upon God. Thus when a Magiſtrate, or any inferiour Officer readeth a forme of an Oath to him who ſhall ſwear, this reading of it doth not make him ſwear, becauſe he doth it not by calling upon God.</p>
               <p>In the next place, There is the <hi>Forme of this Oath,</hi> and that is, <hi>Calling upon God, as a witneſſe.</hi> A two-fold forme we may ſpeak of in an <hi>Oath, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. It is a calling upon God as a witneſſe.</note> and that is, when God is called to <hi>witneſſe:</hi> Or <hi>External,</hi> and that is a forme of words. Of which in its time, becauſe many Diſputes are, whether ſuch formes be Oaths or no? For the preſent, <hi>The Internal,</hi> is <hi>God called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a witneſſe.</hi> Inſomuch that all oaths made by creatures, or ſwearing by them, is utterly unlawfull. For ſeeing to ſwear is (as you heard) a divine Worſhip, it muſt needs be Idolatry to give this worſhip to any other but God. Neither will the Popiſh diſtinction of <hi>ſwearing by a creature tranſitivè,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lativè,</hi> with reference to God; and <hi>terminativè,</hi> or <hi>abſolutè,</hi> be able to make eſcape from the jealouſie of God in this matter, as is to be ſhewed. Although not onely <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but even many <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> are guilty of this Idolatry, to ſwear by Saints and Angels, by creatures irrational, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. But woe be to ſuch, becauſe of their horrible offences in this kinde! Now when we ſay, <hi>God is called upon as a witneſſe;</hi> hereby is declared, That an Oath in its nature tends to the glory of God; for it is built upon this fundamental Article of Faith, <hi>That God hath an all-ſeeing eye,</hi> as alſo an <hi>avenging one,</hi> where men deale perfidiouſly, God is called as a <hi>witneſſe,</hi> and ſo by conſequence as a <hi>Judge.</hi> And in this an <hi>Oath</hi> differeth from a <hi>Vow.</hi> For though a <hi>Vow</hi> be alſo a religious worſhip of God, yet in that God is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered (as it were) a <hi>party,</hi> with whom we make a ſacred promiſe; but in an <hi>Oath,</hi> we attend to God as a witneſſe, as he that <hi>knoweth all things.</hi> And therefore how highly do theſe common ſwearers ſinne? For while they ſwear, they make uſe of his name, who knoweth all things, who obſerveth thoſe very words and expreſſions at that time. Certainly this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:48709:343"/>
of Gods witneſſing at that time, ſhould fill thee with much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p>In the third place, There is the <hi>Matter,</hi> and that is <hi>doubtfull</hi> and <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It is in a doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether it be a thing paſt, preſent, or future.</hi> For an <hi>aſſertory Oath</hi> may be about future things; as if a man ſhould ſwear the infallible event of ſuch a thing, which yet he doth not promiſe to accompliſh. This the Apoſtle ſheweth, when he cals an <hi>Oath,</hi> Heb. 6. 6, <hi>The end of a controverſie.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to uſe an <hi>Oath</hi> about manifeſt and evident things, is an abuſe of the end of it. Had <hi>Adam</hi> continued in the ſtate of innocency, there had been no need of Oaths, becauſe there would have been no doubts, no controverſies, there would have been no falſhood or injuſtice amongſt men. But after ſinne came into the world, then man became ſinfull and falſe, as the Devil, that did deceive him. So that although <hi>Oaths</hi> are lawfull in ſome caſes, yet it is becauſe of ſinne: they become neceſſary, becauſe of mans tranſgreſſion. And therefore Divines ſay well, That although an <hi>Oath</hi> be a worſhip of God, yet it is not as other worſhip is, of it ſelf to be deſired, and conſtantly exerciſed, as to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to praiſe God; but onely it is to be deſired <hi>propter aliud,</hi> ſuppoſing ſinne in man going before. Even as Phyſicke is not in it ſelfe to be deſired, but upon ſuppoſition of a diſeaſe; ſo that if mankinde were as honeſt, faithfull and righteous, as they ought to be, there would be no need of <hi>Oaths;</hi> and frequent uſe even of lawfull and neceſſary <hi>Oaths,</hi> ſuppoſe a diſtempered Nation, even as continual uſe of Phyſicians, demonſtrate a diſeaſed people.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Here is the <hi>End of ſwearing,</hi> and that is <gap reason="foreign">

But in the nature of it it is for that end. It is true, your common ſwearers, they doe ſo groſſely abuſe an Oath, that the end is wholly fruſtrated, no ſober man giving them the more credit, becauſe they ſweare: yea the more they ſweare, the more they ſuſpect them for lying.</p>

               <p>THe Definition and lawfulneſſe of an <hi>Oath</hi> in neceſſary and urgent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives being declared, I ſhall proceed to anſwer ſome Caſes or Queſtions, and that from the Deſcription given. Only</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is good to take notice, that there are theſe four things may be uſed to the confirmation of any thing that is ſaid.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>A bare Affirmation,</hi> or <hi>Negation,</hi> according to that command, <hi>Let your communication be yea and nay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When we to this affirmation adde an <hi>Aſſeveration</hi> or <hi>Atteſtation.</hi> Thus our Saviour many times, <hi>Verily, verily;</hi> which is not an oath, as learned men ſhew againſt thoſe, who have thought ſo: ſo when we ſay <hi>truly,</hi> or <hi>indeed,</hi> this is an aſſeveration.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is an <hi>Obteſtation,</hi> and that cometh near to an Oath, but is not an Oath; and that is, when we doe appeale (as it were) to the creatures, to witneſſe ſuch a thing, as <hi>Moſes</hi> to affect the ſenſleſſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and hearken, O Earth.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> (1 Tim. 5. 21.) <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the elect Angels.</hi> He doth not there ſwear, but uſe an <hi>Obteſtation,</hi> and that not onely before <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Angels</hi> alſo; for they are preſent with us, and bear witneſſe of us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, There is an <hi>Oath,</hi> and that is, <hi>When we call upon God as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to confirme what is ſpoken.</hi> I ſay, <hi>When we call upon him as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> For when there is a meer allegation of ſome Text of Scripture, to confirme a truth, there is a witneſſe of God made uſe of, he is then brought as a witneſſe; but it is not an Oath, becauſe it is not by way of Invocation.</p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Oaths</hi> may either be <hi>compleatly</hi> and <hi>perfectly</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as here in the Text: Or elſe <hi>elliptically</hi> or <hi>defectively,</hi> which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary, <hi>If they enter into my reſt; God doe ſo to me, and more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> Many times the creature that is dear to us, we mention, as expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to Gods curſe, if we ſay not truth, and the name of God is not mentioned. This is good to be remembred, becauſe many uſe execratory ſpeeches, and thinke, becauſe God is not named, here is no ſwearing,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:48709:344"/>
whereas they are terrible oaths, ſuch are, <hi>Would I might never ſtirre, would I might be hanged,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are horrible <hi>execratory oaths,</hi> though God be not named.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things premiſed, let us conſider, <hi>What doubts may be raiſed from the forementioned definition of an Oath?</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that an <hi>Oath</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>a religious calling upon God,</hi> it may be <note place="margin">1. Whether words be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to an oath. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> asked, <hi>Whether words be neceſſary to an oath?</hi> May it not be by other ſignes?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer is, That a man may ſwear <hi>mentally,</hi> and in his heart one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe God is a ſearcher of that, and knoweth every thing which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in us.</p>
               <p>And again, Dumb men, as <hi>Zacharias</hi> for inſtance, no doubt might have ſworne by ſome ſignes he might make. Hence the Comical Poet, cited by <hi>Covarruvias</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>It is a firme Oath, though I doe but nodde with my head.</hi> A man alſo may ſwear by writing; and thus the Apoſtles <hi>Oath</hi> is here in the Text by writing. Yea <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s obſervation is, That he doth not remember, that ever the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did ſwear any otherwiſe than in <hi>writing,</hi> not in ſpeech or diſcourſe, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by mouth: And hereby an Oath is made more deliberate. If no men would ſwear, but firſt write it down, it would be a ſpecial means to ſtop much ungodly <hi>ſwearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is, We define an <hi>Oath</hi> to be <hi>a religious calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Whether it be not lawfull to ſwear by the creature.</note> 
                  <hi>God as a witneſſe; Whether then it be not lawfull to ſweare by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> What is more ordinary, not onely amongſt Papiſts, but Proteſtants alſo, than to <hi>ſwear</hi> by the <hi>light,</hi> by this <hi>bread,</hi> by their <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>truth;</hi> and theſe are creatures?</p>
               <p>To this it is anſwered,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Papiſts <hi>(Covarruvias part. prima relect. de juram.)</hi> though <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> they hold an Oath to be a religious worſhip of God, yet they ſay, <hi>we may ſweare by creatures;</hi> but with this diſtinction, not <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatively</hi> ſtaying in them, but <hi>relatively</hi> to God, whoſe power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is eminent in the creatures. But this is an empty diſtinction. For our Saviour doth abſolutely prohibit <hi>to ſweare by the creatures</hi> (Matth. 5.) and the command is often, <hi>to ſweare by God alone;</hi> they are reproved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who <hi>ſweare by God</hi> and <hi>Baal, God</hi> and <hi>Milchom.</hi> For although they were <hi>Idols,</hi> yet the reaſon of the prohibition is, becauſe they are not Gods, and every creature is not a god; therefore it is not lawfull to ſweare by any creature, neither <hi>terminatively</hi> nor <hi>tranſitively;</hi> for all is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, giving the worſhip due to God, unto the creature. It is true, though a man <hi>ſweare by the creature</hi> (which is unlawfull) yet it is an <hi>Oath</hi> for all that, and doth oblige, as our Saviour informed againſt the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees. Non te audit lapis loquentem, ſed Deus te punit fallentem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of the Heatheniſh cuſtome, which was to hold a flint in their hands, while they did ſweare, ſaying, <hi>If I doe deceive, let me be caſt out of the City, as I throw away this ſtone.</hi> This they called ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Pexr Jovem lapidem.</hi> Therefore it is a fooliſh and ſenſleſſe evaſion of many, to ſay, they doe not <hi>ſweare by God,</hi> they are but petty oaths (as is to be ſhewed.) For here is the more Idolatry, when you ſweare by a creature: Is your Faith a God. Is your Troth a God? Is the Light and Bread you ſweare by a God? Theſe oaths were uſual amongſt <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Socrates,</hi> whether it was to deride the <hi>Heathens</hi> opinions about their gods, would ſweare by a <hi>Cocke,</hi> and by a <hi>Dogge.</hi> It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that it might be, men at firſt out of a ſuperſtitious reverence
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:48709:345"/>
to God, did forbeare to ſwear by him; but herein they did more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, while they thought to honour him, which is alwayes the fruit of ſuperſtition. Some Proteſtants indeed <hi>(Calvin</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr)</hi> are ſaid in ſome ſenſe to allow ſwearing by creatures, as the ſymbols of Gods preſence and power: but that is not ſafe; and there is no creature, but in it the power and wiſdome of God doth appear, ſo that then we might ſwear by every creature. God then onely is to be ſworne by; for he alone is the all-ſeeing witneſſe of all that we doe, and omnipotent to puniſh ſuch as ſhall take his Name in vaine. So that thou art not to thinke thou art clean from the diſhonour of God, becauſe thou ſweareſt, but doeſt not name him.</p>
               <p>It is true, two wayes learned men ſay, we may mention a <hi>creature</hi> in an <hi>Oath,</hi> though we do not ſwear by it. And <note place="margin">How we may mention a creature in an oath, and not ſwear by it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is, when we mention it as a <hi>pledge,</hi> in which we deſire God would puniſh us, if we ſay not the truth. As here in the Text, <hi>Paul</hi> doth name his <hi>ſoule,</hi> though he doth not ſweare by it. And in this ſenſe ſome excuſe that ſpeech of <hi>Joſeph's, By the life of Pharaoh,</hi> Geneſ. 42. 15. For (ſay they) his meaning is, <hi>As deare as</hi> Pharaoh's <hi>life is unto me, which I would have God conſtantly preſerve, it is thus and thus.</hi> Even as in the primitive times, though the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> refuſed to ſwear, <hi>Per genium Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoris,</hi> yet they did ſwear <hi>per ſalutem,</hi> as that which was dear unto them. Although for that fact of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſome ſay, it was his ſinne, and condemn him therein, as if by living in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, he had contracted this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cuſtome.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, it is lawfull to mention a <hi>creature in an Oath,</hi> and <note place="margin">Anſw. 2.</note> not ſwear by it, <hi>When we make a collation, and compariſon (as it were) betweene the truth of one thing, and another.</hi> As when <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan, As the Lord liveth, and as thy ſoule liveth, there is but a ſteppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene me and death,</hi> 1 Samuel 10. 3. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eli, O my Lord, as thy ſoule liveth, I am the woman that ſtood here praying,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 26. Thus <hi>Abner</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he asked him, Whoſe ſonne <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was? he anſwered, <hi>As thy ſoule liveth, O King, I cannot tell,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 55. In theſe places, they doe not ſweare by the ſoule of a man, but make a compariſon, as ſure as they live; which is plaine and manifeſt, ſo ſurely is ſuch a thing true. And in this ſenſe likewiſe ſome defend that Oath of the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>By the ſafety or life of the Emperour,</hi> if thereby they did not meane God himſelf; as <hi>David</hi> often calleth God, <hi>The health and light of his countenance,</hi> yea his <hi>life</hi> alſo. Now although in theſe reſpects a creature may be named lawfully, yet the latter way is not to be uſed by Chriſtians. For it is offenſive to godly eares, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is a wicked and moſt ungodly compariſon, which ſome men uſe, when they will ſay, <hi>Such a thing is as true, as God is true.</hi> For that is blaſphemy to compare a creature, and the infinite Majeſty of God together in matter of truth.</p>
               <p>In the third place, Concerning this Definition of an Oath, that is, <hi>A</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Whether it is lawfull to ſay, I vow 'tis ſo.</note> 
                  <hi>religious calling upon God;</hi> we may queſtion concerning ſome forme of ſpeeches, which are frequently uſed amongſt us, whether they be Oaths, or no. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, Many have this ordinary expreſſion, <hi>I vow to God it is ſo.</hi> Is this lawfull?</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Suarez</hi> anſwereth, <hi>(Disput. de Juramento)</hi> ſaying, <hi>That it is not onely an improper and abſurd ſpeech, but alſo very ungodly, and highly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>wicked.</hi> It is <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>abſurd,</hi> for it confounds a <hi>vow</hi> with an <hi>oath.</hi>
                  <pb n="665" facs="tcp:48709:345"/>
A <hi>vow</hi> is not properly uſed to confirme a thing, for that is the nature of an <hi>Oath.</hi> But if there were impropriety onely in it, that were not ſo hainous; but it is abominable irreverence, making ſuch things the object of a vow, which are light and triviall. And thereupon ſome conclude, There is more prophaneneſſe and irreverence in it, then in uſing an oath: yea (they ſay) it <hi>is a very great Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, The great Queſtion is, <hi>Whether theſe expreſſions (in faith)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Whether in faith, and by faith be oaths. <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and (by faith) are oaths, or not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I ſay,</p>
               <p>Firſt, When there is a doubt and diſpute, whether ſuch a forme of ſpeech be an <hi>Oath?</hi> then the ſafeſt way for thy conſcience, is to abſtaine from expreſſions, as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>(Romans</hi> 14.) <hi>Whatſoever is done doubting, is a ſinne.</hi> If then there be a diſpute, and that amongſt learned men, Whether <hi>in faith</hi> (for moſt grant <hi>by faith</hi> to be one) be an Oath? Is it not farre better for thee to leave off ſuch forme of words? If there were nothing but the ſcandall to others, it is a juſt cauſe to make thee avoid ſuch expreſſions: So that the diſputes about the thing, is argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to make thee leave theſe words, there being no neceſſity to uſe them.</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, leſt you might ſay, Perhaps they are ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians and Doctors of that ſtrictneſſe that may thinke <hi>in faith,</hi> to be <hi>Oaths:</hi> Even amongſt the Popiſh Authours, there are thoſe who judge ſo. Onely they diſtinguiſh about <hi>faith,</hi> What <hi>faith</hi> doe you meane (ſay they) when you ſay <hi>in faith?</hi> If the <hi>Chriſtian faith,</hi> that is a ſacred thing, and ſo it's an <hi>Oath;</hi> if a <hi>moral faith,</hi> that is nothing, but <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane veracity,</hi> or a <hi>civil faith,</hi> as we may call it, the faith of a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Gentleman; then (they ſay) it is no <hi>Oath.</hi> But who is there that ſaith <hi>in faith,</hi> doth conſider what faith he meaneth? Nay ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, if they were asked that Queſtion, could not tell how to anſwer it. Onely becauſe not onely men of the greater ranke, but of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſort, doe uſe that expreſſion, and becauſe they doe it for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation; it is to be preſumed, that they meane the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith;</hi> and if ſo, according to ſome Popiſh Authours, it is an <hi>Oath.</hi> Neither is that any thing conſiderable to ſay, we doe not uſe the Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>by;</hi> we doe not ſay <hi>by faith,</hi> but <hi>in faith;</hi> as <hi>Soto</hi> the Papiſt ſaith, To ſay <hi>by faith</hi> is an <hi>Oath,</hi> but not to ſay <hi>in faith.</hi> For <hi>Suarez</hi> an acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jeſuite ſaith, <hi>(Disp. de Juram.) That ſuch an exception is vaine;</hi> and <hi>that by faith,</hi> and <hi>in faith is all one.</hi> Neither doth the Prepoſition make an Oath. We conclude then, that <hi>in faith,</hi> as well as <hi>by faith,</hi> are Oaths. It's true, Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> opinion is, That <hi>in faith</hi> is no more, than an aſſeveration. Onely he addeth, <hi>We muſt abſtaine from the Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by.</hi> But (as I ſaid) <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> are all one, in this caſe. And if you ſay, Why ſhould <hi>in faith</hi> be more an Oath, than <hi>in deed,</hi> or <hi>in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> To this Doctor <hi>Sanderſon</hi> giveth a conſiderable anſwer, <hi>(De Juram. Praelect. 1. Sect.</hi> 8.) he maketh foure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or markes, by which we may diſcover ſome formes of ſpeech to be Oaths; and one of them is, <hi>The cuſtome and uſe of the Countreyes language, where we live.</hi> So that although it may fall out, that if we doe regard the words, there is no reaſon, why one ſhould be not an Oath, more than another, yet the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and uſe of the Countrey muſt carry it, becauſe words doe not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie naturally, but by meere inſtitution. So that as that may be money in one Countrey, which may not be in another: Thus that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſignifie an Oath, in one Countrey, which doth not in another.
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:48709:346"/>
We grant therefore, that if we doe reſpect the meere words, there is no argument can be given, why <hi>in deed</hi> ſhould not be an <hi>Oath,</hi> as well as <hi>in faith;</hi> but the cuſtome of ſpeech in this Land, at leaſt amongſt thoſe who are more ſober, and deſire to feare an Oath, is to judge of it as an Oath. And no doubt but thoſe that uſe it, doe for the moſt part intend ſo. Yea, why doe many uſe that expreſſion <hi>in faith,</hi> but becauſe they would not be thought too preciſe? For by this they would be diſtinguiſhed from others, who are more ſtrict. This is the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> (as it were) by which they would be notified.

               <p>THe definition of an <hi>oath</hi> being delivered, we now come to ſatisfie that party, which holdeth an <hi>oath</hi> is abſolutely unlawfull under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: as alſo to ſhew you, <hi>how it is lawfull, and when it is lawfull,</hi> that ſo common ſwearers may be aſhamed and confounded, to ſee what guilt they daily bring upon themſelves, and yet never lay it to heart. As for thoſe who have abſtained from an oath as <hi>unlawfull,</hi> we finde the ſect of <hi>Eſſen's</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews reckoned by learned men as remarkable. This ſect was at the ſame time with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> whoſe manners and way <hi>Joſephus</hi> relateth at large. yet (ſay ſome) our Saviour did not reprove their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe they lived ſolitary in places remote from Towns and commerce of men: <hi>Euſebius</hi> upon a miſtake doth ſuppoſe them to be Chriſtians. Now their opinion was, that <hi>it did not beſeem a man to ſwear.</hi> They thought a mans word ſhould be as firm as an oath, yet that they were not abſoluely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt <hi>ſwearing,</hi> appeareth in that they took an oath of every member ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their ſociety, to walk according to their rules. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> beſides their doctrinall hereſies, had two practicall Poſitions, which ſeemed to ſavour of much piety and religion. The one was, <hi>that a rich man abiding rich, couldnot be ſaved; whatſoever was above neceſſity he was bound to abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> The other was, that it is <hi>wholly unlawfull to ſwear upon any occaſion;</hi> and as for <hi>Pauls</hi> examples, they denied them to be <hi>oaths;</hi> and as for the inſtance taken from God himſelf, that he did ſwear, their anſwer was, that though God the Maſter might ſwear, yet it did not follow that ſervants might, eſpecially when their Maſter forbiddeth them. The Papiſts ſome of them, though they hold it lawfull <hi>to ſwear,</hi> yet they judge abſtinence from it a counſell belonging to perfect men, and not a precept. They uſually likewiſe charge it upon the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> as if they judged an Oath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unlawfull. The <hi>Socinians</hi> they indeed grant an Oath <hi>lawfull</hi> in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary caſes; only their errour is, <hi>That whereas raſh and vain ſwearing was not forbidden in the Old Teſtament; The Jews in their ordinary diſcourſe might ſwear, ſo only falſe ſwearing was prohibited:</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt as a more perfect Law-giver doth not only forbid forſwearing, but that common raſh ſwearing.</hi> But this is built upon their falſe foundation, <hi>That Chriſt perſected the morall Law,</hi> not by explication and declaration only, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Phariſaicall gloſſes, but by <hi>addition of new precepts.</hi> Some <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> in this latter age have poſitively condemned all Oaths, and therefore

Yea, ſome of the Fathers, as <hi>Tertullian, Baſil, Chryſoſtome,</hi> and others, do ſeem as peremptorily to condemn all kinde of ſwearing, as can be expreſſed; ſome of them thinking it was allowed the Jews no otherwiſe than he Bill of Divorce was, even for the hardneſſe of their hearts. There are indeed learned men, as <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> and others, who labour to excuſe them; but by their words nothing ſeemeth to be more plain: yet <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Qucmodo pejerare quibus ne jurare eſt licitum? how ſhall Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for ſwear, to whom it is not lawful to ſwear?</hi> acknowledgeth, that though the Chriſtians, as <hi>Polycarpus</hi> wou'd dye rather than ſwear <hi>per genium impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris,</hi> which they judged a devil; yet they did, <hi>per ſalutem imperatoris, by the life, or ſafety of the Emperour,</hi> or rather God the cauſe of it. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the thoughts of men might be, yet that in ſome urgent and neceſſary caſes it is lawfull, appeareth, <note place="margin">It is lawfull in ſome caſes to ſwear. <hi>Arg.</hi> 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>From the examples of it in Scripture, and that of God; of Angels, of godly and holy men; yea, of Chaiſt alſo,</hi> ſay ſome. That <hi>God did ſwear,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by many places in the Old Teſtament; and the Apoſtle improveth it for the comfort of the godly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 13. only his Oath is peculiar, as his Majeſty is infinite; for he ſweareth <hi>by himſelf,</hi> becauſe he hath <hi>no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſwear by.</hi> Some Learned men indeed have thought, that it is but an improper and metaphoricall expreſſion, when God is ſaid <hi>to ſwear,</hi> and that it is not truly <hi>an Oath,</hi> but the Apoſtle doth expreſly make his <hi>promiſe,</hi> and his <hi>Oath</hi> two things: Not that there is a need on Gods part, to confirm his word, but on our part, who are ſubject to evil. Therefore it is our evil, that maketh God to ſwear. In ſome of thoſe Oaths, there is an <hi>ellipſis,</hi> or <hi>defect;</hi> as <hi>Pſal. 95. 11. Unto whom I ſware in my wrath, if they ſhall enter into my reſt. If,</hi> ſome make the ſupply of this Oath to be by execration, then <hi>let me not be God;</hi> but others more probably make it only for a more vehement atteſtation, conceiving ſuch an <hi>execration</hi> undecent to the Majeſty of God; as alſo becauſe his infinite perfection is ſuch as is not capable of any ſuch execration. That Angels did ſwear, appeareth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 6. where one is ſaid <hi>to ſwear by him that liveth for ever.</hi> The eternity of God is the attribute there mentioned, becauſe of the fitneſſe of it to the matter in hand, the Angel declaring what would befall the Church in future ages: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not likely that Angels ſwear to one another for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing; for this was done to <hi>John,</hi> for confirmation of the things foretold. That Chriſt did ſwear, ſome affirm in that expreſſion, <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> but other Learned men judge not that to be an Oath: but though he did not, it muſt be granted, that he might, both becauſe as man he was capable of <hi>ſwearing</hi> as well as praying to God; and alſo hereby he might confirm the words that he ſaid, but his wonderfull miracles did abundantly eſtabliſh that; That holy men alſo have upon neceſſary occaſions taken an oath, appeareth by many examples of <hi>Paul.</hi> So that if our Saviour had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an abſolute prohibition of all Oaths, this Apoſtle would have often offended againſt that command. It is true we told you, that all Oaths ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſinne, therefore in the ſtate of integrity there would have been no oath; yet <hi>Suarez Diſput. de Juram.</hi> thinketh there might have been in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though not ſo often, becauſe many contingent things might have been known to one, which were not to another. Therefore he would have an Oath, not neceſſarily to ſuppoſe ſinne but leſſer perfection. It is not worth the while to contend in this. By theſe examples we ſee plainly <hi>the lawfulneſſe of ſwearing</hi> upon urgent occaſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="669" facs="tcp:48709:347"/>
The ſecond Argument <hi>is from the commands in the Old Teſtament,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note> 6. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 20. The third Commandement in forbidding all irreverent uſe of Gods Name, eſpecially in <hi>ſwearing,</hi> doth thereby command the lawfull and reverent uſe of his Name in Oaths; yea, there are promiſes of it under the Goſpel-time, not indeed that it is a duty commanded abſolutely, and for it ſelf ſake; ſo it's not commanded as prayer is, but upon ſuppoſition, where there is need: Thus in ſome difficult caſes, in contracts between men for purgation of themſelves, or diſcovering the truth, an oath is required, <hi>Num. 30, Lev. 5. 4. Num.</hi> 5. 19, 21.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Apoſtle is clear for this, <hi>Heb. 6. 16. For men verily ſwear by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them ahend of ſtrife:</hi> That doth not weaken the proof, becauſe he ſaith to men, as if he meant only the <hi>men of the world,</hi> they uſe ſuch a cuſtome, but Chriſtians do not; for one kinde of men is not there oppoſed to another; men of the world to beleevers, but men to God: Therefore you heard beleevers did ſwear, as <hi>Paul</hi> upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions. Thus <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did by an oath ſolemnly purge himſelf to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperour, that he had not ſpoken any thing againſt him to his brother <hi>Conſtans.</hi> Thus you have Scripture-ground for the lawfulneſſe of it: Neither doth any thing in reaſon, or the nature of an oath, make it unlawfull: yea, on the contrary God is thereby glorified, and the publike edified. For if you do regard the originall or riſe of an Oath, that is for the honour of God; it being introduced upon a faith, that God beholds all things, that he loveth truth, and will be a ſevere avenger of all thoſe who take his Name in vain. And then if you conſider the end of it, it is <hi>to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh righteouſneſſe between man and man;</hi> and ſo is a bond of humane ſociety: And if you ſay, there is this unfitneſſe in an Oath, becauſe a ſpiritual thing is ordained to that which is temporall, a ſuperiour for an inferiour, the worſhip of God to decide an humane buſineſſe. Becauſe therefore of the awe and reverence to an Oath, ſome though they have thought it lawfull to ſwear in ſacred things, wherein Gods honour is immediatly concerned, yet judge it unlawfull about many Controverſies, and ſuch humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. Hence <hi>Baſil. Homil, de legend. lib. Gent.</hi> commendeth <hi>Clinias</hi> a <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean,</hi> who being fined a very great ſumme of money, the paying whereof he might have eſcaped, by taking an oath, yet refuſed, and would rather ſuffer that great loſſe rather than take an oath. But the true anſwer is by diſtinguiſhing of the proxime and ultimate end, though an oath, which is a worſhip of God have for its proxime end a confirmation of ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall matter, yet the ultimate end is to glorifie God. Again, there may be this in reaſon againſt an Oath, that it ſeemeth to be a tempting of God, for <hi>can we make God witneſſe to a thing when we will?</hi> To this the anſwer is, that if the intention of the ſwearer in his oath ſhould be ſo, to call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he ſhould immediatly by ſome ſigne in a ſenſible manner demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate his notice thereof; This indeed would be to tempt God, though ſome times Gods judgements do immediatly and viſibly fall upon ſuch as take his Name in vain, or inviſibly by terrours and horrours of conſcience; but that is not, or ought not to be the ſcope of him that ſweareth, but thereby to commit the truth of God, who in his due time here or hereafter will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon ſuch as ſwear not aright. Well then, you will ſay, all this may be granted, but what ſhall we ſay to thoſe two places of Scripture, which ſeem as clearly to forbid all oaths at any time, as clearly, as can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 33, 34. &amp;c. <hi>But I ſay unto you, Swear not at all,</hi> &amp;c. where firſt our Saviour doth univerſally prohibit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>at no time, in no thing,</hi> as it might ſeem. 2. He ſaith, <hi>Let your yea be yea; and nay, nay:</hi>
                  <pb n="670" facs="tcp:48709:348"/>
that is, uſe no more than a bare affirmation, without calling God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And laſtly, he addeth, <hi>Whatſoever is more, is of ſinne.</hi> Now if you compare the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> who alludeth to this of our Saviour, he ſpeaketh more poſitively, <hi>Jam. 5. 12. Above all things, my brethren, ſwear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath, loſt you might think:</hi> He forbiddeth ſwearing by creatures, he addeth, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any other oath, leſt ye fall into condemnation;</hi> or as <hi>Grotius,</hi> who ſheweth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is uſed for <hi>falſhood</hi> and <hi>a lye</hi> left by ſwearing you come to forſwearing. Thus you ſee how fairly theſe Texts ſeem to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it againſt any kinde of ſwearing; and by this private Chriſtians are to be admoniſhed, to compare one place of Scripture with another, and <hi>panciora per plura;</hi> for the minding of ſome Texts only, not comparing them with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath cauſed much errour. As in the doctrine of <hi>Univerſall Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> becauſe ſome places ſay, <hi>Chriſt dyed for all,</hi> they runne away with them, not conſidering other places which do reſtrain them, and ſhew in what ſenſe that <hi>Univerſality</hi> is to be underſtood: So becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all, nor by any other oath,</hi> therefore they conclude, that <hi>no ſwearing is lawfull,</hi> And how guilty then muſt <hi>Paul</hi> be, who yet bid us <hi>follow him as he did Chriſt,</hi> for he ſweareth often? It is certain then, that our Saviour Chriſt doth not forbid <hi>ſwearing</hi> in the generall, for he ſaith at that time, <hi>he came not to deſtroy the Law,</hi> and ſwearing was lawfull in the Old Teſtament: But the Phariſaicall opinions and gloſſes for they had brought in corrupt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it was lawfull to ſwear by creatures as well as God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If a man did ſwear by creatures and not by God, he was not guilty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, if he did not fullfill it.</hi> Our Saviour therefore doth expreſly condemn both theſe. This is the ſumme of this Prohibition, <hi>We are not to ſwear by creatures,</hi> but yet if we do, becauſe they relate to God, it is by interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if we did ſwear by God himſelf: <hi>Grotius</hi> indeed thinketh, that this place, with that of <hi>James,</hi> is to be underſtood of <hi>promiſſory oaths:</hi> and <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelius</hi> the Socinian, he ſeemeth to ſay, <hi>That though this place may not forbid all aſſertory oaths, when neceſſity requireth, yet promiſſory oaths are not allowable, when the thing is not certain, and it may not be in our power to fullfill it.</hi> But the Texts comprehend both. It is true, Learned Interpreters go contrary waies, though they both meet in the end. For ſome ſay, Our Saviour doth not forbid <hi>all oaths, but all oaths by creatures;</hi> and ſome make the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not to relate to <hi>ſwearing,</hi> but the words following, <hi>Neither by heaven or earth,</hi> as if it were a diſtribution of that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. In this ſence, <hi>the ſwearing not at all,</hi> or <hi>no other oath,</hi> is to be limited to creatures, <hi>not at all</hi> by the creatures, not any oath by them; he doth not forbid us to ſwear by God in juſt cauſes, or before a Magiſtrate, but by the creatures, and that in our ordinary diſcourſe. For the <hi>Jews</hi> did not think it lawfull to ſwear by any thing but God, in their ſolemn Judicatories. Thus it is like that univerſall <hi>All; Whatſoever they bid you obſerve, do,</hi> Matth. 23. 3. that is, <hi>all lawfull things:</hi> So when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I became all things to all men,</hi> that is, in <hi>things lawful and indifferent;</hi> he did not become an Idolater: Others they grant, that our Saviour forbiddeth all oaths, as well thoſe <hi>by God as by the creatures,</hi> becauſe he giveth this reaſon, <hi>That whoſoever ſweareth by the creatures ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by God in effect;</hi> and then they ſay, the meaning is, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> that is, <hi>in unneceſſary and cauſeleſſe matters.</hi> The <hi>ſwearing</hi> is not ſo much forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as the frequent and unnceceſſary uſe of it. As much as lieth in you, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and this is every mans duty.</p>

Thus we have briefly vindicated that Text. In the next place, how may we ſwear lawfully? And in this the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> informeth us of three ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <note place="margin">How we may ſwear law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</note> concomitants of every oath, which all Writers almoſt upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject take notice of, <hi>Jer. 4. 3.

From what hath been delivered concerning an Oath, I proceed to an Uſe of ſevere Reproof againſt that common Epidemicall ſinne of ordinary ſwearing. It is a Nationall ſinne; it is the City-ſinne, it is the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage-ſinne, it is the Family-ſinne, it is the rich mans ſinne, the poor mans ſinne, the old mans ſin, the young mans; yea, the childs ſin, who learneth to ſpeak and ſwear together.

<pb n="673" facs="tcp:48709:349"/>
that if it be but once an unlawfull ſwearing in all thy life, thou haſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this command; and as one tile of the houſe neglected, may in time make the whole covering conſume; and one rent in the garment let alone, may at laſt deſtroy the whole: ſo even one ſinfull oath not repented of or humbled for, may bring on the damnation of the whole man. You ſee this command is laid down ſo ſtrictly both in the negative and affirmative part, that ſome have jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it wholly unlawful to ſwear in any caſe; but that you heard was an error on the right hand: yet ſo farre the command extendeth, as to forbid all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary, idle, raſh, and unneceſſary ſwearing. So that the common ſwearer may as much fear to come near this command, as the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> did to the mount, when the Law was given. Shall not this command of Chriſt be more to thee than all cuſtome and example? But <hi>I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> who dareth then thus contradict Chriſt? Why doſt thou not all the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long minde thy ſelf of this? Why doth not thy conſcience put thee in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this command? Say, when thou riſeſt, when thou walkeſt, when thou goeſt to bed, this commandment to thy ſelf, <hi>Swear not.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> alſo becauſe of the great neceſſity and utility of this precept doth repeat it to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. For as <hi>Luthers</hi> ſaying is, <hi>principum literae ſunt bis vel ter legendae, Princes letters and commands are to be read twice or thrice.</hi> And thus we are daily to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on this duty: by this gemination, it ſhould appear, that the heart of man is very ready to break out into this filthy prophaneneſſe, though there be no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring motive: Therefore he addeth, <hi>Above all things, my brethren, Swear not; above all things</hi> look to your tongue, ſet a watch before your lips, that you be not found guilty of this ſinne. And whereas the Apoſtle in the Verſes following is to deſcribe the ſuitable and particular duties to a man afflicted, and to a man merry, he doth ſeem to remove this ſin of ſwearing in the firſt place, prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that; for experience telleth us, that when men either are ſadly afflicted, and in diſcontents, or joyful and merry, then they are moſt prone to forget themſelves, and fall into this ſinne of <hi>ſwearing:</hi> therefore the Apoſtle by way of caution, ſaith, <hi>above all things ſwear not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond motive againſt this common ſin of ſwearing, is <hi>from the character</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. A godly man is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be one fearing an oath.</note> 
                  <hi>and deſcription that is given of a godly man in this very particular; he is one that feareth an oath:</hi> he dare not ſwear in his ordinary diſcourſe, and in unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſions. Therefore it is a preſumptuous thing in thee to flatter thy ſelf, that though thou falleſt into this ſinne now and then, yet thou haſt a good heart, and hopeſt that thou ſhalt do as well as the moſt preciſe, whom thou ſlandereſt with that ordinary calumny, that though they will not ſwear, yet they will lye; whereas a godly man hateth both the one and the other. But to our purpoſe: Let a man pretend never ſo much devotion, let him be never ſo confident of his good heart: yet if an ordinary <hi>ſwearer,</hi> thou canſt not have a principle of grace in thee. For <hi>Solomon</hi> making an oppoſition between a <hi>godly man</hi> and <hi>a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> deſcribing them by contrary characters, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 2. concludeth with this, <hi>he that ſweareth, and he that feareth an oath:</hi> So that a common ſwearer is the ſame with a wicked man and an unclean man: but then the godly man is deciphered by this, that <hi>he feareth an oath:</hi> obſerve that he doth not ſay, <hi>he that ſwsareth not, but he that feareth an oath.</hi> So that a gracious man doth not only abſtain from all cuſtomary ſwearing, but he hath an awe and a reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall fear in his ſoul about it; ſo that the prophane ſwearer is directly oppoſite to this character. The Pſalmiſt likewiſe, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 24. 4. when he had propounded this Queſtion, <hi>who ſhall aſcend to the holy hill of God, and ſtand in his holy place?</hi> that is, who is a true member of the Church of God? he anſwereth by giving ſeverall properties of ſuch; two whereof are, <hi>He who hath not lift up his ſoul to vanity, nor ſworn deceitfully.</hi> By <hi>lifting up the ſoul to vanity,</hi> ſome learned men underſtand <hi>vain ſwearing;</hi> and then followeth another and greater ſinne,
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:48709:350"/>
which is <hi>perjury and falſe ſwearing,</hi> which commonly followeth upon the frequent uſe of the former ſinne.</p>
               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> motive is, <hi>From the nature of the ſin, it is a very hainous and grievous ſin.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It is a great ſinne.</note> For this is a rule, all ſins againſt the firſt Table, are more hainous than thoſe againſt the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> becauſe they are immediatly againſt God; theſe againſt our neighbour; &amp; ſo by conſequence againſt God. Though therfore <hi>oaths</hi> fall frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thy mouth, without any fear and trembling, yet they are ſins of a bloody nature, as appeareth from the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Commandment, <hi>thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.</hi> It's Gods Name who is infinite in Majeſty, who is to be named alwaies with a holy fear and reverence, and ſhalt thou pollute it in thy wicked mouth? This Commandment doth not only forbid ordinary <hi>ſwearing,</hi> but all light and irreverent uſing of Gods Name; as you have many will ſay, <hi>O God, O Lord,</hi> and <hi>O Jeſus:</hi> theſe are great ſins, though thou doſt not tremble under them. Let the common <hi>ſwearer</hi> then know, that his ſin is a very hainous one, he contemneth the glory and worſhip of God. Obſerve that expreſſion, <hi>Deut. 28. 58. that thou maiſt fear this glorious and fearfull Name, the Lord thy God.</hi> Do not then flatter thy ſelf, make not this common ſwearing a light ſinne, for ſins are weighty, according as God judgeth of them, and this he accounteth an immediate contempt of his Majeſty. You would not make uſe of the name of a great man to witneſſe every bable and trifle. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Common ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſhew more reſpect to their new garments, than they do to Gods Name; for they will not wear them but upon ſolemn occaſions.</hi> Whereas theſe in every trifle, and upon every paſſion, do highly diſhouour God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>As the ſin of common ſwearing is grievous in its nature, ſo it's threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a ſpeciall manner with more than ordinary judgements.</hi> Even in this life God <note place="margin">4. It hath very great judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt it.</note> many times doth puniſh remarkably the common ſwearer: Hence in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the threatning is added, <hi>the Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe that taketh his Name in vain.</hi> It is a figure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, leſſe is ſaid, and more is intended, that is, <hi>he will certainly deal with ſuch a man as a guilty perſon, he ſhall find that ſin doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God in an high manner.</hi> The Apoſtle likewiſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. when he had prohibited <hi>ſwearing,</hi> addeth, <hi>leſt ye fall into condemnation;</hi> the judgement of God lyeth at thy door, and will finde thee out. The place alſo formerly mentioned, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 2, 3. is very dreadfull. There is a <hi>flying roll,</hi> full of curſes, and it is ſaid <hi>to go into the houſe of the ſwearer, and to continue in the midſt of his houſe, till it hath conſumed all.</hi> The <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Greek Expoſitors for a flying roll</hi> reade a <hi>flying hatchet,</hi> taking <hi>maggall</hi> for <hi>megillah;</hi> howſoever it is as terrible, as if an Angel ſhould come with an hatchet, and cut down ſuch a mans houſe. <hi>It's fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> therefore it cometh from heaven, and ſo all thy power cannot withſtand it: and then it's very <hi>broad and long,</hi> it will meet with every <hi>ſwearer:</hi> and then it is an <hi>utter conſumption,</hi> God will make him ſuch an example, that all who go by, ſhall ſay, <hi>here lived ſuch a prophane ſwearer:</hi> and ſee what miſery and ruine he and his are brought to. <hi>Suarez</hi> ſpeaketh of a prophane blaſphemous Proverb, that the Spaniards have to excuſe their common oaths, <hi>Qui bene jurat</hi> (by <hi>bene</hi> is meant <hi>multum) benè credit, he that ſweareth much, beleeveth well.</hi> It is a ſigne <hi>he beleeveth there is a God.</hi> And indeed an Atheiſt cannot <hi>ſwear</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unleſſe it be by deriſion; but that proverb hath blaſphemy in it, becauſe the ſwearer diſcovereth faith in God raſhly, and irreverently: Neither doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in his common diſcourſe to profeſſe faith in God, when he doth ſwear.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>This ſin of ſwearing is of ſo great a guilt that it polluteth a land, it bringeth publique judgements</hi> as well as private. Now all thoſe ſins that make <note place="margin">5. It pollutes a nation, and brings Gods judgements upon it.</note> the publique obnoxious to Gods judgements, are ſins of a groſſe nature, <hi>Jer. 23. 10. becauſe of ſwearing the land mourneth:</hi> and <hi>Hoſ. 4. 2. for ſwearing and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore the Lord had a controverſie with the land.</hi> Thus you ſee <hi>ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi>
                  <pb n="675" facs="tcp:48709:350"/>
are like <hi>Jonahs</hi> in a Ship, they bring the Tempeſts of Gods wrath upon the Land; only when Magiſtrates make good and ſevere Laws againſt ſwearing, and the under-Officers are diligent in execution (for good laws without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution are like a Bell without a clapper, as one ſaid) then the guilt is taken off the land. And therefore it would be cruelty to the Nation, to ſpare a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon; you are unwilling to make the ſwearer mourn, and thereby you make the land mourn. Therefore let juſtice be executed upon ſwearers, that ſo the nation may not incur Gods diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This ſin or common and irreverent ſwearing is <hi>condemned by the very</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the light of nature</note> 
                  <hi>light of nature.</hi> Heathens as the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> have thought it a reproach to a man to ſwear; his word ſhould be as good as an oath. It is noted of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that <hi>he did never ſwear,</hi> and therefore judged by the Heathens moſt religious. The more inexcuſable are thoſe Chriſtians, of whom <hi>Hierom</hi> complaineth, that would uſe thoſe Latine Oaths, <hi>mehercule, medius fidius. Plutarch</hi> reports, that when ſome were to ſwear among the heathens, they took them out of the houſe, and made them ſwear in the open air; one reaſon whereof was to make them deliberating, and conſidering before they did ſo. Will not theſe heathens riſe up in judgement againſt our common ſwearers, who yet glory in this Title of Chriſtianity? But let us hear their excuſes and cavils, ſuch ſwearers uſe to make.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſay, <hi>It's a cuſtome they have got, and they cannot leave it.</hi> But 1. the <note place="margin">The excuſes and cavils for ſwearing anſwered.</note> more deſperate and incurable is thy diſeaſe; the more a ſinne is habituated, the worſe it is; This is not an excuſe but an aggravation. Doth a cuſtome in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe or uncleanneſſe, alienate, and not rather inhance? And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why may not this cuſtome be left? Of all cuſtomes we might think this might be parted with moſt eaſily; for (as you heard) here is no profit or pleaſure to tempt thee. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> anſwering this very cavill, ſaith, <hi>That many who have had a cuſtome to ſtammer, have yet by diligence left it; yea,</hi> he ſpeaketh of one who <hi>had a cuſtome of lifting up one ſhoulder higher than another,</hi> that by naked ſwords upon the place to cut him, if he ſhould do ſo any more, did thereby leave that ill uſe; and may not this cuſtome of ſwearing be parted with upon eaſier terms? <hi>Bid thy Wife tell thee of it, thy children, thy ſervants;</hi> ſaith the ſame Ancient: and then at laſt, <hi>as many joyning together, do ſo ſtop a beaſt that they catch him,</hi> thus (ſaith he) <hi>they will at last we ary thee out of this cuſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, <hi>Many do ſo,</hi> even <hi>all generally</hi> (except ſome few Preciſians) <hi>do ſwear, and why ſhould not I do as moſt do?</hi> But to anſwer this, the command is clear, <hi>thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> Exo. 23. 2. Moſt men go in the broad way to hell, moſt men will be damned, and therefore this is no plea. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we are not to live by examples, but by precepts. What though all uſe to ſwear that live by thee? yet the command of Chriſt is to be more than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, even of holy men and Angels themſelves; much more then of wicked and ungodly men.</p>
               <p>In the third place, <hi>I think no hurt, I do no body any wrong.</hi> But 1. there is no man that ſinneth, intendeth to ſinne, the will of man cannot be carried out to will evil as it is evil; and ſo every ſinner might excuſe himſelf. Again, if thy oaths do not hurt others, yet they do thy own ſoul, thou art a murderer of that; and as much as lieth in thee, thou hurteſt God, robbing him of the glory due to him. And laſtly, thou doſt hurt others, for if a father, thy children learn to ſwear from thee; if a Maſter, thy ſervants do; or thy neighbours are encouraged, and the godly they are grieved at it.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place, Some pleade, <hi>they ſweare but ſometimes, it is when they are in a paſſion, when they are provoked.</hi> But, 1. <hi>Once is too much,</hi> any ſinne once committed is enough to damne for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>It is in thy paſſion,</hi> that will not
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:48709:351"/>
excuſe; if thou killeſt a man in thy paſſion, doth that free thee before God? The ſtronger thy paſſions are, the weaker thou art in grace, yea, in reaſon: Therefore thy condition is the more dangerous, becauſe ſo eaſily moved into paſſion; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grievous ſins are ſometimes committed in <hi>paſſion,</hi> which may make thee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and mourn all thy life long. Again, art thou in a paſſion? therefore the more unfit to take the Name of God in thy mouth, the greater thy irreverence, by how much more violent the paſſion is.</p>
               <p>In the fifth place, <hi>But when I have ſworn in my paſſion, and do recall my ſelf, I am ſorry for it, and ask God forgiveneſſe.</hi> But 1. ſeeing the ſin of irreverent ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is a very grievous ſin, committed immediatly againſt the Majeſty of God: it is not <hi>an ordinary confeſſion, a tranſient [Lord have mercy upon me] that can be accounted repentance in this caſe:</hi> There muſt be a ſerious and ſolemn ſetting of our ſelvs to humiliation for ſins of this nature. And 2. if ye be ſo ſorrowfull as never to fall into ſuch paſſionate ſwearing again, then it is good: but upon the very next provocation, the next paſſion, you fall a curſing and ſwearing again, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo that it is plain thou haſt not repented. Thou ſinneſt, and then askeſt God forgiveneſſe, and then thou ſinneſt again: what is this but to play the hypocrite with God, and to mock him.</p>
               <p>In the ſixth place, ſay ſome, <hi>I would not ſwear, but they will not beleeve me elſe.</hi> To this it is anſwered, happily it is thy fault, they do not think thee a man of truth and honeſty; if they did, thy bare word would be enough: and in the next place, who will beleeve thee the more for thy ordinary <hi>ſwearing?</hi> they think it is ſo common with thee, that thou doſt not matter it; and withall, he that is not afraid to diſhonour God, I cannot beleeve him though he ſhould ſwear a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand oaths: and indeed who doth regard the word and ſpeeches of a common ſwearer that is wiſe and prudent?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Some excuſe themſeves, <hi>That they are but petty oaths, they do not take Gods Name in vain; their oaths are petty oaths, by their faith and troth; and is that ſuch an offence?</hi> To anſwer this, 1. there is no <hi>petty oath,</hi> no more than a <hi>petty God,</hi> or a <hi>petty damnation.</hi> And 2. While you think to honour God, you diſhonour him; out of reverence you will not ſwear by him, but by a creature; this is more highly to offend him, while you give that which is due to him, to a creature. And therefore 3. here is not only <hi>unlawful ſwearing</hi> in thoſe oaths, but <hi>idolatry</hi> alſo. Is <hi>your faith a God? Is your troth a God? Is your faith</hi> an alſeeing witneſſe? Can that damn thee, if thou ſwear falſly? Therefore in theſe oaths you do not only ſin, but commit idolatry alſo.</p>

               <p>THe next thing to be conſidered in this Text, is the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Oath,</hi> which is indeed a full anſwer to the calumny charged upon him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. about his lightneſſe and inconſtancy in altering of his purpoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his coming to them. In this he ſheweth the true reaſon, that there was no fault in him; but the blame that was, was to be laid at their doors; they were not prepared, and fitted for his coming; therefore he ſaith, <hi>To ſpare you, I did not yet come to Corinth.</hi> It was not then any mutability or carnal principles that moved him herein; but a prudent and mercifull ordering of his coming to them, for their ſpiritual good. Should he have viſited them according to his promiſe, he would have come with a rod, and not in the ſpirit of meekneſſe, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 21. and ſo his preſence would have been very ungratefull, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he forbeareth a while, to ſee whether his former Epiſtle might work a full humiliation and reformation amongſt them, being unwilling to proceed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more ſevere cenſures.

But you will ſay, This ſeemeth to be no good reaſon. For if <hi>Paul</hi> had gone to <hi>Corinth,</hi> he might have <hi>ſpared them:</hi> howſoever <hi>Paul</hi> ſurely did not fear his paſſions would prevail over his judgement, or his zeal devour his prudence.

and the godly who deſired godly order in the Church would have been diſcouraged. Therefore to prevent this neceſſary ſeverity, he doth in this Epiſtle, as in the former, admoniſh them, and warn them; ſo that if poſſible, they might of themſelves reforme, and ſo prevent the exerciſe of his power amongſt them.

                  <note place="margin">Miniſterial power ought to be managed with much holy prudence and commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> 
                  <hi>ought to be managed with much holy prudence and commiſeration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The end of their power is alwayes to be in their minde; which is <hi>edification,</hi> and ſo are accordingly to uſe means proportionably thereunto, leſt in ſtead of <hi>edification</hi> there be <hi>deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That God hath given the Miniſters of his Goſpel an eccleſiaſtical or Church-power, as alſo what the nature of it is, the acts and exerciſe of it; as alſo the objects to whom it extends, I ſhall here take for granted; there will be a more ſeaſonable occaſion to treat of theſe things in ſome enſuing paſſages of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. I ſhall only at this time briefly ſpeak to this particular manner of <hi>mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> it, which is ſpecified in the Text; and that is, <hi>with holy prudence and pity,</hi> with much long-ſuffering and meekneſſe. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>When we call it an holy prudence and moderation; let us conſider what is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. What is meant by holy prudence. 1. Hereby is excluded all wordly policy.</note> 
                  <hi>meant hereby.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>We exclude carnal craft, and worldly policy.</hi> When men make uſe of Church-power, and the Ordinances of Chriſt onely for carnal ends, and to advance themſelves and their party thereby. It was farre from <hi>Paul</hi> to make uſe of any ſuch prophane policy; therefore he often proclaimeth the integrity of his heart and intentions, that he was not in the number of thoſe, <hi>who did corrupt the word of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> Chap. 3. 2. he there renounceth the <hi>hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſſe,—but commending our ſelves to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi> So that there is a vaſt difference between godly prudence, which ſtudieth to uſe the choiſeſt meanes, and moſt fit for the ſpiritual good of others, and a crafty politick way, indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men in their luſts, that ſo they may obtain their corrupt intentions. Our Saviour ſpeaketh very notably, when he ſaith, <hi>(Luke 16. 8.) The children of this world are wiſer in their generation, than the children of light.</hi> Though they be light, yet they have not that ſubtil eye-ſight in the things of the world; but yet do farre ſurpaſſe the greateſt <hi>Ahitophel</hi> in the world in ſpiritual things: crafty and worldly wiſe men, are like the owls that ſee beſt in the dark; but when the Sunne ſhineth, then their eyes are dazelled. Thus ſuch men in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affairs, in evil contrivements, are very ſubtil, but as dull as ſtocks and ſtones in any heavenly things. Let not then any under this pretence of holy prudence in Church-power, encourage himſelf in carnal and worldly craftineſſe: the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is juſtly branded for this. For in antiquity, when any Church had excommunicated ſome for their prophaneneſſe and ill demeanours, who appealing to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for redreſſe, hereby to advance their power, they would encourage ſuch, and maintain them againſt thoſe Church-officers who had caſt them out. This carnal craft and ungodly policy, is uſed by too many Officers in the Church, that contemn Chriſts order, that deſpiſe
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:48709:352"/>
all wholſome means to true piety, that thereby they may ſatisfie their earthly ends. It is true, when the faithfull Miniſters of Chriſt do effectually move for the purity of Ordinances, and the promoting of godlineſſe among their people, there are thoſe who will maliciouſly traduce them for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſelfe-ſeeking ends, as if they proceeded wholly upon ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and policy, but the ſearcher of hearts witneſſeth to their ſincerity, and ſo they comfortably proceed in Chriſts worke, maugre all oppoſition. It's <hi>holy prudence</hi> then, not <hi>carnal policy,</hi> which muſt manage miniſterial power.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>When we require holy prudence and meekneſſe, we do not hereby</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Zeal is not excluded.</note> 
                  <hi>exclude zeal;</hi> as if a man ſhould not with much fervency and ardour of ſpirit ſet himſelf for the truth of God, as alſo againſt the kingdome of ſinne and Satan. No, it cannot be heavenly prudence, unleſſe it be accompanied with this <hi>zeale.</hi> As <hi>zeale</hi> muſt be with knowledge and diſcretion; ſo muſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be with <hi>zeale.</hi> They muſt be as <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> alwayes appearing together, which was repreſented in the Sacrifice, which was to have ſalt, as well as fire. Thus <hi>(Rom. 12.) We are to be fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> And it is the Lord Chriſt, who ſaid, <hi>The zeale of thy houſe hath eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me up,</hi> Joh. 12. 17. Here is a notable example for all godly Miniſters. The zeale for Gods glory, is even to conſume them (as it were) as the fat of the Sacrifice was burnt in the fire to the Lord: to which ſome think our Saviour doth allude in that expreſſion. We are to come in the ſpirit of <hi>Elijah,</hi> even to be carried in a fiery Chariot. And truly without this zeale for God, a man is but a lump of earth. It is true, we muſt diſtinguiſh <hi>holy zeale</hi> from our owne <hi>paſſions,</hi> and <hi>cholerick distempers,</hi> but that which is the pure fire of Gods Spirit kindled in our hearts, as it doth greatly conduce to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo it doth exceedingly tend to our own comfort. Let therefore thoſe be magnified for wiſe and moderate men; let them be admired, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Angels, that live in a lukewarm and neutral way; they will reprove no ſinne; they will provoke no man to frowne upon them; but (alas) the iſſue will diſcover their folly. Oh the throbs and pangs of conſcience ſome have had, when going out of the world, for this very particular, becauſe they did not with more zeale and forwardneſſe appear for God. And on the other ſide, that Miniſter who hath with faithfull zeale, according to the words direction, behaved himſelf in his miniſterial labours, though great ones have frowned at him, though malicious people have vexed him, yet he dieth full of comfort. For they that are filled with the Spirit of God by zeal in their life time, are many times filled with heavenly conſolations in their death.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>This holy prudence, is not to be confounded with that ſinfull man-pleaſing,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It is not to be confounded with man-pleaſing.</note> 
                  <hi>which is in many, indulging men in their luſts, and hardening them thereby in their impieties.</hi> Though the Apoſtle ſaid, 1 <hi>Corinth. 10. 33. That he pleaſed all men, in all things, not ſeeking his owne profit;</hi> yet that is not to be underſtood in ſinfull things; for in that reſpect he ſaith, <hi>Galat. 1. 10. If he pleaſed men, he ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt;</hi> but in lawfull things he did condeſcend to thoſe that were weak, and would not alwayes uſe his own liberty, which he might, being ſtrong in judgement; but this doth nothing advantage ſuch who have a flattering, complying way with men in their wickedneſſe, like thoſe falſe prophets of old, that daubed with untempered mortar, and cryed <hi>Peace, peace to him,</hi> whom God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed no peace. This is highly offending God. Yet how many are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe they have the love of wicked and ungodly men, that they can keepe in with them? Whereas this is not, becauſe they have large
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:48709:353"/>
parts, but a large conſcience; and that which ſome make to be a very wiſe man, is indeed to be a man without any conſcience. But I muſt not enlarge in this.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place therefore we are to ſhew, <hi>Wherein this holy prudence doth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wherein holy prudence doth conſiſt. 1. In diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our love to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be the ground of all our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> 
                  <hi>conſiſt.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In diſcovering our love to their perſons, to be the ground of all our proceedings.</hi> If we reprove them, it is love; if we admoniſh them, it is love; if we do not admit them to the dreadfull myſteries of Chriſt, it is love. <hi>Dilige &amp; loquere quod vis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin; Love, and then ſay what ye will.</hi> This made the Apoſtle uſe a ſacred oath at this time, to ſhew it was his love to them, and no ſinfull end, that made him forbear his coming; ſo great a matter is it to be perſwaded that what the Miniſters of the Goſpel doe, though it diſtaſte and diſpleaſe us, yet it is out of their conſcience to God, and love to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Holy prudence lieth in this, when we obſerve the fit ſeaſons and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. In obſerving the fitteſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the exerciſe of power.</note> 
                  <hi>opportunities for exerciſing our power, which God hath given us;</hi> otherwiſe if <hi>unſeaſonably</hi> adminiſtred, it may doe more hurt than good. It is ſpecial prudence to time it well; in this ſenſe it is good to be a <hi>time-ſerver,</hi> as ſome read that paſſage, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. applying it to this ſenſe. <hi>Abigail</hi> would not ſpeak to her husband in his drunken ſenſleſſe fit, <hi>Iſai. 50. 4. The tongue of the learned is to ſpeake a word in ſeaſon;</hi> though that be chiefly to be applied, to a word of comfort, yet a word of reproof in ſeaſon, doth more good than ten thouſand unſeaſonably ſpoken. Such a word ſo ſpoken, is ſaid to be <hi>like Apples of gold in pictures of ſilver,</hi> Prov. 25. 11. wherein is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed both preciouſneſſe and excellency, as alſo delight and refreſhment. A <hi>fit word,</hi> is called in the Hebrew, <hi>A word upon the wheeles</hi> (as ſome thinke) becauſe of the ſmoothneſſe and readineſſe of it to enter into the hearts of others. Some render it, <hi>A word with its two faces,</hi> as looking on both ſides, which is the property of prudence: and the next verſe following ſheweth how happy it is, when a wiſe reproof, and an obedient ear meet together; ſuch an obedient ear is more comely and glorious, than any ear-jewel. As then the Bee doth not every day, but in fit ſeaſons gather its honey; ſo doth a prudent Miniſter of the Goſpel. Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 9, 10. <hi>Becauſe the preacher was wiſe, he ſought out acceptable words.</hi> Some trees that bloſſome laſt, are yet ſaid to have their fruit firſt; which ſheweth, that it is not the firſt or ſudden ſpeaking, but the moſt opportune, that doth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good; eſpecially in reproof this is moſt neceſſary, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Genus quoddam Martyrii eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is a kinde of Martyrdome to take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof patiently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Our prudence is ſeene, when we diſcerne of ſinnes, not judging</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of ſins.</note> 
                  <hi>little and great alike.</hi> To excommunicate for leſſer faults, is (ſaith <hi>Gerſon) To ſtrike off a flie from a mans fore-head with a beetle.</hi> The remedy is more dangerous than the diſeaſe. They were groſſe ſinnes that the Apoſtle is thus zealous againſt in the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Again, great ſinnes are to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether perſonal in ſome few, or publick and over-ſpreading all. For when ſinne hath infected a multitude, though it be a Miniſters duty to bring them out of ſuch an epidemical diſeaſe, and to withſtand the torrent of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, wherein God many times giveth unexpected and wonderfull ſucceſſe, as appeareth in <hi>Luther,</hi> to whom one ſaid, <hi>Abi in cellam, &amp; dic miſerere mei Domine,</hi> thinking it in vain to ſtirre, though God vouchſafed unexpected effects to his labours, yet we are with more prudence to endeavour the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a multitude, and not to be overhaſty, leſt we hinder that good which otherwiſe might be done. This was <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s knowne counſell to a
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:48709:353"/>
Biſhop, who deſired his advice about the ſinne of drunkenneſſe, which was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in all, he adviſeth him to proceed by degrees, and <hi>Monendo magis quam minando,</hi> &amp;c. But the next Chapter may give occaſion to greater enlargement in this point.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Prudence is ſeene about the order of the meanes which God hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. In the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of means.</note> 
                  <hi>appointed to reclaime others.</hi> In private or perſonal ſinnes, that is a golden ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e full of wiſdome, which our Saviour preſcribeth, <hi>Matth. 18. 15, 16, &amp;c.</hi> To deale with ſuch an offending brother firſt <hi>alone,</hi> and as we finde him obſtinate, ſo to proceed to a more publick way. To give <hi>Ellebore</hi> or <hi>Opium</hi> at firſt, is too violent a remedy; ſuch that do ſo, are no wiſe Phyſicians to mens ſouls.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>It's a ſpecial part of prudence in our reproof of others, or other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtfull</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. In the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of due praiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>exerciſes to fleſh and blood, to mingle a due praiſe, for what is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good in them.</hi> To acknowledge any gift that God hath beſtowed upon them, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth often, joyning himſelf with other believers, ſometimes as if they were not inferiour to him; he doth not only uſe loving compellations of <hi>brethren</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> but alſo doth with much ſympathy take their infirmities and ſins as it were upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Holy prudence doth not onely make a Miniſter looke to the good that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. In looking to the evil as well as the good that may come.</note> 
                  <hi>may come, but the evil alſo that may probably iſſue.</hi> For although our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be done, though the world ſhall fall upon our heads, yet we muſt conſider, whether when ſo many evils are in great probability attending the action, whether it be a duty then, or no. It's a known paſſage of one <hi>Audas</hi> a Biſhop, who out of great zeale, ſet a <hi>Perſian</hi> Temple on fire, wherein they worſhipped <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>fire,</hi> as a <hi>god,</hi> which did ſo enrage the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, that he commanded the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to build the Temple againe, or elſe he would put him to death. But the Biſhop refuſing, not onely he himſelf ſuffered, but thereby brought a moſt cruell perſecution upon many Chriſtians. Now this fact is juſtly condemned, as a moſt indiſcreet and raſh action; he did not conſider what evil would fall upon it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Sozomene</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>That he condemned his indiſcretion that he demoliſhed the Temple, but admired his zeale and conſtancy, that he would die rather than build it up againe.</hi> Many good actions ſeeming full of zeale, for want of a due conſideration, have brought more evil, than done good: yea have increaſed that evil the more, which they have endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh. Hence our Saviour giveth us wiſe counſel, <hi>Matth. 7. 6. Give not that which is holy unto the doggs, nor caſt ye your pearles before ſwine, leſt they trample them under feet, and turne againe and rent ye.</hi> Many times both the pearle, and the Miniſter alſo, at leaſt the exerciſe of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is deſtroyed, becauſe he did not conſider that ſome perſons are ſwine and doggs, maliciouſly endeavouring all evil againſt you, if they be provoked.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Uſe</hi> is <hi>Of Direction,</hi> to ſuch who intend the Office of the Miniſtry, not onely to labour after learning and godlineſſe, but prudence alſo. Even <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe, though raiſed up by God for ſo great a worke, doth ſometimes bewaile his imprudence and folly. <q>I many times (ſaith he) doe raſhly; and while I thinke to doe good, I doe hurt, and then I am troubled, beſeeching God to forgive me this impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</q> If a man have not ſo much learning, yet if he have godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prudence, he may doe more good than more eminent Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. As it's noted of <hi>Atticus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (one of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of <hi>Chryſostome)</hi> that he was farre inferiour to <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> for learning and abilities, yet did more good in his Office by his prudence,
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:48709:354"/>
being a very wiſe man, than he did. For <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> though ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a man, was very ſubject to paſſion; and being of a plaine, ſingle heart, did not diſcerne of men, as he ſhould doe; by which meanes his adverſaries prevailed over him, ſo to have him ejected from his place at laſt. But <hi>Atticus</hi> continued many years in that place, by his prudence and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet a godly man alſo.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we have this wiſdome?</p>
               <p>We muſt earneſtly pray to God for it, as the Apoſtle directeth, <hi>James</hi> 1. and <hi>Solomon</hi> practiſed. And withall, we muſt reade and ſtudy the Scripture much, following that as a ſtarre.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, It is good to be acquainted with <hi>Eccleſiasticall Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> For both from the godlineſſe, wiſdome, and alſo from the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of thoſe that are mentioned, we may get experience, and they may be as ſo many pillars of ſalt to ſeaſon us. <hi>Lege Historiam, ne fias Historia.</hi> And if thoſe who would get civil prudence, be required to reade humane Hiſtories, and to obſerve all occurrences therein, how much rather are the Miniſters of the Goſpel to exerciſe themſelves in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, not onely to know what was done formerly, or to be able to ſpeak about the Ancients, when they lived, and what their Doctrine was; but alſo to get prudence, by obſerving either their wiſe deportments, or impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent miſcarriages.</p>
               <p>

Of Inſtruction.</hi> Of what conſequence it is for a people to be perſwaded of the love and faithfull intentions of their Paſtors to their ſouls good; not to thinke they ſeeke themſelves, they ambiciouſly affect great things over them. For this made <hi>Paul</hi> take this ſolemne <hi>Oath</hi> in the Text, which he would not have done, had not the occaſion been urgent. What is it that maketh the miniſterial labours, either in preaching or eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing good order among their flock be ſo diſguſted and diſreliſhed, but becauſe they will not be convinced of the Miniſters faithfull aimes, and their great love in all this?</p>

So that this Text confoundeth all Papal Church-government, with the upholders thereof. For how abominable are the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Popiſh flatterers? affirming; <hi>That the Pope hath the ſame tribunal with Chriſt, that he can dispenſe againſt</hi> Paul'<hi>s Epiſtles, that he can do any thing,</hi> praeter, ſuper <hi>and</hi> extra jus; <hi>and that he is to judge all, but to be judged of none,</hi> with ſuch kind of blaſphemies. Yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth apply that prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah, Behold I lay in Sion a foundation-ſtone,</hi> which doth directly belong to Chriſt, even unto the Pope, though ſecondarily, but moſt blaſphemouſly. The Obſervation is,</p>

                  <hi>That though Chriſt hath inveſted the Officers of the Church, with ſome</hi>

               </p>
               <p>They may not preach what they will, nor command, and dictate what they will. Inſomuch that although their Paſtors ſay, Virtue is a vice, and vice a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, yet the people are bound to believe it, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his firſt Edition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but afterwards left it out. That all ſuch dominion by compulſion and force is excluded from the Miniſtry, appeareth plainly by thoſe two Texts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 15. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. Thoſe places do not forbid ſuch a fatherly paſtor-like power, that Chriſt hath beſtowed upon his Church-officers, but a civil domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo an eccleſiaſtical-magiſterial power in the Church, as if we were to believe, becauſe they ſay ſo. No our Saviour abſolutely prohibiteth that, when he ſaith, <hi>Be ye not called maſters, for one is your maſter, even Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 23. 10. Where alſo we are commanded, <hi>to call no man father.</hi> Hence the Papiſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly erre, in calling thoſe Ancients <hi>Fathers,</hi> thereby urging their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over our faith, as if we were bound to believe, what ever a Father ſaith. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if by Father we mean no more, than an Ancient, who hath lived long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; ſo the word may be allowed; but they call them ſo in a doctrinal and authoritative reſpect, as if we might not gain-ſay them, no more than ſonnes their father; but this doth contradict our Saviours command. Chriſt then is the onely Lord, and Head of his Church; whatſoever he ſaith, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to hear him, and that for his own authority; there is no diſputing, no doubting, no examination allowed of what he ſaith: but all Miniſters ſince the Apoſtles dayes are ſubject to errour, and may be deceived, and withall by their office they are ſtewards, not lords in the family; they are Embaſſadours onely, not Princes: Now ſuch have a limited power, they cannot do any thing of themſelves, any further than their Commiſſion extends, their power doth not extend. And truly (as was ſaid) if the Apoſtles, though infallible, would not challenge ſuch a dominion, ſuch a commanding power in the Church, (1 <hi>Cor. 7. 6. I ſpeak this not by commandment)</hi> but referreth all his doctrine, his power, and what he did to Chriſt, as the original; yea Chriſt as Mediator re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his doctrine and will to the Father. What ſhall become of thoſe ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Diotrepheſſes,</hi> who affect a greater power in the Church? But the Doctrine needeth explication in ſeveral particulars. And</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us ſee negatively, <hi>What is not forbidden or diſclaimed by the Apoſtles,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. What is not forbidden in this doctrine. 1. Not the lawfull eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and then <hi>poſitively.</hi> What is for the negative,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Apoſtle doth not here exclude that lawfull Eccleſiaſtical power which the Miniſters of God have after a ſpiritual manner in dispenſing of the Ordinances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt.</hi> Some indeed think it is not power or authority, but a gift. Others, that all their power is ſwallowed up by the Magiſtrate, when he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſtian; but certainly Chriſt appointed Paſtors and Teachers in his Church till his ſecond coming, and gave them power to preach the Word, to adminiſter Sacraments, to exerciſe Church-diſcipline, as might at large be proved, if this were a fit occaſion. The Apoſtle attributeth to himſelf a power once or twice; only he ſaith, it is for <hi>edification,</hi> not <hi>deſtruction,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 10. And he telleth theſe <hi>Corinthians, If he come again, he will not ſpare,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 6. he ſaith, <hi>He was in a readineſſe to revenge all diſobedience:</hi> And that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his, <hi>To caſt out the inceſtuous perſon,</hi> argued his power. Yea the names given them, that they are called <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> and that the people are to <hi>obey them,</hi> argue plainly there is a ſpiritual miniſterial power appointed by Chriſt in his Church. Of which more largely (God aſſiſting) in ſubſequent paſſages.</p>

2. Neither doth this expreſſion imply, <hi>That the Miniſters of the Gospel have their power from the people.</hi> As if they were <hi>Embaſſadonrs</hi> in their name, and <note place="margin">2. Neither doth it imply, that Miniſters have their power from the people.</note> acted with a power derived from them, as ſome have pleaded; for the office is of Chriſt, the deſignation and application of the perſon to the office, is by the Miniſtry of the Church, but they have not the office it ſelf from them. It's true, they are ſometimes called, <hi>The ſervants of the Church,</hi> but that is <hi>finaliter,</hi> not <hi>originaliter,</hi> becauſe the end of their office is for the good of the people; They have not theſe Offices for their own honour and dignity, but meerly for the good of others. So that although in reſpect of Chriſt, they are meerly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and ſervants, yet in reſpect of the Church and the people, they are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Paſtors, having a ſpiritual rule over them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither doth this expreſſion encourage <hi>a licentious boundleſſe queſtioning of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Neither doth it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>the Doctrine, that the Miniſters of the Gospel do deliver, becauſe they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, becauſe they are not commanded abſolutely to depend on them.</hi> Therefore ſome runne into a diſorderly extream, cavilling and queſtioning every thing that is taught. But you muſt know, that although every Chriſtian be allowed a judgement of diſcretion, and he is by his own faith to be ſaved. Hence the <hi>Bereans</hi> are accounted <hi>more noble,</hi> becauſe they compared the Doctrine delivered with the Scriptures; yet withall they are commanded to <hi>hear the Miniſters, highly to eſteem of them for the workes ſake; To obey them, and to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to them.</hi> So that the liberty a believer is allowed muſt not tend to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the office of the Miniſtry. It is true, here is much wiſdome and grace required in bounding the peoples liberty; and yet aſſerting their dependance upon the Miniſters whom God hath ſet over them, and from whom they are to ſeek direction and guidance: but this work is not to be done here. It is certain, they may mutually ſtand together; yea they were appointed by God for the mutual good of each other; and therefore it's nothing but corruption that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a contrariety herein; ſometimes by the Miniſters pride, and affectation of power; and ſometimes by the peoples pride and conceitedneſſe, whereby they refuſe humbly to ſubmit to ſuch order and officers as God hath commanded them. But this deſerveth a large Tractate. For all evil ariſeth in the Church, becauſe theſe bounds are tranſgreſſed. In ſome ages the officers tyranny, in other ages the peoples licentiouſneſs have much hindered the power of godlineſs, and the beauty of Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>By this is not excluded that duty, whereby Miniſters ought with holy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4, Here is not excluded the Miniſters duty to reprove ſin.</note> 
                  <hi>zeal and courage, reprove ſinne, and that in the greateſt of men.</hi> Yea and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are obſtinate and impenitent ſinners to refuſe the adminiſtration of the ſeals of Church-communion unto them. When the Apoſtle commanded this <hi>inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon</hi> (whom ſome think to be a man of great place among the <hi>Corinthians) to be caſt out,</hi> when he delivered <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> up to Satan; when he commands, <hi>If any walk diſorderly, to withdraw from ſuch,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 6. Yea <hi>and if any obey not his word, to note, or ſignifie ſuch a man.</hi> All theſe are demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of power, but not lordly dominion; yea where reproof, admonition, and excommunication are rightly adminiſtred to a ſpiritual heart awakened, they become more dreadfull than civil, or bodily puniſhments; becauſe what is done this way, God bindeth in Heaven; God caſteth ſuch out of his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and commands them, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> not to come in his preſence. Thus the Apoſtle doth not exclude theſe neceſſary miniſterial duties, although diſtaſtfull to fleſh and blood. Yea though corrupt perſons account them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the expreſſion of lordlineſſe. Even as when <hi>Lot</hi> reproved thoſe wicked <hi>Sodomites,</hi> they replied, <hi>He would be a Judge over them,</hi> Gen. 19. 9. and <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he rebuked the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſtriving one with another. How ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully did the injurious perſon anſwer him? <hi>Who made thee a Prince and a Judge over us?</hi> Exod. 2. 14. By this we ſee, how imbred a thing it is in all ſinners, if
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:48709:356"/>
they be reproved and controlled in their wickedneſſe, to account all nothing but dominion and lordlineſſe. Even the holy Government of the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt for ſpiritual and ſupernatural ends, and ſo wholly for the good of thoſe that go aſtray, yet by evil men hath been complained of, as worſe than <hi>Turkiſh ſlavery.</hi> How little do ſuch men conſider, what their Chriſtianity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth them unto? What it is to be baptized into the name of Chriſt, and to acknowledge him the Head, Lord, and Governour of his Church? For if they did, they would not ſay, <hi>Let us break his bends, and caſt his cords away from us.</hi> Is not the Diſcipline of Chriſt to be received, as well as his Doctrine? Did not the Apoſtle <hi>rejoyce to behold the faith and order of the Coloſſians?</hi> Col. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what is not excluded. Let us then conſider in the next place, <hi>What the Apoſtle doth poſitively ſhut out by this negative expreſſion, Not that we</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. What is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in it.</note> 
                  <hi>have dominion over you.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It doth exclude all abuſe and exceſſe even of lawfull power.</hi> For thoſe who <note place="margin">1. All abuſe of lawfull power</note> are true officers of Chriſt, having a lawfull power committed to them, may yet abuſe it, they may ſhew much raſhneſſe, too much auſterity in the exerciſe of it. Therefore in the next Chapter, we ſee this holy Apoſtle, though zealous to have this <hi>inceſtuous perſon</hi> caſt out, yet when truly humbled and repenting, he is no leſſe carefull to have him received again, requiring them to confirm their love to him, leſt he ſhould be <hi>ſwallowed up with too much grief.</hi> Some learned men have thought, that the primitive Biſhops did exceed in their auſterity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as appeareth by many Canons made againſt ſome ſinners, who for two or three years were not to be received into Church-communion, though truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting; yet ſome excuſe them, becauſe the condition of the times did then, they ſay, require it, that the Churches zeal againſt ſinne, might vindicate her againſt thoſe abominable calumnies caſt upon her by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as if ſhe did ſecretly nouriſh all impiety. And although ſhe was thus ſevere, yet the <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> did refuſe communion with the Church, as being too remiſſe, in that ſhe would at any time receive ſuch, who through fear apoſtatized in time of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, though never ſo ſincerely manifeſting their humiliation. Thus all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull auſterity, even in lawfull power, is excluded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By this the Apoſtle doth diſclaim all civil and political Government.</hi> Hence <note place="margin">2. All civil and political go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> the word <gap reason="foreign">

A civil power</hi> is coactive and compelling by force, which Church-power is not. And although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay, <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power is ridiculous and in vain, if it may not civilly compell.</hi> Yea a prophane Papiſt ſaith, <hi>Our Lord Chriſt had been indiſcreet, if he had not given this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power alſo.</hi> Yet they ſpeak this according to their humane apprehenſions, transforming Chriſts kingdome into an earthly and external one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hereby he excludeth a magisterial power, though in an eccleſiaſtical way, over conſciences.</hi> That is, he doth not aſſume to himſelf to be Lord in the Church, <note place="margin">3.

He doth not ſay, his Doctrine is his, the Sacraments are his; <hi>but as he received of the Lord, ſo he delivered to them.</hi> And this is that, for which the Proteſtants accuſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, That their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers arrogate to themſelves a Magiſterial power in the Church, pleading an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in Doctrine, by which they anathematize all as hereticks, who will not ſubſcribe thereunto. The Proteſtants doe acknowledge a miniſteriall power, but they will have a magiſterial one. There muſt be a ſupreame viſible Judge in the Church (ſay they) as there is in Commonwealths; elſe Chriſt hath not wiſely provided in his Church a ſufficient remedy againſt all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and ſchiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Laſtly, <hi>By this he doth exclude any ſinfull or wicked end.</hi> As if he did make the Church ſubſervient to any corrupt intereſt of his own. Officers are <note place="margin">4.

And thus it is in Church-officers, all their names are names of care, of diligence and labour. God hath not ſet them there for their carnal advantages, as if the people were made for them; but they are to promote the Kingdome of Chriſt, and to advance the ſouls of their hearers. Alas, the Church is Chriſts Spouſe, not theirs; it's Chriſts flock, not theirs; they died not for it, they were not crucified for it; neither are believers baptized into their name, but the name of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction.</hi> How happy and bleſſed a thing it is to ſee the Church of God in unity between Paſtors and people; the Officers not abuſing their power to ambition and tyranny, nor the people their liberty to licentiouſneſſe and wantonneſſe; when Paſtors and people ſtrive not about their reſpective power, but who ſhall moſt faithfully diſcharge their duties to one another. All diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Church hath for the moſt part come in at this breach. If a Church be <hi>Plebs adunita clero,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaid, Church and people united together, then what goeth to the diſſolving of this, tendeth to the deſtruction of the Church it ſelf. How much doth <hi>Ignatius</hi> (if they be his genuine Epiſtles) preſſe this ſubjection of people to Paſtors? And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly preſſe a loving and meek government in Officers. And no doubt, when God is angry with a people, then he ſends an evil ſpirit, as between <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> and the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> which tendeth to the conſumption of both. Let Miniſters therefore carefully avoid all affectation of unlawfull power, and people of unlawfull liberty. Let Paſtours looke upon their people, as the Spouſe of Chriſt, as purchaſed by his blood, and this will keepe them from lordly dominion; and let people look upon Paſtours, as the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Chriſt, coming in his name to them; and this will make them honour them, and have them in high eſteeme, both for their office, and works ſake. But other parts of this Epiſtle will provoke to greater enlargement herein.</p>

There have indeed been ſuch unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſalt, prophane Miniſters of the Goſpel, whoſe work hath been to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hands of wicked men, to preach peace and mercy to them while wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in their ſinnes; but wo to ſuch Paſtors, and ſuch a people. Theſe are ſharply reproved in the Scripture, for there alwaies will be ſuch men-pleaſers, ſuch <hi>daubers with untempered mortar,</hi> as <hi>Jer. 6. 14. They heal the hurt of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſlightly, ſaying, Peace, Peace, when there is no peace.</hi> Would you have ſuch a Phyſician that ſhould flatter you about the wounds of your body, ſaying, it will heal, it will heal, when thou feeleſt it to putrifie more and more?

Hence in the ſecond place, <hi>We are to help the joy of thoſe whoſe grace we have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Miniſters are to help their joy whoſe graces they have before helped.</note> 
                  <hi>helped before.</hi> Joy cannot be the firſt ſtone in Gods building, grace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is firſt, and then conſolation; The ſpirit of God is firſt a <hi>ſanctifier,</hi> and then a <hi>comforter.</hi> So that many people take a prepoſterous method; if they be ſick, they look the Miniſter ſhould preſently give them comfort; there muſt not a word be ſaid of their ſinnes, of the neceſſity of repentance, this will make them deſpair. Fond and fooliſh people, why would ye be tickled into hell? why would ye be pleaſed into damnation? oh it cannot be that thou ſhouldſt have comfort before godlineſſe, this would be to falſifie the covenant of God, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe the ſeal of pardon, applying it to him; whom God doth ſtill hold guilty, Underſtand then Gods method, and ſubmit thereunto, ſaying, I do not expect comfort; I would not have the promiſes of grace applied to me while thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and impenitent in my ſinful waies, but if thou art found godly, then we are to comfort and to comfort, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 1. again and again, not giving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till that evil ſpirit of unbeleef be caſt out: And this ſpirituall comfort is ſeen in two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Comfort under the guilt of ſinne,</hi> and truly herein we do a moſt acceptable work. Then it is indeed <hi>the tongue of the learned,</hi> when we ſpeak <hi>a word in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to ſuch afflicted ſpirits; how ready and willing are the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel to bring the balm of <hi>Gilead</hi> to ſuch perſons? how pittifull and compaſſionate becauſe they know the terrour of the Lord? God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to be <hi>Meſſengers of peace,</hi> and like <hi>Noahs</hi> dove to come with an Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch, aſſuring them that the waters are abated; and oh that God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſuch comforting work for us; It is very ſeldome to meet with ſuch: we have work enough to reprove the prophane, to inſtruct the erroneous; but how few do need comfort becauſe their ſinnes are a heavy burthen upon them.</p>
               <p>In the 2. place, we are to help <hi>the comfort of the godly in reſpect of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward afflictions.</hi> For they are more chaſtened than other men; there is no god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man but God hath appointed a croſſe for him; yea, ſometimes many croſſes together. Now how neceſſary is it to have a faithful and wiſe comforter in ſuch caſes? for alas, our own hearts are full of diſcouragements, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is ready to appear more terrible than it is, and the devil he is very ready to make the waters overflow more than they would do. So that to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter comfort to ſuch diſconſolate perſons, is the beſt act of love, and the moſt ſuitable alms that can be deſired. Seeing then that grace muſt be laid, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for comfort;</p>
               <p>Hence in the third place, <hi>Before the Miniſters of the Gospel can adminiſter comfort to unregenerate perſons, they muſt neceſſarily uſe ſharp and bitter means,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Sharp means are to be uſed before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> 
                  <hi>as preparatory there unto.</hi> Neither are we then to be blamed, or judged too cruell and auſtere, but ſinne is to be condemned as the cauſe of it. It is your ſinne that maketh all bitter things neceſſary. When the Phyſician adminiſtreth bitter Phyſick, which maketh thee exceeding ſick, is he to be blamed? and not rather thoſe peccant humours within us. The ground muſt be plowed up, and have its bowels as it were moved, ere the good ſeed can be ſown into it: The wool muſt be carded, and torn as it were in peeces, ere it be made for a garment. The ſtone muſt come under the hammer and ſaw, ere it be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the building. And thus ere the heart of man be fit to receive Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort, it muſt be humbled and broken by the Law of God: So that we are making way for your comfort even while we denounce the curſes of the Law: To preach of hell and damnation, though it be grievous to you, yet it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; Therefore do not thou cry out againſt ſuch men that have the Law, hell and damnation ſo much in their mouths, for this is the way to poliſh and prepare thee for comfort; we do not forget the Goſpel while we preach ſo:

neither are we to be accounted as legall Preachers; and not ſuch as preach Chriſt, for hereby we levell the mountain for Chriſt to come, hereby we ſtreighten the camels back, that it may go through the eye of the needle; yea, all thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cenſures inflicted upon offenders, are for comfort; if thou art reproved, and that ſharply and zealouſly, it is for thy comfort: yea, if thou art for thy ſcandalous and impenitent waies caſt out from Church-communion, and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſeals of comfort: yet all this is medicinall, and maketh a way for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.

               <p>In the next place, let us conſider the grounds, <hi>why Miniſters are to promote</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Why Miniſters are to comfort the people. 1. Becauſe they are Miniſters of the Goſpel.</note> 
                  <hi>the comfort of ſuch who are fit ſubjects for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, <hi>Becauſe they are Miniſters of the Goſpel:</hi> and what is that but the <hi>glad tidings</hi> of pardon of ſin, of reconciliation, and of everlaſting happineſſe? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is noted to ſignifie not only <hi>glad tidings</hi> but <hi>the reward</hi> alſo given unto the meſſengers thereof. What then is more ſuitable to the Miniſters of comfort but to bring comfort, that we may ſay, as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Ahimaaz, he is a good man, and bringeth good tidings?</hi> If a Miniſter be a <hi>Boanerges, a ſon of thunder,</hi> it is that he may be <hi>a ſon of conſolation.</hi> It is not contrary to their commiſſion to preach of ſinne, and of the day of judgement, for ſo <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Felix,</hi> which made him tremble; only we are not to ſtay here; we muſt not keep you all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies under this Schoolmaſter, but bring you at laſt to Chriſt. Inſomuch that all our duties tend to this, even to advance the Goſpel in the hearts of hearers; yea, every doctrine of Chriſt, as it is a doctrine after godlineſſe, ſo it is alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſolation. And therefore if any opinion do properly make againſt godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we may reject it: and ſo if any do truly make againſt ſolid comfort, we may refuſe that, as not being of Chriſt. It is true, many hereticall and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons may pretend to great comforts and raviſhments; They uſually ſay, they never had ſo much comfort as ſince they engaged in ſuch waies; but then you muſt remember that the devil may be transformed into an angel of light: and as there is a counterfeit pie y, ſo there is alſo a counterfeit comfort. It is not enough then to have comfort, but it is to be judged and tried by Gods word. Neither may we ſay, this is a comfortable doctrine, therefore I will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, but firſt ſee it be a true Scripture-doctrine, and then receive it, for ſuch to be ſure will alſo be comfortable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We are to help forward the godly mans comfort, becauſe the heart of man awakened for ſinne is very much indiſpoſed to receive it, and the devil he is a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Becauſe an awakened heart is much indiſpoſed to it.</note> 
                  <hi>oppoſer of it.</hi> That the heart of man wounded for ſin doth difficultly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive conſolation, is plain, becauſe joy is the fruit of Gods ſpirit, and the ſpirit of God is given not only to ſanctifie us, but to vouchſafe conſolation alſo, ſo that as a man hath a dead womb, in reſpect of grace, he is not able to have one good thought without Gods ſpirit, ſo he hath alſo a dead womb in reſpect of comfort, he is not able to have one comfortable thought, unleſſe God who is called <hi>the God of all conſolation,</hi> infuſe it into him: and then the devil is a daily oppoſer of our comforts as well as our graces; as he is a tempter to ſinne, ſo to unbeleef and diſcouragements: he loveth to keep us as he did the <hi>lunatick</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon about the tombs, in thoughts of our hypocriſie and damnation, that God doth not love us, that he hath caſt us off. Is it not then neceſſary to endeavour the comfort of a godly man, when it is ſo greatly gainſaid both within and without?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Our duty is to perſwade to comfort, becauſe hereby the heart is more enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. Becauſe hereby the heart is more quickned to godlineſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>and quickned unto all godlineſſe: The joy of the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 10. It is like oyl to the wheels. With what delight and gladneſſe doth a joyfull beleever exerciſe himſelf in all holiheſſe? with what
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:48709:359"/>
courage and confidence doth he diſcharge all the duties required of him? The ſpirit of God did come upon the Prophet when he played upon the harp; The more chearfull, the more prepared to receive power from God; as the drier the paper is, the fitter to receive characters; whereas upon wet paper none can write. As it doth thus enable us to do, no leſſe alſo doth it fortifie us to ſuffer: We ſee with what readineſſe and undaunted courage the Martyrs endured the moſt exquiſite torments; and why ſo? but becauſe they were filled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy: inſomuch that their condition was ſar better than the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous and flouriſhing eſtate of any wicked men. They were <hi>infeliciter felices,</hi> and theſe were <hi>feliciter infelices,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid: So that in promoting holy joy we advance grace and godlineſſe alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> firſt of inſtruction to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to anſwer the main end of their office, which is to <hi>be comforters; not to be Marahs but Naomies:</hi> Spiritual <hi>conſolation</hi> is the proper fruit of the ſpirit of Adoption, and therefore a pearl highly to be eſteemed: and that they may do this, they muſt attend to their <hi>doctrine</hi> and their <hi>practiſe:</hi> Their <hi>doctrine,</hi> and thus in Popery in ſtead of building up they deſtroy comfort; the doctrine of <hi>uncertainty</hi> and doubting about the ſtate of grace; the doctrine of ſatisfaction and merits, theſe are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable doctrines. Indeed ſome adverſaries ſay, the doctrine of <hi>abſolute predeſtination,</hi> and that Chriſt died but for <hi>ſome only,</hi> and <hi>not all,</hi> is an uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doctrine. Hence their ſaying is <hi>ſpiritus Calvinianus eſt ſpiritus Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus.</hi> The <hi>Antinomians</hi> they alſo ſay, to preach the Law and repentance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as in a way to obtain remiſſion of ſins, is a method of preaching, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth all comfort, but theſe might eaſily be confuted if it were our buſineſſe. It is a Miniſters duty to ſee the doctrine he preacheth, doth not in its own <hi>genius,</hi> and as a proper effect work deſpair or diſcouragement; And then for their practiſe, they muſt be carefull that all reproofs, admonitions, and ſpiritual cenſures be ſo managed, that though for the while they may ſeem bitter, yet at the laſt they will bring much comfort; and that though they be in pain for a while, yet they ſhall at laſt rejoyce to ſee a manchilde born.</p>

                  </gap>, it is brought in as an argument of ſomething prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it is very difficult to finde out the reaſon: Thoſe Interpreters that take notice of it are divided, Some do make it a reaſon of the words immediatly foregoing: <hi>Paul</hi> was a helper <hi>of their joy,</hi> becauſe they ſtood firmly in the <hi>faith;</hi> for although there were ſome who denied the reſurrection, yet that was not the doctrine of the Chuch in general, nor was it puhlikely profeſſed by them: It is true, many abuſes there were in practice both civill and religious, yet becauſe they did firmly retain the true faith, therefore it was that he would not wholly caſt them off as no Church; Their true doctrine which they profeſſed made him the more hopeful of them; and certainly the pure ſound faith profeſſed by a Church, though otherwiſe greatly corrupted, maketh it to have the eſſence and life of a Church, and withall ſuggeſteth hope, that God in time will make them an holy practical Church, as well as a ſound Orthodox one, Hence <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> c. 3. v. 5, 6, 7. doth much rejoyce in their faith, that they <hi>ſtood ſtedfaſt</hi> therein; <hi>When I could no longer forbear I ſent to know your faith.</hi> As alſo <hi>Timotheus</hi> brought him glad tidings of their faith: And again, <hi>we were comforted in our affliction by your faith,</hi> and this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is very probable, and not to be wholly rejected. But then a ſecond is more probable, and that maketh it a reaſon of the former part of the verſe. <hi>We have not dominion over your faith, for by faith ye ſtand ſtedfaſt:</hi> Inſomuch that if <hi>I Paul,</hi> or an <hi>Angel</hi> from heaven ſhould preach unto you another doctrine, yet you beleeve in the truth, as Gods truth, and not mans truth; So that God alone hath the dominion over your hearts in beleeving. Thus it is a very fit and proper reaſon. Hence <hi>Heinſius</hi> thinketh there is a tranſpoſition of the words, which is uſuall with <hi>Paul,</hi> and that they ſhould be inſerted before the later clauſe, thus; <hi>Not that we have dominion over your faith, for by faith you ſtand;</hi> Whether we reade it objectively, <hi>you ſtand in the faith;</hi> or inſtrumentally, <hi>by faith you ſtand;</hi> it is not much materiall: Neither are we to render it in the paſt ſignification, <hi>you have ſtood,</hi> becauſe it is <gap reason="foreign">

So that we doe not believe in Magiſtrates, nor in Miniſters, nor in the Church, truſting our faith and ſalvation upon them, but the word of God onely; whereas the Papiſts do expreſly affirm, That a private Chriſtians faith is enough to ſalvation, if he content himſelf with this, <hi>That he believeth as the Church believeth,</hi> never troubling himſelf in reading of books, or ſearching of the Scripture. As <hi>Valentia's</hi> known inſtance of a Merchant, brought in by him, diſputing, What Religion he ſhould be of? doth evidently declare. So then, a Papiſt, as a Papiſt, cannot reach any higher than to an <hi>humane faith.</hi> For though they will not yeeld the Authority of the Church to be an humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet both reaſon and experience doth fully convince that. But let us come to our own people, and ſadly bewail the ignorance and ſtupidity of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in general, who are not moved by any divine motives or Scripture-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to imbrace their Religion, but onely are perſwaded herein by external motives, very few being able to give a reaſon of the faith or hope that is in them, which yet the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> requireth of every man and woman, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. What reaſon have they, but their fathers example, and the Lawes of the Land? So that it is meerly accidental, that they do receive a true Religion;
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:48709:360"/>
for it had been Heretical and Idololatrical, it had been all one to them, they would have entertained it however. But to this particular, you muſt obſerve one Caution: It's one thing to ſpeak of the Introductory and Preparatory means of faith; and another thing of the ultimate and formal motive or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why I do believe. We do readily grant, That the true Churches Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery may prepare for a divine faith: <hi>What is Paul, and what is Apollo, but Miniſters by whom ye believe?</hi> ſaith the Scripture (1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.) Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> had his faith by the godly education of his <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Yea <hi>(John</hi> 4.) we reade of the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> inſtrumental to bring many people to believe on Chriſt onely; yet obſerve that expreſſion, <hi>verſ. 42. Now we believe not, becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves.</hi> Godly Miniſters then, and godly parents may be greatly helpfull to us in true believing; but then the reaſon and chief motive is, from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scripture, declaring this truth. We doe not believe in Miniſters, nor in the Church. And thus you muſt underſtand that paſſage of <hi>Jehoſhaphats,</hi> (Chron. 20. 20.) <hi>Believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed: believe the Prophets, ſo ſhall ye prosper. Believe in God</hi> ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately, but <hi>believe the Prophets</hi> miniſterially. So that it would be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick preſumption, out of a perſwaſion that onely worketh faith, thereby to caſt off thoſe uſefull helps and means which he hath appointed for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of faith.</p>
               <p>In the next general place, we are to know, <hi>That two things are neceſſarily</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Two things required to the working of a divine faith. 1. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in us, God.</note> 
                  <hi>required to the working of a divine faith:</hi> The one <hi>Effectively;</hi> The other <hi>Objectively:</hi> The principle that worketh faith in us, and the reaſon or motive thereof: The principle that worketh faith in us, is God alone. None can make the heart of man to believe Scripture-truths, but God onely. Hence <hi>Faith is the gift of God;</hi> ſo ſome are ſaid, <hi>To believe through grace,</hi> Act. 18. 27. Is it not plain in the Phariſees, notwithſtanding they heard our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our preach, and alſo ſaw his wonderfull miracles, yet to them it was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to believe, or to know the myſteries of God; but to others more unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and contemptible it was. Hence it falleth out, that the moſt learned men are many times moſt Atheiſtical, or at leaſt Sceptical and doubting in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Inſomuch that we are to be importunate with God in prayer, that he would both work and increaſe faith in us. Hence Chriſt is ſaid to be, both the <hi>authour and finiſher of our faith,</hi> Hebr. 12. 2. It's the mighty power of God, ſo enlightning and enabling thee, that thou doeſt adhere to the truth. For how many ſpecious arguments may be produced againſt the faith? How mutable are many in forſaking the faith they once profeſſed, and turn Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical? So that it is a ſpecial work of Gods grace to make thee ſtand firme in the faith, eſpecially in times of temptation. To be a pillar in the Temple of the Lord, and not a reed ſhaken with every winde, is a glorious preſervation. For it's plain, that it's fancy, errour, or humour that lead many in Religion, and not this holy precious faith.</p>
               <p>Again, The ſecond thing neceſſarily concurring to a divine faith, is a <note place="margin">2. A divine te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, Gods word.</note> 
                  <hi>Divine teſtimony;</hi> it muſt be <hi>Gods word.</hi> We muſt have the Doctrine from Chriſt, elſe our faith is but an humane faith, and ſo our Religion, but an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Religion. The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> are commended by <hi>Paul, That they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Word, not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God;</hi> and when ſo received, it effectually worketh in thoſe that believe. Alas, what is the reaſon, there is ſo little holineſſe, ſo little godlineſſe? It is becauſe there is ſo little divine faith. The truths we preach are not received as the word of God; we look no further or higher than to a man in theſe things: we doe not hear and tremble, we doe not beleeve and tremble; we riſe not up with heart-reverence, as <hi>Eglon,</hi> though an <hi>Heathen</hi> did
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:48709:361"/>
to <hi>Ehud,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>He had a meſſage from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, In that the true Chriſtian faith floweth from ſuch a divine <note place="margin">3. Hence it is that none can have a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over the faith of a believer.</note> principle, and ariſeth from ſuch a divine motive, <hi>Hence it is that no kinde of perſons have an abſolute Sovereignty over the faith of a believer; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doe arrogate it to themſelves, they aſſume the property of the Almighty, and moſt infinite God.</hi> They arrogate to themſelves the peculiar and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable property of Chriſt, which is to be the Head of the Church, and a Law-giver in reſpect of any Doctrine, Worſhip or Ordinances. It is true, there have been ſuch, eſpecially the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated to himſelf, ſetting himſelf in the Temple of God, as God; but the blaſphemies of ſuch have been written (as it were) in their fore-heads, and hereby they are juſtly deemed to be a <hi>Political,</hi> or <hi>Church-Antichriſt,</hi> as there is a <hi>Doctrinal Antichriſt.</hi> But we affirme, <hi>That no kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can have dominion over a mans faith,</hi> ſeeing it hath ſuch a peculiar refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Not ſpiritual and Church Rulers, or Eccleſiaſtical Governours.</hi> If <note place="margin">1. No Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governours.</note> the Apoſtles would not aſſume it, who then may? It is true, there are ſeveral Texts in Scripture, which command us to hear our Paſtours, to obey them, to <hi>ſubmit unto them, to have them highly in eſteeme for their workes ſake.</hi> Such as doe not hear them, are to be accounted as <hi>Heathens and Publicans.</hi> They are endowed with power to <hi>Admoniſh and rebuke ſharply:</hi> Yea, where obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy is in ſinners, <hi>To caſt them out of the Church.</hi> But all this doth not ariſe to a <hi>Magiſterial Domination</hi> over mens conſciences. And although they have power to binde and looſe, which God himſelf promiſeth to confirme in Heaven; yet all this is declaratively and miniſterially onely. How farre there is a deciſive power in Councils to extinguiſh all errours and hereſies, is not here to be debated. This is enough, that as no particular perſon, ſo no Councils, though never ſo oecomenical can ſay, we have dominion over your faith. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>No civil power hath dominion over any mans faith.</hi> No Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate can make Articles of Faith, can appoint another worſhip of God, or <note place="margin">2. No civil governours.</note> other Sacraments than Chriſt hath appointed. Faith is not <hi>Caeſar's</hi> gift, neither can any man believe, <hi>Praecisè quia vult,</hi> as <hi>Mirandula</hi> declareth, <hi>meerly becauſe he will.</hi> How farre Magiſtrates have power in matters of Religion is greatly diſputed and determined by the exceſſe in ſome, and by the defect in others. But however no Kings or Emperours can ſay, <hi>We have dominion over your faith,</hi> no more than they can ſay, <hi>We are the true and great Jehovah.</hi> They cannot make a Religion, make Sacraments, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the obſervance of that which is required in the Word; and the reaſon which excludeth both ſpiritual and civil Governours, is general to all. We are not baptized into any mans name, neither hath any <hi>Emperour</hi> or Church-officer died for us; they have not been crucified for us; neither have they power over our hearts, to impoſe a command upon them, which muſt neceſſarily be in the duty of faith; neither can they damne or ſave men. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There is one Law-giver, which is able to ſave and to deſtroy,</hi> Jam. 4. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Although divine faith be ſuch a noble and excellent work, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Heaven, and aſcending up to Heaven againe, <hi>Yet it doth admit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Faith admits of degrees.</note> 
                  <hi>of degrees in the ſubject where it is.</hi> Some have <hi>ſtronger faith,</hi> ſome <hi>weaker,</hi> ſome have more explicite and extenſive faith, than others; yea and the moſt ſetled beleevers are ſubject to temptations; they are often aſſaulted, and that even in their faith about the principles and fundamentals, about God, about the Scriptures, about the immortality of the Soul, about the ſtate of Glory, and eternal Torments. Fiery darts are ſometimes injected,
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:48709:361"/>
for which the people of God doe abhorre and loath themſelves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>little faith,</hi> and <hi>no faith,</hi> between <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> and <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> And truely for this end doth God ſuffer errours and hereſies to ariſe in his Church, that truth may be more confirmed, and the approved may be made manifeſt. It's to exerciſe the ſpiritual wiſdome and faith of the godly, whether they can diſcerne of things that differ, and can tell which is the ſtrangers voice, and which is the true ſhepherds. It is a very grievous temptation to be aſſaulted about fiducial faith, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes belong to thee in particular; but in ſome reſpects it is farre more terrible to be exerciſed in doubts about dogmatical faith: for this tendeth to the razing of the foundations, and the arguments or remedies to cure this diſtemper are more difficult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction.</hi> Is faith thus immediately reſpecting God above all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though making uſe of them? Then</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theirs is not faith, which doth wholly depend upon the Authority of a man, though never ſo eminent. We may not relie on <hi>Auſtine,</hi> on <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> neither doe we owne thoſe expreſſions of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts.</hi> For although we acknowledge them eminent inſtruments in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of the Goſpel, yet we believe not upon their authority meerly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith ſo. It is true, nothing is more ordinary, than to admire mens perſons, and while we extoll their gifts and abilities, we are ſecretly enticed to thinke of worthy men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, above what we ought, and finde an awe in our conſciences to recede from any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have delivered: But we muſt take heed, we doe not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become guilty of ſpirituall Idolatry, ſetting up men as Idols in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This inſtructeth, that groſſe ignorant men cannot have any divine faith; for they feel nothing of any work of Gods Spirit, or illumination upon their underſtandings; hence they believe as other men believe, as if a man were not to be ſaved by his own faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſheweth the <hi>Sceptical</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> man in Religion, the meer Seeker, that he hath no faith. If he had the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen upon his ſoul, he would not be toſſed up and down, as he is.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It ſheweth, that the meer carnal <hi>Politician</hi> hath no divine faith, for he looketh upon Religion, but as an humane device, or a State-engine, and therefore can transforme into all ſhapes and times. How contrary is this to true faith?</p>
