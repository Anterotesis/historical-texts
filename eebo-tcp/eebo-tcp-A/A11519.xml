            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BEhold heere moſt illuſtrious Prince, the ſumme of all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid nine and thirty Chapters, now reſteth to ſhew unto your Highneſſe the reaſon of them all: but firſt that we may diſcourſe more ſoundly, it will be needfull for me to relate when, how, and for what cauſe the office of th'inquiſition was inſtituted in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and at what time, and in what forme it was admitted into this famous City of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beginning therefore from thence I will ſay, that although Hereſies by Divine permiſſion, were ſowne in the World, for the exerciſe and triall of good Catholicks, even in thoſe times as the Church began, &amp;c. after our Lords Aſcenſion, yet the particular office of th 'Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt Hereticks, did not beginne till after the yeare one thouſand two hundred.</p>
               <p>The Holy Apoſtles left for a remedy to this peſtilence, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick ſhould be ad moniſhed once or twice, and that periſhing in his obſtinacy, Catholicks ſhould ſeparate themſelves from his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and excommunicate him. Nor was there any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding untill <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, who embraced the holy Faith, and was after imitated by his ſucceſſors. Then amongſt other things the Saints taught Princes, that they having two callings, the one of Chriſtians, the other of Princes; were bound in both of them to ſerve God as Chriſtians, in obſerving of the Divine precepts, as every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private Perſon; but as Princes, ſerving his Divine Majeſty with well ordering of Lawes, and directing their ſubjects to Piety, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and Juſtice; puniſhing all ſuch as tranſgreſſe the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and eſpecially thoſe of the Decalogue: For thoſe that ſinne againſt the firſt Table, which concerneth Divine honor, are worſe than they who ſin againſt the Second; which concerneth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice among men: Wherefore Princes are more bound to puniſh Blaſphemies Hereſies, and perjuries; than murthers and thefts: For this cauſe were divers Lawes made againſt Hereſies, which are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodoſian</hi> Codes, impoſing upon the guilty pecuniary mulcts, baniſhments; privation of part, or of all their goods, according to the circumſtances of the offence, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which Lawes was committed to their ſecular Officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:17288:7"/>
Every criminall Iudgement hath three parts; the Cogniſance of the cauſe of the delict, the Cogniſance of the fact; and the ſentence. In the Iudgement for Hereſie, the Cogniſance of the reaſon is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an opinion be Hereticall or no: The Cogniſance of the fact is, whether a Perſon ſo accuſed, or denounced, hath defended or held; or ſhewed any token of holding that opinion: The ſentence conſiſteth either in abſolving the guiltleſſe from an imputation, or condemning him that he is found guilty. The firſt Cogniſance, what opinion is Hereticall, was alwayes Eccleſiaſticall, neither can it any way belong to the ſecular Power; and when in thoſe dayes there grew any difficulty upon ſome opinion, the Emperours did require the judgement of Biſhops; and if neede were did call Counſels: But the Cogniſance of the fact, whether the accuſed Perſon were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or guilty, that he might have the puniſhment ordained by the Lawes; and the ſentence of Condemnation, or Abſolution, did all belong to the ſecular Power.</p>
               <p>Some of the holy Biſhops and Prelates of thoſe times, after they had declared what opinions were Hereticall, and had ſeparated from the Church as excomunicate, and anathematized thoſe that did hold them; enter-medled no further, nor durſt give notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the Magiſtrates; holding it to be no worke of entire Charity. Others having perceived, that feare of the ſecular Magiſtrate did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the pertinacy of the obſtinate, and did worke that, which love of the Truth could not doe; held it as their duty to make knowne the Hereticall Perſons, unto ſecular Iudges; together with their erronious opinions, and to excite them to put the Imperiall Lawes in execution: But becauſe ſometimes a Heretick Preacher did cauſe ſome notable trouble, the Iudges regarding the ſedition more than the hereſie, did proceede alſo to Capitall puniſhments; the Church-men did in theſe caſes forbeare to appeare before the tribunall, and did alwayes uſe unfeigned exhortation to the Iudges, that they ſhould inflict no puniſhments of blood upon the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. St <hi>Martin</hi> in <hi>France</hi> excommunicated a Biſhop, becauſe he had accuſed certaine Hereticks to <hi>Maximus</hi> Uſurper of the Empire, which by him were put to death. St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo moſt zealous of the purity of the Church, to cleare it of this evill ſeede; did often and earneſtly deſire the Proconſuls, Counts, and other Imperiall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in <hi>Africk,</hi> for to execute the Princes Lawes; and would make knowne unto them the places where Hereticks held their conventicles, and did diſcover the Perſons: But alwayes when hee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17288:7"/>
ſaw any Iudge inclined to proceede againſt the life, hee earneſtly prayed him, by the mercies of God, by the love of Chriſt, and ſuch like urging intreaties, that hee ſhould deſiſt from puniſhments of blood: And in an Epiſtle to <hi>Donatus</hi> Proconſul of <hi>Africke,</hi> hee tels him plainely, that if hee doe perſevere in puniſhing of Hereticks, with the loſſe of their lives, then the Biſhop would forbeare giving notice of them; and not being made knowne by others, they would reſt unpuniſhed, and the Imperiall Lawes unexecuted: Whereas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mildly and without blood-ſhed, they would have bin vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant in diſcovering them; and notifying of them for the Service of God, and execution of the Lawes.</p>
               <p>In this manner were things handled in the Church, for cauſes of hereſie under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, untill the yeare of our Salvation 800. when the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> Empire being divided from the <hi>Weſterne,</hi> this forme reſted in the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> untill the end of it.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Weſterne,</hi> the Princes needed not make any Lawes, nor take much care about this buſineſſe; ſeeing that for the ſpace of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, from 800. to 1100. there were very few Hereticks found in theſe parts, and when any caſe did happen (which chanced but very ſeldome) the Biſhop did Iudge of it, in the ſame manner as he proceeded againſt Eccleſiaſticall Perſons; as againſt infringers of the Holy-dayes, breakers of Faſts, and ſuch like, judging and puniſhing them themſelves, in thoſe places where they had jurisdiction gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by the Princes; and where they had not the like power, they did implore the ſecular ayde to puniſh them.</p>
               <p>After the yeare 1100, by reaſon of the continuall unkindneſſes, which for fifty yeares before had bin betweene the Popes and the Emperours, and laſted afterwards for a whole age, untill 1200. with frequent Warres, and ſcandals, and the little Religious life of the Clergy, there did ariſe an infinite number of Hereticks, whoſe moſt common hereſies were againſt the Popes Authority: In thoſe dayes the plague of hereſie grew ſo faſt, that where the multitude excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there was a forced tolleration: A Biſhop where he could, did proceed in thoſe cauſes: the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> did with frequent Letters exhort, and excite them to their duties: neither untill the yeare 1200 was ever heard the name of the Office of the Inquiſition, or of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor againſt Hereſie: But the Biſhops &amp; their Vicars being little able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and leſſe diligent to performe that which the Popes deſired, and had beene neceſſary to have beene done, there were in thoſe dayes moſt opportunely inſtituted the two Religious Orders of St. <hi>Dominick</hi> and St. <hi>Frances,</hi> which in ſhort time were filled up with the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17288:8"/>
and learned Perſons of that Age, altogether given to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pontificall authority; whom the Popes uſing againſt Hereticks, they ſent them to Preach, and to convert them; to exhort the Princes and Catholicke Nations to perſecute the obſtinate, and to informe themſelves in each place of the number and quality of Hereticks, of the Zeale of the Catholicks, and diligence of the Biſhops; and to bring their relations to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence they had the names of Inquiſitors: Yet had they no Tribunall, onely ſometimes they would excite ſome Iudge to baniſh or puniſh thoſe Hereticks which they found: ſometimes they would ſtirre up ſome Potent men to take Armes againſt them; ſome times they did excite the people, ſowing a croſſe of red cloth upon the garments of ſuch as would dedicate themſelves to ſuch an action, and would unite them, and bring them on to the extirpacion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and this laſted for the ſpace of fifty yeares: viz. untill the yeare one thouſand two hundred and fifty.</p>
               <p>This enterprize of the Fathers Inquiſitory was much furthered by the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the Second, who in the yeare 1244. being in <hi>Padua,</hi> ſet forth foure Proclamations concerning this matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Inquiſitors into his protection, and impoſing the penalty of fire upon obſtinate Hereticks, and upon penitent ones perpetuall impriſonment, committing the Cogniſance thereof unto the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Perſons, and the condemning of them unto ſecular Iudges: and this was the firſt Law that impoſed puniſhment of death upon Hereticks, which Law (by reaſon of the cruell diſcords that aroſe in thoſe dayes, betweene the Emperour and three Popes ſucceſſively) did not bring forth that good effect of rooting out the ſprung up Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, but being all buſied in Warres and diſſentions, as well the Popes and other Prelates, as the Emperours and his Miniſters; Hereſie had time to take roote and increaſe. Finrlly, the Emperour <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> dying that ſame yeare, and the buſineſſe of <hi>Germany</hi> being in a confuſion, and <hi>Italy</hi> in an <hi>Interregnum</hi> which laſted three and twenty yeares; Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth, remaining through the death of the Emperour as it were Arbitrator in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and ſome other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> applyed his whole ſtudy to the rooting out of Hereſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were much increaſed in theſe late troubles: and having conſidered the good the <hi>Dominican</hi> and <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Friers had done in this buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Through their diligence, having no reſpect of perſons or dangers therein, he held it as his onely remedy to imploy them, not as before
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17288:8"/>
onely to Preach, and aſſemble men marked with the Croſſe, and to doe extraordinary executions, but with giving them a ſtable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and erecting them a firme Tribunall, which ſhould have care of nothing elſe. To this, two things oppoſed themſelves: the one was how they might without confuſion take away caſes of Hereſie from the Epiſcopall juriſdiction, which had alwayes judged them, and ſet up an Office proper to them alone. The other thing was, how they might exclude the ſecular Magiſtrate, to whoſe judgement was committed the puniſhing of Hereticks by the ancient Lawes of the Empire, by the laſt Lawes of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and by peculiar Statutes which each City was forced to make, for feare of overthrowing her government in thoſe great tumults. To the firſt inconvenience the Pope found this remedy, which was to make a Tribunall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of th' Inquiſitor and the Biſhop, in which th' Inquiſitor ſhould not onely be chiefe, but, all and the Biſhop ſhould have little more than a name in it; and alſo to give ſome appearance of Authority to the ſecular Power, he gave him leave to appoint Officers to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, but to be choſen by the Inquiſitors themſelves; to ſend with the Inquiſitor, when any of his Aſſeſſors did goe about the Country, but of the Election of the Inquiſitor himſelfe, to apply one third part of goods confiſcate to the Commonalty, and ſuch like things, which in ſhew made the Magiſtrate the Inquiſitors companion, but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance his Servant: There remained to provide money for expences which would ariſe, in keeping of Priſons, and feeding of Priſoners, for which it was ordered that the Comminalty ſhould pay: And ſo it was ordered, he being in <hi>Breſcia</hi> in the yeare 1251, and the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryers were deputed Inquiſitors, in <hi>Lombardy, Romanie,</hi> and <hi>Marca Triviſana.</hi> Seven Moneths after the Pope writ a Bull to all the Governors, Councells and Commonalties of thoſe three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, ſetting them downe one and thirty heads which they ſhould obſerve, for the proſperous ſucceſſe of the new Office, commanding that they ſhould be Regiſtred in the Commonalties Statute Bookes, to be inviolably obſerved. Then he gave the Inquiſitors power to Excommunicate and interdict them, if they did not obſerve them. The Pope did not at that time extend himſelfe any further, to bring in th' Inquiſition into other places of <hi>Italy,</hi> or without ſaying that thoſe three Provinces were moſt under his eyes, and beſt of him beloved: but the chiefe cauſe was, becauſe in theſe his Authority was great, they having no Prince, and each City governing it ſelfe; wherein the Pope had alſo a part, becauſe hee had aſſiſted them in theſe laſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17288:9"/>
Warres: Yet for all this the Edict was not eaſily received, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Alexander</hi> the Fourth his ſucceſſor, ſeaven yeares after <hi>vid.</hi> in the yeare 1259. was conſtrained to moderate and renew it, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Inquiſitors nevertheleſſe, with cenſures to force the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors for to obſerve them. For the ſame cauſe <hi>Clement</hi> the Fourth, ſixe yeares after that, <hi>vid.</hi> 1265. did renew it in the ſame manner; yet was it not fully executed, ſo that foure other enſuing Popes were conſtrained to imploy themſelves in over-co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thoſe difficulties; which thwarted them in cauſing the Office to be admitted in ſome places: Theſe difficulties did ariſe from two heads: The one was the undiſcreet ſeverity of the Friers Inquiſitors, their Extortions, and other grievances: The other was becauſe the Commonalties did refuſe to beare the charges: therefore they reſolved to lay downe that pretence, of having the charges borne by the Commonalty. And for to temper the exceſſive rigor of the Inquiſitors, they gave ſome part of Power more unto the Biſhop, which was the cauſe of bringing in the Office with leſſe difficulty into theſe three Provinces of <hi>Lombardye, Romanie,</hi> and <hi>Marca Triviſana,</hi> and afterwards into <hi>Tuſcan;</hi> and ſo it paſſed into <hi>Arragon,</hi> and into ſome Cities of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> it was not brought into the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> by reaſon of the ſmall correſpondency which was betweene the Popes, and the Kings of that Kingdome.</p>
               <p>It was ſoone taken out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> ſome of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors being driven out of thoſe places for their rigors, and extortions; and other ſome going away for want of employment: For which cauſe they were alſo reduced to a ſmall number in <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſince they had not yet penetrated into other Kingdomes of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the yeare 1484. the Catholick King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> having extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the Kingdome of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> in <hi>Granata,</hi> to purge his, and his Wife <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Kingdomes from the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> newly converted, erected with the conſent of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fourth, a Tribunall of the Inquiſition in all his Kingdomes of <hi>Spaine, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> which were by him poſſeſſed, in the forme which it laſteth into this preſent; by which Tribunall are judged, not onely theſe which are accuſed of <hi>Mahometiſme,</hi> or <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> but alſo of Hereſie. The forme which was then brought in, and doth yet laſt, is, that the King nameth an Inquiſitor Generall throughout all his Kingdomes to the Pope, and his Holineſſe doth confirme him; and for the reſt, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is not admitted to entermeddle any further. The Inquiſitor named by the King, and confirmed by the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17288:9"/>
Pope nameth the particular Inquiſitors in every place, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe cannot enter into their charge without the Kings approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The King alſo deputeth a Councell or Senate upon this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in that place where the Court is, of which the ſupreme Inquiſitor is Preſident: and this Counſell hath ſupreame juriſdiction, conſults of all the buſineſſes, makes new Orders when it ſeeth any need; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines differences betweene particular Inquiſitors, puniſheth the defects of the Officers, heareth the appeales, &amp; doth not put them over to any oath: But the King hisroyal Councel, would have the Inquiſition to bee brought into the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp; ſubjected to that of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as alſo in <hi>Sicilio, Sardinia,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Indies:</hi> &amp; the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would have it depending from it, alleadging therefore, beſides the Pontificall ſpirituall Authority, the Temporall ſuperiority which the Pope hath in that Kingdome. In the yeare 1547. <hi>Don Frederico di Toledo</hi> being Vice-roy there, would overcome theſe difficulties and came to execution; which thing excited ſuch a commotion and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition amongſt the people, that it was almoſt growne to a Warre betweene them and the preſidiary <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> getting the Victory, being Maſters of the Forts, the tumult was quieted, and the principals were puniſhed, ſome with death, and ſome with exile: Yet he left off his enterprize of bringing in the Inquiſition, not ſo much for feare of a new tumult, as through the effectuall interceſſion of the Pope and Cardinals; the thought of bringing to paſſe this their intent, remaining ſtill in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> a reſolution to oppoſe it; ſo that to this day there is no Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in all that Kingdome, and if that any caſe happeneth, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched by the Biſhop, or elſe it is delegated from <hi>Rome</hi> to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelate, who notwithſtanding doth nothing unleſſe hee have firſt leave from the Vice-roy. In the Low Countries, ſince the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Sect, the Hereticks were puniſhed by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Magiſtrates, without any other Office of Inquiſition; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with death, ſometimes with baniſhment, which Magiſtrates relenting from their rigor by reaſon of the multitude of Hereticks, in the yeare 1550. the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth reſolved to bring in the Inquiſition after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> manner, and thereupon publiſhed a Decree; but being advertiſed by <hi>Mary</hi> Queene of <hi>Hungary</hi> his Siſter, and Governeſſe of thoſe States, that all the forraigne Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants would bee gone, and the Cities would be without Trafficke, he declared by another Edict, that th' Inquiſition ſhould have no power upon ſtrangers; and for the Natives, he did much mitigate the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17288:10"/>
forme of it, yet was it not put to execution according to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours minde, but onely unperfectly: and the puniſhing of Hereticks for the moſt part reſted in the Magiſtrate, and ſlackned continually more and more: Wherefore <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> tryed in the yeare 1569 and the yeares following, againe the bringing in of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition after divers wayes, but could by no meanes eſtabliſh it by reaſon of divers reſiſtances, till that in the yeare 1567 it was by force of Armes eſtabliſhed by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in, immediatly ſucceeded the Warres, and was ſtill more and more reſtrained, both in ſcope and Authority, untill it was brought to nothing, in which ſtate it remaineth at this preſent.</p>

This inſtitution was juſt the ſame as that which is contained in the Body of the Civill Law, and was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: For firſt, the Cogniſance of the fact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Lai Iudges, deputed by the Commonalty to enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hereticks, who once diſcovered, is to bee Iudged by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops whether their opinion did agree with the true Faith; which done, the Duke and Counſellors made up the ſentence, not as meere executors, but as true Iudges; which plainely appeareth by thoſe words, or by the Major part of them, which words cannot bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of any but ſuch as have decreeing voyces.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, the inſtant requeſts of Pope <hi>Innocent, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> and ſeven other Popes their ſucceſſors; the moſt renowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Common-wealth, could never be perſwaded to receive the Office of Friers Inquiſitors, inſtituted by the Pope. The ſecular ſufficed it, inſtituted by it ſelfe, and brought forth good fruite for Gods Service.</p>
               <p>They had before their eyes the frequent diſorders which were bred, by reaſon of this new Office, in thoſe Cities where it was: becauſe the Friars Inquiſitors often in their Sermons did excite the people, and marking them with croſſes, did worke their revenges upon their enemies under the name of Hereticks, and alſo other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſons were under that name oppreſſed by them, as deſired their goods; one in <hi>Milan</hi> in the yeare 1242. the other in <hi>Parma,</hi> in the yeare 1279. which had like to have beene the ruine of thoſe two Cities; the formall order of this renowned Common-wealth is to hold with old and approved things, and the diſorders of other places did force it to keepe that Office, which by themſelves was Inſtituted in the yeare 1249. as it is ſaid before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:17288:11"/>
But <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Fourth comming to be Pope, being of the order of your <hi>Minor</hi> Friers, hee to bring to paſſe the determinations of his predeceſſors, and to advance the Friers of his owne order, to whom he was greatly affected; did ſo inſtantly entreate that it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to receive the Office, but with ſuch a limitation, that it ſhould not be able to breed any ſcandall; and therefore order was taken, and having called together all the Councels of the Common-wealth, it was determined that the Duke alone ſhould have power, to give ayde to the Inquiſitors, to exerciſe their Office; and that there ſhould be money depoſited out of the common Treaſure, with an over-ſeer who ſhould lay out the expences for the Office, and ſhould receive all the emoluments and profits that ſhould ariſe out of it.</p>
               <p>This determination was ſignified to the Pope with a publicke mandate of the ſaid Counſell, and the Pope having ſeene and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, was content there-with, and did exhort them to follow it. And of all this he framed a Bull given at <hi>Rieti,</hi> the 28. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the ſame yeare 1289. inſerting in it the foreſaid determination of the greater Counſell, made the fourth of the ſame moneth: And this is the beginning in <hi>Venice</hi> of the Office of th 'inquiſition mixed of ſecular and Eccleſiaſticall Perſons, as it continueth to this preſent.</p>
               <p>Heere it is neceſſary to ſtoppe, and conſider that the Office of th' Inquiſition within theſe Dominions, doth not depend from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but properly belonging to the moſt renowned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, undepending, ſet up, and conſtituted by the ſame, and eſtabliſhed by contract and agreement with the Apoſtolick Sea; and therefore ought to bee governed by their owne Cuſtomes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, without being obliged to receive Orders from any other place, whereof there be foure moſt cleere reaſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt becauſe that although <hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth, and other ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Popes made Orders for the eſtabliſhing of the Office of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Inquiſition in every City, yet thoſe orders had no place in this Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, becauſe the Office of the Inquiſition is not inſtituted by vertue of any Popes Bull, but by the determination of the greater Counſell.</p>
               <p>The third, becauſe that Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> did onely give conſent to that which was determined by the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>The fourth, becauſe that the charges, and the profits were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalties, and not the Church-mens; wherefore they, in as much
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17288:11"/>
as belonged to the Office, did depend on the Secular Inſtitutor. The expences which were made were no ſmall matter; for (beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ones for taking men, and the food of Captives) the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor had for his ſtipend twelve Duckets of gold a Month, which now would be above ſixe and thirty Duckets.</p>
               <p>And this truth, that the Office is <hi>Venetian,</hi> and not ſubject to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, appeareth by an accident which happened ſome twelve yeares after the firſt inſtitution of it, <hi>vid.</hi> in the yeare 1301. when Frier <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> Inquiſitor, made a Monitory, unto <hi>Peter Gradenigro,</hi> Duke, that he ſhould ſweare to obſerve the Papall and Imperiall Conſtitutions againſt Hereticks. To whom the Duke anſwered by a publicke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that he was not to take any other oath, ſince that in his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the place he had ſworne to as much as was agreed with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the fourth; neither was he to be tyed to any other Apoſtolicall or Imperiall Ordinances, becauſe they were not conformable to that agreement, and the Inquiſitor withdrew himſelfe from his attempt, and yeelded. I doe not finde when the three Inquiſitors, which were to aſſiſt in the Prince his name, were firſt preferred: But it is likely that they were deputed by him, and the Councellors in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as, well becauſe there being nothing to the contrary remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, it ought to be ſo ſuppoſed: as alſo becauſe that before the erecting of this office of the Inquiſition, mixed of Secular and Eccleſiaſticall; there was theoffice meerely ſecular, to which Noble men were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to inquire againſt Hereticks, as it hath beene above rehearſed; whence it may be preſumed that the election and name continued.</p>

               <head>The Expoſition of the firſt Chapter.</head>
               <p>WHerefore holding this for firme truth, in the firſt Chapter it is ſaid; that as there be three Aſſiſtants to the Office of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition in <hi>Venice,</hi> ſo ought the Rulers aſſiſt in the ſubjected Cities, which ought to be ruled according to the Lawes and cuſtomes of the City which commandeth, unleſſe it be in thoſe particulars, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by priviledge, or the prince his grace, are granted unto each Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And likewiſe the liberties and immunities of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding City, are communicated unto the above named, as ſoone as they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17288:12"/>
enter into that ſubjection: and this is obſerved in all Kingdomes and States. And onely this legall diſpoſition and cuſtome is ſufficient to make lawfull the aſſiſtance of the Rulers, throughout all the Dominion.</p>
               <p>But beſides the legall diſpoſition, there is alſo a particular agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made with the Apoſtolicall Sea in the yeare 1551. The occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which was, that the moſt excellent Councell of Ten, and thoſe joyned with them, having put the Repreſentants in mind of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, leaſt through negligence ſome abuſe might be brought in, writ to all the governours that they ſhould bee preſent to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Proceſſes in the Inquiſition. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> reputed it to be a novelty, with prejudice of the Eccleſiaſticall authority; and Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third complained of it to the Ambaſſadour, ſaying that it was againſt Pontificiall decrees, and that he thereupon would make a Bull. The Ambaſſadour anſwered, that it was not a thing newly determined, but moſt ancient, and renewed to preſerve the juriſdiction, and not to aſſume unto themſelves any part of that which belonged to the Church, but rather to aide it. The Pope was content with the anſwer, &amp; added, if theſe Lords will be Coadjutors, may they be bleſſed, but if they will be co-judges, we cannot endure it. And the Pope reputing it to be a buſineſſe which ought to bee ſounded to the bottome, and not to be contented with words; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeeing the great ſtirre that was amongſt the Cardinals: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent <hi>Achille Graffi,</hi> the Elect of <hi>Montefiaſcone</hi> a purpoſe to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> to whom he gave a Commiſſion the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1551, with theſe words: Wee ſend you to make ſome agreement touching the proceedings in cauſes of Hereſie; it is held, that the Aſſiſtance of the Secular power is neceſſary within that City and Dominion, we doe not diſprove of it, ſo that it be without intruding themſelves into the Cogniſance of ſentence, and a little lower, we will be contented with any forme pleaſing to that Common-wealth, ſo it be <hi>citra cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem &amp; ſententiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The expreſſe Nuntio being come to <hi>Venice,</hi> it was an eaſie matter to accord, becauſe that both the parties did meane the ſame thing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was immediately agreed in foure Articles.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that the Governours ſhall be preſent at the framing of Proceſſes, and to all that which the Inquiſitors or their Deputies ſhall doe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that the Inquiſitors, their Deputies, and Governours, may have liberty to call ſuch Doctors as they ſhall thinke fitting,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17288:12"/>
according to the quality of the caſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that any cauſes happening in Caſtles or Townes, ſhall be diſpatched in the principall City, by the ſame Orders.</p>
               <p>The fourth, that the Governours ſhall once a weeke at leaſt bee with the Inquiſitors and Deputies to attend upon this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Conformablie to this agreement the 26. of <hi>September,</hi> Letters were ſent to all the Governours, and to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope having ſeen this agreement, approved of it, and gave order to the Biſhop of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vello</hi> his ordinary Nuncio in <hi>Venice,</hi> that he ſhould write the ſame to all Inquiſitors and Deputies of the State, warning them alſo that in all Acts, Decrees, and Sentences which ſhould be made in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, in the preſence of Governours, the Notary thereunto deputed ſhould write this clauſe, <hi>vid. Cum aſſiſtentia &amp; preſentia Clariſſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Dominorum. N. N.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt agreement treated of with Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> in the yeare 1289. and this laſt one alſo, each by it ſelfe are ſufficient to ſhew, but both joyned together doe plainlier ſhew, that this authority can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken away by any Bull, or Decree made in any manner by any Pope whatſoever. He that granteth a gift, may upon occaſion revoke it, but that which is covenanted and agreed upon, is irrevocable; ſo that no Decree whatſoever made at <hi>Rome,</hi> ought to ſtirre it, as that which was made by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14. in 1591. declaring that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie being an offence purely Eccleſiaſticall, the Secular power ought not to inter-meddle therein. And although ſome Popes did trye to derrogate from that agreement, as Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth ſaid to that purpoſe: Notwithſtanding any Cuſtomes confirmed by the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Sea, ſuch derogation cannot comprehend our caſe; for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme is one thing, and to covenant and agree is another. And if it ſhould ſay, notwithſtanding the agreements made with the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Sea, it were a Nullity; for it is a contradiction that a thing ſhould be agreed upon betweene two, and that it ſhould be ſubject to the ſentence of one alone. It is certainly to bee beleeved, that the Court will ſtill try by all meanes to exclude the Secular, and draw wholly under itſelfe the Offices concerning Hereſie, which are in this State. But no act of any other can bring it in queſtion, or cauſe any prejudice: ſo that the prejudices doe not come from this ſide through negligence in the Execution. Wherein we may take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from <hi>Spaine;</hi> where the forme of the Inquiſition being ſubject to the King, eſtabliſhed by an agreement made in the yeare 1484. the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17288:13"/>
                  <hi>Spaniards</hi> have refuſed to have it altered by any Bull or Order made at <hi>Rome.</hi> It was not an act of great honeſty when they printed the <hi>Directory</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the yeare 1584. to adde unto it the aforeſaid briefe of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, directed to all Biſhops and Inquiſitors within this Dominion: wherein (upon ſome notable caſes which happened in <hi>Valcamonica)</hi> that Pope writ, that the Secular Magiſtrate ſhall have nothing to doe with the office of the Inquiſition, and ſhall be onely tyed to execute the ſentence, without any other buſineſſe; which briefe they ought not by any meanes have printed. Firſt, becauſe they had it not out of an authenticall place. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at that time it was not put in execution, nor peradventure ſeen, whereof a manifeſt token is, that the ſaid Briefe being Dated the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> 1521. after the Roman manner, ſome thirty, dayes after, <hi>vid.</hi> the twentieth, and foure and twentieth of <hi>March</hi> the moſt excellent Councell of Ten (to reſiſt the innumerable extortions done by the Clergy) ordered, that notwithſtanding the Sentences pronounced by the Inquiſition Office, the Biſhop of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> with two Doctors deputed by the Governours, the Proceſſes ſhould be new made, and carryed to <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and there judged in the preſence of the Governours: Whereunto the Nuntio alſo conſented, and ſo it was accompliſhed; which ſheweth us plainly, that the ſaid Briefs of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, either is not true, or is not to be ſeene, or did not take place, and therefore ought not to be printed, eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the agreement made with <hi>Iulius</hi> was ſince that time. But as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> will never deſiſt from nouriſhing her pretence, ſo it ſhal be fitting to watch for to reſiſt, that negligence may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the buſineſſe, never putting to a treaty a thing already ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed: becauſe the very putting of it to a Treaty in the yeare 1551. if the ſucceſſe had not beene good as it was, would have beene a great prejudice to the agreement made in 1289. But that beſides the lawfulneſſe and righteouſneſſe of this ſentence, it is alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with skill to preſerve it; both private and publicke reſpects doe manifeſtly ſhew: For the power which God giveth the Prince, is not a gift given for his uſe alone, which he may let fall to decay without ſinne, but though it commeth immediately from God, yet is it given for the peoples benefit, ſo that if it be diminiſhed, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines not ſo ſufficient for the good and entire government, and the ſubject receiveth wrong, and the Divine Majeſty is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>Although the Prince is not bound to his Subject to governe him,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17288:13"/>
yet to God hee is, and the protection which hee hath of him, though towards the ſubject it be a favour, yet towards God it is a duty, which cannot be performed, without preſerving whole, and not ſuffering to be abated the publicke Authority. The Office of the Inquiſition as it is more holy and needfull than others; ſo (if it bee not well handled but abuſed) it, is more burthenous and hurtfull: Where it is in the hands of juſt and prudent Church-men, they ſhould be incouraged to continue ſo, by looking to them and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of them, for the opportunity of having power to worke after ones owne fancy may cauſe a Saint to over-runne his courſe: But where the adminiſterer hath all his requiſite qualities, it is neceſſary to withſtand his exceſſes. In times paſt it hath beene ſeene that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have beene burthened with exceſſive rigours, by thoſe who under a ſhew of zeale, have ſought to make way for their ambition, or to get unto themſelves that which belonged to others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is needfull to marke, that avarice or ambition ſhould hurt no particular, but a good Father, and of a good conſcience ſhould ſeeke a remedy for it: the indiſcreet zeale which ſhe cauſeth to bee in perſons that are not converſant in worldly affaires, hath neede of ſuch a bridle. In publicke affaires alſo, the effects of ambition ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or indiſcretion are no leſſe dangerous, for when a Potentate hath not the favour of him that commands in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, Religion is made a pretext to oppreſſe him. In the yeare 1322. Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. publiſhed a ſevere monitory againſt <hi>Mathew,</hi> Vicount, Lord of <hi>Milan,</hi> condemning him of Hereſie, and under this pretence commanding the moſt famous Common-wealth, that it ſhould hold no commerce with him, nor with his ſubjects, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had no other cauſe againſt the Vicount, but that he tooke part with <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> Emperour, the Popes enemy: And the ſame yeare, the moſt Reverend <hi>Guido, Rangoni</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and Frier <hi>Buono</hi> Inquiſitor, did admoniſh the moſt renowned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: that there ſhould be no commerce held with <hi>Rinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and <hi>Obizo de Eſte,</hi> or their adherents and ſubjects, becauſe they had condemned them for Hereticks: neither was there any other cauſe but that they had recovered <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which was poſſeſſed by the Popes. In the yeare 1355. <hi>Malateſta,</hi> and <hi>Galeotto Malteſti,</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the City of <hi>Rimini,</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſixt, commanded <hi>Venice,</hi> that no commerce ſhould be held with them, or with their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, becauſe he ſuſpected them to be Hereticks. The ſame Pope the ſame yeare, uſed the ſame manner with the moſt famous Common-wealth,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17288:14"/>
againſt <hi>Franciſco Ordelafo,</hi> by reaſon of the Dominion of <hi>Forli,</hi> and <hi>Gulielmo Manfredi,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Faenza,</hi> cauſed alſo the Crociata to be preached againſt them. Yet all theſe great ſtirres and condemnations of Hereſie vaniſhed into ſmoake, ſo ſoone as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed were contented to acknowledge thoſe Lands held in diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Pope; A cleare and undoubted document to ſhew us, that the imputation of Hereſie was but onely to oppreſſe them, and perforce bring them to yeeld to the fore deſigned humane changes.</p>
               <p>But to come to Moderne things, In the diſcords which <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth had with King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which were of temporall buſineſſes: That Pope as well in conſiſtory, as treating with Ambaſſadors of Princes, alwayes was wont to ſay, and reply that the King, and the Emperour his Father were Hereticks. It was alſo ſeene in theſe late occaſions, that thoſe Bookes which were writ in favour of the moſt renowned Common-wealths cauſe, were forbidden by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Inquiſition, and others ofth 'Eccleſiaſticall State, under the colour of Hereſie, although the things treated of were meerely temporall, and approved by all Chriſtian Kingdomes: And Cardinall <hi>Bellarmin</hi> having ſome yeares ſince ſet forth a booke, wherein he ſubjects Princes to the Pope in temporall affaires; hee dares therein handle as Hereticks, all thoſe who ſay that the Prince in temporall Cauſes, hath no other ſuperior but God onely; although that foure of the five parts of Catholicks doe beleeve it: Which things cauſe us to beleeve, that ſince ſome mens malice doe make uſe of this Office for humane ends, which are not very honeſt; it is needfull to looke how it is uſed, and not ſuffer them to take ſuch foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whereby they may abuſe it: Becauſe then upon occaſion, when one would take order therein, it is found to be too late.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Milan</hi> where the Inquiſition hath great Authority, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about 1580, a dangerous caſe. Cardinall <hi>Boromeo</hi> (who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was a Saint) viſiting of ſome places of the Dioceſſe of <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſubject to the <hi>Suiſſers,</hi> went ordering many things, which bred ſome ſuſpitions in thoſe States; wherefore they ſent an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Milan,</hi> to require the Governour to cauſe the Cardinall to come backe from thoſe places, leaſt ſome alteration ſhould happen. The Ambaſſadour went to <hi>Milan</hi> and alighted at a Merchants houſe, that he might the more commodiouſly goe and doe his Ambaſſage. The Inquiſitor heard of it, and immediatly went with his Officers and carried him bound to Priſon to his covent. The Merchant repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17288:14"/>
what had happened to the Governour, who preſently cauſed the Ambaſſadour to be ſet at liberty, honoured him, and heard him. The <hi>Swiſſers</hi> who had no ſooner notice of impriſonment then of his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſaid openly, that if the newes of his impriſonment had come alone without that of his deliverance, they would have impriſoned the Cardinall, to whom the Governour ſent word of what was done; The Cardinall yeelding to neceſſity went away, and the new inventions were revoked.</p>
               <p>Theſe dangers ſhew that not onely malice may cauſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but impudency alſo, and undiſcreet zeale: Therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth to watch carefully, that the power of meeting at all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Office be not diminiſhed, which God by his Providence hath hitherto preſerved, and by which meanes all publicke dangers and oppreſſions of the Subjects may be withſtood.</p>
               <p>It beeing then plainely ſhewne that the Office of the Inquiſition is not ancient in Holy Church, and that within this Dominion it was inſtituted in the ſame forme as it is now uſed by the Common-wealth it ſelfe, as an Office properly belonging to it; and eſtabliſhed by agreement with the Apoſtolicke Sea: and the reaſons being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded which did move to this deliberation, and the neceſſity which bindeth to keepe inviolated the forme alwayes eſtabliſhed, With theſe conſiderations the grounds of the firſt Chapter are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently unfolded and proved.</p>

               <p>But grant that no Inquiſitor ſhould exceed the bounds of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, yet that is not ſo well ordered, but that it is needfull to guide it with a great deale of wiſedome. To make this appeare it ſhall ſuffice to underſtand what was Printed, in the Directorie in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the yeare 1584. which is orderly Tranſlated out of the Latin. If the Inquiſitors would uſe all the Command they have within their power, they might eaſily raiſe ſeditions every where: And theſe words are written purpoſely to admoniſh Inquiſitors; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a thing ſhall ſeeme juſt unto them, yet when it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous they ought to take advice from <hi>Rome.</hi> But here wee muſt not conclude ſo, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> being farre, and buſied in her owne affaires, cannot well judge of others dangers. But theſe confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhew it to bee neceſſary for all that will keepe their Dominions in peace, and protect their Subjects, to have a diligent regard, and cunningly moderate that power, which in it ſelfe is confeſſed to be exorbitant, and many times chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to be exceeded and abuſed.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1518. there were a great number of Enchanters diſcovered in <hi>Valcamonica,</hi> and by the little care of the Governors of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> the judging of them was left to the cenſure of Church-men. Thence grew ſuch exorbitant extortions, and complaints of the oppreſſed, that the moſt excellent Counſell of Ten was forced to diſanull all that which they had done, and ſend for all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17288:15"/>
Vicars, and Inquiſitors to <hi>Venice,</hi> and cauſe all thoſe buſineſſes to be reviewed by the other Iudges, with the Aſſiſtance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: yet for all that was that people hardly pacified from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Sedition.</p>
               <p>The extream ſeditions raiſed in <hi>Rome</hi> after the death of <hi>Paul</hi> the 4 are not yet out of memory, wherein the Priſons of the Inquiſition were by the people broken, and the building with all the writings bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And likewiſe the danger the City of <hi>Mantua</hi> was in, the yeare 1568. which thing it is impoſſible to hinder, if the Magiſtrate, whoſe charge it is to looke to the repoſe of the City, doe not ſtoppe exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and headlong determinations. And if upon any doubtfull, or dangerous buſineſſe he cauſeth a ſtay, it cannot be thought a prejudice to the Eccleſiaſticall, ſince by ſurceaſing they may the better delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and that hindreth not the buſineſſe from being atchieved with greater maturity. Whereas if a dangerous caſe ſhould bee ſuffered to runne on, and the event ſhould prove evill, either it could not be remedied, or not wholly, The Prince advertiſed thereof, may either by his owne authority, or by ſending to the Pope, paſſe over ſome things with quietneſſe, which without his knowledge would have but a bad iſſue.</p>
               <p>That fourth part of the Chapter. <hi>vid.</hi> that the Rectors and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſhall with dexterity egge on the Inquiſitors to execute their office, if they were negligent therein, is moſt proper to the Secular Magiſtrate. Firſt, by St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> reaſon who ſaith, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to their office to puniſh offences which are immediately againſt the Divine Majeſty, as blaſphemies, Hereſies, and Perjuries, more than thoſe who offend men. And beſides that, becauſe Hereſie doth not onely offend God, but bring notable diſturbances to the publicke peace, the care of which reſting upon the Magiſtrate, who is chiefe in the City, he cannot let it runne in danger of being infected, but he muſt faile in his duty. The Inquiſitors ought to looke to keepe the people cleane from Hereſies, for Gods ſervice onely. The Magiſtrate both for Gods ſervice, and for the good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke government; and therefore as one, on whom the care moſt lyeth, he alſo ought moſt to watch, and to incite others: Neither can any one oppoſe this, by ſaying that Secular men, though they be Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, yea, and Princes alſo are the Children, and Eccleſiaſtical perſons are the Fathers, and that it is not fitting that the Child ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to controule and admoniſh the Father, for the equivocation and cavill is manifeſtly ſeene in it. In a City there is a Sonne, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17288:16"/>
is a chiefe Magiſtrate, hee in houſhold and Domeſticke buſineſſes ſhall be ſubject to his Father, but in publicke and Civill buſineſſes he ſhall be ſuperiour. Eccleſiaſticall Perſons are Fathers in Chriſt, ſo that a Magiſtrate ought to be ſubject unto them in houſhold things, which belong to the Houſe of God, and from them to receive the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the Divine Sacraments, which are houſhold things, in which the Sonne is ſubject to the ſpirituall Father. But in publicke buſineſſes, as puniſhing of offences, and peaceable civill living, Spirituall Fathers are ſubject to the Sonne who hath the charge of it, as he is a publicke Magiſtrate. And if an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call man hath any power or juriſdiction to puniſh any offence, he hath it from none but the Prince, to whom onely God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid before, that in a Judgement there are three parts, the Cogniſance of the reaſon, <hi>vid.</hi> which doings are Hereticall, and this is purely Eccleſiaſticall; the Cogniſance of the Fact, <hi>vid.</hi> what perſons are guilty, and the ſentence: theſe two laſt are temporall, and in former times under the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, exerciſed by the Secular power, and now loſt. There are alſo left to Eccleſiaſticall perſons by the grant of Princes, the moſt renowned Common-wealth, which did exerciſe that power from the yeare 1249. untill 1289. that yeare granted it to the Inquiſition office, managed by Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but with Secular aſſiſtance: If Eccleſiaſticall perſons ſhould faile in their duties, the power would returne to him who gave it, without depriving himſelfe of it. Wherefore it is no wonder if the Secular Perſon ought to be an over-ſeer of him that exerciſeth a charge which he hath given him, in admoniſhing and egging him on as farre as it ſhall be decent for them both.</p>

               <head>The Expoſition of the fifth Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe fifth Chapter, that the Governours and Aſſiſtants ſhall not ſweare faithfulneſſe, nor ſecreſie to the Inquiſitor, is highly to be conſidered of, ſince that by ſuch an oath they ſhould ceaſe from being repreſentants of the Prince his perſon, and become the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:17288:16"/>
It is cleare, that whoſoever ſweares faithfulneſſe, or ſecreſie, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially without exception, is bound to performe it to him that he hath ſworne it, not regarding any other mans intereſts; ſo that the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentant could not oppoſe himſelfe againſt any act of the Inquiſition, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were contrary to the Princes reſpects, nor give him notice of things happening in that office, without breaking his Oath. But the publicke repreſentant, even when things are treated of that doe belong to the Inquiſition Office, muſt not aime at any reſpects or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but onely the Princes: wherefore he cannot ſweare faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or ſecreſie to others.</p>
               <p>Where the Inquiſitions Tribunal is meerely Eccleſiaſticall, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men doe come in as Councellors, or ſometimes Fiſcals, or Notaries, or other Officers, which doe ſweare to the Inquiſitor. But that is becauſe thoſe Secular men which are ſo preſent, are dependants, and ſubject to the Eccleſiaſticall. Now in this ſtate the Tribunal is mixt, not for Secular Councellors, or other Officers, but onely for the Repreſentants publicke aſſiſters, who depend not from the Eccleſiaſticall, but are ſuperintendents in the Princes ſtead.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſticals for theſe many hundred yeares, have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aime, but to uſurpe the temporall juriſdiction, and have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a great deale of it with great diſturbance of ſundry govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and at this preſent they aime at it more than ever, and in particular, for the Inquiſition in this State and Common-wealth, they doe bend themſelves with all their cunning to draw it to bee wholly Eccleſiaſticall, which they would at laſt bring to paſſe, if they could bring in this Oath, making thereby the Repreſentant their Officer. And this being once brought to paſſe, the ſeruples of the one, and the ſmall underſtanding of the other, the Offices which would be done by meanes of the Confeſſors, would worke ſo, that <hi>Romes</hi> and the Inquiſitions ends, would be preferred to the publicke ends, or at leaſt would raiſe ſuch powerfull doubts in the minde, that they would never let any thing be well done: which voydeth alſo an anſwer that ſeemes might be given, <hi>vid.</hi> That the Oath might be received, reſerving to the Prince his ends. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which taketh not away the dangers: For the aforeſaid things would ſo trouble the mindes of men, that they would never give way to the ſound underſtanding of it. But to colour their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, the Inquiſitors ſay two things: One, that <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cond, commanded all Conſuls and Governours of Cities to ſweare
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17288:17"/>
The other that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſweares. But <hi>Fredericke</hi> did not command that they ſhould ſweare to the Inquiſitors, for (as wee have ſhewed before) the Office of the Inquiſition was not then begun, but that they ſhould ſweare in publicke to him, to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in rooting out of Hereſies, which had taken roote. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Governors did not then goe into the Office of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with Eccleſiaſticall Perſons, but they alone with the Imperiall Authority did condemne Hereticks, and ſwore to the Emperour to doe it faithfully: and beſides, this forme laſted but a little while, and <hi>Iohn Andrew,</hi> a famous Canoniſt, who flouriſhed in the yeare 1300. witneſſeth, that in his time that Oath was already growne out of cuſtome. <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> brought in the cuſtome of taking a publicke Oath, (not to the Inquiſitors but to God) that hee would never ſuffer Hereticks to live at freedome within his Dominions, which is no Oath of faithfulneſſe and ſecreſie to the Office (which depends on the King, and is commanded by him) but a promiſe to God, and a taking away all hope from the Subjects of obtaining from him any liberty of Conſcience. In the ſame manner the ancient Dukes of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Common-wealth at their promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did ſweare to puniſh Hereticks; but it was not an Oath to the Inquiſitor, but to God and the Common-wealth. The equivocation conſiſts in this, that it is one thing to ſweare abſolutely, and another to ſweare to ſuch a one, and this is that which ſignifieth ſubjection to him that giveth the Oath. The publicke repreſentant can not ſweare to any but to the Prince, as hee cannot be ſubject to any one elſe. For which reaſons it ſhall alwayes be neceſſary, to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this fifth Chapter, not as a ſummary point, but a point of great importance.</p>

               <head>The Expoſition of the ſixth Chapter.</head>
               <p>TO give the Prince notice of what happeneth daily in matters of Hereſie, as it is contained in the ſixt Chapter; is a thing of Divine Service, and neceſſary to a good Government, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17288:17"/>
is in the hands of Eccleſiaſticall Perſons onely, they doe not ſuffer the Prince to know any thing that is done in that Office. In this State where the Iudgement is mixed, as their aime is that the Aſſiſtant (ſince they cannot exclude him) ſhould become their Officer, ſo they uſe their beſt endeavours to make him keepe ſecret what is treated off, making it a charge of Conſcience if any thing be revealed without the Inquiſitors leave: With this maxime, that cauſes touching Faith, muſt remaine with the Iudges of the Faith.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other perverſe Opinions which this our unhappy Age is full of, this is alſo preached, that the care of Religion doth not belong to the Prince, which Opinion is coloured with two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; the one that ſince it is a ſpirituall and Divine thing, it belongeth not to Temporall Authority: the other becauſe the Prince occupied in greater buſineſſes, cannot attend theſe affaires. And certainely it is a thing to bee admired, how the world is changed: In other times holy Biſhops did not preach, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend any thing more to Princes, than the care of Religion; they warned them of nothing, nor modeſtly rebuke them for any thing, more than for the careleſneſſe in it, and now nothing is more preached too or perſwaded. The Prince then, that to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not the charge of Divine things, though contrarywiſe the Holy Scripture bee full of places where Religion is recommended to the protection of Princes, by the Divine Majeſty; which alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth peace, and proſperity to thoſe States where Piety is favoured, and deſolation and deſtruction threatned to thoſe States, where Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things are held as alien. Examples thereof doe abound, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Treaty will not ſuffer a long rehearſall of them, I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that <hi>David</hi> being entred into a Kingdome out of order both internally, and externally, and being very buſie both in Warres and in framing a politick Government; nevertheleſſe did ſet his chiefe care on matters of religion. <hi>Salomon</hi> entring into a quiet and exceeding well ordered Kingdome, regarded alſo Religion, more than any other part of Government: The Princes moſt applauded in former Ages, as <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Charlemaine,</hi> St. <hi>Lewis, &amp;c.</hi> The chiefeſt praiſe they had was, to have made it their chiefe travaile to protect and rule the affaires of the Church. It is a great deceite to ſet forth this part as a thing of leſſe moment, and to bee left out for to looke to other things: Since the neglect of this to provoake the Divine Wrath, daily experience in theſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17288:18"/>
dayes ſheweth us, that a State cannot ſtand untroubled, where change of Religion commeth: And theſe which counſell Princes to not meddle with Church buſineſſes, ſay nevertheleſſe upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, that true Religion is the foundation of States. It were a great abſurdity holding this to be true, as, it is moſt true, to leave the totall care of it to others; under pretence that they are ſpirituall, where Temporall Authority will not reach; or that a Prince hath any greater imployment than this. It is manifeſt, that as the Prince is not a Praetor, nor a Prefect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor a Proveditore; So likewiſe hee is no Prieſt, nor no Inquiſitor: But it is alſo certaine, that hee is to over-ſee with keeping in awe, and cauſing to doe their duties both the one and the other. And here lyeth the deceite, that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care of Religion, is proper to the Officers of the Church, as the Government of Temporall things is proper to the Magiſtrate, and the Prince himſelfe ought to doe neither the one nor the other; but is to direct all, and to take heede that none doe faile in his Office, and to amend the defects of Officers: this being the Prince his charge as well in matters of Religion, as in any other part of the Government. And as in other matters for to manage well that part which is proper unto him, hee is to bee informed of all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: So ought he particularly to bee advertiſed of all that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in matter of Religion. The Inquiſitors of <hi>Italy</hi> doe particularly ſend word to <hi>Rome</hi> by every Poſt, what is done within their Office; much more ought an account bee given to the Prince, whom it more concernes to know it. It were very expedient, that all things which are treated off within the State, ſhould remaine therein; as it is obſerved in <hi>Spaine,</hi> which give account to the King onely; and ſend advice no where elſe. But becauſe that were a hard thing to obtaine, let it for this time ſuffice, that it bee knowne to the Prince, when it is knowne to others, who are not ſo much intereſted therein.</p>

               <p>THe ninth Chapter that the aſſiſtants ſhould aſſiſt to the Iudgment, although the guilty were Eccleſiaſticall, is a legall poſition and neceſſary to be obſerved. It is not credible that the Secular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in that Office was brought in, in regard of the Perſons of the queſtioned, this in times paſt hath deceived many who were perſwaded the Perſon of the queſtioned appointeth the place of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, miſ-underſtanding that Maxime, <hi>Actor ſequitur forum rei,</hi> which is meant of private intereſt, where tryall is to bee betweene two parties, which their Perſons be not both ſubject to one Iudge, the judgement place ſhall bee before him to whom the Defendant is ſubject: But where there is no private intereſt but a publicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the Perſon is not looked after, but the cauſe: and though the Perſon bee Secular, yet if the Cauſe bee Eccleſiaſticall, the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Iudge ſhall judge it: So in theſe daies, Matrimoniall Cauſes are eſteemed to be Eccleſiaſticall, and therefore though the Perſon bee Secular, yet are the Cauſes Iudged by the Biſhops. So Cauſes that are purely Secular, as the adminiſtration of publicke Offices, Cauſes of plenty, of health; offences which trouble the publicke reſt, doe belong unto the Secular power, although the Perſons bee Eccleſiaſticall. If the offence be mixt, there is a mixt Magiſtrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, to whom without attending the quality of the Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to judge all matters of that kind. And becauſe that Hereſie doth corrupt true Chriſtian Doctrine, it is an Eccleſiaſticall offence; and becauſe it diſturbeth the publicke reſt, it is Secular: therefore there is a mixt Iudgement Seate appointed, with an Eccleſiaſticall judge, and a Secular Aſſiſtant: And in the practice of it, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect had of the queſtioned Perſon, for then the Eccleſiaſticall ſhould Iudge the Prieſts and the Friars, and the Magiſtrate ſhould Iudge Secular men: But the Hereſie of the Secular man is as much againſt the Catholicke Doctrine, as that of a Clarke; and a Hereticke Prieſt, or Frier troubleth the publicke Government as much, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17288:20"/>
peradventure more than a Secular one. And as the Secular office ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted concerning Corporall health; and if it finde an Eccleſiaſtical perſon bringing in of infected goods, he doth not put over the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tothe Eccleſiaſtical judge, but burneth the goods, &amp; packeth away the ſuſpected perſon, becauſe the publick temporall good is in ueſtion: ſo the mixt office of the Inquiſition doth not put over an Ecleſiaſticall Perſon, but judgeth it, becauſe that the publicke good, both ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and temporall is treated of. And this is further confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that though offences committed by Regular Friers are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by their owne ſuperiours, yet they cannot entermeddle in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Hereſie, but goe to the Inquiſition without regarding that the perſon is a regular. It is yet made more manifeſt in that, that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Hereſie, being more againſt Eccleſiaſticall Perſons, than Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ones, in the agreements made with the Apoſtolicall Sea, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the yeare 1551. they of <hi>Rome</hi> would have made that excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being not made, ſhewes that they have not held the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rule, <hi>vid.</hi> that the Secular ſhould meete in all caſes. This ninth Chapter, beſides that the juſtice of it requires the keeping of it, ought alſo for divers other reſpects with all diligence be put in execution. Firſt, becauſe we have ſhewed above, how neceſſary it is to a good government, to have the Prince know of all occuren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that happen in ſuch matters, for the great importance of maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion. But if the Aſſiſtant ſhould not meet at judgements againſt Eccleſiaſticall Perſons (and theſe are the moſt important, moſt dangerous, and moſt frequent) then the ſtate of Religion within his Dominion ſhould not be knowne, which would be moſt abſurd. Secondly, ſeldome happeneth a caſe of Hereſie in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall perſon, but a Secular is a confederate in it, in which caſe one would not know what to doe; for to divide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the cauſe it is impoſſible, to leave a Secular perſon to a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meerely Eccleſiaſticall is more unfitting. There remaines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then but to have it judged before the ordinary mixed Tribunal: and queſtionleſſe if this way were once given, under divers colours of annexed, connexed, dependent, and emergent, the Secular would be altogether excluded. Therefore according to reaſon, the moſt wiſe determination of the Senate named in this Chapter, ought to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>For proofe of the ſecond part, <hi>vid.</hi> that the Aſſiſtants ſhall bee preſent at the framing of Proceſſes, though the Denunciations be given in other places, we muſt ſuppoſe the ſtile of that office to be approved by continuall cuſtome, and alſo by reaſon. For if a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17288:20"/>
perſon be denounced at the Tribunall of the Inquiſition, who hath his dwelling in another place, and that he be not perſonally under that juriſdiction, the Inquiſior receives the Denuntiation, examines the Witneſſes, and frames the Proceſſe, as farre as may be done in that place, and ſo framed, he ſendeth it to the Inquiſitor of the place, where the delinquent liveth, that the cauſe may be proſecuted, and he diſpatched.</p>
               <p>It happened in the Yeare 1610. that Father <hi>Avaroldo,</hi> a <hi>Capuchine</hi> was denounced at <hi>Rome</hi> for a certain opinion concerning Antichriſt, and from that Inquiſition was the Proceſſe ſent to <hi>Breſcia,</hi> where the Father was. The Inquiſition of <hi>Breſcia</hi> proceeded in the cauſe without the Aſſiſtance, and anſwered the Governours (who hearing the event did finde themſelves agrieved with it) that the Governours ought not to aſſiſt, but onely in cauſes which were begun at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Tribunal, but not when the Denunciation was given at <hi>Rome.</hi> If this were admitted, it would not onely be againſt reaſon, and the lawfull cuſtome, but it would alſo be a ſecret to take away quite, and with eaſe the Aſſiſtance. The Inquiſitors to take away that bond of having Aſſiſtants, to increaſe their owne authority, and to doe the better ſervice to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> would worke with the Denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, under faire and appearing colours, that the Denuntiation ſhould not be given into that office, but at <hi>Rome,</hi> which would be eaſie, being content to doe it either by Letter, or Petition; and in this manner, in all cauſes the Secular ſhould bee excluded. But the legall definition is, that as every office or Inquiſition receives De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiations againſt the abſent, according to their owne Rites, Formes, and Cuſtomes, ſo the proper office frames the Proceſſe, and gives ſentence according to his. It was needfull to take notice of this particular, for feare leaſt any deceived with ſhewes, ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away to a publicke prejudice, it being to be held for an infallible rule, that the publicke repreſentant muſt aſſiſt to every act done in that office without any exception.</p>

               <p>THe fifteenth Chapter, that in the Proceſſe there ſhall be no Decrees inſerted by any forraigne authority ought to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely obſerved: For moſt part of the Inquiſitions out of this State are reduced to ſuch a forme of proceeding, that the Inquiſitors doe every foote write to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence receive orders what they ſhall doe, ſo that at laſt it is as good as if the Proceſſe were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſo they free themſelves of the bond impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Canon Law to conſult of their affaires. In this State they have not yet attempted this frequent and ſubtle abuſe, but onely in ſome particular caſe, to favour, or disfavour ſome one. It may be thought they write to <hi>Rome</hi> for Juſtice, or for ſome good intent, whence they receive orders of what they will have done; and the Inquiſitors to curry favour with a ready obedience, put it to execution: and they themſelves will ſometimes, to avoyde ſome contradictions of the Biſhops Vicar, or ſome Councellors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> and by that meanes overcome the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This produceth two evill effects, the one that it taketh away the authority of that Tribunal, making it ſubject to him to whom by reaſon it ought not to be. The other, that he who is queſtioned is at more trouble, and more coſt in defending himſelfe. The moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Senate hath alwayes endeavoured that the authority of their Inquiſition office ſhould not be diminiſhed, being as requiſite for a good government as any other publicke ordinance. In <hi>Rome</hi> the Inquiſition was not above that of other places, but applyed it ſelfe onely to that City, as others did in their Cities. The Pope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was ſuperintendent and overſeer of them all, maintaining nevertheleſſe the agreements, immunities, and lawfull cuſtomes of every one, and ſo it continued untill <hi>Paul</hi> the third, who did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Congregation of Cardinals in <hi>Rome,</hi> giving them the Title of Inquiſitors Generall, who nevertheleſſe doe not command the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which by agreement was firſt inſtituted: So
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17288:23"/>
likewiſe they ought not to take away the authority of this States In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition: alſo inſtituted by agreement ſome hundred yeares ſince. Which thing I have conſidered for to conclude, that it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that Inquiſition ſhould take that which belongeth unto this. And in effect if the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Inquiſition ſhould meddle with thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are handled within this ſtate, as it doth in other places, it would be as much as to reduce them all to <hi>Rome.</hi> And to ſpeake in plaine and reſtrained tearmes, as by Law every act which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors make, without the Aſſiſtance, are voyd, ſo thoſe Acts cannot be of force which are made out of the State, being made without the preſence of the Aſſiſtants.</p>
               <p>And if thoſe Cardinals ſhould be ſent by the Pope as Inquiſitors into this State, they would not be ſuffered to doe any thing without the Magiſtrates preſence, and that which were ſo done, would be voyd, much leſſe ſhould they have leave to doe it at <hi>Rome.</hi> That hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not, but if that Congregation, as conſiſting of principall Cardinals, ſhould write any thing: But that thoſe Letters ſhould be received by the Inquiſitors with all due reverence, executing alſo that which they deſire, ſo there were not ſome powerfull rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the contrary, but alwayes it ſhould bee done obſerving the Stile of the Office, that is, framing the Decree in the name of the proper Judges with the Aſſiſtance, not mentioning in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe that it was done by order from elſe where. And if that particular Writing from <hi>Rome</hi> were not agreeeable to the cuſtomes of the Countrey, and the particular circumſtances which ought to be looked upon, and ſhould ſeeme ſo to the Iudges, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſulters, it will not bee incongruous to reply to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Aſſiſtants notwithſtanding ought not to meddle with this, neither are they to know whether any Order come or no from <hi>Rome,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is required from <hi>Rome,</hi> be put, or not put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely to aſſiſt to what the Inquiſitors doe, not uſing any other name but that of their owne office.</p>

               <head>The Expoſition of the ſixteenth Chapter.</head>
               <p>THis ſixteenth Chapter, in that part which toucheth the not ſending Priſoners out of the State, is clearer than the light; ſince Priſoners are tranſmitted out of one place into another either for Execution, when both places are within one Prince his Dominions, or from Prince to Prince by agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, or for gratification; and in all theſe caſes the Tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made onely, becauſe offenders ſhould be puniſhed in the place where the offence is committed. But in caſe of Hereſie, the Doctors ſay that the puniſhment cannot with reaſon be required in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place, as well becauſe the Heretick ſinneth againſt God who is every where, and alſo becauſe that whereſoever he goeth holding his perverſneſſe, in all thoſe places hee ſinneth; wherefore in what place ſo ever he is puniſhed, hee ſhall be ſaid to be puniſhed in the place where he offended. On this reaſon is grounded the common opinion, that thoſe who are guilty of Hereſie, are not to be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and indeed, the cuſtome is every where to puniſh Hereticks where they are reſtrained, and not to ſend them from one Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to another. Onely the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> for her owne intereſts, eaſily, and often doth call unto it ſelfe the cauſes, and cauſeth the Priſoners to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> though the offence have not beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in that City.</p>
               <p>The moſt renowned Common-wealth, as it hath not conſented to the drawing away of Cauſes, ſo hath it not granted the tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Priſoners; but hath determined that they ſhould be judged where they are impriſoned: it being certaine that in doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they ſhould utterly take away all the Authority of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-office in their Dominion, within which there being Biſhops, who in goodneſſe and worth are inferiour to no other, and Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors deputed by the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, and the Cities abounding with learned men, who may be received for conſulters, there is no reaſon but that any caſe may be as well examined and decided there,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17288:24"/>
as in any other City whatſoever. If it were to doe God greater ſervice, that Priſoners ſhould be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> it were fit that, throwing all other reſpects to the ground, this onely onely ſhould be aimed at: but to ſhew that it is not ſo, I will onely bring one example which happened heretofore, in the yeare 1596. at the inſtance of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was impriſoned in <hi>Padua</hi> one <hi>Ludovico Petrucci,</hi> a Seneſe, and the Inquiſitor of <hi>Rome,</hi> being according to the cuſtome of the Inquiſition, to ſend thoſe Evidences which he had againſt him to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi> he required the contrary, <hi>vid.</hi> that the Priſoner ſhould be ſent thither, and to that effect uſed many perſwaſions to the Ambaſſadour which was in <hi>Rome,</hi> and cauſed many to be uſed by the <hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Venice.</hi> The moſt excellent Senate anſwered divers times to this effect, that it was not convenient to alter the excellent Inſtitution of this Dominion, which was to diſpatch queſtioned Priſoners, where they were reſtrained: that on the other ſide, for the Inquiſitor to ſend to <hi>Padua,</hi> what was found againſt the Priſoner, that ſo he might receive due puniſhment was a thing juſt, uſuall, and without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Many were the replyes and the anſwers alwayes to one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and theſe dealings laſted five whole yeares, <hi>Petruccio</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill in Priſon, At laſt, when they perceived at <hi>Rome</hi> that they could not obtaine him, in the yeare 1601. they writ to <hi>Padua,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Petruccio</hi> ſhould without any more a doe bee ſet at liberty, which was accordingly, leaving a great doubt in mens mindes what offence that might be, which was rather to be left unpuniſhed, than made knowne to the Inquiſition of <hi>Padua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Accident which happened, I will adde what the Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Inquiſitors ſpeakes of the cauſes of the Inquiſition, which are handled in that Court: of which ſpeaking, after it had related divers inconveniences, it concludes: In this Court Cauſes are handled with much tediouſneſſe, many miſeries, labours, and expences, inſomuch that thoſe which are queſtioned, care not for comming to the Court, to treate of their Cauſes, if they doe not rruſt to a full purſe, or to great favours. Theſe are the words of the Directory; it is credible that Juſtice is adminiſtred with greater ſincerity now then it was in thoſe dayes: but there withall it is to be held for a certaine, that there is no leſſe goodneſſe and ſufficiency within this State, and that Cauſes may as juſtly and as rightly be handled here, as in any other place, ſo that it is not needfull to let them be judged elſe where, who are impriſoned within this Dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:17288:24"/>
The other part, to not ſend Proceſſes elſe where, is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon that which is ſaid before in this Chapter, and in the preſident for if the priſoners ought to bee judged within the State, and the judgement ought to be made by the ſame Tribunall, and not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any other place, there remaines no cauſe wherefore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes ſhould be ſent forth. True it is that one ought to diſtinguiſh betweene Proceſſes framed againſt thoſe that are reſtrayned heere, or againſt thoſe that are cited, and thoſe that are contumacious, for theſe are they which are not to bee revealed elſe where: but examinations or other acts made at the requeſt of another Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt any one that is reſtrained there, or hath committed any contempt againſt it, as acts not belonging to this Dominion ought to be ſent to whoſoever requires them But: yet the Aſſiſtants ought not by any meanes to ſuffer any ſuch acts to bee made without their preſence, as it hath beene ſaid in the thirteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and becauſe that the Inquiſition ſhould doe all as it doth, as a mixt Office, and not as meerely Eccleſiaſticall.</p>

               <p>THe eighteene Chapter that reſtraint ſhall not bee granted, but onely in caſes meerely concerning the Inquiſition Office, and in a Proceſſe framed with Aſſiſtance, and that in a doubt full caſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count bee given to the Prince wanteth no proofe; ſince that the ſame Canon Law hath ordained, that the Inquiſition ſhould not aſſume any caſes but of manifeſt Hereſie: yea, the Law being, that any Iudge may have power to declare, whether a doubtfull caſe doe belong or not belong to his juriſdiction, the Doctors ſay that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition cannot doe it, but onely aſſume thoſe which are cleare, and to leave the doubtfull ones for the ordinary Judge, to determine whether they belong to them or no. But as this Chapter hath no neede of proofe or declaration, ſo hath it neede of carefull obſervance. It is a thing frequent, yea and ordinary, that a Judge whoſe juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is limited, ſeeketh as much as he can to enlarge it, diſabling the generall Iuriſdiction, as well Civill as Eccleſiaſticall. And this commeth as well through the naturall inclination which all men have as neere as they can for to command, as alſo for the profit which the Office receiveth: Wherefore if the Inquiſitors doe extend themſelves beyond their naturall duty, they are moſt to blame that doe ſuffer it, though ſometimes with a good intent, yet never with wiſedome. Some beleeve that the more they ſuffer that juriſdiction to enlarge it ſelfe, the greater Service they doe to God, and beleeve it is a favouring of Religion: Others with a good zeale have ſuffered the Inquiſition to aſſume unto it ſelfe, blaſphemies and Inchantments, and ſome others uſury alſo, hoping that through the credit and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Office, they would bee the eaſier rooted out. But the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent hath ſhewne, and will ever ſhew the contrary; yea, the Service of God is diminiſhed, offences take deeper roote, and the Office lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its reputation. And if at any time the leaving of the Inquiſition, a cauſe which did not belong unto it hath proved well for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it hath afterwards cauſed ſo many and ſo grievous evils, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17288:25"/>
the Secular Magiſtrate hath beene forced through meere neceſſity, to re-aſſume the Cogniſance of thoſe offences, which with ſmall diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had left to the Inquiſition, not without many controverſies, and contentions of juriſdictions betweene that Office and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ordinary, accompanied with many confuſions. Wee muſt not thinke that the reſtraining of the Inquiſition Office within the due bounds, the not ſuffering of it to aſſume any Caſes, but thoſe which manifeſtly belong unto it, and to proceed with the preſence of them who ought to be there, and other like modifications, to bee a diminiſhing, or an abuſing of it: but contrariwiſe this is a way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll it, to make it the more to bee reſpected, and to preſerve it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually. In thoſe Countries where heretofore it was, and now at this preſent it is driven out: it hath beene for no other cauſe, but onely becauſe they have aſſumed ſo much to themſelves, that it was intollerable to the people. Every one doth willingly endure a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable bond, but from an exceſſive one, every one will ſeeke by all meanes though indirect, to free themſelves. The ancient Hiſtory of the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot, which, becauſe it could not bee untied, was cut to peices, is to be applyed to all humane ties and bonds, which if they be of ſuch a ſort, that thoſe which are unjuſtly bound, may free themſelves by ordinary way of Iuſtice, then they are ſuffered, but if there be no ordinary meanes, then they runne to extraordinary ones, as ſeditions, and other plagues: Wherefore it is verily to be beleeved that it is doing of God good ſervice, for to reſtraine that Office within the due bounds, which is ſo neceſſary for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Religion, and that to grant it exorbitant Authority, thinking it to bee a favouring of Religion, is an undiſcreet zeale, proue to end in the diſhonour of God; dammage of Religion, and publicke confuſion. And in this moſt happy eſtate, with much ſervice to God, it hath bin preſerved through the orders which the renowned Common-wealth hath made from time to time, to withſtand the abuſes which were creeping in, by enlarging the Authority more than it ought to bee. And as long as the ſame orders ſhall bee kept, and remedies found for other abuſes which ſhould daily grow, it will ever be preſerved with the ſame fruites.</p>

               <p>THe nineteenth Chapter that Inchanters, and Sooth ſayers doe not belong to the Inquiſition, is without any difficulty, for the ſame Canon Lawes doe forbid the Inquiſitors to meddle with them, unleſſe they doe containe manifeſt Hereſie. And it is the more needfull to performe this, becauſe that thoſe who are accuſed for ſuch offences are women, or other weake brained Perſons, who had more neede to be taught or inſtructed by the Confeſſor, than to bee puniſhed by a Iudge, and eſpecially if they bee perſons of quality, whom it is not fitting to carry before Tribunals; with ſcandall and diſturbance of the family. The ſame care is to bee had, that they meddle not with Witch-crafts, as is ſaid in the twentieth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Chapter needeth no Expoſition.</p>

               <p>THe Inquiſition ought not to Iudge of ordinary Blaſphemies, ſince both the Canon and Civill Lawes, and the cuſtome of all the world have decided that they doe not belong to the Inquiſition; neither doth any one doubt of it, ſeeing the plaineneſſe of the Lawes: as for the hurtfull witches, the moſt excellent greater Counſell or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that they ſhould be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate; for Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall puniſhments, are not ſufficient chaſtiſements for ſo great a wickedneſſe. The ſame reaſon did move the moſt excellent Senate to determine the ſame in caſes of hereticall blaſphemy in the yeare 1595. which deliberation was very mature, &amp; after advice taken of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17288:26"/>
the Conſulters of that Age: which two determinations doe not take away nor hinder the Cogniſance of the Inquiſition, for the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſuſpition of Hereſie; but leaving that circumſtance to the judgement of that Tribunall, they onely puniſh that offence which would otherwiſe remaine unpuniſhed; the Eccleſiaſticall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having no puniſhment anſwerable to it. Which thing is no let to the Office of Hereſie, but a chaſtiſement for the injury done to God, and the dammage done to the neighbour. Some Inquiſitors would have not onely the puniſhing of Hereſie, but alſo the miſdeede; and the blaſphemy to be left unto their judging, and they give two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it: The one is, that when in the offence there is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and the acceſſory, the principall draweth the other unto it: but in hereticall blaſphemies, ſuſpition of Hereſie being the principall, and belonging to the Inquiſition, the blaſphemy alſo ought to belong unto it which is but the acceſſory. The other is becauſe it ſeemeth too cruell to them, to have one offence puniſhed with two ſentences; and doe alledge the common ſaying, that there are not two Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments allowed, againſt the ſame fault; but theſe oppoſitions are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered. The firſt, becauſe that ſuppoſe the ſuſpition of Hereſie were the principall (which thing St. <hi>Thomas</hi> doth not allow) yet nevertheleſſe it is not neceſſary, that it ſhould draw the blaſphemy along with it, ſince they are not ſo connexed together that they may not be ſevered, and that one may not have judiciall knowledge of the one, without knowledge of the other. but the Secular may very well admit the Perſons, and examine him that is accuſed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the injurious words uttered againſt the Divine Majeſty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going any further to examine what is his beliefe, and what hee beareth in his minde. Therefore there is no ſuch connexion betweene the blaſphemy, and the enquiring of the Hereſie, but that they may be ſeparated, and each judged in the right and competent Court. The like is to be ſaid when holy and Divine words are had in deriſion, as in transformed Pſalmes, in which the Secular takes notice, onely of the injury done to God, leaving it to the Inquiſition, to ſeeke whether it may thereby be ſuppoſed that the offender hath a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe beliefe. And in the offences done againſt holy Images with wounds and other ſtroakes, it is a great deale plainer, ſeeing that the Magiſtrate puniſheth, nothing but that externall act, whereby Chriſt hath bin injuried in his Image, leaving it to the Inquiſition to ſearch, whether the offender have ſinned becauſe hee beleeveth ſome falſe Doctrine, or onely through wilfull malice. And to this
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17288:27"/>
purpoſe it is good to conſider, that Hereticall blaſphemy is not the ſame as a ſincere or cruell blaſphemy; moſt cruell is that which is moſt grievous and moſt abuſive. Moſt Hereticall that whence grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the greateſt ſuſpicion of Hereſie, though in himſelfe not ſo great. The Inquiſition regardeth the greateſt ſuſpicion, which carrieth with it the greateſt ſignification of there being an errour in the mind, though in it ſelfe it were not ſo abuſive, and for this cauſe ſometimes will make more matter of words ſpoken againſt Saints, than againſt the divine Majeſty. The greateſt puniſhment the Inquiſition inflicts upon a blaſphemer, is Abjuration, which puniſhment, if it bee on a perſon of low degree, may be ſaid to be no puniſhment at all. And therefore becauſe offences of ſuch importance ſhould not paſſe unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſcandall and evill example, the publicke determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Magiſtrate ſhould puniſh the blaſphemy, and leave to the Inquiſition the matters of Hereſie, is both juſt and neceſſary: But that which ſeemeth abſurd to ſome, <hi>vid.</hi> that two Judgments ſhould bee made in one cauſe is not inconvenient, when the puniſhments which are inflicted are not of the ſame kind, and the end of the wrongs is different; the ſame Cauſe may be judged as civill, and afterwards as criminall. The end of a civill Judgment, is to give every owne his owne; the end of the criminall, is to puniſh the Uſurper. So in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Blaſphemy, the end of the Inquiſition is, if the blaſphemer have a falſe beleefe to teach him the true, and abſolve him from the cenſures he hath incurred by holding of the falſe. The end of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is no other but to puniſh the injury done to the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The puniſhments which the Inquiſition impoſeth, are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as Abjurations, Abſolutions, or Adviſements: The puniſhment which the Magiſtrate inflicts are corporall, yea, it may be ſaid more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that they doe not make two judgments in one Cauſe, but in two ſeverall Cauſes, the Magiſtrate judging the offence of Blaſphemy, and puniſhing it with corporall puniſhment, whereas the Inquiſition forgoing the offence, judgeth of the quality of the ſuſpicion, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth it with ſpirituall puniſhment.</p>

               <head>The Expoſition of the two and twentieth Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe two and twentieth Chapter mentioneth, that ſome Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors to extend their juriſdiction, pretended that the offence of having two Wives did belong to their Office, who doe alledge for reaſon, that it is an abuſe of Matrimony, which is a Sacrament; and that in <hi>Spaine</hi> the caſe is reſerved to the Office of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Contrary is the common Opinion of Civilians, who ſeeing the the Lawes have impoſed no puniſhment on this offence, and the Canon Lawes doe not ſpeake of it, they conclude by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that it belongeth to the Secular juriſdiction: and this is obſerved in all Tribunals, alſo in the ſtate of <hi>Milan,</hi> where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition hath more extended her Authority, than in any other place of <hi>Italy;</hi> the reaſon brought to the contrary, that it is an abuſe of the Sacrament of Matrimony, concluded nothing: for the firſt Wife taken in true matrimony hath the Sacrament annexed to it, and in this there happeneth no abuſe at all. Then in taking of the ſecond, there is no Sacrament, nor Matrimony, nor any manner of Spirituall contract, but a meere nullity done <hi>de facto, non de jure;</hi> ſo that there cannot be ſaid to be any abuſe of the Sacrament neither in the firſt, nor in the ſecond act. Well may it be ſaid, that by the ſecond wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked act of taking another Wife, there is an injury done to the firſt which was a Sacrament, and this is moſt true, but the injury done to the Sacrament of Matrimony doth not belong to the Inquiſition: for adultery is an injury done to the Sacrament, and yet it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Inquiſition to judge of it. And if any one would make having of two Wives, a token of Hereſie, inferring that hee that doth it beleeves it to bee lawfull; with this reaſon hee might draw all caſes to the Inquiſition, for it may as well be ſaid that the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, or the thiefe doe commit thoſe wickedneſſes, beleeving that they are lawfull things; and amongſt the reſt wee ſhould put into the Inquiſition, all <hi>Gipſies,</hi> who get their life by ſtealing, and much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17288:28"/>
more your high-way robbers. But contrariwiſe wee muſt alwayes ſuppoſe, that every ſinner hath a true beliefe, and Catholicke Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but doth ſin either through frailty, or through malice, or through humane compaſſion, and ſo ought to bee puniſhed by his ordinary Iudge: which ought alſo to bee obſerved in him that hath two Wives, if there appeare no other token of a perverſe beliefe. And it is not true that in <hi>Spaine</hi> the caſe is abſolutely reſerved to the Inquiſition, yea it is ordinarily puniſhed by the Secular, by bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the fore-head with a hot Iron. But becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi> hold plurality of Wives to bee lawfull, thoſe who are of <hi>Iewiſh</hi> or <hi>Mooriſh</hi> race are examined at the Inquiſition, for the ſuſpition of Hereſie, and puniſhed with branding for the offence. If a <hi>Turke,</hi> or <hi>Iew</hi> become a Chriſtian, be found to have two Wives, hee may bee tried in the Inquiſition for his ſuſpected beliefe; and for the offence in the ordinary Court of Iuſtice. But when either for carnality, or to ſteale the portion, or for any ſuch ends any one hath taken a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wife, they ought without any circumſtance to proceed, doing Iuſtice in the ordinary Secular Court, puniſhing the offence as the quality of the particular circumſtances ſhall require, preferring the common opinion of Lawyers, and the Univerſall cuſtome of Courts, to cavils onely invented to confound juriſdictions.</p>

               <p>IN caſes of uſury as it is ſaid in this Chapter, it is queſtionleſſe that the Inquiſition ought not to meddle in them: So have many Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> anſwered Inquiſitors, who have purpoſed to draw caſes, and queſtions of Uſury unto their Office, and the Decree is alſo Regiſtred in the Canon Law, where to exclude abſolutely all caſes of uſury out of the Inquiſition, and to provide that by no indirect way, nor under any good colour it might be attempted to judge of any, the Pope ſaith: That though the Inquiſition had enjoyned ſome converted Hereticke ſuch pennance, as if hee had beene an Uſurer

               <p>IN this Chapter is ſet downe, that <hi>Iewes</hi> nor other Infidels ſhall for no cauſe be ſubject to the Inquiſition Office, but onely to the Secular Court. It was ſaid by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainely, that the Eccleſiaſticall Power doth not extend to judge thoſe that are not of the Church. And ſo much hath bin held and obſerved alſo in theſe latter times. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, declared that they were not ſubject to the Pope, neither to the Law, nor yet to bee judged; ſince that by vertue of the Law the Iudge doth exerciſe his Office. Beſides, the Infidels of what kind ſoever they be, are not capable of Spirituall puniſhments, and therefore are not ſubject to the Church which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth with ſuch. In the Body of the Civill Law there be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and puniſhments againſt <hi>Iewes</hi> which blaſpheme, or injury Religion, or draw Chriſtians to Iudaiſme; or to offend <hi>Iewes</hi> which are become Chriſtians: And the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelves, have not uſed any other remedy againſt <hi>Iewes</hi> and other <hi>Infidels,</hi> who have offended in wronging or ſlandering Religion, but onely to excite Princes, and Secular Magiſtrates to doe their duty in puniſhing them: To this purpoſe there be many Decrees in the Canon Law: Some Princes to diſcharge themſelves of the trouble of judging ſuch cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, have delegated them to the Biſhops, which hath not pleaſed the Popes very well.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> having delegated power to ſome Biſhops of his Kingdome to puniſh the <hi>Sarazens</hi> of his Kingdome, in certain:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17288:29"/>
caſes where they offend Religion. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third did write to them that they ſhould onely puniſh ſuch offences, for which was ſufficient a pecuniary Mulct, or whipping, without blood-ſhed: But if the offence did deſerve any greater puniſhment, they ſhould not meddle with it, but ſhould leave the judging of it to the temporall Power. This authority eſtabliſhed by the ſaying of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Canon and Civill Lawes, and by Cuſtomes, none ſhould attempt to contrary it. But the deſire of enlarging authority, doth ſo blinde ſome men, that without regarding ſo much plaineneſſe, they turne themſelves to cavils of no moment, ſaying, That if God doth puniſh, and hath puniſhed Infidels, the Pope, and the Inquiſitors his Delegates, may and ought alſo puniſh them. A reaſon which would prove that they might puniſh both Chriſtians and Infidels, and all manner of offenders, for all manner of offences, though never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and alſo ſinnes onely conceived in the minde: for God doth puniſh all theſe. The truth is, that Chriſt hath not given his Vicars any power but onely over his Church, and in ſpirituall things, and therefore they can judge none but Chriſtians, nor puniſh them but onely with ſpirituall puniſhments. The temporall puniſhments God hath committed to the Secular power, for puniſhing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of offences, and againſt all offendors be they of what Religion they will: And certainly to make an argument from the Divine Omnipotencie to humane authority, it agreeth not with the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to the Divine Majeſty: But another thing muſt bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, for they ſay, that although Infidels be not ſubject to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall power; yet when they doe offend the Church, reaſon will, that ſhe may defend her ſelfe by puniſhing them, it being a terme of Law, That he who is not ſubject to a Territory, by reaſon of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed in it, becomes ſubject to it, which things well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood are all moſt true, yet doe they not conclude in this purpoſe: For the Church muſt not be denyed the defence of her ſelfe, if ſhe be offended, but ſhe ought to doe it with all offenders by meanes of the Magiſtrate. The Infidell who violates holy things, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends Religion muſt not remaine unpuniſhed, and the Church may defend it ſelfe, but not with its owne forces, but with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Magiſtrate: to inflict puniſhment doth not belong to him that is offended, but alwayes to the Iudge, and when by an offence the Delinquent ſhould have his Court of Iudgement allotted him, hee becommeth not ſubject to him that is offended; otherwiſe every private man might chaſtiſe him that doth offend him, but he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17288:29"/>
ſubject to the Iudge of the place where the offence is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherefore theſe reaſons prove nothing but that the offence done by the Infidels to the Church, ought to bee puniſhed by the ordinary Secular Court of judgement: and ſo much the rather ought this to be obſerved, becauſe both Divine and Humane Lawes doe order it ſo, when ſuch ſorts of offences deſerve greater puniſhments, as indeed ſuch offences, for the moſt part are ſo grievous that they will deſerve greater puniſhment than the Inquiſition would inflict upon them.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1581. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, framed a Bull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jewes, in which he did ſubject both them and all other Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to the Inquiſition in tenne caſes ſo fully ſet downe, that if it ſhould be obſerved no Infidell might inhabite nor trade within Chriſtian Dominion. This Bull although it were imprinted, yet was it publiſhed or received but in very few places, and it were impoſſible to obſerve it. Yea, Pope <hi>Sixto</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Clement</hi> the eight not regarding it, did give Infidels ſafe conducts to come to the City of <hi>Ancona.</hi> And that which is moſt important is, that in the Commiſſion granted by the Cardinals to the Inquiſitors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is expreſſed how farre their authority extendeth; there is not the leaſt mention made of Iewes or other Infidels; a manifeſt proofe that they can pretend no power over them. But of that Bull of <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, and other, it will be a more fitting place to ſpeake at large in the 28. Chapter: To conclude therefore the Inquiſition Office is ordained againſt Hereſie: wherefore it is not fitting it ſhould be enlarged to other offences; Infidelity is no Hereſie, and the offences which Infidels commit to the wrong and diſhonour of Religion, have no need of Eccleſiaſticall Cogniſance, but may very well be taken notice of, and puniſhed by the Secular power, and it ought to be obſerved, it being commanded by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Canon, and Civill Law.</p>

               <p>THe Office of the Inquiſition out of this State pretends, that it may judge your Eaſterne Chriſtians upon any Articles, even in thoſe wherein the Nation wholly diſſents from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> In this moſt renowned Dominion, regarding the protection which the Prince hath of the Greeke Nation, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors doe not extend their pretences ſo farre, but ſay: That the <hi>Grecians</hi> may be ſuffered in thoſe three opinions, wherein they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Eaſterne: but if any of them doe hold any ſiniſter opinion, in any of thoſe heads wherein their Nation agreeth with ours, that they ought to be ſubject to the Inquiſition. Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is ſuperfluous, and not leſſe oppoſite to the Princes prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then if they were judged in the three different caſes, alſo it is ſuperfluous, becauſe that there being no Hereſies at all at this preſent amongſt the <hi>Greekes,</hi> concerning any of the common Articles, this caſe cannot happen againſt the protection, becauſe that they are bound by their cuſtomes to acknowledge no ſuperiour in any thing, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their owne Prieſts: which thing whether it may juſtly bee maintained, or no, may very well be decided by the cuſtomes which have ever beene obſerved.</p>
               <p>The Eaſterne and Weſterne Churches continued both in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Chriſtian Charity, for the ſpace of nine hundred yeares or more, in which times the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was reverenced, and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no leſſe by the <hi>Greekes</hi> than by the <hi>Latines.</hi> He was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor, and chiefe of all the Eaſterne Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Biſhops. In the perſecutions of Hereticks they implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his aide, and of other Biſhops of <hi>Italy,</hi> and this peace was eaſily kept, becauſe the ſupreame power was in the Canons, to which both parts acknowledged themſelves ſubject, Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17288:30"/>
ſeverely maintained in each Countrey by the Prelates of it, not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily, but abſolutely, according Order, and Canonicall rigour, none putting his hand into another mans Government, but adviſed one another by the obſervance of the Canons. In thoſe dayes never any Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> did pretend to conferre any Benefices in other Biſhops Dioceſſes; neither was the Cuſtome yet brought in of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting money out of others by way of Diſpenſations or Bulls. But as ſoone as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> beganne to pretend that it was not ſubject to Canons, but it was according to her owne diſcretion, ſhe might after any ancient Order of the Fathers, Councells, yea, and of the Apoſtles themſelves, and that it attempted, in ſtead of the ancient Primary of the Apoſtolicall Sea, to bring in an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dominion, not ruled by any Law or Canon, then the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion grew.</p>
               <p>And though within theſe ſeven hundred yeares a peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union hath beene often attempted, yet could it never be brought to paſſe, becauſe they have alwayes hearkned to debates and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and not to the taking away of that abuſe which was the reall cauſe of bringing in the Deviſion, and hath beene the true cauſe as yet of maintaining it. Whilſt the Churches were united, St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine was alſo joyntly held and obſerved, that in caſes of publicke Government, every one ſhould be ſubject to the Prince, becauſe God commands it ſo, who is diſobeyed by him who doth not obey Secular Power, by him appointed for the governing of mankind. Never did any pretend that he might not be puniſhed for his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, holding it for certaine, that to have an exempted power to doe evill, is a thing condemned by God and men: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his words were in every ones mouth, <hi>vid. Wilt thou bee exempt from feare of Temporall puniſhments, doe well, and thou ſhalt not onely not bee puniſhed, but ſhalt alſo be applauded by it. But if thou doſt evill, thou oughteſt to feare it, becauſe the Sword of Iustice for the Divine ſervice to puniſh evill deedes hath not beene given to it in vaine.</hi> After the Diviſion of the Churches in the Eaſtern<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Church, the ſame opinion remained, and ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>vid.</hi> that every Chriſtian for Spirituall buſineſſes is onely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Eccleſiaſticall power, but in Temporall to the Prince. And nothing is more Temporall than offence, becauſe nothing is more contrary to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>There continueth alſo amongſt the <hi>Greekes,</hi> that Doctrine, that Biſhops ought to judge; which opinion is Catholicall, and which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17288:31"/>
hereticall, but to puniſh thoſe who hold hurtfull opinions, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Secular. Now the truth being thus in the things aforeſaid, which are manifeſt and cleare; the Inquiſition ought not to meddle with the <hi>Greekes</hi> for foure reaſons: Firſt, becauſe that whilſt a cauſe remaines undecided, it is not reaſonable that the one party ſhould bee judged by the other in their owne controverſie: But this is the controverſie betweene the <hi>Greekes</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they require the obſervation of the Canons, which ſubject each Nation to their proper Prelates; and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to bee above the Canons: Therefore the <hi>Greekes</hi> ought not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Officers in this controverſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſecond is, becauſe that it is certaine that before the diviſion, the <hi>Grecians</hi> were in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall judgements ſubject to the Secular Magiſtrate, and in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to their ſuperiors; Therefore it is juſt to have their right and cuſtome maintained to them. The third, is becauſe if the Prince ſhould grant the Inquiſition power to judge the <hi>Greekes,</hi> hee ſhould deprive himſelfe of his proper Authority, which he may withquietnes exerciſe, &amp; not without troble give way to have it exerciſed by others. The power of puniſhing offences in the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> Church, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beene in the Prince; and the <hi>Greekes</hi> in theſe dayes doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, and deſire it may ſo continue: So that with quietneſſe juſtice may be adminiſtred by the Magiſtrate, whereas the leaving of it to the Inquiſition, with contradiction of the whole Nation, might bring in a thouſand inconveniences. The fourth, becauſe the moſt renowned Common-wealth gives the <hi>Greekes</hi> leave, to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their cuſtomes; but their cuſtome is, that in Secular things, and in the puniſhing of any manner of offence they ſhall be ſubject to the Prince, and in ſpirituall things they ſhall obey their Prieſts: therefore maintaining the protection which is promiſed them, they connot bee ſubject to others. Therefore it is not bee ſuffered, that the Inquiſition ſhould ſearch out what the <hi>Greekes</hi> doe, or beleeve in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: And if they chance to heare that any, lives or ſpeakes ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly of the <hi>Latins,</hi> then have they a ready and eaſie way to helpe it, by giving the Magiſtrate notice of it, by whom juſtice ſhall bee adminiſtred, and eſpecially in a matter of ſuch importance, as to provide againſt ſcandals and tumults.</p>

Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, in the yeare 1595. made a Bull concerning <hi>Italians</hi> onely, commanding that none, no not for matters of Merchandiſe ſhould goe into a place where there were not a Pariſh Prieſt, and a publicke Church which exerciſed the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Rites, unleſſe hee had leave from the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; adding that thoſe who had leave, ſhould bee bound to ſend every yeare a certificate over, that they were confeſſed, and had communicated. To bring in the obſervance of this Bull, as ſoone as any <hi>Italian</hi> comes beyond the mountaines, preſently the Ieſuits come upon him for comming over without Licence; and if he doth not yeeld unto them, and promiſe them obedience, they preſently examine ſome adherent of his againſt him, and frame a ſecret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe againſt him, which they ſend to <hi>Rome,</hi> from which there is a proceſſe writ to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Inquiſitor of the place where hee was bred up, to call him by publicke Citation. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in former times, was wont to be made from the Inquiſition of <hi>Rome,</hi> but now they are beware of doing ſo, becauſe the Cities beyond the Hills doe revenge themſelves, by proceeding againſt ſome adherents of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to avoyd this danger, they cite no more to <hi>Rome,</hi> but have him cited to the place of his bringing up. This invention though it bee coloured with Religion, aimeth at the making of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> Miſtris in <hi>Italy,</hi> of Merchandiſes which come from beyond the Mountaines; as three hundred yeares agoe it brought under it, with a leſſe pretence, the Merchandiſes of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> It will not bee from the purpoſe to relate here what was
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17288:32"/>
then done, and what was the event of it; eſpecially within this City, that we may the better ſinke into that which is now done. It was ordered and commanded by the Governors, that <hi>Infidels</hi> ſhould be forbidden to carry Armes, or any other inſtrument where with they might make Warre with Chriſtians; the Derree as honeſt was received by all men: This ready obedience of the World, gave Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, hope of ſtepping yet one ſtep further: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the yeare of our Lord 1307. hee publiſhed a Bull, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that none might carry any Merchandiſe of any kind into the the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> Countries, nor that there ſhould any bee ſuffered to goe out of the Harbors for ſuch a voyage, upon paine of excommunication, and other grievous penalties, as well ſpirituall as temporall: and amongſt other that none hath carried, or ſuffered any to bee carried of what kind ſoever, might bee abſolved unleſſe hee firſt preciſely paid ſo much as the principall which was tranſported amounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The difficulty, if not impoſſibility of obſerving ſo ſtrict an order, was a cauſe that there were many offendors in <hi>Venice,</hi> who during their life did little thinke of it: but at the poynt of death to receive their abſolution, they left (according to the Popes command) order to have the offence ſatisfied: Neither wanted there Confeſſors to urge it inſtantly, denying alſo abſolution to ſuch as did not pay, or give order to be paid, ſo much as the principall of that whcih hee had carried into the <hi>Eaſt</hi> came unto. Many who have beene that voyage ſeverall times, found themſelves to owe more than they were worth at their houre of death: Wherefore for the diſcharge of their Conſciences, they would by Will leave all they had to the Popes diſpoſing. The Heires, and the Commiſſaries did deferre the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the Wills, ſeeing they tended to the deſtruction of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and of the Common-wealth, eſpecially there being ſome who held ſuch Wills to be voyd and extinguiſhed. By this meanes in fifteene yeares the mony due to the Pope, came to a ſumme ſufficient to have emptied the City of money: to which Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth, who was his ſucceſſor applying his mind, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the money on all ſides, in the yeare 1322. ſent <hi>Ardenato Largo,</hi> and <hi>Falcone Caſtario Nuncioes</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> to receive that which by Will was left to the Popes diſpoſall, conſtraining notaries and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to produce the Wills, excommunicating them which did not deliver them. Beſides hee gave theſe <hi>Nuntioes</hi> Commiſſion alſo to ſee to, and to excommunicate all thoſe which were alive, that had ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thither, &amp; to abſolve them, paying the principall of the Merchandiſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17288:32"/>
which was carried thether. Theſe <hi>Nuntioes</hi> being come to <hi>Venice</hi> &amp; having erected a judgement Seate, committed divers diſorders, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the which one was, that they Excommunicated St. <hi>Marke</hi> his Proctors, and above two hundred other Perſons, men and women for the aforeſaid cauſe. Thoſe who were then conſultors of the Common-wealth, amongſt which was one <hi>Andrea,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chiozza,</hi> did adviſe that theſe <hi>Nuntioes</hi> actions were not Lawfull, &amp; reſolved to withſtand them with apeales, &amp; other remedies which were put in practice, to that theſe <hi>Nuntioes</hi> attempts did take no effect. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it hapneth in ſuch caſes many inconveniences remained, which continuing with great danger for the ſpace of two yeares, the Pope was forced to apply a remedy, which was worſe than the ſoare. He made a Bull in the yeare 1324. confeſſing that his <hi>Nuntioes</hi> actions had bin diſorderly, ſuſpended the cenſures by them pronouced, and gave the Arch Biſhop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> Commiſſion to execute it; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him afterwards, that he ſhould ſet downe a convenient time for men and women who had beene cenſured by the <hi>Nuntioes,</hi> to appeare for that cauſe at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was then at <hi>Avignon,</hi> either in Perſon, or by their Proctors to treate of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, excepting none but onely the Duke and the Commonalty. It was a brave increaſe for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to have ſome 200. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or more to come thither at once, for money matters of ſo great weight. But what happened, and whither the Pope were obeyed by few or many, I cannot juſtifie: But it is certaine that then there did ariſe an opinion which ſaid, that it was no ſin to carry Merchandiſes to <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſo they were not things for the uſe of Warre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Pope could not hinder it: which moved him in the yeare 1326. to make a Bull, declaring them to be Hereticks which ſaid that it was no ſinne to carry Merchandiſe to the <hi>Infidels,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not uſefull for Warre. But then the controverſies which the Pope had with the Emperour, brake out into an open Warre, ſo that he being (as <hi>Ludovico Bavaro</hi> writes) all the reſt of his life employed in greater affaires, had no time to thinke on this. Under his ſucceſſour there was ſome moderation found, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſet his hand, not to the revoking of the Decree as it had beene juſt, but to grant Licences. And this renowned Common-wealth asked for them, and obtained them; ſometimes for a yeare, and ſometimes for a longer time, but prefixed; and ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the number of ſhips, ſometimes leaving it free: And theſe Licences coſt money, but how much it was not alwayes knowne.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17288:33"/>
Yet will I ſpeake in this particular, that for one Licence granted by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the ſixt, in the yeare 1361. they agreed to pay nine thouſand Ducats of gold of the Chamber, alleadging that it could not be done for leſſe; becauſe that the Apoſtolicall Chamber was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and in want. This grievance laſted untill a little after the yeare 1400. for then the truth being made manifeſt to the World, that it was free and Lawfull for the Merchant to doe it, the Court with-drew it ſelfe from her pretences.</p>
               <p>Now to attempt that none ſhould goe without a Licence, into any Lands, which doe not acknowledge the Pope, hath a more ſeeming colour than at that time; ſaying, that it is done for feare leaſt they ſhould be embrewed with ſome falſe Doctrine: as though a written and ſealed paper could be a preſervative unto them, and as though he might not chance to eſcape untouched which went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Licence, and that it were impoſſible for him that had it to bee infected: Whence it is evidently ſeene, that forbidding them to goe into thoſe Countries without leave, is not zeale to Religion, but a deſire of commanding, and to bring the Secular Power under, and to reape ſome good benefit. If the juſt liberty of Merchandizing ought not to beare this burthen, it neither ought to bee ſuffered, that one who hath here lived as a good Catholicke, and is gone beyond the Mountaines, becauſe he hath not asked the Inquiſitor leave, ſhould be moleſted and hindered in his buſineſſes, for any imputation laid upon him from <hi>Rome,</hi> to the diſgrace of his friends, who are blemiſhed thereby: eſpecially ſince they refuſe to have this citation made at <hi>Rome,</hi> fearing the revenge of thoſe Cities beyond the Mountaines, which ſhall hold themſelves offended thereby: it is not reaſonable that they ſhould thus conceale themſelves, &amp; lay on other mens backs, that which is done for their owne proper ends, and ſo by theſe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect wayes, make themſelves maſters of the Merchandize which commeth from beyond the Hills. And therefore, if any Native of this Dominion, have lived as a good Catholicke in this Country, and for his owne occaſions have paſſed the mountaines, it were unjuſt to trouble him any way before his returne, upon any relation that ſhall bee made of him.</p>

               <head>The Expoſition of the ſeven and twentieth Chapter,</head>
               <p>COncerning the 27. Chapter, that confiſcation of Goods ſhall not be admitted in this matter of Hereſie, it being already brought in, and the cuſtome eſtabliſhed without any contradiction, there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing but onely to continue the obſerving of it; ſince it is much for God, and Religious ſervice, whereof when one treateth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it is alwayes hurtfull to intermixe any money matter with it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that thereby the World is ſcandalized, and ſeeing money hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens into the buſineſſe, it cannot be perſwaded (though it were plaine and true) that the Service of God holdeth the firſt place therein. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> will never ceaſe upon all occaſions to blame this order, beleeving that this moderation eſtabliſhed by the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Common-wealth, doth to upbraide the <hi>Roman</hi> Ordinance with too much ſeverity. That which it will publickely alledge is, that Hereſie is an offenee of treaſon againſt the Divine Majeſty, which ought more to bee puniſhed than that againſt man; wherefore it is a perverting of order, when greater puniſhment is inflicted on him who offendeth man, than on him who offendeth God: and therefore if they confiſcate goods for humane treaſon, much more ought they to confiſcate them for Divine treaſon, which offence they they runne into by Hereſie. But this appearance is but a ſhadow without a body, for it would condemne their owne conſtitutions, which doe pardon the Delict of Hereſie for the firſt time, but the Delict of humane Majeſty offended, is not pardoned for the firſt time: ſo that it would ſeeme that leſſe account were made of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God than men. Wherefore the truth is, that in impoſing of puniſhments, reſpect is not had onely to the grievouſneſſe of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but alſo to the circumſtances of the dammage which it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to others; or to the diſhoneſty adjoyned to it, or to the more perverſe will of the offender. Humane Majeſty is not offended, but with a certaine malice, and deſire of him that offendeth, and Hereſie
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17288:34"/>
very often is through ignorance; whence this for the moſt part deſerves compaſſion, but that never. The confiſcation of Goods terrifieth others, who at leaſt abſtaine for love of their children, preferring their good before the paſſions which move them againſt their Prince. But in caſe of Hereſie every one ſeemeth to be moved by a ſpirituall reſpect, which ought not to bee leſſe eſteemed than the death of children. The event ſheweth that this moſt happy ſtate, with more generall ſatisfaction, reſts as free from hereticall diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without taking away of goods, as others where with ſeverity they are taken away. Therefore not regarding other mens orders or examples, or what others ſay, we ought to follow thoſe orders which experience teacheth us to bee good.</p>

            <div n="28" type="chapter">
               <head>The Expoſition of the twenty eight Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe twenty eight Chapter, that no Bull or Ordinance of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither new nor old, be publiſhed without the Prince his expreſſe Licence, is of moſt important and neceſſary conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the preſerving of the Inquiſition; Upon which Chapter I will firſt ſet forth the juridicall and true reaſon, why it ought to be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, with the inconvenience which would follow, if it were done otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>It is cleare, that as every one may, for his owne ends, at his owne will and pleaſure, change Orders, and governe a juriſdiction which is wholly his owne, without acquainting one therewith, or asking any ones conſent; ſo where by contract and agreement betweene two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is a Tribunall ſet up, and a forme given, one of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not upon any reaſon, though never ſo excellent and undoubted, make any alteration without the conſent of the other contracter: ſuch is the nature of a contract and agreement, that as it receiveth his being and exiſtence by the conſent of the Contracters, ſo it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17288:34"/>
cannot receive the leaſt alteration without the ſame conſent: So that if any alteration bee needfull through change of times, or other circumſtances, it cannot be lawfully made but by both parties. It is plaine that the office of the Inquiſition within this dominion was appoynted by order of the greater Councell, and by conſent of the Pope in the yeare 1289. with Covenants then eſtabliſhed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no new thing which hath happened ſince can alter it, if the ſame who agreed in the inſtitution, doe not likewiſe agree in the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore if the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> decrees any new thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that matter, it cannot extend its force upon that Office, but onely with the Prince his conſent. This is the true reaſon why Bulls and Orders made ſince that time at <hi>Rome</hi> cannot binde. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be aleadged to the contrary, that diverſe times doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire divers Orders, and that Popes for the better government have made other reaſonable Lawes, which ought to be received: for the anſwer to this plaine, that as in the world nothing can bee held unchangeable, and every cuſtome ought to be accommodated to the times and perſons, ſo it is to be done to them whom in reaſon it concernes to doe it, and by no others. If any one would rule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon buſineſſe of himſelfe, though he did doe it with a good intent and happy iſſue, yet did he nevertheleſſe tranſgreſſe Divine and Humane Lawes: the ſame reaſon which cauſed the Inquiſition to be firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by agreement, doth now alſo ſuffer no new Laws or orders to be made, but by agreement. To give force unto a Law it is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that it be convenient and reaſonable, but it is alſo eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that it be made by thoſe who have full power: Neither is that ſaid onely for the preſervation of power and juriſdiction, but alſo for the neceſſity of a good government. The Inquiſition was not then inſtituted with the ſame Conditions, as in the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe the conſiderations of this Common-wealth and other States were different. So now likewiſe divers conſiderations cauſe that which is expedient at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſometimes not to bee expedient here: Wherefore it may not be convenient preſently to execute in this ſtate, that which the Pope for his owne reſpects hath ordered, but firſt ought to be conſidered whether it agree with the reſpects of this place, which thing none but the Prince can doe, as one who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone knoweth what is needfull for the publicke affaires: And therefore although the new or old Bull ſhould ſeeme unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour honeſt and profitable, yet ought not he therein to follow his owne judgement, it being proper to the Prince alone to know
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17288:35"/>
what is expedient: Neither ought it to ſeeme grievous to the Biſhops or Inquiſitors, to have that which is juſt and lawfull executed in due manner, judgement, and forme. The Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine</hi> which is likewiſe ordained by agreement, proceedes in the ſelfe ſame manner. It hath its owne Lawes and proper Cuſtomes by which it is governed, neither is it altered, or receiveth new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from <hi>Rome;</hi> but if for any publicke reſpects the Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, that it were good to bring up ſome new thing in <hi>Spaine,</hi> they write to the Generall Royall Counſell over the Inquiſition where it is conſulted of, and according as the reſpects of <hi>Spaine</hi> will beare, it is received either in part, or in all, or in part, or in all laid aſide.</p>
               <p>But that the obſervance of this Chapter is neceſſary not onely for the maintaining of the proper Power, and juriſdiction, but alſo to withſtand infinite inconveniences, hee may finde it plainly that ſhall conſider theſe things following.</p>
               <p>Firſt ſpeaking of Bulls already made, many are contrary to the Inſtitutions of this moſt renowned Common-wealth; as thoſe that command Hereticks to be burned openly and alive. The confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goods, with cenſures to thoſe Princes who doe not admit of them. The demoliſhing of a houſe where a Heretick is found, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be none of his owne: That the Inquiſition may cauſe any that it ſuſpecteth to give it a pecuniary ſecurity to live a good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke: That the Inquiſition have an armed Court properly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to that office, All theſe are Pontificiall Ordinances, contrary to the Cuſtomes of this State; ſome doe give Inquiſitors exceſſive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as thoſe which will have them, have power to give leave to weare Armes, and to make <hi>Croceſegnati,</hi> which things could not bee put in practice, without great confuſion: ſome are ſo ſevere, that they cannot agree with the government of this State, as that of <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, which will not have him pardoned his life, that will come home againe, having held any one of thoſe five Articles, which by him are named: And another of <hi>Pio</hi> the fifth, that no ſentence given in the behalfe of one that was accuſed and found innocent, ſhould <hi>tranſire in rem Iudicatam,</hi> although it were given after the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall purgation, but that the Office may alwayes take the ſame cauſe in hand againe, upon the ſame proofes, which order if it were in uſe would bee a continuall torment to thoſe wretches.</p>
               <p>And that other of the ſame Pope, that whoſoever ſhould offend, or but onely threaten a Notary, or other Officer of the Inquiſition, or a
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17288:35"/>
Witneſſe examined in that Office, beſides the Excommunication, ſhould be guilty of High Treaſon, and ſhould be puniſhed with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall puniſhment, his goods confiſcated, his children infamous, and uncapable to ſucceede others by will: To which puniſhment ſhould alſo be ſubject whoſoever ſhould not onely caſe one to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape out of Priſon, but he alſo that ſhould but attempt it, although the effect did not follow: and alſo whoſoever ſhould favour any ſuch, or mediate for them, with other clauſes of moſt cruell temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, comprehending alſo titular Perſons and Princes. Yet this is that Bull which was made in the yeare 1569. but was never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nor publiſhed in this State. The Cardinall <hi>Arrigoni,</hi> eight and forty yeares after that, <hi>vid.</hi> in the yeare 1617. commanded the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this City of <hi>Venice,</hi> that it ſhould print it and publiſh it, and it had beene done, if the moſt renowned Reformators of thoſe times, by order of the moſt excellent Counſell had not hindered it. Any one may conſider how many Proceſſes might be made for every word that ſhould be ſpoken to one of the notaries, witneſſes, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncers, who had thought themſelves wronged, and how many wretches would have bin daily vexed. It were long to rehearſe all thoſe things which are contrary to the cuſtomes of theſe Countries, but the above ſaid are ſufficient to ſhew that without the diſturbance of the publicke authority and peace, they cannot be all generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But if any be neceſſary or profitable for the puniſhment of Hereticks, it is fitting that it ſhould be received: but to know which is ſuch a one, belongeth properly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the prince, nor can any one elſe know it. Neither ought any one to be confident that they may bee received without confuſion, becauſe they are of force in <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet things there are quietly carryed, the State of <hi>Rome</hi> being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of other Princes. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſay they are above theſe Ordinances, if they thinke fit they may obſerve them, if not, they may omit them, or diſpence with them, and they doe wonderfully ſerve for their ends, as well when they are obſerved, as when they are diſobeyed, becauſe they are not to bee ruled by the Lawes, but they doe rule the Lawes. Contrariwiſe in other States when they are once publiſhed or received, they are no more in the Prince his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: They muſt then runne to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeeke a remedy, when they are heard, and either they doe get remedy or not; they regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not what is behoovefull to another State, but to their owne. And this is that which the court of <hi>Rome</hi> would have, and every day attempted, <hi>vid.</hi> to have in their hand, under colour of Religion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17288:36"/>
the adminiſtration of ſome certaine things, without which States cannot be governed, by which meanes it would become judge of all governments. For this cauſe, the Popes ſay daily when they would cauſe their Decrees to be admitted, that if there be any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, they ſhould have recourſe to them, and they will helpe it, but the remedy which commeth not from the ſame Prince, but from them who have their proper intereſts, is worſer than the ſore. God whoſe workes are perfect, and who is the Author of all Principalities, gives to every one as much power as is neceſſary to governe well; neither will he have it acknowledged from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but from his Divine Majeſty. All that which a Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth from others, but from God, is ſlavery and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>So much is ſaid generally of the conſideration which ought to bee had in publiſhing or receiving Pontificiall Orders made of old in matters of Hereſie. But much greater care ought to bee had concerning thoſe which ſhall be made hereafter. Of them which are made already the number is certaine, it is knowne whether they be received in other places or no, how they are obſerved: what conſtruction they receive, what is their aime, what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of good or evill effects they bring with them: But for the time to come, if the Court might have her liberty the number would grow to be infinite. When one newly appeares, it is not knowne whether the World will admit of it or no; the aime of him that made it, is not yet diſcovered, experience hath not ſhewne what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it may bring forth; and therefore all delay and maturity in receiving of it, will bring forth aboundance of conveniency with it. It is not ſaid, that new reaſonable orders are not to bee accepted, but that they ought not to be received as of duty, or as ſubjects, but by agreement and publicke treaty, the inſtitution of that Office requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it as it is ſaid, and with much conſideration, becauſe of the great dangers that novelties doe bring with them. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in making new Buls, taketh no great advice; with eaſe they are made, becauſe with eaſe they are revoked; or derogated from, or diſpenſed with; as it fals to be moſt commodious for their buſineſſes, wherein they regard their owne ends: But that which is profitable for one State, is not profitable for another. The ſafety of this Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion requireth that Religion ſhould bee kept inviolate in all her parts, withſtanding all change and novelty whatſoever. The reſpects of <hi>Rome</hi> require, that no change ſhall be made, through which Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17288:36"/>
power may be diminiſhed, nor the Court loſe any of her profits which ſhe draweth out of other Statues: But thoſe novelties whereby the profit of the Court may be increaſed, or temporall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority may bee diminiſhed, with the exaltation of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, are not to bee abhorred, but procured; and that wee ſee daily.</p>
               <p>This moſt renowned Common-wealth, as well as other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Kingdomes, finds it ſelfe betweene two contraries. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants who have no other aime but to diminiſh Eccleſiaſticall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath no other aime but to increaſe it, and to make the temporall her ſervant: Whence your Catholicke States and Kingdomes to preſerve themſelves, doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all novelties on the on &amp; the other ſide, and doe keepe Religion without any change at all, being knowne by experience, that either of the novelties are pernicious. That reverence which deſervedly is given to Religion, is the cauſe that thoſe abuſes have eaſie admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which come covered with that ſacred Mantle. For the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Religion, the office againſt Hereſie is reſpected, and for this cauſe, when <hi>Rome</hi> will bring in ſome novelty, it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly makes uſe of that office, ſuppoſing that the true end will not appeare. And that hath beene wrought in the ſelfe ſame manner in times paſt, but very ſlightly in regard of what was done at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Nevertheleſſe the Senators of thoſe times were alwayes care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. They would have the Office againſt Hereſie to bee mixt; they have oppoſed themſelves againſt all novelties: they have not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Eccleſiaſticall Perſons to doe any thing unknowne, unſeene or unexamined. By theſe foot-ſteps muſt he walke that will have the Common-wealth preſerved, not ſuffering new Buls, or Decrees to bee accepted within the State, if firſt by mature deliberation it be not made knowne, that they will bring in no inconveniences. Which deliberation is proper to the Prince, who alone comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the eſtate of publicke things.</p>

               <head>The Expoſition of the nine and twentieth Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe nine and twentieth Chapter which treateth of publiſhing a prohibition of bookes, ſince the agreement of the yeare 1596. ſtands in force, there can no doubt be made of it. But it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſider, that the agreement being made with ſo much conſideration and maturity, as well of the Apoſtolicall Seas ſide, as of the moſt renowned Common-wealths ſide; the matter ought to be held of weight. This conference laſted foure Moneths, on the Pontificiall ſide there was the Cardinall, the Nuntio, and the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and on the other ſide the chiefe Senators of the Common-wealth, cleare arguments, that the buſineſſe on both ſides was held to be of great weight: and nevertheleſſe, though it was determined by common conſent, yet did it not take away all hope from the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Perſons, to have it forgotten againe and out of uſe: Wherefore then they treated, that there ſhould bee but three ſcore coppies Printed of the agreement, for nothing elſe but becauſe there being an innumerable number of the coppies of the <hi>Indexes,</hi> of the forbidden bookes which paſſe through all mens hands, every one might ſee thoſe documents, which give the authority over the bookes to Eccleſiaſticall Perſons onely, but the moderation of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might not be knowne but by few, and ſo finally it might bee loſt. And treading theſe ſteps in <hi>Rome,</hi> there is not a yeare but there comes forth a Catalogue of new prohibition, under the name of the Maſter of the ſacred Palace, with clauſes that it ſhall take place in all Cities, Townes, and places of every Kingdome, Nation, or People; and that it ſhall bind all men, although there be no publication who ſhall come any way to have notice of the Edict. This <hi>Index</hi> is ſent to the Inquiſitors, that by meanes of the Confeſſors they may get them to worke the beſt effect they can: and by this meanes the agreement is deluded, and groweth out of uſe. And that which is worſe, when an <hi>Index</hi> is printed within this City, they doe endeavour to have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17288:37"/>
thoſe new prohibitions inſerted in them: which they alſo attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to doe this yeare. And if diligent care be not alwaies had, as it is at this preſent, they will one day ſet up a Court of Iuſtice, and open a way to the deſtruction of the agreement. Their intents to make themſelves abſolute Maſters of Bookes, and the reſpects wherefore the Secular power hath neede to watch, to the end that they may not obtaine it, though they doe not appeare at firſt ſight, yet with an eaſie conſideration they are made manifeſt. The matter of Bookes ſeemes to be a thing of ſmall moment, becauſe it treats of words, but through theſe words comes opinions into the world, which cauſe partialities, ſeditions, and finally warres. They are words, it is true, but ſuch as in conſequence draw after them Hoſts ofarmed men. In this matter the <hi>Romans</hi> cannot hide two high pretences which they have.</p>
               <p>The firſt, that ſo they may prohibit bookes, not onely for cauſe of Religion, but alſo for any of her cauſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that the Prince ſhall not have power within his owne ſtate to forbid any bookes; for any cauſe whatſoever: and if that any be by them approved, the Prince cannot hinder, although he judge it to be dangerous, but that within his Dominions it may be had printed and publickly ſold. And theſe two pretences taking once effect, they ſhould doe the Temporall power wrong in three notable particulars.</p>
               <p>The firſt in prohibiting or corrupting Bookes which are good and profitable for the maintenance of a good government.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, in prohibiting of Bookes, which doe not belong to them to prohibit.</p>
               <p>The third, in hindring the Secular Power from removing what ſhall finde hurtfull to a good government.</p>
               <p>Of which three prejudices we ought to treate particulary, for to conſider of the remedies. About the firſt, concerning the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Bookes, which at <hi>Rome</hi> are not liked of, though they bee good and godly, becauſe they maintaine Temporall Power. It is a cleare thing, that a Prince, eſpecially one that ruleth with the Arts of Peace, uſeth this as a chiefe inſtrument to cauſe the people to beleeve this to be a firme truth, <hi>vid.</hi> that the Prince is ordained by God, and ruleth with Divine authority, and the Subject conſequently in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is bound to obey him, and not doing it, offendeth God: that the duty of undergoing publicke burthens, either perſonall in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring office, or reall in Tributes, Cuſtomes, or ſuch like, doth
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17288:38"/>
tye the Conſcience, and bindeth under the paine of ſinning to reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, he that refuſeth to beare them, or doth defraud them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Prince, by the Divine Law, is above any perſon that is within his Dominion, and may lay a burthen on any mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, when publicke neceſſity, according to his judgement, ſhall require it. Everyone of himſelfe, without any greater diſcourſe may judge how eaſily a State may be governed, where the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Maximes, as they are moſt true, ſhall be ſo beleeved to bee, and the diſorders which moſt neceſſarily happen where contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are held Oftheſe truths written by the Prophets, taught by Chriſt, and preached by the Apoſtles, ancient Fathers, bookes are alſo ſull and good Divines doe hold them, as they are neceſſary to be beleeved. But as there were alwayes in Gods Church, thoſe who made uſe of Religion, for worldly ends, ſo the number of them is now ſull. Theſe, under a ſpiritual pretence, but with an ambitious end and deſire of worldly wealth, would free themſelves from the obedience due unto the Prince, and take away the love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due by the people, to draw it to themſelves. To bring theſe things to paſſe, they have newly invented a Doctrine, which talkes of nothing but of Eccleſiaſticall greatneſſe, liberty, immunity, and of her juriſdiction. This Doctrine was unheard of, untill about the yeare of 1300. neither is there any booke found concerning it before that time: then did they beginne to write of it ſcatteringly in ſome bookes: but there were not above two bookes which treated of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but this, untill the yeare 1400. and three untill the yeare <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>500. After this time the number increaſed a little, but it was tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. After the yeare 1560. this Doctrine beganne to increaſe in ſuch manner, that they gave over writing, as they did before of the Myſteries of the moſt Holy Trinity, of the Creation of the World, of the incarnation of Chriſt, and other Myſteries of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and there is nothing printed in <hi>Italy,</hi> but Bookes in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of Secular Authority, and exhaltation of the Eccleſiaſticall, and ſuch Bookes are are not printed by ſmall numbers, but by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands: Thoſe people which have any learning can reade nothing elſe; the Confeſſors likewiſe know none other Doctrine, nor to bee approved of neede they any other Learning. Whence comes in a perverſe opinion univerſally, that Princes and Magiſtrates are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inventions, yea, and Tyranicall, that they ought onely by compulſion to be obeyed, that the diſobeying of Lawes, and defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the publicke revenewes doth not binde one unto ſinne, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17288:38"/>
to puniſhment; and he that doth not pay if he can but flye from it, remaines not guilty before the Divine Majeſty; and contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that every becke of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, without any other thought, ought to be taken for a Divine Precept, and binds the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. And this Doctrine perchance is the cauſe of all inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which are felt in this Age. There want not in <hi>Italy</hi> pious and learned perſons which hold the truth, but they are not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to write, nor to print: Something comes written from another place, but preſently it is prohibited: And little thought is taken of Hereticall Books, eſpecially thoſe that treate of the Articles of Faith; but if any one comes that defends the Prince his Temporall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſaith that Eccleſiaſticall perſons are alſo ſubject to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke functions, and puniſhable if they violate the publicke tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, theſe are condemned bookes, and perſecuted more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They have gelded the bookes of ancient Authors by new printing of them, and taken out all which might ſerve for Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall authority.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1607. they printed in <hi>Rome</hi> with publicke authority, a Booke intituled <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> where they did note the places which in divers Authors ought to be cancelled, in which book every one may with eyes behold what things are taken away or changed in many good Authors, which did defend the Authority given by God to the Prince. So that at this preſent in reading of a Booke, a man can no more finde what the Authors meaning was, but onely what is the Court of <hi>Romes,</hi> who hath altered every thing. And that above all things would be thought incredible, if it were not ſeene in Print.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, in the yeare 1595. in the <hi>Index</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a rule, that all Catholicke Writers Bookes, written after the yeare 1515, might be corrected and amended, not onely by taking away what is not conformable to the Doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo with adding to it. This Precept hath beene put in practice and executed continually theſe ſeventy yeares, though it hath beene done publickly but ſome few yeares ſince. So that if in Authors wee finde no good Doctrine favouring Temporall authority, wee know who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it away. If wee finde any that favoureth the Eccleſiaſticall, we know who hath put it in and finally, we may be aſſured to have no booke true. Wherefore ſince the onely aime is to extinguiſh or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thoſe Bookes by which onely well minded men might receive neceſſary inſtruction: The Secular Magiſtrate ought alſo to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpected,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17288:39"/>
and not ſuffer himſelfe under faigned pretexts to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of more than heretofore hee hath beene: and when new mention is made of prohibiting any booke which treateth not of Articles of Beliefe, to informe himſelfe well of the Doctrine which it containes, and of the ends for which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would forbid it, before he gives his conſent: And if any good and famous Authors Booke ſhould be new Printed, to ſee that the good Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes be not taken out, or new ones inſerted, contrary to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors intention. Yea, publicke ſervice, juſtice, and honeſty, would require that good Maximes ſhould bee printed againe: and that thoſe Bookes which have beene corrected by taking away or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering things favouring Temporall Authority given by God, ſhould againe be reſtored according to the firſt and uncorrupted Coppies, according to the Authors meaning. And becauſe by new prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſent out under hand, the force of the agreement may not be deluded or diminiſhed, when the Index of the yeare 1595. is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the agreement alſo ſhould be printed at the end of it. Taking notice of the prohibiting of Bookes, is not onely neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the extinguiſhing of good Doctrine in <hi>Italy,</hi> which beginneth now to be done, but alſo becauſe that under the pretence of good, the Inquiſition may not uſurpe that authority which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it; forbidding of Bookes, which though they be evill, yet have nothing to doe with Religion, which is the ſecond preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſticals have declared unto us that they prohibit books for eleven cauſes, of which there be five that doe in no wiſe belong unto them.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them is, when the Booke containeth any thing againſt his neighbouts reputation, eſpecially Eccleſiaſticall Perſons or Princes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, if it containes any thing againſt Eccleſiaſticall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, immunity, and juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The third, if with politick propoſitions of ancient Princes, or Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, they favour tyranny.</p>
               <p>The fourth, if the Booke containes conceites, or quippes againſt any ones reputation.</p>
               <p>The fifth, if they containe laſciviouſneſſes, and other things againſt honeſty.</p>
               <p>There is no queſtion, but thoſe Bookes wherein ſuch abſurdneſſes are found ought to be condemned: but every one may not doe it,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17288:39"/>
it were breeding a confuſion in the World, if every one who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an order to be good, might Decree it: That belongeth to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke authority, which onely can make a Law upon that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to her Government. He that is zealous and ſeeth the evill which is in a booke, let him procure the ſuppreſſing of it, and hee doe well, by his authority that may lawfully doe it.</p>
               <p>The diligence in ſeeking out and diſcovering of an evill is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, but to goe about to remedy it, when it doth not belong unto him is uſurpation and ambition. If by a booke the neighbours reputation bee touched, though he bee an Eccleſiaſticall man it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the Inquiſition to right it. That Office is againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and is not to protect any mans reputation. The Secular power is protector of mens honours, and he is to defend it, and to puniſh any one that doth wrong it with deeds, words, or writings. Let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition be carefull, that by bookes there is no Doctrine ſowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Faith; and God hath provided a Magiſtrate to give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy if by deeds, words, or bookes, any mans reputation is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If Eccleſiaſticall Perſons doe ſee any injury done to themſelves or to others, it is juſt that they may crave the Magiſtrates helpe, and expect amends through him. If any thing bee written againſt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall liberty and immunity, becauſe it is enjoyed by privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the Princes; it belongeth to the Prince to maintaine it to them, as farre as the publicke Service will permit: it were not good that every priviledged Perſon might out of his owne power defend his priviledges. Would God there were Bookes which might deſerve prohibition for being againſt Eccleſiaſticall liberty, rather than Bookes that doe deſerve it; for extending it ſo farre as it doth confound all government: It uſurpeth and taketh away that which belongeth to the Secular, and ſhameth Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which is for Celeſtiall things, and not to become maſters of Terreſtriall, committed by God unto others. It is not a leſſer but a greater evill to extend Eccleſiaſticall liberty ſo farre, as it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come irregular, then to reſtraine it more than it ought to bee. What is the cauſe that no booke is cenſured? Becauſe it vaunts it too much, and taketh away the temporall. The beſt way to maintaine it is not to prohibite thoſe bookes which keepes it within the bounds, but rather thoſe which doe make it hideous for the abſurdneſſe of it: wherefore it ought not to bee denyed, but if any one ſhould write in this behalfe contrary to truth, the Magiſtrate ought to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the author and the booke, and obſerve the decency and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17288:40"/>
due to the Eccleſiaſticall order; but it is not juſt that they ſhould right themſelves. If politicke things be written, according to the maximes of Princes, and ancient Hiſtoriographers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all mens opinions it belongeth not to the Eccleſiaſticall to judge of them: if they be tirannicall that belongeth onely to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whom is proper the Government of States. Private men doe not underſtand it, and much leſſe the Miniſters of Chriſt, to whom is ſeverely forbidden to entermeddle in it; and if any one will goe further, hee muſt not thinke to remedy it with his owne authority, but to ſignifie it to him, to whom it belongs to helpe it. As it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo moſt plaine that thoſe who deſire to have an unreſiſtioned liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doe give the name of Tiranny to the lawfull power given by God, &amp; to that Doctrine which oppoſeth it ſelf to their attempts: ſo that under pretence of Religion they will become arbitrators of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. The ſame is to be ſaid of bookes containing conceites, or biting quippes, which directly, or indirectly doe offend in any one, and if they doe teach ill manners, laciviouſneſſe, ſurfeits, which offend the publicke dignity; none of theſe exceſſes is Hereſie, that they ſhould belong to the Inquiſition. The Inquiſitor is made a Iudge of the beleefe, and not a cenſurer of manners. By St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine publicke quiet, and honour are given into the cuſtody of Secular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, the Inquiſition ought not to put her ſickle into another mans harveſt. This concluſion needs no ſubtilneſſe to make it bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of it ſelfe it is plaine and eaſie. To the ſame man belongeth to judge and puniſh deeds, words, and writings of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, none can make queſtion but that the offending of ones reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, favouring of Tiranny, and diſhoneſty, either with deeds, or with words, are offences ſubject to the Secular Iudgement: Therefore thoſe which are committed in writing alſo, ſhall belong to the ſame. By what reaſon can he pretend to cenſure the bookes of any of the foreſaid cauſes, who confeſſeth of himſelfe to have no power to cenſure the words, and the deeds? Since that by the Princes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſuch a diſorder is put in practiſe, <hi>vid.</hi> that under pretence of favroring honeſty, and Iuſtice, and preſerving a good name, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall authority comes to bee uſurped: peradventure becauſe it is a very new thing, that the Eccleſiaſticall power ſhould prohibite bookes for any other cauſe beſides that of Religion, ſince no Pope ever attempted it before the yeare 1550. therefore as a freſh thing, it hath not yet beene well examined; or becauſe that ſome who give attendance upon publicke affaires, thinke it not ill to diſcharge
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17288:40"/>
themſelves of this burthen of looking over bookes, and leave it to them as deſire it. But as every Government requires watchfulneſſe and carefulneſſe, and he that diſcharges himſelfe of theſe, diſpoileth himſelfe alſo of his authority, and doth not perceive it till it be loſt, and cannot be recovered againe; ſo the moſt renowned Common-wealth, which hath ordered that her Officers ſhould over-ſee every booke which is Printed, to prevent any inconvenient Doctrine from comming to light, hath knowne very well that this care belongeth to the Prince, and thence is neceſſarily inferred that his Deputies ought alſo to ſee whether that there be any inconveniences in bookes already printed, which may hinder the reprinting of them. To the ſame Perſon belongeth the preventing of evill, to whom the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of an evill already ſprung belongeth. If the Prince may Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by the authority he hath from God, forbid the printing of a booke becauſe it containes blaſphemy againſt the God-head, favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Tiranny, offends publicke honeſty, teacheth evill manners, or takes away another mans authority and reputation: Hee may alſo Lawfully and by the ſame authority prohibit them that are already printed, and doe containe the like inconveniences.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Index</hi> of the bookes made in the yeare 1595. is already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with publicke authority by agreement; therefore the bookes contained in it, are to be prohibited without exception. But if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after it be propounded by Eccleſiaſticall Perſons to have bookes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite for any of the aforeſaid reaſons, it muſt not be granted that they ſhould doe it, but notice may be taken, and the booke prohibited by Temporall authority onely, leaving it to the Eccleſiaſticall power onely, when the booke is prohibited for cauſe of Religion. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the third prejudice which is new, but of greater annoyance than the other two: becauſe that to bee deprived of ones authority, and to loſe good bookes, are indeede very great evils, but tollerable in reſpect of this, to be conſtrained to endure within their owne Dominions, a booke knowne to bee hurtfull. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> though it hath aſſumed to itſelfe to prohibite bookes, alſo for cauſes which concerned not Religion, and did not belong to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power, yet before theſe laſt yeares they have not dared to goe ſo farre as to ſay, that the Prince may not alſo forbid thoſe bookes which he ſeeth doe breede ſcandall, evill example, ſedition or other perturbance within his Dominion.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> would be the firſt that ſhould free this paſſe, and ſpeake it boldly, who being conveniently oppoſed by that Prince
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17288:41"/>
who was particularly touched, none ever ſince hath dared to this houre to maintaine the Cardinall his enterprize. But becauſe hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome may attempt the like with greater Art, or upon an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, when mens eyes ſhall not be ſo open; the buſineſſe being of ſuch moment requireth to have the ſucceſſe of that buſineſſe briefly ſet downe, for a generall example and document, adding thereunto the true Doctrine, with her Grounds, anſwering the objected cavillations.</p>
               <p>That Cardinall in the beginning of the yeare 1605. printed his eleventh <hi>Tome</hi> of the Eccleſiaſticall Annals, wherein hee inſerted a very long diſcourſe againſt the Monarchie of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Of which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe what concerneth the Truth of the relation, is not fitting now to be ſpoken of, but to be left to his proper place: This onely belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the preſent purpoſe, that the diſcourſe is full of ſlanders, and eagerneſſe againſt many Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> of famous memory, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially againſt King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholicke, and the progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on the Fathers ſide of him who now Reigneth. The booke comming to <hi>Naples,</hi> and to <hi>Milan,</hi> was by the Kings Officers there prohibited, that it ſhould not be ſold, nor had there for the reſpects of their Prince, which were too apparent to every vulgar perſon. The Cardinall having notice of it, aſſembled the Colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals in the vacancy of the Sea of <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, and made an invictive againſt thoſe Officers, that in prohibiting of that booke had laid hands on Eccleſiaſticall authority. And afterwards when <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth was made Pope, he writ unto the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> a long Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dated the 13. of <hi>June</hi> in the ſame yeare, with this conclufion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt. That to the Pope onely belongeth the approving of bookes of all kinds, much more Eccleſiaſticall ones, complaining greatly that in contempt of Eccleſiaſticall authority, the Kings Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in <hi>Italy</hi> had prohibited his booke. The wiſedome of that King thought it beſt to anſwer with deeds, and let the prohibition runne on which was publiſhed by his Officers. The Cardinall could not containe himſelfe, but that printing his 12. <hi>Tome</hi> in the yeare 1607. he muſt inſert to ſmall purpoſe, a diſcourſe of the ſame matter, ſaying formally, that it was an impious and abhominable thing, that in theſe our moſt unfortunate dayes, the Kings Officers ſhould dare to cenſure bookes approved by the Pope, not ſuffering them to bee ſold by the Booke-ſellers, but with their Licence, which they would grant but when they pleaſed; yea, and would abſolutely forbid the ſale of them: that they doe it becauſe the bookes rebuke their unjuſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17288:41"/>
acts, and that it was to take out of St. <hi>Peters</hi> hands, and putting into the Princes, one of the Keyes given him by Chriſt, <hi>vid.</hi> that of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to diſcerne good cuſtomes from bad. The Counſell of <hi>Spaine</hi> proceeded ſtill with their wonted ſtaidneſſe and reſolution, nor did not move for the third time, but let three yeares more run on. And in the yeare 1610. the King made an Edict, whereby hee condemned and forbad the booke in ſo grave a manner, that hee aptly touched Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> as well as he had touched the Kings his Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors. And to give it the more credit and force, he cauſed the Edict to be publiſhed in <hi>Sicily</hi> with a Decree, and ſubſcribed by Cardinall <hi>Doria;</hi> and was ſent in print all the World over. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtood amazed, as well for the Edict, as for the execution of it done by the Cardinall, yet in <hi>Spaine</hi> they moved not a whit, and the Edict remaineth ſtill in force. Certainly there cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a higher enterprize, than to ſend into a Prince his Dominions, a booke in print againſt his Government, and to pretend it to bee Lawfull, and that the booke ſhall be there read, kept and ſold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely, and that the Prince ſhall have no power to diſcover it and withſtand it; and that under colour of Religion, and the authority of Chriſt given to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Which pretence will be taken away if we doe but marke the Catholicke Doctrine, and the cuſtome of the holy Church, whence the truth plainly appeares, and Cardinall <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> his reaſons are plainely confuted. It is a thing well knowne, that unto St. <hi>Peter</hi> were given the Keyes of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; that many holy Fathers and Catholick Writers, meanes by the Keyes in the Plurall number, the one of Knowledge, and the other of Power; and that the power ought not to be underſtood Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, but onely concerning the Kingdome of Heaven, which is the Spirituall; for the Civill, Royall and Temporall power is expreſly forbidden him by Chriſt. So the Knowledge is not to be underſtood of naturall things, nor of corrections, much leſſe of Politicke, Civill, or Morall things; but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith plainely, they are made diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencers of Chriſts miſteries onely: Wherefore if by the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall authority a booke be approved to be good in matters of Faith, it cannot be condemned as bad, by any Secular power: but if the booke treateth of other matters, as of juriſdiction, of Government, of Merchandize, although it were applauded by all the Prelates of the World, yet doth not that prejudice Temporall authority, but that it may be condemned. It is a great wrong to pretend that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath given St <hi>Peter</hi> the Cogniſance, and power of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17288:42"/>
Kingdome of Heaven, and forbidden him the Earthly; one may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his precept extend ſpirituall things to temporall. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> often ſaith, that grace doth not deſtroy nor take any thing away from nature, but leaving all her owne unto her, doth adde unto it Divine perfections. The Temporall power hath of its owne nature power to forbid all things which are repugnant to publicke quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to honeſty; and amongſt the reſt writings, and bookes which are contrary to it. Chriſt is not come to take away any of this authority from the Magiſtrates, but to leave it intire; onely he addes power to his Miniſters, over things concerning Chriſtian Faith, of which men by nature know nothing, but onely by Revelation: Therefore theſe ought not to aſſume unto themſelves the power of approving of bookes which belong not to them, or to endeavour to deprive the Magiſtrate, of the authority which is given them by God, and by nature.</p>
               <p>Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> alleadgeth the Epiſtles of certaine Writers, who have dedicated unto Popes their bookes of Hiſtories, or of Law, or of concerning Government; and have ſubmitted their Workes to the Popes cenſure: and therefore he concludes, that to him alone belongeth to approve of all ſorts of bookes, and that once approved by him, none ought any further to meddle with it. But this is but a vaine reaſon, ſince it doth not make any diſtinction betweene Obligatory &amp; binding words, and words of compliment. Who ever Dedicateth a Booke not onely to a Prince, but alſo to a private man, but that he will ſubmit it unto him, and that with ſome Hyperbole of words. If we ſhall upon theſe Rethoricall colours ground Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Divinity, we will alſo finde other Epiſtles, which wee will give the ſame power to all manner of Perſons: and wee ſhall finde many bookes of Phiſicke, and of Grammar Learning, Dedicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Popes, with ſuch like phraſes of ſpeaking; and ſhould that inferre therefore that the Papacy is an Office concerning health, or a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Schoole? Reverence and civill ſpeaking is one thing, and that which muſt bee holden as an Article of Faith is another: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Baronius</hi> taxeth the Princes Officers with forbidding of bookes, becauſe they reprove their unjuſt dealings, it will be good to ſpeake a word concerning that; becauſe it ſhall not ſeeme that we will have unjuſt things defended, nor that any ſhould thinke that it is Lawfull under colour of reproving of things, to diſturbe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke quietneſſe. One may ſpeake two wayes of a miſdeede; by way of Theſis, or Poſition, <hi>vid.</hi> in generall without touching either Perſon,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17288:42"/>
or place; or time: and to reprove in this manner, hath bin alwayes held good for the rooting out of vice: It is Lawfull for any one to write bookes in this manner. Another way is by <hi>Hipotheſis,</hi> that is of particular caſe, naming of Perſons and other circumſtances, and that is not permitted to any but to the Lawfull Judge. Every one may write againſt Uſury in generall, but to touch any particular inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for uſury, belongeth to none but to the publicke Judge; and the doing otherwiſe, is to put the World in a confuſion, leaving the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of buſineſſes unto unjuſt perſons. A generality may eaſily bee conſidered of, and hath neede of nothing but of ſtudy and authors; but a particularity by reaſon of the infiniteneſſes of circumſtances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an exquiſite prudence and experience. It is eaſie to ſay, and to prove in generall, that the uſurping the Soveraignty of a State is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; and Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> might have thereupon made a long Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis. But to come to a particular, and ſay that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> uſurpes the Soveraignty of <hi>Sicily,</hi> is not a cauſe belonging to him. And if the Kings Officers in <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> have therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited his booke, they have not forbidden the reproving of unjuſtice, but rather the ſmall wiſedome of him who judgeth the preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Sicily</hi> to be unjuſt, without having ſo much knowledge as was needfull for the doing of it. And if the Pope did approve the booke, intending to doe it for the places Eccleſiaſticall Dominion and State, it is well: but if he did meane it alſo for other Princes States, ſo that it might not be prohibited by thoſe who held it ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, that had beene an exceſſe, and uſurpation of other mens au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which ought not to be ſuppoſed of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, who was a wiſe Prince. And becauſe Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> addes, that publicke Officers cannot prohibit Booke ſellers, to ſell bookes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Licence, under pretence of hindering Hereticall bookes from comming in with falſe Titles, becauſe that ſeeing ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they ought with humbleneſſe to ſeeke that the Biſhops may doe it: this alſo deſerves a little conſideration. And firſt, to take away all ambiguity; neither did any approve of doing any thing under a fained pretence, that is, to cover evill with the colour of good, this being a pernicious diſſimulation; but to ſet up one good thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind another, to cauſe it to paſſe without naming of it to make the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it eaſie, or for ſome other end, is not to be reproved; and the Holy Scripture doth give infinite examples of it. If an Edict were made by a Secular Magiſtrate, that no Booke-ſeller ſhould ſell bookes without Licence, becauſe Hereticall bookes ſhould not come in;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17288:43"/>
having an intent that way, to hinder not onely Hereticall, but all other kind of evill bookes alſo, it were not a thing to be reproved; neither had the Cardinall any reaſon to enveigh againſt ſo juſt a thing. But it is worſe when he ſaith that they muſt have a recourſe to the Biſhop, for that would bee a moſt unperfect Government which in it ſelfe had not a meanes to provide for a thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſhould ſtay for a remedy from him that ſhould give it according to his proper intereſts, and not according to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke neceſſity. In matter of bookes wee ought to diſtinguiſh, that it is one thing to judge whether a booke bee Hereticall or no, which belongeth to Chriſts Miniſters onely, neither hath Secular power any part therein. And another thing it is when a booke is knowne by the Church to bee Hereticall, to forbid it by Law, which is not ſo proper to the Eccleſiaſticall, but that it may very laudable bee done by the Secular power.</p>
               <p>In the Primative Church, Hereticall bookes were examined, and declared to be ſuch by the Counſels, but not prohibited by them but by the Prince. The firſt Counſell of <hi>Nice,</hi> condemned of Hereticall Doctrine of <hi>Arius,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did forbid his bookes by Imperiall Law.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Counſell of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> did declare <hi>Eunomias</hi> to be a Hereticke. The Emperour <hi>Arcadius</hi> did prohibit the bookes of the <hi>Eunomians</hi> by a Law, which is in the <hi>Theodoſian</hi> Code.</p>
               <p>The third Counſell of <hi>Epheſus</hi> declared <hi>Neſtorius</hi> to be an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and his bookes were forbidden by a Law of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> which is in the body of the Civill Lawes.</p>
               <p>The fourth Counſell of <hi>Calcedon</hi> condemned the <hi>Entichians,</hi> and their bookes were forbiden by a Law of the Emperour <hi>Martian</hi> who is in the ſame foreſaid booke. This was the manner of the ancient Church, untill the yeare 800. ſince which time the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have declared divers Writers to be Hereticks. And the Princes have let that Declaration paſſe without any other Law of theirs: but it is not therefore to be ſaid that they have deprived themſelves of their authority of forbidding things hurtfull to their State. A Hereticall booke offends the Church, and diſturbs a peaceable life. The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is ſpirituall belongeth to the Eccleſiaſticall, to diſcerne good bookes from evill, and to the Secular, as Protector of the Church to helpe it. But for the ſecond reſpect to withſtand novelties for the publicke repoſe, the Secular ought not to truſt to other mens care, nor have recourſe to any one; but to abound in care, forbidding all what may in any reſpect hurt a good Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:17288:43"/>
It ought to be held for an undoubted concluſion, that the Secular power may forbid within its owne juriſdiction, any booke though approved by any other, and beſides his power hee ought alſo watchfully to conſider, what danger it is if his ſubjects doe ſwallow any opinion which is repugnant to good Government. I will alſo put it in remembrance, that as it is a great good to the Common-wealth, to have every booke that is to be printed, examined with ſuch care, as is accuſtomed in this State, ſo it would not be of leſſe good, to have every booke which is printed abroad, and brought hither examined before it be ſold. It is a folly to thinke that the Common-wealth may be damnified by the printing of an evill booke, and not if it be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in another place, and ſo ſcattered abroad. It is true, that ſome things may be ſuffered in one that is already printed, which would not be ſuffered in one which is not printed. But things of importance ought equally to be handled, as well in thoſe that are printed, as in thoſe that are to print. And as it is ſometimes wiſedome in the prohibiting of a booke which is printed without the State, to doe it with ſilence, onely intimating it to the Booke-ſellers, to not have the buſineſſe regarded nor ſpoken of, ſo it ſhould bee my reſpectfull advice, that ſometimes about bookes which are very pernicious, it ſhould bee done by Edict and writing, for that would bee a putting in practiſe, the proper authority, and not giving way to them who ſay, that prohibiting of bookes is a thing properly, Eccleſiaſticall, and that would alſo accuſtome the people to it: For if the exerciſing of that authority bee put off till ſome moſt urgent or moſt dangerous caſe ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, it would run in danger of being thought to bee a novelty, and ſo bee diſobeyed.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary before wee come out of this matter, to adde, that ſome others who have not dared to ſpeake ſo great an abſurdity as <hi>Baronius</hi> did, have ſtumbled upon another not much leſſer; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Prince may prohibit bookes, as ſeditious, diſhoneſt or infamous: but adding thereunto, that this prohibition ought to be obeyed for feare of temporall puniſhment, and not becauſe it ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the conſcience: ſo that he that reades them, or keepes them ſecret is not culpable before God. This is a falſe and perverſe opinion, and contrary to Chriſtian Doctrine. St. <hi>Paul</hi> with precepts and plaine words ſaith, that every one is bound to obey temporall power, not onely becauſe of the puniſhment, but for conſcience ſake. When one commands any thing, having not power from God, he that doth not obey him,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17288:44"/>
him doeth not offend his Divine Majeſty. But diſobeying in that wherein the authority commeth from God, hee himſelfe comes to be diſobeyed and offended.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who hath beene often alledged, but never enough, ſaith, that God hath given the Prince charge of tranquillity, quietneſſe, piety, and honeſty: and if for theſe reſpects the Prince prohibits a booke becauſe it is ſeditious, another becauſe it is impious, another becauſe it is diſhoneſt; it cannot be ſaid without contradicting St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that every one is not bound in conſcience to obey. If it would pleaſe God to open the eyes of many, to bring to paſſe that this Doctrine as it is true and Chriſtian, ſo it might be taught; and the contrary as pernicious ſhould be confuted, innumerable inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences would ceaſe, which wee doe now ſee daily: Becauſe if there be ſome in the World who doe worke for the love of honeſty, the great number of the reſt is divided into two ſorts. The one ſort are they who doe well for feare of ſpirituall puniſhments, and the other for feare of temporall puniſhments. When ſpirituall feare is taken away, their obedience is loſt who thinke that they ſhall lye concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſhall through favour and other meanes, hinder and eſchew the puniſhment: And thoſe alſo which doe make no account of it, which both put together doe make a great number. On the other ſide let us behold, how eaſily ſome are brought to obedience, through a ſpirituall feare. Since God then hath given the Prince theſe two meanes to cauſe him to bee obeyed, <hi>vid.</hi> for feare of temporall puniſhments, and for conſcience ſake; for ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, it were a great loſſe to forgoe the ſecond of theſe meanes, which is not leaſt neceſſary, with letting the contrary bee ſpread abroad contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Catholicke Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Recapitulating then the heads gathered in this matter of bookes, they will be ten. The firſt that thoſe which are contained in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> of the yeare 1595. what cauſe ſoever they are prohibited for, the Princes conſent having bin to it, are alwayes to be held for ſuch. The ſecond, that for the time to come no prohibition bee ſuffered, what clauſe ſoever there be in it; although it bee with cenſure, if it be not admitted by publicke authority as it was agreed. The third, that if the Eccleſiaſticall ſhall deſire the publicke conſent, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of bookes which treate of matters of Faith, ſo they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, their propoſition being verified ſhall be agreed unto. The fourth that heede ſhall be alwayes taken, that under pretence of Religion, Chriſtian Doctrine be not forbidden, which defends
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17288:44"/>
temporall authority. The fifth, that it ſhall not bee granted to the Inquiſitor to prohibit bookes for any other cauſe but onely of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but if any behad for any other reſpects, it ſhall be prohibited by the Magiſtrate. The ſixt, that books printed elſewhere, though approved by any one elſe, by what authority ſoever; if they be hurtfull to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, they ſhall bee prohibited by the Secular Magiſtrate or by a publick Edict, according to the occaſion. The ſeventh, that in the printing againe of bookes heed be taken, that thoſe things be not taken away which favour temporall power. The eight, that if any of thoſe that are gelded, in which the Doctrine maintaining temporall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is taken out, be new printed, they ſhall be printed againe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old Coppies. The ninth, that if the <hi>Index</hi> of the yeare 1595, be new printed, care be taken that no new names be inſerted. The tenth, that together with the ſame <hi>Index,</hi> the agreement be printed.</p>
               <p>There remaines another poynt to be briefly touched in this matter which is not of ſo great importance, and yet ſuch, as of it ſelfe merits ſome conſideration. Which is, that the prohibition not being uſed with due moderation, is hurtfull to the ſale of bookes, and to the Art of printing; for if a booke be printed which hath bin ſeene by the Inquiſitor and the Biſhop, and by them approved, yet if at <hi>Rome</hi> any thing be found though of ſmall moment, not againſt Religion, for in ſuch a matter nothing can be of ſmall moment, but againſt ſomewhat touching the Court: which the Inquiſitor hath not entred into, who granted the Licence. They prohibit the booke, to his loſſe who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the booke to be printed, and is in no fault having the Inquiſitors approbation: and this diſorder is frequent, and would be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent if they did not feare that upon the Booke-ſellers complaints Princes would give eare unto it; for every Courtier to get credit ſheweth himſelfe carefull in marking the prejudices of the Court, and alſo the ſhadowes of them, not onely in bookes printed out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but in them alſo which are approved by the Inquiſition, and even in them which are printed in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe. It were juſt that if any thing were found contrary to Religion, in a booke printed with approbation, the charges ſhould be paid by him that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it, ſince the Booke-ſeller is not in fault. But if any thing bee found which for its owne proper reſpects is diſpleaſing to the Court, it ſeemeth not reaſonable that a prohibition ſhould be granted, which ſeemeth alſo to be ſo reſolved on by the agreement of the yeare 1595. when it ſaith, that for the time to come no bookes be prohibited but forraigne ones, or printed without Licence, or with falſe Licence,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17288:45"/>
although ſuch words might be cavilled upon, becauſe they have made no exception of Religion: but the agreement beeing Conſtrued in this Sence, cannot chuſe but bee Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

               <p>THe thirtieth and one and thirtieth Chapters which ſpeake of Secular Arts, and of Artificers faults, can never bee too exactly obſerved. Every well ordered Common-wealth when ſome cruell kinde of offence ariſeth, doth make a Magiſtrate a purpoſe to take notice of that onely, that the care of other things may not divert him. For this cauſe, in the Chriſtian Common-wealth, was the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Inquiſition appointed, which ſhould tend onely to the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Hereſie. It is moſt naturall for every one who hath the univerſall juriſdiction to put over many things to him that hath the particular juriſdiction, or ſuffer him to uſurpe it, and it uſeth to be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, becauſe of the great power that is given him, and becauſe that he who hath the univerſall juriſdiction, employed in many buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſometimes doth not give heede, and ſometimes (if he he not a man of good knowledge) thinkes that it is a helping of him, ſo that he doth not onely not withſtand the inconvenience, but doth favour it. A cauſe not belonging to him that hath the particular juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being once taken, ſerves for example to take it the ſecond time, and from divers times a Cuſtome is framed, which afterwards ſerves for a Law, and cannot be taken away without many difficulties, and the univerſall juriſdiction comes to be diminiſhed, and the way is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the diſturbing of the government. By theſe wayes and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Inquiſitors againſt Hereſie have not onely ſtrived to draw divers other cauſes to their Office, but alſo to appropriate unto themſelves the government of the trade of Bookes, and to command
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17288:45"/>
divers others alleadging therefore two kindes of reaſons: The one is, that they doe not command any new thing, and that which without their command ought to bee done; for if they doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne the Butcher that he ſhall not ſell fleſh in Lent, hee is bound without that to not ſell it; ſo that the command ement is an admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing them of their duties. So likewiſe they ſay that they doe not cauſe ſuch perſons to ſweare any thing, but what they are bound to doe. For if they cauſe Booke-ſellers to ſweare that they will not ſell prohibited Books, they are already tyde to doe it; ſo there is nothing done but to adde a greater provocation to performe their owne du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But this reaſon is cavillous, it being one thing to warne one of his duty, and another to command it him. The Preacher and the Confeſſor doe admoniſh, without uſurping others authority, becauſe they impoſe no penalty, nor uſe any meanes to make them obey; this is onely a teaching which is not joyned with conſtraining. That commanding which carryeth in conſequence a revenge againſt the diſobeyer, although it bee a thing which is due to be done, yet is it an act of ſuperiority and juriſdiction, which not being granted to the Inquiſitors, but onely in caſe of Hereſie, which they cannot doe it, without uſurping the univerſall juriſdiction. So to conſtrain one to ſweare a thing, although it be to be done, is alſo an act of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, though without the oath it ought for to be done. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon which they moſt frequently uſe, is yet more cavillous; They ſay that the judging of Hereſies, bringeth by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence all things annexed or depending of it, and that they doo not pretend to command any, nor cauſe them to ſweare nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, but onely in things conjoyned with Hereſie: becauſe that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies are taught in Bookes, it is neceſſary for them to command Booke-ſellers and others, through the hands of whom Bookes doe paſſe, and puniſh them which doe againſt it. In all theſe particulars it is moſt plaine to perceive what is juſt: Without doubt, to whom the judgement of a thing is committed, to him is alſo granted all which is joyned to it, ſo that it cannot be ſevered. Wherefore all which in ſuch manner is joyned with Hereſie, ought to bee judged by the Inquiſition, but that which of it owne nature is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, and may ſeverally bee judged, although by ſome farre fetcht Conſequence it might be joyned; in this manner every offence, yea, and every action might bee joyned with Hereſie.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:17288:46"/>
As for the matter of Bookes, thoſe alone which containe Hereſie, are ſubject to that Office, and thoſe booke-ſellers which doe keepe or ſell any, and theſe ought to be puniſhed by the Inquiſition: it doth not follow therefore that the Inquiſitor may burthen Booke-ſellers with receiving of viſites, to make Inventaries, to receive Licences, to ſell from them; and ſuch orders as they often attempt to make: Likewiſe to eate forbidden foode at forbidden times, is an evidence of an evill conceite in matters of Faith, and other circumſtances which are thereunto adjoyned, and the Office proceeds againſt him that is accuſed; but he hath nothing to doe with it that ſels the food or dreſſes it, becauſe that it is to be ſuppoſed that theſe doe it for their gaine. But becauſe the deſire of gaine is ſo unruled, that oftentimes exceeding, it doth induce men to commit things againſt honeſty, if any one ſhould ſell in ſuch manner as that it ſhould provoke to evill, or ſhould cauſe any other ſcandall, this is not joyned with Hereſie. The Magiſtrate without ſpeaking of Faith, or of Doctrine, may puniſh the fault, and give ſuch order as ſhall be neceſſary for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of honeſt, and of religious living; and according to the honour of the City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherein the Inquiſition may alſo practiſe her good zeale, in ſhewing the Magiſtrate the inconveniences which it ſees, and ſhewing them the remedy, and procuring alſo the puniſhment of offenders: but by the meanes of the ordinary Juſtice, to whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it belongeth.</p>

It was an ancient cuſtome that when the office of Inquiſition was newly ſetled in ſome place, they publiſhed firſt an Edict called of Grace, inviting within a certaine time every here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke to repentance, promiſing pardon; which time being paſt, they publiſhed another Edict called of Iuſtice, where all were warned who had any notice of any Hereticke, for to denounce him: This matter in our age hath been divers wayes proceeded in. Some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors when they have beene deputed into places where the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is already eſtabliſhed, have made theſe two Edicts at their comming into their Office, but this hath hapned but ſeldome. Others have made the ſecond of Iuſtice onely: and others have repeated it alſo many times beſides the firſt, and that was done for to adde ſome new thing which the accidents might bring along with them. If any Inquiſitor ſhould have a minde to publiſh the Edict of Grace, hee neede not be forbidden it, for it cannot prejudice temporall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor be burthenſome to the ſubject: onely one ought to take heede concerning the Edict of Iuſtice, for oftentimes they doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to inſert therein ſome commands to Booke-ſellers, Hoſts, or letters of Chambers; and they cover themſelves with ſaying, that it ſerveth onely to adviſe them, which muſt not be permitted them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to adviſe by Edict, Proclamation, or affixion, are ſignes of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority: and it is alſo a legall thing that he who warneth by Edict, may alſo puniſh the offenders. Wherefore if one will not grant them the puniſhing, they muſt not give them way to warne by Edict, in that particular where it nameth Hereticall blaſphemers, it muſt bee all

underſtood, as in the one and twentieth Chapter, and in that part which is againſt them who doe offend, the miniſters of the Office the denouncers, or the witneſſes, the adjoyned limitation muſt bee well marked, that is for deedes which concernes the ſaid Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an abuſe ſhould not be brought in, which hath bin often attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Inquiſitors, that they might alone doe Juſtice againſt their owne Officers, and againſt any as have bin once examined in that Office, and puniſh all them who doe offend them for what cauſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be: for this clauſe for deeds which concerne that Office, doth remove all difficulties. If any one offend a Miniſter of that Office, he ſhall not be comprehended, but ſhall be Iudged in the ordinary Court, and becauſe the caſe was aſſumed from the Inquiſition, it muſt plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, that the offence was done becauſe of the office: and any one may likewiſe call the ſame Miniſters into the ordinary Court for any other cauſe; and particularly for that cauſe which ſhall be unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the nine and thirtieth Chapter.</p>

               <p>THe laſt Chapter of Calumniators and falſe witneſſes, is of great conſideration, not ſo much to maintaine the proper juriſdiction, nor taking away that which belongs to others, as for the defence, &amp; protection of the ſubjects, which being granted by God to the Prince, when he ſuffereth them to be oppreſſed without juſtice, he grievouſly offends the Divine Majeſty. It is an ordinary cuſtome of the Office of Hereſie to puniſh very ſeldome times calumniators or falſe witneſſes, but excuſe them upon any the leaſt ſeemingneſſe that they can ſhew them, moved by a good intention, ſaying that it ought not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that in matters of faith a Chriſtian be moved for any bad end,

and if that they cannot avoyde the puniſhing of ſome, they do it with very ſlight puniſhments, and they are ſpirituall, that ſo other affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the puniſhment of theſe, might not feare to renounce, or to teſtifie. For thence it would follow, that many things would bee concealed which are diſcovered, doing great ſervice to the Faith, which ought to bee preferred to the puniſhment of them although they deſerved it. Whether this caution bee juſt or no, is a matter which muſt now be left out, and onely conſider that it is a great lightning and comfort to a wretch, that ſeeth himſelfe calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when there remaineth a way to-rele<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> they doe not uſe it. The Inquiſitors would not have the accuſed who have bin calumniated by no meanes have power to have recourſe to any other Tribunall, and ſo they write in their bookes, alleadging for reaſon, that the injury is done to that Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, to which that falſary hath not borne reſpect; and therefore it ought to be judged by it, and that it cannot bee judged but onely by a proceſſe framed in that Office, which is not juſt that it ſhould be remitted to other Courts: But contrariwiſe, other Doctors doe hold that calumny and falſe witneſſe being no Hereſie, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Inquiſition, but unto the ordinary ſuperior Court of the calumniator, or of the falſe witneſſe, and eſpecially becauſe theſe ought rather to be puniſhed with temporall puniſhments, of cutting off the Tongue or the head, than by the Inquiſition. Other more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Lawyers approving the reaſons on both ſides, diſtinguiſh, that the calumny or falſity, may either appeare out of the Proceſſe framed in the Office of the Inquiſition, without any new framing; as when the witneſſe (which happeneth often) goeth of himſelfe to revoke his ſaying, &amp; to aske pardon; &amp; in other like, which do notoriouſly appeare by the onely ſight of the Proceſſe, and in this caſe the judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Inquiſition, and the Inquiſitors reaſons doe prevaile. But if out of that Proceſſe the calumny cannot appeare, and there be neede of new inſtance and Proceſſe, either by complaint, or by office, the judgement belongs to the ordinary Court: which is effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the reaſons alleaged by the contrary part, becauſe that calumny &amp; falſity are not Hereſie, nor Eccleſiaſticall offences, but meerely Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: neither is there any neede of ſeeing the firſt Proceſſe, becauſe it is proceeded in with other inſtance, and other Proceſſe. This advice as well grounded, and without intereſt, ought to be put in practices.</p>
