            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We dare not except no not the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin her selfe; of whom although we say with <hi>S.

offered vp him selfe a sacrifice for sinne; <hi>sanctification,</hi> because he hath given vs his spirit; <hi>redemption,</hi> because he hath appointed a day to vindicate his children out of the hands of corruption, into liberty, which is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. How Christ is made <hi>wisedome,</hi> and how <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it may be declared, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occasion serveth. But how Christ is made the <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of men, we are nowe to declare.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There is a glorifying righteousnes of men in the world to come; as there is a iustifying and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteousnes here. The righteousnes wherwith we shalbe cloathed in the world to come, is both perfect &amp; inherent. That whereby here we are iustified, is perfect, but not inherent. That whereby we are sanctified, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, but not perfect. This openeth a way to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of that grand question, which hangeth yet in controversie, betweene vs &amp; the Church of Rome, about the matter of iustifying righteousnes.</p>

They teach as we do, that<note place="margin">Deus sine medi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

This grace they will haue to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21763:6"/>
applied by infusion: to the end that as the body is warm by the heate which is in the body; so the soule might be righteous by the inherent grace: which grace they make capable of increase, as the body may be more and more warme, so the soule more and more iustified, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as grace shall be augmented, the augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof is merited by good workes, as good works are made meritorious by it. Wherefore, the first receipt of grace in their divinity, is the first iustification; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease thereof, the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iustification. As grace may be increased by the merit of good workes: so it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished by the demerit of sinnes veniall; it may be lost by mortall sinne. In asmuch therefore as it is needfull in the one case to repaire; in the other: to recover the losse which is made: the infusion of grace hath her sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry after meales, for the which cause, they make many waies to apply the infusion of grace. It is applied to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants through baptisme, without either faith, or works and in them really it taketh away originall sinne, &amp; the punishment due vnto it: it is applied to Infidels and wicked men in the first iustification, through baptisme without works, yet not without faith; and it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way both sinnes actuall and originall together, withall whatsoever punishment eternall or temporall thereby deserved. Vnto such as haue attained the first iustification, that is to say, the first receipt of grace, it is applyed farther by good workes to the increase of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grace, which is the second iustification. If they worke more and more; grace doth more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and they are more and more iustified. To such as diminished it by veniall sinnes, it is applyed by holy

water, <hi>Ave maries,</hi> crossings, papall salutations, &amp; such like, which serue for reparations of grace decayed. To such as haue lost it through mortall sinne, it is applyed by the sacrament (as they terme it) of Pennance: which sacrament hath force to conferre grace anew, yet in such sort, that being so conferred it hath not altogither so much power as at the first. For it only cleanseth out the staine or guilt of sinne committed; and changeth the punishment eternall into a temporall satisfactory punishment, here, if time do serue; if not, hereafter to be indured, except it be lightened by masses, workes of charity, pilgrimages, fasts, and such like; or else shorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by pardon, for terme, or by plenary pardon quite removed, and taken away. This is the mistery of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinne. This maze the Church of Rome doth cause her followers to treade when they aske her the way to iustification. I cannot stand now to vnrip this building, and to sift it piece by piece; only I will passe by it in few words, that that may befall Babilon in the presence of that which God hath builded, as happened vnto <hi>Dagon</hi> before the arke.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Doubtlesse saith the Apostle <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 3. v. 8.</note>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21763:7"/>
for if he withdraw the breath of our nostrils we fall to dust: but the righteousnesse wherein we must be found if we wilbe iustified, is not our owne: therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be iustified by any inherent quality.

Let it bee counted folly, or frensie, or furie whatsoever; it is our comfort, and our wisdome; we care for no knowledge in the world but this: that man hath sinned and God hath suffered; that God hath made himselfe the sonne of man, and that men are made the righteousnesse of God. You see therefore that the Church of Rome in teaching iustification by inherent grace, doth pervert the truth of Christ, and that by the handes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles wee haue received otherwise then shee teacheth.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21763:8"/>
Now concerning the righteousnesse of sanctification, we deny it not to be inherent; wee graunt that vnlesse we worke, we haue it not: only we distinguish it a thing different in nature from the righteousnesse of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we are righteous the one way by the faith of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; the other way, except wee doe the workes of Abraham, we are not righteous. Of the one, S. Paule; <hi>To him that worketh not but beleeueth, faith is counted for</hi>

               <hi>iustus est:</hi> He is righteous which worketh righteousnes. Of the one, S. Paul doth proue by Abrahams example, that we haue it of faith without workes. Of the other, S. Iames, by Abrahams example, that by workes wee haue it, and not only by faith. S. Paul doth plainely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver these two parts of Christian righteousnes one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. For in the 6. to the Rom. thus hee writeth, <hi>Being freed from sinne, and made servants to God; yee haue</hi>

               <hi>your fruite in holinesse, and the end everlasting life. Yee are made free from sinne, and made servants vnto God:</hi> this is the righteousnesse of iustification: <hi>yee haue your fruite in holinesse;</hi> this is the righteousnesse of sanctification. By the one we are intressed in the right of inheriting; by the other we are brought to the actuall possession of eternall blisse, and so the end of both is everlasting life.</p>
            <p n="7">7 The Prophet Abak. doth here tearme the Iewes righteous men, not only because being iustified by faith they were free from sinne, but also because they hadde their measure of fruits in holines. According to whose example of charitable iudgement, which leaueth it to God to discerne what we are, and speaketh of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which they doe professe themselues to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21763:8"/>
be, although they be not holy men whom men doe thinke, but whom God doth know indeed to bee such: yet let every Christian man knowe, that in Christian e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, he standeth bound for to thinke and speake of his brethren, as of men that haue measure in the fruite of holinesse, and a right vnto the titles, wherewith God in token of speciall favour and mercy, vouchsafeth to honour his chosen servants. So we see the Apostles of our Saviour Christ, do evse every where the name of Saints; so the Prophet, the name of righteous. But let vs all be such as we desire to be tearmed. <hi>Reatus impij est pium nomen,</hi> saith <hi>Salvianus.</hi> Godly names, doe not iustifie godlesse men. Wee are but vpbraided when we are honored with names &amp; titles, wherevnto our liues &amp; manners are not sutable. If indeed we haue our fruit in holinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithstanding wee must note, that the more we abound therein, the more neede wee haue to craue that we may be strengthned and supported. Our very vertues may be snares vnto vs. The enimie that waiteth for all occasions to worke our ruine, hath fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it harder, to overthrow an humble sinner, then a proud Saint. There is no mans case so dangerous, as his whom Sathan hath perswaded, that his owne righteousnesse shall present him pure and blamelesse in the sight of God. If we could say we were not guilty of any thing at all in our consciences (we know our selues far from this innocencie; we cannot say we knowe nothing by our selues; but if we could,) should we therefore pleade not guiltie before the prefence of our iudge, that sees fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into our hearts, then we ourselues can doe? If our handes did never offer violence to our brethren, a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21763:9"/>
bloody thought, doth proue vs murderers before him; if we had never opened our mouth to vtter any scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, offensiue, or hurtfull word, the cry of our secret cogitations is heard in the eares of God. If we doe not commit the sinnes which dayly and hourely, either in deed, word, or thoughts, wee doe commit: yet in the good things which we do, how many defects are there intermingled? God in that which is done, respecteth the mind &amp; intention of the doer. Cut of then all these things wherein wee haue regarded our owne glory, those things which men doe to please men, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our owne liking, those things which we doe by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respect, not sincerely, &amp; purely for the loue of God: and a smal score wil serue for the number of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous deeds. Let the holiest and best thing we doe, bee considered: we are never better affected vnto God, then when we pray; yet when we pray, how are our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many times distracted? How little reverence do we shew vnto the grand maiestie of God vnto whom wee speake? How little remorse of our owne miseries? How little taste of the sweet influence of his tender mercies doe we feele? Are we not as vnwilling many times to begin, and as glad to make an end; as if in saying, <hi>call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me,</hi> he had set vs a very burdensome taske? It may seeme somewhat extreame which I will speake: therefore let every one iudge of it, even as his owne heart shall tell him, and no otherwise; I will but onely make a demaund. If God should yeeld vnto vs, not as vnto Abraham; if fiftie, fortie, thirtie, twentie, yea or if ten good persons coulde bee found in a citty, for their sakes that citty should not be destroyed: but an if hee
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21763:9"/>
should make vs an offer thus large; Search all the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of men, sithence the fall of our father Adam, finde one man that hath done one action which hath past from him pure, without any staine or blemish at al; and for that one mans one only action, nether man nor Angell, shall feele the torments which are prepared for both: doe you thinke that this ransome to deliver men and Angels, could be found to be among the sonnes of men? The best things which we doe, haue somewhat in them to be pardoned. How then can wee doe any thing meritorious, or worthy to be rewarded? Indeed God doth liberally promise whatsoever appertained to a blessed life, to as many as sincerely keepe his lawe, though he be not exactly able to keepe it. Wherefore we acknowledge a dutifull necessity of doing well; but the meritorious dignity of doing well, wee vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. We see how far we are from the perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of the law; the little fruite which wee haue in holinesse, it is, God knoweth, corrupt and vnsound: we put no confidence at all in it, we challenge nothing in the world for it, we dare not call God to reckning, as if we had him in our debt bookes: our continuall suite to him, is and must be, to beare with our infirmities, and pardon our offences.</p>

Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem is a sinfull polluted Cittie: but Ierusalem compared with Babilon is righteous. And shall the righteous be overborne, shal they be compast about by the wicked? But the Prophet doth not only complaine; Lorde how commeth it to passe, that thou handlest vs so hardly; of whom thy name is called; and bearest with the heathen nations that dispise thee?

The example of our fathers may not retaine vs in communion with that church; vnder hope, that we so continuing, may be saved as well as they. God I doubte not, was mercifull to saue thousands of them, though they lived in Popish superstitions, in asmuch as they sinned ignorantly. But the truth is now laide before our eies.

            <p n="11">11 First for the plagues being threatned vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are partakers in the sinnes of Babylon, wee can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21763:11"/>
nothing concerning our fathers, out of this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: vnlesse we shew what the sinnes of Babylon bee, and what they bee which are such partakers of them, that their everlasting plagues are inevitable. The sinnes which may bee common both to them of the Church of Rome, and to others departed thence, must bee seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this question. He which saith, <hi>Depart out of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, least you be partakers of her sinnes:</hi> sheweth plainly, that he meaneth such sinnes, as, except we separate our selues, we haue no power in the world to avoid, such im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pieties, as by the law they haue established, &amp; wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that are among them, either doe indeed assent, or else are by powerable meanes, forced, in shew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance, to subiect themselues. As for example, in the Church of Rome it is maintained, that the same credit and reverence that wee giue to the Scriptures of God, ought also to be given to vnwritten verities; that the Pope is supreame head ministeriall over the vniversall Church militant; that the bread in the Eucharist is transubstantiated into Christ; that it is to be adored, &amp; to be offered vp vnto God as a sacrifice propitiatorie for quicke and dead; that Images are to bee worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; Saints to be called vpon as intercessors, and such like. Now, because some heresies doe concerne things only beleeved, as the transubstantiation of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall elements in the Eucharist: some concerne things which are practised and put in vre, as the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the elements transubstantiated: wee must note, that erroniously, the practise of that is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time received; whereof the doctrine that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, is not heretically maintained. They are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21763:12"/>
in the maintenance of heresies, who by worde or deed allow them, knowing them, although not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be heresies; as also they, and that most dangerously of all others, who knowing heresie to bee heresie, do notwithstanding in worldly respects, make semblance of allowing that, which in hart &amp; iudgment they condemne: but heresie is heretically maintained, by such as obstinately hold it, after holesome admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of the last sort, as of the next before, I make no doubt, but that their condemnation, without an actual repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is inevitable. Least any mantherefore should think, that in speaking of our fathers, I should speak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently of them all: let my words I beseech you bee wel marked; <hi>I doubt not but God was merciful to saue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of our fathers:</hi> which thing I will now by Gods as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance set more plainely before your eies.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Many are partakers of the error, which are not of the heresie of the Church of Rome. The people following the conduct of their guides, and observing as they did, exactly that which was prescribed, thought they did God good service, when indeed they did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonor him. This was their error: but the heresie of the church of Rome, their dogmatical positions oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site vnto Christian truth, what one man amongst ten thousand, did ever vnderstand? Of them which vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Romane heresies, and allow them, all are not alike partakers in the action of allowing. Some allow them as the first founders and establishers of them: which crime toucheth none but their Popes, and Councels; the people are cleare &amp; free from this. Of them which maintain popish heresies, not as authors, but receivers
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21763:12"/>
of them from others, all mainetaine them not as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. In this are not the people partakers neither, but only the predicauts and schoolemen. Of them which haue beene partakers in this sinne of teaching Popish heresie, there is also a difference; for they haue not all<note place="margin">Ver. 22.</note> beene teachers of all Popish heresies. <hi>Put a difference,</hi> saith S. Iude; <hi>haue compassion vpon some.</hi> Shall wee lay vp all in one condition? Shall we cast them all headlong? Shall we plunge them all into that infernall and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting flaming lake? Them that haue beene partakers of the errors of Babylon, together with them which are in the heresie? Them which haue beene the authors of heresie, with them that by terror and violence haue beene forced to receiue it? Them who haue taught it, with them whose simplicitie hath by sleights and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiances of false teachers, beene seduced to belieue it? Them which haue beene partakers in one, with them which haue bin partakers in many? Them which in many, with them which in all?</p>

Forasmuch therefore as it

may be said of the Church of Rome, shee hath yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle strength, shee doth not directly denie the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christianity: I may I trust without offence perswade my selfe, that thousands of our fathers in former times living and dying within her wals, haue founde mercy at the hands of God.</p>

It cannot then be chosen but that for as many as hold the foundation: and haue all holden sins &amp; errors in hatred: the blessing of repentance for vnknowne sins and errors, is obtained at the hands of God through the gracious mediation of Iesus Christ for such suiters as cry with the Prophet <hi>David; Purge me O Lord from my secret sinnes.</hi>

            <p n="19">19 But we wash a wall of lome; we labor in vaine; all this is nothing; it doth not proue; it cannot iustifie, that which we go about to mainetaine. Infidels and heathen men are not so godlesse, but that they may no doubt, cry God mercie, and desire in generall to haue their sinnes forgiven them. To such as deny the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith there can be no salvation (according to

the ordinary course which God doth vse in saving me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) without a particular repentance of that error. The <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> thinking that vnlesse they were circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised, they could not be saved, overthrew the foundations of faith directly: therefore if any of them did die so perswaded, whether before or after they told of their errour, their end is dreadfull; there is no way with them but one, death and condemnation. For the Apostle speaketh nothing of men departed, but saith generally of all, <hi>If you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.

I hope if this be answered, the cause in question is at an end. Concerning generall repentance therefore, what? a murtherer, a blasphemer, an vncleane person, a Turke, a Jew, any sinner to escape the wrath of God, by a generall repentance; <hi>God forgiue me?</hi> Truely it never came within mine hart that a generall repentance doth serue for all sinnes: it serveth only for the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versights of our sinfull life, and for the faults which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do not marke, or doe not know that they are faults. Our fathers were actually penitent for sins, wherein they knew they displeased God, or else they fal not within the compasse of my first speech. Againe, that otherwise they could not be saved, then holding the foundation of Christian faith, we haue not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but proved. Why is it not then confessed that thousands of our fathers which liued in Popish super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, might yet by the mercy of God be saved? First, if they had directly denied the very fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, without repenting them particularlie of that sin: he which saith there could be no salvation for them according to the ordinary course which God doth vse in saving men, granteth plainly, or at the least closely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth, that an extraordinary priviledge of mercie might deliver their soules from hell; which is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I required. Secondly, if the foundation be denied, it is denied for feare of some heresie, which the church of Rome maintaineth. But how many were there amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst our fathers, who being seduced by the common errour of that Church, never knew the meaning of her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies? So that although all popish heretiques did perish: thousands of them which lived in popish superstitions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21763:16"/>
might bee saved. Thirdly, seeing all that held popish<note place="margin">3</note> heresies, did not hold all the heresies of the Pope: why might not thousands, which were infected with other leven, liue and die vnsowred with this, and so be * saved? Fourthly, if they all held this heresie, many there were<note place="margin">4</note> 
               <note place="margin">For this is the only thing alleaged to proue the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie of their salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The church of Rome ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth workes with Christ, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the foundation, &amp; vnlesse we hold the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As for example, did they holde that wee cannot bee saved with Christ without good works? We our selues do I thinke al say as much, with this construction, salvation being taken as in that sentence, <hi>Corde creditur ad iustitiam, ore fit confessio ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem,</hi> except infants, and men cut off vpon the point of their conversion: of the rest none shall see God, but such as seeke peace and holines, though not a cause of their salvation, yet as a way which they must walke, which will be saved. Did they that hold without works that we are not iustified, take iustification so as it may also imply sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And <hi>S. Iames</hi> doth say as much. For except there be an ambiguitie in the same tearme, <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>S. Iames</hi> do contradict each the other, which can not be. Now there is no ambiguity in the name ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faith, or of workes, being meant by them both in one and the same sense. Finding therefore that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is spoken of by <hi>S. Paul</hi> without implying san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, when he proveth that a man is iustified by faith without workes; finding likewise that iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth some time imply sanctification also with it: I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose nothing to be more sound, then so to interpret <hi>S. Iames,</hi> speaking not in that sense, but in this.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:21763:17"/>21 Wee haue already shewed that there bee two kindes of Christian righteousnes: the one without vs, which we haue by imputation; th'other in vs, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sisteth of faith, hope, and charitie, and other Christian vertues. And <hi>S. Iames</hi> doth proue that <hi>Abraham</hi> had not only the one, because the thing beleeved was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him for righteousnes: but also the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he offered vp his son. God giveth vs both the one iustice and the other: the one, by accepting vs for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in Christ; th'other, by working christian righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes in vs. The proper and most immediate efficient cause in vs of this later, is the spirit of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue received into our hearts. That whereof it consisteth, where of it is really and formally made, are those infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vertues proper and particular vnto Saints, which the spirit in the very moment when first it is given of of God, bringeth with it: the effects whereof are such actions as the Apostle doth call the fruits of works, the operations of the spirit. The difference of the which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations from the root whereof they spring, maketh it needfull to put two kinds likewise of sanctifying righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes; <hi>Habituall,</hi> and <hi>Actuall. Habituall,</hi> that holinesse wherewith our soules are inwardly indued, the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, when first we begin to be the temples of the <hi>Holy Ghost: Actuall,</hi> that holynesse which afterwards beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the parts and actions of our life; the holynes for the which <hi>Enoch, Iob, Zacharie, Elizabeth,</hi> &amp; other Saints are in the Scriptures so highly commended. If here it be demanded which of these we do first receiue; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere that the spirit, the vertues of the spirit, the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall iustice which is ingrafted, the externall iustice of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21763:17"/>
               <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which is imputed: these wee receiue all at one and the same time; whensoever we haue any of these, we haue all; they goe together. Yet sith no man is iustified except he beleeue, and no man beleeueth except he haue faith, and no man except he haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the spirit of adoption, hath faith, for asmuch as they doe necessarily inferre iustification, and iustification doth of necessity presuppose them: we must needs hold that imputed righteousnes, in dignitie being the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, is notwithstanding in order the last of all these: but <hi>actuall righteousnesse,</hi> which is the righteousnes of good workes, succeedeth all, followeth after al, both in order and time. Which being attentiuely marked, sheweth plainely how the faith of true beleevers cannot bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from hope and loue; how faith is a part of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and yet vnto iustification necessarie; howe faith is perfected by good workes, and no worke of ours without faith; finally, how our fathers might hold that we are iustified by faith alone, and yet hold truely, that without works we are not iustified. Did they think that men doe merit rewards in heaven, by the workes they performe on earth? The ancient vse <hi>meriting for obtaining,</hi> and in that sense they of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> haue it in their confession; <hi>We teach that good workes commaunded of God, are necessarily to be done, and by the free kindnes of God they merit their certaine rewards.</hi> Therefore speaking as our fathers did, and we taking their speech in a sound meaning as we may take our fathers, and might for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as their meaning is doubtfull, and charity doth alwaies interprete doubtfull things favourably: what should iuduce vs to thinke that rather the dammage of

               <hi>are able to make thee wise vnto salvation.</hi> It is the demand of nature her selfe, <hi>what shal we do to haue eternal life?</hi> The desire of immortalitie and of the knowledge of that whereby it may be obtained, is so natural vnto all men, that even they who are not perswaded that they shall, do notwithstanding wish that they might know away how to see no end of life. And, because natural meanes are not able still to resist the force of death: there is no people in the earth so savage which hath not devised some supernaturall helpe or other to fly for aide &amp; suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in extremities against the enemies of their lawes. A longing therefore to be saved, without vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the true waie how, hath beene the cause of al the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions in the world. O that the miserable state of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which wander in darknes, and wote not whither they goe, could giue vs vnderstanding harts, worthelie to esteeme the riches of the mercy of God towards vs, before whose eies the doores of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are set wide open: should we offer violence vnto it? it offereth violence vnto vs, and we gather strength to withstand it. But I am besides my purpose when I fall to bewaile the cold affection which we beare towards that whereby we should be saved; my purpose being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21763:20"/>
only to set downe what the ground of salvation is. The doctrine of the gospell proposeth salvation as the end, and doth it not teach the way of attaining therevnto? Yet the damosell possest with a spirit of divinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, spake the truth; <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 16. 17.</note> 
               <hi>These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew vnto vs the way of salvation;</hi>

               <hi>A new and living way which Christ hath prepared for vs, through the vaile that is his flesh;</hi> salvation purchased by the death of Christ. By this foundation the children of God before the written law, were distinguished from the sonnes of men; the reverend Patriarks both possest it living, and spake expresly of it <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> at the houre of their death. It <note n="d" place="margin">Iob. 19.</note> comforted <hi>Iob</hi> in the midst of griefe; it was afterwards the anker hold of all the righteous in Israell, from the writing of the law, to the time of grace. Every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet maketh mention of it. It was famously spoken of about the time, when the comming of Christ to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the promises, which were made long before it, drewe neere, that the sound thereof was heard even amongst the Gentils. When he was come, as many as were his, acknowledged that he was their salvation; he, that long expected hope of Israel; he, that <hi>seed, in whom all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.</hi> So that now he is a name of ruine, a name of death and condemnation, vnto such as dreame of a new Messias, to as many as looke for salvation by any other then by him. <hi>For</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men there is given no other name vnder heaven whereby we must be saved.</hi> Thus much S. Marke doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate by that which hee doth put in the front of his booke, making his entrance with these words; <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Gospell of Iesus Christ the son of God.</hi> His do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21763:21"/>
he tearmeth the Gospell, because it teacheth sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the Gospell of Iesus Christ the sonne of God, because it teacheth salvation by him. This is then the foundation wherevpon the frame of the Gospell is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; that very Iesus whome the Virgin conceived of the holy Ghost, whom <hi>Simeon</hi> imbraced in his arms, whom Pilat condemned, whom the Iewes crucified, whom the Apostles preached, he <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 2. 11.</note> is Christ, the Lord, the only Saviour of the world: <note n="g" place="margin">1, Cor. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Other foundation can no man lay.</hi> Thus I haue briefly opened that principle in Christianity, which we call the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our faith. It followeth now, that I declare vnto you what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to overthrow it. This wil be better opened, if we vnderstand what it is to hold the foundation of faith.</p>
            <p n="24">24 There are which defend that many of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils who never heard the name of Christ, held the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Christianitie, &amp; why? they acknowledged many of them, the providence of God; his infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, strength, power; his goodnesse, and his mercy towards the children of men; that God hath iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in store for the wicked, but for the righteous which ferue him, rewardes, &amp;c. In this which they confessed, that lieth covered which we beleeue; in the rudiments of their knowledge concerning God, the foundation of our faith concerning Christ, lieth secretly wrapt vp, and is vertually contained: therefore they held the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith, though they never had it. Might wee not with as good a colour of reason defend, that every ploughman hath al the sciences wherein Philosophers haue exceld? For no man is ignorant of their first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which doe vertually containe whatsoever by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21763:21"/>
meanes, is or can be knowne. Yea, might wee not with as great reason affirme, that a man may put three mighty oakes wheresoever three akornes may be put? For vertually an akorne is an oake. To avoid such para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, we teach plainely that to hold the foundation, is in expresse tearmes, to acknowledge it.</p>
            <p n="25">25 Now, because the foundation is an affirmatiue proposition: they all overthrowe it who deny it; they directly overthrow it, who deny it directly; and they overthrow it by consequent, or indirectly, which hold any one assertion whatsoever, wherevpon the direct denial thereof, may be necessarily concluded. What is the question betweene the Gentiles and vs, but this, <hi>whether salvation bee by Christ?</hi> What betweene the Iewes and vs, but this, <hi>Whether by this Iesus, whom wee call Christ, yea or no?</hi> This to be the maine point wherevpon Christianity standeth, it is cleere by that one sentence of <hi>Festus</hi> concerning <hi>Paules</hi> accusers, <hi>They brought no crime of such things as I supposed, but had certain questions against him of their superstition, and of one Iesus which was dead, whome Paul affirmed to be aliue.</hi> Where we see that Iesus, dead and raised for the salvation of the world, is by Iewes denied, despised by a Gentile, by a Christian Apostle maintained. The Fathers therefore in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, when they wrote; <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the booke which hee calleth <hi>Apologeticus; Minucius Foelix,</hi> the booke which he intitleth <hi>Octavius; Arnobius,</hi> the seave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bookes against the <hi>Gentiles; Chrysostome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> his Orations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iewes; <hi>Eusebius,</hi> his tenne bookes of <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall demonstration:</hi> they stand in defence of Christianity against them, by whom the foundation thereof was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21763:22"/>
directly denyed. But the writings of the Fathers against <hi>Novatians, Pelagians,</hi> and other heretikes of the like note, refell positions, whereby the foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian faith, was overthrowne by consequent onely. In the former sort of writings, the foundation is proved; in the later, it is alleaged as a proofe, which to men that had beene knowne directly to deny, must needes haue seem'd a very beggerly kind of disputing. All Infidels therefore deny the foundation of faith directly; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, many a Christian man, yea whole Christian Churches haue denied it, and doe deny it at this present day. Christian Churches, the foundation of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? Not directly; for then they cease to be Christian Churches: but by a consequent, in respect whereof we condemne them as erroneous, although for holding the foundation, we doe, and must hold them Christian.</p>
            <p n="26">26 We see what it is to hold the foundation; what directly, and what by consequent, to deny it. The next thing which followeth, is, whether they whome God hath chosen to obtaine the glory of our Lord Iesus Christ, may, once effectually called, and through faith iustified truely, afterwards fall so farre, as directly to deny the foundation, which their hearts haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imbraced with ioy and comfort in the holy Ghost: for such is the faith which indeed doth iustifie. Devilles knowe the same things which wee beleeue, and the mindes of the most vngodly may bee fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the truth: which knowledge in th'one and in the'other is sometimes termed faith, but equivocally, being indeed no such faith as that whereby a Christian man is iustified. It is the spirit of adoption which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21763:22"/>
faith in vs, in them not: the things which wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, are by vs apprehended, not only as true, but also as good, and that to vs: as good, they are not by them apprehended; as true, they are. Wherevpon followeth the third difference; the Christian man the more hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth in faith, the more his ioy, and comfort aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: but they, the more sure they are of the truth, the more they quake and tremble at it. This begetteth an other effect, where the harts of th'one sort haue a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent disposition from the other. <hi>Non ignoro pleros<expan>

So it is in other articles of faith, whereof wicked men thinke, no doubt, many times they are too true: on the the contrary side, to the other, there is no griefe or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment greater, then to feele their perswasion weake in things, whereof when they are perswaded, they reape such comfort and ioy of spirit: such is the faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are iustified; such, I mean, in respect of the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For touching the principall obiect of faith, longer then it holdeth the foundation whereof wee haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it neither iustifieth, nor is, but ceaseth to bee faith, when it ceaseth to beleeue that Iesus Christ is the onlie Saviour of the world. The cause of life spirituall in vs is Christ, not carnally or corporally inhabiting, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21763:23"/>
dwelling in the soule of man, as a thing which (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the minde apprehendeth it) is said to inhabite or possesse the minde. The minde conceiveth Christ by hearing the doctrin of Christianitie, as the light of nature doth the minde to apprehend those truths which are mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie rationall, so that saving truth which is farre aboue the reach of humane reason, cannot otherwise then by the spirit of the Almightie be conceived. All these are implyed wheresoever anie of them is mentioned as the cause of the spirituall life. Wherefore if we haue read that <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 8. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The spirit is our life;</hi> or, <note n="b" place="margin">Philip. 2. 15.</note>

               <hi>He that hath the sonne hath life,</hi> saith <hi>S.

But the life of them which haue the sonne of God <note n="g" place="margin">1.

               <note place="margin">Perpetuity of faith.</note> the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him: so the iustified man <note n="a" place="margin">Rom 6. 10.</note> being alied to God in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord, doth as necessarily from that time forward alwaies liue, as Christ <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 14 19.</note> by whom he hath life, liveth alwaies. I might, if I had not other where largely done it already, shew by many and sundry manifest and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21763:23"/>
cleere proofes, how the motions and operations of life, are sometimes so indiscernable and so secret, that they seeme stone dead, who notwithstanding are still aliue vnto God in Christ. For as long as that abideth in in vs, which animateth, quickneth, and giveth life, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g we liue, and we knowe that the cause of our faith abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in vs for ever. If Christ the fountaine of life, may flit, and leaue the habitation where once hee dwelleth: what shall become of his promise, <hi>I am with you to the worlds end?</hi> If the seed of God which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth Christ, may be first conceived and then cast out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how doth S.

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 16.</note> the man which is once iust by faith, shall liue by faith, and liue for ever: it followeth, that he which once doth beleeue the foundation, must needes beleeue the foundation for ever. If hee beleeue it for ever, how can he ever directly deny it? Faith holdeth the direct affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; the direct negation, so long as faith continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> is excluded. But you will say, that as hee that is to day holy, may to morrow forsake his holinesse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impure; as a friend may change his mind, and bee made an enimie; as hope may wither: so faith may die in the heart of man, the spirit may be quenched, grace may be extinguished, they which beleeue may be quite<note place="margin">Sol.</note> turned away from the truth. The cause is cleere, long experience hath made this manifest: it needs no proof. I grant we are apt, prone, and ready to forsake God: but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21763:24"/>
is God ready to forsake vs? Our minds are changeable: is his so likewise? Whom God hath iustified, hath not Christ assured that it is <hi>his Fathers will to giue them a kingdome?</hi> Notwithstanding it shall not bee otherwise given them, then if they continue <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 1. 23</note> grounded and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the faith, and bee not moved away from the<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 15.</note> hope of the Gospell; <hi>if they abide in loue and holinesse.</hi> Our Saviour therefore, when he spake of the sheepe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, and truly gathered into his fold; <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh 10.</note> 
               <hi>I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hands;</hi> in promising to saue them, he promised, no doubt, to preserue them in that without which there can be no salvation as also from that whereby it is irrecoverably lost. Every errour in things appertaining vnto God, is repugnant vnto faith every fearefull cogitation vnto hope; vnto loue, every stragling inordinate desire; vnto holines, every blemish, wherewith either the inward thoughts of our minds, or the outward actions of our liues are stained. But heresy, such as that of <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> &amp; others, against whom the Apostles were forced to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selus both by word and also by writing; that repining discouragement of heart, which tempteth God, whereof we haue Israell in the desert for a patterne: coldnesse; such as that in the Angels of Ephesus; fowle sins, knowne to bee expresly against the first, or second Table of the Law, such as <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Manasses, David, Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> committed; these are each in their kind so opposit to the former vertues, that they leaue no place for salvation without an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all repentance. But infidelitie, extreame despaire, hatred of God &amp; all goodnesse, obduration in sin, cannot sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21763:24"/>
where there is but the least sparke of faith, hope, loue, &amp; sanctity: even as cold in the lowest degree, cannot be where heate in the highest degree is found. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I conclude, that, although in the first kinde, no man liveth which sinneth not; and, in the second, as perfect as any do liue; may sin: yet sith the Man which is borne of God, hath a promise that in him <note n="a" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3 9.</note> 
               <hi>the seede of God shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide,</hi> which seed is a sure preservatiue against the sinnes that are of the third sure: greater and clearer assuraunce we cannot haue of any thing, then of this, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such sins God shal preserue the righteous as the apple of his eie for ever. Directly to denie the foundation of faith is plaine infidelitie; where faith is entred, there infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is for ever excluded; therefore by him which hath once sincerely beleeved in Christ, the foundation of Christian faith can never be directly denied. Did not <hi>Peter?</hi> did not <hi>Marcellinus?</hi> did not others both directlie deny Christ after that they had beleeved, and againe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue after they had denied? No doubt, as they confesse in words, whose condemnation is neverthelesse their not beleeving (for example we haue <hi>Iudas:</hi>) so likewise they may beleeue in heart, whose condemnation, with out repentance, is their not confessing. Although there fore <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest, for whose faith Christ hath prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it might not faile, did not by deniall sin the sin of infidelitie, which is an inward abnegation of Christ (but if they had done this, their faith had cleerely fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:) yet because they sinned notoriously &amp; grievously committing that which they knew to bee expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the law, which saith, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serue;</hi> necessarie it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21763:25"/>
was that he which purposed to saue their souls, should, as he did, touch their hearts with true vnfeined repeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that his mercy might restore them againe to life, whom sin had made the children of death &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Touching this point therefore, I hope I may safely set downe, that if the iustified erre, as he may, and never come to vnderstand his errour, God doth saue him through generall repentance; but if he fall into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he calleth him at one time or other by actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: but from infidelitie, which is an inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect denial of the foundation, he preserveth him by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence for ever. Whereby wee may easilie know what to thinke of those <hi>Galatians,</hi> whose heartes were so possest with the loue of the truth, that if it had bin possible, they would haue pluckt out their eies to bestow vpon their teachers.

Yet they which had their fansies, even when they had them were not the worst men in the world.

They acknowledged Christ to be their only, and perfect Saviour, but saw not how repugnant their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the necessitie of Mosaicall ceremonies was to their faith in Iesus Christ. Herevnto a reply is made, that if they had not directly denied the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they might haue beene saved; but saved they could not bee, therefore their opinion was not onely by consequent, but directly a deniall of the foundation. When the que<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stion was about the possibilitie of their salvation, their denying of the foundation was brought to proue that they could not be saved; now that the question is about their deniall of the foundation, the impossibilitie of their salvation, is alleaged to proue, they denied the foundation. Is there nothing which excludeth men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> salvation, but only the foundation of faith denied?

Our case were very hard, if this argument so vniversally meant, as it is proposed, were sound and good. We our selues doe not teach Christ alone, excluding our owne faith, vnto iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Christ alone, excluding our own works, vnto sanctification; Christ alone, excluding the one or the other vnnecessarie vnto salvation. It is a chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dish cavill wherewith in the matter of iustification our adversaries do so greatly please themselues, exclaiming that we tread all Christian vertues vnder our feet, and require nothing in Christians but faith, because wee teach that faith alone iustifieth: whereas by this speech we never meant to exclude either hope, or charitie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being alwaies ioined as inseparable mates with faith in the man that is iustified; or workes from being added as necessarie duties required at the hands of every iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man: but to shew that faith is the only hand, which putteth on Christ vnto iustification; and Christ, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly garment, which being so put on, covereth the shame of our defiled natures, hideth the imperfections of our workes, preserveth vs blameles in the sight of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom otherwise, the weaknesse of our faith were cause sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make vs culpable, yea to shut vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kingdome of heaven, where nothing that is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, can enter. That our dealing with them bee not as childish as theirs with vs, when wee heare of salvation by Christ alone, considering that [<hi>alone</hi>] as an exclusiue particle, we are to note what it doth exclude, &amp; where. If I say, <hi>such a iudge only, ought to determine such a case,</hi> all

things incident to the determination thereof, besides the person of the Iudge, as lawes, dispositions, eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c. are not hereby excluded; persons are not excluded from witnessing herein, or assisting, but onely from determining and giving sentence. How then is our salvation wrought by Christ alone? It is not our meaning that nothing is requisite to mans salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but Christ to saue, and he to be saved quietly without anie more adooe. As we haue received, so we teach, that besides the bare and naked worke, wherein Christ without anie other associate finished all the partes of our redemption, &amp; purchased salvation himselfe alone, for conveiance of this eminent blessing vnto vs, manie things are of necessitie required: as to bee knowne and chosen of God before the foundation of the world; in the world to called, iustified, sanctified; after wee haue left the world, to be receiued vnto glorie; Christ in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie of these hath somwhat which he worketh alone.

            <p n="32">32 Then what is the fault of the Church of Rome? Not that shee requireth workes at their handes which will be saved: but that shee attributeth vnto workes a power of satisfying God for sin; yea a vertue to merite both grace here, and in heaven glorie. That this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the foundation of faith, I graunt willingly; that it is a direct denying thereof, I vtterlie deny: what it is to hold, and what directly to deny the foundation of faith, I haue already opened. Apply it particularly to this cause, and there needs no more adooe. The thing which is handled, if the forme vnder which it is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, be added therevnto, it sheweth the foundation of any doctrine whatsoever. Christ is the matter whereof the doctrine of the Gospell treateth; and it treateth of Christ, as of a Saviour. Salvation therefore by Christ is the foundation of Christianitie: as for works, they are a thing subordinate, no otherwise then because our san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification cannot be accomplished without them; the doctrine concerning them, is a thing builded vpon the foundation; therefore the doctrine which addeth vnto

Againe denying the sonne of God to haue beene borne in the flesh, how canst thou beleeue him to haue suffred? beleeving not his passion, what remaineth but that thou deny his resurrection? For we beleeue him not raised, except wee first beleeue him dead: neither can the reason of his rising from the dead stand without the faith of his death going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before. The deniall of his death and passion inferreth the deniall of his rising from the depth. Wherevpon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that thou also denie his ascension into heaven. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle affirmeth that he which ascended, did first descend, so that as much as lyeth in thee, our Lord Iesus Christ hath neither risen from the depth, nor is ascended into heaven, nor sitteth at the right hand God the father, neither shall he come at the day of finall account which is looked for, nor shall iudge the quicke and dead.

Yet because of that weakenes, which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher noteth in mens capacities, when he saith, that the common sort cannot see things which followe in reason, when they follow as it were a farre of by manie deductions; therefore the repugnancie of such heresie and the foundation, is not so quickly or so easily found, but that an hereticke of this, sooner then of the former kinde, may directly graunt and consequently neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, denie the foundation of faith.</p>

the faculties thereof, their wils, and all the abilitie of their wils from God. And is not the Church of Rome still an adversarie vnto Christs merits, because of her acknowledging that we haue received the power of meriting by the blood of Christ? S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               </note> downe the oddes betweene vs and he Church of Rome in the matter of works thus; <hi>Like as wee graunt them that no good worke of man is rewardable in heaven of his owne nature, but through the meere goodnesse of God, that list to set so high a price vpon so poore a thing; and that this price God setteth through Christs passion, and for that also they bee his owne workes with vs; for good workes to God-ward worketh no man, without God worke in him; and as we grant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also, that no man may be proud of his works, for his imperfect working, and for that in all that man may doe, he can doe God no good, but is a servant improfitable &amp; doth but his bare dutie; as we, I say, graunt vnto them these things: so this one thing, or twaine, do they grant vs againe, that men are bound to worke good workes, if they haue time and power, and that who so worketh in true faith mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st, shall be most rewarded; but then set they thereto, that all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards shall be given him for his faith alone, &amp; nothing for his workes at all, because his faith is the thing, they say, that forceth him to work well.</hi> I see by this of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Thomas More,</hi> how easie it is for men of the greatest capacitie, to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take things written or spoken as well on the one side as on the other. Their doctrine, as hee thought, maketh the worke of man rewardable in the world to come, through the goodnesse of God, whom it pleaseth to set so high a price vpon so poore a thing; and ours, that a man doth receiue that eternall and high reward, not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21763:35"/>
for his workes, but for his faiths sake, by which he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: whereas in truth our doctrine is no other then that we haue learned at the feet of Christ, namely, that God doth iustifie the beleeving man, yet not for the worthinesse of his beleife, but for the worthines of him which is beleeved; God rewardeth abundantly every one which worketh, yet not for any meritorious dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is, or can be in the worke, but through his meere mercy, by whose commandement hee worketh. Contrariwise their doctrine is, that as pure water of it selfe hath no savour, but if it passe throug a sweet pipe, it taketh a pleasant smell of the pipe through which it passeth: so, although before grace received, our works do neither satisfie, nor merit; yet after, they do both the one and the other. Every vertuous action hath then power in such to satisfie, that if we our selues commit no mortall sinne, no hainous crime wherevpon to spend this treasure of satisfaction in our owne behalfe,<note place="margin">Workes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> it turneth to the benefit of other mens release, on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shall please the steward of the house of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it, so that we may satisfie for ourselues &amp; others, but merit only for our selues. In meriting, our actions doe worke with two hands; with one they get their morning stipend, the increase of grace; with the other, their evening hire, the everlasting crowne of glorie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they teach that our good workes doe not these things, as they come from vs, but as they come from grace in vs: which grace in vs is another thing in their divinitie, then is the meere goodnesse of Gods mercy towards vs in Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p n="34">34 I fit were not a strong deluding spirit which

Is this that salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by grace, whereof so plentifull mention is made in the scriptures of God? Was this their meaning which first taught the worlde to looke for salvation onely by Christ? By grace, the Apostle saith, and by grace in such sort as a gift, a thing that commeth not of our selues, not of our workes, lest anie man should boast, &amp; say, <hi>I haue wrought out my own salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> By grace they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse; but by grace in such sort, that as many as weare the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ademe of blisse, they wear nothing but what they haue wonne. The Apostle, as if he had foreseene, how the church of Rome would abuse the world in time by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous termes, to declare in what sense the name of grace must be taken when we make it the cause of our salvation, saith, <hi>He saved vs according to his mercie:</hi> which mercie although it exclude not the washing of our new birth, the renuing of our harts by the holy Ghost, the meanes, the vertues, the duties which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of their hands which shall be saved, yet is it so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant vnto merits, that to say wee are saved for the worthines of anie thing which is ours, is to denie wee are saved by grace. Grace bestoweth freely: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iustlie requireth the glorie of that which is besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. We denie the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ; we abuse, disanull, and annihilate the benefit of his bitter passion: if we rest in these proud imaginations that life is deservedly ours, that we merit it, and that we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it.</p>
            <p n="35">35 How be it considering how many vertuous &amp; iust

men, how many Saints, how many Martyres, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the ancient fathers of the church, haue had their sundry perilous opinions, and amongst sundrie of their opinions, this, that they hoped to make good some part of amends for their sins, by the voluntarie punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they laid vpon themselues, because by a consequent it may follow herevpon, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious vnto Christ: shall we therefore make such dead lie epitaphes and set them vpon their graues; <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the foundation of faith directly; they are damned; there is no salvation for them?

Surely in this case, I haue no respect of any person aliue or dead. Giue me a man of what state or condition soever, yea a <hi>Cardinall,</hi> or a <hi>Pope</hi> whom in the extreame point of his life affliction hath made to know himselfe, whose hart God hath touched with true sorrow for all his sinnes, and filled with loue towards the Gospell of Christ, whose eies are opened to see the truth, and his mouth to renounce all heresie and error any wise opposite therevnto (this one opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of merits excepted) he thinketh God will require at his hands, and because he wanteth, therefore trembleth and is discouraged; It may be, I am forgetfull, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull, not furnished with things newe and olde as a wise learned scribe should bee, nor able to alleage that, wherevnto, if it were alleaged, hee doth beare a minde most willing to yeeld, and so to be recalled as well from this, as from other errors. And shall I thinke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

of this only error, that such a man toucheth not so much as the hemme of Christs garment? If he doe, wherefore shoulde not I haue hope that vertue may proceede from Christ to saue him? Because his errour doth by consequent overthrow his faith? Shall I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cast him off as one that hath vtterly cast of Christ? one that holdeth not so much as by a slender threed? No, I wil not be afraid to saie vnto a <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Cardinall</hi> in this plight, be of good comfort, we haue to doe with a mercifull God; rather to make the best of a little which we hold well, and not with a captious sophister, which gathereth the worst out of everie thing, wherein wee erre.

that ranke, to be afterwards touched with anie such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse, let that be graunted. The Apostle saith, <hi>If I or an Angell from heaven preach vnto, &amp;c.</hi> Let it bee as likely that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> or an Angel from heaven should preach heresie, as that a Pope or a Cardinall should be brought so farre forth to acknowledge the truth: yet if a Pope or a Cardinall should, what finde wee in their persons, why they might not bee saved? It is not the persons, you will saie, but the errour, wherein I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to die, which excludeth them from the hope of mercie; the opinion of merits doth take awaie all possibitie of salvation from them. What, if they hold it onlie as an error? although they hold the truth truelie and sincerelie in all other partes of Christian faith? although they haue in some measure all the vertues and graces of the spirite, all other tokens of Gods elect children in them? although they be farre from having anie prowde presumptuous opinion, that they shall be saved by the worthynesse of their deedes? although the onelie thing which troubleth and mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth them, bee but a little too much deiection, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too great a feare, rising from an erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, that God will require a worthynesse in them, which they are grieved to finde wanting in themselues? although they bee not obstinate in this perswasion? although they be willing and would be glad to forsake it, if any one reason were brought sufficient to disproue it? although the only let why they doe not forsake it ere they die, be the ignorance of the meanes, by which it might be disproued? although the cause why the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in this point is not removed, bee the want of

knowledge in such as should be able, and are not, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue it? Let me die, if ever it be proved, that simply an error doth exclude a <hi>Pope</hi> or a <hi>Cardinall</hi> in such a case vtterly from hope of life. Surely, I must confesse vnto you, if it be an errour, that God may bee mercifull to saue men, even when they erre: my greatest comfort is my errour; were it not for the loue I beare vnto this errour, I would never wish to speake nor to liue.</p>
            <p n="36">36 Wherefore, to resume that mother sentence, whereof I little thought that so much trouble would haue growne; <hi>I doubt not but that God was mercifull to saue thousands of our fathers living in Popish superstitions, in as much as they sinned ignorantly:</hi> alas what bloodie matter is there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in this sentence, that it should be an occasion of so many hard censures?

We pittie the most, and doubt not, but God hath most compassion over them that sinne for want of vnderstanding. As much is confessed by sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, almost in the selfe same words which I haue vsed. It is but only my evill hap, that the same sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which savor veritie in other mens books, should seeme to bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster heresie when they are once by me recited. If I bee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21763:38"/>
deceived in this point, not they, but the blessed Apostle hath deceived me. What I said of others, the same hee said of himselfe, <hi>I obtaine mercy for I did it ignorantly.</hi> Conster his words, and you cannot misconster mine. I speake no otherwise. I meant no otherwise then hee did.</p>
            <p n="37">37 Thus haue I brought the question concerning our Fathers, at the length vnto an end. Of whose estate vpon so fit an occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as was offred me, handling the weightie causes of separation betweene the Church of Rome and vs, and the weake motiues which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly brought to retaine men in that society; amongst which motiues, the examples of our Fathers deceased is one, although I saw it convenient to vtter that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which I did to the ende, that all men might there by vnderstand, how vntruely we are said to condemne as many as haue beene before vs otherwise perswaded then we our selues are; yet more then that one sentence I did not thinke it expedient to vtter, iudging it a great deale meeter for vs to haue regard to our owne estate, then to sift over curiously, what is become of other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And fearing least that such questions as these, if voluntarily they should bee to farre waded in, might seeme worthie of that rebuke, which our Saviour thought needfull in a case not vnlike; <hi>What is this vnto thee?</hi> when I was forced much beside mine expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to render a reason of my speech, I could not but yeeld at the call of others, and proceed so farre as dutie bound mee, for the fuller satisfying of mindes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue walked as with reverence, so with feare: with reverence, in regard of our Fathers, which lived in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21763:39"/>
former times; not without feare, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering them that are aliue.</p>
            <p n="38">38 I am not ignorant, how readie men are to feed and sooth vp themselues in evill. Shall I, will the man say that loveth the present world more then hee loveth Christ, shall I incurre the high displeasure of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiest vpon earth? shall I hazard my goods? endanger my estate? put my selfe in ieopardie, rather then yeeld to that which so many of my fathers embraced, and yet found favour in the sight of God? <hi>Curse Meroz,</hi> saith<note place="margin">Iudg. 5. 23.</note> the Lord, <hi>curse her inhabitants, because they helped not the Lord, they help'd him not against the mightie.</hi> If I should not only not helpe the Lord against the mightie, but helpe to strengthen them that are mightie, against the Lord: worthily might I fall vnder the burden of that curse, worthie I were to beare my owne iudgement. But if the doctrine which I teach, be a flower gathered in the garden of the Lord; a part of the saving truth of the Gospell; from whence notwithstanding poisoned creatures doe sucke venime: I can but wish it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and content my selfe with the lotte that hath befallen mee, the rather because it hath not befallen me alone. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> teached a truth, and a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truth, when he taught, that the greater our misery is, in respect of our iniquities, the readier is the mercy of God for our release. If wee seeke vnto him, the more we haue sinned, the more praise, and glorie, and honor vnto him that pardoneth our sinne. But marke what lewd collections were made herevpon by some. <hi>Whie then am I condemned for a sinner?</hi> and the Apostle (as we are blamed, and as some affirme that we say; <hi>Whie doe we</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:21763:39"/>
               <hi>not evill that good may come of it?</hi>) hee was accused to teach that which ill disposed men did gather by his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, though it were cleane not only besides, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his meaning. The Apostle addeth, <hi>Their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> (which thus doe) <hi>is iust.</hi> I am not hastie to apply sentences of condemnation. I wish from mine heart their conversion, whosoever are thus perversely affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. For I must needs say, their case is fearefull, their estate dangerous, which harden themselues, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the mercy of God towardes others. It is true that God is mercifull; but lette vs beware of presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sinnes: God delivered <hi>Ionah</hi> from the bottome of the sea; will you therefore cast your selues head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the toppes of rockes, and say in your hearts, God shall deliver vs? Hee pittieth the blind that would gladly see; but will hee pittie them that may see, and hardeneth himselfe in blindnesse? No. Christ hath spoken too much vnto you, to claime the priviledge of your fathers.</p>
            <p n="39">39 As for vs that haue handled this cause concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the condition of our Fathers, whether it bee this thing, or any other, which wee bring vnto you, the counsell is good which the wise man giveth, <hi>Stand thou fast in thy sure vnderstanding, in the way and knowledge of the Lord, and haue but one manner of word, and follow the word of peace and righteousnesse.</hi> As a loose tooth is a griefe to him that eateth: so doth a wavering and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable word in speech, that tendeth to instruction, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Shall a wise man speake words of the winde,</hi> saith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> light, vnconstant, vnstable words? Surely the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest may speake words of the winde, such is the vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21763:40"/>
constitution of our nature, that wee doe neither so perfectly vnderstand the way and knowledge of the Lord, nor so stedfastly imbrace it, when it is vnderstood nor so graciously vtter it when it is imbraced; nor so peaceably maintaine it, when it is vttered; but that the best of vs are overtaken sometime through blindnesse, sometime through hastinesse, sometime through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, somtime through other passions of the mind, wherevnto (God doth know) we are too subiect. Wee must therefore be contented, both to pardon others, and to craue that others must pardon vs for such things. Let no man that speaketh as a man, thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, whiles he liveth, alwaies freed from scapes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versights in his speech. The things themselues which I haue spoken vnto you are sound, howsoever they haue seemed otherwise vnto some: at whose hands I haue in that respect receiued iniurie. I willingly forget it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed considering the benefitte which I haue reaped by this necessarie speech of truth, I rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to that of the Apostle, <hi>They haue not iniured me at all.</hi> I haue cause to wish them as many blessings in the kingdome of heaven, as they haue forced mee to vtter words and syllables in this cause; wherein I could not be more sparing of speech then I haue beene. <hi>It becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no man,</hi> saith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ierome, to bee patient in the crime of heresie.</hi> Patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as I take it, we should be alwaies, though the crime of heresie were intended; but silent in a thing of so great consequence I could not, beloued I durst not be: especially the loue that I beare to the truth of Christ Iesus, being hereby somwhat called in question. Whereof I beseech them in the meeknesse of Christ,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21763:40"/>
that haue been the first originall cause, to consider that a watchman may crie (<hi>an enimie</hi>) when indeed a friend commeth. In which cause as I deeme such a watchman more worthie to be loved for this cause, then misliked for his errour: so I haue iudged it my own part in this, as much as in me lieth, to take away all suspicion of any vnfriendly intent or meaning against the truth, from which, God doth knowe, my heart is free.</p>
            <p n="40">40 Now to you, beloued, which haue heard these things, I will vse no other words of admonition, then those which are offered me by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iames, My brethren haue not the faith of our glorious Lord Iesus in respect of persons.</hi> Yee are not now to learne, that as of it selfe it is not hurtfull, so neither should it be to any scandalous and offensiue in doubtfull cases, to heare the different iudgements of men. Bee it that <hi>Cephas</hi> hath one inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and <hi>Apollos</hi> hath another; that <hi>Paule</hi> is of this mind, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> of that; if this offend you, the fault is yours. Carry peaceable minds, and you may haue comfort by this varietie. Now the God of peace giue you peaceable minds, and turne it to your everlasting comfort.</p>
