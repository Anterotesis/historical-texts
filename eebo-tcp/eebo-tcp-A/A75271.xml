            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

only I have given thee a taſte of, untill the others come forth, which will ſpeedily be effected. And note this, that ſcarce one of the ancient Philoſophers ever writ fully of this noble Science, but whatſoever one leaves out, may be found in another (if you read many of the beſt Authours.) I have been a Student in this Art many years, and being ſatisfied of the truth thereof, (having ſtudied many of the beſt Authours), thought fit for the good and benefit of the faithfull Students of this Art, to cauſe theſe to be publiſhed, being by ſome of my beſt friends thereunto very much urged; and becauſe the Students of this Art ſhould not be deceived by falſe Philoſophers, and worke as they do upon falſe matters; as Salts, Alomes, Vitriols, Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Minerals, and the like: let them conſider the words of <hi>Geo: Ripley,</hi> an Engliſh Monke, who ſaith: yet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this worke, according to all the ancient Philoſophers, is one only thing, containing in it ſelfe all neceſſaries to the accompliſhing of its own perfection.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Henricus Cornelius Agrippa</hi> in the ſecond Book of his Occult Philoſophy, in the <hi>4.</hi> Chap. ſaith, there is one thing by God created, the ſubject of all wonderfulneſſe, which is in earth, and in heaven; it is actually, animall, vegetable, and minerall, found every where, known by few, by none expreſſed in his proper name, but covered in numbers, figures, and rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles; without which neither Alchymy, nor naturall Magick, can attaine their perfect end.</p>
            <p>And in the Roſary of the Philoſophers, it is written: but I adviſe that no man intrude himſelf into this Science to ſearch, except he know the beginning of true nature, and her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which being known, he needeth not many things, but one thing; nor doth it require great charges, becauſe the Stone is one, the Medicine one, the Veſſell one, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one, and the diſpoſition one, &amp;c.

            <p>I had a Library of Books of the Workes of Men of many Nations, but I in this buſineſſe did eſteeme neither the Caldeans, neither the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, (though a diligent people) nor the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Aſſyrians, but thoſe of the Eaſt, which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite the Indies, and the Saracens did my worke, and ſo well, that they have honoured our We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne parts.</p>
            <p>The preſent time makes mee to know a ſound and true judgement: becauſe thou ſhouldſt give credit or beliefe to it, doe not conceive that I have lied in any point. That which I look after, is not to bury in oblivion the great worth that was in him my Maſter: but I will not give ſuch an Empire to any man but to him that is Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Now to unriddle this myſtery and to propoſe
<pb facs="tcp:117385:6"/>
truthes in ciphers, though they are obſcure, yet by them you may learne, and ſhall find they are no vaine things; and if thou commeſt to underſtand this great Myſtery, have it not in thy ordinary converſation, but leave it in the ſame cipher of this impreſſion, if thou underſtandeſt how to explaine it.</p>
            <p>This Matter by wiſe men is called by divers names: and this matter which to the unwiſe ſeemes to bee ſomething, to them is nothing, and its nature being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually moiſt and dry that it will not give one without another; which is a ſingular thing to have two ſuch different natures meet together in one. The drie is there in a ſupreame degree, the moiſt likewiſe calls for a ſupream Authority: the hot and cold fight there together, and are contayned there likewiſe in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame degree; and from that equality, comes the name of each of theſe ſeverally according to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and though the moiſt be joyned with the dry, yet each of them retaines its owne name.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Hermes</hi> tells us that it is Heaven and Earth, but others call it Man and Wife, and out of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage they make other Riddles, which ſerve for a light to the infirme Globe, and from thence are called by ſome, Water or Earth, others the cold which is inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in heat, ſo much the wiſe may underſtand.</p>
            <p>The ancient Chaos, according to my judgement, was knit together by the fowre Elements: This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is the like, when the diviſion comes to bee made, the Heaven and the Earth comes to bee a fift Eſſence of all, for this matter is of that kinde, that it compoſeth all things. In this matter are found united the four Elements in equall parts, ſo that if one walk
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117385:7"/>
or move, the others doe the like, for by one the others are conducted, ſo much are they equall in their duties one to another, and where can you hope to find a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing amongſt all Animals, then that which is ſo much approved by all wiſe men?</p>
            <p>Take the Learned Philoſophers Mercury, and let it bee purged from its malignancy and foule quality, for it cannot be too cleane; and ſee that the weight be equall with twelve ounces of the ſayd compoſition, and then put it into a glaſſe bottle, for no mettall elſe is fit for it. And the forme of the glaſſe muſt be of the forme of the Sphere, with a long neck, and no thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then can bee graſped with a large hand, and the length of the necke not above a ſpan, and no wider then the Aegyptian ſeale may cover its mouth. This you muſt put into an earthen pot, ſurrounded about with hot aſhes, and bee ſure with a carefull hand to ſtop up the bottle. And then you muſt have an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Furnace made of Clay, ſo broad and round as that you may fadome at the thickeſt place. You muſt not put the pot in the bottome of the Furnace, but hang it or ſet it in the middle, upon two irons, which muſt lie Diameter wiſe, or acroſſe, and the earthen pot muſt ſtand upon the very centre and croſſe of the two irons, that the fire may come alike to it in all parts, and then with coales make a ſoft fire, but let not your patience bee troubled to keepe it alwayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. The fire muſt not come within a foot of the pot, and the ſurnace luted up cloſe about the pot, that ſo the ſoft fire may keepe it alwayes working, and bee not troubled to keepe the fire ſtill alike, for if it bee the ſame at laſt as at firſt, thou haſt done the worke of an able man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:117385:7"/>
Two changes the Moone muſt paſſe by thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which maketh a month, or the Sun that degree which is called Sextile, without raine, for the worke requires drought: and then you ſhall ſee a paterne of the worke, of which you muſt bee very carefull for unmarrying of it from his firſt matter which is all one. That which time works helped by the Sun and other influences, when taking leave of the Earth, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawne out the moiſtnes that runnes in its veins, it is ſo pleaſed with it, that it converts into ſulphur that part which was moyſt before; ſo that all is ſeene as mother Nature placed it.</p>
            <p>This is the part of the Earth, Sulphur, Woman, hot and dry; for when it makes its firſt change or trucke, that part is wanting which encompaſſed the humidity; as <hi>Penelope</hi> made warre in the abſence of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> in Italy, ſo this Widow ſo pale and wan, hopes for the returne of her baniſhed Husband. By equall weights, as firſt with Art mixt with Mercury, very pure, with this mixture you may worke ſecurely in a glaſſe made by the hands of a good Workman, for the firſt and the laſt muſt be one or like; but if poſſibly thou canſt, the firſt venter is the trueſt.</p>
            <p>Doe the following Worke in ſuch maner, that you keepe the ſame fire that you did before, which will be ſufficient, and be ſure your fire gives no flame, and be ſure alſo to watch it nights and dayes: and if you take that paine, you ſhall bee ſure to finde an excellent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Thou ſhalt ſee the worke in its blackneſſe, and that being changed, as it was firſt borne, which is not yet the thing that mother Nature gave in her firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but ſhall turne to bee ſo liquid and pure that it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117385:8"/>
ſhall be like to Inke, ſo diſtinct ſhall bee the forme of this creature from its firſt being.</p>
            <p>Haſt thou not ſeen the Priſon which the Silkworm makes for it ſelfe, where it dies? and out of that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe dead in the Net it ſelfe made, in which no corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption can come, but riſeth againe in a forme diſtinct from its firſt being, then is brought forth and paints it ſelfe, with wings in a more ugly ſhape: So our work begins to live with a new ſpirit, and new ſubſtance, from whence muſt bee continued the perſeverance of the body, that ſo bloud may bee gotten in it. Doe not you then think of making a greater fire, for by that meanes the bloud and body will bee deſtroyed. Then ſhall you ſee the moſt excellent point of this Divine worke: open the bottle and it will ſeeme to bee rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for there will come from it a very ſtinking ſmell. In this degree is certainly the greateſt labour of this work: for if it bee continued with the ſame heat, it wil certainly come to the higheſt degree of perfection. After this colour is paſt, you ſhall ſee many more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in their likeneſſe and appearance: the Argos, and the Iris in their ſplendor, that the following of the liquid humour will cauſe to bee of divers colours, untill it comes at laſt to a certaine whiteneſſe, then augment a little the heat.</p>
            <p>Friend, bee not weary of your worke, and let it not trouble your patience, for this is the firſt point of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your inheritance. When the Stone is come to the whiteneſſe, it is then fixt, and can never be diſunited, though it ſhould burne 100. yeares, for the union is perfect. Keepe, as I have told you, the fire in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it may come to ſuch a whiteneſſe, as to bee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117385:8"/>
like the pureſt ſnow, which is called the ſilver Elixir. But in regard that Gold is more pretious in eſteeme, let it alone in the bottle with the ſame fire, untill the Stone is come from its white into a Citron colour: then increaſe the fire another degree, and thou ſhalt attaine to a pure red. All being rayſed up will ſhew your worke to be ſecure: the body of this being taken up, will be hard and light, and in it you may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the body of <hi>Diaphano,</hi> and the colour of a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie, as in my owne hands my ſelfe hath ſeene it; for which the great God is by me prayſed. Then put this into an earthen veſſell, covered with a cover of the ſame, like a diſh, and this ſo well joined or luted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of the bigneſſe to hold three <hi>begadas,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bigneſſe of the Stone, and put it on a hot fire of flaming wood there to boile. Heere the Stone will calcine in 10. dayes of the Sun, or Sundayes, &amp;c. and being taken out of that pot, it will be an impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and Divine powder. The firſt ſubſtance which doth good to all, from whence it hath no quality in his Quinteſſence, but is applied to all, and hath power to do all, and very being of the thing that is applied to. <hi>Ente,</hi> from the beginning of Naturall cauſes: it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gold, nor Silver, nor other Minerall, nor ſubject to the forme of any Vegetable, but hath a diſpoſition to doe good to all. If it be applied to Gold, from it, it takes firmneſſe, as to convert other things into that Mettall. For if to man, by famous workes, it gives him health, what can bee eſteemed more pretious? Under this impalpable Gold, it happens that there is found a bright Earth, but very blacke and gliſtering, which is not the beſt however, for that which is very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117385:9"/>
red, is fixt and ſtable, though it be mixt with all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and ſo makes no ingreſſion, but his vertues are very admirable. But with equall weight thou muſt unite it with its firſt principall matter, very pure, and joyne or mixe them together very carefully, if you would have it be brought to live: and then, as I told you before, let it come to the moderate heat as at the firſt, and in the like glaſſe as I preſcribed before, very cloſe ſhut: and as thou didſt with the fire at the firſt, ſo muſt thou doe it now, and in very ſhort time thou ſhalt ſee it become blacke, and of the other colours ſpoken of before, untill it comes to bee red, and will preſently turne into a ſtone. This have I ſeene done in a ſhort time: and hee that knowes it not, let him know that he walks blindfold.</p>
            <p>I have told you the work in plaine words, and how I did it, and ſaw it wrought, ſo I did it, and had the reward: and it is no fallacy, ſeeing that I am a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to it, for which I prayſe and bleſſe God, which gave me ſufficient of knowledge, ſcience, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſtate, which let me never forget.</p>
            <p>If thou wouldſt have a diviſion of this into 100. parts, and ſo <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> it muſt bee done before it hath firmentation or hardneſſe, and then your worke will be certaine. Take an earthen veſſell covered, and in it put your quickſilver, and when it begins to runne over, drop in your Elixir, otherwiſe you cannot keep it for running over. Of Gold one part being purged by Aquafortis with foure of quickſilver waſht, and foure of what is ſpoken of before, joyned with great Art, with one of your Elixir, and put it apart in a crooked glaſſe or retort, and let it feele a fire of coals
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117385:9"/>
ten dayes together, untill they be all mixed together. And if you will make a further progreſſion, put into an earthen pot 100. graines of quickſilver, and put it over a flaming fire, and when the quickſilver begins to ſmoake and flie away in fume, caſt in one part of your Elixir, and then cover it. Then let it coole, and it ſhall prove a very ſoveraigne medicine: 100. parts of quickſilver, according to the fineneſſe of it, this ſhall convert into Gold. But if you deſire to make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſee the operation upon lead, you ſhall there find it as well: neither doth it ſtay there, for its ingreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion retains that faculty to turne all mettals into Gold: to every thing it is to be applied, and it converts eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing into a well complectioned nature, halfe a graine of this taken into the mouth makes the party ſtrong; the weak and feeble, it makes ſo luſty, that no man was ever more healthy, and time which is pretious to all, brings thoſe that take it, ſound to their Graves.</p>
            <p>The beſt of Beſts invites from his ſupreame dwelling place, the moſt unfortunate of all, joyning together two extreames, after which we ſhall ſee him in his greateſt dignity and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, which now is moſt diſtant from it: ſay nothing till thou ſeeſt the water produce that which is afterward turned into fire; but if thou ſeeſt that play, then hide not what elſe thou knoweſt, for it is worth full eight hundred yeeres; for being come to that paſſe, then thou ſhalt know the worth of it. Then ſhall be accompliſht the fatall time to ſee my treaſure and my ſelfe, and myſelfe incloſed or containe my ſelfe: I ſhall not be obſcured, and thou ſhalt remaine with my gift that in this darknes thou ſhalt ſee ſuch a light where a World ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He paſt worke of the moſt pure ſtone, is ſo infinite in multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it is never weary to give, and to give more, ſuch a likeneſſe hath it to its workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But if you would know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way to ſeperate the foure Elements, know that this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe underſtood, will teach you to do it with more brevity and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Two ounces of gold well refined with one of ſilver, very fine and pure, melted in clay, and this mixture being filed very ſmall, and with purged Mercury ground untill it be well incorporated one into another. Then put ſuch a quantity of common ſalt ſo well mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as that the body may be well conglutinated.</p>
            <p>Take a glaſſe bottle, ſubtilly to mix theſe, ſo that no unclean thing may come to it (though never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) and then upon a ſmall fire ſo worke it, as that the Mercury may conſume or vaniſh in its own fume. Then you may preſume the Gold will remaine being a body that will endure the fervency of the fire.</p>
            <p>Waſh the matter of this mixture in pure fountaine water, ſo that after many waſhings, the water may remaine many times clean, and retaine its ſweetneſſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117385:10"/>
of taſte: then weigh the matter that remains, and if you find it heavier than it was at firſt, grind it againe with Salt enough, and put it to the fire againe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Thus I tell you, you muſt doe your worke, and in a very ſoft fire: and when it comes to bee of its firſt weight, that which then remaines, will bee a matter ſpungeous and ſubtle, and ſo well diſpoſed and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that you may uſe it in any Phyſicke.</p>
            <p>And now you muſt make a preparation with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed Mercury, Copperas, and Salt well waſht: for our Phyſick and reall conjunction gives it afterwards his life, grinding it with Salt very ſmall. Then in a glaſſe Bottle which hath his receiver, put it to make his diſtillation.</p>
            <p>But know that within the receiving glaſſe you muſt put water, and place the bottle in a ſtrong furnace, and make a fire of coales under it, and letting it ſeeth or boyle ſoftly, and it will turn quick, or living, and be much ſubject to corruption, and with this, worke ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and be not weary,</p>
            <p>Nine of theſe with three of the firſt compoſition, joyned and well mixed, and ground together: and all theſe and the other put into a round glaſſe, that hath a neck of a ſpan or palme long, and then ſtop the mouth very cloſe, for which purpoſe the mouth muſt not be made wide but narrow.</p>
            <p>Thus I tell you the glaſſe muſt be, and of a bigneſſe to hold the quantity of three <hi>begadas,</hi> and according to the roundneſſe of it, ſo have a place fitted to put it in the fire, that there the matter may be well joyned or maſht together, then will the tincture be made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:117385:11"/>
Forty <hi>begadas,</hi> then ſhalt thou ſee the Eaſt adorned with the beames of the ſunne, when this worke ſhall be accompliſhed according to deſire, to change the preſent glaſſe into another, which ſerves for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of a Still, which being cloſe luted with <hi>lutum ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae,</hi> on hot water, which it muſt not touch.</p>
            <p>The Fire muſt not bee of any great heat but mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that it may worke its effect, diſtilling its water in a perfect manner, and then doe the ſame worke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver againe; joine the matter with great wiſedome, with this his diſtilled Water, joine Mercury, of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall weight with the firſt matter.</p>
            <p>Note my words which I will tell thee, that now thou ſhalt come to putrifie it, and after forty dayes put it into the Still, keeping the ſame order as before, for the glaſſe and the fire, take this diſtilled water, and in the place where it falls, put in an equall weight of the firſt matter as aforeſayd.</p>
            <p>Doe this worke as at the firſt, for it muſt be thrice reiterated from time to time, receiving the water that the fire will give to the very laſt. Think not the time light, and though you paſſe the forty dayes and more, yet ſtill keepe the water in a glaſſe bottle.</p>
            <p>Change it from the receiving glaſſe into another, and put it upon hot aſhes, and then thou ſhalt have, or draw out a lighter element in weight, called Ayre, which you muſt ſubtily put into a bottle, and ſtop the mouth of it very cloſe with <hi>Hermes</hi> his ſeale, and its necke alſo; be carefull that you let not forth the aire.</p>
            <p>Put in or to the glaſſe another receiver after, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtrongly luted it) and make ſuch a fire as that by his great heat the pot may diſtill; this Element keep
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117385:11"/>
with carefulneſſe, for it is the Element of Fire, and then, thankes be to God, in this worke thou haſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the foure Elements.</p>
            <p>After the diviſion of this Chaos, thou muſt now thinke of joyning them together againe: for if thou meaneſt to joyne and make that world which was diſunited, the only matter which is in the bottome of the glaſſe muſt bee retayned or kept and ſoftned by grinding, and then the compoſition put into a glaſſe.</p>
            <p>Let this glaſſe bee round bodied, and long neckt; which glaſſe or bottle you muſt fortifie by luting, and ſet it upon the coales, that it may have the force of the fire, in ſuch a maner that it may riſe ten degrees <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> Wife of the beloved Bed; and in this maner it wilbe converted into a hard ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>In another like glaſſe put this with a quarter of its weight of the reſerved water, and then ſtop the mouth of it well, and put it in a braſſe furnace or veſſell, and put it upon hot aſhes, and keepe ſuch a fire to it, as the matter may become dry as it was before.</p>
            <p>This being done, and the congealing and drying being paſt, as I have ſaid, do the like again, with its fourth or quarter part of that Royall water. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion muſt be reitterated, and the fourth time ended of doing the ſame work, know that thou haſt ſatisfied the drougth, or drouth, or thirſt that this ſubſtance had after that water.</p>
            <p>Haſt thou not ſeen the earth when it wants raine, how barren it ſhews? no fruit to be ſeen, but all looks like a fallow ground, and every thing like to periſh. But if the rain falls to refreſh it, it makes it fruitfull for generation, or increaſe, and every ſeed that is ſown
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117385:12"/>
in its proper time brings forth its fruit.</p>
            <p>And continuing diſperſeth its watery power into all plants and trees, and makes the fruit appeare on every bough: even ſo goes this matter preparing; the Ayre which you kept in the bottle, you muſt give drink to five ſeverall times, the tenth part of its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity at a time, ſo that in all it muſt have halfe its own weight, and alwayes at every time be dryed up.</p>
            <p>Then on a Copper plate in a flaming fire try this matter, if it will conſume in ſmoake; for you muſt preſume it to be of the nature of the Ganimedes to flie up to Heaven, but if it flies not upwards, then it is not yet well done, but you muſt give it more water, and trye again whether or no it hath his true ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Cauſe it to drink a quarter part of its weight that firſt it was of, which will be the tenth part of the Aire, and as you did it before, ſo do it again: then prove it upon the Copper Plate, to trye if it will evaporate and ſmoake: then turne againe to what you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Then put the matter in ſublimation, and when you ſhall ſee it all riſe up: that which riſeth not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the bottome, give it drink again according as is aforeſayd: prove it again upon the plate, and ſo continually trye it till it riſeth; and then you ſhall be ſure that in the bottome will remain a black earth like a dead body in the glaſſe.</p>
            <p>As the Ganimedes went up to Heaven, ſo thou ſhalt ſee this matter exalted. It ſhall be demanded from the God of the earth, by <hi>Jove,</hi> from whom it was ſtolen, it having been left with <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> and ſhall be reſtored, and if thou ſublimate it, oftentimes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117385:12"/>
grinding it untill it come at laſt to be firme, it will all remain in the bottome of the glaſſe.</p>
            <p>To this matter there wants ingreſſion, becauſe there wants the fourth Element, therefore make this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in a fire neither great nor little, but when thou putteſt it in its inflammation take the pot, and be ſure that not one drop or tittle of any foule thing comes to it before thou ſeeſt infuſion.</p>
            <p>If then thou ſeeſt it become like wax that it will rope, then thou haſt a vaſt great Treaſure, that thy eſtate ſhall be advanced to more than the riches of <hi>Midas.</hi> 100. parts of Mercury put on the fire, and when it begins to fume away, then temper it with one of this matter, and preſume thou haſt brought it to the perfect medicine.</p>
            <p>And if another time thou doſt the ſame worke, one part of this applyed to 100 will turn likewiſe to the ſecond medicine, and one part of this is a great reward, being applied to 100 parts of Mercury hot, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mettal being melted, making it becom Gold moſt high and ſublime: For which the Lord be praiſed.</p>

Therefore it is neceſſary that our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine bee taken chiefly of ſuch things as it conſiſteth in; but there bee many men buſying themſelves and medling greatly and diverſly therein, that now a daies goe about to get the ſame medicine of dry ſtones, and divers kinds of ſalts, as of <hi>Sal alkali, Sal. gem. vitriol, Sal-armoniack,</hi> and allome, cicory, tutty, attramentum, ſaffron, burnt braſſe, vitrioll Romane, verdegris, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, auripigmentum, arſnick, and ſuch other unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matters, whereas neither ſalts nor alloms, doe goe into, or be compounded in our worke; but the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers named it ſalts and allomes in ſtead of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaith. But if thou deſire to make the Elixir wiſely and perfectly, then learne to know the Minerall Roots, and make of them thy worke: for as <hi>Geber</hi> ſayth, thou ſhalt not finde the terme or end of the thing in the veines of the earth; for ſulphur and mercury which be the roots minerall, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall principles, that Nature doth make the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her operations once, as in the mineralls and chambers of the Earth, be water, viſcous, and a ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſpirit running by the veines and bowells of the Earth, and of them doth ſpring a fume, which is the mother of all mettalls, joyned by a moiſt temperate heat, aſcending and verberating againe upon his upper Earth, untill that by temperate decoction in the term of 1000. years is made a certaine naturall fixation, as more plainly it doth appeare, and ſo is made mettall, as appeareth in the bookes of <hi>Geber:</hi> Even ſo of Sol,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117385:14"/>
(which is our Sulphur reduced into Mercury, by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury) is made a water, thicke, and mixed with his proper Earth, by temperate decoction, and from it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a fume of the veins of this proper Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> of himſelfe, which afterward is changed into a water, moſt ſubtle, which is called <hi>Anima, Spiritus, &amp; Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura,</hi> that is, the Soule, the Spirit, and Tincture: and when the ſame water is reduced upon the Earth from whence it came, and ſprinkled upon his owne veines, it commeth into a certaine fixation, and is made the Elixir compleat: and ſo Art doth worke in a ſhort time by the wit of man, more then Nature doth work in 1000. yeares. But yet wee doe not make mettall, but Nature doth make it: we doe not change mettals, but Nature doth change them; but we be Natures hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or Miniſters. Whereupon <hi>Medus</hi> in <hi>Turba Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophorum,</hi> ſayth, That although our Stone being perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly created in the Earth, doth naturally contayne in himſelfe tincture, yet by himſelfe, he hath no motion or moving to be Elixir, unleſſe thereto hee bee moved by Art. Therefore let us chooſe the naturall and next mineralls, according to the words of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath procreated all metalique bodies of a fume, Sulphur and Mercury: wherein thou ſhalt finde no Philoſopher diſagreeing; therfore it behoveth thee to know the principles of this Art, and the principall Roots thereof; for hee that doth not know the right beginning, ſhall never finde the right end thereof: for <hi>Geber</hi> ſayth in the beginning of his Booke, Hee that knoweth nor our beginning in himſelfe, is farre from the attayning or underſtanding of this Science: for hee hath not the true Root or ground whereon he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117385:15"/>
ſhould rayſe this Art, or Science, or Worke: alſo in another place he ſayth; It behoveth that our Art be found out by a naturall wit, and a ſubtile ſoule, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forth the naturall principles and true foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But although that a man may know his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet nevertheleſſe he cannot in this follow Nature in all things, as <hi>Geber</hi> teſtifieth. Sonne, of this Art of Alchymy, we doe open to thee a great ſecret; Many Artificers in this Art doe greatly erre, which do think to follow Nature in all properties and differences.</p>
            <p>Therefore theſe things thus ſhortly paſſed over, as is aforeſayd, let us come to that part of the worke ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall; many men doe write of the Stone, named the Philoſophers Stone, but how, or of what it is made, no Philoſopher did plainly and openly name, for in theſe points divers men taught divers things: whereas the truth doth conſiſt in one thing onely; but without doubt and without all errour, we ſay that this Stone (which is the root of our Art and privity, or hidden ſecret of God: and whereof many wiſe men did treat, who did of it make, and did knit many knots, and ſo deceived many men in making them thereby fooles) is none other thing but man and woman, <hi>Sol &amp; Luna,</hi> hot and cold, Sulphur and Mercury: and heere ſticke downe your ſtake, ſtaying only and leaving to ſearch further for any other ſtone, or fooliſhly to conſume thy money, and to bring to thy ſoule heavy thoughts, or ſadneſſe: for what thou ſoweſt thou ſhalt reape. And foraſmuch as this Stone is divided into two parts, we will ſpeake a little of the firſt part <hi>Sol;</hi> and note, that without it, our worke cannot be done, as I well prove by authority of learned Philoſophers. For <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:117385:15"/>
ſayth, of all things in this world, <hi>Sol</hi> is moſt: and it is the firment of white and red, without which it is not done. Alſo <hi>Hermes</hi> ſayth, There is no true tincture but of our Braſſe, that is to ſay <hi>Sol:</hi> for all <hi>Sol</hi> is braſs, but all braſſe is not <hi>Sol:</hi> ſo all <hi>Sol</hi> is Sulphur, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for in it is nothing of the corruption of Sulphur, but when it is made white in the worke, then it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the operation of white Sulphur, congealing and converting Mercury into Sol, of the colour named <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſon</hi> in Latine, therefore uſe alwayes the nobler member, that is to ſay Sol; for it is the kinde of kindes, and forme of formes; for it is the firſt and laſt in mettals, and it is amongſt them in their natures, as the Sun is amongſt the Stars, but it doth concerne thee to underſtand well how to chooſe in what noble member <hi>materiam vel rem homogeneam amborum mundi Luminum:</hi> that is a thing of that kinde which is a kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to both the lights in the world, that is to ſay <hi>Sol:</hi> for <hi>Sol</hi> is <hi>homogeneam,</hi> and the ſpirit hid and covered in that noble member, without which the work is not done. Wherefore <hi>Raſis</hi> ſayth, Doe not colour it untill his hid ſpirit be drawne out, and made all ſpirituall; and therefore worke thou nothing but that which is very light, and of the moſt pure <hi>Sol;</hi> which doth illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and lighten all lights, and caſteth away all darkneſſe of the night by his power, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Mercury and other imperfect bodies, when that it is caſt upon them; wherefore <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith in the Chapter of the Quinteſſence and Projection of the Stone: this Sulpher, lightning and eaſting forth his beames, and ſhining abroad of his moſt cleare ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, doth irradiate and giveth light not only in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117385:16"/>
day, but alſo in the darkneſſe wherupon <hi>Pandulphus in turba Philoſophoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſaith, my Brethren know ye that there is no body more precious or purer than Sol: for as the Rubie hath in it ſelfe the effect of all precious ſtones, ſo Sol hath in it ſelfe the vertue of all ſtones and Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals ductible; for it containeth in it ſelfe all mettals, and coloureth and quickeneth them, when he is moſt noble of them and of all bodies, and the head and the beſt of them: and conſider this one poynt more, that Sol is equall in the qualities and parts of it, and it is of a compleat nature of the foure Elements, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exceſſe or defect, for by nature it hath part of heat, and part of coldneſſe; part of dryneſſe, and part of humidity; for it is not corrupted, nor corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, by the Ayre, nor by the Water, nor by the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Earth, or by the force or violence of the Fire; yet it moyſteneth, rectifieth, and adorneth it, becauſe his complexion is temperate, and his nature direct and equall: therefore that Stone is beſt of all ſtones, that is moſt concoct and neareſt, or moſt akin to the fire.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of our Stone is called Mercury, the which is himſelfe, and of the Philoſophers is called a Stone, and yet is no Stone: Whereupon a certaine wiſe man, whereas he ſpeaketh of it, faith, this is a Stone, and yet no Stone, without which, nature doth never worke any thing, which both doth, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up the worke, and of it doth appeare every colour, whoſe name is Mercury or Argent vive. Whereupon <hi>Rasis</hi> ſaith of it, a worke may be created ſo, that the ſame worke may overcome all Natures; it is friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all Mettles, and the meane to joyne tinctures, for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117385:16"/>
in it ſelfe it receiveth that which is of its nature, and doth vomit forth againe that which is ſtrange, or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to its nature, for it is an uniforme ſubſtance in all his part. Therefore this Stone is named of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, Minerall vegitable, and Animall, and alſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall, it is called Minerall, becauſe it is ingendred in the Mine, and is mother of all Mettles, or elſe it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led minerall, becauſe that when there is projection made upon it, it is turned into Mettle, and it is called vegitable, for of the juice of three Hearbs mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in equall proportions, that they ſtand in a moiſt fire forty dayes, there will be growne forth thereof a Stone of the ſame colour and vertue of the minerall, for the Hearbs be Mercury, Purcelane, called <hi>Portulaca Marina,</hi> which yeeldeth Milke, and Celendine, it is alſo called animall or vitall, becauſe of himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other thing put into it, his Elements being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and mixt together in equall weight, and then ſet in a ſtrong glaſſe with a little hole to take ayre at in the aforeſayd fire, within three moneths there will engender horrible Wormes, whereof every one will ſlay one another, untill that one onely will remaine, which if the Maſter feed wiſely, it will grow and wax to the bigneſſe of a Toad, whoſe forme is terrible, and this Beaſt is by himſelfe Elixir upon Saturne and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, or it is called animall, becauſe it is made of a thing that hath life, that is to ſay man: For in old Hedges it is found of the putrifaction of mans dung, and ordinately heated with a ſubtile Veſſell of Glaſſe, and therefore the Philoſophers ſayd our Stone is found in every man, and that of the vileſt thing, and of a moſt vile price: Wherefore <hi>Pithagoras</hi> ſaith, this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117385:17"/>
Stone is animall, becauſe it is apt to bring forth Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; alſo he ſaith it is caſt in Dunghils, and therefore it is vile and rejected in the eyes of the ignorant man. Alſo in the Booke which is called <hi>Speculum Alchymiae,</hi> it is ſayd, this Stone is caſt away in the ſtreet, and is found in dunghills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which containeth in it ſelfe all the foure Elements, and ruleth them: and this Stone is artificiall, for by mans wit it is knit together; for certaine men make Mercury of Lead in this maner: they melt Saturne ſix or ſeven times, and every time they draw it with Sal armoniacke diſſolved; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they take of that Saturne three pounds, and of Vitriol one pound, and of Borax halfe a pound, and then they do mingle altogether, and put it underneath the Philoſophers fire, by forty naturall dayes, and then it is made Mercury, and there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene it and naturall Mercury, but that it doth not goe into our worke, as naturall Mercury doth.</p>
            <p>Know thou the clean from the unclean, for nothing giveth that which it hath not; for the clean is of one eſſence voyd of alterations: the unclean thing is divers, and of contrary parts, and of a light or eaſie corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore put in thy worke no ſtrange thing, nor let any thing goe into our Stone (except ſuch as is ſprung from it) neyther in part nor yet in the whole; for if any ſtrange thing be put into it, it will by and by corrupt, nor will that be made thereof which is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Therefore purge the yellow body by the aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fire, and then thou ſhalt finde it purged; and after that thou haſt it well purged, beat it moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and utterly, and make it into thin plates, and after beat them into leaves, the thinneſt that can bee poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117385:17"/>
as Gold-beaters doe, and then ſo keep them: but the white liquor hath more ſuperfluities, which muſt of neceſſity be removed, for they bee <hi>faeculentiae</hi> of the Earth, which is the impediment of melting, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity fugitive, which is the impediment of fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The earthineſſe feculentine is taken away thus; put it into a mortar of marble or wood, and adde to it as much common cleane dry ſalt, and a little vineger, and ſtirre them ſtrongly about, and rub it very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a peſtle of wood wiſely, that there doe appear nothing of the liquor, and that all the ſalt be all black, then waſh all the matter with cleane hot water, untill the ſalt bee reſolved into water, and then powre the ſame foule water away, and then put it to the liquor of ſalt and vineger, as thou didſt before; and doe this oftentimes, untill the liquor bee made as cleane and ſhining as glaſſe, or of the colour of Heaven. And laſt of all put it into a thicke linnen cloth, twice or thrice doubled, and then ſtraine it forth twice or thrice into a thicke veſſell of glaſſe, untill it bee dry; the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts is ſuch, for there bee twenty foure houres in a naturall day, to which adde one, and then there be twenty five, this is wiſedome: for <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith in his fourth Booke, and ſixth Chapter, Study in thy worke to overcome the quick ſilver in thy commixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Alſo <hi>Raſis</hi> ſayth, Bodies be of a great perfection; wherefore more quick ſilver is neceſſary: and he ſaith, that wiſe men hide nothing but the weight and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and this we may know becauſe none doe agree with other in weight. Therefore there is a great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; for although the medicine be well preparate and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117385:18"/>
well mingled together, unleſſe that there bee quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thou haſt deſtroyed all, as to the verity and finall complement, and that ſhalt thou ſee in the triall, for when that the body tranſmuted, bee put into cinerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there it will be conſumed late or ſoone, according as little or much it is changed into equality of the proportions by right, according to reaſon it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be corrupted: therefore no man can paſſe through it, unleſſe that hee bee a wiſe man, that doeth all things according to reaſon, and true ſubtilety, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall wit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euclides</hi> being a wiſe man, counſelled us that we ſhould worke but in Sol and Mercury, which joyned together doth make the Philoſophers Stone; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, white and red do proceed of one Roote, no body of any other kinde comming between or meddling of the kind of Sol; yet it being matter and forme abſent, all the effect is deprived, <hi>quoniam ex materia &amp; forma ſit generatio vera;</hi> that is to ſay, very true generation is made of forme and matter, therefore it behooveth thee to know, that no Stone, or precious ſtone, nor any other thing beſides this Stone is convenient, nor yet doth agree to this worke; but thou hadſt need to labor about the ſolution of the yellow body, reducing it to his firſt matter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, we truly do diſſolve Gold, that it may be reduced into his firſt nature, that is to ſay, Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and when that they be bruſed aſunder, then they have in themſelves tincture abiding: wherefore <hi>Raſis</hi> in the flowers of <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaith, make the marriage, between the Red husband and the White wife, and thou ſhalt have the maſtery.

Therefore unleſſe our braſſe be broken and cruſhed aſunder, and ruled by himſelfe untill it be drawn from his thicknes, and that it be turned into a thin ſpirit, this labour is in vaine; whereupon it is ſayd in the Booke called <hi>Speculum Alchymiae,</hi> that the firſt worke of this worke is the body reduced into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that is to Mercury, and that is that the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call ſolution, which is the foundation of all the worke, and it maketh the body of more liquefaction, and of a more hid and privy ſubtiliation, which ſaid ſolution by little and little is done by contritions, and light roſting: wherfore <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, the diſpoſition of our Stone is, that it be put into his veſſell, and be ſod dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, untill all do aſcend and riſe up and be diſſolved. And it is ſpoken in <hi>Specula Philoſophorum,</hi> that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Stone doth ariſe from a vile thing unto a more precious treaſure: that is to be underſtood, that the ſperme of Sol is to be caſt into the matrix of Mercury, by bodily copulation or conjunction, and joyning of them together. Alſo <hi>Pithagoras</hi> ſaith, that when it is put together with his like, and be mercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it is a young tree, bringing forth fruit for the ſoule; the ſpirit and the tincture may from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be drawn out of him by temperate heat: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaith, you Artificers of Alchymie, know you
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117385:19"/>
that their kindes cannot be truly tranſmuted unleſſe that it be reduced into his firſt matter: Alſo <hi>Geber</hi> ſaith, all the whole thing may be made only of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, or Lune, for when that Sol is brought into his firſt beginning by Mercury, then nature embraceth his owne proper nature, and then there is in it an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of drawing forth his ſubtill ſubſtance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Alfidius</hi> ſaith, take things of their owne mindes, and exalt them to their Roots and beginnings: Alſo the Booke called <hi>Lumen Luminum</hi> ſaith, that except that a man do caſt the red with the fairneſſe away, he can by no means come to the Sulphur, Lightning and Ruddineſs. Alſo <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith in the ſeventh Chapter, he that knoweth how to turne Sol into Luna, hee knoweth alſo how to turne Sol into Sol: wherefore <hi>Pandulphus</hi> in <hi>Turba Philoſophorum</hi> ſaith, he that hath wiſely brought forth the venome out of Sol and his ſhaddow, without which no colouring venome is ingendred, and he that goeth about by any manner of wayes to make colouring venome without this, he loſeth his labour, and enjoyeth nothing but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for all his hopes.</p>
            <p>The Veſſell of our Stone is one wherein all the maſtery is fulfilled, and it is a Cucurbit or Gourd with a Limbeck round above and beneath, plaine, without any ſcapolis, not too high, whoſe bottome be round after the faſhion of an Egge, or of an urinall, with plaine ſides, that it being made thin it may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend and deſcend moſt freely and eaſily; and let the Veſſell be of ſuch quantity, that the fourth part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may containe all the matter: and note that it is not of any other mettle but Glaſſe, cleane, which is a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Alſo <hi>Alphidanus</hi> ſaith, hide thy medicine in a moyſt horſe dung, which is the wiſe mans fire, for the fire of this dung is hot and moyſt, and obſcure, having within it humidity, and a holy light, and therefore there is none like to this in all the world, but only the naturall fire of a hot mans body; that is in health, and this is the ſecret cauſe of the ſtrife of the Sea, and not fully combuſt bloud of man, and the bloud of the red wine is our fire; the Regiment of our fires is ſuch, that the medicine to white muſt be put into the moyſt fire, untill the full compliment of whiteneſſe, and that the heat muſt be lent and continuall from the beginning, untill the colour of whiteneſſe appearing in the veſſell, for the lent fire is the conſervation of humidity; whereupon <hi>Pandolphus</hi> ſaith, Brethren, know that the body is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with the ſpirit whereunto it is mixed, by a moſt lent decoction, and ſo the body is thereby made ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall with the ſpirit: Alſo <hi>Aſtavus</hi> ſaith, the lent fire doth ſend forth the ſpirits of life, the exceſſive fire doth not make equall the Elements, but rather it waſteth the humidity and deſtroyeth all things: therefore <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith in his high worke, take heed in thy ſublimation and liquefaction, leſt that when you ſet your fire on fire, the water alſo do aſcend to the top of the veſſell, for if it be ſo, then it being cold it will ſtick there, and ſo thou canſt not make thy Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, nor open thy Elements, becauſe it is neceſſary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117385:21"/>
that every one of them in their ſphericall, or ſpirituall motion be very often thruſt downe and lift up, for on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the temperate fire is inſpicive and perfective of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore <hi>Botulphus</hi> ſaith, a lent fire which is called a cleare fire, is the greateſt cauſe of true opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Elements. Alſo <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, it is our light fire, as in an Egge that is nouriſhed, untill the body be derived, and the tincture drawne forth, for by light decoction the fire congealeth the water, and draweth forth the humidity of the corruptive part, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion of drineſſe is prevented. Alſo all the benefit of this worke is in the temperateneſſe of the fire; therefore alwayes take heed of a greater fire, that thou come not before thy time to ſolution, for that bringeth to deſperation: wherfore <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, take heed of the intention of the fire, for if it be ſet on fire before the time, then it is made Red before the due time, which doth not profit, and that he may ſhew thee the time of decoction, He ſaith, the ſolution of the body, and the congelation of the ſpirit muſt needs be made with light decoction of the fire, and with moyſt putrification in forty daies. Alſo heare <hi>Hortulanus</hi> ſaying, know ye that in mingling them together, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth you to mingle the crude, quick, ſincere, and right Elements together upon a ſoft fire, and to take heed of the intention of the fire, untill the Elements be joyned together. <hi>Bonellus</hi> ſaith alſo, by a temperate heat the body is made ſweet and convenient.</p>
               <p>Be of a conſtant minde in thy work, and do not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in or upon divers matters or things, proving ſometimes this matter, and ſometimes another; for in the multitude or diverſity of things thy Art conſiſts

Therefore cruſh it aſſunder, and ſeeth ſtill that thou be not weary: alſo <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, ſeeth without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion. Do not haſt or ceaſe at any time from thy worke, nor go about to practiſe or uſe the ſophiſticall bounds of thy works, but onely intend to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of this worke: alſo <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, it is moſt ſure for thee to apply thy worke diligently, nor do thou leave off thy worke, being as it were a tree cut downe from the bowes, be thou therefore ſtedfaſt, and of a long continuall minde and will in the Regiment. Shut moſt cloſe thy veſſell, and ceaſe at no time, for there is no generation of things but by a continuall motion, excluſion of ayre, and heat temperate. Study and marke alſo, when that you are in your worke, all the ſignes that ſhall appeare in every decoction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, for they be neceſſary for the workman, to the compliment and fulfilling of this worke, for it is neceſſary to continue the worke, and moderate the fire; therefore all theſe things diſpoſed as aforeſaid, put the veſſell with the medicine in the moyſt fire ſo, that halfe the veſſell be in the fire and the other halfe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117385:22"/>
without, to this intent, that every day it may be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon, and within forty dayes the overpart, or outſide of the medicine, ſhall appear black like Tarr, and that is a ſigne, that the yellow body is truly turned into Mercury: therefore <hi>Bonellus</hi> ſaith, where that you do ſee blackneſs appeare to that water, know ye that now the body is liquefied: and that truly is the ſame that <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, the diſpoſition of our Stone is one, that it be put in his veſſell, and that it be throughly ſodden, untill all do riſe and aſcend diſſolved. Alſo in another place, continue upon him a temperate heat, untill that it be diſſolved into water impalpable, and that all the tincture do go forth into blackneſs, which is a ſigne of ſolution.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Lucas</hi> ſayth, When thou ſeeſt blacknes inure to that water in all things, then know that the body is liquefied; for the Philoſophers doe call this blacknes the firſt mariage, for that the man is joyned to the woman, and it is a ſigne of a perfect medicine and mixtion, but all the tincture is not drawne forth all at once, but it goeth forth by little and little every day untill that in a long time it be compleat and finiſhed; and that, that is diſſolved doth ever goe up to the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, although that which is remayning beneath bee the more: whereupon <hi>Avicen</hi> ſayth, that which is ſpirituall doth aſcend up into the Veſſell, and that which is thicke and groſſe, remayneth in the Veſſell beneath: but this blacknes is named by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers with many and ſundry names; as the fire, the ſoule, the clouds, the crowes head, oyle, tincture, red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ſhadow, Sol, braſſe, blacklead, black water, ſulphur, and by many other names: and that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117385:22"/>
blacknes doth conjoyne together the ſpirit to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: wherefore <hi>Roſarius</hi> ſayth, by the continuance of the fire in the Regiment to the number of forty dayes, both ſhall be made a water permanent, the blackneſſe being covered; which ſayd blackneſſe, if it bee gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as it ought to be, it doth not ſtay away above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes of the colour of blackneſſe. Alſo <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſayth, as long as the obſcure blackneſſe doth appeare, the woman doth rule, which is the firſt ſtrength of our ſtone; for unleſſe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be black, it cannot be white nor red. Alſo <hi>Avicen</hi> in the Chapter of Humors ſaith, heat in moiſtneſſe doth firſt make blackneſſe, and his moiſtneſſe endureth untill the ſuperfluity thereof bee removed, and then it becommeth white. Alſo in our works, firſt they be made blacke, ſecondly white, and thirdly by a greater intention and compoſition of fire, it behoveth to be made yellow: whereupon it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Booke called <hi>Multifary,</hi> in the ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the firſt detection, which is called putrifaction when our Stone is made black, that is to ſay black earth, by the drawing forth of his moiſtneſſe, wherein the whiteneſſe is hid, and when the ſame whiteneſſe is reverſed upon his blackneſſe, and is fixed with his earth by eaſie roſting, then is made the white, in which whiteneſſe the redneſſe is hid, and when it is well ſodden, by augmentation of the fire the ſame earth is then turned into redneſſe, as after it ſhall be taught.</p>
               <p>Now againe let us returne to our black Stone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly cloſed in his Veſſell, let it ſtand therefore continually in the moiſt fire untill that the white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour doe appeare like unto the manner of moſt white
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117385:23"/>
Salt, and this colour according to the Philoſophers, is called Sal Armoniack, without which nothing can be made, or is profitable in our work: And ſo the intenſive whitenes appearing, the perfect mariage &amp; copulation indiſſoluble of the Stone is made: then is that of <hi>Hermes</hi> fully fulfilled, ſaying, That which is above, is as that which is beneath is. That which is above is to obtaine Miracles of one thing: But <hi>Pithagoras</hi> ſaith, when that you do ſee whitenes comming above, then be you ſure that redneſſe is hid in that whiteneſſe; but before that the white doe appeare, many colours ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Diademes</hi> ſaith, ſeeth the man and vapour together, untill that both of them be congelate into dryneſſe; for unleſſe that it be made dry, divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours will not appeare, for it is ever black, as long as moyſtneſſe doth rule, and then it ſendeth forth divers colours; for in divers manners, and at divers times, it will be moved from colour to colour, untill it come to a firme whiteneſſe: Alſo <hi>Zenon</hi> ſaith, all kinde of colours will appeare in it untill the black humidity be dryed up; but of ſuch colours take you no great care for they be no true colours; for it ſhall very often times be citrine, and very often times redneſſe will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and often times it will be dry, and alſo liquid before whiteneſſe, but the Spirit will never be fixed with the body, but with white colour. <hi>Aſtavus</hi> ſayth, betweene the blackneſſe and the white, there ſhall appeare all colours, even as many as can be named or thought of: from diverſity of which colours, divers men gave it divers names, and almoſt innumerable names: for ſome did it on purpoſe to conceale and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Art, and ſome did it of envie: but in the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117385:23"/>
Chapter of the appearing of divers colours in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, there is a definition of his blacknes: for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the blacknes and the white be extreme colours, and all other colours be meane colours, therefore as often ſoever as any thing of the blacknes doth deſcend, ſo often another colour and another doth appeare, untill it be an extreame whiteneſſe: But for deſcending, and aſcending <hi>Hermes</hi> ſaith, it aſcends from the Earth up to Heaven, and deſcends againe from the Heaven to the Earth and receiveth the ſuperiour ſtrength, and the inferiour ſtrength. And note, that if there appeare between the black and the white any yellow colour, care not for them, for they do not continue, nor are permanent, but they are ſlippery and paſſing away; for there can be no permanent nor perfect Red, except that go before it. <hi>Roſarius</hi> ſaith, no man can come from the firſt to the third, but by the ſecond; for it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the white is to be looked for in the ſecond, when that it is the compliment of all the worke, for afterwards it will never be varied into any other true permanent colour but Red.</p>
               <p>Now we have the white, therefore now it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee to make Red, for the white medicine and the red do not differ between themſelves in any eſſence, but onely in this poynt, that the red medicine hath need of a greater ſubtiliation, a longer digeſtion, and a hotter fire in his Regiment: And therefore foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the end of the operation of the white is the beginning of the operation of the Red: and foraſmuch as that which is the compliment of the one, is the beginning of the other: therefore unleſs that thou do firſt make white the medicine, thou canſt never make
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117385:24"/>
true red. But now how it ſhall be made Red, we will tell thee ſhortly. Firſt the medicine to the Red muſt be put into our moyſt fire, untill the white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour appeare, as is aforeſaid: afterwards, let the veſſell be drawn out of the fire and put it in a pot of ſifted aſhes, and warme water halfe full, and ſet your veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of glaſſe with the medicine in the aſhes unto the midſt, and under the earthen pot make a dry tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fire and continuall, but the heat of this dry fire muſt be greater by double at the leaſt, than was the heat of the moyſt fire, and by the benefit of this fire the white medicine ſhall receive Red tincture; truly thou canſt not erre if thou wilt continue the drye fire: whereupon <hi>Roſarius</hi> ſaith, with a dry ſire, and a dry calcination roſt the dry untill that it be made like Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naber. Whereto from thenceforth put nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Oyle, or vineger, or any thing whatſoever it be, untill it be roſted to a compliment of Rednes; and of a truth, the more Redder that the medicine is made, the more ſtronger it is, and of more power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is more roſted will be more Redder, and that which is moſt roſted is moſt precious, therefore with a dry fire, burne it without feare, untill that it be cloſed moſt redly: whereupon a Philoſopher ſaith, in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Red, ſeeth the white untill that it be cloathed in purple, and beauty; but ſome have it; continue the Red and the white untill it be cloathed in purple cloathing: do not ceaſe, although the Red do a little ſlack to appeare, for the fire being augmented, as I ſayd before, after white of the firſt colours appeareth a mean Red when among theſe colours ſhall appeare a yellow, but his colour is not continuing, for after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117385:24"/>
that it be perfect, Red will not much tarry to appeare, which appearing, be thou certaine that thy worke is perfect: for <hi>Hermes</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Turba Philoſophorum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween white colour and Red, there appeareth only but one colour, <hi>viz.</hi> Citrine, which is yellow, but it varieth more or leſſe: alſo <hi>Maria</hi> ſaith, when thou haſt true white, thou then afterwards ſhalt have a falſe yellow, and afterwards a perfect Red: And then thou ſhalt have the glory of the cleareneſſe of all the World.</p>

               <head>The firſt manner of Multiplication of our Medicine.</head>
               <p>ELixir is multiplyed by two manner of wayes; that is to ſay, by ſolution of heat, and by ſolution of drying: by ſolution of heat is thus. Take the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and put it into the veſſell of glaſſe, and bury it in our moyſt fire ſeven dayes or more, untill that the Medicine be diſſolved into water without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blouſneſſe appearing in it. But the ſolution of drying is that that ſhall take the veſſell of glaſſe with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and hang it in a braſs pot (having a ſtraight mouth) in boyling, and let the mouth be cloſe, that by the vapour of the boyling vapour aſcending, the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine may be diſſolved. And note, that the ſame boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling water muſt not touch the veſſell of glaſſe with the medicine, by the ſpace of three fingers: and this ſolution is made ſtrongly in one day, or two, or three. After that the medicine is made and diſſolved, take it from the fire to coole, to fix, to congeale, to harden or dry, and ſo let it bee very often diſſolved, for the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117385:25"/>
oftner it be reſolved, ſo much the more perfect it is; whereupon <hi>Bonellus</hi> ſaith, when that our braſſe is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and very oftentimes reitterate, it is made better then it was before, and ſuch a ſolution is a ſubtiliation of the medicine, and his vertuous ſublimation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the oftner it is ſublimate or ſubtiliated, ſo much oftner it getteth a greater Virtue, and a greater tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and coloureth more abundantly, and the more it ſhall make perfect and convert, and turne the more; whereupon in the fourth ſolution it ſhall get ſo much virtue and tincture, that one part ſhall be able upon 1000. of Mercury cleanſed, that it ſhall convert it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gold or Silver, better then that which is taken out of the Mines of the Earth: Whereupon <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, the multiplication of this goodneſſe dependeth whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the often reitteration of the ſublimations and fixation of the perfect medicine, for the oftner that the order of this compliment be reitterated, ſo much more doth increaſe the nouriſhment thereof, and the vertue and ſtrength thereof is augmented: for the oftner then was wont that thou ſhalt ſublimate and diſſolve the perfect medicine, ſo much the more oftner thou ſhalt win and gaine at every time to caſt one upon 1000. as if at firſt it fall upon 1000. the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time it will convert 10000. the third time it will be caſt upon, and convert 100000. and the fourth time upon 1000000. the fift time upon an infinite: For <hi>Merodus</hi> ſaith, know ye for certainty, that how much the more and oftner our Stone is diſſolved, ſo much the more is the ſpirit and body conjoyned together, and of this for every time the tincture is multiplyed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way of multiplication is another way;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117385:25"/>
the medicine is multiplyed by fermentation, for the ferment to white is pure Silver, and the firment to red is pure Gold: therefore caſt one part of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine upon ten parts, or twenty of the firment, and all ſuch ſhall be medicine; and put it upon the fire in a Veſſell of Glaſſe, and ſhut it well, ſo that no ayre may enter nor paſſe forth, and let it be diſſolved or ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated ſo often as thou wilt; and as thou doeſt the firſt medicine, and one part of the ſecond medicine ſhall receive as much as one part of the firſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Whereupon <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, now have we fully made our medicine, hot and cold, dry and moiſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually temperate, whereof whatſoever we doe put to it ſhall be of the ſame complexion that it is put to; therefore conjoyne or marry him that he may bring forth fruit like unto himſelfe: But yet doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne or marry it with any other thing to convert it, but with it that it was in the beginning; whereupon it is written in <hi>Speculum,</hi> this ſpirituall earth which is the Elixir, muſt be firſt in his owne body, from whence it was taken at the beginning of his ſolution, that is to marry his earth, and it being ſo rectified and purified by his ſoule to conjoyne it by conjunction of his body, from whence it had its beginning; alſo it is ſayd in the Booke called <hi>Gemma ſalutaris,</hi> the white Worke hath need of a white firmentation; whereby when he is white with his white firmentation, and when he is made red in his red firment, for then that white earth is firment of firment, for when it is joyned to Luna, all is firment to caſt upon Mercury, and upon every body being unperfect mettle to make it Luna: And with the red thereof muſt be joyned Sol; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117385:26"/>
that is medicine upon Mercury, and Luna to make it Sol. Alſo <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, it behooveth that he be mingled with wite and red quickſilver of his kinde, and that it be contained and kept that it fly not away; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we bid that quickſilver be mingled with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, untill that one cleare water be made of two quickſilvers, and not to make three mixtures untill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them be diſſolved into water; but in their conjunction put a little of the Worke upon much of the body, as upon foure, and in a certaine time it will be made in the nature of powder, which is of red or white colour, and this powder is Elixir compleate. And truely the Elixir muſt be of a ſimple powder; alſo <hi>Egidius</hi> ſaith to 25 Stones of ſolution, put ſolution, and to ſolution deſiccation, and put all to the fire, and keepe the fume, and take heed that nothing flye from it, tarry and dwell nigh the Veſſell, and behold and obſerve the marvellous working, how it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from colour to colour in leſſe then an houre of a day, untill that it commeth to the marke or prick, or butt of whiteneſſe or redneſſe, for it will ſoone melt in the fire, and come all into the Ayre; for when the fume doth fill the fire, it will enter into the body, and the ſpirit will then be pulled together, and the body will then be fixed, cleare white or red: Then divide the fire, ſuffering it to coole, and be cold: For and if one of theſe doe fall upon 1000. or Mercury, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body, it turneth it into the beſt Gold or Silver, according as his firment is prepared; wherefore it doth appeare, that he who doth not congeale quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver that will ſuffer the fire, and joyne it to pure Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he deſireth no right way to the white worke; and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117385:26"/>
he who doth not make a red quickſilver that can ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine all fire, and joyn it to meer gold, he taketh not the right way to the Red worke, for by ſolution and fermentation the worke or medicine may be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed into an infinite: and note that the Elixir giveth a very light fuſion or melting even like wax: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Roſarius</hi> ſaith, our medicine neceſſarily ought to be of a moſt ſubtile ſubſtance and pure adherence, cleaving to Mercury of his nature, and of a moſt thin, and eaſie liquefaction as water; alſo in the booke which is named <hi>Omne datum optimum,</hi> when the Elixir is well prepared, it ought to be melted upon a burning plate, or upon a burning cole, even as wax melteth, for that thou doſt in the white, doe it in the red, for the ſame is the operation of both, as well in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication, as in the projection. <hi>Geber</hi> the Philoſopher doth beare witneſſe in his fift Booke, and tenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that there be three Orders of Medicines; of the firſt Order is that which is caſt upon imperfect bodies, and doth not take away the corruption, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for it doth give tincture, but that tincture doth go away in examination.</p>
               <p>The medicine of the ſecond Order, is that which is caſt upon imperfect bodies, and doth give tincture to them in examination; for after the examination the tincture doth remaine, but all the corruption of the bodies is not cleare taken away for ever by that medicine.</p>
               <p>In the third Order, the medicine is that which is caſt upon imperfect bodies, and taketh away all their imperfection and corruption, and from corrupt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls it bringeth them into incorruptible. But the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117385:27"/>
two firſt of theſe medicines being left off, we will ſpeake ſomething of the projection of this medicine of the third degree.</p>
               <p>The perfect medicine truly is caſt 1000. or upon more, according as the medicine is prepared or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by diſſolution, ſublimation, and ſubtilliation; but becauſe ſo little, that is, ſo little is caſt upon ſo little, by reaſon of the littlenes thereof, it ſhould not be lift up before his virtue be fulfilled. Therefore the Philoſophers made their projection diverſly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the beſt way.</p>
               <p>Let one part be caſt upon a hundred of Mercury, and all is medicine, and it is called the ſecond medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; and let every one part of this ſecond medicine be caſt upon a hundred of Mercury, and all is medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and is called the third medicine, and is made 1000. yet againe, let every part of this third medicine be caſt upon 1000. of mercury, and it ſhall be medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and all ſhall be the beſt Luna or Sol. And note that the third and the ſecond may be ſo much diſſolved, and ſubtilliate, that it ſhall receive a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vertue, and that it may be multiplyed in an infinite: after receive and make projection; firſt multiply 10. into 10. and it will make 100. and 100. by 10. multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed will be 1000. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But how the projection ought to be made, ſhall be now taught. Put the body upon the fire in a Crucible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo if it be a ſpirit tepeſcat, let it do like luke-warme water, and caſt the Elixir into it, as is aforeſaid, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it well, and very ſoone when the Elixir is lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and hath mingled it ſelfe with the body, or with the ſpirit, remove it from the fire, and thou ſhalt have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117385:27"/>
by the grace of God, gold, and ſilver, according as the Elixir is prepared.</p>
               <p>In ſhort therefore, it appeareth by the premiſſes, that our worke doth conſiſt in the body of Magneſia finiſhed; that is, of Sulphur, the which is called Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of Sulphur, and Mercury, which is called Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury of Mercury: Therefore as it is aforeſayd, with one thing, that is our Stone, with one part, that is to ſay ſeething, and one diſpoſition, that is to ſay, firſt, making of it blacke; ſecondly, with making of it white; thirdly, with making of it red; and fourthly, with making of projection, all the whole maſtery is finiſhed.</p>

Wife men have ſpoken of this in many names, but know thou right well, that it is but one matter which doth ſticke unto Argent vive, and to bodies, and thou ſhalt have the true ſignes; yet left thou ſhouldeſt be deceived heereby thou mayſt know what Argent vive is to ſtick unto: Argent vive doth ſtick to the bodies, which is falſe; for they think that they do underſtand that Chapter of <hi>Gebar,</hi> of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent vive, wherein he ſaith, when in ſearching in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he doth not find by our invention any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be more agreeable unto nature then Argent vive
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:117385:40"/>
of the bodies; for this place is to be underſtood of Argent vive Philoſophicall, for that Argent vive only ſticketh and tarrieth in, and with the bodies: and the old Philoſophers could find no other matter, nor can thoſe which be Philoſophers now invent any other matter which will abide with the bodies, but Argent vive of the Philoſophers; for common Argent vive doth not ſtick to the bodies, but the bodies do ſtick to that Argent vive, and this is certaine by experience; for if the Argent vive common be joyned with any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Argent vive abides in his proper nature, or flies away, and doth not turne the body into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, and therefore he doth not cleave unto the bodies; and for this cauſe many be deceived in working in common Argent vive, for our Stone, that is to ſay, Argent vive accidentall which doth advance himſelfe far above Gold, and doth overcome it, and he doth kill, and he doth quicken; for thou muſt know that Argent vive, father of all marvellous things of this our maſtery is congealed, and is both ſpirit and body; and this is that Argent vive which <hi>Gebar</hi> did ſpeake of, the conſideration of a very matter which doth make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is the conſideration of a choſen pure ſubſtance of Argent vive, but chiefly out of whom the ſubſtance of Argent vive may be drawne out is to be inquired of: and we making anſwer do ſay, that in them in whom it is, out of them it may be drawne; therefore Sonne, conſider well, and ſee from whence that ſubſtance is, and take that and none other: if thou deſire to come to knowledge I ſay unto thee, for love of Chriſt that by no other means we can it finde; now the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers never might finde any other matter that would

continue in the fire, but that only which is unctuous, perfect, and incombuſtible, and that matter, when it is prepared as it ought, will turne all bodes Minerall which it toucheth rightly unto moſt perfect Sol com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and above all bodies Lune.</p>
               <p>Seeth firſt with wind, and afterwards without winde, untill thou haſt drawne out of thy ſubject or matter the venome (which is called the ſoule;) that is it which thou ſeekeſt, called the everlaſting <hi>aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae</hi> for alldiſeaſes, the whole maſtery is in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. <hi>Avicen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the body be put in a fire kindled for forty dayes by elementall heat; then in that decoction of forty dayes, the body will rejoyce with the ſoule, and the ſoule will rejoyce with the body and ſpirit, and the ſpirit will rejoyce with the body and ſoule, and they are made immortall and perpetuall without ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
