         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Our most deare Father, of blessed memory, deceased,</hi> for many weighty and important reasons of State, and at the humble suit of his Commons in Parliament, did heretofore publish two seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Proclamations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one bearing date the nine and twentieth day of September, in the two &amp; twentieth yeere of his Highnesse Reigne of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of <hi>Scotland</hi> the eight and fiftieth, and the other the second day of March then next following, by both of them vtterly prohibiting the importation &amp; vse of all Tobacco, which is not of the proper growth of the Colonies of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Sommer-Ilands,</hi> or one of them, with such Cautions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vnder such Paines and Penalties, as are in those Proclamations at large expressed.</p>
            <p>And whereas Our sayd Father, by another Proclamation bearing date the thirtieth day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, in the seuenteenth yeere of his Highnesse Reigne of <hi>England,</hi> did straitly charge all and euery person or persons, of what degree or condition soeuer, that they should not from the second day of February then next following, presume to Sowe, Set, or Plant, or cause to be sowen, set, or planted within this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> any sort or kinde of Tobacco whatsoeuer, and that they, or any of them should not maintaine and continue any old Stockes or Plants of Tobacco formerly sowen or planted, but should foorthwith destroy and roote vp the same.</p>
            <p>And wheras We, finding the said Proclamations to be grounded vpon many weighty reasons and considerations, did since Our Accesse to Our Crowne, by Our Proclamation lately publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, renew and confirme the said former prohibitions: Neuerthelesse, because the immoderate desire of taking of Tobacco hath so farre preuailed in these Our Kingdomes, as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not on a sodaine bee vtterly suppressed, and the difference, or, at least, the opinion of difference betweene Spanish or forreine Tobacco, and Tobacco of the Plantations of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and of Our owne Dominions, is such, that Our Subiects can hardly be induced totally to forsake the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Tobacco; whereby it commeth to passe, That where Wee were willing to haue suffered losse in Our Customes, so as the sayd forreigne Tobacco might haue been kept out, the same is secretly, and by stealth brought in in great quantities, and many great quantities of Tobacco are set and sowen within this Our Realme of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and so the mischiefe, intended to be redressed, is not auoided, and yet Our Reuenue in Our Customes is much diminished.</p>
            <p>Wee therefore, taking into Our Princely consideration, as wel the present estate of these times, and how many important necessities doe at this instant presse Us, that by all good meanes Wee should husband Our Reuenue to the best, and also considering the many inconueniences which doe and will arise, both to Our selues and to Our Subiects, by the secret importation of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Tobacco, and planting of English Tobacco, whereby diuers of Our Subiects haue taken liberty to themselues, for the desire of priuate gaine, without respect to the publique, to make such frequent sale of the same, as that thereby not onely Our Plantations abroad are much hindered, but Our Customes also are much impayred, Wee haue thought fit, by the aduice of Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
<pb facs="tcp:28979:2"/>
for Our Reuenue, as Our first part of proceeding concerning Tobacco, to restrain<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wholly the planting of Tobacco within these Our Realmes, or any the Iles thereto belonging, and to forbid the importation of forreine Tobacco. And yet to giue way to the infirmitie of Our Subiects for the present, by the allowing the importation of some smal quantity of Spanish or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine Tobacco, not being of the growth of the English Plantations, not exceeding the quantitie of fiftie thousand weight in any one yeere to bee brought in by Our owne Commissioners onely, and to Our owne particular vse onely, and not otherwise.</p>
            <p>And to the end that the extraordinary liberty now taken, may be restrained, the said Colonies or plantations not hindered, nor Our Selfe deceiued in Our Customes, Wee haue likewise by the aduice aforesaid, thought it requisite, to imploy some persons of trust and qualitie to be Our Commissioners in this Seruice, to, and for Our owne proper vse, and vpon accompt to be giuen to Us for the same.</p>
            <p>Wee doe therefore hereby publish and declare Our Royall will and pleasure, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the seuerall Proclamations before mentioned, We are well contented to giue way to the importation and sale of so much Spanish and forreine Tobacco, as shall not exceede the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of fifty thousand weight in any one yeere, as aforesaid, and that the same shall bee Our owne Merchandise and Commodity, and be managed and disposed of by Our owne Commissioners, or such as they shall appoint for Our vse, and not otherwise.</p>
            <p>And, because that no man shall presume, by colour of this Our Licence or toleration, to import any other, or greater quantity of Spanish or forreine Tobacco, nor vtter or put the same to sale, to the preiudice of Our Seruice hereby especially intended, and to the ouerthrow of Our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Plantations abroad, Wee doe hereby straitly charge and command, that no man, other then Our owne Commissioners, for Our owne proper vse, presume to import any forreine To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco into Our Realmes of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any parts thereof.</p>
            <p>And for their better assistance therin, and the preuention of all abuses, Wee haue thought fit, and so ordaine, and doe by these presents publish Our Royall pleasure, That all Tobacco that shall from hencefoorth be imported into this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> whether it be Spanish, or of the growth of <hi>Virginia,</hi> the <hi>Sommer-Ilands,</hi> or the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> or other adiacent Ilands, beeing English Plantations, shall be brought into Our Port of <hi>London</hi> onely: Also that there shall bee three seuerall Seales kept by Our Commissioners in some conuenient place, where they shall appoint, vnder three lockes, whereofthree of Our Commissioners shall keepe three seuerall Keyes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both all such forrein Tobacco, as shalbe so imported, as aforesaid, as also such other Tobacco of the growth of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Sommer-Ilands,</hi> and other the said Plantations as shall be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, shall be sealed, That is to say, for that of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the <hi>Sommer-Ilands,</hi> a Seale engrauen with Our Armes, and for that of the other English Plantations, a Seale engrauen with a Lion and a Crowne, and for the other forreine Tobacco, a Seale engrauen with a broad Arrow and a Portcullice, without paying any thing for the sealing of the Tobacco of <hi>Virginia,</hi> and <hi>Sommer-Ilands,</hi> and other the said Plantations, but onely what the parties themselues shall thinke fit to allow for the sealers paines, waxe, and threed.</p>
            <p>And We doe hereby will and Command, that no person or persons whatsoeuer, whether Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, or Stranger, or borne within any of Our Realms or Dominions, doe presume, attempt, or goe about to counterfeit the said Seales, or any of them, and that no person or persons whatsoeuer, other then Our Commissioners, their deputie or deputies doe presume, attempt, or goe about to import any Spanish or forreine Tobacco whatsoeuer, or to buy, vtter, or sell any Tobacco, of what sort soeuer, but such as the Roule thereof shall be sealed with one of the Seales aforesaid, or to import any other, or greater quantitie of Spanish Tobacco, then the said fiftie thousand weight onely in any one yeere, or to sowe, set, or plant, or cause to be sowen, set, or planted in any of his, or their grounds, any Tobacco whatsoeuer, within Our Realmes of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or any Isles or places belonging thereto, or permit, or suffer any old stockes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly set to continue, vpon paine of forfeiture vnto Us, of all such Tobacco as shall be imported, set, sowen, planted, suffered, vttered, or put to sale, contrary to the true meaning of these presents, and to haue the same English Tobacco vtterly destroyed, in whose hands soeuer the same shall be found, and vpon such further paines and penalties, as by the Lawes and Statutes of this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> or by the seueritie, or censure of Our Court of Star-chamber, or by Our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue Royall may be inflicted vpon the offenders for their contempt of this Our Royall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the one moitie of all which fines to be imposed vpon any the said offenders, Wee are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased shalbe bestowed vpon the persons that shall informe against them for the same; and that such person or persons as shall discouer any planting of Tobacco within Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> or other Our Realmes or Dominions, shall haue his charges expended in following of Suite against the offendors, allowed out of Our part of the fines to be imposed, besides his moitie aforesaid.</p>
