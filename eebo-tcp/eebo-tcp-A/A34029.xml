         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THeſe <hi>Reports</hi> (the firſt except the Lord Chief
Juſtice <hi>Vaughans</hi> Arguments that have been
yet printed of Caſes adjudged ſince His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
happy Reſtauration) though they are not Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
under the Name of any Eminent Perſon, as ſome
other Spurious Ones have been, to gain thereby a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
which in themſelves they could not Merit;
yet have been Collected by a Perſon of Ability and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Communicated to ſeveral of known Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Laws, who think them not Inferior to many
Books of this Nature which are admitted for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
A great and well-ſpread Name may be Requiſite
to render a Book Authentick, and to defend it from that
common Cenſure, of which this Age is become ſo very
liberal. But its own worth is that only which can make
it <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful and Inſtructive.</p>
            <p>The Reader will find here ſeveral Caſes (as well ſuch
as have been Reſolved upon our modern Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as others relating to the Common Law) which are
<hi>primae Impreſſionis,</hi> and not to be found in any of the
former Volumns of the Law; and the Pith and Subſtance
of divers Arguments, as well as Reſolutions of the
Reverend Judges, on many other weighty and difficult
Points.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62849:3"/>
And indeed, though in every Caſe, the main thing
which it behoves <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to know, is, what the Judges take
and define to be Law: yet the ſhort and conciſe way of
reporting it, which is affected in ſome of our Books, doth
very ſcantily anſwer the true and proper end of reading
them; which is not only to know what is Law, but upon
what Grounds and Reaſons 'tis adjudged ſo to be; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Student is many times at a loſs, and left in the
dark; eſpecially where he finds other Reſolutions which
ſeem to have a tendency to the contrary Opinion.</p>
            <p>In this reſpect, theſe <hi>Reports</hi> will appear to be more
ſatisfactory and inlightning than many others: ſeveral
of the Caſes (eſpecially thoſe of the moſt important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration)
containing in a brief and ſummary way what
hath been offered by the Counſel <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and the
Debates of the Reverend Judges, as well as their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Reſolutions; than which nothing can more Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the Advantage of the ſtudious Reader, and to
the ſetling and guidance of his judgment, not only in
the Point controverted, but likewiſe in other matters of
Law, where the Reaſon is the ſame. <hi>Ubi eadem ratio,
idem jus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the truth of theſe <hi>Reports,</hi> though the modeſty of
the Gentleman who Collected them, hath prevailed above
the importunity of the <hi>Book-Seller,</hi> and he hath rather
choſen to ſee his Book, than himſelf gain the Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
and Applauſe, whereby it hath loſt ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Advantage, which the prefixing of his Name would
have undoubtedly given it; yet the Reader may reſt
aſſured, that no little Care hath been taken to prevent
any Miſtakes or Miſ-repreſentations. The Judgments
having been examined, and the Authorities here cited
induſtriouſly compared with the Books out of which they
were taken.</p>

if that were an Aſſault? The Court agreed that it was not: for
he declared, that he would not Aſſault him the Iudges being in

Therefore if one ſtrike another upon the hand or arm, or breaſt,
in diſcourſe, its no Aſſault, there being no intention to Aſſault:
But if one intending to Aſſault, ſtrike at another and miſs

                  <p>AN Information of Extortion againſt <hi>Troy</hi> an Attorney;
It was moved in arreſt of Iudgment, That Attorneys
are not within any of the Statutes againſt Extortion, and
therefore the Information concluded ill, the concluſion being
<hi>contra formam Statuti. Twiſd.</hi> The Statute of 3 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 7.
is expreſs againſt Attornies. <hi>Keel.</hi> I think as thus adviſed,
that Attornies are within all the Statutes of Extortion. It
was afterwards moved in arreſt of Iudgment, becauſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
was inſufficient in the Law: for Sir <hi>Tho. Fanſhawe</hi>
informed, that Mr. <hi>Troy</hi> being an Attorney of the Court of
<hi>Common Pleas,</hi> did at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> cauſe one <hi>Collop</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded
for 9 s. 4 d. debt, at the ſuit of one <hi>Dudley Sellinger,
&amp;c.</hi> and this was <hi>ad grave damnum</hi> of <hi>Collop, &amp;c.</hi> but it is
not expreſſed in what Court he cauſed him to be impleaded;
and that which the Defendant is charged with is not an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
for he ſaith that he did cauſe him to be impleaded, and
received the money the ſame day, and perhaps he received the
money after he had cauſed him to be impleaded: Then it is
not ſufficiently alledged that he did <hi>illicite</hi> receive ſo much,
and Extortion ought to be particularly alledged. Nor is there
any Statute, that an Attorney ſhall receive no more than his
juſt Fées. The profeſſion of an Attorney is at Common Law,
and allowed by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm. 1. cap.</hi> 26. and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62849:9"/>
Statute of 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> does not extend to this matter. <hi>Non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat</hi>
in this caſe, if what he received was for Fees or no: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the ſuit for an offence againſt that Statute muſt be
brought by the party, not by Sir <hi>Tho. Fanſhawe. Keel.</hi> If
the party grieved will not ſue for the penalty of treble damages
given by that Statute; yet the King may proſecute to turn him
out of the Roll. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> I doubt that: nor is it clear, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Information will lie at all upon that Statute or not,
for the Statute does not ſpeak of an Information. <hi>Keel.</hi>
Whenever a Statute makes a thing criminal, an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will lie upon the Statute, though not given by expreſs
words. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> It appears here, that this money was not
received of his Client, for he was againſt <hi>Collop.</hi> But he
ought to ſhew in what Court the impleading was; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it might be before Mr. <hi>Major</hi> in his Chamber. To
which the Court agreéd. So the Information was quaſh'd.</p>

Prin, Clerke.</hi> Objected, That <hi>Prin</hi> had not taken the
Oath according to the Act for Vniformity; whereupon he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a Certificate of the Biſhop that had only a ſmall bit of
Wax upon it. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> If it were ſealed, though the Seal be
broken off, yet it may be read, as we read Recoveries after
the Seal broken off; and I have ſeen Adminiſtration given in
Evidence after the Seal broken off, and ſo Wills and Déeds.
Accordingly it was read. <hi>Obj.</hi> The Church is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void
by the Act of Vniformity, if the Incumbent had no Epiſcopal
Ordination. So they ſhewed that <hi>Prin</hi> was ordained by a
Biſhop. It was likewiſe proved that he had declared his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and conſent to the Common Prayer in due time, before
St. <hi>Bartholomew's</hi> day. Then it was urged, that the Act
does not confirm the Plaintiffs Leſſor in this living; for that
it is not a living with Cure of Souls; for it has a Vicarage
endowed. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> If it be a living without Cure, the Act
does not extend to it. Mr. <hi>Solicitor.</hi> The Preſentation does
not mention Cure of Souls. (So they read a Preſentation
of a Rector, and another of a Vicar, in neither of which any
mention was made of Cure of Souls: but the Vicars was
<hi>reſidendo.)</hi> If both be preſentative, the Cure ſhall be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be in the Vicar. <hi>Keeling.</hi> Why may not both have
the Cure? <hi>Sol.</hi> If the Vicar be endow'd, the Rector is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of Reſidence by Act of Parliament. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
and Procurations are duties due to the Ordinary; which
Vicars, when the Parſonages are impropriated, always pay:
but I queſtion whether they that come into a Church by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
to, and Inſtitution by the Biſhop, have not always
the Cure of Souls? It is true in <hi>Donatives,</hi> where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
do not come in by the Biſhops Inſtitution, there is
no Cure: but they that come in by Inſtitution of the
Biſhop, have their power delegated to them from him, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62849:12"/>
generally have Cure of Souls. <hi>Solic.</hi> There are ſeveral
Rectories without Cure. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> When came Rectories in?
<hi>Morton.</hi> After the Counſel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and Vicars came in
in the Seventeenth year of King <hi>John. Moreton.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Councel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> the Biſhop did provide Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and received the Tythes himſelf; but ſince he hath
appointed others to the charge, and ſaith, <hi>accipe curam
tuam &amp; meam. Keeling &amp; Twiſden.</hi> It is ſaid ſo by
my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> but not done. <hi>Twiſden.</hi> Wherever
there is a Cure of Souls, the Church is viſitable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Biſhop, if it belong to him: if to a Lay-man,
he muſt make Delegates: if to the King, my Lord Kéeper
does it. And where a man comes in by Preſentation,
he is <hi>prima facie</hi> viſitable by the Biſhop. <hi>Keeling.</hi> I take
it, that whoever comes in under the Biſhops Inſtitution,
hath the Cure. <hi>Twiſden. Grendon's Caſe</hi> is expreſly, That
the Biſhop hath the Cure of Souls of all the Dioceſs, and
doth by Inſtitution transfer it to the Parſon: ſo that <hi>prima
facie,</hi> he that is inſtituted hath the Cure. The Vicarage is
derived out of the Parſonage; and if the Vicar come to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
the Parſon is bound to maintain him. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> There
is an Appropriation to a Corporation; the Corporation cannot
have Cure of Souls, being a body Politick; but when they
appoint a Vicar, he coming under the Biſhop by Inſtitution,
hath Cure of Souls: and a Donative, when it comes to
be Preſentative, hath Cure of Souls. <hi>Keeling</hi> agreed.
<hi>Twiſd.</hi> We hold that when the Rector comes in by Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Biſhop hath power to viſit him for his Doctrine and
his life; for he hath the particular Cure, but the Biſhop
the general; and that the Biſhop hath power to deprive
him.</p>

Moreton.</hi> If a Leet neglect to chuſe a Conſtable,

<hi>Affidavits,</hi> that there never was any Conſtable there. And I

let him traverſe, that there never was any ſuch Office there.
<hi>Keeling.</hi> Go and be ſworn, or if the Iuſtices of the Peace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

If there be a Court Leet that hath the choice of a petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,
the Iuſtices of Peace cannot chuſe there: And if it

in the Common Pleas upon a ſpecial Verdict in an
<hi>Ejectione firmae.</hi> The Iury found that one <hi>Simon Mayne</hi> was
poſſeſt of a Rectory for a long term, and having conveyed the
whole term in part of it to certain perſons abſolutely, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
his term in the reſidue, being two parts, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<hi>ſc.</hi> in truſt for himſelf during life, and afterwards in
truſt for the payment of the Rent reſerved upon the original
Leaſe, and for ſeveral of his Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Provided, that if
he ſhould have any iſſue of his body at the time of his death,
then the truſts to ceaſe, and the Aſſignment to be in truſt for
ſuch iſſue, &amp;c. and there was another <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that if he were
minded to change the uſes, or otherwiſe to diſpoſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes,
that he ſhould have power ſo to do by writing in the
preſence of two or more Witneſſes, or by his laſt Will and
Teſtament. They further find, that he had Iſſue male at the
time of his death, but made no diſpoſition purſuant to his
power: and that in his life time he had committed Treaſon,
and they find the Act of his Attainder. The queſtion was,
whether the reſt of the term that remained unexpired at the
time of his death, were forfeited to the King? The points
made were two. 1. Whether the Deed were fraudulent?
2. Whether the whole term were not forfeited by reaſon of the
truſt, or the power of revocation. <hi>Pemberton</hi> argued, that
the Deed was fraudulent, becauſe he took the profits during
his life, and the Aſſignees knew not of the Deed of truſt. The
Court hath in theſe caſes adjudged fraud upon circumſtances
appearing upon Record, without any Verdict: the caſe that
comes neareſt to this is in <hi>Lane; 42. &amp;c.</hi> The King againſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62849:14"/>
the <hi>Earl of Nottingham</hi> and others. <hi>2dly,</hi> He argued, that
there was a Truſt by expreſs words; and if there be a Truſt,
then not only the Truſt, but the Eſtate, is veſted in the King
by the expreſs words of the Stat. of 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can have no larger Eſtate in the Land, then the perſon
attainted had in the Truſt; and if this Conveyance were in
Truſt for <hi>Simon Mayne</hi> only during his life, the King can
have the Land no longer; but he conceived it was a Truſt
for <hi>Simon Mayne</hi> during the whole term. A Truſt, he ſaid,
was a right to receive the profits of the Land, and to diſpoſe
of the Lands in Equity. Now if <hi>Simon Mayne</hi> had a right
to receive the profits, and a preſent power to diſpoſe of the
Land, he took it to be a Truſt for him: and that conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by his attainder it was forfeited to the King. <hi>Coleman
contra:</hi> As for the matter of Fraud, firſt there is no Fraud
found by the Iury, and for you to judge of Fraud upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
is againſt the <hi>Chancellor of Oxfords caſe, 10th
Rep.</hi> As for the Truſt, it muſt be agreed, that if there be
any either Truſt or Condition by conſtruction upon theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoes
in <hi>Simon Mayne</hi> in his life, between <hi>Mich.</hi> 1646. and
the time of making the Act, the Truſt will be veſted in the
King: but whether will it be veſted in the King, as a Truſt
or as an Eſtate? For I am informed, that it hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
between the King and <hi>Holland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Styles Reports;</hi> That
if an Alien purchaſe Copy-hold Lands, the King ſhall not
have the Eſtate, but as a Truſt; and the particular reaſon
was, becauſe the King ſhall not be Tenant to the Lord of the
Mannor. <hi>Keeling.</hi> The Act of Parliament takes the Eſtate
out of the Truſtees, and puts it in the King. <hi>Coleman.</hi> But
I ſay here is no Truſt forfeitable. By the body of the Déed
all is out of him. If a man makes a feoffment in Fée to the
uſe of his Will, becauſe he hath not put it out of him, there
ariſes an Vſe and a Truſt for himſelf. But in our caſe, he
hath put the Vſes out of himſelf: for there are ſeveral Vſes
declared. But there is a further difference: if <hi>Simon Mayne</hi>
had declared the Vſe to others abſolutely, and had reſerved li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to himſelf to have altered it by his Will, that might
have altered the caſe: But here the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is, That if at the
time of his death he ſhall have a Son, &amp;c. ſo that it is reduced
to him upon a Condition and Contingency. As to the power
of Revocation, he cited the Duke of <hi>Norfolks caſe</hi> in <hi>Engle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields

                  <p>IN a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Recogniſance in Chancery entered

Court could give Iudgment upon the demurrer? <hi>Jones.</hi>
The Iudgment upon the demurrer muſt be given in Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The Court of Chancery cannot try an Iſſue, and
therefore it is ſent hither to be tryed: but with the demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
this Court has nothing to do. Indeed the books differ
in caſe of an Iſſue ſent hither out of Chancery, whether
the Iudgment ſhall be here or there: <hi>Keilway</hi> ſays, it ought
to be given here. My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> ſays, it muſt
be given in Chancery. But none ever made it a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iudgment upon a demurrer were to be given here or there?
<hi>V. Co. Juriſdiction of Courts, fol. 80. Saunders contra.</hi>
When there is a demurrer upon part, and Iſſue upon part,
the Record being here, this Court ought to give Iudgment;
becauſe there can be but one Execution. <hi>Keeling.</hi> If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
come hither entirely, we cannot ſend it back again: I
cannot find one Authority that the Record ſhall be removed
from hence. He cited <hi>Keilway 941. 21 H. 7. Co. 2. 12. Co.
Entries, 678. 24 Ed. 3. fol.</hi> 65. there it is held, that Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall be given here upon a demurrer. Now if it muſt
not be given here, there muſt be two Executions for the ſame
thing, or elſe they muſt looſe half, for they can have but one
<hi>Elegit.</hi> At another day the Iudges gave their Opinions ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
that Iudgment ought to be given in this Court upon
the whole Record: for that it is an entire Record, and the
Execution one; and if Iudgment were to be given there upon
the demurrer, there muſt be two Executions. And becauſe
the Record ſhall not be remanded. <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſaid, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
it ſelf was here: and that it had been ſo adjudged in
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Holland's caſe,</hi> and in <hi>Dawkes &amp; Batter's caſe:</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62849:21"/>
though my Lord Chief Baron, being then at the Bar, urged
ſtrongly, that it was but the tenour of the Record that was
ſent hither. And it is a <hi>Maxim</hi> in Law, that if a Record be
here once, it never goes out again; for that here it is <hi>coram
ipſo Rege:</hi> ſo that if we do not give Iudgment here, there
will be a failer of Iuſtice, becauſe we cannot ſend the Record
back. The Iury that tries the Iſſue muſt aſſeſs the damages
upon the demurrer. The Record muſt not be ſplit in this caſe.

find a ſpecial Verdict, <hi>viz.</hi> that one <hi>Talbot</hi> recovered
in an Action of Debt againſt one <hi>Wimb,</hi> and had a <hi>Fierr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi>
directed to the Sheriff of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> whereupon he took the
Goods into his poſſeſſion, and that being in his poſſeſſion, the
Defendant took them away, and converted them, &amp;c. and the
ſole point was, whether the poſſeſſion which the Sheriff has of
Goods by him levied upon an Execution, is ſufficient to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to bring an <hi>Action of Trover? Winnington.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Action does not lie. An Action of <hi>Trover</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi>
is an Action in the right, and two things are to be
proved in it, <hi>viz.</hi> a Property in the Plaintiff, and a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in the Defendant. I confeſs that in ſome caſes, though
the Plaintiff have not the abſolute property of the Goods,
yet as to the Defendants being a wrong-doer, he may have a
ſufficient property to maintain the Action againſt him. But
I hold, that in this caſe the property is not at all altered by
the ſeizure of the Goods upon a <hi>Fieri facias, (for that he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Dyer, 98, 99. &amp; Yelvert. 44.)</hi> This caſe is ſomething
like that of Commiſſioners of Bankrupts: they have power
to ſell, and grant, and aſſign: but they cannot bring an
Action: their Aſſignees muſt bring all Actions. It is true, a
Sheriff in this caſe may bring an Action of <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> becauſe
he has poſſeſſion: but <hi>Trover</hi> is grounded upon the right, and
there muſt be a Property in the Plaintiff to ſupport that:
whereas the Sheriff takes the Goods by vertue of a <hi>nude Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi>
As when a man deviſeth, that his Executors ſhall
ſell his Land, they have but a <hi>nude Authority. Cur.</hi> The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62849:21"/>
Sheriff may well have an Action of <hi>Trover</hi> in this caſe. As
for the caſe in <hi>Yelvert.</hi> 44. there the Sheriff ſeiz'd upon a <hi>Fieri
facias:</hi> then his Office determined: then he ſold the Goods,
and the Defendant brought <hi>Trover.</hi> And it was holden, that
the Property was in the Defendant, by reaſon of the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of the Sheriffs Office: and becauſe a new <hi>Fieri facias</hi>
muſt be taken out, for that a <hi>venditioni exponas</hi> cannot iſſue
to the new Sheriff. They compared this caſe to that of a
<hi>Carryer;</hi> who is accountable for the Goods that he receives,
and may have <hi>Trover</hi> or <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> at his Election. <hi>Twiſden</hi>
ſaid, the Commiſſioners of Bankrupts might have an Action
of Trover, if they did actually ſeize any Goods of the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts,
as they might by Law. <hi>Rainsford</hi> ſaid, let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
after the ſeizure of Goods upon an Execution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Defendant, or be transferred to the Plaintiff,
ſince the Sheriff is anſwerable for them, and comes to the
poſſeſſion of them by the Law, it is reaſonable that he ſhould
have as ample remedy to recover damages for the taking of
them from him, as a Carryer has, that comes to the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Goods by the delivery of the party. <hi>Morton</hi> ſaid,
if Goods are taken into the cuſtody of a Sheriff, and the
Defendant afterward become Bankrupt, the Statute of
Bankrupts ſhall not reach them: which proves the Property
not to be in the Defendant. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> I know it hath been
urged ſeveral times at the Aſſizes, that a Sheriff ought to
have <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> and not <hi>Trover,</hi> and Counſel have preſſed hard
for a ſpecial Verdict. <hi>Morton, My Lord Chief Juſtice Bramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>

The Declaration ſays further, whereby her Husband did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an evil Opinion of her, and refuſed to cohabit with her.
But the Iury not having found any ſuch ſpecial damage, the
queſtion is, whether the words in themſelves are Actionable,
without any relation had to the damage alledged. I confeſs,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62849:22"/>
that to call one <hi>Bawd</hi> is not Actionable: for that is a term
of reproach uſed in Scolding, and does not imply any act,
whereof the Temporal Courts take notice: for one may be
ſaid to be a <hi>Bawd</hi> to her ſelf. But where one is ſaid to be a
Bawd in ſuch actions as theſe, it is actionable: 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 14.
If one ſay, that another holds Bawdry, it is Actionable:
1 <hi>Cro. 329. Thou keepeſt a Whore in thy Houſe to pull out
my Throat:</hi> theſe words have been adjudged to be Actionable:
for that they expreſs an act done; and ſo are ſpecial, and not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
railing words. In <hi>Dimock's caſe 1 Cro.</hi> 393. Two Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
were of Opinion, that the word <hi>Pimp</hi> was Actionable of
it ſelf. But I do not relie upon that, or the word <hi>Bawd;</hi> but
taking the words all together, they explain one another: the
latter words ſhow the meaning of the former; <hi>viz.</hi> that her
Pimping and Bawdry conſiſted in bringing young men and
women together, and what ſhe brought them together for, is
ſufficiently expreſſed in the words <hi>Pimp</hi> and <hi>Bawd; viz.</hi> that
ſhe brought them together to be naught. And that is ſuch a
Slander, as if it be true, ſhe may be indicted for it, and is
puniſhable at the Common Law. The Court was of the
ſame Opinion: and gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff.

by them, or any other perſon or perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
and alledge, that a Stranger claiming a Title, did
make an Entry upon them, and kept them out of poſſeſſion.
To this the Defendants plead a local Plea: to wit, that the
ſaid Stranger did not enter upon the Plaintiffs, &amp;c. upon
which Iſſue is joyned. Then do the Plaintiffs make a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,
and pray a <hi>Venire facias</hi> into the next County. Vpon
which there is a Trial. <hi>Jones</hi> conceived this to be a miſ-trial,
and that the <hi>Venire</hi> ought to have been <hi>de vicineto</hi> of the
Caſtle of <hi>York,</hi> where the Covenant is alledged to have béen
made: Firſt, this fault is not aided by any of the Statutes
of <hi>Jeoffayles:</hi> not by the laſt and greateſt of all. That aids
where the <hi>Venire facias</hi> is awarded from another place then it
ought to be, but not when awarded from another County;
which is my Exception. That at the Common Law this <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire
facias</hi> is not well awarded, I relie upon <hi>Dowdale's caſe
6 Rep.</hi> if an Action be brought upon a matter done out of
the Kingdom, the Trial ſhall be where the Action is laid. In
our caſe the Action is grounded upon an Indenture, ſuppoſed
to be made within the County of <hi>York:</hi> but Iſſue is joyned
upon a matter done out of the Kingdom; for ſo <hi>Berwick</hi> is.
This Iſſue, I conceive, ought to be tryed where the Action
is laid. It is true in the caſe of <hi>Wales,</hi> the Law is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:
for I find, that <hi>Wales</hi> is parcel of the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
though the Kings Writs do not run there. But <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
is part of the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was conquered
by <hi>King Edw.</hi> 4. and Acts of Parliament name <hi>Berwick.</hi>
When <hi>Calice</hi> was in poſſeſſion of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and
a matter ariſing within <hi>Calice</hi> came in Iſſue, was ever any
<hi>Venire facias</hi> awarded to <hi>Dover? Twiſd.</hi> There are two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
of ſuch Trials: one in 12 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 630. and in
2 <hi>Rolls</hi> 97. I have asked my Brother <hi>Withrington,</hi> who was
a knowing man, how it came to paſs that <hi>Berwick</hi> was put
into Acts of Parliament? he ſaid, he knew no other reaſon
then that the Recorder of <hi>Berwick</hi> was at firſt in Parliament,
and deſired it, and therefore it hath continued ever ſince. <hi>Mr.
Weſton</hi> ſaid, that 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 465. was an Authority. In this
caſe it hapned, that during the <hi>Cur. adviſare vult,</hi> one of the
Plaintiffs dyed: and the queſtion was, what ſhould be done?
<hi>Twiſd.</hi> There is a caſe in <hi>Latch,</hi> wherein this difference is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<hi>viz.</hi> If there be no Continuance entred, you may enter
the Iudgment as at the day in Bank: but if Continuances
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62849:25"/>
are entred, then you cannot go back, but muſt enter the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the time of the Continuances. It was put off for

                  <p>IN this caſe Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> was about to argue, that
the reſidue of the term was not forfeited to the King.
<hi>Keel.</hi> Brother <hi>Maynard,</hi> you would do well to be adviſed,
whether or no you, being of the Kings Counſel, ought to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
in this caſe againſt the King? <hi>Maynard</hi> anſwered, that
the Kings Counſel would have but little to do, if they ſhould
be excluded in ſuch caſes: and that Serjeant <hi>Crew</hi> argued
<hi>Haviland's caſe,</hi> in which there was the like queſtion. <hi>Twiſd.</hi>
In <hi>Stone &amp; Newman's caſe,</hi> I know the Kings Counſel did
argue againſt Eſtates coming to the Crown: but if my Lord
thinks it not proper, my Brother <hi>Maynard</hi> may give his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to ſome Gentleman at the Bar to deliver for him.
Afterward <hi>Term. Paſch. 22 Car.</hi> 2. 1670. the caſe came to be
argued again. <hi>Jones</hi> argued for the Plaintiff in the Writ of
Error: 1. Whether this Settlement be fraudulent or no?
that Fraud is not to be preſumed, he cited the <hi>Chancellor</hi> of
<hi>Oxford's caſe, 10th Rep. &amp; 1 Cro.</hi> 549, 550. But for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
point, he held that here is a Truſt forfeitable to the King.
He quoted Sir <hi>John Duncomb's caſe: 2 Cro.</hi> That the Truſt
in this caſe is forfeited, he proved from the nature of a Truſt,
which is an equitable Intereſt, or a right of perception of the
profits of an Eſtate: the <hi>ceſtuy que Truſt,</hi> hath <hi>jus habendi
&amp; jus diſponendi.</hi> And though he that hath a Truſt, hath in
Law neither <hi>jus in re,</hi> nor <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> yet in Equity he hath
both: In Equity whatever I have a right to diſpoſe of, I
have a right to take the profits of. For if a man makes a
Conveyance to the uſe of one and his heirs, in Truſt that he
ſhall convey over, though it is not expreſt that he ſhall take
the profits, yet he ſhall take them. Now in the ſecond <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi>
there is a double expreſſion, one that amounts to a Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
the other amounting to a diſpoſition or limitation.
Now he that hath a power of diſpoſition, hath a right that
may be forfeited. And therefore the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk's caſe</hi>
comes not to this, for we are not in the power of Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62849:25"/>
I decline that, but we are in a power of diſpoſition.
Now this is good by way of Truſt: in Law indéed ſuch a
<hi>Proviſo</hi> is naught, but in a Truſt the intention of the parties
carries it. I obſerve in forfeitures at the Common Law,
where a man hath only <hi>jus diſponendi,</hi> though he hath no
Eſtate, yet he may forfeit it: <hi>Plo. Com.</hi> 260. A man is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of a term in the right of his wife, though he hath no
Eſtate himſelf, yet he may forfeit it: and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath <hi>jus diſponendi.</hi> If a man might by ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
as this protect his Eſtate from being forfeited, little
Land would come to the Crown upon <hi>Attainders.</hi> There
are two badges of Ownerſhip: the one is a perception of the
profits, the other a power of diſpoſing: both which are in our
caſe: and a favourable conſtruction ought not to be put upon
a Déed for encouragement of Traitors. <hi>Winnington contra.</hi>
As for the firſt point, the Fraud ought to be found: and this
Leaſe was made long before the Attainder, or the Treaſon
committed. For the ſecond point, the queſtion will be, what
our Law calls a Truſt? Then I ſhall examine whether
there was ſuch a thing in <hi>Mayn</hi> at the time of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe?
A Truſt I find to be a confidence repoſed in the perſon,
that another ſhall take the profits, and that the Truſtée ſhall
Convey according to his directions: this I gather from theſe
books, <hi>viz. Plowd. 352. Delamere's caſe. 1 Rep. 121, 122.
Co. Lit.</hi> 272. Now if theſe two qualities, or either, ſhall fall
in this caſe, then <hi>Simon Mayn</hi> had no Truſt to forfeit: For
that, the caſe will depend upon the true-ſtating the words of
the Deed. For the firſt <hi>Proviſo,</hi> it doth not cohere with any
of theſe qualities: for by vertue of that <hi>Proviſo</hi> he could not
be ſaid to have any Right: he hath no <hi>jus diſponendi,</hi> but
upon Contingencies. If he have no Children, he hath no
ſuch power; nay, if he have Children, they muſt be living at
his death. Further, by theſe Proviſoes, if the Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
do happen, he hath but a power to declare the Vſes; he
hath no Intereſt in him at all: <hi>Litt. Sect.</hi> 463. It is one
thing to have a power or poſſibility of limiting an Intereſt,
another to have an Intereſt veſted: 7 <hi>Rep. 11. &amp; Moor's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
366.</hi> about the delivery of a Ring; where they hold,
that if it had been to have been done with his own hand, it had
not been forfeited. The caſe of <hi>Sir Edward Clere</hi> is different
from ours: for if a man make a feoffment to the uſe of his
laſt Will, or to the uſe of ſuch perſons as ſhall be appointed by his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62849:26"/>
laſt Will; in this caſe he remains a perfect owner of the Land.
But if a man makes a Conveyance with power to make
Leaſes, or to make an Eſtate to pay Debts, he hath here no
Intereſt, but a naked power. The <hi>Duke of Norfolk's caſe</hi>
is full in the point: A Conveyance to the uſe of himſelf for
life, the Remainder to his Son in Tail, with power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
under Hand and Seal: adjudged not forfeited: and yet
he had a power to declare his mind, as in our caſe. <hi>Pagett's
caſe, Moor 193, 194. Keeling.</hi> If this way be taken, a man
may commit Treaſon pretty cheaply. <hi>Twiſden.</hi> Whoever
hath a power of Revocation, hath a power of Limitation.
The reaſon is, becauſe elſe the feoffées would be ſeized to their
own Vſe. <hi>Sir William Shelly's caſe in Latch. Twiſden.</hi> There
is no difference betwixt the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk's caſe</hi> and this;
only here it is under his hand writing, and there under his
proper hand writing.</p>
                  <p>Afterward <hi>Term. Paſch. 23 Car.</hi> 2. 1671. the Court deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their Opinions <hi>(Hales</hi> being then Chief Iuſtice.)
<hi>Morton.</hi> I conceive the Iudgment in the Common-Pleas is
well given: As for the firſt point, whether this Conveyance
made by <hi>Sir Simon Mayn</hi> be fraudulent or not, the Counſel
themſelves have declined it; and therefore I ſhall ſay nothing
to it: For the ſecond, I conceive no larger Intereſt is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
then during the Life of the Father. If it be objected,
that the Father had by this Proviſo <hi>jus diſponendi;</hi> I anſwer,
it is true, he had a power, if he had been minded ſo to do,
but it was not his mind and Will: Now <hi>animus hominis
eſt ipſe homo;</hi> but he muſt not only be minded ſo to do,
but he muſt declare his pleaſure. <hi>Hobart</hi> ſaith, if a man will
create a power to himſelf, and impoſe a Condition or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
for the Execution of it, it muſt be obſerved. Now
here is a perſonal and individual power, ſeated in the heart
of a man. And it ſeems to me a ſtronger caſe then that of
the <hi>Duke of Norfolk,</hi> put in <hi>Englefield's caſe,</hi> where yet the
Condition was not given to the King by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.
There was a later caſe adjudged in <hi>Latch,</hi> betwéen <hi>Warner</hi>
and <hi>Hynde:</hi> a caſe that walked through all the Courts in
<hi>Weſtminſter-hall:</hi> there by reaſon of the <hi>ipſo declarante,</hi> it
could not be forfeited. <hi>Rainsford.</hi> I hold it is not forfeited.
My reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is at an end and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for when he dyed and made no Will, there's an end of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62849:26"/>
                     <hi>Proviſo.</hi> The altering of the old Truſt is to be done by Sir
<hi>Simon Mayn,</hi> and it is inſeparable from his perſon: nothing
can be more inſeparable then a mans Will. <hi>Moor 193.
Twiſd.</hi> I am of the ſame Opinion. <hi>Hales</hi> was of the ſame
Opinion: that nothing was forfeited but during Sir <hi>Simon's</hi>
life. The <hi>Proviſo,</hi> he ſaid, did not create a Truſt, but <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem
diſponendi,</hi> which is not a Truſt. He ſaid he did not
underſtand the difference betwéen the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk's</hi> caſe
and this. Accordingly the Iudgment was affirm'd.</p>
                  <p>In a cauſe wherein one <hi>Aſton</hi> was Attorney, <hi>Keeling</hi> ſaid,
That a man may diſcontinue his Action here before an Action
brought in the <hi>Common-Pleas:</hi> But if he do begin there, and
then they plead another Action depending here, and then they
diſcontinue, I take it the Attorney ought to be committed for
this practice. <hi>Twiſden.</hi> When I was at the Bar, Error was
brought, and Infancy aſſigned, when the Man was thirty years
old: and the Attorney was threatned to be turned out of the
Roll.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Newdigate</hi> moved for a <hi>Certiorari</hi> to remove an

for Robbery. <hi>Keeling.</hi> Will it remove the Recogniſances
there to appear? <hi>Twiſden.</hi> I never knew ſuch a motion
made by any but the King's Attorney or Solicitor. <hi>Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
There is no Indictment yet before a Iudge of Aſſiſe.
<hi>Keeling.</hi> You may have a <hi>Certiorari;</hi> but it muſt not be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

in conſideration that the Plaintiff <hi>mitteret proſequi

Plaintiff, it was moved in Arreſt of Iudgment, that here is
not any conſideration: for there is no loſs to the Plaintiff in
ſending to proſecute, &amp;c. nor any benefit, but a diſadvantage
to the party that owed the money: beſides, there is an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

underſtood two, and ſo there are Twenty in all. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that it does not appear how many of each, I anſwer
the words, ten pair, ſhall go to both. Beſides, it is after a

Suits, then without queſtion it had béen well enough: now
why may not a pair be underſtood of Sets or Suits, or ſo
many as will ſerve for a bed, if it ſhall not be taken for a
couple? They quoted ſome caſes in which it had béen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,

is an Infant, and appears by his Guardian: but there is a

is admitted in the Record <hi>ad ſequendum.</hi> The ſecond Error
is in the appearance: which is entred in this manner; <hi>ſc. qui

admittance) <hi>ut Gardianus ipſius Thomae in propria perſona ſua

which is the act of the Defendant: and further, it is
ſaid that the Guardian appears in <hi>propria perſona,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be. Now I conceive that the Aſſignment of the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
and the appearance of the Guardian, is triable by the
Record: and if the Infant ſhould bring an Action againſt his
Guardian, he muſt declare that he was admitted to appear
and defend his right. Now whether will this admittance <hi>ad
ſequendum,</hi> warrant ſuch a Declaration? I conceive it will
not, and that therefore the Recovery is erroneous. <hi>Winning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
I am for them that claim under the Recovery. And I
conceive this whole Record is not only good in ſubſtance, but
according to the form uſed in all common Recoveries. If an

or Vouchée, he ſhall be bound, as well as one of full age.

In our caſe there is a common Recovery, wherein the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is an Infant, who ought to appear by his Guardian:
whether the admittance of him here by his Guardian, be well
entred or no, is the queſtion: the word <hi>ſequi</hi> ſignifies only to
follow the cauſe; and the Defendant doth proſecute and act;
a <hi>Venire</hi> by <hi>Proviſo</hi> may be taken out at the Defendants
Suit: 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 7. ſo in a Replevin the Defendant is the
proſecutor: and the Tenant doth ſue in common Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and is the only perſon that doth proſecute and act; ſo
that I think the word is proper. It is true, one book is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
where <hi>proſequendum</hi> is void in an <hi>Ejectment: 2 Cro. 640,
641. Sympſon's caſe,</hi> but that Iudgment is upon the point of
<hi>prochein amy.</hi> There is a Preſident for me in 6 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. which
I believe, was the preſident of this caſe. And <hi>Sir Francis En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glefield's
caſe</hi> where the Infant came in as Vouchée, is the
ſame with ours. As for the ſecond Error aſſigned, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the Guardian is ſaid to come in <hi>propria perſona;</hi> In the Earl
of <hi>Newport's</hi> Caſe and in <hi>Englefield's</hi> Caſe <hi>propria perſona</hi> is
in the ſame manner as here. Now the Law doth not regard
ſo much the manner of the admittance, as that a good
Guardian be admitted. <hi>Twiſden.</hi> This is a Recovery ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
upon a Privy Seal from the King, and upon a marriage
ſettlement, upon good conſideration; and therefore ought to
be favoured. The word <hi>ſequatur</hi> is as proper for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
as for the Plaintiff. And for the ſecond, the words <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria
perſona</hi> are well enough, being applyed to the Guardian,
who does in proper perſon appear for the Infant. For an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
to ſuffer a common Recovery, if it were <hi>res integra,</hi>
it would hardly be admitted. But if an Infant will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
a common Recovery, he ought to do it whileſt he
is under age, as it was adjudged here about two years
ago, according to my Lord <hi>Coke's</hi> Opinion. <hi>Weſton.</hi> If you
ſtand upon that, whether an Infant having ſuffered a common

to <hi>Nicholas Love</hi> the Father, if he ſhould ſo long live; that

to <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Son for his life, and if <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Son
ſhould dye without Iſſue of his body begotten, then he devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them to <hi>Barnaby</hi> the Plaintiff. Then they find that the
Wife was Executrix, and that ſhe did agree to this Deviſe.
And whether this be a good Limitation to <hi>Barnaby</hi> or not, is
the queſtion. <hi>Jones.</hi> I conceive it is a good Limitation to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62849:31"/>
                     <hi>Barnaby.</hi> I ſhall enquire whether a Termor having deviſed
to one for life, and after his death to another for life, may go
any further: And ſecondly, admitting that he may go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether the Limitation in our caſe, which is to begin
after the death of the ſecond, without Iſſue of his body, be
good or no? For the firſt point, he ſaid the reaſon given in
<hi>Plo. Com. 519. &amp; in 8. Co.</hi> 94. why an Executory Deviſe of
a term is good in Law, is becauſe the Law takes it as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to the laſt man firſt, and then afterwards to the firſt
man; without which tranſpoſition it is not good: for if it
ſhould be a Deviſe to the firſt man firſt, there would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left for the laſt but a poſſibility, which is not grantable
over. Now then, if a man may deviſe a term after the death
of another, then he may deviſe it after the death of two
other. It is true, this cannot be in Grants, for they are
founded upon Contracts, and there muſt be a certainty in
them: according to the Rector of <hi>Chedington's caſe.</hi> Now
if a Deviſe may be good after the death of one or two, it is
all one if it be limited after the death of five or ſix. Now
that a contingency may be deviſed upon a Contingency, I
take it, that the Authorities are clear: 14 <hi>Car. 1. Cotton &amp;
Herle: 1 Roll</hi> 612. reſolved by three Iuſtices. <hi>Et Hill. 9 Jac.
Rot. 889. 2 Cr.</hi> 461. And for the caſe of <hi>Child</hi> and <hi>Bayly,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in 2 <hi>Cro.</hi> 459. and in <hi>Roll</hi> 613. I conceive it is not
againſt our caſe; for they held the Deviſe to be void, not
becauſe it was a Contingency upon a Contingency, but in
reſpect of the remoteneſs of the poſſibility, and becauſe the
term was wholly deviſed to a man and his Aſſigns. So that
by the expreſs Authority of the two firſt caſes, and by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of this caſe, I do think that a Deviſe to a man
after ſuch a manner is good, provided that it do not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a perpetuity: ſo that where there is not the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of a perpetuity, though there are many Contingencies,
they are no impediment to the Deviſe. Therefore where a
Deviſe is upon a Contingency that may happen upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration
of one or more mens lives, and where it is upon a
Contingency that may endure for ever, there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
The reaſon of the <hi>Rector of Chedington's caſe</hi> was,
becauſe of the uncertainty; for in caſe of a grant of a term,
there is a great uncertainty; but ours is in caſe of a Deviſe;
which is not taken in the Law by way of remainder: 12
<hi>Aſſ.</hi> 5. ſo that I conceive a Contingency may be limited
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62849:32"/>
upon a Contingency, provided that it be not remote. The
ſecond point is, whether this Deviſe (thus limited) be
a good Deviſe? Now I conceive the limitation is as
good, as if it had been to his Wife for her life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her death to <hi>Nicholas</hi> for life, and after his death to
<hi>Barnaby.</hi> I agree, that if theſe words (if <hi>Nicholas</hi> dye
without heirs of his body) ſhall not be applied to the
time of his death, it will be a void Deviſe. But the
meaning is, That if at the time of his death he ſhall
have no Iſſue, then, &amp;c. Now that they muſt have ſuch
conſtruction, I prove from the words of the Will. The
limitation of the Remainder muſt be taken ſo as to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate
with the particular Eſtate. As if there be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
to one for life, and if he dye without Iſſue, to
another, this is a good Remainder upon Condition, and
the Remainder ſhall reſt upon the determination of the
particular Eſtate, if the Tenant for life have no Iſſue
when he dyeth; but if a Man Convey to one, and the heirs
of his body, and if he dye without Iſſue, to another,
there it muſt be underſtood of a failer of Iſſue at any
time; becauſe the precedent limitation goes further then
his life. But admitting there were no precedent words
to guide the intention, and that common parlance were
againſt me, yet if there be but a poſſibility of a good
conſtruction, it ſhall be ſo conſtrued: and they may very
well be underſtood of his dying without Iſſue of his body
at the time of his death. In <hi>Goodyer &amp; Clerk's caſe</hi> in
this Court: <hi>Trin. 12 Car. Rot.</hi> 1048. I confeſs it was
adjudged, that it ſhould be underſtood of a failer of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
at any time; but in our caſe, if you ſhall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it of a failer of Iſſue at the time of his death,
it cannot have any conſtruction at all to take effect. I
think there are no expreſs Authorities againſt me: thoſe
that may ſeem to be ſo, I will put, and endeavour to
give an anſwer to them: As for <hi>Child &amp; Baylie's caſe,</hi>
Reports differ upon the reaſon of that Iudgment: For
<hi>Cro.</hi> ſays, it was held to be a void Deviſe, becauſe it
was taken, if he dye without Iſſue at any time during
the term: But Sergeant <hi>Rolls</hi> goes upon another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
<hi>Rolls</hi> 613. there he ſays it is void, becauſe given
abſolutely to the Son and his Aſſigns before. In <hi>Rolls
firſt part, 611. Leventhorp &amp; Aſhly's caſe,</hi> the Remainder
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62849:32"/>
there is ſaid to be void, becauſe when he had deviſed the
term to <hi>A.</hi> and the Heirs Males of his body, it ſhall go
to the Executors of <hi>A.</hi> and the Remainder there was to
begin upon his dying without Iſſue at any time. The
caſe of <hi>Saunders and Corniſh</hi> will not come to ours: for
there were many limitations for life ſucceſſively to perſons
not in being, &amp;c. In the caſe cited <hi>1ſt Report,</hi> 135. of an
Eſtate for life limited to one, and to every heir ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,
an Eſtate for life, the limitation was naught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it would make a perpetual Free-hold: and no body
would know where the abſolute Eſtate ſhould veſt. So
he prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff. <hi>Coleman</hi> for the
Defendant. I conceive this to be a void limitation.
Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> would make this a middle caſe. I ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
him of the firſt point, though he has taken pains
to argue it: and I ſhall reſt upon this, That the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a term after the death of a man, without Iſſue
of his body, is void. The caſe is put as a middle caſe
to theſe two; <hi>viz.</hi> If a man poſſeſſed of a Leaſe for
years, Deviſe it to <hi>I. S.</hi> for life, the Remainder to <hi>J. N.</hi>
for life, the Remainder to <hi>J. G.</hi> for life; theſe Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are good. But if he do Deviſe to <hi>J. S.</hi> and the
Heirs of his body, the Remainder over; this Remainder
he admits to be void, becauſe it depends upon ſo remote
a poſſibility as may never happen. Now I conceive it
is the ſame thing to limit it to one for life, and if he
dye without Iſſue, then to another for life, as to limit
it to one and the Heirs of his body, with a Remainder
over. He would tye it up from the ordinary and Legal
Conſtruction, to iſſue at the time of his death. If it be
to be underſtood of dying without Iſſue at any time,
then <hi>Child &amp; Baylie's caſe,</hi> and <hi>Corniſhe's caſe,</hi> are full
Authorities in the point. <hi>Vide 2 Cro. 459. Rolls, 612,
614.</hi> There Leſſée for years deviſeth to one for life, and
after to <hi>Wms.</hi> and his Aſſigns, and if he dye without
Iſſue <hi>then living,</hi> the Remainder to <hi>I. G.</hi> This they
ſay is good in caſe of a Fée-ſimple, but they will not
allow it in caſe of a term for years. Now <hi>Mr. Jones</hi>
would by Conſtruction bring the words <hi>then living,</hi> into
our caſe. The Legal Conſtruction of the words, <hi>dying
without Iſſue,</hi> is, if there be a failer of Iſſue at any time
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62849:33"/>
to come. In <hi>Pell &amp; Brown's caſe,</hi> if the words <hi>then
living</hi> had not been in the Will, the caſe had not béen
ſo adjudged. <hi>Keeling.</hi> You go up Hill a little. Can
<hi>Barnaby</hi> take ſo long, as there is any Iſſue in being
of <hi>Nicholas? Jones.</hi> He cannot. <hi>Keeling.</hi> Then <hi>Barnaby's</hi>
Intereſt depends upon a Contingency, that may never
happen. <hi>Jones.</hi> I grant, if <hi>Nicholas</hi> hath Iſſue at the
time of his death, that <hi>Barnaby</hi> ſhall never take, but if
he hath none, he ſhall. <hi>Keeling.</hi> If I Deviſe Lands to
<hi>A.</hi> for life, and if he dye without Iſſue of his body, to
<hi>B. A.</hi> ſhall have an Eſtate Tail. So in our caſe, the
words and limitation is the ſame, though, the Deviſor
having but a Leaſe for years, there cannot be an Eſtate
Tail of it: yet he intended not that <hi>Barnaby</hi> ſhould have
any Eſtate as long as there were any Iſſue in being of
<hi>Nicholas</hi> his body. <hi>Twiſden.</hi> It appears to me upon the
reaſon of the caſes that have been cited, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to <hi>Barnaby</hi> muſt be void, becauſe of the remote
poſſibility: But then there will be a queſtion, to whom
the Remainder of the term will go, if <hi>Nicholas</hi> dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Iſſue? whether to the Executors of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> or to
the Executors of <hi>Doctor Love?</hi> If <hi>A.</hi> Tenant for life
of a term, Deviſe it to <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder to
<hi>C.</hi> for life, the Remainder to <hi>D.</hi> for life; I have heard
it queſtioned, whether theſe Remainders are good or not?
But it hath been held, that if all the Remainder-men
are living at the time of the Deviſe, it is good: if all
the Candles be light at once, good. But if you limit
a Remainder to a perſon not in being, as to the firſt
begotten Son, &amp;c. and the like, there would be no end
if ſuch limitations were admitted, and therefore they are
void. And ſome Iudges are of the ſame Opinion to this
hour. If I Deviſe a term to <hi>A.</hi> for life; after the
death of <hi>A.</hi> his Executors ſhall not have it, but it ſhall
go to the Executors of the Deviſor: But if it be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to <hi>A.</hi> generally, without ſaying <hi>for life,</hi> it ſhall go
to his Executors after his death. But a Deviſe for life
veſts in him only during his life, and you may make a
limitation over. <hi>Keeling.</hi> I take it, that <hi>A.</hi> carries the
whole term, when deviſed to him for life: becauſe an
Eſtate for life is larger then the longeſt term. <hi>Twiſden.</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62849:33"/>

                  <p>AN Action upon the Caſe againſt a Sheriff for making

<hi>Wright</hi> was endebted to him in 60 <hi>l.</hi> and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to pay him, and that thereupon a Writ was
ſued out againſt him directed to the Defendant, being Sheriff
of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> who took him into his cuſtody, and after ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to go at large, whither he would, and at the day of
Return, he returned that he had his body ready. <hi>Jones.</hi> They
have demurred to the Declaration: which I conceive to be a
good Declaration. For take the caſe, that there went a <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titat</hi>
to the Sheriff, and the Sheriff took the perſon upon it,
and let him go at large, no body will deny, but that an
Action of Eſcape will lye againſt him: and when he makes
ſuch a falſe Return, as here, that he has the body ready,
why will not an Action lie for a falſe Return? and this is no
new caſe, but hath béen adjudged <hi>Moor. plac. 596. 3 Cro. 460.
ibid.</hi> 624. it is at the Plaintiffs Election to follow the Sheriff
with Amercements, or to bring his Action for the falſe Return.
And when this Action has been brought formerly, they were
forced to plead the Statute; none ever demurred generally.
<hi>Twiſden.</hi> I remember a caſe in 21 <hi>Car. 1. Rot.</hi> 616. betwéen
<hi>Franklyn &amp; Andrews,</hi> where an Action upon the Caſe was
brought againſt a Sheriff for ſuch a falſe Return: he pleaded
the Statute, and they held in that caſe, that the Sheriff could
not Return any thing elſe but <hi>Cepi corpus.</hi> And old <hi>Hodſon,</hi>
that ſate here, remembred the caſe of <hi>Langton &amp; Gardiner</hi>
reported in 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> and ſaid, the Court did amerce the Sheriff
for a bad Return; but the Iudgment was given in that caſe
for the Plaintiff, becauſe there was a Traverſe <hi>aliter vel alio
modo,</hi> which could not be, unleſs a falſe Return had been
confeſſed, and the Court ordered Iudgment to be entred for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62849:35"/>
the Plaintiff for that cauſe. In the caſe of <hi>Franklyn,</hi> the
Court held, that upon Iſſue <hi>Not-guilty,</hi> the Statute might
be given in Evidence: but upon a Demurrer you ought to
plead the Statute, and the general Demurrer cannot be help'd
in this caſe, unleſs you will ſay that it is a general Law.
<hi>Whelpdale's</hi> caſe is, that the Statute muſt be pleaded, becauſe
it is a particular Law: but it concerns Extortion in all She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs;
and the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> that concerns all Parſons,
touching Non-reſidency, is held to be a general Law: and it
is not to be ſtirr'd now; but if the point were to be adjudged
again, perhaps we might be of another Opinion. <hi>Keeling.</hi>
They have relyed here upon the falſe Return, and the general
Demurrer I take to be well enough. <hi>Morton &amp; Rainsford</hi>
accorded; wherefore Iudgment was given againſt the

                  <p>AN Action upon the Statute of <hi>Praemunire</hi> for impeaching
in the Chancery a Iudgment given in the Kings-Bench.
The Defendant demurred. <hi>Bigland</hi> for the Defendant. The
queſtion is, whether the Court of Chancery be meant within
the Statute of 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 3. This queſtion has béen contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
formerly, but has not béen ſtirr'd within theſe 40 years
laſt paſt. It concerns the Chancery, as it is a Court of
Equity. Now the Statute cannot be applyed to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery
as ſuch; for it was not a Court of Equity at that time;
and if ſo, then muſt the Statute be applyed to other Courts,
where the <hi>gravamen</hi> then was. <hi>Mr. Lambert</hi> in his Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Courts, ſays of this Court, that the King did at firſt
determine Cauſes in Equity in perſon: and that about 20
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3 the King going beyond Sea, delegated this power to
the Chancellor. And then he ſays, ſeveral Statutes were
made to enlarge the Iurisdiction of this Court, as 17 <hi>Rich. 2.
cap. 6. &amp;c.</hi> But the Chancellor took not upon him <hi>ex Officio,</hi>
to determine matters in Equity, till <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's time.
For till then it was done by the King in perſon, or he delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
whom he pleaſed. So that the <hi>Gravamen</hi> of that Statute
could not be in the Chancery. 2. It is not poſſible that the
King can be diſinherited in his own Courts: and therefore
the Statute muſt be underſtood of Courts, that ſtand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the Kings Courts, and only forreign Courts.
But this Court is held by the Kings Seal, and the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in it are according to the Kings Conſcience. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It is ſaid in the Statute, that the Offenders <hi>ſhall have
a day given them to appear before the King and his Council, or
in his Chancery, &amp;c.</hi> and it is ſtrange that the Chancery
ſhould give the remedy, if that were one of the Courts
wherein the Offence were incurred. My fourth reaſon is from
the penalty: the penalty is very rare and great: for they
muſt be put out of the Kings Protection, their Lands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,
and their bodies impriſon'd at the Kings pleaſure. The
penalty is fitted well for thoſe that draw the Kings Subjects
out of the Kings Iurisdiction: but ſo great a penalty to be
inflicted for ſuing in the Kings Courts, is not ſo reaſonable.
If a man ſue in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for a matter Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62849:36"/>
ſhall he incur a <hi>Premunire?</hi> An Action upon the Caſe
may lye, when a man is miſtaken in the Court, in which he
ought to ſue, but to make it a <hi>Praemunire</hi> ſeems not ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.
The Vſurpations of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> were the
cauſe of the making of this Statute, and all other Statutes
of <hi>Praemunire: 28 Ed. 3. cap. 1. 16 H. 6. cap.</hi> 5. the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was all along of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome's</hi> Vſurpations;
but not a word of the Chancery. <hi>Sir John Davies</hi> in his caſe
of <hi>Praemunire</hi> tells us, that all the Statutes were made upon
this occaſion. Of all the Attainders of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> there
never was one for ſuing in the Chancery. The great Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is from theſe words in the Statute, <hi>(or which do ſue in
any other Court)</hi> now, ſay they, this laſt disjunctive muſt
be applyed to this Court, and not to the Court or Courts
mentioned before. But I anſwer, there were other Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Courts within this Realm, beſides that that was a
ſtanding Court, and had a conſtant dependance upon the
Pope here; and they were aimed at by this disjunctive.
Thoſe Courts derived their Iurisdiction from the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and not from the King. There is an Authority in the
point in 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 6. Now for Authorities, I confeſs there are
great ones againſt me: 2 <hi>Cro. fol. 335. Heath &amp; Ridley. Moor.
838. Courtney verſus Glanvill.</hi> My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his
Chapter of <hi>Praemunire. 22 Ed. 4. fol.</hi> 37. But the greateſt
Authority againſt me is the caſe of <hi>Throgmorton &amp; Finch,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Pleas of the Crown,
Chapter Praemunire.</hi> But the practice has béen contrary,
not one perſon attainted of a <hi>Praemunire</hi> for that cauſe. In
King <hi>James</hi> his time the matter was referred to the Counſel,
who all agreed, that the Chancery was not meant within the
Statute: which Opinions are inrolled in Chancery. And the
King upon the report of their Reaſons, ordered the Chancellor
to proceed as he had done; and from that time to this, I do
not find that this point ever came in queſtion. And ſo he prayed
Iudgment for the Defendant. <hi>Saunders.</hi> As to that objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that at the time when this Statute was made, there
were no proceedings in Equity: I anſwer, that granting it
to be true, yet there is the ſame miſchief: The proceedings
in one part of the Chancery are <hi>coram Domino Rege in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaria,</hi>
but an Engliſh Bill is directed to the Lord Keeper,
and decreed: ſo that there is a difference in the proceedings
of the ſame Court. But admit that Courts of Equity are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62849:36"/>
the Kings Courts, yet they are <hi>aliae Curiae,</hi> if they hold plea
of matters out of their Iurisdiction. 16 <hi>Ri. 2. cap. 5. Rolls
firſt part.</hi> 381. There is a common objection, that if there
were no relief in Chancery, a man might be ruined: for the
Common Law is rigorous, and adheres ſtrictly to its rules.
I cannot anſwer this Objection better then it is anſwered to
my hand in <hi>Dr. &amp; Stud. lib. 1. cap.</hi> 18. he cited 13 <hi>Ri. 2.
num. 30. Sir Robert Cotton's Records.</hi> It is to be conſidered
what is underſtood by being impeached: Now the words of
another Act will explain that, <hi>viz. 4 H. 4. cap.</hi> 23. by that
Act it appears, that it is to draw a Iudgment in queſtion any
other way then by Writ of Error or Attaint. One would think
this Statute ſo fully penned, that there were no room for an
evaſion. There was a temporary Statute which is at large
in <hi>Raſtall 31 H. 6. cap.</hi> 2. in which there is this clauſe; <hi>viz.
That no matter determinable at Common Law, ſhall be heard
elſewhere. A fortiori,</hi> no matter determined at Common
Law ſhall be drawn in queſtion elſewhere. He cited 22 <hi>Ed. 4.
36. Sir Moyle Finch &amp; Throgmorton, 2 Inſt.</hi> 335. and <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

againſt <hi>Cardinal Woolſey</hi> in <hi>Coke's Juriſdiction of Courts,
tit. Chancery.</hi> So he prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff.
<hi>Keeling.</hi> It is fit that this cauſe be adjourned into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer-chamber,
for the Opinions of all the Iudges to be had in
it. We know what heats there were betwixt my Lord <hi>Coke

ſum of money: and then he ſets forth, that he did ſurrender
the ſaid Lands into the hands of two Tenants of the Manor
out of Court, <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem, &amp;c.</hi> Exception. The
promiſe is to ſurrender generally, which muſt be underſtood
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62849:37"/>
of a ſurrender to the Lord or to his Steward: and the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ſets forth a ſurrender to two Tenants; which is an

there are not the words <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem,</hi> as in this
caſe. <hi>Jones. Hill. 22 Car. 1. Rot.</hi> 1735. betwixt <hi>Treburn &amp;
Purchas,</hi> two points were adjudged: 1. That when there is
an agréement for a ſurrender generally, then ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſurrender is naught. 2. That the alledging of a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem</hi> is not ſufficient: but it ought to
be laid, that there was ſuch a Cuſtom within the Manor, and
then, that according to that Cuſtom he ſurrendred into, &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
is 3 <hi>Cro. 385. Coleman contra.</hi> We do ſay that we
were to ſurrender generally, and then we aver, that actually
we did ſurrender <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem:</hi> and if we had
ſaid no more, it had béen well enough. Then the adding, <hi>into
the hands of two Tenants, &amp;c.</hi> I take it that it ſhall not hurt.

my Clyent. And the reaſon of the Iudgment is in <hi>Combe's

And they compared it to this caſe: I am bound to
levy a Fine: it may be done either in Court or by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

was ſaid, that a preſcription to have Common ſo, was void in
Law; and if ſo, then a preſcription to have ſole Paſture,
which is to have the Graſs, by the mouth of the Cattle, is
no other then <hi>Common appendant: Daniel's caſe 1 Cro.</hi> ſo
that Common and Paſturage is one and the ſame thing.
They ſay that it is againſt the nature of Common, for the
very word <hi>Common</hi> ſuppoſeth that the Lord may feed. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
if that were the reaſon, then a man could not by Law
claim Common for half a year, excluding the Lord: which
may be done by Law. But the true reaſon is, that if that
were allowed, then the whole profits of the Land might be
claimed by preſcription, and ſo the whole Land be preſcribed
for. The Lord may grant to his Tenants to have Common,
excluding himſelf: but ſuch a Common is not good by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.
The ſecond point was, whether or no the preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here not being for Beaſts <hi>levant &amp; couchant,</hi> were good
or not? for that, a difference was made betwixt <hi>Common in

they are defects in the Title, appearing on Record: and that a

Common, ſuch a preſcription is not good, becauſe it is a
contradiction, but here we claim <hi>ſolam Paſturam.</hi> Now what
may be good at this day by grant, may be claimed by preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As to the Exception, that we ought to have preſcribed
for Cattle <hi>levant &amp; couchant:</hi> its true, if one doth claim
Common for Cattle, <hi>levant &amp; couchant</hi> is the meaſure for
the Common, unleſs it be for ſo many Cattle in number:
but here we claim the whole Herbage; which perhaps the
Cattle <hi>levant &amp; couchant</hi> will not eat up. <hi>Hales.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this preſcription for the ſole Paſture, yet the Soil is
the Lords, and he has Mynes, Trees, Buſhes, &amp;c. and he
may dig for Turfes. And ſuch a grant, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ſole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturage,
would be good at this day. 18 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. though a
grant by the Lord, that he will not improve, would be a void
grant at this day. <hi>Twiſden. My Lord Coke</hi> is expreſs in the
point. A man cannot preſcribe for ſole Common, but may
preſcribe for ſole Paſture. And there is no Authority
againſt him. And for <hi>levant &amp; couchant;</hi> it was adjudged
in <hi>Stoneby &amp; Muckleby's caſe,</hi> that after a Verdict it was

                  <p>HE was removed out of <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> the

for marrying a City-Orphan without the conſent of the Court

was a Citizen, or that the Marriage was within the City:
and they are not bound to take notice of a City Orphan out of
the City, for their Cuſtoms extend only to Citizens in the
City. <hi>Exception</hi> 2. They have not ſhewed that we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

<hi>Twiſden.</hi> Theſe Objections were over-ruled in one <hi>Waller's

are two matters upon which the validity of this Return doth
depend; <hi>viz.</hi> The Cuſtom and the Offence within the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.
The Cuſtom is laid, that time out of mind the Court
of Aldermen have had power to ſet a reaſonable Fine upon
ſuch as ſhould marry an Orphan without their leave, and upon
refuſal to pay it, to impriſon him. I conceive this Cuſtom,
as it is laid, to be unreaſonable: it ought to be locally cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed,
and confined to the City: 17 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 7. there was
an Action brought upon the Statute of Labourers, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
one that was the Plaintiffs retained Servant: the
Defendant pleaded in abatement, that there was no place
laid where the Plaintiffs retainer was: and this was held a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62849:46"/>
good Plea; for that if it were in another County then
where the Defendant retained him, it was impoſſible for the
Defendant to take notice of a Retainer in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
No more can we take notice who is a City Orphan
in the County of <hi>Kent.</hi> Then, they have returned a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
to impriſon generally; but it ſhould have beén, that
without reaſonable cauſe ſhewn they might impriſon, and
the party have liberty to ſhew cauſe to the contrary.
Then, I conceive they have returned the Fact as defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
as the Cuſtom: they ſay, that he marryed her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their conſent; they ought to have ſaid, that he took
her out of their cuſtody: and your Lordſhips will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that ſhe was in their cuſtody, when ſhe was out of

becauſe it was impoſſible to give notice to all, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>ex neceſſitate rei,</hi> they muſt take notice at their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.
<hi>Hales.</hi> The City has an Intereſt in the Orphan,
wherever the Orphan be. And for notice, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire;
there is no impoſſibility of his coming to the
knowledge whether ſhe be an Orphan or no; therefore if
he takes her, he takes her at his peril. <hi>Twiſden.</hi> And
for the Fine, ſuch a Fine was ſet in <hi>Langham's Caſe,</hi>
and adjudged good. Let a Citizen of <hi>London</hi> live where

a Prohibition ſhall go. There was a caſe, in which it was

was to a ſpiritual intent; and what is committed to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Power and Iurisdiction, this Court doth preſerve.
Eccleſiaſtical men hold <hi>in Eleemoſynam: Litt. Sect. 136. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62849:48"/>
de Religioſis domibus.</hi> When Colledges are founded
under rule and order, it doth give the Biſhop Iurisdiction: ſo
that this Court will not enquire into this matter, no more
than it will enquire into cauſes of Deprivation, and matters
relating to the Inſtitution of Clergy-men. It has béen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that a Fellow of a Colledge can bring an <hi>Aſſize.</hi> But
as a Prebend hath two capacities, ſole and aggregate: ſo a
Fellow is a Member of a Corporation aggregate, and hath a
ſole capacity in reſpect of his Fellowſhip. For a Church-Warden
who is admitted according to the courſe of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Law, a <hi>Mandamus</hi> will not lie: <hi>Vide 6 H. 7. 10.
Twiſden.</hi> In one <hi>Patrick's caſe,</hi> we all held that a Colledge
was a Temporal Corporation. <hi>Hales.</hi> There is a reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in <hi>Dyer</hi> why a <hi>Mandamus</hi> will not lye in the caſe there,
<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it was prayed to be awarded to a Temporal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration.
<hi>Coleman.</hi> It doth appear by the Return, that the
Founder hath appointed a Viſitor, now to him there may be
an Appeal; and we have returned the Sentence of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and need not return the cauſe of the Sentence. And for
Books, I do oppoſe <hi>Rolls, tit. Prerogative, Huntly's caſe,
209. to Specott's caſe,</hi> and <hi>Ken's caſe in the Reports.</hi> In our
caſe the party has a remedy elſewhere, and therefore he ſhall
not come hither. If a <hi>Mandamus</hi> ſhall lie for a Maſterſhip,
Fellowſhip or Schollarſhip, it will in time come to lie for turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of Commons, and what a combuſtion will this raiſe
then? The Niceties of Husband and Wife were ſaid by the
Iudges in <hi>Scott's</hi> caſe, to be proper for the Spiritual Court,
and not fit to be brought before the Iudges. <hi>Hales.</hi> That a
<hi>Mandamus</hi> lies, I will not poſitively deny; but whether is it
fit for us to proceed after this Return? It muſt be taken for
granted, that it is not a ſpiritual Corporation; if it were,
you ought to Appeal to the Viſitor, and then to the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.
It is a private Society, as an Inns of Court: and
I confeſs, that <hi>Mandamus's</hi> do generally reſpect matters of
publick concern. I never heard of a <hi>Mandamus</hi> for a Monk.
If there be a Iurisdiction in the Viſitor, and he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the matter, how will you get over that Sentence?
The Chancellor is Viſitor of all the Kings Frée-Chappels,
and the 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. doth make him ſo of all Colledges of the
Kings Foundation. Suppoſe a Temporal Court, over which
we have Iurisdiction, do give Iudgment in <hi>Aſſize</hi> to recover
an Office: ſo long as that Iudgment ſtands in force, do you
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62849:48"/>
think that we will grant a <hi>Mandamus</hi> to reſtore him againſt
whom the Iudgment is given? <hi>Twiſden.</hi> In all Eleemoſinary
things there are Viſitors appointed either by Law, or by Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the party. <hi>Hales.</hi> The Frée-Chappels of <hi>Windſor</hi>
and <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> are not of Spiritual Iurisdiction. <hi>Hales.</hi>
At this rate we ſhould examine all Deprivations, Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Elections, &amp;c. and by the 13 <hi>of the Qu.</hi> the Laws of
the Vniverſity are confirmed. <hi>Hales.</hi> We ought not to grant
a <hi>Mandamus</hi> where there is a Viſitor: but in this caſe the
Viſitor hath given Sentence.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> Trial at Bar. An Action upon the caſe was brought
againſt a Maſter of a Ship, who had taken in Goods
to Tranſport them beyond Sea, for that he ſo negligently
kept them, that they were ſtolen away whilſt the Ship lay in
the River of <hi>Thames. Maynard</hi> inſiſted upon it, that the
Maſter was not chargeable: ſay they, he is chargeable whileſt
he is here, but when he is gone out of the Realm, he is not
chargeable, though the Goods be taken from him. Which
diſtinction, he ſaid, had no foundation in Law. <hi>Hales.</hi> It
will lye upon you that are for the Defendants, to ſhew a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a Carrier and a Maſter of a Ship. And it will
lye upon you that are for the Plaintiff, to ſhew why the Maſter
of a Ship ſhould be charged for a Robbery committed within
the Realm, and not for a Pyracy committed at Sea. It
was urged for the Plaintiff, that a Hoy-man and Ferry-man
are bound to anſwer, and why not the Maſter of a Ship?
The Defendant proved that there was no careleſneſs nor neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
default in him. <hi>Maynard.</hi> He is not chargeable, if
there be no negligence in him, becauſe he is but a Servant,
the owner takes the Freight. <hi>Hales.</hi> He is <hi>Exercitor navis,</hi>
If we ſhould let looſe the Maſter, the Merchant would not be
ſecure. And if we ſhould be too quick upon him, it might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
all Maſters: ſo that the conſequence of this caſe is
great. But the Iury gave a Verdict for the Defendant; the
Court, for the reaſons aforeſaid, inclining that way.</p>

the Heirs of his body, upon condition, That if he marry
without conſent of ſuch and ſuch, or dye without Heirs of the
body of his Mother, that then the Eſtate ſhall go to another
and his Heirs. He marries without their conſent, and he in
the Remainder enters. <hi>Mr. Attorney Finch.</hi> The firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
will be, whether this <hi>Proviſo</hi> be a Condition or a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?
2. Whether notice be requiſite in this caſe, or not?
For the firſt, I take it to be a Limitation, and that it muſt
ſo be expounded, and not as a Condition. <hi>Dyer: 10 Eliz.
317. Plowd. queres, 108. Moor. 312. 29 Eliz. Com. Banc.
1 Leon. Plac. 383. 2 Leon. 581. Poph. 6, 7. 1 Roll. Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
411.</hi> and the ſame caſe is in <hi>Owen's Reports,</hi> 112. In
caſe of a Deviſe, a Condition muſt be conſtrued as a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation:
3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 388. There ſeems to be an Authority
againſt me in <hi>Mary Portingtons caſe, 10 Rep.</hi> in a reaſon
there given; but it is an accumulative reaſon, and does
not come to the point adjudged. I ſhall inſiſt upon <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
&amp; Hamond's caſe in Leon.</hi> it is reported likewiſe in
<hi>Boraſton's caſe, 3 Rep.</hi> and my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays, that it
doth reſolve a <hi>Quaere in Dyer,</hi> 327. ſo that expreſs words
of Condition, may by conſtruction in a Will, amount to
no more then a Limitation. The ſecond point is, whether
he ſhall be excuſed for breach of this Condition, for want
of notice? Firſt, I ſhall conſider it in reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Secondly, I reſpect of the grounds of notice in any
caſe. Firſt, in reſpect of the perſon: now he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in two capacities, as an Infant, and as a Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſée.
Now his Infancy cannot excuſe him: for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was annexed to the Deviſe expreſly, becauſe he was
an Infant. Secondly, He is a Purchaſor. Now if an
Infant purchaſe an Advowſon, and the Incumbent dye,
Laps ſhall incur, though he had notice of the death of the
Incumbent: and there is the ſame reaſon in this caſe,
where he is Deviſeé. Thirdly, An Infant is bound by all
Conditions in Déed, though not by Conditions in Law.
<hi>Com.</hi> 57. indeed 31 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 17. is againſt it; but in <hi>Bro.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62849:49"/>
Condition, Plac.</hi> 114. that caſe is ſaid to be no Law,
and <hi>Bro.</hi> agreeth with <hi>Plowd.</hi> 375. Secondly, Conſider
him as Deviſée: and then there will be leſs ground to
excuſe the want of notice. I take it to be a good dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt Lands deviſed to an Heir upon Condition,
and Lands deviſed to a Stranger upon Condition. To
the Heir notice muſt be given, but not to a Stranger:
for the Heir is in by Deſcent, and a Title by Law caſt
upon him. And he may very well be ſuppoſed to take no
notice of a Deviſe, becauſe the Law takes no notice of
a Deviſe to him. Now a Stranger, as he muſt needs
take notice of the Eſtate given, ſo he may very well be
obliged to take notice of the terms upon which it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
4 <hi>Report.</hi> 83. As for the grounds and reaſons of
the Law when notice in any caſe is requiſite, and when
not; Firſt, I take it for a rule, that every man is bound
to take notice, when none is bound to give him notice:
1 <hi>H. 7. 5. 13 H. 7. 9. 5 Rep. Sir Henry Conſtable's</hi>
caſe. 3 <hi>Leon. Burleigh's</hi> caſe in the Exchequer. 1 <hi>Cro. 390.
Rolls 856. Litt. Sect.</hi> 350. My ſecond ground is, that where
perſons are equally privy and concerned, there needs no
notice. <hi>Mich. 1649. Leviſton's caſe. 1 Leon. 31. 7 Rep.
117. Mallorie's caſe. 14 H.</hi> 7. 21. The third conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ariſeth from the circumſtances, and ſtrict formality of
all notice. You muſt not give notice of a Will by word
of mouth, but you muſt leave a Copy of it, compared:
8 <hi>Rep. Fraunce's caſe.</hi> Now the Infant in Remainder is
incapable of obſerving theſe circumſtances; and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both Strangers, are both to take notice at their
peril. Now to anſwer Objections: one is, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is penal, and inflicts a forfeiture of an Eſtate,
and that therefore notice ought to be given. I ſay, this
is rather a declamation, then an argument in Law. I
will put a caſe, where he that is ſubject to a penalty,
muſt give notice to preſerve himſelf: <hi>Poph.</hi> 10. ſo that
penalty or no penalty is not the buſineſs; but privity or
no privity guides the caſe. And <hi>Fraunce's caſe 8 Report,</hi>
was ruled upon the privity, not upon the penalty. 2 <hi>Cro.
56.</hi> and a caſe adjudged in this Court betwixt <hi>Lee</hi> and
<hi>Chamberlyne,</hi> ſeem againſt me; but they differ from ours;
and the 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> a caſe between <hi>Alford and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62849:50"/>
of London,</hi> is an Authority for me. <hi>Mr. Solicitor
North pro Defendente.</hi> I will not ſpeak much to that
point, whether it be a Condition or a Limitation. I
ſhall relie for that upon <hi>Mary Portington's caſe:</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words of Condition, cannot be conſtrued to be a
Limitation. <hi>Dyer</hi> 127. Now, if this be a Condition, then
the Heir regularly ought to enter: which he cannot do
in this caſe, becauſe a Remainder is here limited over.
The Law does interpret Conditions according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and circumſtances of the thing, and not ſtrictly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
according to the Letter. I do not obſerve that in
any caſe the Law ſuffers a man to incur a forfeiture,
where he hath not notice, or is not in the Law ſuppoſed
to have notice. He cited 2 <hi>Cro. 144. Molineux &amp; Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux:</hi>
and <hi>Fraunce's caſe 8 Report.</hi> He ſaid it was not
the intention of the party, that the Deviſée ſhould be
ſtrip'd of his Eſtate, and be never the wiſer. <hi>Saunders
&amp; Gerard's</hi> caſe is for me, of which I have a private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
He urged alſo the caſe of <hi>Curtis &amp; Wolverton,
Dyer,</hi> 354. and <hi>Penant's caſe 4 Report.</hi> It is objected,
That they that are to have the benefit of the Eſtate,
ought to take notice: I anſwer, the ſame Objection might
be made in <hi>Fraunce's</hi> caſe. Another reaſon given to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
the not-giving of notice, is, that the Condition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
no more then Nature teacheth: but I anſwer, in
caſe the Executor conſent, it is no matter whether the
Grand-mother conſent or not. And for their Authorities,
I ſhall rely upon 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 391. and upon <hi>Fraunce's caſe</hi> for
anſwering them. So he prayed Iudgment for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.
<hi>Hales.</hi> All the difference betwixt this caſe and
<hi>Fraunce's</hi> is, that in that caſe there is an Heir at Law,
and not in this. Now the Chancery is ſo juſt, as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Civil and Canon Law, as to perſonal Legacies,
but not as to Land.</p>

                  <p>TWo Women were Ioyntenants in Fée. One of them
made a Charter of Feoffment, and delivered the Déed
to the Feoffee, and ſaid to him, being within view of the Land,
<hi>Go, enter, and take poſſeſſion:</hi> but before any actual entry by the
Feoffee, the feoffor and feoffee entermarry. And the queſtion
was, whether or no this Marriage, coming between the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the Deed and the Feoffees Entry, had deſtroyed the
operation of the Livery within the view? <hi>Polynxfen.</hi> It hath
not: for the power and authority that the Feoffee hath to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is coupled with an Intereſt, and not countermandable in
Fact, and if ſo, not in Law. If I grant one of my Horſes
in my Stable, nothing paſſeth till Election, and yet the grant
is not revocable: ſo till attornment nothing paſſeth, and yet
the Deed is not revocable. If the Woman in our caſe, had
married a Stranger, that would not have been a revocation:
<hi>Perk.</hi> 29. I ſhall compare it to the caſe of 1 <hi>Cro. 284. Burdet
<hi>verſus</hi>
                     </hi>—Now for the intereſt gotten by the Husband by the
Marriage: he hath no Eſtate in his own right. If a man be
ſeized in the right of his Wife, and the Wife be attainted of
Felony, the Lord ſhall enter and ouſt the Husband; he gains
nothing but a bare perception of profits till Iſſue had: after
Iſſue had, he has an Eſtate for life. Where a man that hath
title to enter, comes into poſſeſſion, the Law doth execute the
Eſtate to him: 7 <hi>H. 7. 4. 2 R. 2. tit. Attornment. 28 Ed. 3. 11.
Bro. tit. Feoffment, 57. Moor, fol. 85. 3 Cro. 370. Hales</hi> ſaid

My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> to that caſe ſaith, that the Marriage without
Attornment, is an execution of the grant: but that I do not
believe; for the attendance of the Tenant ſhall not be altered
without his conſent. The effectual part of the Feoffment is,
<hi>Go, enter, and take poſſeſſion. Twiſden.</hi> Suppoſe there be

Acre, and they make an exchange: and then one of them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

<hi>Coleman.</hi> We have the very words for us in effect: for now

that rate, by alledging, that there is a Commiſſion of
Bankrupts out againſt the Plaintiff. If he be a Bankrupt,
you muſt take out a ſpecial <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and try the matter,
whether he be a Bankrupt or not. Which <hi>Jones</hi> ſaid they

<hi>Henry Lord Peterborough</hi> had only an Eſtate for

never underſtood till within theſe three years: but he had
claimed hitherto under a Settlement made 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. And to
prove a Settlement made 9 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. he produced a Witneſs,
who ſaid, that he being to purchaſe an Eſtate from my Lord
the Father, one <hi>Mr. Nicholls,</hi> who was then of Counſel to
my Lord, gave him a Copy of ſuch a Deed, to ſhew what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
my Lord had. But being asked whether he did ſee the

in the negative: whereupon the Court would not allow his

Verdict was for my <hi>Lord Mordant.</hi>

                     <hi>A</hi> Trial at Bar directed out of Chancery upon this Iſſue,
whether Waſt or no Waſt? <hi>Hales.</hi> By proteſtation I
try this cauſe, remembring the Statute of 4 <hi>Henr.</hi> 4. And
the Statute was read, whereby it is Enacted, That no
Iudgment given in any of the Kings Courts, ſhould be
called in queſtion, till it were reverſt by Writ of Error or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint.
He ſaid this cauſe had been tried in <hi>London,</hi> and in
a Writ of Error in Parliament the Iudgment affirmed;
Now they go into the Chancery, and we muſt try the cauſe
over again, and the ſame point. A Leaſe was made by <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liard</hi>
to <hi>Green</hi> in the year 1651. afterwards he deviſeth the
Reverſion to <hi>Cole;</hi> and <hi>Forth</hi> gets an under-Leaſe from
<hi>Green</hi> of the premiſſes, being a Brew-houſe. <hi>Forth</hi> pulls it
down, and builds the ground into Tenements. <hi>Hales.</hi> The
queſtion is, whether this be Waſt or no? and if it be Waſt at
Law, it is ſo in Equity. To pull down a Houſe is Waſt,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62849:53"/>
but if the Tenant build it up again before an Action brought,
he may plead that ſpecially. <hi>Twiſden.</hi> I think the Books are
<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con:</hi> whether the building of a new Houſe be Waſt
or not. <hi>Hales.</hi> If you pull down a Malt-mill, and build a
Corn-mill, that is Waſt: Then the Counſel urged, that it
could not be repaired without pulling it down. <hi>Twiſden.</hi>
That ſhould have been pleaded ſpecially. <hi>Hales.</hi> I hope the
Chancery will not Repeal an Act of Parliament. Waſt in
the Houſe is Waſt in the Curtelage, and Waſt in the Hall,
is Waſt in the whole Houſe. So the Iury gave a Verdict
for the Plaintiff, and gave him 120 <hi>l.</hi> damages.</p>

to <hi>William Jenkins</hi> for a Rent-charge, granted out of

was, whether this Rent ſhould go to the Heir at Common
Law, or ſhould be partible amongſt all the Sons. <hi>Hardres.</hi>
It ſhall go to the eldeſt Son, as Heir at Law: for I conceive
it is by reaſon of a Cuſtom time out of mind uſed, that Lands
in <hi>Kent</hi> are partible amongſt the Males. <hi>Lamb. Perambulat.</hi>
of <hi>Kent</hi> 543. Now this being a thing newly created, it wants

A feoffment in Fee is made of <hi>Gavel-kind</hi> Lands upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
the Condition ſhall go to the Heirs at Common Law,
and not according to the deſcent of the Land. <hi>Co. Litt.</hi> 376.
If a warranty be annex'd to ſuch Lands, it ſhall deſcend only
upon the eldeſt Son. Now this Rent-charge, being a thing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62849:54"/>
contrary to common right, and <hi>de novo</hi> created, is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable:
<hi>Litt. Sect.</hi> 222. 224. it is not a part of the

his Rent, unleſs by agreément betwixt the parties:
4 <hi>Edw. 3. 32. Bro. tit. Cuſtoms</hi> 58. if there be a Cuſtom in
a particular place, concerning Dower, it will not extend to a
Rent-charge: <hi>Fitz. Dower 58. Co. Litt. 12. Fitz. Avowry
207. 5 Edw.</hi> 4. 7. there is no occaſion in this caſe, to make
the Rent deſcendible to all: for the Land remains partible
amongſt the Males, according to the Cuſtom. And why a
Rent ſhould go ſo, to the prejudice of the Heir, I know not.
14 <hi>H.</hi> 88. it is ſaid, that a Rent is a different and diſtinct
thing from the Land. Then the language of the Law ſpeaks
for general Heirs, who ſhall not be diſinherited by conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The grand Objection is, whether the Rent ſhall not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the nature of the Land? 27 <hi>H. 8. 4. Fitzherb.</hi> ſaid, he
knew four Authorities that it ſhould: <hi>Fitz. Avowry</hi> 150. As
for his firſt caſe, I ſay, that Rent amongſt Parceners is of
another nature than this: for that is diſtreynable of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
right. As for the ſecond, I ſay the rule of it holds only
in caſes of Proceedings and Trials; which is not applicable
to his Cuſtom. His third caſe is, that if two Coparceners
make a feoffment, rendring Rent, and one dies, the Rent
ſhall not ſurvive. <hi>(To this I find no anſwer given) Litt.
Sect.</hi> 585. is further objected; where it is ſaid, that if Land
be deviſeable by Cuſtom, a Rent out of ſuch Lands may be
deviſed by the ſame Cuſtom: but Authorities claſh in this
point. He cited farther theſe books; <hi>viz. Lamb. Peramb. of

to all the Brothers: for it is of the quality of the Land, and
part of the Land: it is contained in the bowels of the Land,
and is of the ſame nature with it: 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 78. which I take
to be a direct Authority as well as an inſtance. <hi>Co. Lit. 132.

Land by Cuſtom, and in thoſe places he might have deviſed a

in a new Eſtate of Inheritance by way of entail: now this
Eſtate Tail in Gavelkind Lands hath been taken to deſcend
to all the Brothers; and the reaſon is, becauſe it is part of

of <hi>Kent</hi> are of common right, and if ſo, then our Rent-charge
will go of common right to all the Brothers. <hi>Hales,
Rainsford</hi> and <hi>Wyld</hi> were of Opinion, that the Rent ought
to deſcend to all the Brothers, according to the deſcent of the
Land: becauſe the Rent is part of the profits of the Land,

                  <p>A man covenanted to ſtand ſeized to the uſe of the Heirs

why a man ſhall not make his right Heir a Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
without putting the whole feé-ſimple out of himſelf. If
the Fathers Eſtate turns to an Eſtate for life, there will be
no queſtion. In the caſe of <hi>Bennet &amp; Mitford,</hi> there did
reſult an Eſtate for life, to knit the Limitation to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Eſtate. Here, 1. We are in the caſe of an Eſtate
Tail; and the Iudges uſe to go far in making ſuch a
Limitation good: then, 2. We are in the caſe of an Vſe,
which is conſtrued as favourably as may be to comply with
the intention of the party. This caſe is not as if he ſhould
have covenanted to ſtand ſeized to the uſe of the Heirs of
the body of <hi>J. D.</hi> there the Covenantor would have had
a Fee-ſimple in the mean time: but the caſe is all one
as if the Limitation had been to himſelf, and the Heirs

                     <hi>A</hi> Special Verdict. <hi>Francis</hi> the Father was Tenant for
life, the Remainder in Fée to <hi>Francis</hi> the Son; and by
the Deed, by which this Eſtate was thus ſettled, 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year
was appointed to be paid to <hi>Francis</hi> the Son during the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
life. The Son releaſeth to the Father all arrears of
Rent, Annuities, Titles and Demands by virtue of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture:
and the queſtion was, whether this Releaſe paſſed
the Inheritance as well as the Annuity? <hi>Polynxfen.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this Releaſe ſhall not paſs any Eſtate in the Land: and
my reaſon is, becauſe there is no mention of the Land, nor
of any Eſtate therein. The principal thing intended and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
is the Annuity: then the Releaſe concludes, <hi>to the day
of the Releaſe,</hi> which doth manifeſt, that he did not intend to
Releaſe any thing that was not to come to him till after the
death of his Father. It is true, here is the word <hi>demand,</hi>
but that will not do it: 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 258. Then for the word <hi>Titles:</hi>
by <hi>Plowd.</hi> 494. and 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 153. it is where a man hath law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
cauſe to have that that another doth poſſeſs; ſometimes it
is taken in a larger ſenſe, and then it doth include right.
Vpon conſtruction of this Releaſe I think it ought to be taken
in the ſtricter ſenſe, and the intention of the party muſt guide
the conſtruction. For where there are general words in the
beginning, and particular words afterwards, the particular
do reſtrain the general: and ſo <hi>vice verſa</hi> for enlargement: he
cited <hi>Hen &amp; Hanſon's caſe, 15 Car.</hi> 2. in this Court: where a
Releaſe of all demands would not Releaſe a Rent-charge by the
Opinion of thrée Iudges againſt <hi>Twiſden,</hi> for that reaſon; and
becauſe words in Deeds are to be taken according to common
acceptation: he cited 2 <hi>Rolls</hi> 409. In our caſe, the general
words of all Suits and Titles are limited and reſtrained to
the Annuity and Title of that, and ſhall not by a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
be extended to any thing elſe. <hi>Hales.</hi> How hath the
Inheritance gone? <hi>Polynxfen.</hi> The Grandchild has that.
<hi>Hales.</hi> I think a Releaſe of all demands will not extinguiſh a
Rent: but if it were all demands out of Land, it were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing. It hath béen held over and over again, that it
does not extinguiſh and diſcharge a Covenant not broken.
But what ſay you to this Releaſe of all <hi>Titles?</hi> for it appears
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62849:56"/>
in expreſs terms, that the Son did not only releaſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears
of the Annuity, but the thing it ſelf; and not only ſo,
but all other Titles by virtue of that Deed: ſuppoſe the caſe
had been but thus; the Father is Tenant for life, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
to the Son for Life; the Son releaſeth to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the Title that he has by vertue of that Deed: had not
this paſſed the Sons Eſtate for life? In the caſes that you
have cited, it is allowed that a Releaſe of all Titles, will
paſs a right to Land. He had a Title to the Annuity,
and a title to the Remainder: now he releaſeth the Annuity,
and all other Titles which he hath by that Deed, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
howſoever: To hear <hi>Serjeant Maynard</hi> on the other

Rot. 153. Jerman &amp; Johnſon:</hi> One deviſed all his Eſtate,

came but to 20 <hi>l.</hi> and his Debts were 100 <hi>l.</hi> there indeed all
his real Eſtate paſſed becauſe of the payment of his Debts.
And in our caſe, the following particulars are but a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Land, and contain no limitation of the Eſtate.
If a man deviſeth black Acre to one and the Heirs of his
body, and alſo deviſeth white Acre to the ſame perſon, he
hath but an Eſtate for life in white Acre, though he hath a
Fee-ſimple in the other: for the word <hi>alſo</hi> is not ſo ſtrong
as if it had been <hi>in the ſame manner. Moor 152. Yel. 209.
Weſton contra.</hi> I conceive an Eſtate of Inheritance doth
paſs; for the word <hi>Eſtate</hi> comprehendeth all his Intereſt.
When a man deviſeth all his Eſtate, he leaves nothing
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62849:56"/>
in himſelf: in that caſe of <hi>Jerman</hi> it was held, that <hi>all
my Eſtate</hi> comprehends all my Title and Intereſt in the

the Fee-ſimple of his Land: and the word, <hi>all his Eſtate,</hi>
is as comprehenſive as that. <hi>Hales &amp; Wyld.</hi> By a Grant
or Releaſe of <hi>totum ſtatum ſuum,</hi> the Fee-ſimple will paſs:
if the words had been <hi>all my Tenant-right Lands,</hi> it had

                     <hi>A</hi> Writ of Error of a Iudgment in the County Palatine
of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in Replevin: The Defendant makes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſance
as Bayliff to <hi>Ann Moſely:</hi> The Lands were the
Lands of <hi>Rowland Moſely,</hi> and he covenanted to levy a Fine of
them, to the uſe of himſelf and the Heirs males of his body, the
remainder in Tail to ſeveral others, the remainder to his own
right Heirs. Provided, that if there ſhall be a failer of Iſſue
Male of his body, and <hi>Dame Elizabeth</hi> be dead, and <hi>Ann
Moſely</hi> be married, or of the age of 21 years, then ſhe ſhall
have 200 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for ten years: Then <hi>Rowland</hi> dies,
leaving Iſſue <hi>Sir Edward Moſely, Sir Edward</hi> makes a Leaſe
for 1000 years, then levies a Fine, and ſuffers a Recovery;
Then dies without Iſſue Male: And the Contingents did all
happen. The queſtion is, whether this Rent-charge of 200 <hi>l.
per annum</hi> be barred by the Fine and Recovery, and ſhall not
operate upon the Leaſe? <hi>Levings.</hi> I conceive the Fine is not
well pleaded, for nothing is ſaid of the Kings Silver, and if
that be not paid, it is void: Then they have pleaded a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Recovery, but not the Execution of it by Entry. Now
I conceive the Common Recovery doth deſtroy the Eſtate
Tail, but not the Rent. The reaſon why a common Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
is a Bar, is becauſe of the intended recompence. Now
that is a fictitious thing: 9 <hi>Rep. Beamonts caſe. 1 Cro. Stone
and Newman, Cuppledicks caſe.</hi> Now this Rent is a meer
poſſibility, and hath no relation to the Eſtate of the Land.
Then again, when the Recovery was ſuffered, the Rent was
not in being: Now a Recovery will never bar but where the
Eſtate is dependant upon it, either in Reverſion or Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For that caſe of <hi>Moor pl.</hi> 201. I conceive he is barred,
becauſe the Reverſion is barred by the Fine. 3 <hi>Cro. 727. 792.
White and Geriſhe's caſe,</hi> the ſame caſe 2 <hi>And. 190. Noy p.</hi> 9.
Another reaſon is, becauſe the Rent remains in the ſame
plight, notwithſtanding the Fine. Another reaſon is, it was
a meer poſſibility at the time of the Fine and Recovery. <hi>Pell
and Brownes caſe</hi> is for me. In our caſe is no Eſtate <hi>in eſſe</hi>
to be barred. Then this Eſtate is granted out of the Eſtate
of the Feoffeés, As in <hi>Whitlocks caſe 8 Rep.</hi> 71. the Eſtates
for years, which there is a power to make, ſhall be ſaid to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62849:60"/>
precede all the Limitations. There is no other way for ſecuring
younger Childrens Portions by the ſame Deéd, but it may be
done by another Déed, as in <hi>Goodyer and Clarkes caſe. Mr.
Finch contra.</hi> I conceive the Rent is barred upon the reaſon
of <hi>Capells caſe.</hi> They ſay not. (1) Becauſe it doth only
charge the Remainder. (2) The intended recompence doth
not go to it. (3) This Leaſe for 1000 years doth precede
the Fine. The Law will never invert the operation of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,
but <hi>ut res magis valeat, Bredon's caſe.</hi> Then for the
intended recompence, that cannot be the reaſon of barring a
Remainder, for the Eſtate Tail was barred before. 3 <hi>Leon.
157.</hi> But <hi>Moor fol.</hi> 73. ſaith, it is the favour the Law hath
for Recoveries: And till the Reverſion takes place in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Rent cannot ariſe out of the Reverſion, nor ſo long
as this Leaſe is in being. <hi>Hales.</hi> You make two great points,
(1) Whether the Rent be barred by the Common Recovery?
(2) Whether the Rent-charge ſhall ariſe out of the Leaſe for
years? This is plain; if Tenant in Tail grant a Rent-charge,
and ſuffer a Common Recovery, the Rent-charge
will not be avoided; So that if Tenant in Tail grant a Rent,
a Recovery will not bar that, though it doth a Reverſion;
but the reaſon of theſe caſes is, becauſe the Eſtate of him
that ſuffers the Recovery, is charged with the Rent. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be a Limitation of a Vſe upon Condition, and
<hi>Ceſtui que uſe</hi> ſuffers a Recovery that will not deſtroy the
Condition, the Eſtate being charged with it, for the <hi>Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veror</hi>
can have the Eſtate only as he that ſuffered the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
had it; And therefore there is an Act of Parliament to
enable Recoverors to diſtrein without Attornment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo long as any one comes in by that Recovery, he comes
in in continuance of the Eſtate Tail, and coming in ſo, he
is lyable to all the charges of Tenant in Tail. Now what
is the reaſon why Tenant in Tail, ſuffering a Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
a Rent by him in Remainder ſhall be barred? The
reaſon is, becauſe the Recoveror comes in in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that Eſtate that is not ſubject to the Rent, but is
above all thoſe charges; now no recompence can come to
ſuch a Rent. And therefore there is another reaſon why a
Common Recovery will bar; at Common Law upon an
Eſtate Tail, which was a Fée-ſimple conditional, a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
could not be limited over; becauſe but a poſſibility: but
now comes that Statute <hi>De donis conditionalibus,</hi> and makes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62849:61"/>
it an eſtate tail, and a Common recovery is an inherent
priviledge in the Eſtate that was never taken away by
that Statute <hi>De donis,</hi> the Law takes it as a conveiance
excepted out of the Statute, as if he were abſolutely ſeiſed
in fee, and this is by conſtruction of Law; It is true, there
can be no recompence to him that hath but a poſſibilitie.
But the buſineſs of recompence is not material, as to this
charge; And the reaſon of <hi>Whites caſe</hi> and other caſes put
explain this. Now what difference between this and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
caſe?</hi> Say they, there the charge doth ariſe ſubſequent,
but here the charge doth ariſe precedent; why I ſay the
charge doth ariſe precedent to the Remainder, but ſubſequent
to the Eſtate tail, for it is not to take effect till the Eſtate
tail be determined. It was doubted in the Queens time,
whether a Remainder for years was barred, but it hath béen
otherwiſe practiſed ever ſince and there is no colour againſt
it. Now you do agrée that the Remainder to the right
Heirs of one living ſhall be barred, for the Eſtate is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
though the Perſon be uncertain; So long as the Rent
doth not come within the compaſs and limitation of the
Eſtate tail the Rent is extinct and killed, there is nothing
to keep life in it: But whether doth not the Leaſe for years
preſerve it? Heretofore it was a queſtion among young
men, Whether if Tenant in Tail granted a Rent Charge
for Life, then makes a Leaſe for three Lives; In this caſe
though the Rent before would have dyed with Tenant in
Tail, yet this Rent will continue now during the three
Lives, which it will. And it hath been queſtioned, if he
had made a Leaſe for years inſtead of the Leaſe for lives
if that would have ſupported the Rent? Now in our caſe
if the Leaſe for years were chargeable the Rent would ariſe
out of that; But if this Rent ſhould continue then moſt
mens Eſtates in <hi>England</hi> would be ſhaken. <hi>Wild.</hi> The
Leaſe for years doth not preſerve the Rent, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Recovery doth bar it: For <hi>Pell &amp; Brownes caſe;</hi> in
that Caſe the Recovery could not barr the poſſibility, for he
was not Tenant in Tail that did ſuffer the Recovery, but
he had only a Fee ſimple determinable, and the contingent
Remainder not depend upon an Eſtate Tail, nay did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
by way of Remainder, but by way of Contingency; It
is true, Iuſtice <hi>Dodridge</hi> did hold otherwiſe, but the reſt of
Iudges gave Iudgment againſt him upon very good reaſon.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62849:61"/>
                     <hi>Twiſden.</hi> I never heard that caſe cited, but it was grumbled
at. <hi>Hales.</hi> But to your knowledge and mine, they always
gave Iudgment accordingly. A man made a gift in Tail
determinable upon his non-payment of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
over in Tail to <hi>B.</hi> with other Remainders, Tenant in
Tail before the day of payment of the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> ſuffers a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Recovery, and doth not pay the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> yet becauſe he
was Tenant in Tail when he ſuffered the Recovery, by that
he had barred all, and had an Eſtate in Fee by that Recovery.
At a day after <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid, the Rent was granted before the
Leaſe for years, and is not to take effect till the Eſtate Tail
be ſpent, and a common Recovery bars it: If there be Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in Tail, reſerving Rent, a common Recovery will not
bar it; ſo if a Condition be for payment of Rent, it will not
bar it: But if a Condition be for doing a collateeal thing,
it is a bar. And ſo if Tenant in Tail be with a Limitation
ſo long as ſuch a Tree ſhall ſtand, a common Recovery will
bar that Limitation.</p>

Rent to a Stranger, an Action of Covenant will lye by the

it was an Aſſignment for maintenance. <hi>Hales.</hi> That ought to

transferring, when it cannot transfer, ſignifies nothing.

                  <p>TRial at Bar, the queſtion was, Whether the Earl of
<hi>Peterborough</hi> was Tenant for life only of the Mannor
of <hi>Mayden:</hi> The Defendant did not appear, the Plaintiff
thereupon deſired to examine his Witneſſes, that ſo he might
preſerve their Evidence. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> When they do not appear,
what good will that do you? for they will ſay, you ſet up a
man of ſtraw, and pull him down again. There was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Deed of entail, with a power of revocation in it, and
after the Deed exhibited was made, whereby the Eſtate was
otherwiſe ſettled, and there was a Ioynture to the preſent
Lady, and done by perſons of great Learning in the Law:
The Revocation was to be by Deed under my Lords Hand
and Seal in the preſence of thrée Witneſſes: Now the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was, whether this ſecond Deed was a revocation in
Law, and an Execution of that power? And the Court told
the Counſel, they ſhould find it ſpecially if they would; but
they refuſed. <hi>Hales.</hi> In 16 <hi>Car. Snape</hi> and <hi>Sturts caſe,</hi> If
there be a power of revocation, and a Leaſe for years is made,
it doth ſuſpend <hi>quoad</hi> the term, but after it is good. Then
it hath been queſtioned formerly if there be ſuch a power,
and the perſon makes a Leaſe and Releaſe, whether it was
a Revocation. But ſhall we conceive the learned Counſel
in this caſe would have ventured upon an implicit revocation,
and not have made an expreſs revocation? So that you muſt
be non-ſuit, or find it ſpecially. But the iſſue being, If he
wee only Tenant for life, he ſaid he muſt go back to
the Chancery to amend it, for by the Deéd produced, he hath
an Eſtate for life, and the Reverſion in Fee.</p>

he ought not to carry him round about a great way for the

                     <hi>A</hi> Trial at Bar; The queſtion, whether a Will or no
Will? The Plaintiff produced a Deed indented, made
between two parties, the Man and his Son: and the Father
did agree to give the Son ſo much, and the Son did agree to
pay ſuch and ſuch Debts and Sums of money: And there
were ſome particular expreſſions reſembling the form of a
Will; as, that he was ſick of body, and did give all his
Goods and Chattels, &amp;c. but the Writing was both Sealed
and delivered as a Deed; And they gave evidence, that he
intended it for his laſt Will; which, the Court ſaid, was a
good proof of his Will. Then the Defendant ſetting up an
Entail, the Plaintiff exhibited an Exemplification of a Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
in the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> Court in <hi>ancient demeſne;</hi>
The other ſide objected, that they did not prove it a true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
But becauſe it was ancient, the Court ſaid they ſhould
not be ſo ſtrict upon the Evidence of it, for the other ſide ſaid,
the <hi>Court Rolls</hi> were burned in <hi>Baſeing-houſe</hi> in the time of
the Wars. <hi>Hales.</hi> I remember a caſe, where one had gotten
a preſentation to the Parſonage of <hi>Goſnall in Lincoln-ſhire,</hi>
and brought a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and the Defendant pleaded an
Appropriation; there was no Licence of Appropriation produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,

Then they objected, that they ought to prove <hi>ſeiſin</hi> in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the <hi>Praecipe. Hales.</hi> It being an ancient Recovery,
we will not put them to prove that. He ſaid the Mayor of

being burned, and that Exemplification was allowed for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

doth not alter the Eſtate for life. Objection, The Recovery
is of Land in <hi>Kingſcleare,</hi> whereas the Land claimed is in a
particular Ville called—And the Vills are ſeveral, and
there are diſtinct Courts in every Ville. <hi>Hales.</hi> There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

A ſpecial Verdict, that the Lands are Copyhold Lands,
and ſurrendred to the uſe of one for eleven years, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
for five years to the Daughter, the Remainder to the
right heirs of the Tenant for eleven years; The eleven years
expire, the Daughter is admitted, the five years expire; And
there being a Son and Daughter by one <hi>Venter,</hi> and a Son
by another <hi>Venter,</hi> the Son of the firſt <hi>Venter</hi> dies before ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,

bring <hi>Trover</hi> for cutting down of Trees; And the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was, if the admittance of Tenant for years, was the
admittance of the Son in Remainder? <hi>Levings.</hi> I conceive
it is; and then the Son is ſeized, and the Daughter of the
whole blood is his heir; and he cited 4 <hi>Rep. 23. 3 Cro. 503. Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's
caſe. Wyld.</hi> The Eſtate is bound by the Surrender. <hi>Hales.</hi>
If a man doth ſurrender to the uſe of <hi>John Styles,</hi> till admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
there is no Eſtate in him, but remains in the Surrenderor;
but he hath a right to have an admittance; If a ſurrender be
to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his heirs, his heir is in without admittance if <hi>J. S.</hi>
dies. About this hath indeed been diverſity of Opinion, but
the better Opinion hath been according to the <hi>Lord Coke's</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
I do not ſee any inconvenience, why the admiſſion of
Tenant for life or years, ſhould not be the admittance of all
in Remainder, for Fines are to be paid, notwithſtanding by
the particular Remainders; and ſo the Books ſay it ſhall be
no prejudice to the Lord. <hi>Twiſd.</hi> I think it is ſtrong, that
the admiſſion of Leſſee for years, is the admiſſion of
him in Remainder; for as in a caſe of <hi>poſſeſſio fratris</hi>
the Eſtate is bound, ſo that the Siſter ſhall be heir; ſo
here the Eſtate is bound, and goes to him in Remainder.
<hi>Hales.</hi> I ſhall not prejudice the Lord; for if a Fine be
aſſeſſed for the whole Eſtate, there is an end of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs;
but if a Fine be aſſeſſed only for a particular
Eſtate, the Lord ought to have another. If a ſurrender
be to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> for life, the Remainder to his eldeſt

                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:62849:66"/>

the caſe, (1) Whether the Son doth take by deſcent?
(2) Admitting he doth not, whether he can take by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe?
We muſt make a great difference betweén Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances
of Eſtates by way of uſe, and at Common
Law; A man cannot convey to himſelf an Eſtate by a
Conveyance at Common Law, but by way of Vſe he
may. But now in our caſe here doth doth retorn by opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Law an Eſtate to <hi>Michael</hi> for his life, which is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62849:67"/>
conjoyned with the Limitation to his heirs. The reaſon
is, becauſe a Limitation to the heirs of his body, is in
effect to himſelf: this is perfectly according to the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the parties. Objection. The uſe being never out of
<hi>Michael,</hi> he hath the old uſe, and ſo it muſt be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
uſe to the heirs of his body. But, I ſay, we
are not here to raiſe a new Eſtate in the Covenantor,
but to qualifie the Eſtate in Fee in himſelf: for the old
Eſtate is to be made an Eſtate for life, to ſerve the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.
Further Objection, It ſhall be the old Eſtate
in Fee, as, if a man deviſeth his Lands to his heirs,
the heir is in of the old Eſtate. But, I anſwer, if he
qualifie the Eſtate, the Son muſt take it ſo, as, in <hi>Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
fo.</hi> So in this caſe is a new qualification. <hi>Roll

poſſible to take by deſcent, this would be a Contingent

have come to the heir at Common Law, if no expreſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
had been, and it cannot be intended that he did
mean an heir at Common Law, becauſe he did ſpecially li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

                  <p>
                     <hi>A Feme Covert</hi> departs from her Husband againſt his
will,<note place="margin">Aſſumpſit vers Baron &amp; Feme pur Wares vend &amp; deliver al Feme.</note> and continues abſent from him divers years;
afterwards the wife deſires to cohabit with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
again, but the husband refuſeth to admit her;
and from that time the wife lives ſeparate from him; during
this ſeparation, the husband forbids a Tradeſman of <hi>London</hi>
to truſt his Wife with any Goods or Wares; yet for divers
years before and afterwards, allows his wife no maintenance;
the Tradeſman, contrary to the prohibition of the Husband,
ſells and delivers divers Wares to the wife upon credit, at
a reaſonable price; and the Wares ſo ſold and delivered to
the wife are neceſſary for her, and ſuitable to the degree of
her husband: The Wares are not paid for; wherefore the
Tradeſman brings an Action upon the caſe againſt the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and declares that the husband was indebted to him in
40 <hi>l.</hi> for divers Wares and Merchandiſes formerly to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
ſold and delivered, and that the Husband in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof did promiſe to pay him the ſaid 40 <hi>l.</hi> That the
Husband hath not paid the ſame unto him, although thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
required; and for that money the Action is brought againſt
the Husband. And, whether this Action will lie againſt the
Husband for the Wares thus ſold and delivered to the wife,
againſt the will, and contrary to the Prohibition of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
or not, is the queſtion? This caſe is the meaneſt that
ever received Reſolution in this place, but as the ſame is
now handled, it is of as great conſequence to all the Kings
people of this Realm, as any caſe can be; it concerns every
individual perſon of both Sexes, that is, or hereafter ſhall
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62849:68"/>
be married within this Kingdom, in the firſt and neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
that is, betwixt man and wife. The holy ſtate of
Matrimony was ordained by Almighty God in Paradiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fall of man, ſignifying unto us that myſtical Vnion
which is between Chriſt and his Church, and ſo it is the firſt
Relation: And when two perſons are joyned in that holy
State, they twain become one Fleſh, and ſo it is the neareſt
Relation. This caſe toucheth the man in point of his power
and dominion over his wife, and it concerns the woman in
point of her ſubſtance and livelihood. I will deliver my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
plainly and freely, according as I conceive the Law to
be, without favouring the one, or courting the other Sex.
I hold, that Iudgment ought to be given for the Defendant.
The caſe hath been ſo fully argued, and all the Authorities ſo
particularly vouched by my Brothers, who have already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
their Opinions, that nothing is left for me to ſay, which
hath not béen ſpoken by them in better terms than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
my ſelf. It will be a trouble to your Lordſhips for me
to repeat their Arguments, and yet without doing ſo, it will
be impoſſible for me to ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe. It
ſhall be my endeavour therefore, rather to anſwer the reaſons
and objections given and made by my two Brothers, who
have ſo copiouſly argued for the womans power, than to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
the caſe again on the ſame grounds which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
delivered.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed by all my Brothers who have argued, as I
conceive, that a Feme covert generally cannot bind or charge
her husband by any Contract made by her, without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
or aſſent of her husband precedent or ſubſequent, either
expreſs or implyed. But the queſtion in this caſe is, if the
Contract of a Feme covert for Wares for her neceſſary Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
made without the conſent, and contrary to the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her husband, ſhall bind her husband?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I hold that the husband ſhall not be charged by ſuch
a Contract, although he do not allow any maintenance to his
wife.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, admit the husband were chargable general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by ſuch a Contract, yet I conceive that this Action
doth not lye for the Plaintiff, as this Declaration is, and
as this Verdict is found againſt the Defendant in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62849:69"/>
For the firſt, every gift, contract or bargain, is or contains
an agreement, for the contractor or bargainor will that the
donee or bargainée ſhall have the things contracted for; and
the other is content to take them, and ſo in every Contract
there is a mutual aſſent of their minds, which mutual aſſent
is an agreément: <hi>Plow. Com. Fogaſſa's caſe.</hi> Afterwards in
the ſame caſe <hi>fo.</hi> 17. it is ſaid, agreement is a word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of two words, <hi>ſcilicet, agregatio &amp; mentium,</hi> ſo that
<hi>aggreamentum</hi> is <hi>aggregatio mentium,</hi> or thus, <hi>aggreamentum</hi>
is no other but a union or conjunction of two minds in any
matter or thing, done, or to be done, according to that of
<hi>Sir Edward Cokes, Com. fo. 47. Contractus eſt quaſi actus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
actum:</hi> But a Feme Covert cannot give a mutual aſſent
of her mind, nor do any act without her husband; for her will
and mind (as alſo her ſelf) is under and ſubject unto the
will or mind of her husband; and conſequently ſhe cannot
make any bargain or contract (of her ſelf) to bind her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
The ſecond ground of the Law of <hi>England</hi> is the
Law of God, <hi>Doctor &amp; Student cap. 6. fo.</hi> 10. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when God created woman an help-meat for man, he ſaid,
they twain ſhall be one Fleſh; and thereupon our Law ſays,
that husband and wife are but one perſon in the Law: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after the Fall, the Iudgment of God upon woman was,
<hi>Thy deſire ſhall be to thy Husband, for thy will ſhall be ſubject
to thy husband, and he ſhall rule over thee, 3 Gen.</hi> 16. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Law put the wife <hi>ſub poteſtate viri,</hi> and ſays, <hi>quod
ipſa poteſtatem ſui non habeat, ſed vir ſuus,</hi> and is diſabled
to make any grant, contract or bargain, without the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or conſent of her husband, <hi>Bract. lib. 3. cap. 32. fo.</hi> 15.
The books and authorities of our Law which prove this point,
have been all particularly vouched already, and I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
them again, nor do I know any one particular point to
the contrary. The words of the book are obſervable, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
If a Feme Covert make a contract, or buy any thing in
the Market or elſewhere, without the allowance or conſent of
her husband, although it come to the uſe of the husband, yet
the contract is void, and ſhall not charge the husband; but if
a man command or licence his wife to buy things neceſſary,
or agree that ſhe ſhall buy, he ſhall be bound by this command
or licence: <hi>Old N. Br. 62. 21 H. 7. 70. F. N. Br.</hi> 120. which
proves, that it is not the buying or contract of the wife, which
binds or charges the husband (for that is void in it ſelf) but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62849:69"/>
the command or licence of the husband, which makes it the
contract or bargain of the husband.</p>
                  <p>As to my Brother <hi>Twiſden's</hi> ſaying, that all thoſe books
are where the Wife deals or trades as a Factor to her husband,
and all grounded upon that reaſon, the words themſelves
prove the contrary; for the difference taken by all theſe books
is, between the buying and contract of the wife without the
knowledge or conſent of her husband; and a buying or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
had by the wife with allowance or command of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
In the firſt caſe, the buying or contract is void, in the
other the allowance or command makes it good, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
or bargain of the husband: Beſides, weigh the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
which would follow, if the Law were otherwiſe.
Iudges in their Iudgments ought to have a great regard to
the generality of the caſes of the Kings Subjects, and to the
inconveniencies which may enſue thereon by the one way or
the other, 1 <hi>Rep. 52. Altenwoods caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Iudges in giving their reſolutions in caſes depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, are to judge of inconveniencies as things illegal,
and an argument <hi>ab Inconventi</hi> is very ſtrong to prove that it
is againſt Law. <hi>Plo. Com.</hi> 279. 379. then examine the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
which muſt enſue if the Law were according to
my Brother <hi>Twiſdens</hi> and <hi>Tyrrells</hi> Opinions: If the contract
or bargain of the wife, made without the allowance or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the husband, ſhall bind him upon pretence of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Apparel, it will be in the power of the wife (who by the
Law of God, and of the Land, is put under the power of the
husband, and is bound to live in ſubjection unto him) to rule
over her husband, and undo him, maugre his head, and it
ſhall not be in the power of the husband to prevent it. The
wife ſhall be her own Carver, and judge of the fitneſs of her
Apparel, of the time when 'tis neceſſary for her to have new
Cloathes, and as often as ſhe pleaſeth, without asking the
advice or allowance of her husband; And is ſuch power ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Iudgment of Almighty God inflicted upon woman,
for being firſt in the Tranſgreſſion? <hi>Thy deſire ſhall be to
thy husband, and he ſhall rule over thee.</hi> Will wives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the kindneſs and favours of their husbands, or be
obſervant towards them as they ought to be, if ſuch a power be
put into their hands?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62849:70"/>
Secondly, Admit that in truth the wife wants neceſſary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
Woollen and Lining thereupon, ſhe goes into <hi>Pater-Noſter-Row</hi>
to a Mercer, and takes up Stuff, and makes a
contract for neceſſary Clothes, thence goes up into <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi>
and takes up Lining there in like manner, and alſo goes
into a third Street, and fits her ſelf with Ribbonds, and
other neceſſaries ſuitable to her occaſions and her husbands
degree. This done, ſhe goes away, diſpoſeth of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
to furniſh her ſelf with money to go abroad to <hi>Hide-Park,</hi>
to ſcore at <hi>Gleeke,</hi> or the like. Next morning this
good woman goes abroad into ſome other part of <hi>London,</hi>
makes her neceſſity and want of Apparel known, and takes
more Wares upon truſt, as ſhe had done the day before, after
the ſame manner ſhe goes to a third and fourth place, and
makes new Contracts for freſh Wares, none of theſe Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
knowing or imagining ſhe was formerly furniſhed by the
other, and each of them ſeeing and believing her to have great
need of the Commodities ſold her; ſhall not the husband be
chargeable and lyable to pay every one of theſe, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of the Wife doth bind him? Certainly every one of theſe
hath as juſt cauſe to ſue the husband as the other, and he is
as lyable to the Action of the laſt, as the firſt or ſecond, if the
wives contract ſhall bind him; and where this will end no
man can divine or foreſee.</p>
                  <p>As for my Brother <hi>Tyrrells</hi> ſaying we may not alter the Law
becauſe an inconvenience may follow thereon, that is true:
but we ought to foreſée and provide againſt ſuch inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
as may ariſe, before we adjudge or declare the Law in a
particular caſe in queſtion, whether the Law be ſo or not.
And that is the caſe here; It is objected, that the husband is
bound of common right, to provide for, and maintain his
wife; and the Law having diſabled the wife to bind her ſelf
by her contract, therefore the burden ſhall reſt upon the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who by Law is bound to maintain her, and he ſhall do
it <hi>nolens volens;</hi> generally the antecedent is moſt true; for
ſhe is bone of his bone, fleſh of his fleſh, and no man
did ever hate his own fleſh, ſo far as not to preſerve
it.</p>
                  <p>But apply this general propoſition to our particular caſe,
and then ſee what Logick there is in the argument. I am
bound to maintain and provide for my wife: therefore (my
wife) departing from me againſt my will, ſhall be her own
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62849:70"/>
Carver, and take up what Apparel ſhe pleaſeth upon truſt,
without my privity or allowance, and I ſhall be bound to pay
for it; this is our caſe, for there is not a word throughout the
whole Verdict, that the wife did want neceſſary Apparel, that ſhe
ever acquainted her husband with any ſuch matter, that ſhe ever
deſired the husband to ſupply her with money to buy it, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to provide for her: or that the husband did deny, refuſe,
or neglect to do it. Beſides, although it be true, that the
husband is bound to maintain his wife, yet that is with this
limitation, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo long as ſhe keeps the ſtation wherein the
Law hath plac'd her, ſo long as ſhe continues a help meet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; for if a woman of her own head, without the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or Iudgment of the Church, which hath united them,
in the holy State of Matrimony (which only can ſeparate
that, or diſſolve this Vnion) depart from her husband againſt
his will, (be the pretence what it will) ſhe doth thereby put
her ſelf out of the husbands protection, ſo that during this
unlawful ſeparation, ſhe is no part of her husbands care,
charge or family. The King is the Head of the Common-wealth:
his Office is, and he is bound of right to protect and
preſerve his Subjects in their Perſons, Goods and Eſtates.
And on that ground, every Loyal Subject is ſaid to be within
the Kings Protection: <hi>Plo. 315. Caſe of Mynes, F. N.
Br.</hi> 232.</p>
                  <p>But a man may put himſelf out of the Kings Protection
by his Offence, as, by forſaking his Allegiance to the King,
and owning or ſetting up any Forreign Iurisdiction, and then
every man may do unto him as to the Kings Enemy, and he
ſhall have no remedy or Recovery by the Kings Laws or
Writs, 27 <hi>E. 3. caſe the firſt.</hi> The husband is head of the
wife, as fully as the King is Head of the Common-wealth;
and the wife by the Law is put <hi>ſub poteſtate viri,</hi> and under
his protection, although he hath not <hi>poteſtatem vitae &amp; necis</hi>
over her, as the King hath over his Subjects. When the
wife departs from her husband againſt his will, ſhe forſakes
and deſerts his Government, ſhe erects and ſets up a new Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
and aſſumes to govern her ſelf, beſides, (at leaſt
if not againſt) the Law of God and of the Land; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is but juſt that the Law for this Offence, ſhould put
her in the ſame plight in the petit Common-wealth of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhould,
that it puts the Subject for the like Offence in the
great Common-wealth of the Realm; and this according to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62849:71"/>
the Civil Law, namely, <hi>Si Uxor propria (fine Culpa mariti)

68.</hi> The words of the Writ are obſervable, <hi>ſc. occidit virum
ſuum inter brachia ſua,</hi> and prove that the woman ought to be
<hi>inter brachia viri ſui,</hi> or otherwiſe ſhe hath not the priviledge
of a wife.</p>
                  <p>By an argument <hi>a pari,</hi> as the wife ſhall not have remedy
againſt the Murtherer of her husband after his death, if he
were not <hi>inter brachia ſua,</hi> at the time of his death, <hi>pari ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi>
ſhe ſhall not have ſupport or maintenance from her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in his life, when ſhe puts her ſelf <hi>extra brachia ſua,</hi> againſt
his will.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis objected by my Brother <hi>Tyrrell;</hi> It appears not
in whoſe default this departure was, whether in his or her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault.
Thereto I anſwer, that the Law doth not allow a
wife to depart from her husband in any caſe, or for any cauſe
whatſoever of her own head. An expreſs command is laid
upon her by the Law of God to the contrary, <hi>Cor. 7. 10. To
the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord; let not the
wife depart from her husband.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proviſion which our Law hath made for the ſafeguard
of the perſon of a woman, in caſe of cruelty by her husband,
and for her maintenance in caſe the husband refuſes to allow
it, proves, that it is not lawful for the wife to depart from
her husbad of her own head, upon any pretence whatſoever.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62849:71"/>
If the wife be in fear, or in doubt of her husband, that he
will beat or kill her, ſhe ſhall have a <hi>Supplicavit</hi> out of the
Chancery againſt her husband, and cauſe him to find Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that he will not beat, nor intreat her otherwiſe then in
civil manner, and for to order and rule her, &amp;c. <hi>F. N. Br.
fo.</hi> 179. The words of the Writ are, <hi>Quod ipſum B. co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram

uxoris ſuae licite &amp; rationabilit' pertinet, non faciat nec
fieri procurabit.</hi> And if the husband refuſe to give or allow
neceſſary and fitting maintenance unto his wife, the Law hath
provided a remedy for her, by complaint to the Ordinary in the
Eccleſiaſtical Court.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is alledged by my Brother <hi>Tyrrell,</hi> that the wife
in our caſe did return, and deſire to cohabit with her husband
again, which he refuſed, and ſo ſhe is remitted to her former
condition. Admit that be true, yet her return hath not put
her in a better condition then ſhe was in before her departure,
in which caſe ſhe could not be her own Carver, and have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
her husband (according to her pleaſure) with Apparel,
but was to be clothed in ſuch ſort as her husband thought fit.
Beſides, in our caſe the wife departed from her husband, and
lived from him divers years after (before the Wares ſold, or
the Action brought) then ſhe deſired to cohabit with him, which
he refuſed to admit; and from that time ſhe lived from him.
This is all that appears in our caſe; and is this offence ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
purg'd, with a bare deſire to cohabit, without any other
ſubmiſſion and ſatisfaction given of the better carriage <hi>in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo?</hi>
The Law of God ſays, <hi>Wives be in ſubjection to
your husbands as unto the Lord: for the husband is the head of
the wife, as Chriſt is head of the Church, 1 Pet 3, 4. Epheſ.
5.</hi> 22. The Church declares, that one of the principal ends
for which Marriages was ordained, is for the mutual ſociety,
help and comfort, which the one ought to have of the other,
in proſperity and adverſity. It is alſo there ſaid, the woman
of her ſelf in contracting of Marriage, makes a ſolemn Vow
<hi>in facie Eccleſiae,</hi> to live together with her husband, in the holy
State of Matrimony, to obey him, and ſerve him, to love
him, and keep him in ſickneſs and in health, till death them
do part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:62849:72"/>
The wife, in our caſe, by departing from her husband
againſt his will, breaks all thoſe commands, and her own
Vow; ſhe makes a voluntary ſeparation, and temporary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
between her ſelf and her husband, ſhe deprives him of
that mutual ſociety, help and comfort (which ſhe owes to him)
for divers years; and are all theſe Offences waſhed away with
a bare deſire, without ſubmiſſion or contrition? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Confeſſion and promiſe of future Obedience, ought to
precede her remitter, or reſtitution to the priviledges of a
wife. The Prodigal Son in the Goſpel, ſaid, <hi>I will ariſe and
go to my Father, and ſay, I have ſinned,</hi> before the Indulgent
Father did receive or Cloath him. And this is according to
the rule in the Civil Law, <hi>Si Uxor quae (Culpa ſua) receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerat
poenitentia ducta ad virum rediens nolit admitti, eam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunc
Culpa purgatur in virum transfundit' tenebitur quae ipſi
ſeorſum habitanti alimenta praeſtare.</hi> So that the wife ought
to be a Penitentiary before the husband is bound to receive
her, or give her any maintenance. And no ſuch thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
or is found in the Verdict in our caſe.</p>
                  <p>Its ſaid by my Brother <hi>Twiſden:</hi> Although the wife departs
from her husband, yet ſhe continues his wife, and ſhe ought
not to ſtarve. If a woman be of ſo haughty a ſtomack, that
ſhe will chuſe to ſtarve, rather then ſubmit, and be reconciled
to her husband, let her take her own choiſe. The Law is in
no default, which doth not provide for ſuch a wife. If a man
be taken in execution, and lye in Priſon for Debt, neither the
Plaintiff at whoſe ſuit he is arreſted, nor the Sheriff who
took him is bound to find him Meat, Drink or Cloathes; but
he muſt live on his own, or on the Charity of others; and
if no man will relieve him, let him dye in the name of God,
ſays the Law; <hi>Plow. 68. Dive &amp; Manningham,</hi> ſo ſay I; if
a woman who can have no Goods of her own to live on, will
depart from her husband againſt his will, and will not ſubmit
her ſelf unto him, let her live on Charity, or ſtarve in the
name of God; for in ſuch caſe the Law ſays, her evil demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
brought it upon her, and her death ought to be imputed
to her own wilfulneſs. As to my Brother <hi>Tyrrells</hi> Objection,
it were ſtrange if our Law, which gives relief in all caſes,

wife to another Law, but leaving the caſe to its proper Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction;
the caſe being of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conuſance.</hi> Is it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62849:72"/>
any ſtrangeneſs or diſparagement to the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> to ſend
a Cut-purſe, or other Felon taken in the Court, to the Kings-Bench
to be Indicted? or to the Kings-Bench, to ſend a
woman to the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> to recover her Dower? Why is
it more ſtrange for the Common Law to ſend a Woman to the
Ordinary to determine differences betwixt her and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
touching matters of Matrimony, then for our Courts
at Common Law to write unto the Ordinary to certifie <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of Marriage, Baſtardy,</hi> or the like, where Iſſue is joined
on theſe points in the Kings Courts? for although the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and proceſs in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts be in the
names of the Biſhops, yet theſe Courts are the Kings
Courts, and the Law by which they proceed is the Kings
Law: 5 <hi>Rep. 39. Caudries caſe,</hi> but the reaſon in both

As in temporal cauſes, the King by the mouth of his Iudges
in his Courts of Iuſtice, determines them by the temporal
Law, ſo in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual (the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance
whereof belongs not to the Common Law) they are
decided and determined by the Eccleſiaſtical Iudges, according
to the Kings Eccleſiaſtical Laws; And that cauſes of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and the differences between husband and wife touching
Alimony, or maintenance for the wife (which are dependant
upon, or incident unto Matrimony) are all of Eccleſiaſtical,
and not of ſecular Conuzance, is evident by the Books and
Authorities of our Laws, <hi>de cauſa Teſtamentari ſicut nec de

                  <p>But 'tis objected by my Brother <hi>Tyrrell</hi> and <hi>Twiſden,</hi> that
the remedy in the Eccleſiaſtical Court is not ſufficient: for
if the husband will not obey the Sentence of the Ordinary,
it is but Excommunication for his Contumacy, and will
neither feed nor cloath the wife. Are the Cenſures of the
holy Mother the Church, grown of ſo little Accompt with us,
or the ſeparation, <hi>a communione fidelium,</hi> become ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as to be ſlighted, with <hi>but Excommunication?</hi> hath our
Law provided any remedy ſo penal, or can it give any Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo fearful as this? With us the rule is, <hi>committitur
Mareſcal',</hi> or <hi>Priſon' de Fleet.</hi> There the Sentence is, <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
Satanae,</hi> which Iudgment is more penal. Take him Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
till he pay the Debt, or take him Devil till he obey the
Church. And yet their Iudgment is warranted by the rule
of <hi>St. Paul, whom I have delivered unto Satan, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5.
whereupon the Coment ſays, <hi>Anathema ab ipſo Chriſti cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore

fo.</hi> 146. He which by the Renunciation is rightfully cut off
from the Vnity of the Church, and Excommunicate, ought
to be taken by the whole multitude as a Heathen and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,
until he be openly reconciled by Penance. <hi>Act 33. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'

our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>dic' Eccleſiae; And if he neglect to hear

Society of Chriſtians, cut off from the body of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as a Heathen and Publican, for not allowing main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to his wife, when the Church enjoyns him ſo to do;
and ſhall not this be accounted a ſufficient remedy for the
wife? I fear it is the want of Religion, and due credence
to the Cenſures of the Church, which occaſions this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rather then real want of ſufficient remedy in Law for her
relief.</p>
                  <p>The laſt matter to be anſwered, is rather the Opinion of
my Brother <hi>Twiſden</hi> and <hi>Tyrrell</hi> in their arguments, then an
Objection in this caſe; namely, if an Action upon the caſe
doth not lye againſt the husband upon the Contract of the
wife for neceſſary Apparel, yet an Action of Trover and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
doth lye againſt him for the Stuff; and ſo one way or
other the husband muſt pay the reckoning. If the Law
ſhould be ſo, it were a Converſion with a witneſs, for then
the husband ſhould ſeem to be <hi>ſub poteſtate foeminae:</hi> he might
glory in the words of <hi>St. Paul, I would have you know, that
the head of the woman is the man.</hi> But if the wife ſhall ſet
his cap, or lay his headſhip in the Gaol, it ſhall not be in the
power of the husband to prevent or avoid it: one kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
between husband and wife is, when Action of Treſpaſs
is brought againſt them, and the husband only appears, and
Proceſs iſſue out againſt the wife, until ſhe be waived and
outlawed, ſhe can never purchaſe her pardon, or reverſe the
outlawry, unleſs the husband will appear; ſo that if the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
pleaſe he is divorced, 14 <hi>H. 6. 14. a.</hi> If the wife be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed
by erronious Proceſs, and the husband will not bring a
Writ of Error, he may by this way be rid of a Shrew, and
that doth countervail a Divorce, 18 <hi>E. 4. 4. a.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe books it appears, that the Law puts a power in
the husband to be rid of his wife, and provides a remedy to
tame a Shrew; but I never heard before, that the Law hath
left it in the power of the wife to do ſo by her husband; and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62849:74"/>
I do not remember that my Brothers did vouch any Authority,
or give any reaſon for maintenance of their Opinions; and
therefore I may with freedom deny the Law to be as they
have ſaid: beſides, the nature of an Action of Trover proves
that it lies not in this caſe. The count is, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
was poſſeſſed of ſuch Goods, (and names them) as of
his own proper Goods, and caſually left them; that the Goods
came to the Defendants hands by finding, yet he knowing
them to belong to the Plaintiff, refuſeth to deliver them to
him, but hath converted them to his own uſe; ſo that an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is grounded upon a wrong ſuppoſed to be done by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
in converting the Goods of the Plaintiff knowingly
to his own uſe, againſt the will of the Plaintiff: and that
is the reaſon why the Plaintiff in that Action, muſt prove a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Goods, and an actual Converſion by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
or elſe he fails in the Action.</p>
                  <p>In an Action of the Caſe, for that the Defendant did find
the Goods of the Plaintiff, and delivered them to perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<hi>Non deliberavit modo &amp; forma,</hi> is no Plea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſaying <hi>Not-guilty,</hi> where the thing reſts in Feaſance;
and if the Action be, that the Plaintiff was poſſeſſed, <hi>Ut
de bonis propriis,</hi> and the Defendant did find and convert
them to his own uſe: It is no plea that the Plaintiff was
not poſſeſſed, <hi>Ut de bonis propriis,</hi> but he muſt plead <hi>Not-guilty</hi>
to the misdemeanour, and give the other matter in
Evidence, 33 <hi>H. 8. &amp; Mar. Bro. Action ſur le caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Trover</hi> the Plaintiff declares, that he was poſſeſſed of
ſuch Goods, and caſually left them, and the Defendant
found them, and converted them to his own uſe, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
did plead, that the Plaintiff did gage the Goods unto
him for 10 <hi>l.</hi> and that he detained the Goods for 10 <hi>l.</hi> this
is no Plea; but he ought to plead <hi>Not-guilty,</hi> and give this
matter in Evidence; for the Action doth ſuppoſe a wrong,
which the Defendant ought to anſwer, 4 <hi>E. 6. Action ſur le
caſe</hi> 113. What wrong is done to the Plaintiff in our caſe,
when he himſelf ſells and delivers the Goods? It is not
like the caſe where two men by mutual conſent, Wraſtle or
play at Football together, will an Action of Aſſault and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
lye for the one againſt the other, when the act is done by
their mutual agreement before hand? Put the caſe of Sale
made to a man upon credit, and the <hi>Vendee</hi> promiſeth to pay
for the Goods at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> but fails to pay the money ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62849:74"/>
ſhall the Saleſman have Trover againſt the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi>
becauſe he pays not the money at the day? and will the
Sale to this <hi>Feme Covert,</hi> alter the caſe, or the Law, as to
the Action? its true, that for a Converſion by the woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Coverture, or by the wife during the Coverture, an Action
of <hi>Trover</hi> lies againſt the husband and wife; but that is for
a Converſion by wrong, when ſhe takes the Goods, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
them againſt the will of the owner, 1 <hi>Cro. 10. 254. Remis
&amp; Humfrey's caſe;</hi> as in caſe where a man comes to buy
Goods, and offers 10 <hi>l.</hi> for them, and the owner agreés to
accept the money, whereupon the buyer takes the Goods away
without payment or delivery by the owner, there an Action of
Treſpaſs or <hi>Trover</hi> lies, notwithſtanding the bargain, 21
<hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. otherwiſe it is if they agree upon a price, and the
<hi>Vendor</hi> takes the <hi>Vendee's</hi> word for payment, and delivers
the Goods unto him; there the <hi>Vendor</hi> is put to his Action
for the money upon the Contract, and ſhall not bring Trover
for the Goods, 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 22.</p>
                  <p>If an Infant give or ſells Goods, and delivers them with
his own hand, he ſhall have no Action of Treſpaſs againſt
the <hi>Donee</hi> or <hi>Vendee,</hi> by reaſon of the delivery, 21 <hi>H. 7. 39.
26 H.</hi> 8. 2. but if an Infant give or ſell Goods, and the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
or <hi>Donee</hi> takes them by force of the gift or ſale, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
may have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt him. So in our
caſe: If a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> takes Wares of a Shop-keeper
againſt his will, upon pretence of buying them, an Action
lies againſt the husband; but if the owner ſell the Goods
to the wife upon truſt, and delivers the Goods unto her, he
ſhall not have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt the husband, by
reaſon of this delivery. If a man take my wife and cloath
her, this amounts unto a gift of the Apparel unto her, 11
<hi>H.</hi> 4. 83. and I may take my wife with the Apparel, and no
Action lies againſt me: by the ſame reaſon, when a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
Stuff, or other Wares to my wife, knowing her to be
a <hi>Femé Covert,</hi> to make Apparel, without my privity or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
this ſhall be conſtrued to be a gift of the Stuff unto
her, and I ſhall not be charged in any Action for it; beſides,
conſider the inconveniencies which will follow, if an Action of
<hi>Trover</hi> ſhould be againſt the husband: for then the husband
ſhall be barred of all thoſe helps which my Brothers, (who
maintain that Opinion) have allowed unto him, and have
made reaſons, for which an Action of the caſe ſhould lye
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62849:75"/>
againſt him on the Contract; namely, the Iurors are to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
and ſet the price or value, and the neceſſity and fitneſs
of things, with relation to the degree of the husband, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
care is taken, that the husband have no wrong; for in an
Action of Trover, the Iury cannot examine any of thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
but are to enquire only of the property of the Plaintiff,
and the Converſion by the Defendant, and to give damages
according to the value of the Goods: and ſo it ſhall be in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the wife to take up what ſhe pleaſeth, and to have what ſhe
liſts without reference unto the degrée or reſpect to the Eſtate of
her husband, and he ſhall be charged with it <hi>nolens volens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is objected, that the Iury is to judge what is fit for the
Wives degrée, that they are truſted with the reaſonableneſs
of the price, and are to examine the value; and alſo the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of the things or Apparel. Alas, poor man! what a
Iudicature is ſet up here to decide the private differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
husband and wife, the Wife will have a Velvet Gown,
and a Satten Petticoat, the husband thinks Mohair or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon
for a Gown, and watered Tabby for a Petticoat, is
as faſhionable, and fitter for his quality; The husband ſays,
that a plain Lawn Gorget of 10 <hi>s.</hi> pleaſeth him, and ſuits
beſt with his condition, the Wife will have a Flanders Lace,
or pointed Handkerchief of 40 <hi>l.</hi> and takes it up at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.
A Iury of Mercers, Silk-men, Sempſters, and
Exchange-men, are very excellent, and very indifferent
Iudges to decide this controverſie; It is not for their avail
and ſupport to be againſt the wife, that they may put off their
brayded Wares to the wife upon truſt, at their own price,
and then ſue the husband for the money. Are not a Iury of
Drapers and Milliners bound to favour the Mercer or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change-men
to day, that they may do the like for them to
morrow?</p>
                  <p>And beſides, what matter of Fact (and of that only the
Law hath made Iurors the Iudges) is there in the fitneſs of the
Commodities with reference to the degree of the husband?
and whether this or that thing be the moſt neceſſary for the
wife? The matter of Fact is, to find that the wife wanted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Apparel, and that ſhe bought ſuch and ſuch Wares of
the Plaintiff, at ſuch a price, to cloath her ſelf, and leaves the
fitneſs of the one, and the reaſonableneſs of the other, to the
Court: for that is matter of Law, whereof the Iurors have
no Conuſance. Leſſée for life of a Houſe, puts his Goods
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62849:75"/>
therein, makes his Executors, and dies; whoſoever hath the
Houſe after his death, yet his Executors ſhall have frée <hi>Entry,
Egreſs</hi> and <hi>Regreſs</hi> to carry their Teſtators Goods out of the
Houſe by reaſonable time, <hi>Litt.</hi> 69. And this reaſonable time
ſhall be adjudged by the diſcretion of the Iuſtices before whom
the cauſe depends, upon the true ſtate of the matter, and
not by the Iury, <hi>Co. ſuper Littleton 56. b.</hi> So it is in caſe
of Fines for Admittance, Cuſtoms and Services, if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
be, whether the ſame be reaſonable or not; for reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
belongs to the knowledge of Law, 4 <hi>Rep. 27.
Hubarts caſe.</hi> Leſſée for life makes a Leaſe for years, and dies
within the term, in an Action of Treſpaſs brought by the firſt
Leſſor againſt the Leſſeé for years, he ought by his Plea to ſet
forth what day his Leſſor dyed, and at what place, where the
Land lies, and at what day he did leave the poſſeſſion, and ſo
leave it to the diſcretion of the Court, whether he did quit the
poſſeſſion in reaſonable time or not, 22 <hi>E. 4. 18. Soinors caſe.</hi> The
fitneſs or neceſſary of Apparel, and the reaſonableneſs of the
price, ſhall be judged by the Court upon the circumſtance of
the matter, as the ſame appears by the Pleadings, or is found
by the Iury; but the Iurors are not Iudges thereof. Again,
there is a twofold neceſſity, <hi>neceſſitas ſimplex, vel abſoluta,</hi>
and <hi>neceſſitas qualificata, vel convenientiae;</hi> of a ſimple or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
neceſſity in the caſe of Apparel or Food for a Feme Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
the Law of the Land takes notice, and provides reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for the wife, if the husband refuſe or neglect to do it. But
if it be only <hi>neceſſitas convenientiae,</hi> whether this or that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,
this or that meat or drink be moſt neceſſary, or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for any wife, the Law makes no perſon Iudge thereof,
but the husband himſelf; and in thoſe caſes no man is to put
his hand betwéen the bone and the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude the general queſtion, or firſt point, with the
Iudgment of <hi>Sr. Thomas Smith</hi> in his book of the Common-wealth
of <hi>England, lib. 1. cap. 11. fo.</hi> 23. The naturalleſt,
and firſt conjunction of two towards the making a further
Society of continuance, is of the husband and wife, each
having care of the Family, the man to get, to travel abroad,
to defend; the wife to ſave, to ſtay at home and diſtribute
that which is gotten for the nurture of the Children and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
is the firſt and moſt natural but primate apparence of
one of the beſt kind of Common-wealths, where not one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
but ſometime, and in ſome things, another bears
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62849:76"/>
rule: which to maintain, God hath given to the man greater
wit, better ſtrength, better courage to compell the woman to
obey, by reaſon or force, and to the woman beauty, fair
Countenance, and ſweet words to make the man obey her
again for love. Thus each obeyeth, and commandeth the
other, and they two together rule the Houſe, ſo long as they
remain together in one. I wiſh with all my heart, that the
women of this age would learn thus to obey, and thus to
command their husbands: ſo will they want for nothing that
is fit, and theſe kind of Fleſh-flies ſhall not ſuck up or devour
their Husbands Eſtates by illegal tricks.</p>
                  <p>I am come now to this particular caſe, as it ſtands before
us on this Record. Admit that the husband were chargeable
by Law by the Contract of his wife, yet Iudgment ought to
be given againſt the Plaintiff, upon this Declaration, as this
Verdict is found;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Declaration is, That the Defendant was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to the Plaintiff in 90 <hi>l.</hi> for Wares and Merchandizes
by the Plaintiff to him before that time ſold and delivered;
and the Verdict finds, that the Wares were not ſold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the Defendant, but the ſame were ſold to his wife
without his privity or conſent. So it appears, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
hath miſtaken his Action upon the caſe, for Wares ſold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and ought to have declared ſpecially, according to
the truth of his caſe, for Wares ſold to his wife for neceſſary
Apparel. In an Action of Battery againſt the Husband and
Wife, the Plaintiff counted that they both did Aſſault and
beat him. Vpon <hi>Not-guilty</hi> pleaded, the Iury found, that
the Wife alone did make the Aſſault, and not the Husband;
<hi>Yel. 106. Darcy &amp; Deniers caſe:</hi> and the Verdict was againſt
the Plaintiff, becauſe now the Plaintiffs Action appeared to
be falſe; for the Husband ought not to be joined but for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
and there is a ſpecial Action for the Plaintiff in that
caſe: ſo this Verdict is againſt the caſe, becauſe it appears,
that the Action brought by him is falſe, and that he ought to
have brought another Action upon the ſpecial matter of his caſe,
if any ſuch by Law lye for him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Iury find, that the Defendants wife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from him againſt his will, and lived from him, and
that the Defendant, before the Wares were ſold to his wife,
did forbid the Plaintiff to truſt his wife with any Wares.
And that the Plaintiff, contrary to his Prohibition, did ſell
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62849:76"/>
and deliver thoſe Wares to the wife upon credit; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that this Prohibition doth ſo far bar, or bind the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,
that he ſhall never have any Action againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
for Wares ſold and delivered to his wife, after he was
prohibited by the husband. It is agreéd by all, that a <hi>Feme
Covert</hi> cannot generally make any Contract, which ſhall
charge or diſcharge her husband, without the authority or
conſent of the husband, precedent or ſubſequent: ſo that the
authority or conſent of the husband, is the foundation or
ground which makes the contract good againſt him: but
when the husband forbids a particular perſon to truſt his wife,
this Prohibition is an abſolute Revocation or Countermand
as to the perſon of the general authority which the wife had
before, and puts him in the ſame plight as if the wife had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any authority given her.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid by my Brother <hi>Twiſden</hi> and <hi>Tyrrell,</hi> that the
Prohibition of the husband is void, for (ſays <hi>Tyrrell)</hi> the
husband is bound to maintain his wife, notwithſtanding her
departure from him, and therefore he cannot prohibit others
to do it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Twiſden</hi> ſays it is a right veſted in her by the Law,
and therefore the Prohibition of the husband ſhall not deveſt,
or take it away from her.</p>
                  <p>I have already anſwered and diſproved theſe reaſons, on
which they ground their Opinions, and will not repeat
them here again: but admit that the husband were by
Law bound to maintain his wife, notwithſtanding her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from him againſt his will, and that the Law
doth give her, or veſt a right in the wife to bind or charge
the husband by her Contract for neceſſary Apparel; will
this be a good conſequence thereupon; Therefore the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
cannot forbid this or that particular perſon to truſt his
wife?</p>
                  <p>A man makes a Feoffment in Fée, upon condition that
the Feoffee ſhall not Alien, this Condition is void, <hi>Litt.
Sect.</hi> 360. Were it not a ſtrange concluſion to ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon;
If a man maks a Feoffment in Fée, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the Feoffee ſhall not Alien to <hi>J. S.</hi> that this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is likewiſe void?</p>
                  <p>The reaſon given by <hi>Littleton,</hi> why the Condition is
void in the former, and not in the later part of this ſecond
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62849:77"/>
caſe, is applicable to our caſe; namely, the Condition in
the firſt caſe ouſts the Feoffee of all the power which the
Law gives unto him, which ſhould be againſt reaſon, and
therefore the ſame is void; but in the latter caſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
doth not take away all the power of Aliening from
the Feoffee; and therefore it is good: ſo in our caſe, if
the Prohibition were ſo general, that the wife were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
diſabled altogether to Cloath her ſelf, peradventeur it
might be reaſonable to ſay, that the Prohibition was void;
but it being a reſtriction only to one particular perſon, there
is no colour to ſay, that it is not good.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true (as my Brother <hi>Tyrrell</hi> ſays) that I cannot
diſcharge others to deal with my wife, although I may
forbid my wife to deal with them; but it follows not
thereupon, but that my Prohibition to a particular perſon
doth make his dealing with, or truſting my wife, to be at his
own peril, ſo that he ſhall not charge me thereby in an
Action; as in caſe of a Servant, who buys Proviſion for
my Houſhold by my allowance; If I forbid a Butcher or
other Victualler, to ſell to my Servant without ready
money, and he delivers meat to my Servant afterwards
upon truſt, it is at his peril, he ſhall have no Action againſt
me for it.</p>
                  <p>It appears not by this Declaration or Verdict, that the
Defendants Wife did want Apparel, that ſhe ever deſired
her husband to ſupply her therewith, that he refuſed to
allow her what was fit, that the Wares ſold to her by
the Plaintiff, were for neceſſary Apparel, or of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or price the Wares were; ſo that the Court may
Iudge of the neceſſity or fitneſs thereof: but only that
the Plaintiff did ſell and deliver upon credit divers of
the Wares mentioned in the Declaration unto the wife
(whereas none are mentioned therein) for 43 <hi>l.</hi> that this
was a reaſonable price for theſe Wares, and the ſame
Wares were neceſſary for her, and ſuitable to the degree
of her husband, and for theſe reaſons the Defendant
ought to have Iudgment in this particular caſe againſt
the Plaintiff, be the Law what it will in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will conclude all, as the ſeven Princes of</hi> Perſia <hi>(who
knew Law and Iudgments) did in the caſe of Queen</hi>
Vaſthi, Eſther 1 Ca. This Deed that this woman
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62849:77"/>
hath done, in departing from her husband againſt his will,
and taking of Clothes upon truſt, contrary to his Prohibition,
ſhall come abroad to all women; and if it ſhall be repeated
that her husband (by the Opinion of the Judges) muſt pay
for the Wares which ſhe ſo took up, whilſt ſhe lived from
him, then ſhall their husbands be deſpiſed in their Eyes.
But when it ſhall be known throughout the Realm, that
the Law doth not charge the husband in this caſe, all the
Wives ſhall give to their Husbands honour, both great
and ſmall.</p>

                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury's</hi> Counſel prayed that the Retorn
might be Filed, and it was ſo; And <hi>Friday</hi> following ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

to the Retorn; and my Lord was remanded till that

                  <p>And on <hi>Friday</hi> the Earl was brought into Court again,
and his Counſel argued the inſufficiency of the Retorn.

                  <p>The cauſe of his Commitment (which is retorned) is not
ſufficient, for the general allegation, of high Contempts, is
too uncertain; for the Court cannot judge of the Contempt,
if it doth not appear in what act it is. Secondly, It is not
ſhewed where the Contempt was committed, and in favour
of Liverty it ſhall be intended they were committed out of the
Houſe of Peers. Thirdly, The time is uncertain, ſo that
peradventure it was before the laſt Act of general Pardon,
1 <hi>Roll</hi> 192, 193. and 219. <hi>Ruſſells caſe.</hi> Fourthly, It doth
not appear whether this Commitment were on a Conviction,
or an Accuſation only; It cannot be denied, but that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn
of ſuch Commitment by any other Court, would be too
general and uncertain. <hi>Moore 839. Aſtwick</hi> was bailed on a
Retorn, <hi>Quod commiſſus fuit per mandatum Ni. Bacon, Mil.
Domini Cuſtodis magni Sigilli Angliae virtute cujuſdam Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt'
in Curia Cancellariae fact';</hi> and in that book it appears,
that divers other perſons were bailed on ſuch general Retorns,
and the caſes have been lately affirmed in <hi>Buſhells</hi> caſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
by the Lord Chief Iuſtice <hi>Vaughan,</hi> where it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaid (that on ſuch Commitment and Retorns, being
too general and uncertain) the Court cannot believe in an
implicite manner, that in truth the Commitment was for
cauſes particular and ſufficient: <hi>Vaughans Rep. 14. accord
2 Inſt.</hi> 52, 53, 55. and 1 <hi>Roll</hi> 218. And the Commitment of
the Iurors was for acquitting <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Mead, contra plenam
&amp; manifeſtam Evidentiam;</hi> and it was reſolved to be too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for the Evidence ought to appear as certain to the
Iudge of the Retorn, as it appeared before the Iudge autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
to Commit: <hi>Ruſſells caſe</hi> 137. Now this Commitment
(being by the Houſe of Peers) will make no difference: for
in all caſes where a matter comes in Iudgment before this
Court, let the queſtion be of what nature it will, the Court
is obliged to declare the Law, and that without diſtinction,
whether the queſtion began in Parliament or no. In the caſe
of <hi>Sir George Binion in C. B.</hi> there was a long debate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an Original might be Filed againſt a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
during the time of priviledge; and it was urged, that
it being during the Seſſions of Parliament, the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the queſtion did belong to the Parliament. But it
was reſolved, an Original might be Filed; and <hi>Bridgman</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:62849:79"/>
then being Chief Iuſtice, ſaid, That the Court was obliged
to declare the Law in all caſes that come in Iudgment before
them. <hi>Hill. 24 E. 4. Rot. 4. 7. &amp; 10. in Scacc'</hi> in Debt by

&amp;c. et eorum familiares capi ſeu arreſtari non debent, Sed
nullum habetur privilegium quod non debent implacitari, Ideo
reſpondeat ouſtr'.</hi> So in <hi>Treymiards</hi> caſe, a queſtion of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
was determined in this Court, <hi>Dyer</hi> 60. In the 14
<hi>E.</hi> 3. in the caſe of <hi>Sir John</hi> and <hi>Sir Geoffrey Staunton,</hi> (which
was cited in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and is entred
in the Lords Iournal) an Action of Waſte depended between
them in the Common-Pleas, and the Court was divided, and
the Record was certified into the Houſe of Parliament, and
they gave direction that the Iudgment ſhould be entred for the
Plaintiff. Afterwards, in a Writ of Error brought in this
Court, that Iudgment was reverſed notwithſtanding the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
That it was given by Order of the Houſe of Lords,
for the Court was obliged to proceed according to the Law
in a matter which was before them in point of Iudgment.</p>
                  <p>The conſtruction of all Acts of Parliament is given to the
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> And accordingly they have adjudged
of the Validity of Acts of Parliament. They have ſearched
the <hi>Rolls of Parliament, Hob. 109. Lord Hudſons caſe.</hi> They
have determined whether the Iournals be a Record, <hi>Hob.</hi> 110.
When a point comes before them in Iudgment, they are not
forecloſed by any Act of the Lords. If it appears that an Act
of Parliament was made by the King and Lords, without
the Commons, that is <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> and the Courts of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
do adjudge it void; 4 <hi>H. 7. 18. Hob.</hi> 111. and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
they ought to do. If this Retorn contains in it that
which is fatal to it ſelf, it muſt ſtand or fall thereby. It hath
been a queſtion often reſolved in this Court, when a Writ of
Error in Parliament ſhall be a <hi>Superſedeas.</hi> And this Court
hath determined what ſhall be ſaid to be a Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
1 <hi>Roll</hi> 29. and if the Law were otherwiſe, there would
be a failour of Iuſtice. If the Parliament were Diſſolved,
there can be no queſtion, but the Priſoner ſhould be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on a <hi>Habeas Corpas;</hi> and yet then the Court muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the cauſe of his Commitment: and by conſequence a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62849:79"/>
matter Parliamentary. And the Court may now have cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance
of the matter as clearly as when the Parliament is
Diſſolved. The party would be without remedy for his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
if he could not find it here; for it is not ſufficient for
him to procure the Lords to determine their pleaſure for his
Impriſonment, for before his enlargement he muſt obtain the
pleaſure of the King to be determined, and that ought to be
in this Court, and therefore the Priſoner ought firſt to reſort
hither.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſuppoſe (for it doth not appear on the Retorn, and
the Court ought not to enquire of any matter out of it) that
a ſuppoſed contempt was a thing done out of the Houſe, it
would be hard for this Court to remand him. Suppoſe he
were committed to a Forreign priſon during the pleaſure of
the Lords, no doubt that would have been an illegal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Petition of Right.
There the Commitment had been expreſly illegal; and it may
be this Commitment is no leſs: For if it had been expreſly
ſhewn, and he be remanded, he is committed by this Court,
who are to anſwer for his Impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, The duration of the Impriſonment, during
the pleaſure of the King and of the Houſe, is illegal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;
for ſince it ought to determine in two Courts, it
can have no certain period. A Commitment until he ſhall be
diſcharged by the Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas</hi>
is illegal; for the Priſoner cannot apply himſelf in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as to obtain a diſcharge. If a man be committed till
further Order, he is bailable preſently; for that imports till
he ſhall be delivered by due courſe of Law, and if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
have not that ſenſe, it is illegal; for the pleaſure of
the King is that which ſhall be determined according to Law
in his Courts; as where the Statute of <hi>Weſtm' 1. cap.</hi> 15.
declares, that he is not repleviſable, who is taken by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the King, it ought to extend to an extrajudicial
command, not in his Courts of Iuſtice, to which all matters
of Iudicature are delegated and diſtributed, 2 <hi>Inſt. 186,
187.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wallop</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; he cited <hi>Buſhells caſe, Vaug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han's
Rep.</hi> 137. that the general Retorn for high Contempts
was not ſufficient; and the Court that made the Commitment
in this caſe, makes no difference; for otherwiſe one may be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62849:80"/>
impriſoned by the Houſe of Peers unjuſtly for a matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievable
here, and yet ſhall be out of all relief by ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn;
for upon a ſuppoſition, that this Court ought not to
meddle where the perſon is committed by the Peers, then
any perſon, at any time, and for any cauſe, is to be ſubject to
perpetual Impriſonment at the pleaſure of the Lords. But
the Law is otherwiſe; for the Houſe of Lords is the ſupream
Court, yet their Iuriſdiction is limited by the Common and
Statute Law; and their exceſſes are examinable in this Court;
for there is great difference betwéen the errors and exceſſes of
a Court, betwéen an erroneous proceéding, and a proceeding
without Iurisdiction, which is void, and a meer nullity; 4 <hi>H.
7.</hi> 18. In the Parliament, the King would have one Attaint
of Treaſon, and loſe his Lands, and the Lords aſſented,
but nothing was ſaid of the Commons; wherefore all the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
held that it was no Act, and he was reſtored to his
Land; and without doubt in the ſame caſe, if the party had
been impriſoned, the Iuſtices muſt have made the like reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he ought to have been diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>It is a Solleciſm, that a man ſhall be impriſoned by a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Iurisdiction; and it ſhall not be examinable whether the
cauſe were within their Iurisdiction or no. If the Lords
without the Commons ſhould grant a Tax, and one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to pay it ſhould be impriſoned, the Tax is void; but by
a general Commitment the party ſhall be remedileſs: So if
the Lords ſhall award a <hi>Capias</hi> for Treaſon or Felony: By
theſe inſtances it appears, that their Iurisdiction was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by the Common Law; and it is likewiſe reſtrained
by divers Acts of Parliament, 1 <hi>H. 4. cap. 14. No Appeals
ſhall be made, or any way purſued in Parliament.</hi> And when
a Statute is made, a power is implicitely given to this Court
by the fundamental conſtitution, which makes the Iudges
Expoſitors of Acts of Parliament. And peradventure if all
this caſe appeared upon the Retorn, this might be a caſe in
which they were reſtrained by the <hi>Statute 4 H. 8. cap.</hi> 8. That
all Suits, Accuſements, Condemnations, Puniſhments, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
&amp;c. at any time from henceforth to be put or had upon
any Member for any Bill, ſpeaking or reaſoning of any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
concerning the Parliament to be communed or treated of,
ſhall be utterly void and of none effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:62849:80"/>
Now it doth not appear but this is a correction or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
impoſed upon the Earl contrary to the Statute; There
is no queſtion made now of the power of the Lords; but it
is only urged, that it is neceſſary for them to declare by virtue
of what power they proceed; otherwiſe the Liberty of every
Engliſhman ſhall be ſubject to the Lords, whereof they may
deprive any of them againſt an Act of Parliament; but no
uſage can juſtifie ſuch a proceeding. <hi>Elliſmeres caſe</hi> of the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,
19. The Duke of Suffolk</hi> was impeached by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of High Treaſon and Misdemeanors, the Lords were
in doubt whether they would proceed on ſuch general Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to impriſon the Duke; And the advice of the Iudges
being demanded, and their reſolutions given in the negative,
the Lords were ſatisfied; This caſe is mentioned with deſign
to ſhew the reſpect given to the Iudges, and that the Iudges
have determined the higheſt matters in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>At a conference between the Lords and Commons 3 <hi>Aprilis,
Car.</hi> 1. concerning the Rights and Priviledges of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
It was declared and agreed, that no Freeman ought to
be reſtrained or committed by command of the King, or Privy-Council,
or any other (in which the Houſe of Lords are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded)
unleſs ſome cauſe of the Commitment, Reſtraint
or Deteynor be ſet forth for which by Law he ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
&amp;c. Now if the King (who is the Head of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament)
or his Privy Council (which is the Court of
State) ought therefore to proceed in a legal manner; this
ſolemn reſolution ought to end all Debates of this matter.
It is true, 1 <hi>Roll 129. in Ruſſells caſe. Coke</hi> is of Opinion,
that the Privy-Council may commit without ſhewing cauſe;
but in his more mature age he was of another Opinion: And
accordingly the Law is declared in the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and
no inconvenience will enſue to the Lords by making their
Warrants more certain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Smith</hi> argued to the ſame purpoſe, and ſaid, That a Iudge
cannot make a Iudgment, unleſs the Fact appears to him on
a <hi>Habeas Corpus:</hi> the Iudge can only take notice of the Fact
retorned. It is lawful for any Subject that finds himſelf
agrieved by any Sentence or Iudgment, to Petition the King
in an humble manner for Redreſs; And where the Subject is
reſtrained of his liberty, the proper place for him to apply
himſelf to, is this Court; which hath the ſupreme power, as
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62849:81"/>
to this purpoſe, over all other Courts; and an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi>
iſſuing here, the King ought to have an accompt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<hi>Roll tit. Habeas Corp. 69. Wetherlies caſe.</hi> And alſo
the Commitment was by the Lords; yet if it be illegal, this
Court is obliged to diſcharge the Priſoner, as well as if he
had been illegally impriſoned by any other Court. The Houſe
of Peers is an high Court, but the Kings-Bench hath ever
been entruſted with the Liberty of the Subject, and if it were
otherwiſe (in caſe of Impriſonment by the Peers) the
power of the King were leſs abſolute, than that of the
Lords.</p>
                  <p>It doth not appear but that this Commitment was for
breach of priviledge; but nevertheleſs if it were ſo, this
Court may give relief, as appears in <hi>Sir John Benions</hi> caſe
before cited; for the Court which hath the power to judge
what is Priviledge, hath alſo power to judge what is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
againſt Priviledge. If the Iudges may judge of an
Act of Parliament, <hi>a fortiori</hi> they may judge of an Order of
the Lords, 12 <hi>E. 1. Butlers caſe,</hi> where he in Reverſion
brought an Action of Waſt, and died before Iudgment, and
his Heir brought an Action for the ſame Waſt; and the King
and the Lords determined that it did lye, and commanded the
Iudges to give Iudgment accordingly for the time to come;
this is publiſhed as a Statute by <hi>Poulton,</hi> but in <hi>Ryley</hi> 93.
it appears, that it is only an Order of the King and the
Lords, and that was the cauſe that the Iudges conceived that
they were not bound by it, but 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. and ever ſince have
adjudged the contrary.</p>
                  <p>If it be admitted, that for breach of Priviledge the Lords
may commit, yet it ought to appear on the Commitment,
that that was the cauſe; for otherwiſe it may be called a
breach of priviledge, which is only a refuſing to anſwer to an
Action, whereof the Houſe of Lords is reſtrained to hold plea
by the Statute 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. And for a Contempt committed out of
the Houſe they cannot commit; for the word <hi>Appeal</hi> in the
Statute extends to all Misdemeanors, as it was reſolved by
all the Iudges in the Earl of <hi>Clarendons caſe, 4 Julii,</hi> 1663.</p>
                  <p>If the Impriſonment be not lawful, the Court ought not
to remand to his wrongful Impriſonment, for that would be
an act of Injuſtice to impriſon him <hi>de novo; Vaughan,
156.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:62849:81"/>
It doth not appear whether the Contempt was a voluntary
act, or an omiſſion, or an inadvertency, and he hath now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
five months Impriſonment. Falſe Impriſonment is not
only where the Commitment is unjuſt, but where the deteynor
is too long, 2 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 53.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe, if this Court cannot give remedy, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Impriſonment ſhall be perpetual; for the King (as
the Law is now taken) may Adjourn the Parliament for <hi>ten
or twenty years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all this is upon ſuppoſition, that the Seſſion hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;
but I conceive that by the Kings giving his Royal
Aſſent to ſeveral Laws which have been enacted, the Seſſion
is determined; and then the Order for the Impriſonment is
alſo determined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brook, tit. Parliament</hi> 36. Every Seſſion in which the King
ſigns Bills, is a day of it ſelf, and a Seſſion of it ſelf. 1 <hi>Car.
1. cap.</hi> 7. A ſpecial Act is made, that the giving of the Royal
Aſſent to ſeveral Bills, ſhall not determine the Seſſion; 'tis
true, 'tis there ſaid to be made for avoiding all doubts. In
the Statute 16 <hi>Car. 1. cap.</hi> 1. there is a <hi>Proviſo</hi> to the ſame
purpoſe. And alſo 12 <hi>Car. 2. cap. 1. 11. R. 2. H.</hi> 12. By the
Opinion of <hi>Coke 4 Inſt.</hi> 27. the Royal Aſſent doth not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
a Seſſion; but the Authorities on which he relies do
not warrant his Opinion. For 1. In the Parliament Roll
1 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. it appears, that the Royal Aſſent was given to the
Act for the Reverſal of the Attainder of the Members of
Parliament the ſame day that it was given to the other
Bills; and in the ſame year, the ſame Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
again; and then it is probable the Members who
had been attainted, were preſent, and not before; 8 <hi>R. 2. n.</hi> 13
is only a Iudgment in caſe of Treaſon, by virtue of a power
reſerved to them on the Statute 25 <hi>E. 3. Roll Parliament (7)
H. 4. n.</hi> 29. and is not an Act of Parliament, 14 <hi>E. 3. n. 7,
8,</hi> 9. the Aid is firſt entred on the Roll, but upon condition
that the King will grant their other Petitions. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> makes, that the Act for the Attainder of
Queen <hi>Katherine, 33 H.</hi> 8. was paſſed before the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Seſſion, is an Error; for though ſhe was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
during the Seſſion, yet it was on a Iudgment given
againſt the Queen by the Commiſſioners of <hi>Oyer and Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
and the ſubſequent Act was only an Act of Confirmation;
but <hi>Coke</hi> ought to be excuſed, for all his Notes and Papers
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62849:82"/>
were taken from him; ſo that this book did not receive his
laſt hand: But it is obſervable, that he was one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament, 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. when the ſpecial Act was
paſſed. And afterwards the Parliament did proceed in that
Seſſion only, where there was a precedent agreement betwixt
the King and the Houſes. And ſo concluded, that the Order
is determined with the Seſſion, and the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi>
ought to be diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> argued to the ſame effect, and ſaid, that the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
is not ſufficient; for it doth not appear that it was made
by the Iurisdiction that is exerciſed in the Houſe of Peers;
for that is <hi>coram Rege in Parliamento:</hi> So that the King and
the Commons are preſent in ſuppoſition of Law. And the
Writ of Error in Parliament is, <hi>Inſpecto Recordo, nos de
Conſilio, adviſamento Dominorum Spiritual' &amp; Temporalium
&amp; Commun' in Parliament', praed' exiſten', &amp;c.</hi> It would not
be difficult to prove, that anciently the Commons did aſſiſt
there: And now it ſhall be intended that they were preſent;
for there can be no averment againſt the Record. The Lords
do ſeveral acts as a diſtinct Houſe; as the debating of Bills,
enquiring of Franchiſes and Priviledges, &amp;c. And the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in this caſe (being by the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
cannot be intended otherwiſe, but it was done by them
in their diſtinct capacity: And the Commitment being during
the pleaſure of the King and of the Houſe of Peers, it is
manifeſt that the King is principal, and his pleaſure ought to
be determined in this Court.</p>
                  <p>If the Lords ſhould Commit a great Miniſter of State,
whoſe advice is neceſſary for the King and the Realm, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be imagined that the King ſhould be without remedy for
his Subject, but that he may have him diſcharged by his Writ
out of this Court.</p>
                  <p>This preſent receſs is not an ordinary Adjournment: for it
is entred in the Iournal, that the Parliament ſhall not be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
at the day of Adjournment, but adjourned or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued
till another day, if the King do not ſignifie his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
by Proclamation.</p>
                  <p>Some other exceptions were taken to the Retorn.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That no Commitment is retorned, but only a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to the Conſtable of the Tower to receive him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62849:82"/>
Secondly, The Retorn does not anſwer the mandate
of the Writ; for it is to have the body of <hi>Anthony
Earl of Shaftesbury,</hi> and the Retorn is of the Warrant
for the impriſonment of <hi>Anthony Aſhly Cooper Earl of
Shaftesbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maynard</hi> to maintain the Retorn. The Houſe of Lords
is the ſupream Court of the Realm; 'Tis true, this Court
is ſuperiour to all Courts of ordinary Iurisdiction: If this
Commitment had been by any inferiour Court, it could not
have been maintained. But the Commitment is by a Court
tht is not under the comptroll of this Court, and that Court
is in Law ſitting at this time; and ſo the expreſſing of the
Contempt particularly, is matter which continues in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
of the Court: 'Tis true, this Court ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what the Law is in every caſe that comes before
them; and in this caſe, the queſtion is only, whether this
Court can judge of a Contempt committed in Parliament
during the ſame Seſſion of Parliament, and diſcharge one
committed for ſuch Contempt? When a queſtion ariſes in an
Action depending in this Court, the Court may determine it;
but now the queſtion is, whether the Lords have capacity to
determine their own priviledges; and whether this Court
can comptroll their determination, and diſcharge (during the
Seſſion) a Peer committed for Contempt. The Iudges
have often demanded what the Law is, and how a Statute
ſhould be expounded of the Lords in Parliament, as in the
<hi>Statute of Amendments, 40 E. 3. 84. 6. 8. Co. 157, 158. a
fortiori</hi> the Court ought to demand their Opinion when a
doubt ariſes on an Order made by the Houſe of Lords now
ſitting.</p>
                  <p>As to the duration of the Impriſonment, doubtleſs the
pleaſure of the King is to be determined in the ſame Court
where Iudgment was given. As alſo to the determination
of the Seſſion, the Opinion of <hi>Coke</hi> is good Law, and the
addition of <hi>Proviſo's</hi> in many Acts of Parliament, is only <hi>in
majorem cautelam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jones Attorney General,</hi> to the ſame effect. As to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of the Commitment, it is to be conſidered, that
this caſe differs from all other caſes in two circumſtances;
Firſt, the perſon, that is a Member of the Houſe, by which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62849:83"/>
he is committed. I take it upon me to ſay, that the caſe
would be different if the perſon committed were not a <hi>Peer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Court that doth commit: which is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Court to this Court; and therefore if the Contempt
had been particularly ſhewn, of what Iudgment ſoever this
Court ſhould have been as to that Contempt, yet they could
not have diſcharged the Earl, and thereby take upon them a
Iurisdiction over the Houſe of Peers. The Iudges in no age
have taken upon them the Iudgment of what is <hi>Lex &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudo
Parliamenti;</hi> but here the attempt is to engage the
Iudges to give their Opinion in a matter whereof they might
have refuſed to have given it, if it had been demanded in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
This is true, if an Action be brought where pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
is pleaded, the Court ought to judge of it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to the Suit, whereof the Court was poſſeſſed: but
that will be no warrant for this Court to aſſume a Iudgment
of an original matter ariſing in Parliament. And that which
is ſaid of the Iudges power to expound Statutes, cannot be
denied; but it is not applicable in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame reaſon that this Commitment is queſtioned,
every Commitment of the Houſe of Commons may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
queſtioned in this Court.</p>
                  <p>It is objected, That there will be a failer of Iuſtice, if the
Court ſhould not diſcharge the Earl; but the contrary is true,
for if he be diſcharged, there would be a manifeſt failer of
Iuſtice; for Offences of Parliament cannot be puniſhed any
where but in Parliament; and therefore the Earl would be
delivered from all manner of puniſhment for his Offence, if
he be diſcharged: For the Court cannot take Bail but where
they have a Iurisdiction of the matter, and ſo delivered out
of the hands of the Lords, who only have power to puniſh
him.</p>
                  <p>It is objected, That the Contempt is not ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the Houſe of Peers; but it may well be intended to
be committed there; for it appears he is a Member of that
Houſe, and that the Contempt was againſt the Houſe. And
beſides, there are Contempts whereof they have cognizance,
though they are committed out of the Houſe.</p>
                  <p>It is objected, That it is poſſible this Contempt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
before the general pardon; but ſurely ſuch Injuſtice
ſhould not be ſuppoſed in the ſupream Court; and it may well
be ſuppoſed to be committed during the Seſſion in which the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62849:83"/>
Commitment to Priſon was. It would be great difficulty
for the Lords to make their Commitments ſo exact and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
when they are imployed in the various affairs of the
Realm; and it hath been adjudged on a Retorn out of the
Chancery of a Commitment for a Contempt againſt a Decreé,
that it was good, and the Decrée was not ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>The limitation of the Impriſonment is well; for if the
King or the Houſe determine their pleaſure, he ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged:
for then it is not the pleaſure of both that he ſhould
be detained; and the addition of theſe words (during the
pleaſure) is no more than was before imply'd by the Law:
for if theſe words had been omitted, yet the King might have
pardoned the Contempt, if he would have expreſſed his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
under the Broad Seal. If Iudgment be given in this
Court, that one ſhould be impriſoned during the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
his pleaſure ought to be determined by Pardon, and not
by any act of this Court. So that the King would have no
prejudice by the Impriſonment of a great Miniſter, becauſe he
could diſcharge him by a Pardon; the double limitation is for
the benefit of the Priſoner, who ought not to complain of the
duration of the Impriſonment, ſince he hath neglected to make
application for his diſcharge in the ordinary way.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs by the determination of the Seſſion, the Orders
made the ſame Seſſion are diſcharged; but I ſhall not affirm
whether this preſent Order be diſcharged or no, becauſe it is a
Iudgment: but this is not the preſent caſe; for the Seſſion
continues notwithſtanding the Royal Aſſent given to ſeveral
Bills, according to the Opinion of <hi>Cooke,</hi> and of all the
Iudges, <hi>Hutton</hi> 61, 62. Every <hi>Proviſo</hi> in an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not a determination what the Law was before; for
they are often added for the ſatisfaction of thoſe that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Winington Solicitor General,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; In the
great caſe of <hi>Mr. Selden 5 Car.</hi> 1. the Warrant was for nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Contempts committed againſt us and our Government,
and ſtirring up Sedition; and though that be almoſt as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
as in our caſe, yet no objection was made in that cauſe in
any of the arguments, <hi>Ruſhworths Collections</hi> 18, 19. in the
Appendix. But I agree, that this Retorn could not have béen
maintained, if it were of an inferiour Court; but during the
Seſſion this Court can take no cognizance of the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:62849:84"/>
And the inconveniency would be great, if the Law were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
taken, for this Court might adjudge one way, and the
Houſe of Peers another way; which doubtleſs would not be
for the advantage or liberty of the Subject; for the avoiding
of this miſchief, it was agreed by this whole Court in the caſe
of <hi>Barnadiſton and Soames,</hi> that the Action for the double Retorn
could not be brought in this Court, before the Parliament had
determined the right of the Election, leſt there ſhould be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the Iudgments of the two Courts.</p>
                  <p>When a Iudgment of the Lords comes into this Court,
(though it be of the reverſal of a Iudgment of this Court)
this Court is obliged to execute it; but the Iudgment was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
examined or corrected here. In the caſe of my <hi>Lord Hollis</hi>
it was reſolved, that this Court hath no Iurisdiction of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour
commited in the Parliament; when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is determined, the Iudges are Expoſitors of the Acts,
and are intruſted with the lives, liberties and fortunes of the
Subjects: And (if the Seſſions were determined) the Earl
might apply himſelf to this Court; for the Subject ſhall not
be without place where he may reſort for the recovery of his
liberty; but this Seſſion is not determined. For the moſt
part the Royal Aſſent is given the laſt day of Parliament;
as ſaith <hi>Plow. Partridges caſe.</hi> Yet the giving of the Royal
Aſſent doth not make it the laſt day of the Parliament, without
a ſubſequent Diſſolution or Prorogation. And the Court Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially
takes notice of Prorogations or Adjournments of
Parliament, <hi>Cro. Jac. 111. Ford <hi>verſus</hi> Hunter.</hi> And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
by the laſt Adjournment, no Order is diſcontinued,
but remains as if the Parliament were actually aſſembled,
<hi>Cro. Jac. 342. Sir Charles Heydon's caſe;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Earl</hi>
ought to apply himſelf to the Lords who are his proper
Iudges.</p>
                  <p>It ought to be obſerved, that theſe Attempts are <hi>primae Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſionis;</hi>
and though Impriſonments for Contempts have
been frequent by the one and the other Houſe, till now no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ever ſought enlargement here.</p>
                  <p>The Court was obliged in Iuſtice to grant the <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi>
but when the whole matter being diſcloſed, it appears
upon the Return, that the caſe belongs <hi>ad aliud examen,</hi> they
ought to remand the party.</p>
                  <p>As to the limitation of the Impriſonment, the King may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
his pleaſure by Pardon under the Great Seal, or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62849:84"/>
for his diſcharge under the Privy Seal, as in the caſe of
<hi>Reniger &amp; Fogaſſa, Plow.</hi> 20.</p>
                  <p>As to the Exception, that no Commitment is returned, the
Conſtable can only ſhew what concerns himſelf, which is the
Warrant to him directed; and the Writ doth not require him
to return any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the Exception, that he is otherwiſe named in the
Commitment then in the Writ, the Writ requires the body
of <hi>Anthony Earl of Shaftesbury, quocunque nomine Cenſeatur</hi>
in the Commitment.</p>
                  <p>The Court delivered their Opinion; and firſt <hi>Sir Thomas
Jones Juſtice</hi> ſaid, ſuch a Retorn made by an ordinary
Court of Iuſtice, would have been ill and uncertain; but the
caſe is different when it comes from this high Court, to which
ſo great reſpect hath been paid by our Predeceſſors, that they
deferred the determination of doubts conceived in an Act of
Parliament, until they had received the advice of the Lords in
Parliament. But now inſtead thereof, it is demanded of us
to comptroll the Iudgment of all the Peers given on a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their own Houſe, and during the continuance of the
Seſſion. The caſes where the <hi>Courts of Weſtminſter</hi> have
taken cognizance of Priviledge, differ from this caſe; for in
thoſe it was only an incident to a caſe before them which was
of their cognizance; but the direct point of the matter now, is
the Iudgment of the Lords.</p>
                  <p>The courſe of all Courts ought to be conſidered; for that
is the Law of the Court, <hi>Lane's caſe 2 Rep.</hi> And it hath not
been affirmed that the uſage of the Houſe of Lords hath been
to expreſs the matter more punctually on Commitments for
Contempts; And therefore I ſhall take it to be according to
the courſe of Parliament, 4 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 50. it is ſaid, that the Iudges
are Aſſiſtants to the Lords to inform them of the Common
Law, but they ought not to judge of any Law Cuſtom or
uſage of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The objection as to the continuance of the Impriſonment,
hath received a plain anſwer; for it ſhall be determined by the
pleaſure of the King, or of the Lords; and if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
yet the King could pardon the Contempt under the
Great Seal, or diſcharge the Impriſonment under the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Seal. I ſhall not ſay what would be the conſequence
(as to this Impriſonment) if the Seſſion were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62849:85"/>
for that is not the preſent caſe; but as the caſe is,
this Court can neither Bail nor diſcharge the Earl.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wyld Juſtice,</hi> The Retorn no doubt is illegal; but the
queſtion is on a point of Iurisdiction, whether it may be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
here; this Court cannot intermeddle with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of the high Court of Peers in Parliament during the
Seſſion, which is not determined; and therefore the certainty
or uncertainty of the Retorn is not material, for it is not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
here; but if the Seſſion had béen determined, I ſhould
be of Opinion that he ought to be diſcharged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rainsford Chief Juſtice,</hi> This Court hath no Iurisdiction
of the cauſe, and therefore the form of the Retorn is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable;
we ought not to extend our Iurisdiction beyond its
due limits, and the Actions of our Predeceſſors will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
us in ſuch Attempts; The conſequence would be very
miſchievous, if this Court ſhould deliver the Members of the
Houſes of Peers and Commons who are committed; for
thereby the buſineſs of the Parliament may be retarded; for
perhaps the Commitment was for evil behaviour, or undecent
Reflections on the Members, to the diſturbance of the affairs
of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Commitment in this caſe is not for ſafe cuſtody, but
he is in Execution on the Iudgment given by the Lords for the
Contempt; and therefore if he be bailed, he will be delivered
out of Execution; becauſe for a Contempt <hi>in facie Curiae,</hi> there
is no other Iudgment or Execution. This Court hath no Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of the matter, and therefore he ought to be reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
And I deliver no Opinion, if it would be otherwiſe in
caſe of Prorogation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twiſden Juſtice</hi> was abſent; but he deſired <hi>Juſtice Jones</hi> to
declare, that his Opinion was, that the party ought to be
remanded.</p>
                  <p>And ſo he was remanded by the Court.</p>

<hi>Meſne</hi> Conveyances a Title was deduced to the Heir of
the Plaintiff; <hi>Ralph</hi> had Iſſue <hi>Robert</hi> the Defendant. And
in this ſpecial Verdict the queſtion was, If any Vſe did ariſe
to <hi>Ralph</hi> by this Indenture 23 <hi>Jan' 21 Jac'? Hales, Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
and <hi>Wyld,</hi> (againſt the Opinion of <hi>Twiſden) Michael
Mitford</hi> took an Eſtate for life by implication and conſequence,
and ſo had an Eſtate Tail. <hi>Hales (1)</hi> ſaid it were clear if
an Eſtate for life had been limited to <hi>Michael,</hi> and to the
Heirs males of the body of <hi>Michael,</hi> to be begotten on the
body of his ſecond wife; that had been an Eſtate Tail.
(2) Which way ſoever it be, the Eſtate is lodged in <hi>Michael</hi>

Eſtates to be conveyeyed by the rules of the Common Law,

according to the intention of the party, which was, that

a groat for every Inſtrument that had been read in the
cauſe: the Client pretended that he ought to have but 4 <hi>d.</hi>
for all. They gave Sentence for the Defendant; the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
appealed, and then a Prohibition was prayed in the Court
of Kings Bench. The Opinion of the Court was, that the
Libell for his Fees was moſt proper for the Spiritual Court:
but that becauſe the Plaintiff there demanded a cuſtomary
Fee, that it ought to be determin'd by Law, whether ſuch a
Fee were cuſtomary or no: and accordingly they granted a
Prohibition in that caſe. It is like the caſe of a <hi>modus</hi> for
Tythes: for whatever ariſeth out of the cuſtom of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
is properly determinable at Common Law. But in

ought not to be prohibited: and therefore granted a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,

of temporal cogniſance, but not as to the ſuit for Fees.
<hi>Wyndham</hi> ſaid, if there had been an actual Contract upon the

thought a Prohibition ought to go for the whole. Fées, he ſaid,
had no relation to the Iurisdiction of the Spiritual Court, nor

to be ſuffered in the Spiritual Court, when the Plaintiff has
a remedy at Law: as here he might in an Action upon the

made after the Writ of <hi>Audita querela</hi> purchaſed, and before
the Declaration. The Court ſaid, if <hi>Tatnell</hi> had only
brought an Action on the caſe againſt the Sheriff, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
damages for the eſcape, though he had had the damages
paid, that would not have béen ſufficient ground for the Plaintiff
here to bring an <hi>Audita querela;</hi> but in this caſe he recovered
his Original debt in an Action of debt grounded upon the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape,
which is a ſufficient ground of Action, if he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
well. They gave day to ſhow cauſe, why the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhould not be amended, paying Coſts.</p>

                  <p>AN Action of <hi>Falſe Impriſonment.</hi> The Defendants juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
by vertue of a Warrant out of a Court within the
County Palatine of <hi>Durham;</hi> to which the Plaintiff demur'd.
The material part of the Plea was, That there was <hi>antiqua
Curia tent. coram Vicecomite Comitatus, &amp;c. vocat.</hi> The
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:62849:91"/>
County Court, which was accuſtomed to be held <hi>de 15 diebus
in 15 dies,</hi> and that there was a Cuſtom, that upon a Writ
of <hi>queſtus eſt nobis,</hi> iſſuing out of the County Palatine of
<hi>Durham,</hi> and delivered to the Sheriff, &amp;c. that upon the
Plaintiffs affirming <hi>quandam querelam</hi> againſt ſuch perſon or
perſons, againſt whom the <hi>queſtus eſt nobis</hi> iſſued, the Sheriff
uſed to make out a Writ in the nature of a <hi>cap. ad ſatisfac.</hi>
againſt him or them, &amp;c. that ſuch a Writ of <hi>queſtus eſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi>
iſſued <hi>ex Cur' Cancellarii Dunelm.</hi> which was delivered to
the Sheriff, who thereupon made a precept to his Bayliffs to
take the Plaintiff, who thereupon was arreſted, which is the
ſame impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Jones</hi> for the Plaintiff, took exceptions to this plea;
as, 1. The Court is ill pleaded to be held <hi>coram Vicecomite;</hi>
for in a County Court the ſuitors are Iudges: <hi>Cr. Jac.</hi> 582.
and though this Court holdeth plea upon a <hi>queſtus eſt nobis,</hi>
which is the Kings Writ; yet that doth not alter the nature
of the Court, nor its Iurisdiction. <hi>Jentleman's caſe, 6 Rep. 11.
2.</hi> The Cuſtom of holding this Court <hi>de quindecem diebus in
quindecem dies,</hi> is void: being not only againſt <hi>Magna Cart.
35.</hi> but againſt the 2 <hi>&amp; 3 Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 25. which enacts,
<hi>That no County Court, &amp;c. ſhall be longer deferred then one
month from Court to Court, &amp;c. any Uſage, Cuſtom, Statute
or Law to the contrary notwithſtanding.</hi> 3. He took theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
to the Cuſtom; 1. It is abſurd, that if upon a <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
eſt nobis,</hi> the party affirm <hi>quandam querelam,</hi> that then, &amp;c.
for a <hi>queſtus eſt nobis</hi> is an Action upon the caſe, and this <hi>quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
querela</hi> may be in any other Action, though never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote:
the plaint ought to be in purſuance of the Writ, and ſo
to have been pleaded. 2. As this Cuſtom is laid, it does not
appear, that the plaint ought to ariſe within the Iurisdiction of
the Court. 3. It is againſt the Law, that in any inferiour
Court a <hi>Capias</hi> ſhould be awarded before Summons. 1 <hi>Rolls
563. Seaburn &amp; Savaker. 2 Rolls 277. placit' 2. Paſch. 16 Jac.
Bankes &amp; Pembleton.</hi> The <hi>4th</hi> exception to the Declaration
was, that it does not appear whether this Writ were purchaſed
out of the Chancery of the City of <hi>Durham,</hi> or of that of the
County: the words <hi>ex Cur. Cancellar. Dunelm.</hi> are applicable
to either. 5. Here is not an averment, that the cauſe of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did ariſe within the County Palatine: it is ſaid indeed,
that he was endebted, and did aſſume within the County; but
it is the contract and cauſe of the debt that entities the Court
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:62849:92"/>
there to the Action. 6. He ſays, that he did <hi>levare quandam
querelam;</hi> but does not ſay that it was <hi>ſuper brevi de queſtus
eſt nobis:</hi> nor that it was <hi>in placito praedict';</hi> nor makes any
application at all of the plaint to the Writ: and then the plaint
not appearing to be warranted by the Writ, and being for
above 40 ſhillings, the proceedings are <hi>coram non Judice.
7.</hi> The Sheriffs Warrant is to Arreſt, <hi>ſi inventus
fuerit in balliva tua:</hi> and it does not appear that the Bayliff
had any Bayliwick. If the County were divided into ſeveral
diviſions, and each Bayliff allotted to a ſeveral diviſion, this
ought to have been ſhown; and that the place where this Arreſt
was made, was within this Bayliffs proper diviſion. 8. Of
the Defendants own ſhowing, the Court was not held accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Cuſtom alledged, <hi>viz. de quindecim diebus in 15
dies:</hi> for the laſt Court is ſaid to have been held the <hi>12th</hi> of
<hi>March,</hi> and the next after that on the <hi>26th. Turner</hi> for the
Defendant argued, that the impriſonment was lawful. To the
firſt exception he ſaid, that the Court mention'd in the bar, is
not a County-Court, nor ſo pleaded: it is pleaded as it is,
<hi>Cur' vocat. Cur' Comitat';</hi> and there were never any Suitors
known there to be Iudges. It is not to be examined accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the rules of County Courts properly ſo called: for we
plead it to be according to the Cuſtom of the County Palatine
of <hi>Durham,</hi> which is an exempt Iurisdiction. As for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to its being held <hi>de 15 diebus in 15 dies,</hi> the anſwer to
the firſt exception anſwers this alſo. The Iudges of <hi>Aſſize</hi> in
Writs of falſe Iudgment have allowed this Cuſtom, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
Iudgments given in this Court: of which we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Preſidents. For the third exception, concerning the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of the Cuſtom; to the firſt exception againſt it, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that a Bar is good enough, if it be to a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and the common intent is, that the <hi>quaedam querela</hi> muſt
be purſuant to the <hi>queſtus eſt nobis:</hi> and in this caſe it was
ſo; the <hi>queſtus eſt nobis,</hi> and the precept upon which the
Plaintiff was arreſted, are both in an Action of the caſe upon
a promiſe. And to the ſecond, that the cauſe of Action is ſhown
to ariſe within the Iurisdiction; for the promiſe, which is the
ground of this Action, is ſaid to have been made <hi>infra Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.
Palatin.</hi> To the third exception, that in inferiour Courts
it is illegal to award a <hi>Capias</hi> before Summons; but this
Court is in a County Palatine; and ſuch Courts are like to
the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and have the ſame Authority: <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landſon
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:62849:92"/>
landſon &amp; Sympſon, 1 Rolls 801. placito</hi> 11. and the Cuſtoms
of thoſe Courts are as good Warrants for their proceedings,
as the Cuſtom of the Kings Bench is for their iſſuing <hi>Latitats.</hi>
To the fourth, he ſaid it was a forreign intendment, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Court of Chancery in the City of <hi>Durham;</hi> a Court
of Equity cannot be by grant, and there is no preſcription in
the City of <hi>Durham,</hi> to hold plea in Equity. To the fifth, he
ſaid, the promiſe was laid to have beén made within the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
To the ſixth, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> To the ſeventh, that this
Precept was according to the form of all their Precepts in like
caſes. To the eigth, that taking both days incluſively, there
are 15 days. But admitting that there were ſome defect in
the proceedings, yet ſince that Court can iſſue ſuch a Writ as
this is, it is ſufficient to excuſe the Officer: 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> the caſe
of the Marſhalſey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cur'.</hi> This is not a County Court, but a Court <hi>vocat' Cur'
Com',</hi> and it is within a County Palatine; and for both thoſe
reaſons not in the ſame degree with other County Courts.
And though it were a County Court, it might by preſcription
be held before the Sheriff, as a Court Baron may by a ſpecial
preſcription be held <hi>coram Seneſchallo,</hi> and ſo it hath béen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged:
in the caſe of <hi>Armyn &amp; Appletoft, Cr. Jac.</hi> 582. there
is no ſuch ſpecial preſcription as there ought to be, but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
preſcription for a Court Baron, and every Court Baron
muſt be preſcribed for. The County Palatine of <hi>Durham</hi> is
not of late ſtanding, like that of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> but is immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial:
and a Cuſtom there is of great Authority. As to the
objection againſt <hi>quandam querelam;</hi> why it may not be as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
for a man there to bring a <hi>queſtus eſt nobis,</hi> and declare
in what plaint he will, as it is here to arreſt a man and declare
againſt him in any Action? But admitting the proceedings
irregular, yet ſince the Court can iſſue a <hi>Capias,</hi> that excuſes
the Officer in this Action: and Iudgment was given for the
Defendant, <hi>Niſi cauſa, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>THe Plaintiff declared as Executor againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants,
as Executors alſo; they pleaded ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<hi>plene adminiſtravit.</hi> Vpon one of the Iſſues
a Special Verdict was found; <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſaid
Defendant being Executor <hi>durante min' aetate</hi> of an Infant,
had paid ſuch and ſuch Debts and Legacies, and had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over <hi>totum reſiduum ſtatus perſonalis</hi> of the Teſtator,
to the Infant Executor, when he came of Age. Iuſtice <hi>Atkyns.</hi>
This ſpecial Verdict does not maintain the Defendants plea
of <hi>fully adminiſtred:</hi> for that cannot be pleaded, unleſs all
Debts, &amp;c. are diſcharged, as far as the <hi>Aſſets</hi> will reach:
which is not done here; for <hi>reſiduum ſtatus perſonalis</hi> is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over, &amp;c. and that <hi>reſiduum</hi> is lyable to the payment of
this Debt, which is yet undiſcharged. But <hi>Vaughan,
Wyndham</hi> and <hi>Ellis</hi> held, that however an Executor diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelf of the Eſtate that was the Teſtators, he may plead
<hi>fully adminiſtred:</hi> and that it is his ſafeſt plea.</p>
                  <p>It was found by the ſame Verdict, that the Teſtator left a
perſonal Eſtate, to the value of 2000 <hi>l.</hi> that there were owing
by him 500 <hi>l.</hi> in Debts upon ſpecialties, 500 <hi>l.</hi> more upon
ſimple Contracts; and that he had diſpoſed of 400 <hi>l.</hi> in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies:
and that this Defendant was Executor <hi>durante mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor'</hi>
of the Teſtators Son; that he had paid 1400 <hi>l.</hi> in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the Debts and Legacies aforeſaid; and had accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Infant Executor, when he came of age, and that
upon the payment of 91 <hi>l.</hi> to him, the Infant Executor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed
to him all Actions, &amp;c. and whether upon this whole
matter, this Defendant ſhould be ſaid to have adminiſtred,
was the queſtion?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaughan.</hi> When an Infant Executor comes of age, the
power of an Executor <hi>durante minore aetate</hi> ceaſeth; and the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62849:94"/>
new Executor is then lyable to all Actions: if the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor
waſted, the new one hath his remedy againſt him; but
he is not lyable to other mens Suits. Nor is there any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
in this; for ſtill, here is a perſon lyable to all
Actions: It is objected, that poſſibly the new Executor is not
of ability to ſatisfie: I anſwer; if in ſome particular caſe it
fall out to be ſo, that is by accident: and to argue from the
poſſibility of ſuch an accident, is to ſuppoſe the Law fitted to
anſwer all emergencies. <hi>Atkyns</hi> accorded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaughan.</hi> It is ſaid that here are 1500 <hi>l.</hi> lyable to pay this
Debt: for to pay debts upon ſimple Contracts, or Legacies
before it, is a <hi>devaſtavit;</hi> eſpecially, the Defendant having
notice of this debt (which was alſo found.) That is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
upon which ſome books run: but it is certainly no
Law. Debts upon ſimple Contracts may be paid before
Bonds, unleſs the Executors have timely notice given them
of thoſe Bonds; and that notice muſt be by Action. <hi>Atkyns</hi>
and <hi>Ellis</hi> agréed with <hi>Vaughan. Wyndham dubitabat.</hi> The caſe

                     <hi>EJectione firmae.</hi> A ſpecial Verdict: it was found that a
man by Deed did give and grant, bargain and ſell, alien,
enfeoff and confirm to his daughter certain Lands: but no
conſideration of money is mention'd, nor is the Deed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd;
there is likewiſe no conſideration of natural Affection
expreſſed (other then what's implyed in naming the Grantee
his daughter) there is no Livery endorſed, nor any found to
have been made; nor was the daughter in poſſeſſion at the
time of the Deed made. The queſtion was, whether this
were a void Deed, or had any operation at all in the Law,
and what was wrought by it? In the Kings Bench it was
adjudged by the whole Court to be a good Deed, and that it
carried the Eſtate to the daughter by way of covenant to ſtand
ſeized. Vpon a Writ of Error before the Iuſtices of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas,
and the Barons of the Exchequer, the caſe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
at Sergeants-Inn, by <hi>Sir William Jones</hi> againſt the Deed,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62849:95"/>
aud by <hi>Sir Francis Winnington</hi> in maintenance of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jones.</hi> Before the Statute of Vſes, a man might either
have retained the poſſeſſion, and have departed with the uſe,
or he might have departed with the poſſeſſion, and have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the uſe; or he might have departed with them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Statute unites the poſſeſſion to the uſe; but leaves
men at liberty to convey their Eſtates by putting the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
out of themſelves, and limiting an uſe; or by raiſing an
uſe, and let the poſſeſſion follow that. Now how ſhall it be
known when an Eſtate muſt paſs one of theſe ways, and
when the other? That muſt appear by the intention of the
party expreſſed in the Deed. Some Conveyances contain
words that look both ways; ſome one way and ſome another.
If the words look both ways, then has he, to whom the
Eſtate is intended to be conveyed, election to take it whether
way he likes beſt: <hi>Sir Rowland Heyward's caſe, 2 Rep. Adams
&amp; Steer, 2 Cr.</hi> 210. ſo in <hi>Mich. 9 Jacob.</hi> a man in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of money did grant, enfeoff, bargain and ſell; and in
the deed there was a Letter of Attorney to make Livery; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
to be a good Conveyance by way of bargain and ſale,
if the deed were enrolled: <hi>Rolls ſecond part</hi> 787. Where the
words are only proper to paſs an Eſtate by way of uſe, there
you ſhall never take an Eſtate at Common Law: <hi>Cr. Jac.
210. in Adams &amp; Steer's caſe: Denton &amp; Fettyplace's caſe. 30
Eliz.</hi> is there cited, that by the words of bargain and ſale
without attornment, a Reverſion paſſeth not. <hi>Vide ibid. 50.
Dr. Atkyns caſe:</hi> The King bargains and ſells, &amp;c. no uſe
can riſe, becauſe the King cannot ſtand ſeized to an uſe:
<hi>Moor</hi> 113. On the other ſide, where the words are proper to
paſs the Eſtate at Common Law, there nothing ſhall paſs by
way of uſe: <hi>Dyer 302. b.</hi> a <hi>quaere</hi> is there made, whether or
no, if a man, in conſideration of natural affection, &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
to his brother, who is not in poſſeſſion; whether an uſe
hereby ariſeth to the releſſee? but this <hi>Quaere</hi> is reſolved in a
manuſcript Report that I have of that caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That no uſe
does ariſe. He cited <hi>Ward &amp; Lambert's caſe: Cr. Eliz. 394.
&amp; Osburn &amp; Churchman's caſe, Cr. Jac.</hi> 127. which is the caſe
in queſtion. In <hi>Rolls ſecond part, fol.</hi> a man in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of marriage did give and grant to his wife after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe,
to her and the heirs of her body, &amp;c. and it was reſolved
that nothing paſſed. This caſe is much ſtronger then ours:
for there is but one way to make this good, <hi>viz.</hi> by raiſing an
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:62849:95"/>
uſe: for as a Conveyance at Common Law, it cannot be
good, becauſe a Freé-hold cannot be granted to commence <hi>in
futuro:</hi> and yet rather then recede from the words of the
party, the deed was adjudged to be void. He cited <hi>Foſter &amp;
Foſter's caſe, Trin.</hi> 1659. which himſelf had argued. In the
deed here in queſtion there are words proper to paſs an Eſtate
in poſſeſſion; <hi>give and grant.</hi> There is likewiſe a clauſe of
warranty; of which the Grantee ſhould loſe the benefit in a
great meaſure, if he were in the <hi>Poſt;</hi> for then he ſhall not
vouch: and there are Opinions that he cannot rebut; as in
<hi>Spirt &amp; Bence's caſe.</hi> There is alſo a Covenant, that after the
ſealing and delivery, and <hi>due execution of, &amp;c.</hi> the party ſhall
quietly enjoy, &amp;c. now, what execution can be meant, but by
<hi>Livery of ſeiſin? Foxe's caſe, 8 Rep.</hi> has been objected, in
which it is reſolved, that the Reverſion in that caſe ſhould paſs
by way of bargain and ſale, though the words of grant were,
<hi>demiſe, grant, ſet and to Farm let;</hi> all words proper to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law-Conveyance:
I anſwer, the conſideration of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
there expreſſed, is ſo ſtrong a conſideration, as to carry it
that way; but the conſideration of natural Affection is not ſo
ſtrong; and ſo the caſes are not alike: the conſideration of
money has been held ſo ſtrong, as to carry an Eſtate of Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple
in an uſe, without words of Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Winnington contra.</hi> He inſiſted upon the intention of the
party, the conſideration of blood and natural affection, and the
neceſſity of making this deed good by way of Covenant to
ſtand ſeized, becauſe it could not take effect any other way.
The clauſe of warranty and covenant for quiet enjoyment, he
ſaid, were but forms of Conveyances, and words of Clerks:
but the effectual words are thoſe that contain the inducement of
the party to make the Conveyance, and the words that paſs
the Eſtate: he cited <hi>Plowd. queries placito 305. Rolls 2 part,
787. placito 25. 1 Inſt. 49. Poph. 49. in Foſters caſe,</hi> which
had been cited againſt him, he ſaid, the deed was as unformal
to paſs the Eſtate one way as another. <hi>In Osburn &amp; Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
caſe,</hi> he ſaid, this point was ſtarted; but that the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
was not upon this point: it came in queſtion neither
upon a ſpecial Verdict, nor a demurrer. <hi>Tibs &amp; Purplewell's
caſe, 40 &amp; 41 Eliz. Rolls 2 part</hi> 786, 787. anſwers all Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
againſt our caſe, and is in form and ſubſtance the ſame
with it. He cited one <hi>Saunders &amp; Savin's caſe,</hi> adjudged in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:62849:96"/>
late times in the Common-Pleas, <hi>viz.</hi> That where a man
ſeiz'd in Fee of a Rent-charge, granted it to a Kinſman for
life; and the grantor dyed before attornment, it was reſolved,
that upon the ſealing and delivery of the deed an uſe aroſe.
Wherefore he prayed that the Iudgment might be affirmed.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſix Iudges argued, 1. That in a Covenant to ſtand
ſeized, thoſe words of <hi>covenanting to ſtand ſeized to the uſe
of, &amp;c.</hi> are not abſolutely neceſſary, and that it is ſufficient
if there are words that are <hi>tantamount.</hi> 2. That no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
admits of ſuch variety of words, as does this of a
Covenant to ſtand ſeized. 3. That Iudges have always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ſupport Deeds, <hi>ut res magis valeat, &amp;c.</hi> 4. That
the grantor in this caſe by putting in plenty of words, ſhews
that he did not intend to tye himſelf up to any one ſort of
Conveyance. 5. That if the words <hi>give and grant</hi> had been
alone in the deed, there would have been no queſtion: and that
if ſo, then <hi>utile per inutile non vitiatur.</hi> 6. That every mans
deed muſt be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt himſelf. 7. That
the words <hi>give and grant</hi> enure ſometimes as a grant, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as a Covenant, ſometimes as a Releaſe: and muſt be
taken in that ſenſe which will beſt ſupport the intent of the

full determinations upon debate: and that it were a thing of
ill conſequence to admit of ſo great an uncertainty in the Law,
as now to alter it. 9. That there is here a clear intent that
the daughter ſhould have this Eſtate, a Deed, a good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thurland</hi> ſaid, The intention of the party was not a ſure
rule to conſtrue deeds by: that if Lands were given <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubio
ſoluto ab omni ſervitio,</hi> the intent of the giver is, to
make a gift in <hi>Frank-marriage;</hi> but the Common Law, that
delights in certainty, will not underſtand his words ſo, becauſe
he does not ſay, <hi>in libero maritagio:</hi> In our caſe, the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62849:96"/>
of the Father was to ſettle the Land upon his Daughter;
his ſecond intent was to do it by ſuch or ſuch a Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
what Conveyance he meant to do it by, we muſt
know by his words: the words <hi>give and grant</hi> do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and naturally work upon ſomething <hi>in eſſe:</hi> ſtrained
conſtructions are not favoured in the Law. Nor ought
Heirs to be diſinherited by forced and ſtrained conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
If this Deed ſhall work as a Covenant to ſtand
ſeized, it will be in vain to ſtudy forms of Conveyances;
it is but throwing in words enough, and if the Lands
paſs not one way, they will another. He cited <hi>Crook 279.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaughan accordant.</hi> It is not clear that the words <hi>give
and grant</hi> are ſufficient to raiſe an uſe; but ſuppoſing that
they are by a forced Expoſition, when nothing appears to the
contrary; will it thence follow that they may be taken in a
ſenſe directly contrary to their proper and genuine ſenſe, in
ſuch a place as this, where all the other parts of the deed are
wholly inconſiſtent with, and will not by any poſſibility admit
of ſuch a conſtruction? he mentioned ſeveral clauſes in the
deed, which he ſaid were proper only to a Conveyance at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law. He appealed to the Law before the Statute of
Vſes; and ſaid, that where an uſe would not riſe by the
Common Law, there the Statute executes no poſſeſſion:
and that by ſuch a deed as this no uſe would have riſen at the
Common Law: but the Iudgment was affirmed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>FOrmedon in the Remainder.</hi> The caſe was thus: There
were three Siſters; the eldeſt was Tenant in Tail of a
fourth part of 140 Acres, &amp;c. in thrée Villes, <hi>A. B. &amp; C.</hi> the
Remainder in <hi>Fee-ſimple</hi> to the other two: the Tenant in
Tail takes Husband <hi>Dr. Doble</hi> the Defendant. The Husband
and Wife levy a Fine <hi>ſur coniſance de droit,</hi> to the uſe of them
two, and the heirs of the body of the Wife, the Remainder
in Fee to the right Heirs of the Husband: and this Fine was
with warranty againſt them and the heits of the wife. The
wife dies without iſſue, living the Husband, againſt whom
<hi>Lucy</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> the other two Siſters, to whom the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in Feé was limited, bring a <hi>Formedon in the Remainder.</hi>
The Defendant, as to part of the Lands in demand, <hi>viz.</hi> 100
Acres, pleaded <hi>Non-tenure,</hi> and that ſuch a one was Tenant.
To that plea the Plaintiff demurred. As to the reſt of the
Lands, he pleaded this Fine with warranty. The Plaintiffs
made a frivolous replication, to which the Defendants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murred.
The Plaintiffs Councel excepted to the Defendants
plea of <hi>Non-tenure:</hi> 1. That he does not expreſs in which of
the Villes the 100 Acres lie: 5 <hi>Ed. 3. 140. in the old Print,
184. &amp; 33 H. 6. 51. Sir John Stanley's caſe.</hi> But this was
over-ruled: for the Formedon being of ſo many ſeveral Acres,
he is not obliged to ſhew where thoſe lie, that he pleads <hi>Non-tenure</hi>
of: he tells the Plaintiff who is the Tenant, which is
enough for him. 2. Becauſe he that pleads <hi>Non-tenure</hi> in
abatement, ought to ſet forth who was Tenant <hi>die impetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis
brevis orig. &amp;c.</hi> But this was over-ruled alſo; for he ſays
that himſelf was not Tenant <hi>die impetrationis brevis origin.</hi>
but that ſuch another <hi>eodem die</hi> was <hi>Tenant;</hi> which is certain
enough. When the Tenant pleads <hi>Non-tenure</hi> to the whole,
he needs not ſet forth who is Tenant; otherwiſe when he
pleads <hi>Non-tenure</hi> of part: 11 <hi>H. 4. 15. 33 H.</hi> 6. 51. At the
Common Law, if the Tenant had pleaded <hi>Non-tenure</hi> as to
part, it would have abated all the Writ: 36 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 6. but by
the Statute of the 25 <hi>Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 16. it was enacted, that by
the exception of <hi>Non-tenure</hi> of parcel, no Writ ſhould be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but only for that parcel, whereof the <hi>Non-tenure</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
A third exception was taken to the pleading of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62849:98"/>
Fine, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he pleaded a Fine levied of a fourth part,
without ſaying in how many parts to be divided. This was
alſo over-ruled, and 1 <hi>Leon.</hi> 114. was cited; where a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is taken betwixt a Writ and a Fine: and in a Fine it is
ſaid to be good, that being but a common aſſurance, <hi>aliter</hi> in
a Writ: 19 <hi>Ed. 3. Fitz. br<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e</hi> 244. This exception ſeems le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel'd
againſt the Plaintiffs own Writ, in which he demands
a fourth part, without ſaying in how many parts to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The matter in Law was, whether or no this warranty,
being againſt the husband and wife, and the heirs of the wife,
were a bar to the Plaintiffs, or ſurvived to the Husband? and
it was reſolved to be a bar; for this warranty as to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
was deſtroyed as ſoon as it was created: the ſame
breath that created it put an end to it: for the Husband war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
during his life only, and took back as large an Eſtate
as he warranted; which deſtroys his warranty: and this is
<hi>Littleton's</hi> Text: if a man make a feoffment in Feé with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,
and take back an Eſtate in Fee, the warranty is gone.
But the deſtruction of the husbands warranty does not affect
the wives: 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. and <hi>Sym's caſe;</hi> upon which <hi>Ellis</hi> ſaid,
he much relyed. <hi>Herberts caſe 3 Rep.</hi> can give no rule here;
for that here the husband is ſeiz'd only in right of the wife.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vaughan</hi> ſaid, That if the Fine in this caſe had beén levied
to a ſtranger for life, or in Fée who had béen impleaded by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtranger; that in that caſe the Tenant ought to have
vouched the ſurviving husband, as well as the heir of the
wife, or elſe he would have loſt his warranty. 2. He ſaid, if
the Fine had been levied to the uſe of a ſtranger, who had
been impleaded by the heirs of the wife, he queſtioned
whether or no the Tenant could have rebutted them for
any more then a moity: and he queſtioned the reſolution
of <hi>Sym's caſe 8 Rep.</hi> there is a Caſe cited in <hi>Symme's caſe</hi> out
of the 45 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 23. which is expreſly againſt the reſolution of
the caſe: it is ſaid in the Reports, that no Iudgment was
given in that caſe, which is falſe; and that the caſe is not
well abridged by <hi>Brook,</hi> which is alſo falſe. If in caſe of a
voucher, a man loſeth his warranty, that does not vouch all
that are bound; why ſhould not one that's rebutted have the
like advantage? There is a reſolution quoted in <hi>Sym's caſe</hi>
out of 5 <hi>Edw. 2. Fitz. tit. garranty</hi> 78 upon which the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſaid to be founded, being, as is there ſaid, a caſe in
point; but he conceived not: for <hi>Harvey,</hi> that gave the rule,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62849:98"/>
ſaid; <hi>le tenant poit barrer vous touts, ergo un ſole:</hi> in the
caſe there were ſeveral co-heirs, and if all were demandants,
all might have been barred; and if one be demandant, there's
no queſtion but ſhe may be rebutted for her part. But <hi>Sym's
caſe</hi> is quite otherwiſe: for there one perſon is co-heir to the
garranty, that is not heir to any part of the Land. In 6 <hi>Ed.
3.</hi> 50. there is a caſe reſolved upon the ground and reaſon of
the 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. for theſe reaſons he ſaid, he could not rely upon
<hi>Sym's caſe.</hi> He agreed with the reſt to the reaſon why the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
is deſtroyed, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the husband takes back as
great an Eſtate as he warranted: for then no uſe can be made
of the warranty. If a man that has Land, and another,
warrant this Land to one and his heirs: and one of them die
without heirs, the ſurvivor may be vouched without queſtion.
The husband never was obliged by this warranty; but as to
him it was meerly nominal: for from the very creation of it,
it was impoſſible that it ſhould be effectual to any purpoſe:
he cited <hi>Hob. 124. in Rolls &amp; Osburn's caſe.</hi> The whole Court
agreeing in this Opinion, Iudgment was given for the
Tenant.</p>

that the Fact ſworn againſt them was in Law a Riot: which

the Sheriffs Bayliff executes the Writ upon the Inteſtates
Goods in her hands. Vpon this <hi>Serjeant Baldwin</hi> moved the
Court for Reſtitution: for that a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> is a Commiſſion,
and muſt be ſtrictly purſued. Now the words of the Writ are
<hi>de bonis</hi> of <hi>John Brooks:</hi> and by his death they ceaſe to be his
Goods. The Plaintiff will be at no prejudice; the Goods
will ſtill remain lyable to the Iudgment; only let the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
be renewed by <hi>Scire facias,</hi> to which the Adminiſtratreſs
may plead ſomewhat. <hi>Wyndham.</hi> The property of the Goods
is ſo bound by the <hi>Teſte</hi> of the Writ, as that a Sale made of
them <hi>bona fide</hi> ſhall be avoided: which is a ſtronger caſe. And
ſince the Inteſtate himſelf could not have any plea, why
ſhould we take care that the Adminiſtrator ſhould have time to
plead? And of that Opinion was all the Court, after they
had adviſed with the Iudges of the Kings Bench: who infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them that their practice was accordingly. But <hi>Vaughan</hi>
faid, that in his Opinion it was clearly againſt the rules of

                     <hi>EJect' firmae.</hi> The caſe upon a ſpecial Verdict was thus, <hi>viz.
Sir Rich. Saltingſtone</hi> being ſeized in Fee of <hi>Rees-Farm,</hi> on
the <hi>17th day of Febr', in the 19th year</hi> of the King, made his Will
in writing, in which were theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>Rees-Farm</hi> in ſuch
a place, I will and bequeath it to my Wife during her natural
life: <hi>and by her to be diſpoſed of to ſuch of my Children
as ſhe ſhall think fit: Sir Richard</hi> dyed: his Wife entred and
ſealed ſuch a Writing as this, <hi>viz. Omnibus Chriſti fidelibus,
&amp;c. Noveritis,</hi> that whereas my Husband <hi>Sir Richard Salting-stone,
&amp;c. reciting that clauſe in the Will:</hi> I do diſpoſe the
ſame in manner following; that is to ſay, I diſpoſe it, after
my deceaſe, to my Son <hi>Philip</hi> and his heirs for ever. The
Wife died, and <hi>Philip</hi> entred and dyed, and left the Leſſor
of the Plaintiff his Son and heir. The queſtion was, what
Eſtate <hi>Philip</hi> took? or what Eſtate the Teſtator intended
ſhould paſs out of him? This caſe was argued in <hi>Eaſter-Term</hi>
laſt paſt, by <hi>Serjeant Scroggs</hi> for the Plaintiff; and by <hi>Serjeant
Waller</hi> for the Defendant: and in <hi>Trinity-Term</hi> by <hi>Serjeant
Baldwin</hi> for the Plaintiff, and <hi>Serjeant Newdigate</hi> for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant.
They for the Plaintiff inſiſted upon the word <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;</hi>
that when a man deviſeth his Land to be diſpoſed by a
ſtranger, it has been always held to be a bequeathing of a Feé-ſimple,
or at leaſt a power to diſpoſe of the Fee-ſimple. 19 <hi>H.
8. 10. Moor 5 Eliz. 57. per Dyer, Weſton &amp; Welſhe:</hi> but
they chiefly relyed on <hi>Daniel &amp; Uply's caſe</hi> in <hi>Latch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Defendants Councel urged, that the heir at Law
ought not to be diſinherited without very expreſs words.
That if the Deviſor himſelf had ſaid in his Will, <hi>I diſpoſe
Rees-Farm</hi> to <hi>Philip;</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> would have had no more then
an Eſtate for life: and what reaſon is there, that the diſpoſal
being limited to another, ſhould carry a larger Intereſt, then
if it had been executed by the Teſtator himſelf? This Term
it was argued at the Bench, and by the Iudgments of <hi>Ellis,
Wyndham &amp; Atkyns</hi> Iuſtices, the Plaintiff had Iudgment:
they agreed that the Wife took by the Will an Eſtate for her
own life, with a power to diſpoſe of the Fee. She cannot
take a larger Eſtate to her ſelf by implication, then an Eſtate
for life; becauſe an Eſtate for life is given to her by expreſs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62849:102"/>
1 <hi>Bulſt. 219, 220. Whiting &amp; Wilkins caſe.</hi> For
caſes reſembling the caſe in queſtion were cited, 7 <hi>Ed. 6. Brook,
tit. Deviſe 39. 1 Leon. 159. &amp; Daniel &amp; Uply's caſe: &amp; Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's
caſe in Latch.</hi> It is objected that in <hi>Daniel &amp; Uply's
caſe,</hi> there are theſe words, <hi>at her will and pleaſure:</hi> to which
they anſwered, that if ſhe have a power to diſpoſe according to
her diſcretion, and as ſhe her ſelf pleaſeth; and then <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio
eorum quae tacite inſunt, nihil operatur.</hi> If I deviſe that
<hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall ſell my Land, he ſhall ſell the Inheritance: <hi>Kelloway
43, 44. 19 H. 8. fol.</hi> 9. Where the Deviſor gives to another
a power to diſpoſe, he gives to that perſon the ſame power that
himſelf had. <hi>Vaughan Chief Juſtice</hi> differed in Opinion; he
ſaid, it is plain that the word <hi>diſpoſe</hi> does not ſignifie to give,
for if ſo, then it is evident that the Leſſor of the Plaintiff
cannot have any title: for if the Wife were to give,
then were the Eſtate to paſs out of her, which could not be by
ſuch an appointment as ſhe makes here, but muſt be by
a legal Conveyance. Beſides, ſhe cannot give what ſhe has
not, and ſhe has but an Eſtate for life. If then it does not
ſignifie to give, what does it ſignifie? let us a little turn the
words, and a plain certain ſignification will appear: I will
and bequeath <hi>Rees-Farm</hi> to ſuch of my Children as my Wife
ſhall think fit, at her diſpoſal: at this rate the Wife does but
nominate what perſon ſhall take by the Will. This is a plain
caſe, and free from uncertainty and ambiguity, which elſe the
word <hi>diſpoſe</hi> will be liable to. But Iudgment was given,

                  <p>TEnant for life, the Remainder in Tail. Tenant for
life levies a Fine to <hi>J. S.</hi> and his heirs, to the uſe of
himſelf for years, and after to the uſe of <hi>Hannah</hi> and
<hi>Suſan Prinne</hi> and their heirs, if ſuch a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
were unpaid by the Conuſor, and if the money were
paid, then to the uſe of the Coniſor and his heirs. And
this Fine was with general warranty. The Tenant for
life died, the money unpaid, and the warranty deſcended upon
the Remainder-man in Tail. And the queſtion was, whether
the Remainder-man were bound by this warranty or not?
<hi>Serjeant Maynard</hi> argued, that becauſe the Eſtate of the Land
is transferred in the <hi>Poſt,</hi> before the warranty attaches in the
Remainder-man, that therefore it ſhould be no Bar. He
agréed, that a man that comes in by the limitation of an uſe
ſhall be an Aſſignee within the <hi>Statute of 32 H. 8. cap.</hi> 34. by
an equitable conſtruction of the Statute, becauſe he comes in
by the limitation of the party, and not purely by Act in Law:
but this caſe of ours is upon a collateral garranty, which is a
poſitive Law, and a thing ſo remote from ſolid reaſon and
equity, that it is not to be ſtretch'd beyond the maxime. That
the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> in this caſe ſhall not vouch, is confeſſed
on all hands: and there is the ſame reaſon why he ſhould not
rebutt. He ſaid the reſolution mentioned in <hi>Lincoln Colledge
caſe,</hi> was not in the caſe, nor could be: the warranty there
was a particular warranty, <hi>contra tunc Abbatem Weſtmonaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienſem
&amp; ſucceſſores ſuos;</hi> which Abby was diſſolved long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that caſe came in queſtion. He ſaid, <hi>Juſtice Jones</hi> upon
the arguing of <hi>Spirt &amp; Bence's caſe,</hi> reported in <hi>Cr. Car.</hi> ſaid,
that he had been preſent at the Iudgment in <hi>Lincoln Colledge
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62849:103"/>
caſe,</hi> and that there was no ſuch reſolution as is there reported.
<hi>Serjeant Baldwin</hi> argued on the other ſide: that at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law many perſons might <hi>rebutt,</hi> that could not take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of a warranty by way of <hi>Voucher:</hi> as the Lord by
Eſcheat, the Lord of a Villain, a Stranger, a Tenant in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion:
35 <hi>Aſſ. placito 9. 11 Aſſ. placito 3. 45 Ed. 3. 18. pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito
11. 42 Ed. 3. 19. b. a fortiori,</hi> he ſaid, he that is in by
the limitation of an uſe, being in by the act of the party
(though the Law co-operate with it, to perfect the aſſurance)
ſhall rebutt.</p>
                  <p>The Court was of Opinion that the <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> might
rebutt, that though <hi>Voucher</hi> lies in privity, an abater or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder
might rebutt. <hi>F. N. B. 135. 1 Inſt.</hi> 385. As to <hi>Serjeant
Maynard's</hi> Objection, that he is in the <hi>Poſt;</hi> they ſaid they had
adjudged lately in <hi>Fowle &amp; Doble's caſe,</hi> that a <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi>
might rebutt. So it was held in <hi>Spirt &amp; Bence's caſe, Cr. Car.
and in Jones 199. Kendal &amp; Foxe's caſe.</hi> That Report in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln
Colledge caſe,</hi> whether there were any reſolution in the
caſe or no, is founded upon ſo good reaſon, that Conveyances
ſince have gone according to it. <hi>Atkyns</hi> ſaid, there was a
difficult clauſe in the <hi>Statute of Uſes, viz. That all and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perſon and perſons, &amp;c. which at any time on this ſide the
firſt day of May, &amp;c. 1536. &amp;c. ſhall have, &amp;c.</hi> By this clauſe
they that came in by the limitation of an uſe before that day,
were to have the like advantages by <hi>Voucher</hi> or <hi>Rebutter,</hi> as
if they had béen within the degrees. If the Parliament thought
it reaſonable, why was it limited to that time? Certainly the
makers of that Law intended to deſtroy Vſes utterly, and
that there ſhould not be for the future any Conveyances to
Vſes. But they ſuppoſed that it would be ſome ſmall time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all people would take notice of the Statute, and make their
Conveyances accordingly; and that might be the reaſon of
this clauſe. But ſince, contrary to their expectations, Vſes
are continued, he could eaſily be ſatisfied; he ſaid, that <hi>Ceſtuy
que uſe</hi> ſhould rebutt. <hi>Wyndham</hi> was of Opinion, that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuy
que uſe</hi> might <hi>vouch:</hi> he ſaid there was no Authority
againſt it, but only Opinions <hi>obiter.</hi> They all agreed for the
Defendant, and Iudgment was given accordingly.</p>

more then if he had ſaid that part of the Glebe was drowned:
it is not the building of the Church, nor the conſecrated

the death of all the Monks is a diſſolution of an Abbathie.
It may be objected that the Defendant has admitted himſelf

deſign of it ſeems to be for the preſervation of mens health.
And to allow it, were to give men too great a power of ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the firſt point argued, that the Grantors are within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
the words are <hi>Deans &amp; Chapters,</hi> which he ſaid might
well be taken ſeverally; for of this <hi>Chapter</hi> there is no
Dean. If they were to be taken joyntly, then a Dean
were not within this Law, in reſpect of thoſe poſſeſſions,

general words do certainly include them; and
would extend even to Biſhops, but that they are ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

ſaid the Statute reſtrains <hi>all gifts, grants, &amp;c. other then

                     <hi>Hunt &amp; Singleton's caſe:</hi> the <hi>Chapter</hi> in our caſe never dies.
For the fourth point, he argued that it is a general Law,
becauſe it concerns all the Clergy: <hi>Holland's caſe, 4 Rep.
&amp; Dumpor's caſe: ibid. 120. b. Willmote contra. North
Chief Juſtice, Atkyns, Wyndham &amp; Ellis</hi> Iuſtices, all agreed

<hi>Atkyns</hi> doubted whether the 13 <hi>of Eliz.</hi> were a general Law
or not: but was over-ruled. They all agreed, that the
Action ſhould have been brought againſt the Patron, as well
as againſt the Ordinary and the Incumbent; but that being
only a plea in abatement, that the Defendant has waived the
benefit thereof, by pleading in Bar. And Iudgment was
given for the Plaintiff, <hi>Niſi cauſa, &amp;c. Hunt &amp; Singleton's</hi>
caſe being mentioned, <hi>Atkyns</hi> ſaid: he thought it a hard caſe;
conſidering that the <hi>Dean and the Chapter</hi> were all perſons
capable, that a grant ſhould hold in force as long as the
Dean lived, and determine then. He thought, they being a
Corporation aggregate of perſons, who were all capable, that
there was no difference betwixt that caſe and this. <hi>Ellis</hi>
ſaid, that in <hi>Floyd &amp; Gregories caſe,</hi> reported in <hi>Jones,</hi> it
was made a point: and that <hi>Jones</hi> in his argument denied
the caſe of <hi>Hunt &amp; Singleton:</hi> he ſaid, that himſelf and <hi>Sir

                  <p>AN Action in the nature of a Conſpiracy was brought
by the Plaintiff againſt the Defendant; in which the
Declaration was inſufficient. The Defendant pleaded an
ill plea: but Iudgment was given againſt the Plaintiff
upon the inſufficiency of the Declaration. Which ought
to have been entred, <hi>Quod Defendens eat inde ſine die:</hi>

The Plaintiff brings a new Action, and declares aright.
The Defendant pleads the Iudgment in the former Action,
and recites the Record <hi>verbatim</hi> as it was. To which the
Plaintiff demurred. And Iudgment was given for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,
<hi>niſi cauſa, &amp;c. North Chief Juſtice;</hi> There is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
but that if a man miſtakes his Declaration, and the
Defendant demurs; the Plaintiff may ſet it right in a ſecond
Action. But here it is objected, that the Iudgment is given
upon the Defendants plea. Suppoſe a Declaration be faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Defendant take no advantage of it, but pleads a
plea in bar: and the Plaintiff takes iſſue, and the right of
the matter is found for the Defendant; I hold that in this
caſe the Plaintiff ſhall never bring his Action about again:
for he is eſtopped by the Verdict. Or ſuppoſe ſuch a Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
demur to the plea in bar; there by his demurrer he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
the fact, if well pleaded; and this eſtops him as much
as a Verdict would. But if the plea were not good, then
there is no Eſtoppel. And we muſt take notice of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
plea; for upon the matter, as that falls out to be good,
or otherwiſe, the ſecond Action will be maintainable, or not.
The other Iudges agreed with him <hi>in omnibus.</hi>

had no other <hi>Aſſets:</hi> The Plaintiff demurred, becauſe for
ought appears the Defendant is an Executor <hi>de ſon tort:</hi>
and then he cannot retain, for his own debt. The Plaintiffs
naming him in his Declaration, <hi>Executor of the Teſtament

he cannot declare againſt him any other way, and of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

againſt the Defendant <hi>Baſeden,</hi> his Executor: he appeared to

<hi>viz.</hi> that the Defendant <hi>Baſeden</hi> was made Executor by
the Will, and dwelt in the ſame houſe, in which the Teſtator
lived and died, and that before Probate of the Will he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
himſelf of the Goods of the Teſtator, prized them, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toried
them, and ſold part of them, and paid a Debt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the value of the reſidue to his own uſe; that afterwards
before the Ordinary he refuſed, and that upon his refuſal admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
was committed to the Widow of the deceaſed. And
the queſtion was, whether or no the Defendant ſhould be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the value of the whole perſonal Eſtate, or only for as
much as he converted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Barrell</hi> argued, That he ought to be charged for
the whole, becauſe; 1. He is made Executor by the Will;
and he is thereby compleat Executor before Probate, to all
intents but: bringing of Actions. 2. He has poſſeſſion of the
Goods, and is chargeable in reſpect of that. 3. He cauſed
ſome to be ſold, and paid a Debt: which is a ſufficient admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.
There is found to diſcharge him, 1. His refuſal
before the Ordinary. But that being after he had ſo far inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddled,
avails nothing: <hi>Henſloe's caſe: 9 Co.</hi> 37. An Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
<hi>de ſon tort,</hi> he confeſſed, ſhould not be charged for more
then he converted; and ſhall diſcharge himſelf by delivering
over the reſt to the rightful Executor. But the caſe is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62849:114"/>
of a rightful Executor, that has taken upon him the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the Will. The ſecond thing found to diſcharge him,
is the granting of Adminiſtration to another: but that is
void, becauſe here is a rightful Executor that has adminiſtred:
in which caſe the Ordinary has no power to grant Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Hob. 46. Keble &amp; Osbaſton's caſe.</hi> The third thing found
to diſcharge him, is the delivery of the Goods over to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator:
but that will not avail him; for himſelf became
reſponſible by his having poſſeſſion, and he cannot diſcharge
himſelf by delivering the Goods over to a ſtranger, that has
nothing to do with them. If it be objected, that by this means
two perſons will be chargeable in reſpect of the ſame Goods;
I anſwer, that payment by either diſcharges both: <hi>Cr. Car.
Whitmore &amp; Porter's caſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Court was of Opinion, that the committing of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
in this caſe, is a mere void act. A great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
would enſue, if men were allowed to Adminiſter as far
as they would themſelves, and then to ſet up a beggarly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator:
they would pay themſelves their own Debts, and
deliver the reſidue of the Eſtate to one that's worth nothing,
and cheat the reſt of the Creditors. If an Adminiſtrator
bring an Action, it is a good plea to ſay, that the Executor
made by the Will has adminiſtred. Accordingly Iudgment

Heriot, for that the reſervation is to him and his Aſſigns, and
although the Election to have the Heriot or 40 ſhillings given
to the Leſſor, his heirs or Aſſigns, yet that will not help the
fault in the reſervation. <hi>Ellis.</hi> There is another fault, in the
pleading; for it is pleaded that <hi>Trevill</hi> made his Will in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
but it is not ſaid, that he dyed ſo ſeized; for if the Eſtate
of the Deviſor were turned to a right at the time of his death,
the Will could not operate upon it. Alſo it is ſaid, that the
Avowant made his Election, and that the Plaintiff <hi>habuit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiam</hi>
of his Election, but it is not ſaid by whom notice was
given: for theſe cauſes Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff. It
was urged likewiſe againſt the Avowant, that no Heriot could
be due in this caſe, becauſe <hi>Joan</hi> did not die firſt: but the courſe
of ſucceſſion is interrupted; and that a Heriot not being due
of common right, the words of reſervation ought to be purſued:
but as to this the Court delivered no Opinion.</p>

The Plaintiff brought an Action of Debt upon a Bond

pleaded, that the Obligor, his Anceſtor, dyed inteſtate,
and that one <hi>J. S.</hi> had taken out Letters of Adminiſtration, and
had given the Plaintiff another Bond in full ſatisfaction of the
former. Vpon this, iſſue being joyned, it was found for the
Defendant. It was ſaid for him, that one Bond might be
taken in ſatisfaction of another; and 1 <hi>Inſt. 212. b. 30 Ed. 1.
23. Dyer</hi> 29. were cited. <hi>North</hi> Chief Iuſtice: If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Bond had been given by the Obligor himſelf, it would
not have diſcharged the former: but here, being given by the
Adminiſtrator, ſo that the Plaintiffs ſecurity is bettered, and
the Adminiſtrator chargeable <hi>de bonis propriis,</hi> I conceive it
may be a ſufficient diſcharge of the firſt Bond. <hi>Wyndham
accord',</hi> elſe the Adminiſtrator and Heir might both be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<hi>Scroggs accord. Atkyns.</hi> There are many Authorities
in the point; and all directly, that one Bond cannot be given
in ſatisfaction of another. So is <hi>Cr. Eliz. 623, 697, 716.
727.</hi> and many others. But yet I hold that Iudgment
ought to be given for the Defendant; for though it be an
impertinent iſſue, yet being found for him, he ought by
the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to have Iudgment. If no iſſue
at all had been joyned, it would have been otherwiſe:

had the better title? Two points were made, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the limitation of the Remainder to the Heirs Males of
the body of the Covenantor, were good in its creation, or
not? 2. Admitting it to be good originally, whether it could
take effect after the death of <hi>Edward;</hi> he leaving Siſters,
which are general heirs to the Covenantor. <hi>North, Wynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham

for <hi>William:</hi> and that he ſhould have the Eſtate, not by
purchaſe, but by deſcent from <hi>Edward:</hi> for after the death of
the Father, both the Eſtates in tail were veſted in him: and
he was capable of the remainder by purchaſe: and being once
well veſted in a purchaſer, the Eſtate ſhall afterwards run in
courſe of deſcent: <hi>Scroggs</hi> doubted. But they all doubted of
the firſt point, and would adviſe. <hi>V. infr' Paſch. 29 Car.</hi> 2.</p>

                  <p>ACtion upon the Caſe againſt a Sheriff for an Eſcape.
The Plaintiff declares, that one <hi>G.</hi> was endebted to
him in 200 <hi>l.</hi> and that the Defendant took him upon a <hi>Latitat</hi>
at the Plaintiffs ſuit: and afterward ſuffered him to eſcape.
The Defendant pleads the <hi>Statute of 23 H. 6. cap.</hi> 10. and
that he let <hi>G.</hi> out upon Bail, according to the ſaid Statute,
and that he had taken reaſonable Sureties, <hi>A. &amp; B.</hi> perſons
having ſufficient within the County. The Plaintiff replies
and traverſes, <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> that the Defendant took Bail of
perſons having ſufficient within the Country: the Defendant
demurs. <hi>Skipwith.</hi> The Sheriff is compellable to take Bail.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62849:121"/>
If he take inſufficient Bail, the courſe is for the Court
to amerce the Sheriff, and not for the party to have an
Action upon the caſe: <hi>Cr. Eliz. 852. Bowles</hi> and <hi>Laſſell's
caſe,</hi> and <hi>Noy</hi> 39. if the Sheriff takes no Bail, an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
lies againſt him: and all Actions brought upon this
Statute are founded upon this ſuggeſtion: 3 <hi>Cro. 460.
Moor. 428. 2 Cro.</hi> 280. but if he take inſufficient bail, it is at
his own peril; and no Action lies: the Sheriff is Iudge of the
bail, and the ſum is at his diſcretion: <hi>Cr. Jac. 286. Villers &amp;
Haſtings:</hi> and ſo are the number of the perſons, he may take
one, two or three, as he pleaſeth. He cited <hi>Cr. Eliz. 808.
Clifton &amp; Web's caſe.</hi> Beſides the traverſe is pregnant, for
it implies that the perſons have ſufficient out of the County;
and the Sheriff is not bound to take bail only of perſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſufficient within the County.</p>
                  <p>Serjeant Barrell contra.</p>
                  <p>The Court not agreeing in their Opinions upon the matter
of Law, it was put off to the next Term, to be argued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baldwin</hi> for the Defendant, cited 3 <hi>Cr. 624. 152. 2 Cr. 286.
Noy 39. Rolls, tit. Eſcape, 807. Moor</hi> 428. that the Sheriff
is compellable to let him to bail, and is Iudge of the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Sureties. The Statute was made for the Priſoners
benefit, for the miſchief before was, that the Sheriff not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compellable to bail him, would extort money from him to
be bailed: and the word <hi>ſufficient</hi> is added in favour of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff;
and ſo are the words, <hi>within the County.</hi> The Sheriff
is not compellable to aſſign the bail Bond; and then, if the
Plaintiff cannot have the ſecurity given by the Defendant for
his appearance, it is all one to him, whether it be good or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strode contra.</hi> Why muſt the Sheriff always aver that he
has taken ſufficient Sureties, if their ſufficiency be not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial?
Why is an Action allowed to lie, if the Sheriff take no
Sureties at all, ſince according to my Brothers Opinion, the
party has no intereſt in them? If the Law be as they argue,
the Statute has left the Plaintiff in a worſe condition then
he was at the Common Law: for it has deprived him of the
remedy that he had before; and the Amercements belong not
to him, but to the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cur'.</hi> The ſufficiency of the bail is not material: it is only
for the Sheriffs own ſecurity. If he take no bail at all, an
Action lies againſt him, for then he does not act by colour of
this Law. <hi>Atkyns.</hi> The Statute is not advantagious to the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62849:121"/>
Plaintiff at all, unleſs the Sheriff let go the priſoner without
taking any bail; and then he muſt render treble damages.
And by the Opinion of the whole Court Iudgment was given
for the Defendant.</p>

whether the Toll which the Defendant claims, be a <hi>Toll-thorough,</hi>
or a <hi>Toll-traverſe,</hi> or what ſort of Toll it is. A
<hi>Toll-thorough</hi> is againſt common Right, becauſe it is to
be taken in the Kings High-way. And no Preſcription can
be for it, unleſs he that claims it, ſhew that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
has ſome advantage by it. And when a man claims a

the Defendant has diſcloſed in his Plea, and have made a
ſpecial concluſion upon a Point of pleading. Toll may be
appurtenant to a Mannor, as well as any other <hi>profit a pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre.</hi>
Nor does it become in groſs by the Mannor coming
to the Crown. The difference is, as to that, betwixt things,
that had a being in the Crown, before they were granted
out to Subjects, and things which had not, 9. <hi>Rep. The Caſe

difference between a <hi>Toll-thorough</hi> and a <hi>Toll-traverſe,</hi> as
has been offered: the words are uſed promiſcuouſly in our

any reaſonable cauſe alledged of its commencement: for
having been paid time out of mind, the true cauſe of its
beginning, in the intendment of the Law cannot be known.
And for the <hi>que eſtate;</hi> indeed a thing that lies in grant,

2.</hi> appears in Sir <hi>Robert Cotton's Abr. of the Records of
the Tower, fol. 173. num.</hi> 9. 10. he ſays there, That upon
the opening of that Parliament, the Biſhop of <hi>St. Davids</hi> in
a Speech to both Houſes declared the Cauſes of its being
ſummoned, and that amongſt the reſt one of them was to
have ſome reſtraint laid upon Slanderers and Sowers of
Diſcord: which ſort of men were then taken notice of to be
very frequent. <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae Leges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Preamble of the Act mentions <hi>falſe News</hi> and <hi>horrible
Lyes, &amp;c. of things, which by the ſaid Prelates, &amp;c. were
never ſaid, done nor thought.</hi> So that it ſeems deſigned
againſt telling ſtories by way of News concerning them.
The Stat. does not make or declare any new Offence. Nor
does it inflict any new Puniſhment. All that ſeems to be
new is this, 1. The Offence receives an aggravation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is now an Offence againſt a poſitive Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
deſerves a greater Puniſhment; as it is held in
our Books, That if the King prohibit by his Proclamation,
a thing prohibited by Law, that the Offence receives an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
by being againſt the King's Proclamation.
2. Though there be no expreſs Action given to the party
grieved, yet by operation of Law the Action accrews. For
when ever a Statute prohibits any thing, he that finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
grieved, may have an Action upon the Statute 10 <hi>Rep. 75.
12 Rep.</hi> 100. there this very Caſe upon this Statute was
agreed on by the Iudges. So that that is the ſecond new thing,
<hi>viz.</hi> a further remedy, <hi>An Action upon the Stat.</hi> 3. Since
the Stat. the party may have an Action in the <hi>tam, quam.</hi>
Which he could not have before. Now every lye or falſity is
not within the Stat. It muſt be <hi>horrible,</hi> as well as falſe.
We find upon another occaſion ſuch a like diſtinction; It
was held in the 12 <hi>Rep.</hi> 83. That the High-Commiſſion
Court could not puniſh Adultery; becauſe they had Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to puniſh enormous Offendors only. So that <hi>great</hi> and
<hi>horrible</hi> are words of diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Again, it extends not to ſmall matters, becauſe of the ill
conſequences mentioned; <hi>Debates and Diſcord betwixt the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62849:124"/>
ſaid Lords, &amp;c. great peril to the Realm, and quick ſubverſion
and deſtruction of the ſame.</hi> Every word imports an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
The Stat. does not extend to words that do not
agree with this Deſcription, and that cannot by any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
probability have ſuch dire effects. The Caſes upon this
Statute are but few and late, in reſpect of the antiquity of
the Act. It was made <hi>Anno</hi> 1379. for a long time after we
hear no tydings of an Action grounded upon it. And by
reading it one would imagine, that the makers of it never
intended that any ſhould be. But the Action ariſes by ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Law; not from the words of the Act, nor their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
that made it. The <hi>firſt</hi> Caſe that we find of an Action
brought upon it, is in 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which is 120 years after the
Law was made: ſo that we have no <hi>contemporanea expoſitio,</hi>
which we often affect. That Caſe is in <hi>Keil.</hi> 26. the next in
4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. where the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> recovered 40 <hi>l.</hi> againſt
one <hi>Lucas,</hi> for ſaying that <hi>the Duke had no more conſcience
than a Dog; and ſo he got money, he cared not how he came
by it.</hi> He cited other Caſes, and ſaid he obſerved, That
where the words were general, the Iudges did not ordinarily
admit them to be actionable; otherwiſe, when they charged
a Peer with any particular miſcarriage. <hi>Serjeant Maynard</hi>
obſerved well, That the Nobility and great men are equally
coucerned on the Defendants part: for Actions upon this
Statute lie againſt them, as well as againſt the meaneſt
Subject. Acts of Parliament have been tender of racking
the King's Subjects for words. And the Scripture diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances
mens being made <hi>Tranſgreſſors for a word.</hi> I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that there is not one caſe to be met with, in which upon
a motion in arreſt of Iudgment, in ſuch an Action as this,
the Defendant has prevailed. The Court hath ſometimes
been divided: the matter compounded: the Action has
abated by death, &amp;c. but a poſitive Rule that Iudgment
ſhould be arreſted we find not. So that it is time to make
a Preſident, and fix ſome Rules according to which men may
demean themſelves in converſe with great perſons. <hi>Miſera
eſt ſervitus, ubi jus eſt vagum.</hi> Since we have obtained no
Rules from our Predeceſſors in Actions upon this Statute,
we had beſt go by the ſame Rules that they did in other
Actions for words. In them, when they grew frequent, ſome
bonnds and limits were ſet, by which they endeavoured to
make theſe Law certain. The Actions now encreaſe. The
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:62849:124"/>
ſtream ſeems to be running that way. I think it is our part
to obviate the miſchief. So he was of Opinion, That the

                     <hi>NOrth.</hi> In Actions of Debt, &amp;c. the firſt Proceſs is
<hi>a Summons,</hi> if the Defendant appears not upon
that, a <hi>Cap.</hi> goes, and then we hold him to Bail.
The reaſon of Bail is upon a ſuppoſition of Law,
that the Defendant flies the Iudgment of the Law. And
this ſuppoſition is grounded upon his not appearing at the
firſt. For if he appear upon the <hi>Summons,</hi> no Bail is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
And this is the reaſon, why it is held againſt the
Law for any inferiour Court, to iſſue out a <hi>Capias</hi> for the firſt
Proceſs. For the liberty of a man is highly valued in the Law,
and no man ought to be abridged of it, without ſome default
in him.</p>
                  <p>A Church is in decay, the Biſhops Court muſt proceed
againſt the whole Pariſh, to have it repair'd: they cannot
Rate any particular perſon towards the repair of it. But
the Church-wardens muſt ſummon the Pariſh; and that
needs not be from houſe to houſe, but a general publick
Summons at the Church is ſufficient: and the major part
of them that appear, may bind the Pariſh. If the Church
and Chancel be out of repair, the Pariſhioners are only
chargeable to be contributory towards the Repairs of the
<hi>Navis Eccleſiae.</hi> If a Libel be againſt the Pariſh, for not
repairing the Church, though the word <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> may include
the Chancel, yet we will not grant a Prohibition. If a
Tax be ſet by the major part of the Pariſh, <hi>pro reparatione
Eccleſiae,</hi> it is well enough: and afterward any part of the
money raiſed be laid out upon the Chancel, the Pariſh ought
not to allow it upon the Church-wardens accounts. But if
a Tax be impoſed expreſly for the repair of the body of the
Church, and of the Chancel, we will not ſuffer them to
proceed. Or if a Libel be againſt a Pariſh for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
the <hi>Navis Eccleſiae and the Chancel,</hi> we will prohibit
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:62849:125"/>
them. If a Church be down, and the Pariſh encreaſed, ſo
that of neceſſity they muſt have a larger Church, the major
part of the Pariſh may raiſe a Tax for the enlarging it, as
well as the repairing it, <hi>per Cur.</hi> It was inſiſted on at the
Bar, that to a Tax for the encreaſing of a Church, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of every Pariſhioner muſt be had. But the Court was
of another Opinion.</p>

ſeems intended to extirpate all private Vſes, and was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Common Law. He cited <hi>the Earl of Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's
Caſe, 1 Rep. 130. a. Poph. 3 &amp; 4. &amp; Moor. 718. and
Fenwyke and Miltford's Caſe, 1 Inſt. 22. b.</hi> If <hi>Thomas</hi> took
any eſtate by this ſettlement, he took a Fée-ſimple. For no
eſtate being limited to him, if he took any, the Law veſted
it in him. Now the act of Law will not ſettle in him an
Eſtate tail, which is a fettered Eſtate, but a Fée-ſimple, if
any thing. And the rather, becauſe the reaſon of it muſt be
upon a ſuppoſition, that the old Vſe continues ſtill in him,
being never well limited out of him. Then he argued, that
admitting the limitation to be good, yet ſince it veſted in
<hi>Edward</hi> as a Purchaſor, it is ſpent by his dying without
iſſue.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>North, Windham</hi> and <hi>Atkins</hi> were of Opinion, That
if an Eſtate limited to a man and the Heirs of the body of
his Father, veſt in him, be it either by deſcent or purchaſe,
that if he die without iſſue, it ſhall go to his Brother, &amp;c. ſo
that in this caſe, if the remainder to the Heirs males of
<hi>Thomas,</hi> ever veſted in <hi>Edward,</hi> it comes to <hi>William,</hi> as Heir
male of the body of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and he is a ſpecial Heir to take
by deſcent.</p>
                  <p>2. They agreed that at the Common Law a man could
not make his right Heir a Purchaſor, without parting with
the whole feé; but that by way of Vſe he might: <hi>Creſwold's
Caſe in Dyer</hi> is of an Eſtate executed. They agreed the
limitation of the remainder in this caſe to be good, and that
it veſted in <hi>Edward,</hi> as a Purchaſor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>North.</hi> It cannot take effect as a ſpringing Vſe; becauſe
where the limitation is of a remainder, the Law will never
conſtrue it ſo, as to ſupport it any other way. This (he ſaid)
he had known reſolved in one <hi>Cutler's</hi> Caſe in the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi>

                     <hi>Serjeant Strode pro Defendente.</hi> Before the <hi>Statute of
Weſtm. 2. cap.</hi> 10. no man could make an Attorney without
the Kings Writ <hi>de Attornato faciendo:</hi> and there was no
other return at the Common Law then <hi>cepi corpus,</hi> or <hi>non eſt
inventus. Vide 32 H.</hi> 6. 28. The Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. doth not
alter the Return. The deſign of that Statute is only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the Defendants eaſe, and againſt the extortion of
Sheriffs and their Officers: ſo that the Sheriff being obliged
to return a <hi>Cepi,</hi> and yet to let the Defendant to bail, there
can be do reaſon why he ſhould be charged for not having the
body at the day. He cited <hi>Langton &amp; Gardners caſe Cr. Eliz.
460. Barton &amp; Aldworth: Cr. Eliz. 624. in Bowles &amp; Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel's
caſe, ibid.</hi> 852. The Sheriff took bail according to this
Statute, and returned a <hi>languidus in priſona,</hi> though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
was at large: reſolved that no Action lay againſt the
Sheriff. <hi>Trin. 13 Jac. Rolls Abr. 1. part</hi> 92. no Action lies
againſt the Sheriff for not having the body at the day, becauſe
he is compellable by the <hi>Statute</hi> to let him to bail: and ſo he
ſaid it was reſolved in a caſe between <hi>Francklyn &amp; Andrews
Br. 24 Car.</hi> 1. but adjudged for the Plaintiff upon the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of the pleading.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Conyers</hi> for the Plaintiff. I agrée that an Action
of Eſcape will not lie againſt the Sheriff, becauſe he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellable
to let him to bail: but this is an Action at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law for a falſe Return; which if it ſhould not be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable,
the deſign of the Statute would be defrauded: for
the Plaintiff cannot controll the Sheriff in his taking bail, but
he may take what perſons and what bail he pleaſeth: and if he
ſhould not be chargeable in an Action for not having the body
ready, the Plaintiff could never have the effect of his Suit:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62849:129"/>
and although the Sheriff be chargeable, he will be at no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice;
for he may repair his loſs by the bail-bond: and it is
his own fault if he takes not ſecurity ſufficient to anſwer the
Debt. The laſt clauſe in the Statute is, <hi>That if any Sheriff
return a Cepi corpus or reddidit ſe, he ſhall be chargeable to
have the body at the day of the Return, as he was before, &amp;c.</hi>
that <hi>(if)</hi> implies a Liberty in the Sheriff not to return a
<hi>Cepi corpus</hi> or <hi>reddidit ſe.</hi> But notwithſtanding, by the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>North Chief Juſtice, Wyndham &amp; Atkyns Juſtice,</hi> the
Plaintiff was barred. <hi>Bowles &amp; Laſſel's caſe,</hi> they ſaid, was
a ſtrong caſe to govern the point; and the return of <hi>paratum
habeo</hi> is in effect no more then if he had the body ready to
bring into Court, when the Court ſhould command him;
and it is the common practice only to amerce the Sheriff
till he does bring in the body: and therefore no Action lies
againſt him; for it is not reaſonable that he ſhould be twice
puniſhed for one Offence, and that againſt the Court only.

would be pleadable. I have known it reſolved, that the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Limitations</hi> is not a good plea againſt an Attorny,
that brings an Action for his Fees, becauſe they depend upon a
Record here, and are certain.</p>
                  <p>Next <hi>Trinity Term,</hi> the matter being moved again, the
Court gave Iudgment for the Plaintiff, <hi>Niſi cauſa, &amp;c.</hi> if the
<hi>Fieri facias</hi> had been returned, then the Action would have beén
grounded upon the Record, and it is the Sheriffs fault that the
Writ is not returned: but however the Iudgment in this
Court is the foundation of the Action. Debt upon the <hi>Stat.
of 2 Edw.</hi> 6. for not ſetting out Tythes, is not within the
<hi>Stat.</hi> for <hi>oritur ex maleficio:</hi> ſo the ground of this Action is

                     <hi>PArrot</hi> had married one <hi>Judith Barrow</hi> an Heireſs. <hi>Sir
Herbert Parrot,</hi> his Father, and an ignorant Carpenter,
by vertue of a <hi>dedimus poteſtatem</hi> to them directed, took the
conuſance of a Fine of the ſaid <hi>Judith,</hi> being under age, and
by Indenture the uſe was limited to <hi>Mr. Parrot</hi> and his wife
for their two lives, the remainder to the Heirs of the Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor;
about two years after the wife died without iſſue; and
<hi>Barrow</hi> as heir to her prayed the relief of the Court. Vpon
examination it appear'd, that <hi>Sir Herbert</hi> did examine the
woman whether ſhe were willing to levy the fine? and asked
the husband and her, whether ſhe were of age or not? both
anſwered that ſhe was. She afterwards, being privately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
touching her conſent, anſwered as before, and that ſhe
had no conſtraint upon her by her husband, but ſhe was not
there queſtion'd concerning her age. <hi>Sir Herbert Parrot</hi> was
not examined in Court upon Oath, becauſe he was accuſed;

Proceſs continued to the <hi>great diſtreſs:</hi> which being return'd,
and no appearance, Iudgment final was ordered to be entred
according to the <hi>Statute of Marlebr. cap.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>It was moved to have this rule diſcharged, becauſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was not ſummoned, neither upon the Attachment nor the
<hi>great diſtreſs,</hi> and the Sureties returned upon the Proceſs
were <hi>John Doo &amp; Richard Roo:</hi> an <hi>Affidavit</hi> was produced
of <hi>Non-ſummons,</hi> and that the Defendant had not put in any
Sureties, nor knew any ſuch perſon as <hi>John Doo &amp; Richard
Roo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was objected on the other ſide, that they had notice of
the ſuit; for they appeared to the Summons; and it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they were guilty of a voluntary delay, in that they
<hi>forched in eſſoyne:</hi> and the <hi>Stat. of Marlebr.</hi> is peremptory;
wherefore they prayed Iudgment.</p>

                     <hi>Serjeant Maynard for the Defendants.</hi> If Iudgment be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt us, we have no remedy, but by a Writ of <hi>Deceit.</hi>
Now in a Writ of <hi>Deceit</hi> the <hi>Sumners</hi> and <hi>veyors</hi> are to be
examin'd in Court: and this is the Trial in that Action: but
feigned perſons cannot be examined. It is a great abuſe in
the Officers to return ſuch feigned names. The firſt cauſe
thereof was the ignorance of Sheriffs, who being to make a
return, looked into ſome Book of Preſidents for a form; and
finding the names of <hi>John Doo</hi> and <hi>Rich. Roo</hi> put down for
examples, made their return accordingly, and took no care
for true <hi>Sumners</hi> and true <hi>Manucaptors.</hi> For <hi>Non-appearance</hi>

final Iudgment is to be given, and our right bound for ever,
which ought not to be ſuffered, unleſs after Proceſs legally
ſerved, according to the intention of the Statute. In a caſe
<hi>Mich.</hi> 23. of the preſent King, Iudgment was entred in
this Court in a plea of <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> upon <hi>non-appearance</hi>
to the <hi>great Diſtreſs;</hi> but there the party was ſummoned, and
true Summoners returned; upon <hi>non-appearance</hi> an Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
iſſued, and real <hi>Sumners</hi> return'd upon that: but upon
the <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> it was return'd, that the Defendants <hi>diſtricti fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt
per bona &amp; catalla, &amp; manucapti per Joh. Doo &amp; Rich.
Roo:</hi> and for that cauſe the Iudgment was <hi>vacated. Cur'.</hi>
The deſign of the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge</hi> was to have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
duly executed, which if it were executed as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
the Tenant could not poſſibly but have notice of it.
For, if he do not appear upon the Summons, an Attachment
goes out; that is a command to the Sheriff to ſeize his body,
and make him give Sureties for his appearance: if yet he will
not appear, then the great diſtreſs is awarded; that is, the
Sheriff is commanded to ſeize the thing in queſtion; if he
come not in for all this, then Iudgment final is to be given.
Now the iſſue of this Proceſs being ſo fatal, that the right of
the party is concluded by it, we ought not to ſuffer this
Proceſs to be changed into a thing of courſe. It is true, the
Defendant here had notice of the Suit; but he had not ſuch
notice as the Law does allow him, And for his <hi>fourching in
eſſoyn,</hi> the Law allows it him. Accordingly the Iudgment was

to civil purpoſes the Kingdom is divided into <hi>Villes.</hi> He
do not intend it of a Pariſh, becauſe the diviſion of the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62849:133"/>
Kingdom into Pariſhes is an Eccleſiaſtical diſtribution to
Spiritual purpoſes. But the Law in many caſes takes
notice of Pariſhes in civil affairs, and Cuſtom having by
degrees introduced it, we may allow of it in a Recovery as well
as in a Fine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scroggs accordant.</hi> If an Infant levy a Fine, when he
becomes of full age, he ſhall be bound by the Deed that
leads the Vſes of the Fine, as well as by the Fine it ſelf,
becauſe the Law looks upon both as one aſſurance. So the
Court was of Opinion that the Lands did paſs.</p>
                  <p>It was then ſuggeſted, that Iudgment ought not to
be given notwithſtanding; for that the Plaintiff was dead.
But they ſaid they would not ſtay Iudgment for that,
as this caſe was. For between the Leſſor of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
and the Defendant there was another cauſe depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and tryed at the ſame Aſſizes, when this iſſue was
tryed, and by agreément between the parties the Verdict
in that cauſe was not drawn up, but agreed that it
ſhould enſue the determination of this Verdict, and the
title to go accordingly. Now the ſubmiſſion to this
Rule was an implicite agreement not to take advantage
of ſuch occurrences as the death of the Plaintiff in an
<hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> whom we know to be no wiſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in point of intereſt, and many times but an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
perſon. It was ſaid alſo to have Iudgment, that
there lived in the County where the Lands in queſtion
are, a man of the ſame name with him that was made
Plaintiff. This the Court ſaid was ſufficient, and that
were there any of that name <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that he was the Plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cur<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> We take notice judicially, that the Leſſor of the
Plaintiff is the perſon intereſted, and therefore we puniſh
the Plaintiff, if he releaſe the Action, or releaſe the damages.
Accordingly Iudgment was given.</p>

the Letters Patents of the <hi>Second of the Queen, viz.</hi> by

                  <p>
                     <hi>North.</hi> What is it that you call the final Iudgment?
there are two Iudgments in a <hi>Quare Impedit:</hi> one that the
Plaintiff ſhall have a writ to the Biſhop, and that is the final
Iudgment, that goes to the right betwixt the parties. And
the Iudgment at the Common Law. There in another

Iudgment to be given for Damages ſince the <hi>Stat. of Weſt. 2.

party.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pemberton.</hi> This <hi>Wingate</hi> that recovered, was a ſtranger,
and had no title to have a <hi>Quare Impedit.</hi> Now I take this
difference; where the King has a good Title, no recovery
againſt his Clerk, ſhall affect the King's Title; he ſhall not
be prejudiced by a Recovery, to which he is no party. If
the King have a defeaſible Title, as in our caſe by Vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there if the rightful Patron recover againſt the King's
Incumbent, the King's Title ſhall be bound, though he be
not a party: for his Title having no other Foundation than
a Preſentation, when that is once avoided, the Kings Title
falls together with it. But though the Kings Title be only
by Vſurpation, yet a Recovery againſt his Clerk by a
ſtranger, that has nothing to do with it, ſhall not predu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
the King: covin may be betwixt them, and the King be
tried. Now <hi>Wingate</hi> had no Right: for he claimed by
Grant from one <hi>Adie,</hi> to whom <hi>Ludwell</hi> granted <hi>ann. 33 Eliz.</hi>
But we can prove this Grant by <hi>Ludwell</hi> to have been void,
for in the <hi>29th of the Queen</hi> he had made a Prior Grant to
one <hi>Danſon;</hi> of which Grant we here produce the Inrolment.
This Grant to <hi>Danſon</hi> was an effectual Grant, for <hi>anno
11 Jacobi</hi> a Preſentation was made by <hi>J. R. &amp; Th. Danſon,</hi>
which proves that this Grant took effect, and the Defendant
himſelf deduceth the Title of his own Patron under that
Grant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Barrel. Wingate</hi> is not to be accounted a ſtranger; for he
makes Title by the Letters Letters Patents of 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> ſo
that he encounters the Queen with her own Grant: and
his Title under that Grant was allowed by the Court, who
gave Iudgment accordingly. There was no <hi>faint Pleader</hi>
in the Caſe, as appears by the Record, that has been read.
And covin ſhall not be preſumed, if it be not alledged. We
deduce our Title under the Grant made to <hi>Danſon, 29 Eliz.</hi>
in our plea, but that is only by way of inducement to our
traverſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cur.</hi> By that Iudgment <hi>temp. Regin. Eliz.</hi> the Quéens Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

a Title. <hi>Ex diuturnitate temporis omnia preſumuntur ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniter

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62849:135"/>
the matter was freſh. Without doubt <hi>Danſon</hi> would have
aſſerted his Title againſt <hi>Wingate,</hi> if he had had any. The
Defendant did not do prudently in conveying a Title to
his Patron under the Grant made to <hi>Danſon:</hi> but iſſue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken upon the Quéens dying ſeized, he ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to give in Evidence any other Title to maintain the
Iſſue. Vpon which Evidence the Iury found for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,

                  <p>
                     <hi>North</hi> ſaid, He was clearly of Opinion, That the Kings

                     <hi>Pemberton.</hi> The King may by Law grant the ſole-printing
of <hi>Almanacks.</hi> The Art of Printing is altogether of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſideration in the eye of the Law, than other Trades
and Myſteries are; the Preſs is a late Invention. But the
Exorbitancies and Licentiouſneſs thereof has ever ſince it
was firſt found out been under the care and reſtraint of the
Magiſtrate. For great Miſchiefs and Diſorder would enſue
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:62849:135"/>
to the Common-wealth, if it were under no Regulation:
and it has therefore always been thought fit to be under the
Inſpection and Controul of the Government. And the <hi>Stat.
14. Car.</hi> 2. recites that it is a matter of publique Care. In
<hi>England</hi> it has from time to time been under the Kings own
Regulation, ſo that no Book could lawfully be printed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> granted by ſome that derive authority
from him to Licence Books. But the queſtion here is not,
Whether the King may by Law grant the ſole-Printing of
all Books; but of any, and of what ſort of Books? the
ſole-printing of Law-Books is not now in queſtion; that
ſeémed to be a point of ſome difficulty, becauſe of the large
extent of ſuch a Patent, and the uncertainty of determining
what ſhould be accounted a Law-Book, and what not. And
yet ſuch a Patent has been allowed to be good by a Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Houſe of Péers. When Sir <hi>Orlando Bridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> in this Court, there was a queſtion
raiſed concerning the validity of a Grant of the ſole-printing
of any particular Book, with a Prohibition to all others to
print the ſame, how far it ſhould ſtand good againſt them
that claim a Property in the Copy paramount to the Kings
Grant? and Opinions were divided upon the Point. But
the Defendant in our Caſe makes no Title to the Copy;
only he pretends a nullity in our Patent. The Book which
this Defendant has printed, has no certain Author: and
then, according to the Rule of our Law, the King has the
property; and by conſequence may grant his Property to the
Company.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cur.</hi> There is no difference in any material part betwixt
this <hi>Almanack</hi> and that that is put in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the
<hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> Now the <hi>Almanack</hi> that is before the
<hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> proceeds from a publick Conſtitution; it
was firſt ſetled by the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> is eſtabliſhed by the
Canons of the Church, and is under the Government of
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> So that <hi>Almanacks</hi> may be
accounted Prerogative Copies. Thoſe particular <hi>Almanacks,</hi>
that are made yearly, are but applications of the general
Rules there laid down for the moveable Feaſts for ever, to
every particular year. And without doubt, this may be
granted by the King. This is a ſtronger Caſe than that of
Law-Books, which has been mentioned. The Lords in
in the Reſolution of that Caſe relyed upon this, That
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:62849:136"/>
Printing was a new Invention, and therefore every man
could not by the Common Law have a liberty of printing
Law-Books. And ſince Printing has been invented, and is
become a common Trade, ſo much of it as has been kept
incloſed, never was made common: but matters of State,
and things that concern the Government, were never left
to any mans liberty to print that would. And particularly
the ſole. Printing of Law-Books has been formerly granted
in other Reigns. Though Printing be a new Invention,
yet the uſe and benefit of it is only for men to publiſh their
Works with more eaſe than they could before: Men had
ſome other way to publiſh their Thoughts before Printing
came in; and foraſmuch as Printing has always been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Care of the Government ſince it was firſt ſet on
foot, we may well preſume that the former way was ſo too.
<hi>Queen Elizabeth, King James, and King Charles the Firſt,</hi>
granted ſuch Patents as theſe; and the Law has a great
reſpect to common uſage. We ought to be guided in our
Opinions by the Iudgment of the Houſe Peérs; which is
expreſs in the point: the ultimate reſort of Law and Iuſtice
being to them. There is no particular Author of an <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack:</hi>
and then by the Rule of our Law, the King has the
Property in the Copy. Thoſe additions of Prognoſtications
and other things that are common in <hi>Almanacks,</hi> do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Caſe; no more than if a man ſhould claim a property
in another mans Copy, by reaſon of ſome inconſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of his own. Accordingly Iudgment was given for the

the Plaintiff to repair the ſame, had granted a <hi>Sequeſtration</hi>

32 H. 8. c.</hi> 7. has converted the Tythes of ſuch Rectories
into a Lay-Feé, it has conſequently exempted them from the

<hi>the Stat. of 31 H.</hi> 8. whereby <hi>Penſions, Proxies</hi> and <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
are ſaved, what remedy lay for the recovery of them;
and it was therefore provided by the <hi>Stat. 32 H.</hi> 8. that the

Perſons were ſubjected to the Iuriſdiction of the Ordinary,
and might be ſequeſtred in many caſes by Proceſs out of the
Biſhops Courts: but when-ever the Poſſeſſions of Lay-men
were charged with any Eccleſiaſtical payment or Spiritual
charge, the Ordinary could not take the Land into his hands,
nor meddle with the Poſſeſſion thereof in any ſort; but the
conſtant uſage was to compel the perſons by Eccleſiaſtical
Cenſures. <hi>Anno</hi> 1570. there was application made to the
Queén to provide a remedy for the Reparation of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels

Moreover, he ſaid, A Sequeſtration does not bind
the Intereſt, nor put the Rector out of poſſeſſion, the not
ſubmitting to it is only matter of contempt; and it can no

indeed, That Fines and Recoveries may be ſuffered of

though they have not <hi>Jus ſepulturae</hi> there. The practice is

                  <p>
                     <hi>North.</hi> The Biſhop is in the nature of an Eccleſiaſtical
Sheriff. If an Action of Debt were brought againſt a Clerk,
and the Sheriff had returned upon a <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> that the
Defendant was <hi>Clericus beneficiatus non habens Laicum feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum;</hi>
there iſſued a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> to the Biſhop, upon which
he uſed to <hi>ſequeſter</hi> (as they call it) the Eccleſiaſtical poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the Defendant, but that is not properly a <hi>Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
for the Ordinary muſt not return <hi>Sequeſtrari feci:</hi> he
muſt return <hi>Fieri feci</hi> or <hi>nulla bona,</hi> in like manner as a
Sheriff of a County muſt do: this I have known in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that a Biſhop has been ordered in ſuch a caſe to amend
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62849:137"/>
his return. The reaſon of this Proceſs was, becauſe the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
of Eccleſiaſtical perſons were ſo diſtinct from Temporal
poſſeſſions, that they could not be ſubject to the ordinary proceſs
of the Temporal Law, no more than poſſeſſions of lay-men could
be ſubject to their Iurisdiction. And therefore Rectories im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
being now incorporated into the Common Law, and
converted into lay-fees, It ſhould ſeem to me, that they are
thereby exempted from the Iurisdiction of the Ordinary. And
this I take to be within the reaſon of <hi>Jeffrie's Caſe in the 5th
Rep.</hi> where temporal perſons, that are liable to contribute
towards the repairs of the Church, out of their temporal poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
are ſaid to be compellable thereunto by Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Cenſures. It has béen ſaid, that the Pariſhioners have a
right in the Chancel: but I queſtion that: it is called <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellum,
a cancellis:</hi> becauſe the Pariſhioners are barred from
thence. It is the right of the Parſon. <hi>Windham</hi> thought,
that by the ſaving in the <hi>Stat. of 31 H.</hi> 8. the Iurisdiction of the
Ordinary was preſerved. <hi>Atkyns.</hi> The Parſon was charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the reparation of the Chancel, in reſpect of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which he received. They were the proper Debtors. Now
I think it may be held that the Impropriation affects only the
Surpluſage of the profits over and above all Charges and
Duties iſſuing out of the Parſonage, and wherewith it was
originally charged. The reparation of the Chancel is a right
ariſing from the firſt donation: which ſhall not be taken away
but by expreſs words. <hi>Scroggs accordant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>North.</hi> The Defendants plea is naught; for the cauſe of
their juſtification is, that what they did was in executing a
Sequeſtration, whereby they were authorized to take into their
hands the profits of the Rectory, for the reparation of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.
Now they ought to avert, that they did not take into their
hands more than was ſufficient for the reparation thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>North.</hi> If the Law come to be taken as my Brothers are of
Opinion, it will make a great ſtep to the giving Ordinaries
power to encreaſe Vicarages. For the Pariſhioners have a
right to a Maintenance for one to preach to them. <hi>Adjor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Waller</hi> argued, that there was no good Tenant to
the <hi>Praecipe:</hi> for that <hi>Tho. Peeps</hi> never was in poſſeſſion by
vertue of the Leaſe for ſix months. No Entry is found, nor
no conſideration to raiſe an uſe. All the conſideration menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
is the reſervation of a Pepper-corn; which is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:
for it is to be paid out of the profits of the Land. He
compared it to <hi>Colyer's caſe 6 Rep.</hi> where a ſum in groſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be paid by the Deviſee, gave him an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple:
but a ſum to be paid out of the profits of the Land,
not. He cited the <hi>Lord Pagett's caſe, Moor. 343. Dyer 10.
placito</hi> 31. Beſides, the conſideration in our caſe is a thing
of no value: being but a ſingle Pepper-corn. If an Infant
make a Leaſe for years, rendring Rent, the Leaſe is but void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
but if an Infant make a Leaſe for years, rendring a
Roſe, or a Pepper-corn, or any ſuch like trifle, the Leaſe is
void. He cited <hi>Fitzherb. tit. Entry congeable</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>North.</hi> When a Tenant for life or years aſſigns his Eſtate,
there needs no conſideration, in ſuch caſe the tenure and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
and the being ſubject to the ancient forfeiture, and
the payment of Rent, if there were any, is ſufficient to veſt the
uſe in the Aſſignee: but otherwiſe in caſe of a Fee-ſimple.
When a man is ſeiſed in Fee, and makes a Leaſe for years,
unleſs he give poſſeſſion, and that the Leſſee enter, he muſt
raiſe an Vſe. But in our caſe the reſervation ſeems not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to raiſe an Vſe, for an Vſe muſt be raiſed, and the Land
united to it, before a Rent can reſult out of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wyndham.</hi> It being in the caſe of a common Recovery,
we muſt ſupport it, if it be poſſible. In <hi>Sutton's Hoſpital's
caſe, 10 Rep. 34. a.</hi> it is ſaid that the reſervation of 12 <hi>d.</hi>
Rent was a ſufficient conſideration to veſt an Vſe in the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital:
and a Rent of 12 <hi>d.</hi> is as inconſiderable a matter in
conſideration of a great Eſtate, as a Pepper-corn in our caſe.
The caſe in <hi>Dyer,</hi> that has been cited, is made a <hi>Quaere</hi> in
the book. I think the reſervation of a Rent would have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
an Vſe at the Common Law, and will raiſe an Vſe at this
day; If a Feoffee to an Vſe had made a Feoffment in Fee
rendring Rent, the feoffment (I conceive) would have been
to the uſe of the ſecond feoffée, and the firſt Vſe deſtroyed.
The other two Iuſtices delivered no Opinion.</p>

At another day, the cauſe being moved again, <hi>North</hi> ſaid,
he had looked upon the Preſident quoted out of <hi>Sutton's Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals
caſe;</hi> and that there the reſervation of a Rent was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Deed as a conſideration to raiſe an Vſe, which,

the Condition was,</hi> That if the above-bounden

unto Hopton Baſſett, as the Council of the ſaid Hopton Baſſett,

pounds per annum, payable half-yearly by equal portions, from
the death of the ſaid Mary, during Hopton Baſſett's life, if

of an Annuity, within the time of ſix months after the death

                  <p>
                     <hi>Strode</hi> for the Defendant. The Plaintiff ought to have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
us a grant of Annuity, to be ſealed within ſix months,
&amp;c. and having neglected that, he has diſpenſed with the whole
Condition. For 1. This is not a diſ-junctive Condition, but

of the word <hi>not,</hi> put the words <hi>refuſe to, &amp;c.</hi> and the

is but 20 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for a life, and 300 <hi>l.</hi> in money is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:62849:139"/>
more then the value of it, ſo that it cannot be intended a ſum
to be paid in lieu or recompence of it; but muſt be taken for
a penalty.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe it to be a diſ-junctive Condition, then we ought
to have an Election whether we would do; but as this caſe is,
the Plaintiff by his negligence has deprived us of our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For Authorities he cited <hi>Gerningham &amp; Ewer's caſe, Cr.

&amp; Warner &amp; Whyte's caſe,</hi> reſolved the day before in the Kings

Moors Reports,</hi> 645. which makes againſt me: but the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of that caſe is Law; and there needed no ſuch rule.
That caſe goes upon the reaſon of <hi>Lambs caſe, 5 Rep.</hi> when
a man is obliged to pay ſuch a ſum as <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall aſſeſs, <hi>J. S.</hi>
being a meer ſtranger, the Obligor takes upon him, that <hi>J. S.</hi>
ſhall aſſeſs a ſum in certain; and he muſt procure him to do
it, or he forfeits his Obligation. But in our caſe nothing is
to be done but by the Obligee himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pemberton contra.</hi> He argued that the Obligors Election is
not taken away; for though no Deed were tendred him, he
might have got one made, and the tender of that would have
diſcharged the Condition of his Bond. Indeed this will put
him to charge, but he may have an Action of Debt for what he
lays out. He cited the caſes cited by <hi>Walmeſley in Moor</hi> 645. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

                  <p>
                     <hi>North.</hi> The caſe of <hi>Warner &amp; White,</hi> adjudged yeſterday
in the Court of Kings Bench, is according to Law; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
there was, that <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhould pay ſuch a ſum upon the
<hi>25th of December,</hi> or ſhould appear in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term after, in
the Court of Kings Bench. <hi>J. S.</hi> died after the <hi>25th day of Dec',</hi>
and before <hi>Hill. Term;</hi> and had paid nothing upon the <hi>25th of
December.</hi> In that caſe the Condition was not broken by
the non-payment, and the other part is become impoſſible by
the act of God. But I think, that if the firſt part of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be rendred impoſſible by the act of God, that the Obligor
is bound to perform the other part: But in the caſe at the bar
the Obligors Election is taken away by the act of the Obligee
himſelf. And I ſee no difference betwixt this caſe and that of
<hi>Gerningham &amp; Ewer, in Cr. Eliz.</hi> if the Condition of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
be ſingle, to make ſuch aſſurance as ſhall be adviſed
by the Council of the Obligee; there <hi>concilium non dedit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſamentum,</hi>
is a good plea; and the Obligor is not bound to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62849:140"/>
make an aſſurance of his own head; no more ſhall he be bound
to do it when the Condition is in the diſ-junctive, to ſave his
Bond. In both caſes the Condition refers to the manner of
the aſſurance; and it muſt be made in ſuch manner as the
words of the Condition import. So he ſaid he was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
againſt the Plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wyndham.</hi> Where the Condition of an Obligation is in
the disjunctive, the Obligor muſt have his Election. But in
this caſe there is no ſuch thing as a disjunctive, till ſuch time
as there be a requeſt made to ſeal a Deed of Annuity; and
then the Obligor will have an Election, either to execute the
aſſurance, or to pay the 300 <hi>l.</hi> but no ſuch requeſt being made,
it ſhould ſeem that the Obligor muſt pay the 300 <hi>l.</hi> at his

diverſities between this caſe and that. 1. There was no new
publication. 2. In this caſe <hi>Robert</hi> the Father, and <hi>Robert</hi>
the Son are cognominous. He cited <hi>Dyer 142, 143. Trevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians

                     <hi>North &amp; Atkyns.</hi> Without queſtion <hi>Robert</hi> the Grand-child
ſhall take by this Will. If he never had had a Son called
<hi>Robert,</hi> or if <hi>Robert</hi> the Son had been dead at the time of
making the Will, the Grand-child would then without diſpute
have taken by theſe words. Now a new publication is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
to a new writing. The Grand-child is not directly
within the words of the Will; but they are applicable to him.
He is a Son, though he be not begotten by the body of the
deviſor himſelf. He is a Son with a diſtinction. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
is called the Son of <hi>David,</hi> though there were 28 Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
betwixt <hi>David</hi> and him. And a republication may
impoſe another ſenſe upon words, different from what they
had, when they were firſt written; as, if a man deviſe all his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62849:141"/>
Lands in <hi>Dale,</hi> and have but two Acres in <hi>Dale;</hi> the words
now extend to no more then thoſe two Acres: and if he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
more, and dye without any new publication, the new
purchaſed Lands will not paſs. But if there were a new pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
after the purchaſe, they would then paſs well enough.
If a man has iſſue two Sons called <hi>Thomas;</hi> and he makes
a deviſe to his Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> this may be aſcertained by an
averment. Now ſuppoſe that <hi>Thomas</hi> the deviſeé dye living
the Father, and afterward the Father publiſheth his Will
anew, and ſays that he did intend that his Son <hi>Thomas</hi>
now dead, ſhould have had his Land; but now his Will and
intent is, that <hi>Thomas</hi> his younger Son now living ſhall take
his Land by the ſame Will. In this caſe, to be ſure the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Son <hi>Thomas</hi> ſhall take by the deviſe. Here the import
of the words is clearly altered by the republication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atkyns.</hi> The words of this Will would not of themſelves
be ſufficient to carry the Land to the Grand-child, nor would
the intention of the Deviſor do it without them: but both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
do the buſineſs. <hi>Quae non proſunt ſingula, juncta

                     <hi>Nudigate pro Querente.</hi> This Statute is in the nature
of a penal Law; becauſe it reſtrains the liberty which the
Plaintiff has by the Common Law, to bring his Action
when he will: and muſt therefore be conſtrued beneficia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the Plaintiff: <hi>Pl. 54. Cr. Car. 294. Finche &amp;
Lambe's caſe:</hi> to this purpoſe. Alſo this exception of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
between Merchants and their Factors, muſt be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
expounded for their benefit; becauſe the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
in making ſuch an exception, had an eye to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of Trade and Commerce. The words of
the exception are <hi>(other then ſuch Accounts as concern
the Trade of Merchandiſe, &amp;c.)</hi> now this Action of ours
is not indeed an Action of Account; but it is an Action
grounded upon an Account. And the Plaintiff being at
liberty to bring either the one or the other upon the ſame
cauſe of Action, and one of the Actions being excepted
expreſly out of the limitation of the Statute, the other
by Equity is excepted alſo. He cited <hi>Hill. 17 Car. 1. in
Marſhe's Reports, 151. &amp; Jones 401. Sandys &amp; Blodwell:
Mich. 13 Car.</hi> 1. and prayed Iudgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serjeant Baldwin contra.</hi> He ſaid it did not appear in
the Declaration, that this Action was betwixt a Merchant
and his Factor; ſo that then the plea in bar is <hi>prima
facie</hi> good. And when he comes and ſets it forth in his
Replication, he is too late in it: and the replication is not
purſuant to his Declaration.</p>
                  <p>But all the Court was againſt him in this. Then he
ſaid the Statute excepted Actions of Account only; and
not Actions upon an <hi>indeb. Aſſumpſit.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cur'.</hi> Whereas it has been ſaid by <hi>Serjeant Nudigate,</hi>
that the Plaintiff here has an Election to bring an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of account, or an <hi>Indebitat. Aſſumpſit,</hi> that is falſe:
for till the Account be ſtated betwixt them, an Action of
Account lies, and not an Action upon the Caſe. When
the Account is once ſtated, then an Action upon the caſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62849:142"/>
lies, and not an Action of Account. <hi>Et per North,</hi> if
upon an <hi>Indebitat. Aſſumpſit</hi> matters are offered in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that lie in account, I do not allow them to be
given in evidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>North, Wyndham &amp; Scroggs:</hi> the exception of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
goes only to Actions of Account, and not to other
Actions. And we take a diverſity betwixt an account cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and an account ſtated. After the account ſtated, the
certainty of the Debt appears, and all the intricacy of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
is out of doors: and the Action muſt be brought
within ſix years after the account ſtated. But by <hi>North,</hi>
if after an account ſtated, upon the ballance of it a ſum
appear due to either of the parties, which ſum is not paid,
but is afterward thrown into a new account between the
ſame parties, it is now ſlip't out of the Statute again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scroggs.</hi> The Statute makes a difference betwixt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon Account, and Actions upon the caſe. The words
would elſe have been, <hi>All Actions of Account, and upon
the Caſe, other then ſuch Actions as concern the Trade of
Merchandiſe.</hi> But it is otherwiſe penned; <hi>other then ſuch
Accounts as concern, &amp;c.</hi> and as this caſe is, there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
betwixt the parties; the account is determined, and the
Plaintiff put to his Action upon an <hi>inſimul computaſſet:</hi> which
is not within the benefit of the exception.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Atkyns.</hi> I think the makers of this Statute had a greater
regard to the perſons of Merchants, then the cauſes of Action
between them. And the reaſon was, becauſe they are often
out of the Realm, and cannot always proſecute their Actions
in due time. The Statute makes no difference betwixt an
account current, and an account ſtated. I think alſo that no
other ſort of Tradeſmen, but Merchants are within the benefit
of this exception: and that it does not extend to Shop-kéep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
they not being within the ſame miſchief. <hi>Adjurnatur.</hi>

and by the conſtruction of the Will it ſhall go to
the Executor, for by <hi>ceaſe</hi> in the Will is meant <hi>ceaſe</hi> as to the

The Plaintiff replies, and ſets forth an Award made upon
the ſaid 19. <hi>of February,</hi> by an Vmpire choſen by the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and alledges a breach thereof. The Defendant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sanders</hi> for the Defendant. Here is no breach of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

the Vmpires Award, it following thoſe words, <hi>Then
the Obligation ſhall be void,</hi> is no part of the Condition;
and if any Action is to be brought upon that part, it ought
to be Covenant. 2. The Award made by the Vmpire is void,
becauſe made the 19. <hi>of February,</hi> which was within the time
limited to the Arbitrators, for their power, and the Vmpire
could not make an award within that time, becauſe their power

that the Obligor ſhould releaſe:</hi> And it was adjudged
here, That the laſt was a part of the Condition. I was at
the Bar when the Caſe betwixt <hi>Barnard</hi> and <hi>King</hi> was ſpoken
to, and I know <hi>Roll</hi> did hold and deliver then, That if it
had been alledged, that the Arbitrators had wholly denied and
deſerted their power, it had let in the Vmpire, ſo as that he
might account within the time allowed to the Arbitrators,
and he ſtood upon this then, that it was implicitely alledged,
<hi>viz. Poſtquam denegaſſent, &amp;c.</hi> But this was a hard Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that the award in the Caſe at the Bar is naught. For
the authority of the Arbitrators was not determined till after
the <hi>19th of February.</hi> For Iuſtice <hi>Croke</hi> goes ſo far, 1 <hi>Cr.
263.</hi> as to agree, That Arbitrators may nominate an Vmpire
within the time for their making their award. So that the
chuſing the Vmpire doth not extinguiſh their authority, and
therefore the Vmpire could not make an award upon this <hi>19th
of February.</hi> It is true the Arbitrators might chuſe him upon
that day, or before. But, yet ſtill they might have made an

the allegation of the King, that the Advowſon was in groſs,

that Caſe the King might wave the traverſe tendered to his

the Office puts the King in actual poſſeſſion; for where the

Reſolved, That the King might maintain the Inquiſition, that

to the Forfeiture by a Record. The difference is, where
the King is Actor, as here he is, being out of poſſeſſion, he
muſt make a Title, and prove it. But where the party
is Actor he cannot fix upon his own Title, and force the King
to make good his own Title, 34 <hi>H. 8. Br. Prerog. 116. Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's
Caſe</hi> is full in point. In an Information <hi>tam quam,</hi>
if the Defendant traverſe, the King cannot wave the iſſue ſo
tendered. One Reaſon indeed given is, becauſe the King is
not ſole party. But the chief reaſon is, becauſe the King is
not intituled by matter of Record: For ſaith the Book, There
is no Office found before the Information. But upon a
traverſe of an Office, <hi>&amp; hujuſmodi,</hi> ſaith the Book, the King
may do it, becauſe he is intituled by matter of Record; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in our Caſe the King ſhall not wave the iſſue tendered,
&amp;c. and fly upon the matter of the Defendants Title.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Archer accordant.</hi> It muſt be admitted, that in this Caſe
the King muſt make a Title, becauſe by preſenting of <hi>Tim.
White</hi> and alſo of <hi>Hinkley</hi> the Defendant, the which was
nine years ſince, he is put to his <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> and is out
of poſſeſſion, I do not ſay of the Inheritance, though that
hath been a queſtion in the old Books, <hi>V. 2. Cr.</hi> 53. But
it has been adjudged, That the Inheritance cannot be gained
or deveſted out of the King by any Vſurpations, 2 <hi>Cr. 123.
3 Cr. 241. &amp;</hi> 519. and <hi>Green's, 6 Co. 30. a.</hi> But that he may
grant away the Inheritance of the Advowſons ſtill, &amp;c. But
it is as clear, and agreéd by all thoſe Books, <hi>and Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's
Caſe, 6 Co.</hi> 49, 50. that in ſuch caſe, he muſt bring a
<hi>Quare Impedit</hi> to recover the Preſentation, for he is put out
of poſſeſſion of that. For as my <hi>Lord Hob.</hi> 322. obſerves,
it is one of the things, whereupon Vſurpation works more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
than upon other poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p>Now he that is thus out of poſſeſſion, and put to his <hi>Quare
Impedit,</hi> muſt always make a Title to himſelf in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<hi>Hob.</hi> 102. and this the Defendant cannot counterplead,
but by conveighing a Title to himſelf, and ſo avoiding the
Plaintiffs alledged Title, by traverſe, or confeſſing and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Hob</hi> 163. Now here the Defendant hath done what

he muſt recover by his own ſtrength, not by the Defendants

has cloſed up the King, ſo as that he ought to take iſſue, and
maintain his own Title. <hi>V. 2 Cr.</hi> 651. I ſay therefore, That
the Kings declining his own Title, and falling upon the
others, is a departure, which is matter of ſubſtance, and it
would make pleading infinite, therefore the demurrer in this
Caſe is good, 1 <hi>Cr.</hi> 105. is in point; and ſo is <hi>Hobart's</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in <hi>Digby verſus Fitzherbert,</hi> 103. 104. and though the
Iudges are two and two in that Caſe, as it is there reported,
yet the whole Court agreed it afterwards.</p>
                  <p>So that, were this a common perſons Caſe, I ſuppoſe it
would be agreed on all hands. But it is inſiſted, that this
is one of the Kings Prerogatives, that when his Title is
traverſed by the party, he may either maintain his own Title
againſt the traverſe of the party, or traverſe the affirmative
of the party, <hi>Paſch. pr. C. 243. a. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is true, this is there reckoned up among many
other Prerogatives of the King. But, firſt, with reverence,
ſeveral of them are judged no Law, as that if the King have
Title by Lapſe, and he ſuffer another to preſent an Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,
who dies, the King ſhall yet preſent, is counter-judged,
3 <hi>Cr.</hi> 44. and both that and the next following point
too, 7 <hi>Co. 28. a.</hi> Secondly, In the ſame Caſe, <hi>fol.</hi> 236.
there is a good Rule given, which we may make uſe of in
our Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common Law doth ſo admeaſure the
Kings Title and Prerogatives, as that they ſhall not take
away, nor prejudice any mans Inheritance. <hi>V. 19 E. 4. 9.
11 H. 4. 37. 13 E. 4. 8. 28 H. 6. 2. 9 H. 4. 6. F. N. B.</hi> 152.
Now my Brother <hi>Wild</hi> hath given the true Anſwer, that
when the Kings Title appears to the Court upon Record,
that Record ſo intitles the King, that by his Prerogative he
may either defend his own, or fall upon the other's Title. For
in all Caſes where the King either by traverſe, as 24 <hi>E. 3.
30. pl. 27. Keil.</hi> 172. 192. or otherwiſe, as by ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer,
<hi>E. 3. Fitz. monſt. de Faits</hi> 172. falls upon a Defendants
Title, It muſt be underſtood, that the King is intitled by
Record, and ſometimes it is remembred, and mentioned in
the Caſe, <hi>Fitz.</hi> 34. That the King is in as by Office, &amp;c. But
<hi>Br. Preg.</hi> 116. the Kings Attorney doth confeſs the Law to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:62849:146"/>
be ſo expreſly, that the King has not this Prerogative, but
where he is entitled by matter of Record.</p>
                  <p>Before 21 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 2. when the Kings Titles was found by
any Inquiſition, or Preſentment by virtue of Commiſſions to
find out concealments, defective Titles, &amp;c. he exerciſed this
Prerogative of falling upon, and traverſing the parties Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and much to the prejudice of the Subjects, whoſe Titles
are often ſo ancient and obſcure, as they could not well be
made out. Now that Statute was made to cure this defect,
and took away the ſeverity of that Prerogative; Ordaining,
that the King ſhould not ſue, or impeach any perſon for his
Lands, &amp;c. unleſs the Kings Titles had béen duly in charge
to that <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> or had ſtood <hi>inſuper</hi> of Record
within 30 years before the beginning of that Parliament, &amp;c.
<hi>Hob.</hi> 118. 9. the King takes Iſſue upon the Defendants Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of his Title, and could the King do otherwiſe, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
would be very great, as my Brother obſerved, both to
the Patron and Incumbent. The Law takes notice of this,
and had a jealouſie, that falſe Titles would be ſet on foot for
the King: and therefore 25 <hi>Edw. 3. St. 3. Car. 7. &amp; 13 R. 2.
Car. 1. &amp; 4 H. 4. Ca.</hi> 22. enables the Ordinary and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
to counterplead the Kings Title, and to defend, ſue,
and recover againſt it. But <hi>a fortiori</hi> at Common Law the
Patron, who by his Endowment had this Inheritance, might
controvert, and Traverſe the Kings Title; and it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and miſchievous, that the Crowns poſſeſſions by Lapſe,
or, it may be, the meer ſuggeſting a Title for the King, ſhould
put the Patron to ſhew, and maintain his Title, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
his Title is very long, conſiſting of 20 <hi>meſne Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances;</hi>
and the King may Traverſe any one of them: <hi>Keil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
192. b. Pl.</hi> 3. I conclude, I think the King ought to
have taken Iſſue, and he not doing it, the Demurrer is good:
and that the Defendant ought to have Iudgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tyrrell contra.</hi> I am not ſatisfied but here is a Diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
For the Defendant pleads the Appendency of the Church
only, not the Chappel. It is true, he traverſeth, that the
Queen was not ſeized of both.</p>
                  <p>I deny what is affirmed, that the King by his Preſentation
of <hi>Timothy White,</hi> and the preſent Incumbent, is out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.
By the Iudgment of reverſal, 2 <hi>Cr.</hi> 123. 4. the Law
at this day is, that he cannot be put out of poſſeſſion of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:62849:147"/>
by 20 uſurpations. A <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> is an Action of
Poſſeſſion; and if he were out of poſſeſſion, how could he
bring it? As to this Traverſe, It is a common Erudition,
that a party ſhall not depart, and that there ſhall not be a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi>
upon a <hi>Traverſe.</hi> But the King is excepted: 5 <hi>Co. 104.
Pl. C. 243. a Br. Petition 22. Prerogatives 59, 60, 69. &amp;</hi> 116.
It is agreéd, where the King is in poſſeſſion, and where he is
intitled by matter of Record, he may take a <hi>Traverſe upon a
Traverſe.</hi> And there is no Book ſays, that where he is in by
matter of Fact, he cannot do it. Indeed there is ſome kind
of pregnancy at leaſt in the laſt of thoſe Authorities. But I
will cite two caſes, on which I will rely: <hi>viz. 19 E. 3. Fitz
monſtr. de faits,</hi> 172. which is our caſe. The King in a <hi>Quare
Impedit</hi> makes Title by reaſon of Awardſhip, whereby he had
the cuſtody of the Mannor, to which the Advowſon belonged,
and that the Father dyed ſeiſed thereof, &amp;c. and there is not a
word that his Tytle was by matter of Record. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
pleads, that the Father of a Ward made a Feoffment
of the Mannor to him for life, and afterwards releaſed all his
right, &amp;c. ſo that the Father had nothing therein at the time of
his death, and that after his death, he the Defendant enfeoffed
two men, &amp;c. and took back an Eſtate to himſelf for 10 years,
which term yet continues, and ſo it belongs to him to preſent.
But he did not ſhew the releaſe, but demurred in Iudgment
upon this, that he ought not to ſhew the releaſe; and the King
departs from his <hi>Count,</hi> and inſiſts upon that which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
had confeſſed, that he had made a Feoffme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not ſhewn by the releaſe, as he ought to make himſelf more
then Tenant for life, was a Forfeiture, and therefore the heir
had cauſe to enter, and the King in his right, and thereupon
prays Iudgment; and has a Writ to the Biſhop. <hi>Cook 86.
7. 1 Inſt. 304. b.</hi> The other caſe is 24 <hi>Ed. 3. 30. Pl.</hi> 27. which
is our very caſe. The King brings a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> for a
Church appendant to a Mannor, as a Guardian, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
makes a Title, and traverſeth the Title alledged by the
King in his Count, <hi>viz.</hi> the appendancy, the King replies,
and Traverſes the Defendants Title. For this cauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
demurs, and Iudgment was for the King. In this
caſe it doth not appear in the pleading, that the King was in
by matter of Record, and ſo it is our very caſe. For the
King may be in by poſſeſſion by virtue of a Wardſhip, without
matter of Record by Entry, &amp;c. <hi>Stamf. Prerog.</hi> 54. I rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:62849:147"/>
theſe two Caſes. But 7 <hi>H. 8. Keil.</hi> 175. is ſomewhat to
the purpoſe; <hi>Per Fitz.</hi> In a Raviſhment of Ward by the King,
if the Defendant make a Title, and traverſe the Kings Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
the Kings Attorney may maintain the Kings Title, and
Traverſe the Defendants Title. I think there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwéen the Kings being in poſſeſſion by matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and by matter of Fact.</p>
                  <p>Again, If matter of Record be neceſſary, here is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
<hi>viz.</hi> The Queens Preſentation under the Great
Seal of <hi>England.</hi> And here is a deſcent, which is and
muſt be <hi>Jure Coronae.</hi> It is unreaſonable, that a Subject
ſhould turn the King out of poſſeſſion by him that hath
no Title. This is a Prerog. Caſe. As to the Statutes
objected by my Brother <hi>Archer,</hi> they concern not this caſe.
The firſt enables the Patron to counterplead. But, here
the Patron pleads.</p>
                  <p>The reſt concern the Kings Preſenting <hi>En auter droit.</hi>
But here it is in his own Right. I think the King in our
caſe may fly upon the Defendants Title, and there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
in it. For the Kings Title is not a bare ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.
For, it is confeſſed by the Defendant, that the
Quéen did Preſent: But, he alledges it was by Lapſe.</p>
                  <p>For another reaſon, I think Iudgment ought to be for the
King, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Defendant has committed the firſt
fault. For his Bar is naught, in that he has traverſed the
Queens <hi>Seiſin in Groſſe;</hi> whereas he ought to have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
the Queens Preſentment <hi>modo &amp; forma.</hi> For where
the Title is by a <hi>Seiſin in Groſſe,</hi> it is repugnant to admit
the Preſentment, and deny the <hi>Seiſin in Groſſe;</hi> becauſe the
Preſentment makes it a <hi>Seiſin in Groſſe. 10 H. 7. 27. Pl.</hi> 7.
in point, and ſo is my <hi>Lord Buckhurſt's Caſe in 1 Leonard</hi> 154.
The traverſe here is a matter of ſubſtance. But if it be but
Form, it is all one. For the King is not within the Statute
27 <hi>El. cap.</hi> 5. So he concluded that Iudgment ought to be
given for the King.</p>

therefore not guilty of the Treſpaſs. But, perhaps if it had

whereas <hi>W. Maynard,</hi> one of the Witneſſes for the Plaintiff, was
guilty, as appeared by his own Evidence, together with the
Defendants, but was left out of the Declaration, that he
might be a Witneſs for the Plaintiff, that he was a good and
legal Witneſs; but his credit was leſſened by it, for that he
ſwore in his own diſcharge. For that when theſe Defendants
ſhould be convicted, and have ſatisfied the Condemnation, he
might plead the ſame in Bar of an Action brought againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                  <p>Several witneſſes were received and allowed, to prove that

not help it; for though my Lord Chief Baron ſaid it were
well, if the Law were otherwiſe, yet he and we all agreed that
a Bill of Exchange accepted, &amp;c. was indeed a good ground
for a ſpecial Action upon the caſe: but that it did not make a
Debt; firſt, becauſe the acceptance is but conditional on both
ſides. If the money be not received, it returns back upon
the drawer of the Bill. He remains liable ſtill, and this is
but collateral. Secondly, becauſe the word <hi>Onerabilis</hi> doth
not imply Debt. Thirdly, Becauſe the caſe is <hi>primae Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis:</hi>
there was no Preſident for it. Then <hi>Offley</hi> who was

of Council for the Plaintiff in the Exchequer caſe, and that
therein direction was given to ſearch Preſidents; and that
they did ſearch in this Court, and in <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and that there

have the ſame power of diſcharging upon complaint of the

might have applyed himſelf to the Seſſions. For the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

                     <hi>Jones pro Defendent<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 1. It is conſiderable, whether an
Action will lie againſt a Feme upon a Covenant in a Fine
levied by her, when <hi>Covert-Baron.</hi> It would be inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that Land ſhould be unalienable, and therefore the Law
enables a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> to levy a Fine. Which Fine ſhall
work by <hi>Eſtoppel,</hi> and paſs againſt her a good Intereſt. But
to make her liable to a perſonal Action thereupon, to anſwer
damages, &amp;c. it were hard, and it is <hi>Caſus primae impreſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi>
For the Plaintiff it was ſaid, there is little queſtion but
an Action of Covenant will well lie upon this warranty. The
Law enables a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> to corroborate the Eſtate ſhe
paſſes, and to do all things incident. If ſhe levy a Fine of
her Inheritance, ſhe may be <hi>vouched,</hi> or a <hi>Warrantia Chartae,
&amp;c.</hi> thereupon be had againſt her, and ſo is <hi>Roll verſus Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
Hob.</hi> 20. and if ſhe can thus bind her Land, <hi>a fortiori</hi>
ſhe may ſubject her ſelf to a Covenant, as in the Caſe at
the Bar. If a Husband and Wife make a Leaſe for years,
and ſhe accept the rent after his death, ſhe ſhall be liable to a
Covenant.</p>
                  <p>This Point was agreed by the Council on both ſides,
that a Covenant in this Caſe would lie againſt her, and ſo
this Court agreéd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twiſd.</hi> added, That there was no queſtion but a Covenant
would lie upon a Fine. For (ſaith he) ſealing is not always
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:62849:153"/>
neceſſary to found an Action of Covenant. Thus Covenant
lies againſt the Kings Leſſeé by Patent, upon his Covenant in
the Patent, though we know there is no ſealing by the ſaid
Leſſée.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was urged on the Defendants behalf, That the
breach of Covenant is not well aſſigned, for it is not ſhewed

<hi>Habens Legale, &amp;c.</hi> but what is ſaid, is altogether general and
uncertain: <hi>Jus &amp; Legalem titulum ad tenementa praed',</hi> ſo that

praedictis, unde dimiſſionem praedictam facere potuit.</hi>
The Defendant replies, <hi>Quod habuit, &amp;c.</hi> in general, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſhewing in ſpecial what Eſtate he had, that ſo it might
appear to the Court, that he had ſufficient in the Lands
whereout to make the Leaſe; and therefore the Replication
was adjudged naught. It is true, it was adjudged, That
after the Verdict, it was helped by the <hi>Stat. of Jeoffails.</hi> But
that I conceive was, becauſe the iſſue, though not very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,
yet was upon the main point, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Leſſor
had an Eſtate in the Tenements or no. For the true reaſon
why a Verdict doth help in ſuch a Caſe, is, becauſe it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that the matter left out, was given in Evidence, and
that the Iudges did direct accordingly; or elſe the Verdict
could not have been found. So in our Caſe, If the iſſue had
béen, Whether <hi>Stowell</hi> had Right, &amp;c. it might have been
ſuppoſed and intended by his ſpecial Title and Eſtate made
out and proved by trial. But here the iſſue going off on a
Collateral point, it cannot be intended, that any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was given in Evidence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Pollexfen</hi> for the Plaintiff. This Objection is
againſt all the Precedents, by which it appears, that alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
generally as we do, <hi>habens Legale Jus &amp; Titulum</hi> is good.
It is ſufficient for a man to alledge, that the Covenantor
had no power to demiſe, or was not ſeized, &amp;c. without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any cauſe why, or that any other perſon was ſeized, &amp;c.

Thirdly, <hi>Saunders</hi> for the Defendant ſaid, Though the
Plaintiff was very wary, bringing in the Right of <hi>Stowell</hi>
with a Participle only, ſo that we could not take iſſue upon
it; we could only <hi>proteſt:</hi> yet I agreed, that having taken
iſſue upon one Point, we muſt admit, and do admit the reſt
of the matter in the Declaration. But that is only as it is
alledged. Now here therefore we muſt admit, that <hi>Stowell</hi>
had Right and Title, &amp;c. But we do not admit that he had
a Title precedent to this Fine, or had right otherwiſe than
from and under the Plaintiff himſelf; for that is not alledged.
And it ſhall never be intended, no not after Verdict, that <hi>Stowell</hi>
had good and <hi>Eigne</hi> Right and Title, before the Leaſe grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Fine, but the contrary ſhall be intended. And for
that I rely upon <hi>Kirby verſus Hanſaker, 2 Cr.</hi> 315. By all
Iudges of <hi>C. B.</hi> and <hi>Scacc<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Cam. Scacc<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> in Point. Nay that is
a ſtronger Caſe than ours is. For there the iſſue which was
found for the Plaintiff, was, that the Recovery by <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who
anſwers to <hi>Stowell</hi> in our Caſe, was not by Covin, but by
lawful Title. And yet, becauſe it was not alledged, that he
had a good and <hi>Eigne</hi> Title, it was held to be ill, and not
helped, and the Iudgment was reverſed. The ſaying that
<hi>Stowell</hi> ejected him, &amp;c. <hi>Contra formam &amp; effectum Finis &amp;
Warrant<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praed',</hi> or if it had been <hi>Contra formam &amp; effectum
Conventionis praed',</hi> is abſurd, and helps nothing. For
<hi>Stowell</hi> could not do ſo, becauſe he is not party to the
Fine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jones</hi> for the Plaintiff. It can never be intended that
<hi>Stowell</hi> entred, &amp;c. by a Title under us, becauſe it is alledg'd
to be <hi>Contra formam, &amp; effectum Finis &amp; Warrant' praed', &amp;
Contra voluntatem ipſius J. W. &amp; eum a poſſeſſione ſua Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divit,
&amp;c.</hi> had it been by Leaſe under us, the Defendant
ſhould have pleaded it. I doubt whether the Defendant
could have demurred. But certainly, now the Iury have
found all this, it can never be intended as they would have
it: as to the Caſe, that has beén cited, between <hi>Kirby</hi> and
<hi>Hanſaker;</hi> I ſay it is not ſo clearly alledged there, as here:
It is not ſaid there, that the Leſſeé was poſſeſſed, and that
the Recoveror entred into, and upon his Poſſeſſions; and
ejected him. 2. Theſe words <hi>Contra formam, &amp;c.</hi> are not
in that Caſe. 3. In that Caſe the Court of Kings Bench
was of Opinion, That the Verdict had made it good.
4. The Roll of that Caſe is not to be found, here is a man
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:62849:154"/>
will make Oath that he hath ſearched four years before and
after the time when that Caſe is ſuppoſed to have been and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rainsford</hi> and <hi>Moreton</hi> were at firſt of Opinion, That the
Verdict had helped it. For ſaith <hi>Rainsford,</hi> If <hi>Stowell</hi> had
Title under the Plaintiff, it could not have been found, that
there was a breach of Covenant. But afterwards they ſaid,
that <hi>Kirby</hi> and <hi>Hanſaker's Caſe</hi> came ſo cloſe to it, that it was
not to be avoided, and they were unwilling to make new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twiſden.</hi> That Book is ſo expreſs'd, that it is not an
ordinary authority, it is not to be waved. But I was of
the ſame Opinion, before that Book was cited. For here it
is poſſible <hi>Stowell</hi> might have a Leaſe from <hi>Wootton</hi> ſince
the Fine. Now the warranty doth not extend to <hi>Puiſne
Titles.</hi> The Defendant ſhould have ſaid that <hi>Stowell</hi> had
<hi>Priorem Titulum, &amp;c.</hi> when a good Title is not ſet forth in
the Declaration to entitle the Plaintiff to his Action, it ſhall
never be helped. There was an Action upon the <hi>Stat. of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,</hi>
for that the Defendant entred, I ſuppoſe, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of ſome <hi>Monopoly-Commiſſion, &amp;c. &amp; detinuit</hi> certain
goods. But it was not ſaid, they were his the Plaintiffs,
and though we had a Verdict, yet we could never have Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>In 3 Car.</hi> there was an Action brought upon a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to give ſo much with a Child, <hi>quantum daret</hi> to any
other Child; and it was alledged, that <hi>dedit</hi> ſo much, and
becauſe that that it might be before the time of the promiſe,
it was held naught after Verdict.</p>
                  <p>It may be the <hi>Roll of Kirby verſus Hanſaker</hi> is not to be
found, no more than the Roll of <hi>Middleton verſus Cleſman,</hi>

ſuch Caſes, unleſs there had been ſuch. There are

where will you find the Roll of the Decreé for Titles in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
yet I have heard the Iudges ſay, They verily believe it
is upon a wrong Roll.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreton.</hi> I take the Law to be, that where an Infant
ſues with others <hi>in auter droit,</hi> as here, he ſhall ſue by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney;
for all of them together repreſent the Teſtator. I
ground my ſelf upon the Authorities, which have been cited,
and <hi>Yelv.</hi> 130. Alſo it is for the Infants advantage to ſue
by Attorney. But if he be a Defendant he may appear by
Guardian, <hi>Popham</hi> 112.</p>
                  <p>I think the parties may all joyn in this ſuit, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>in Hatton verſus Maskew</hi> they could not: For in that
Caſe it appeared that the wife only, who was Plaintiff, was
Executrix. So he concluded, that Iudgment ought to be
given for the Plaintiffs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rainsford accordant.</hi> This Caſe is ſtronger than where a
ſingle perſon is made Executor or Adminiſtrator. For though
<hi>Ro. 288. num.</hi> 2. makes a <hi>Quaere</hi> of that, yet <hi>Num.</hi> 3. which
is our Caſe, he agrees clearly with the <hi>Counteſs of Rutlands
Caſe, in 3 Cr.</hi> 377. 8. That the Infant as well as the other
Executors ſhall ſue by Attorney. The Reaſons objected on
the contrary are, That an Infant cannot make an Attorney,
and that he may be prejudiced hereby. I anſwer, That
the Executors of full age have influence upon the Infants,
and they are entruſted to order and manage the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.<note place="margin">V. 1 Leon 74.</note>
And therefore Adminiſtration <hi>durante minoritate</hi> ſhall
not be granted, ſo in this Caſe, he ſhall have priviledge
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:62849:155"/>
to ſue by Attorney, becauſe he is accompanied with thoſe
which are of full age. I conclude, I have not heard of any
Authority againſt my Opinion: and how we can go over all
the Authorities cited for it, I do not know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twiſden contra.</hi> This is an Action upon the Caſe, for that
the Defendant was indebted for damages clear received to
the Teſtator's Vſe. And indeed, I do not ſée otherwiſe, how
it would lie. Two queſtions have been made: Firſt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
all the Executors may, or muſt joyn? I confeſs I have
heard nothing againſt this, <hi>viz.</hi> but that they may joyn. But
I cannot ſo eaſily as my Brothers ſlubber over all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
cited <hi>(viz.) Hatton verſus Maskew,</hi> which, I confeſs,
is a full authority for this that they need not joyn. The Caſe
was thus; The Teſtator recovers a Iudgment, and dies,
making his Will thus. Alſo, I deviſe the reſidue of my Eſtate
to my two Daughters, and my Wife, whom I make my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutrix.
I confeſs I cannot tell why, but the Spiritual Court
did judge them all, both the two Daughters, as well as the
Wife, to be Executrices; and therefore we the Iudges muſt
take them to be ſo. The Wife alone proves the Will with a
<hi>reſervata poteſtate</hi> to the Daughters, when they ſhould come
in. But this makes nothing at all in this Caſe; I think
this is according to their uſual form. The Wife alone ſues
a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon this Iudgment, and therein ſets forth
this whole matter, <hi>viz.</hi> that there were two other Executrices,
which were under <hi>ſeventeen, &amp;c.</hi> It was adjudged for the
Plaintiff, and affirmed in a Writ of Errour <hi>in Cam. Scacc<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
that the <hi>Scire facias</hi> was well brought by her alone. But firſt,
I cannot ſee how a Writ of Errour ſhould lie in that Caſe
<hi>in Cam. Scacc<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> For it is not a Cauſe within 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. What
reaſon is there for Iudgment? a reaſon may be given, that
before an Executor comes <hi>to ſeventeen,</hi> he is no Executor.
But I ſay he is <hi>quoad eſſe,</hi> though not <hi>quoad Excecutionem.</hi>
A Wife Adminiſtratrix under <hi>ſeventeen</hi> ſhall joyn with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in an Action; and why ſhall not the Infants as well in
our Caſe? <hi>Yelv.</hi> 130. is expreſs that the Infant muſt joyn,
and be named. It is clear, that no Adminiſtration <hi>durante
minore aetate</hi> can be committed in this Caſe. For all the
Executors make but one perſon, and therefore why may not
all joyn? 2. Admitting they may joyn, whether the Infants
may ſue by Attorney? I hold that in no Caſe an Infant ſhall
ſue or be ſued either in his own, or <hi>auter droit,</hi> by Attorney.

for the Infant in that Caſe, to appear otherwiſe than by a
Guardian. 4. That the Errour was not helped by the <hi>Statute
of Jeoffails.</hi> In a Caſe between <hi>Colt &amp; Sherwood, Mich.
1649.</hi> an Infant Adminiſtrator ſued and appeared <hi>per Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianum;</hi>
and it appeared upon the Record that he was above
<hi>ſeventeen</hi> years of age. I was of Council in it, and we inſiſted
it was Errour, but it was adjudged, That he appeared as
he ought to appear; and that he ought not to appear by
Attorney. And the Reaſons given were; Firſt, Becauſe an
Infant cannot make an Attorney by reaſon of his inability.
Secondly, Becauſe by this means an Infant might be
amerced <hi>pro falſo Clamore.</hi> For when he appears by Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<hi>non conſtat;</hi> unleſs it happen to be ſpecially ſet forth, that
he is an Infant, and ſo he is amerced at all adventures;
and to relieve himſelf againſt this he has no remedy, but
by a Writ of Errour. For Errour in Fact cannot be aſſignd
<hi>ore tenus.</hi> And it were well worth the Coſt to bring a Writ
of Errour to take off an amercement.</p>
                  <p>But it is ſaid, That the Infants may appear by Attorney
in this Caſe, becauſe they are coupled and joyned in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with thoſe of full age. I think that makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
for that reaſon would make ſuch appearance good,
in caſe that they were all Defendants. But it is agreed,
That if an Infant be Defendant with others who are of full
age, he cannot appear by Attorney. The reaſon is the ſame
in both Caſes. If an Infant and two men of full age joyn
in a Feoffment, and make a Letter of Attorney, &amp;c. this
is not good, nor can in any ſort take away the imbecility which
the Law makes in an Infant.</p>
                  <p>I conclude, I think the Plaintiffs ought to joyn; but the
Infants ought to appear by Guardian. But ſince my two
Brothers are of another mind, as to the laſt Point, there muſt

                     <hi>Nota, Coleman</hi> argued for the Defendant; his Argument,
which ought to have been inſerted above, was to this effect:
Firſt, Theſe five cannot joyn; had there been but one Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
and he under <hi>ſeventeen</hi> years, the Adminiſtrator <hi>durant<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
minor<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> ought to have brought the Action, 5 <hi>Co. 29. a.</hi> But
ſince there are ſeveral Executors, and ſome of them of full age,
there can be no Adminiſtration <hi>durant' minor<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Thoſe of full
age muſt Adminiſter for themſelves, and the Infants to. But
the courſe is, that Executors of full age prove the Will, and
the other, that is under age, ſhall not come in till his age of
<hi>ſeventeen</hi> years. But now the queſtion is, How this Action
ſhould have beén brought? I ſay according to the Preſident of
<hi>Hatton verſus Maſkew,</hi> which was in <hi>Cam. Scacc<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Mich. 15 Car.

ſpecially in the Declaration, that there was another Executor
under age. So that they Reſolved, That the Executor of full
age could not bring the Action without naming the others.

to dye without Iſſue, <hi>Then</hi> I give and bequeath it to <hi>George
Porter, viz.</hi> the Defendant. The Earl dyed. <hi>Ann</hi> the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
married <hi>Charles</hi> the Plaintiff, ſhe being then about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fifteen years old, without the conſent of either of the
Truſtees. And thereupon now a Bill was preferred to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
againſt this Condition and Forfeiture, becauſe ſhe had
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:62849:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no notice of this Condition and Limitation made to her,
&amp;c. To this the Defendant had demurred, but that was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled.
Afterwards there were ſeveral Depoſitions, &amp;c. made
and teſtified on each ſide, the effect of which was this. On the
Plaintiffs part it was proved by ſeveral, that it was always
the Earls intention, that the Plaintiff ſhould have this Eſtate,
and that they never heard of this purpoſe to put any Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon her; and believed that he did not intend to give away
the Inheritance from her. But that this Clauſe in the Will
was only <hi>in terrorem,</hi> and Cautionary, to make her the more
obſequious to her Grandmother. The two Earls ſwore that
they had no notice of this Clauſe in the Will; but if they had,
they think it poſſible ſuch reaſons might have been offered, as
might have induced them to give their conſents to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
and that now they do conſent to, and approve of the
ſame. Some proof was made, that the Counteſs of <hi>Newport</hi>
had ſome deſign that the Plaintiff ſhould not have this Eſtate,
but that the Defendant ſhould have it. But at laſt even ſhe,
<hi>(viz.</hi> the Counteſs) was reconciled, and did declare that ſhe
forgave the Plaintiffs Marriage, and that ſhe ſhewed great
affection to a Child which the Plaintiff had, and directed, that
when ſhe was dead, the Plaintiff and her Child ſhould be let
into the poſſeſſion of the premiſſes, and ſhould enjoy them, &amp;c.
It was proved alſo, that when there had been a Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Marriage betweén my Lord <hi>Morpeth</hi> and the
Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff would not marry him, her Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
ſaid ſhe ſhould marry where ſhe would; ſhe would take
no further care about her, (the Counteſs was dead at the time
of this Suit:) It was proved that Mr. <hi>Fry</hi> was of a good
Family, and that the Defendant had 5000 <hi>l.</hi> appointed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for him, by his Grandfather, by the ſame Will.</p>
               <p>On the Defendants part, It was ſworn by the ſaid late
Counteſs of <hi>Newport, viz.</hi> In an anſwer made formerly to
a Bill brought againſt her by the now Defendant for preferring
of Teſtimony (which was ordered to be read) that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was private, and without her conſent and approbation,
and that ſhe did not conceive it to be a fit and proportionable
Marriage, he being a younger Brother, and having no
Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The like was ſworn by the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes
then Husband, and that it appeared ſhe leapt over a
Wall (by means of a Wheel-Barrow ſet up againſt it) to go
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62849:158"/>
to be married, and that as ſoon as the Truſteés did know
of the Marriage, they did diſavow and diſlike it, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
themſelves ſeveral times, and ſaid, That had they had
any hint of it, they would have prevented it.</p>
               <p>Others ſwore that the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> declared upon the
day of her going away, That he never conſented thereto,
and that the Counteſs deſired then, that he would not do any
thing like it, and that the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> ſaid, He would
have loſt one of his Arms rather then have conſented to the
ſaid Marriage.</p>
               <p>On hearing of this Cauſe before the <hi>Maſter of the Rolls,
viz. Sir Harbottle Grimſtone, Baronet,</hi> the Plaintiff obtained
a decretal Order, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>Anne</hi> the Plaintiff and her
Heirs ſhould hold the Premiſſes quietly againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
and his Heirs, and that there ſhould be an Injunction
perpetual againſt the Defendant, and all claiming under
him.</p>
               <p>And now there was an Appeal thereupon, and re-hearing
before <hi>Sir Orlando Bridgman, Knight,</hi> then <hi>Lord-Keeper,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
by the two Lord <hi>Chief Juſtices,</hi> and the <hi>Chief Baron,</hi>
before whom it was argued thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serjeant Maynard.</hi> The Plaintiff ought not to have relief
in this Caſe. The Plaintiffs Mother had a ſufficient provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
by the Earl of <hi>Newport's</hi> Care. And therefore there is
leſs reaſon that this Eſtate ſhould be added to the Daughter.
The noble Lords, the Truſteés, when the thing was freſh,
did diſapprove the Marriage, however they may conſent
thereunto now. The Deviſe was to the Plaintiff, but in
tail, and afterwards to the Defendant. We diſparage
not <hi>Mr. Fry</hi> in blood, nor Family; But people do not
marry for that only, but for Recompence and like For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>There was a publique Fame or Report (it is to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
of this Will in the houſe; and were there not, yet it
was againſt her Duty, and againſt Nature, that ſhe ſhould
decline, asking her Grand-Mothers conſent; and <hi>Mr. Fry</hi> in
Honour and Conſcience ought to have asked it; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this practice ought not to receive the leaſt encouragement
in Equity. 'Tis true, when there was a Demurrer, it was
over-ruled, becauſe the Bill prayed to be relieved againſt a
Forfeiture, for which there might be good cauſe in Equity.
But now it does not appear there is any in the Caſe. The
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62849:158"/>
Eſtate is now in the Defendant, and that not by any act of
his own, but by the Deviſor and the Plaintiff, this is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
not a Condition. For my Lord <hi>Newport</hi> had
Sons; It is ſomewhat of the ſame effect with a Condition,
though it is not ſo. We have a Title by the Will of the
dead, and the act of the other party, without fraud or other
act of us, and therefore it ought not to be defeated.</p>
               <p>I take a difference betweén a deviſe of Land and money.
For Land is not originally deviſable, though Money is. By
the Civil Law, and amongſt civil Lawyers, it has beén made
a queſtion, Whether there ſhall be Relief againſt ſuch a Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in a Deviſe. But be that how it will, Chattels are
ſmall things, but a Freéhold ſetled ought not to be deveſted
thus. No man can make a Limitation in his Will better
and ſtronger to diſappoint his Deviſe, conditionally than this
is made. If my Lord <hi>Newport</hi> had béen alive, would he
have liked ſuch a practice upon his Grand-daughters as want
of Notice? In <hi>Organ's Caſe</hi> and <hi>Sir Julius Caeſar's Caſe,</hi> there
was a Grant to an Infant, on condition to pay 10 <hi>s.</hi> and
no Notice given thereof before 'twas payable; yet becauſe no
body was bound to give notice, it was adjudged againſt the
Infant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Heneage Finch Solicitor General.</hi> The Witneſſes who
ſwear that the Earl ſaid, He would give the Eſtate to her,
prove nothing to the purpoſe. For he did ſo, but upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
That they did not hear. The after-conſent of the
Earls or the Counteſs ought not to make it good; which
conſent at laſt perhaps was extorted by importunity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.
For at firſt they diſapproved the Marriage. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
without conſent, and dying without iſſue, are coupled in
the ſame Line, and the Eſtate ſhall as effectually paſs over to
the Defendant upon the one Limitation as the other.</p>
               <p>For ſuch conſent is matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> and ſuſpitiouſly
to be ſcan'd; For we ought in this Caſe by Law to proceéd
ſtrictly, and not derogate from my Lord <hi>Newport's</hi> intent,
which plainly appears by the letter of his Will, that his
Grand-Child ſhould ask conſent of ſuch, he had thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to conſent before her Marriage were ſolemnized, the
actual ſolemnization of which was an act ſo permanent, that
it would admit of no alteration or diſſolution: An act of ſuch
force and efficacy, tending clearly and immediatly to the
ruine of their Right and Title to the Eſtate in queſtion, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:62849:159"/>
rendring it wholly uncapable of Reviver by any other means
than what the Common and Civil Laws of this Realm do
permit. The poſt-conſent therefore will not avail the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
in this Court. Otherwiſe the Defendant claiming by
this Limitation, ſhould have indeéd advantage, but ſuch as
is inconſiderable, being liable to alteration by the pleaſure of
this Court. And for a ſtrict obſervation of the Teſtators
words, the ſame ought to be in Equity as well as at Law.

               <p>The Counteſs ſaying likely in paſſion, That ſhe might marry
whom ſhe would, &amp;c. did not amount to a dormant Warrant
to her to marry without conſent. I am upon Conjecture
ſtill, that the Plaintiff will inſiſt upon theſe particulars, for
it looks as if they would, becauſe they read them. Doubtleſs
the <hi>primary</hi> intention of the Clauſe was <hi>in terrorem.</hi> But
the <hi>Secondary</hi> was, that if ſhe offended, ſhe ſhould undergo
the penalty. His intention is to be gathered out of the
words only, and what ever they ſay the Earl intended, does
not preſs the Queſtion. Our Frée-hold is ſetled in us by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of an Act of Parliament. I lay it down for a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
That a Father may ſettle his Eſtate; ſo as that the
Iſſue ſhall be deprived of it for Diſobedience, and not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievable
in Equity. And now 'tis not poſſible that any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
could adviſe a man to do it ſtronger than it is done in this
Caſe. And ſhall a Child break theſe Bonds, and look Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
in the face here?<note place="margin">V. 1 Cr. 476. poſt 694. 696.</note> If it had been only provided that

upon this difference are all the Preſidents, and even thoſe of
deviſing portions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> deviſing them over or not, as I
have underſtood. Infancy can be no excuſe in caſe of the
breach of a condition of an Eſtate, in which the Infant is a
Purchaſor. So that nothing reſts now in this Caſe but the
point of <hi>Notice.</hi> And why ſhould not the Infant be bound
to take notice in this Caſe, as he is to take notice in caſe
of a Remainder, wherein he is a Purchaſor? But if notice
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:62849:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be neceſſary, it is not to be tried here now. If we had
brought an Ejectment, and (ſuppoſing notice had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary)
we had failed in the proof thereof, ſhould we have
beén har'd for ever as by this perpetual Injunction we
ſhould be? and ſhall it be done now without proof? If we
are not bound to prove Notice at Law, much leſs are
we bound to prove it here. This Caſe is Epidemical, and
concerns all the Parents of <hi>England</hi> that have or ſhall have
Children, that the Obligations which they lay upon their
Children may not be cancelled wholly, and this Court (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

it. This being of a deviſe Land, and that of Money, which
if it were paid, the Land was to go over. The grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is, That here is an Eſtate veſted by a ſettlement,
which is not to be avoided or defeated. But I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man can lay ſuch a Reſtraint, that there ſhall not be
Relief in any caſe of Emergency and Contingency.<note place="margin">Part 712. 3. V. in Leo. 37.</note> It is
a part of the fundamental Iuſtice of the Nation, that men
ſhould not make Limitations wholly unalterable; as by the
Common Law men cannot make a Feé unalienable. You
give relief every day where there are expreſs Clauſes, that
there ſhall be no relief in Law or Equity, where a thing is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be, &amp;c. without relief in Law or Equity, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
againſt them, and look upon them to be void. In our
Caſe, ſuppoſe ſhe had married a great Lord, or ſuppoſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
had brought notice of the Truſtees conſent? would you
not have given relief? But ſecondly, I deny the Aſſumption.
This Caſe is not ſo. I agrée it had been well done if they had
askt my Lady <hi>Newports</hi> conſent. But is there a word in the
Will, that if the Plaintiff did not, he ſhould have no relief in
Equity? The Eſtate was deviſed to my Lady <hi>Newport</hi> during
her life (ſo that the Plaintiff could not be in poſſeſſion) and <hi>ſhe</hi>
might have lived till the Plaintiff was 21 years old. Could not
my Lady <hi>Newport</hi> have ſaid, <hi>Have a care how you marry,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:62849:160"/>
for you forfeit the Eſtate, if you marry without the conſent
of two of us three?</hi> All Ingredients and Circumſtances muſt
be taken in a matter of Equity. Is it an argument to ſay,
He has no Eſtate? therefore take away his Wifes Eſtate,
then there will be nothing to maintain her.</p>
               <p>It is agréed, That if the Approbation had been precedent,
it had been well. Now ſhe had no notice before the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
that it was neceſſary, and when ſhe had that notice,
ſhe got the approbation, and that though ſubſequent, is good
enough, becauſe it was askt (and gotten) as ſoon as ſhe
had Notice, that ſhe ought to have it. The Will is hereby
ſufficiently obſerved, for the intent of the Will was, that
ſhe ſhould have ſuch an Husband as thoſe perſons ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
and this marriage is ſo approved. I rely upon this
matter, but eſpecially upon the word of <hi>Notice.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Serjeant Ellis.</hi> There was a Caſe of a <hi>Proviſo</hi> not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but with the conſent of certain perſons firſt had in writing.
Conſent was had, but not in writing, and yet you rul'd it
good. Had this been <hi>a Condition in Law</hi> (as 'tis <hi>in fact)</hi>
the Law would have helped her. If the Eſtate had been in
her, there might have been ſome reaſon that ſhe ſhould have
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> taken notice how it came to her (and of the Limitation,
&amp;c.) Had the Earl been alive and conſented to the Marriage,
after it was ſolemnized, he would have continued his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the Plaintiffs have had the Eſtate ſtill. Why now,
the conſent of the Lords and Counteſs, is as much as his
conſent: he had tranferred his conſent to them. This is
a <hi>Ratihabitio,</hi> you cannot have a Caſe of more Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Equity: 1. <hi>An Infant. 2. No notice. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
after. 4. Their Declaration that they thought my Lord
meant it in terrorem, &amp;c.</hi> What if two of the Truſteés
had died, ſhould ſhe never have married? ſurely you would
have relieved her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serjeant Baldwin.</hi> Here is as full a conſent to the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
as could well be in this Caſe. For ſince the Plaintiff
had no notice of the neceſſity of the Earls conſent before
the Marriage, it had been the ſtrangeſt and unexpectedeſt
thing in the world, that ſhe ſhould have gone about to have
askt it. The Heir ſhould not have taken notice of ſuch a
Forfeiture; and why ſhould a man that is named by way of
remainder? In caſe of a perſonal Legacy, this were a void
Proviſo by the Civil Law. For I have informed my ſelf of it.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:62849:160"/>
It is a Maxim with them, <hi>Matrimonium eſſe Liberum.</hi> This
amounts to as much as the Condition, that the perſon ſhould
not marry at all. For when 'tis in the Truſtées power they may
propoſe the unagreeableſt perſon in the World; 'tis a moſt
unreaſonable power, and not to be favoured. <hi>Sir Thomas Grimes</hi>
ſetled his Land ſo, that his Son ſhould pay portions; and if
he did not, he demiſed the Lands over, and it was adjudged
relieveable.</p>
               <p>If I limit that my Daughter ſhall marry with the conſent
of two, &amp;c. if each of them have a deſign for a different Friend,
if you will not relieve, ſhe can never marry.</p>
               <p>Is it not more probable, that if the Earl had lived he would
rather have given her a Maintenance, than have concluded her
under perpetual misfortune and diſheriſon?</p>

the ſame with this Caſe, the reaſon and equity is the ſame in
it ſelf. And if the Preſident be not the ſame Caſe with this,
it is not to be cited, being not to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bridgman Lord-Keeper.</hi> Certainly Preſidents are very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and uſeful to us, for in them we may find the reaſons
of the Equity to guide us, and beſide the authority of thoſe
who made them, is much to be regarded. We ſhall ſuppoſe
they did it upon great Conſideration, and weighing of the
matter, and it would be very ſtrange and very ill, if we
ſhould diſturb and ſet aſide what has been the courſe for a
long <hi>Series</hi> of time and ages.</p>
               <p>Thereupon it was Ordered, That they ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hale Chief Baron.</hi> The general queſtion is, whether this
Decrée ſhall paſs. I ſhall divide what I have to ſay into theſe
three queſtions or particulars. Firſt, I ſhall conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be a good <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Limitation,</hi> or <hi>conditional
Limitation.</hi> For ſo I had rather call it. It being a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to determine the Eſtate of the Plaintiff, and a Limitation
to let in the Defendant. I think it is good both in Law and
Equity, and my reaſons are; firſt, becauſe it is a collateral
Condition to the Land, and not againſt the nature of the
Eſtate, and ſhe is not thereby bound from Marriage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it obliged her to no more then her duty; ſhe had
no Mother; and in caſe of Marriage ſhe ought to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to her Grandmother, who was <hi>in loco Parentis;</hi> and
ſince the Eſtate moved from the Grandfather, ſhe was Miſtris
of the diſpoſition and manner of it. 'Tis true by the Civil
Eccleſiaſtical Law, regularly ſuch a Condition were void.
And therefore, if the queſtion were of a Legacy, there might
be a great deal of reaſon to queſtion the validity of it, becauſe
in thoſe Courts wherein Legacies are properly handled, it
would have been void. But this is a caſe of Land. <hi>(Deviſe)</hi>
Indeed it is agreed, that this is a good Condition, and not
to be avoided in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly. This being a good Condition and Limitation
over. The Queſtion is, whether there be relief againſt it in
Equity, admitting it were a wilful breach? I think there
ought not to be any. I differ from the reaſons preſſed at
the Bar; as firſt, That it was a deviſe by Will, by virtue
of the Statute, &amp;c. but that doth not ſtick with me. For if
there may not be a relief againſt a breach of a Condition in
a Will, there would be a great ſhatter and confuſion in mens
Eſtates, and ſome of thoſe ſettled by great advice, and there
have been Preſidents of relief in ſuch caſes, 2 <hi>Car. Fitz <hi>verſus</hi>
Seymour. And 10 <hi>Car. Salmon verſus</hi> Bernard.</hi> Secondly, It
has been urged, there ſhould be no relief, becauſe there is a
Limitation over. But that I ſhall not go upon neither.
There have been many reliefs in ſuch Caſes: I will decline
the latitude of the Objection, for that would go a great deal
further then we are aware. But yet I think there ought to
be no relief in this Caſe: It is not like the caſe of payment
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:62849:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of money, becauſe there the party may be anſwered his debt
with damages at another day; and ſo may be fully ſatisfied
of all that is intended him. But here my firſt reaſon is, That
it is a Condition to contain the party in that due Obedience,
which Law and nature require.</p>
               <p>(2) 'Tis a voluntary ſettlement to the Grandaughter in
tail, and the remainder over is ſo too; and both theſe parties
are in <hi>aequali gradu</hi> to the Deviſor; and therefore their being
both in a parity it would be hard to take the Eſtate from him,
to whom, and in whoſe Scale the Law hath thrown the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>(3) It appears by the body of the Will, that the Earl did
as really intend it ſhould go over, if ſhe married without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
as if ſhe died without Iſſue: for they are both in the ſame
clauſe. There may be as much reaſon to turn it into a Fee-ſimple,
in caſe as ſhe had died without Iſſue, as in this caſe.
For ſo I doubt the penning of this decretal Order does.</p>
               <p>And (4) I reſt upon this, It is a Caſe without a Preſident.
I remember after that <hi>Lanyett's Caſe</hi> had been adjudged that
6 <hi>Car.</hi> there was a Caſe, I ſuppoſe <hi>Saunders <hi>verſus</hi> Corniſh,</hi>
of a Limitation in Tail;<note place="margin">Cro 3 part, fo. 230 it was of a Leaſe for years, and ſo was adjudged void.</note> and then a deviſe over, and it was
adjudged void. And the Iudges ſaid, ſo far it is gone, and
we will go no further, becauſe we do not know where it will
reſt. I know there is no intrinſical difference in Caſes by
Preſidents. But there is a great difference in a Caſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a man is to make, and where a man ſees, (and is to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low)
a Preſident; in the one Caſe a man is more ſtrictly
bound up, but in the other he may take a greater liberty and
Latitude. For if a man be in doubt <hi>in aequilibrio</hi> concerning
a Caſe, whether it be equitable or no, in prudence he will
determine according as the Preſidents have been, eſpecially if
they have been made by men of good authority for Learning,
&amp;c. and have been continued and purſued. Here muſt be ſome
boundary, or we ſhall go we know not whither. It were hard
a Court of Equity ſhould do that that is not fit to be done in
any Court below a Parliament. The Preſidents do not come
home to the Caſe. Moſt of them are in caſe of money Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and in ſome of thoſe Caſes we may give allowance, in
reſpect of the Law of another <hi>forum,</hi> to which they belong.
But this is in caſe of Land only, <hi>vid' Swynborne 4. Co. 12.

of this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:62849:162"/>
(5) I ſhall conſider the allays and circumſtances which are
obſerved, and offered to qualifie this Caſe, and induce relief.
(1) 'Tis ſaid that this clauſe was only <hi>in terrorem,</hi> and ſome
Witneſſes have been examined to prove it. But I am not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
how collateral averments can be admitted in this caſe.
For then how can there be any certainty?<note place="margin">2 Cro 145.</note> 
                  <hi>A Will</hi> will be any
thing, every thing, nothing. The Statute appointed the
Will ſhould be in writing to make a certainty, and ſhall we
admit collateral averments and proofs, and make it utterly
uncertain?</p>
               <p>(2) 'Tis ſaid in this Caſe, the effect of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> has beén
obtained, for the Truſtees have now declared their conſent.</p>
               <p>I muſt ſay it is not full, for they do not ſay they would have
conſented; but that poſſibly ſuch reaſons might have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
as they ſhould have done it. And poſſibly I ſay not.
They, like good men, have only declined the ſhewing an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
contradicting of a thing which is done, and cannot now
be recalled, undone or altered. Beſides, if there had been
but a circumſtantial variation, the conſent afterwards might
have been ſomewhat. But here it is in the very ſubſtance.
In the Caſe before cited at the Bar by <hi>Mr. Serjeant Ellis,</hi>
where the conſent was to be had in writing, and it was had
only by <hi>Paroll,</hi> there was great Equity that it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
becauſe it was only a provident circumſtance, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Deviſor, <hi>viz.</hi> for the more firme obliging the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ask conſent, which the Deviſor conſidered might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be had by ſlight words, in ordinary and not ſolemn
Communication, or elſe in paſſion and heat, (as in this caſe
when the Plaintiff would not conſent to the approved Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the Lord <hi>Morpeth,</hi> the Counteſs ſaid ſhe might
marry where ſhe would. Which words imported a neglect of
care for the future over the Plaintiff, becauſe ſhe would not be
ruled by the Counteſs in accepting the tender of ſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
a Marriage;) as alſo for the benefit of the Deviſee (in
the Caſe aforeſaid) That in caſe the Deviſee did marry with
the conſent of the Truſtee, he might not after (through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
&amp;c.) avoid it by denial of ſuch conſent, and ſo defeat
or perplex the Deviſee for want of proof of ſuch his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>(3) 'Tis ſaid the party is an Infant. Why, an Infant is
bound by a Condition in Fact, by Law: 'tis true, we are
now in Equity; But in Equity, ſince this refers to an Act
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62849:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which ſhe, though an Infant, is capable of doing, <hi>viz.</hi>
to marry; it were unreaſonable that ſhe ſhould be able
to do the Act, and not be obliged by Equity to obſerve
the Conditions and Terms which concern and relate to
that Act. So that it is all one, as if ſhe had been of full
age. The Statute of <hi>Merton cap.</hi> 5. provides, that <hi>Uſury
ſhall not run againſt Infants,</hi> and yet the ſame Statute
<hi>cap.</hi> 6. appoints, That <hi>if an Infant marry without the
Licence of his Lord, &amp;c. he ſhall forfeit double the value
of his Marriage:</hi> and it is reaſonable, becauſe Marriage
is an Act which he may do by Law while he is under
age.</p>
               <p>(4) As to the point of <hi>Notice:</hi> (1) Whether <hi>Notice</hi>
be requiſite or no, in point of Law, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
But I muſt needs ſay, that it muſt be referred
to Law. But (2) If it be not requiſite in Law, how
far a Court of Equity might relieve for want of it, I
will not now take upon me to determine. I will not
trench upon matters <hi>Gratis,</hi> of which I know not what
will be the conſequence. But I conceive in this caſe, the
Fact is not yet ſettled, whether there were <hi>(notice)</hi> or
not; and it were a hard matter, That becauſe no <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi>
is here proved, it ſhould be taken for granted there
was none. For here are ſeveral circumſtances that ſeem
to ſhew there might be <hi>Notice:</hi> and a publick voice in
the Houſe, or an accidental Intimation, &amp;c. may poſſibly
be ſufficient <hi>Notice.</hi> I ſhall therefore leave it as a fit
thing to be tryed, and till that, the caſe in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is not ripe. And therefore I will add no more.
I think this Decree ought to be altered, if not ſet aſide.
But as this Caſe is, there ought to be no relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vaughan Chief Juſtice.</hi> I ſhall conclude as my Lord
<hi>Chief Baron</hi> did, That as this caſe is, there ought to
be no relief. I will ſingle out this caſe from ſeveral
things not material to it, as my Lord <hi>Chief Baron</hi> did,
&amp;c. I think, if Land be deviſed on Condition to pay
Legacies, and that the Deviſee has paid almoſt all, and
fails in one or ſo, there may be good cauſe of relief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he has paid much, and is ſomewhat in the nature
of a purchaſor. This is not like a Legacy, This is upon
the Statute. Where it is ſaid a man may Deviſe <hi>at
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:62849:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Will and pleaſure, i.e.</hi> abſolutely, upon Condition, upon
Limitation, or any way that the Law warrants. Suppoſe
there had been a ſpecial Act of Parliament diſpoſing as the
Earl has done, in this caſe could there be any colour in Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to alter or vary this Law? And here 'tis equally as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
as that, ſince the Statute gives a man power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
as expreſly, and otherwiſe Equity would alter and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of all property, and all things that came in queſtion.
But let <hi>Notice</hi> or <hi>Conſent, &amp;c.</hi> be requiſite, or not, 'tis Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
at Law. But I ſtand upon this, that there ought to be
no relief in Equity. It was inſiſted, that her Grandmother
gave a kind of conſent: but I take that for nothing; For
though the Grandmother would not have offered or propoſed a
Marriage, yet ſhe ought not to marry without her conſent.
Nor is the Lords <hi>Poſt-Conſent</hi> any thing, for conſent cannot
be had for things which cannot be otherwiſe, as a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid to conſent to his Stature, or the colour of his
hair, &amp;c. A man may know of what Opinion he is, or was;
but 'tis impoſſible for a man to know of what Opinion he would
have been in the circumſtances of Action, which he never try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I conclude, the Plaintiff ought not to have relief in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
But if any matter in Law will help them, they are
not excluded from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keling Cheif Juſtice.</hi> I think there ought to be no relief
in this Caſe; I have conſidered it as well as I can, and I think
nothing is more fit to be obſerved then thief Cuſtomary Rules
for Children, they are very good reſtraints for Children, and
ought to be made good here, to encourage obedience and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
thoſe who would make a Prey of them; and if there
were not hope for men, to haſten their fortunes by this means,
there would be few adventures of this nature; I have lookt
upon the <hi>Preſidents,</hi> &amp;c. and I find they come not to this
Caſe, except only one and that is but ſeven years old, and the
other are for money, for which there is reaſon, becauſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be ſubſtantially relieved and ſatisfied otherways. If
there had been no limitation over there may be ſome reaſon
why it may be intented, that it was only <hi>in terrorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not think all Caſes upon <hi>Wills</hi> are irremediable here
(becauſe of the Statute.) If the breach of the Condition
be in a circumſtance only, as in the Caſe, where the conſent
was given, but not in writing, as it ought, it may be relieved,
for that was a caution to the Conſentor, that he ſhould not
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62849:163"/>
give conſent before ſtrangers, and truſt to the ſwearing of a
<hi>parol-conſent.</hi> I never yet ſaw any deviſe obliging to have any
ſuch conſent after the parties age of 21 years, ſo that there is
no great hardſhip in it. And if there ſhould be any ill deſign in
thoſe who have the truſt and power to conſent in with-holding
their conſent, it might be relieved here. I think none would
make a decree, that if ſhe died without iſſue, the Defendant
ſhould have it, and this is the ſame: But equity can never
go againſt the ſubſtantial part of a Conveyance or Will, but
that muſt be governed by the parties agreement or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Equity ought to ariſe upon ſome collateral or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
emergent. 'Tis not <hi>in Terrorem</hi> indeed without a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
There can be no collateral Averment. Being an Infant is
nothing: for this is only a proviſion while ſhe is an Infant.
Beſides, the caſe of the Forfeiture of the double value is a
very good inſtance for the <hi>Notice.</hi> If ſhe had notice of this
Will, yet they that came to ſteal her knew it not: for they did
not come to take a ſhorn ſheep, and therefore no relief is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the Plaintiff. In Honeſty and Conſcience thoſe
Bonds ought to be kept ſtrict. I confeſs, I would not have
the Plaintiff tempted to a further Suit, but indeed in ſaying
that I go further then I need.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bridgeman Lord Keeper.</hi> If I were of another Opinion,
yet I would be bound by my Lords; for I did not ſend for
them, not to be bound by them. But I was of their Opinion
from the beginning. And I am glad now that we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from a common Error, and that men may make ſuch
proviſions as may bind their Children. But to juſtifie the
Decree a little: (1) Here is 5000 <hi>l.</hi> appointed to <hi>George
Porter,</hi> (ſo that the ample proviſion was made for him, and it
may the rather be intended that this Eſtate was wholly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Plaintiff.) (2) Here was a Poſt-conſent, and thoſe
perſons were <hi>in loco parentum.</hi> Now if the Earl had, as
poſſibly he might have, thus pardoned and been reconciled to
the Marriage, he would probably have given the Plaintiff the
Eſtate, and that is a reaſon to induce us to the ſame. For
I think it clear, that an Eſtate by Act of Parliament is liable
to the ſame Relief, Regulation, &amp;c. as any other Eſtate.
An Eſtate Tail, though that be by Statute, yet is liable to be
cut off, &amp;c. If there had beén a time limited, then there had
been more reaſon to bind her up to have conſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:62849:164"/>
But there ought to be a reſtraint put in theſe Caſes: That
of the double forfeiture was truly and well obſerved: Where
no body is bound to give <hi>Notice,</hi> it is to be taken; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
ſhe is not heir, for that might have made a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
This I thought not to ſay. Vpon the whole I am
of my Opinion with my Lords, and I am glad I have their
aſſiſtance.</p>
