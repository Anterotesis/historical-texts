            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME General Considerations OFFERED, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere is nothing that Mankind, in our latter times especially, has more bent his Thoughts about, and been more Conversant in, than the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Trade, being fully sensible that its improvement, tends not only to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Personal but National Interests; and hence it is, that our Industrious Ancestors, while it was in its Infancy, exercised all possible care in nursing it up, and defending it from those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs wherewith it might be beset, The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of this Kingdom, are Land, Trade, and Manufactures, and are such supports, which by no means ought to be shaken; they have for a considerable time born the brunt of the War, and it is time now they should have a breathing, and slide their Necks out of the Collar: The Trade of this Kingdom hath all-along been an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35349:3"/>
Ornament to it, and would be still so, if the occasion of its pinings were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, and fit ways apply'd for its recovery. I would not pretend to Dictate, but with all Submission Crave, that we should but have an eye to the Vitals of Trade, which seems to be deeply affected. For what thing soever is a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to our Manufacture, or Weight upon our foreign Trade beyond what it can bear up under, stabs it to the Heart: hereby the Subject is disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: but when our Manufactures are incouraged, and our foreign Trade made easie, and firmly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, our Lands then will be advanced. And it is indeed very evident that the promoting of our Manufactures is not only beneficial to particular persons, but also to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in general, wherein many thousands of poor indigent Families are imployed, and as the said Manufactures are either advanced, or diminished, so the Value of our Lands must increase or decrease in propotion; for notwithstanding that the product of our Lands hath born a very considerable price, for seven or eight years last past, occasioned by the badness of our Coin, the Clothing our Armys at Home and abroad, and the devastations made in several of our Neighbouring Countries by the late Wars, as well as the taking of great Numbers of our outward-bound Ships, which oblig'd the Merchants to buy double the quantities thereof, than otherwise they would have done: the Peace having put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod unto all those things, our product must come down to its ancient Price, and in all probability
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35349:3"/>
much lower; for, within these Eight or Ten Years we have had several Wounds and Breaches made in our Trade by our Neighbours, they having the same opportunity to advance their Trade and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, that <hi>England</hi> had for several Years, at least before the War, I mean the <hi>French, Portuguise, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noese, Swedes,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> not to say any thing of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who, by their Industry and good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, never fail to advance their Interest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they get footing; for what advantage in Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick soever any Kingdom gains, is generally so much lost by another.</p>
            <p>During the late War, those Nations above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned have not only been the Carriers of their own Manufactures, but also of their Neighbours in siing their own Shipping, by which they are not only become very Rich in general, but even in this, that they have furnished themselves with as many Ships and Men, as are sufficient to manage their own Trade, which within these dozen Years was the great part of it ours, and managed by us; for <hi>England</hi> having been many Years at Peace, whilst most of our Neighbours were oppressed by War, and by consequence rendred in a great degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Navigation. We pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ess'd most of the Trade of <hi>Europe,</hi> having then no Partners but the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and they too, but Fourths or Fifths, which by good Husbandry they have so much improv'd, that they are now more than joynt Partners.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, That though those Nations have, during the last War, gained the ascendant over us in several parts of our Trade, yet now
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35349:4"/>
that we enjoy Peace, we may probably recover it again. To this I answer, That we have little reason to hope to out-Trade the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now stand, more than the rest of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who Build, Victual, and Sail cheaper than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> having most or all of their Materials or Merchandizes within themselves, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of Workmen and others much cheaper than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have little or nothing of their own, but obtain all by Navigation, paying but very small duties for Exportes and Importes, which is the great incouragement of Merchants, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is the Pane of Trade, to the woefull Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many Nations, our own not excepted. And tho' this may seem a digression from the Matter in hand, yet may it serve as an Auxiliary, to excite our diligence, not only in propagating Navigation, but also the Staple Commodities of this Nation, <hi>viz,</hi> the Woollen Manufactury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, if neglected, will in a few Years pine; for we having Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors in our Foreign Trade, and so may have the like in our Manufactures, there being in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> diverse considerable Settlements, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have been furnished with most of their Cloathing and Utensils from <hi>England,</hi> but their Countries not furnishing them with sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Vendible Commodities for <hi>England,</hi> by this means their Cloathing proving excessive dear and chargeable, hath put them upon breeding all sorts of Cattle, and making their own Cloathing, which is certainly very detrimental to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35349:4"/>The like may be said of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whose Cattel and Provisions being low and likely to be lower, occasions their taking such Methods as may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Woollen Manufactures there, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided of all suitable Materials for such an Undertaking, which being Transported, they will as much outvy us in Woollen Commodities as they do in their Provisions; and if it should be in any degree or particular hindred, or prohibited, it would not only lessen the value of the <hi>English</hi> Settlements, but mightily weaken the Protestant Interest, or at least make things uneasie, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foreigners from going and setling there: for all Persons that transport themselves into Foreign Regions, do it in expectation of an advantageous and secure Settlement, which is the principal Motive to run Adventures, and to visit unknown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; so that it may be better to lay a Duty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> upon every pound weight of Woollen Manufactury exported from <hi>Ireland</hi>: It will make theirs equivalent with our Woollen Manufactures, so both Nations may go on joyntly in the preservation thereof, and prevent the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Wooll from either Kingdom into Foreign Parts: For all Trade and Industry ought to be free, so as not to be fettered with heavy Impositions; for where they are so, all Commerce will fail, the Common People and Tradesmen growing poor, and thereby the intrinsick value both of Lands and all its productions are lessened, insomuch that many of the best Subjects, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the labouring people, will be in a manner forced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35349:5"/>
to seek their Fortunes in other Countries, as meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with nothing but discouragement at home: therefore it will be highly necessary not only to promote the Exportation of the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factury, but also the Consumption at home: a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of the Benefit thereof is very evident in the late Act made in King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Reign, for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in Woollen, which Act cannot do less then occasion the yearly Consumption of three Million of yards of Woollen for Funerals in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>But there are several projects of late that have obtained Reputation, to the prejudice of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Manufacture, one whereof is the furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Funerals, by a small number of Men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Undertakers, who always keep by them all necessaries and proper materialls to Fit and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate Funerals, <hi>viz.</hi> Cloaks, Hangings, Coach-coverings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that such Persons who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were at great expences in mourning for their Relations and Friends, may now, for a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, have all things fitted for that purpose: and though, it's true, when Gentlemen bought those things themselves, they made a less show, yet it did bring more advantage to the Nation, such things being generally spent within the compass of one Year: but by this invention one Cloak and other necessaries do serve several Years, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish some hundred Funerals, working Journey-work as long as one thread will hang to another. And this is not only an Enemy to the Consumption of the Woollen Manufacture, but very injurious to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35349:5"/>
many Tradesmen, as Weavers, Drapers, Taylors, Glovers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For these Gentlemen the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are good Husbands, pinchingly buying all things in gross and at first hand, and Tradesmen employed, under them have very low rates, no better then Taylors have of Salesmen; for it must needs be detrimental to our Nation to diminish its number of Labourers and lower the Prices.</p>
            <p>Moreover, since the Method of these Undertakers have got footing, Persons of ordinary Rank, may for the value of Fifty pounds make as great a Figure, as the Nobility and Gentry did formerly with the expence of more than Five Hundred Pounds. The Undertakers are great gainers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one Suit of Mourning Furniture will serve above an hundred times; so that hence there not only happens a less Consumption, but the Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Splendor both of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is hereby very much eclipsed, so that not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them do in this exceed the show of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, except some few of the Nobility, who lie a considerable time in State, so that it is very clear that twenty or thirty of those sort of Men do greatly hinder the Consumption of our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Manufacture, and consequently destroy the livelyhoods of many thousand Families.</p>
            <p>For Nations are generally poor where the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer's Wages are small, and the Consumption but little, it having been for many Years past, the great Wages and free Circulation of Trade amongst the common people as well as others, that hath made <hi>England</hi> exceed all her Neighbouring Nations in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35349:6"/>
Riches and in the Consumption not only of our own Growth and Manufactures, but likewise of many Foreign Commodities, such as <hi>Wines, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Fruits, Sugars, Silks, Spices, Tobacco,</hi> &amp;c. of which perhaps this small Island hath consumed more than <hi>Poland, Swedeland, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and thereby have brought very great Revenues to the Crown: if this were not so, why should not <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> be as beneficial to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as <hi>England,</hi> for nothing more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Lands and all its productions, then Traders large gains, which promoteth free Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Genteel living, whatever contrary mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notions may have got footing.</p>
            <p>It is also further to be consider'd, That there are two or three other Inventions prejudicial to the publick, <hi>viz.</hi> making Buttons and Buckles of various sorts of Mettal, with which things, a few hands can supply many Nations, three or four Boys and Girls being able to make two thousand four hundred dozen in a Week of Pewter Buttons, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dozen whereof will last a very long time, far longer then either Thread, Silk, or Hair, and which are valued at first hand but from twelve to eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pence <hi>per</hi> Gross, great and small together, which indeed may be of some advantage for Exportation, but hinders the Consumption of our own Manufactures at home. The like may be understood of Shoe-Buckles, of which a small number of Poeple can supply a whole Nation, for you may buy a pair of Shoe Buckles, from a penny to two-pence (unless Silver) that will last

from one year to seven, and some others of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter value that may wear twenty Years, not only to the detriment of our Manufactures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but more particularly to the Narrow Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; for it is supposed, that less then one hundred of Buckle-Makers will supply more people, than fifty or sixty thousand narrow Weavers, in Tape, Cotten, Ferret, and Silk Ribband, which Trade of late have been forc'd to seek their Fortunes in other Countries, to the damage and dishonour of the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>The like may be consider'd of the invention of Paper Hangings, which are but of small value, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long, and employ but a few people: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless they will last almost as long as our common Woollen Hangings, provided the Walls are lined with Slit-Deal, or Mat, Chair high; which does likewise lessen the number of our People, and the Consumption of our Woollen Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p>Moreover, though Navigation be one of the greatest Pillars of Trade, and brings the greatest advantage to the Nation, nevertheless the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of our own Manufactures and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of many hands are considerable additional advantages; for, suppose ten Shoe-makers could make as many Shoes in a Week as a hundred do now, and those too wear five times as long, what then must become of the rest of the Workmen? must they not seek their Fortunes in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries? the like may be said of all other Trades: does not the strength of this Nation consist in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35349:7"/>
Artificers, and Tradesmen, they being most Tractable and Ingenious, both in Peace and War. It is the working People and Tradesmen that pays the King his Tax for Ale and Beer, and not so much the Countrymen nor Shepherd; no, it is the former that more abundantly consumes the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Spices, Spanish Fruits, Tobacco, and Wines too, and do thereby advance the Consumption of our own Provisions and Fruits, many of which would be of little value, if it were not for the forementioned Commodities, mixed with Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Gooseberrys, Currants, and none of which would be made Food, and so be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to us, if they were not mixed with such Sweets, which do likewise occasion the Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Flower: and it is most clear that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of their Commodities, have of late Years mightily encouraged Importation and Exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so that if our expences at home be lessened for want of a free Circulation of Trade amongst the people, our Plantation Trade will suffer as well as others; for the <hi>French, Dutch, Portuguise,</hi> &amp;c. who have all of them Plantations in the <hi>West-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and as theirs do rise, ours consequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, and will continue declining unless they have some special Encouragement and Assistance, and that because the <hi>French</hi> King does as much bend his inclinations and strength to the advancement of Trade and Navigation, especially his Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, greatly incouraging them by laying on small Duties on their several productions, as Sugar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and lending his Care also to all such Projections
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35349:7"/>
and Proposals that his Subjects do offer for the advancement of Trade, and the Manufactures of his Kingdom; and if they have a fair prospect of advantage, he is then willing to bear some of the Losses and Charges that may happen to the same Project, for the first two or three Years; he does likewise mightily endeavour to advance the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Trade of the Fishery and sundry Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, which are advanced since the Peace about twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> which is a great Encouragement to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portuguise</hi> likewise, of late being advanced in Trade and Navigation, and having one of the best and largest Settlements for Sugar, <hi>viz. Brasil, &amp;c.</hi> will be thereby encouraged to make greater Quantities of that Commodity than formerly, which together with the forementioned <hi>French</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will supply most of the Markets of <hi>Europe,</hi> which hitherto the <hi>English</hi> have done.</p>
            <p>Whereas, on the other hand, our own Sugar Plantations must decline, especially that of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi> the Land being weakened and almost worn out by often Planting, which perhaps in its youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full days was the most Fertil'st Spot of all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> and twenty or thirty years ago was so strong and fertile, that from once Planting their Sugar, Canes would from the same root bear conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable crops seven years together before they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to new Plant and Dung them every Year, and have treble the Labour and Hands to keep them from Weeds; so that formerly one hundred <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> and one Sugar Wind-mill would clear the Planter more Money then three hundred <hi>Negroes</hi> and two or three Wind-mills will do now: so that every hundred weight of Sugar stands the maker thereof in more than double what it did then, and yet does not yield him half the Price.</p>
            <p>The West-<hi>India</hi> Settlements, for these Thirty or Fourty Years last past, have been the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Gem in our Crown of Trade, by employing great numbers of Ships, and making the best of Seamen; for within these twenty Years the Island of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> alone did load yearly near four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sail of Ships, so that no Trade hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Navigation like those Settlements: but now the charge of making Sugar is so great, and the price so low, that this, together with the high Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties lately laid on their Commodities, will force them to make but a third or half the Quantity of Sugar, and oblige them to apply themselves to raise Provisions to support their Families with their own Product<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which have hitherto been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the Settlements upon the Main; for within these twenty Years we did lade from <hi>England</hi> more than one hundred and fifty Sail of Ships, with Bread, Butter, Cheese, Beer, Flesh, and other Eatables, besides all sorts of Merchandizes, and now we do not load three: therefore it will needs be for the interest of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:35349:8"/>
to lighten their Burden, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the great Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms under which it is impossible for the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to stand, for that which formerly raised and advanced the Planters, was the making of much Sugar, but that does now ruin and undo them, the Charge being much more than the Interest; to which if there be not proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies applied, it will cut off one of the Noblest Branches of Navigation.</p>
            <p>Consider in the next place, as to our Trade with <hi>France,</hi> many are of various Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, the differing Notions whereof I will not here undertake to reconcile; but upon the whole we have good reason to affirm that it has always proved very profitable to this Nation, as all other Trades, wherein great numbers of our own Ships are imployed as Carriers, which was the original advancement of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>Some will perhaps object and say, that the <hi>French</hi> Trade is of no great Importance to <hi>England,</hi> because of their exhausting from us great sums of Money.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that our Navigation may be lessened, and they may from necessity, which is the Mother of Invention, be further setting up of Manufactures to the lessening of ours: besides, they have taken considerably of our Product, which we shall be deprived of by not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35349:9"/>
trading with them; for it is observed that great Numbers of Artificers have shifted their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and transported themselves to seek their Fortunes in unknown Countries, and many of them leaving their miserable Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the Parish, and most of them have done so for want of such encouragement as they had formerly, and this has been partly occasioned, not so much from great numbers of Strangers that of late years have pressed in upon us, whose Education and miserable low way of living in comparision of ours, which have rendered them capable to Live and Work at lower rates than the <hi>English,</hi> most of them being Lodgers, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and sheltered under a few Housekeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a House that contains four, six or eight Rooms does for the most part entertain near as many Families, as is usual in their own Countries, which does likewise hide and defend them from paying Taxes either to the Parish or Government: I say not so much on this account, as from great declension of their several imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>In the next place, our Trade is likewise preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, by another sort of Strangers of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, most of which are single Men, as Factors, Gentlemen, and others, that are also Lodgers and Inmates, many of them live here from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Twenty Years, imploying some of our Eminent Tradesmen, as Packers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are paid but little better than Journeymen to Buy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35349:9"/>
and Collect their Merchandises in Gross, and at first hand, whereby they obstruct and hinder the lively-hoods of many of our Tradesmen, whose hands they would otherwise have passed through before they came to the Exporter, as in former-times was usual: And when these Factors have by their frugal living and Monopolizing methods obtained great Estates, they then remit them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own Countries, and bid farewell to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wherein they have so much advanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and have lived so free and easie from all Duties and Impositions, being not only excused from any Office or Charge of the Parish, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the King and Government, when at the same time our own poor Tradesmen that are House-keepers, and who have but a mean way of geting a Livelyhood, are overwhelmed and oppressed with Taxes and Offices, when these Strangers get the Money and bear none of the Burthens, there being many thousands of those people, for which there is no President in any other Nation: for these incroachments are like Sheep fed upon the <hi>Cottshold-hills,</hi> and black Cattle on the <hi>Welch Mountains,</hi> which when they come into the Valleys or better Pastures, will Improve and grow Fat, whereas such as are bred upon the same spot or Pasturage, can hardly live: These are some of those Moths that spoil us in our Trade. Another Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is that we have lost very much of our Navigation, which appears from the unheard of losses Merchants have met with during the late
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35349:10"/>
War, there having been many brave Estates sunk, and others rendred weak and feeble.</p>
            <p>The inland Traders have this advantage of the former, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to spend what they have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got, for want of a free and generous circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Trade, which occasions many eminent Tradesmen of all sorts, and such as were good House-keepers to shift and hide themselves in Lodgings, and to follow the fashions of our neighbouring Nations, which does and will prove very prejudicial, not only to the Imployments of many People, but to all such as have their Estates in Houses, there being many hundreds in and about <hi>London,</hi> that do not pay the King's Tax; and other Casualties that happen, which do not only mightily lessen the Consumption of our own Growth, but more especially that of all Foreign Commodities, and such as come from our own Plantations also, as Sugar, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewise Wine, Spice, <hi>Spanish</hi> fruit, and a hundred other things, for of late and at this time those Commodities are very low in Price, notwithstanding the Merchants have not above a third or fourth of the quantities at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket as there used to be in peaceable times, but especially of some sorts of them, the principal occasion of this lowness and dead trading is, we do not consume half the quantities we did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, neither do we Export so much, for our neighbouring Nations do and will furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from their own Settlements or Plantations
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35349:10"/>
and other parts which is another considerable wound to Navigation.</p>
            <p>Now, tho' some of the forementioned Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Commodities are consum'd by some, makes some of the unthinking sort to suppose, that there is as much spent as ever, yet the Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in those Commodities will inform us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and to their great loss; for the grand Consumption of those things, do chiefly depend on the middle or common people, <hi>viz.</hi> the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who are numerous, and as the Proverb has it, <hi>Many hands make light work,</hi> for every Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is under a kind of necessity to spend in proportion to his Trade and Gain: as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in several out parts of <hi>London,</hi> there were within the compass of two or three small Streets, Lanes, and Allies, two or three thousand working Tradesmen, and such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, some of which Trades did get about twelve hundred pound <hi>per</hi> Week, when they had full Employment, and most of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey was spent every Week in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in strong-Drink, several sorts of Flesh, Bread, Butter, Cheese, Sugar, Spice, Spanish Fruit, and in Cloathing, which caused a quick Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in all Business.</p>
            <p>But now the Numbers of Labourers is not only lessened, but those that are, do work for less Wages, and have not work enough neither, which does likewise occasion the Rents of all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35349:11"/>
Houses, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> to fall, and in a little time those things will have an influence upon Land; for Tradesmen did not use to matter whether they gave from Twenty to Fifty or Sixty pound for a House, provided that their Trade was good, but are not able to give such Rents now.</p>
            <p>The like is to be understood in all Expences and Taxes to the King, therefore the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Navigation and a free Trade, gives life to the Trading People, more especially if the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Imports be made easie, for great Weights and Burthens laid on any particular Member, will not only discourage it, but must cause it to sink and perish; besides, Merchants are, as is said before, the Engines of the whole Nation, and if encouraged, have an innate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to set all hands at work, and to advance all the Manufactures and Productions of the Nation, and render the whole capable not only to live well, and spend Money liberally, but to pay Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as freely.</p>
            <p>Now great Taxes cannot, as is mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be born by any particular part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without endangering their ruin, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Importers and Exporters, because they are the High-ways and principal Gates that all Commerce must pass through, which, if in any degree be stop'd or obstructed, the whole must suffer in proportion; besides, such Taxes and Impositions as are laid unequally on the people
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35349:11"/>
have hardly ever answered hitherto, neither is it reasonable to think, that they will for the future.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it seems to be a general opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a small gentle Tax laid on the Mouth and Back, would answer and supply the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons present occasions, and raise such sums as their necessities call's for, without any manifest Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or Injury to them, for the Belly will not be cheated, besides, then there would be many Millions of people more to pay that which now lies on less than one Million, by this, you bring in considerable numbers of Strangers, Young People, and Lodgers, such as we before treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, who have hitherto shifted their necks out of the Collar, many of them being Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and better able to pay Taxes, than some Housekeepers, both of our own Nation and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: This way would hurt neither rich nor poor, provided that Navigation and a free Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Trade be maintained, and Merchants in couraged; for the sums of Money that are now wanted, and that must be raised to make good the deficiency of former Funds, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent supply of the King, will be much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be advanced than ever, for as Trading sinks, so in proportion all things fall into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive State, and therefore Taxes will rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer, because the Commodities they are laid on, are not spent and consumed as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, great part of the people being forced by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35349:12"/>
pure necessity to retrench their expences in all Luxurious Commodities, of which no more then is consumed in <hi>England,</hi> are of value to the King, for those that are Exported, pays next to nothing, most of the Customs being drawn back.</p>
            <p>So that it is clear and manifest beyond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, the want of Trading makes the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity of the people grow poor, of which our Experience hath made us too sensible already, so that not only the Consumption of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Commodities, but likewise of our Manufactures too, will be lessened.</p>
            <p>It may be some will object, That the <hi>English</hi> Nation have never been used to have their Food and Cloathing Taxed, so that it will be a hard Morsel to swallow: I answer hereunto that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, we never had occasion for such great sums of Money, and therefore, as the sums are great and strange, the Methods of raising them, must be as universal, and it will be well if the Nation can do it either by this or any other equal way or Method.</p>
            <p>Now it is further to be noted that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cause and reason, why we have suffered such great Shipwracks of late in our Trade hath been from the War, so that our neutral Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have had opportunity to increase their number of Ships and Seamen, which by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35349:12"/>
gain, have wounded us to the very heart, in the next place our Merchants and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, are of as various Opinions and Notions in Trade, both those that Trade abroad and such as Trade at home, and for the most part so many Trades as there are, so many Notions and Opinions they are of, in those Trades they have been bred up, so that if Traders do not know nor essentially understand and have not true universal Principles and Notions, but disagree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves.</p>
            <p>But it is not to be doubted, that if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters and all inland Traders, and dependers or Craftsmen, did agree in true universal Notions and Methods of Trade, then our Country Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen must be convinced and made sensible, that it would be their principal interests to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and advance Trade, which hitherto hath made this Nation richer than any of our Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Countrys, and hath more than trebled in value every Acre of Land in <hi>England,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compass of one hundred years, for about that time Trading and Merchandize did take its birth, we having very little before, for in King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.'s Reign the Customs were not much more then Ten thousand pound <hi>Per Annum,</hi> by which any person may easily Judge of Trade then and now, and all Land Manufactures, bore then a proportionable low value; but it is to be noted, that our great and as it were unheard-of Trade, hath advanced within the compass of Fifty years,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35349:13"/>
when it came on with a rapid motion, which was chiefly occasioned by the Wars and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall devestations, our Neighbouring Nations made one upon another, and if any of them had Peace Seven or Ten years, then new Wars were waged again, so that by their Misery and Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>England</hi> had the opportunity to invest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the whole Trade of <hi>Europe,</hi> and about the same time the <hi>West-Indies</hi> was settled to the very great profit and advancement of Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath now seen its best days and if the present Impositions lately laid on their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, be not eased, many brave Plantations must of necessity sink and come to nothing, or at least yield no profit nor advantage to <hi>England,</hi> and will as it were cut of one of the principalest Branches of Navigation, as has been already said: for it is the great quantities of Bulksom Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, that multiplies Ships and Men, and that pays the King most Customs, <hi>viz.</hi> Sugar, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, Cotton, Ginger, Wine, and the like, which Commodities can never be in any Quantity Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported nor consumed, but only in such Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as have a free brisk Trade and easie Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Importer, and where the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty and working people have great Wages, which renders them able to Drink and Eat them; for that is the Mouth or Carrier that vends the most part of such things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:35349:13"/>For this cause the Tradesmen and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of <hi>England</hi> have spent and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med greater quantities of such things than half <hi>Europe</hi>; the Tradesmen and poor of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hardly knowing their names, and much less their natures.</p>
            <p>Now many do alledge, that it is the Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of several Commodities that we bring for Returns from Foreign parts, that affords the most benefit to this Nation, which I agree to, yet nevertheless there are many eminent Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are Imported and pays the King considerable Duties which must be spent in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, viz.</hi> Spanish Fruit, as Raisins of several sorts, Figs, Pruens, Currants, Dates, Almonds, Rice, Spice, Silks, Wines of all sorts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Consumption whereof, since the dead Trading and high Taxes, have been contracted into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Circle, and must be yet more if Merchants, Traders, and Tradesmen, do not meet with more incouragement than they have lately, or than they have a present prospect of; so that it is most clear that the Consumption of such things at home is as profitable to the Nation, as those that are Exported again: for if we can neither consume them at home nor Export them abroad, how should our Neighbours be able to pay for our Manufactures, for which we have those Commodities in Exchange; Some perhaps will object, and say we may have money, which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35349:14"/>
cannot be: but suppose such a thing could be effected, what then would become of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, for a few Ships would carry our own Manufactures and bring in Money, and what support would this be to the Government, for then all the Customs would not pay the King's Officers their Salleries, more especially since our Markets are not so incouraging as formerly; and hence it is that the Revenues of the Crown do decrease, occasioned by the generall retrenching of expences.</p>
            <p>I shall further add, That the additional du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and high imposts laid on Merchandizes, do either discourage the Trader, or oceasion less quantities to be Imported, making such things dear to the Subject, and thereby the Consumption is abated, because the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach to buy them, which as has been said already, will ruin our Plantations in the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like is to be understood of great exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on several Commodities at home, which does so advance them, that thereby the common people consumes but a third or half the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they did when they were cheap: besides high duties on some Commodities, do as it were put a full stop to them, so that they pay the King little or no duty nor Custom, for if the imposts be greater than the interest, it does as it were at once cut off all publick commerse and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35349:14"/>
puts people on contriving indirect Methods and Ways how they may run such things, by which means the King is deprived of his Customs and the universal use of the thing is lost, and what is spent is made dear, so that people cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and there is no Man of sence but must acknowledge, that it is the Circulation of Trade amongst the inferiour Artificers and Tradesmen, on whom the chief and principal Consumption of our own Manufactures, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Imported Commodities, such as Sugar, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Spanish Fruit, all sorts of Wines, and the like, depends, and it is clear that if our Trade both at home and abroad, had been in such a Consumptive state Twenty or Thirty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go as it is now, then this City would never have been built, nor so many Noble Houses and Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures Erected, as there has been in and about <hi>London,</hi> which are as so many Monuments of our former Riches and great Trade.</p>
            <p>It hath been also observed, that in <hi>England,</hi> after Wars and Devastations, we used to have a considerable increase of Trade, and this being within the memory of most Traders, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the late Peace did expect to see the same, but they now find altogether the contrary, and instead of an increase, most Trades have been much worse than before, and as to our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, what was taken before and destroyed by our Enemies in the War, hath been as it were cast away on Shore, by the small vend and low
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35349:15"/>
prices. So Melancholly at present are the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Traders and Merchants of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>Therefore it would be highly necessary that there should be a Committe composed of two or three of the most prudent of each Trade who have, during the late War, been Traders, and continue to be at this time, and whose E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states and Stocks are now imploy'd that way, for such are most sensible of the late Wounds our Trade has received, and can best advise Methods how they may be healed again; so that it were better such a Committee do not consist of those whose Education and manner of Life hath tended another way; nor yet of old Merchants, who for a considerable time have withdrawn their Stocks from Trade: for, tho' these may be Men of sufficient Parts and Integrity, yet now, all the Circumstances of Trading seem to be new; and therefore the Management and Methods that were formerly proper, before we had so many Rivals, cannot be suppos'd to be serviceable at present.</p>
