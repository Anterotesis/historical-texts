            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TEXT.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Canticles 2. Chap. 14. 15, 16, 17.</bibl>
               <q>Verses. O my Dove that
art in the Clefts of the Rock, in the Secret Places of
the Stairs, let me see thy Countenance, let me hear thy
Voice; for Sweet is thy Voice, and thy Countenance is
Comely, &amp;c.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the 14. Verse, there is (1:) A Stile given to the Kirk.
(2.) A Suit made. (3.) A Doubt answered. In the
15. Verse, A New Doubt answered, and a Suit made;
He calls her <hi>His Dove,</hi> He rewes nothing that He said, He
bides by His Word, He calls her <hi>His Love, His Fair One,
His Vndefiled,</hi> Now He avoues it, He bides by it; You
are even <hi>My Dove:</hi> Yet He is not Flattering her. If ye be
CHRISTs, He will give you all your Stiles of Honour; He
will speak much Good of you, both behind your Back, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Face: She is termed <hi>CHRISTs Dove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because the Dove is a fearfull Bird and soon scarred,
Hosea 11. 11. <hi>They shall tremble like a Dove out of Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
Any thing, the smallest Noise or Dinn that can be,
frights and chases these Timorous Birds in their Dove-house
into CHRIST. It is an happie Rain that chases CHRIST's
Doves in to himself; For all the Devils Wit he is soon beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Storm that arises against the Ship where CHRIST
and his Disciples are, makes them to Awaken and Pray.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40089:3"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Dove is a Mournfull Bird; So are the <hi>Doves</hi>
of CHRIST Mourning, and in Tears, Zek. 16. <hi>They that
Escape of them shall be like Doves of the Mountains; Like
Doves in the Valleys, all of them Mourning: Every one
of them for their Iniquities.</hi> If ye be GODs <hi>Doves,</hi> ye
will have manie a Sorrowfull Day in the World: There is
Bloodie Weirs betwixt the Kirk and the World; Keep the
Dove from the Nest, and she Mourns without; Keep the Kirk
from <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and she will break her Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> She is not a Revengefull Bird, she has no other
Armour against the Ravens and Vultures, but her Wings to
flee away. GODs Childrens best Armour when they are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is, by Faith in Prayer to mount up to GOD; They must
be like <hi>CHRIST.</hi> He went out of the World with manie a
Wrong, and they are not yet Revenged, his Blood is keeping
to the Last Court Day. <hi>CHRIST</hi> sits with manie a Wrong in
Heaven; He has not gotten amends of these that Spate in his
Face. Manie a time the Kirk and her Husband <hi>CHRIST</hi> will
be here wronged, albeit it be seen betwixt them. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. She
shuts him to the Door, and lets him Lodge all Night in the
Rainie Fields.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Kirk is like a <hi>Dove</hi> Mourning
without a Marrow; for that Fowl cannot want a Marrow: If
ye be GOD's <hi>Doves,</hi> Woe will ye be when your Marrow
<hi>CHRIST</hi> flies away. She falls aswoon and her heart flies out
of her when <hi>CHRIST</hi> flies away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Dove</hi> is an Innocent Harmless Bird. she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
offend. So is the Kirk; the Meek Spouse of <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
will not Marrow with a Malicious House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Dove</hi> is a Silly, Weak, Tender Fowl, and
if they be compared to the rest of the Birds, they are but
counted the tenth of flying Fowls; Surelie GODs Kirk in her
Self is but a Weak Bird and Tender Woman, compared in <hi>Rev.</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40089:3"/>
12. to a Woman with Child lately Delivered, and little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
her Death and her Life, if she be not Carefullie attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
A Christian is a Tender Thing; an Jewel in the Hand
of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> If He let us fall we are soon broken in pieces:
We should pray that <hi>CHRIST</hi> may handle us softlie, and not
let us be Tempted above our Strength. The Kirk is called,
<hi>Micah</hi> 4. and 6. a Cripple Woman that goes onlie upon her
one Side. So surelie we had need <hi>to come out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Leaning on our Beloved,</hi> Cant. 8. Chap.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> And for their Number they are but an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<hi>Isaiah</hi> 1. The Tein or Remnant GODs Part is but the
Tenth, and the Devil has all the Stock; often GOD has one
and the Devil nine; Great need have we to labour to be of
GODs tenth. <hi>My Dove that Dwells in the Holes of the
Rock;</hi> We need not to go far off to seek the Exposition of
these Words, for <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the Rock upon which the Kirk
is builded. Matthew 16. 28. <hi>Vpon this Rock will I Build
my Church,</hi> says <hi>CHRIST.</hi> And Psalms 18. 2. <hi>The LORD
is my Rock and Fortress.</hi> And GOD is also <hi>the Secret
Place of the Stairs,</hi> where the Kirk hides her from the
Storm. So <hi>David</hi> calls GOD his Secret Place, his Hiding
Place. Psalms 32. 7. <hi>Thou art a Secret Place to me from
Distress, Thou wilt Preserve me,</hi> Psalms 91. And because
in all this Song we must ever hold up the Line and String of
the Allegorie of Marriage, and consider the Kirk as the Spouse
of <hi>CHRIST:</hi> The Rock is <hi>CHRIST</hi> in whom the Kirk dwells
by Faith, and <hi>CHRIST</hi> dwells in her Heart, Ephesians 3. 17.
<hi>Abide in Me, and I in you John</hi> 15. 4: Abide in Me as
Branches Imped into the Vine: Now the Imp is ingrafted in
a cutted Stock; <hi>CHRIST</hi> was Hagged, Hewed and Cutted on
the Cross, the Stock wherein we are Ingrafted. <hi>So that the
Holes of the Rock,</hi> may well be exponed (as <hi>Bernard</hi> says)
<hi>to be the Wounds of CHRIST:</hi> So that the Meaning is, <hi>O
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40089:4"/>
O My Dove that by Faith has thy abode in the Wounds
and the Holes made in the Hands and Sides of Crucified
JESVS:</hi> Or, O my Dove that believes and that by Faith
has thy abode in the Wounds and abides in <hi>CHRIST</hi> as an
Imp ingrafted in a Tree, in <hi>CHRIST</hi> when Dead; and so Man
flee into <hi>CHRIST</hi> all Wounded, and Holled for thy Sin, flee
into <hi>CHRIST</hi> thy Rock; and so into <hi>GOD: Psalms</hi> 18. 2.
Hence we see what a Saviour the Kirk believes in; a Saviour
that's GOD and Man, as Man to be a Sufferer, and as GOD
to be a Supporter, which there was great Necessitie of these
Two Natures; GOD would not seek Payment of our Debt
off His Son as GOD; for by the Law He could not answer,
for He was the Creditor, and so could not be the Debtor:
And therefore, for the better Understanding of this, I would
have you with me to consider, how our Nature, and GODs
Nature works to others hands in the Work of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
A Sinner cannot Dwell in <hi>CHRIST</hi> as GOD only. There
is no <hi>Holes</hi> nor Chambers for a Sinner to Dwell in GOD; and
therefore <hi>CHRIST</hi> behoved to be Man, that we might find
fair Chambers in the Wounds of <hi>JESVS,</hi> wherein the <hi>Doves</hi>
of <hi>JESVS</hi> might Dwell; And if He had been only Man, He
could not have been an House upon a Rock, and so could not
have born the Weight of all the <hi>Doves:</hi> For there be some
Questions in the Work of our Redemption that onlie Man can
answer. Man has sinned, and Man must Die, says GODs
Justice, be it so says <hi>CHRIST.</hi> Man sinned, and <hi>I</hi> the Man
<hi>CHRIST</hi> shall Die. (2.) Man took on the Debt, therefore
an other cannot pay for him; Be it so says <hi>CHRIST, I</hi> the
Man shall pay the Ransom. (3.) Man behoved to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends,
because Man did the Fault: Let it be so said <hi>CHRIST,
I</hi> the Man <hi>CHRIST</hi> shall make amends again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If <hi>CHRIST</hi> had not been our <hi>Rock,</hi> there had
been no Dwelling in him, he would not have keeped Wind and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40089:4"/>
Weather off us: Therefore the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was a Pillar
on which the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> did hing, and this is the Cause
why <hi>CHRIST-man</hi> leans to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
in all that he does. For if ye will consider in this Work,
there is Three <hi>Bargains,</hi> or <hi>Covenants</hi> to speak so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> GOD and Man bargained together, ye shall believe,
that's your Part. I shall give you Life Eternal, that's my Part
says GOD. Now Man dare not promise this of himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>CHRIST</hi>s Bond to Relieve him, that is to Enable him
throw his Grace to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> GOD Bargains with his Son, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53. 10. Son,
if Thou shall lay down Thy Life, <hi>Thou shall see Thy Seed, and
Prolong Thy Days,</hi> and have many fair Children, Psalms 2.
<hi>Ye shall have the Heathen to Serve You.</hi> Heb. 1. <hi>I will be
Your Father, and Ye shall be My Son. CHRIST</hi> is content,
but he cannot do this alone; he must borrow Flesh and Blood
from Man, and in it Suffer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Man <hi>CHRIST</hi> Bargains with the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
The <hi>Humane Nature</hi> says, I Love Man, and I will
Die for him: The <hi>Divine Nature</hi> says, now I shall hold
Thee up under Thy Sufferings, and Thou shall overcome Death.
The Man <hi>Christ</hi> without the Back-bond (to speak so) durst
not for Ten Thousand Worlds have ventured to Yoak in the
Fields with the Justice of GOD, and Death, and Hell, and Sin,
and the Devil, except he had the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Union to bear him up under his Sufferings: Therefore
<hi>CHRIST</hi> when he looks upon his Sufferings, looks also upon
his Warrand, Isaiah 56. <hi>I gave My Back to the Smiters,
and My Checks to them that pulled off the Hair.</hi> These
be the Words of the <hi>Man CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because it might have been said a Man will Suffer all
that his alone; But here he looks to his Warrand, <hi>Verse</hi> 7.
and says, I have my Warrand with Me, <hi>The LORD GOD
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40089:5"/>
will help Me, I shall not be confounded.</hi> I have GODs
Warrand who is united to Me in a Personal Union to bear
Me up. Even Sick-like <hi>CHRIST</hi> goes down to the Grave,
Psalms 16. 10. <hi>Thou wilt not leave My Soul in Hell,</hi> (or
the Grave,) <hi>neither wilt Thou suffer Thy Holy One to see Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
As if <hi>Christ</hi> would say, I am sure LORD Thou will
be as Good as Thy Word, and make Good Thy Bargain, and
will Warrand Me against Death: See then how it goes; The
<hi>Man Christ</hi> takes Man by the Hand to bring him out from
under GODs Wrath. So Beloved, Be Glad in such a Saviour,
come all into the <hi>Rock,</hi> for <hi>God, Christ,</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> all these
Three are linked together as in a Chain, and <hi>Christ</hi> in the
middle link of the Chain. Now let all the Kings of the Earth
that boast of Fair Houses and Stately Palaces, come and see if
they can compare with the <hi>Dove that Dwells in the Holes
of the Rock. Nebuchadnezer</hi> said, <hi>Is not this Great</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon
<hi> that I have built,</hi> &amp;c. Surely Men are to be rebuked
that are carefull for Houses and settling in the World, and has
no Assurance of this Lodging. Worldlings are but Ravens that
big in the Wild Mountains. The Kirk is only at Home biging
in Faith: These be indeed Dear Chambers, being built by
<hi>Christ</hi> Himself. GOD has made Holes and Windows in <hi>Christ</hi>
that his <hi>Doves</hi> may flee into, and make their Nest in his
Heart. O Dear and Precious Dwelling; The Lodging cost us
Nothing, yet we are desired to Dwell in it. Now what is
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Petition? <hi>Cause Me to hear thy Voice.</hi> It's ordinary
for Man to beg from GOD, for we be but his Beggars; But
it is a Miracle to see GOD beg at Man; Yet here is the <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
begging from the Clay; the <hi>Saviour</hi> seeking from Sinners.
What is his Suit? It must be some Great Thing; it is even a
Sight of his Bride; He is even saying to her, my dear Spouse
be kind to Me, let me see thy Face, be not Blaite and Waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
be plain with me your Husband, tell me all your mind in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40089:5"/>
Prayer, I delight to hear your lisping and hisping and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to me in Prayer: Ye may see all the Wooing comes on
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Side of it; She cannot hold up her Face, or let one
Love-blink on <hi>Christ,</hi> but as He commands her, and wakens
her up; She is a Soure Bride of her self, if she Laugh, it is He
that makes her Rejoice by the Holy Spirit that is given to her,
<hi>Romans</hi> 5. 5. She keeps her Chamber and is ashamed to go
forth; He bides her be kind and shew her Face. We cannot
Love Him, while he first Love us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. We run
because he draws us, <hi>Canticles 1. 2. John</hi> 6. 44. We appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<hi>Christ,</hi> but we are first gripped of him, <hi>Philippians</hi>
3. 12. Beloved, there is great skill in wooing <hi>Christ,</hi> every
Bride has not the gate of it, but he must teach us.</p>
            <p>In all other Matches ye will find Two Things that are not
here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> In other Matches the Bride makes some Wooing of
her own sort; but here Men cannot move, but as <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Spirit wooes in us, and teaches us. In other Contracts the
Bride and her Friends are bound for their Part, the Bride has
some Toocher of her own, or she may be an Heretrix, she may
have all, and he Nothing: But here the Bridegroom in this
Contract is obliged for all, he give his Name for himself and
his Wife, Ezekel 36. 27. <hi>I will put My Spirit in you, and
cause you to Walk in my Judgements.</hi> Here the <hi>Kirk</hi> has
no Toocher of her own, and yet she has not the Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to look up to her <hi>LORD,</hi> but as he commands and holds
up her Head: All the Toocher is <hi>Christ</hi>'s, and the Inheritance
is <hi>Christs;</hi> the <hi>Kirk</hi> has Nothing, he has the Houses, <hi>John</hi>
14. He has the Land, <hi>Romans</hi> 8. The Fine Gold, <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
3. and buys the Spousing Cloaths of the Religion that
came in with her Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> and that is the best Religion
in the World; for it gives most to GOD and least to Man. I
will tell you who are meet for <hi>Christ,</hi> even these that are out of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40089:6"/>
themselves, and lays all upon <hi>Christ.</hi> The best Schollars
that <hi>Christ</hi> gets are Publicans and Sinners, Whores, Harlots,
Blind, Lame, Criples, and such like, and such as feels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Sinners. Look how much ye trust in your selves, and
rest upon the World, and Loves your Lusts, as far ye are from
<hi>Christ;</hi> and when ye are all out of your selves, and changed
<hi>into GOD's Image from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit
of the LORD,</hi> 2 Corinthians 3: 18: then ye are meet for
<hi>Christ,</hi> begging Poor Sinners are our <hi>LORD</hi>s Schollars. The
Lintel-stone of our <hi>LORD</hi>s School-door is a Low-stone, ye
must stoup Low and Lout; Ye will be on your Knees with it
or ye can win in; Ye must be very humble, else that Stone
will take your head and ding you back, and ye will not win
in; than be Fools that Christ may be your Wisdom, 1 <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
1: 30: There is as much merit in Christ as will buy
a Thousand Heavens. Now if our Wooer Christ were not
Kind, and sought our Kindness, even Words of us, and brought
the Love. Tokens, the Friendship betwixt Christ and us would
soon wear out of Date, &amp; grow Cold; Christ ay blows at the
Coal ere it wear out: Christ would win a Friend, yea a Foe
to be kind to him; He is ay thriping and claiming Kindness
of us, as if he were the Beggar and the Poor-man, and we the
King. O he claims Kindness to us. Then surely we need not
think shame of our Friend. Would ye ken for whom Christ
Died, and Payed, even for <hi>Dyvours,</hi> such as Swore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bare, and came out of Prison upon Caution, or a <hi>Cessio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonorum.</hi>
Poor-men that has been upon the Dyvours-stone,
and are far from Payment by the <hi>Dyvour-bill,</hi> when there
is not a finger in all your hand fastened upon your self, then ye
are meet for Christ: For who are better met and yoaked than
a Poor Sick Dying-man and a skillfull Physician; Who is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
yoaked than a crying Begging-sinner and a Rich Christ?
But oh it is ofttimes not so! for Christ would give us more nor
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40089:6"/>
we will receive: He scatters his Gold, we Proud Beggars will
not bow our back, and lout down and gather: He would fain
Sell, we will not Buy, so there will be no blocking. <hi>Let Me
see thy Countenance.</hi> An Allusion to <hi>Israel</hi> that was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves before the LORD Thrice a Year in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;
The meaning is, Walk before me. It is not enough
that thou believe, and so dwell by Faith <hi>in the Holes of the
Rock;</hi> but thou must also shew thy Faith by Good Works and
Prayers, and Worshipping of GOD. Christ loves not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
that never wan or Love to Pray, and such as hates not
the World: But you will see they are Believers by their Holy
Living, <hi>Matthew</hi> 13: The VVord of GOD is Seed sown that
brings forth Thirty, Sixty, and an Hundred Fold; Ilk Boll
brings out Thirty; Ilk Sermon, ilk Communion should bring
out an Hundred Good VVorks (Beloved) GOD's Land is
Set at an High-price; he is a Master that will have all his own
from his Tennents; and as the Song says, Every one of GODs
Sheep brings out Twins, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 7: 8: There is a Ground
that drinks in Rain from Heaven, and yet brings forth Briers
and Thorns, it is near a Curse: Bring forth Fruit, or else ye
will make GOD say, my Curse, and GODs Mallison be upon
thy Heart, thou hears much, and brings forth no Fruit: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beware (Beloved) a Tree that once gets a dadd with
GODs Ax, it will never do well again: Ye shall become like
the Girdle, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 13: 17: which he did hide at the River
<hi>Euphrates;</hi> it was profitable for nothing, it was marred, it
shall never go about GODs Wast again. Beware then that
ye be not Blasted Professors &amp; Fruitless Christians; but be ye
always in his Sight: For there be some that comes never in
GODs Sight, they are GODs <hi>Dyvours:</hi> They are aughting
so much that they dar not come to GOD, and Compt and
Pay, Outlaws and Borderers that comes not, or keeps not
Christs Kingdom; but runs like Wild Asses and Drumadaries
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40089:7"/>
up and down the Mountains, and snuffs up the Wind at their
Pleasure: I compare their Life to those that rides Post. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a Horse has Satan in his Stable; and when these Out-laws
has wearied their Greediness after Sin, and has gotten they
know not what, they mount upon a Fresh-horse; Some u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Pride, and they ride once out of GODs Sight, they run
while they be in Hell in the end: For the Devil is upon the
Horse and the Rider. GOD seeks Dear, and for his Money
ye must give him more than Ten in the Hunder; For Five
Talents, he must have Ten again, he must have double Stock.
Look what Grace ye receive by Weight, render to him his
own in Weight and more: If his Gold want an Ounce, he will
cast it to you again: For one Bolls sowing, ye must give him
Thirty again: GOD would have his Servants ay keeping his
Chamber, if they go their own length from him he misses them;
Ye must not be GODs Chamber-pages, and steal out of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and give the Devil a Baggadge-yoaking; nay he must ay
see your Face, and hear your Voice. There be many that would
serve GOD, and be in Christs School; but they are like Trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands
that takes the Play, and runs to Play, sometimes with
the World, and the Devil, and loves to sport themselves with
the World and the Devil; But GODs Schollars may not take
the Play. <hi>Let me see thy Face.</hi> The <hi>Kirk</hi> might have said,
Dear <hi>LORD,</hi> my Face; Oh does Thou desire to see my Face,
it is very Black, I am Sun-burnt, Sin hath made me deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and for my Voice, it is both Harsh and Mistuned. What
then says Christ? I think not so my <hi>Dear Spouse;</hi> I think it
is a Fair Face; I think ye have a Sweet Voice. It is Great
Comfort for <hi>GOD</hi>s Children when they rise many times off
their Knees from Prayer with a woe heart, thinking, because they
have no Heart, nor Feeling, nor Sence, that <hi>GOD</hi> is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Prayers, and thinks little of their Works; when
as their Prayers, and Tears, and Works are accepted before
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40089:7"/>
GOD. Ye think nothing of one Tear, yet GOD puts it in
his Bottle; and nothing of one Sigh, but GOD gathers it in
his Treasure. If GOD thought of us as the World does, and
as we think of our Selves, oftentimes wofull would our Case
be; But GOD has not a Pleasanter Sight in the World, nor
the Face of a Child of GOD: No Musick Delights Him more
nor the Sighs and Tears, Complaints and Prayers of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
See ye not the Spirit of GOD bringing in <hi>Christ</hi> long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a Sight of his Wife, longing for a Word of her, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs
8. 31. Christ</hi> Rejoiceth and Sports, and Plays in the
Habitable Parts of the Earth, and his Delight is with the Sons
of Men. Ye will see more of this upon the last words of this
Song.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take us the Foxes.</hi> It's a Speech of <hi>Christ</hi> to take the
<hi>Kirk,</hi> to take, Convince, Censure, Rebuke, Cut off, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat
all Inordinate Livers and Offenders in the LORDs
Vineyard, Ezekiel 13. 4. <hi>O Israel, thy Prophets are like
Foxes in the Deserts.</hi> Jeremiah 12. 10. <hi>Many Pastors have
Corrupted My Vineyard.</hi> O what can there be upon the
Earth to make a Kirk Happy, But it is here. To hear a Kirk
Sick of Love for <hi>Christ,</hi> and here <hi>Christ</hi> Sick of Love for
his Kirk: <hi>Christs Left Hand is under Her Head, and His
Right Hand doth Imbrace Her: She is His Fair One, His
Love, His Dove, His Vndefiled: She Dwells in the Wounds
of Her Lord by Faith.</hi> Yet for all this, His Kirk <hi>is a
Vineyard that has many Foxes in it to Destroy the Vines.</hi>
Then we see, so long as GOD hath a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> there will be
<hi>Foxes</hi> in it to Destroy the <hi>Vines;</hi> That is, Crafty-men, False-Teachers,
Deceitfull-Workers, Transforming themselves into
the Apostles of <hi>Christ, 2 Corinthians 1. 13. Paul</hi> Planted
a Church in <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20. 28. yet after his Departure,
<hi>Grievous Wolves entred in not Sparing the Flock.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this Life Marches are not redd betwixt GOD and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40089:8"/>
Devil; The Devil Fyles the Score, and comes over the March
upon GODs Bounds. <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. GOD Sows his Wheat,
and the Devil steals up the Rigg, and with Hot-furr he Sows
his Tares. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. In <hi>Achab</hi>'s Court there is never a
Honest-Man till he be Tryed: The False-Knave and <hi>Truth</hi>
are Door-Neighbours. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. In <hi>Achab</hi>'s Court there
is an Honest-Man that tells the King the Truth; But there is
Four Hundred False-Knaves that says against him, and Poor-Man
he must to Prison, and they get leave to keep the Court;
for the Thief is ever the Honest-Man till he be Tryed; The
False-Knave and the <hi>Truth</hi> are Door-Neighbours, and almost
Twins born at one Time; howbeit <hi>Truth</hi> be Eldest and First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<hi>Isaiah</hi> Complains Chapter 46. <hi>Of Dumb Dogs that
could never have enough. Jeremiah</hi> 10. He Complains <hi>of
many Pastors that Corrupted the Vineyard. Ezekiel</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<hi>of Foxes. Zachariah 11. Of Idol-Shepherds. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineus
and Philetus</hi> spoke against <hi>Paul.</hi> The <hi>Sadducees</hi>
in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Days Denyed the <hi>Resurrection:</hi> And not only is
there False Teachers in our Days, but in the Best Kirks were,
and are many <hi>Foxes;</hi> for all is not <hi>Fish</hi> that comes in the Net:
And if ye be GODs Sheep, ye must not think to want <hi>Foxes</hi>
to Nibble, and to Work under the Earth to Destroy you; Ye
may not look that <hi>Christ</hi> is Master of the Fields without
Blood: Ye will not be long in Prosperity in the World. There
be a Number of Foolish People wonders that GOD brings
such a Good Husband that should not hold out the <hi>Foxes</hi>
from his own <hi>Vineyard;</hi> They would have a <hi>Christ</hi> of Gold,
and a <hi>Kirk</hi> of Velvet, or of Fair White Paper; They think
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Bride should be Clade in Purple and Scarlet as the
Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> is, or does Wear.</p>
            <p>I will shew you how <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Kirk</hi> meets when the
Bridegroom Wooed his Kirk; Many a Black Stroak got He
both of GOD and Man. He was the <hi>Vine,</hi> GOD and Man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40089:8"/>
strake at him with Axes; he Bought him Dear; it cost him
Blood ere he got her: And think ye she has Fair Weather when
she Wooes him? Nay, many a Cuffe gets she from the World;
This <hi>Fox,</hi> and that <hi>Fox</hi> pulls the Skin off her: She is hardly
handled in this Wooing, there be Stroaks on both Sides: For
fain would the Devil have the <hi>Contract</hi> Cancelled, and the
<hi>Marriage</hi> going back. And let me speak to you that are GODs
<hi>Young Vine,</hi> make you for it, the <hi>Foxes</hi> of the World will
Peel the Bark off you; If there be Grace in you, they will do
what they can to eat it up in the bud; Hold your hands about
the Grace of GOD, be not Robbed; And ye give them their
Will, they would pull the Skin off your Face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye see <hi>Christ</hi> hath gotten out <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
against all his <hi>Foxes:</hi> Here is a Commission obtained in
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Court, that all that hurts <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Vineyard</hi> should be
Apprehended and laid fast: But alas! the Commissioners, the
Pastors, the Judges over-sees them: But here a Comfort for
you, who are the <hi>LORD</hi>s <hi>Vines,</hi> that are troubled with <hi>Foxes,</hi>
I assure you, that the <hi>Kirk</hi> has <hi>Law</hi> against all her Enemies:
Be not casten down, because the World Hates you; Twenty
six Hunder years syn <hi>Christ</hi> hath given out a <hi>Decreet</hi> against
all his Enemies, and Yours, to take them. Here ye have
Assurance; Your Enemies are Rebels, and all of them under
<hi>Caption,</hi> Psalms 110. 6. <hi>He shall fill the Places with Dead Bodies.</hi> He shall Wound the Head over them, even in many
Countries. Ye that Complain of your Predominant Sin, and
thinks ye are hardned with them (for these be also <hi>Foxes</hi>
that do Harm the <hi>LORD</hi>s <hi>Vineyard</hi>) fight against them, for
<hi>Christ</hi> has given out a <hi>Decreet</hi> against those that they shall be
taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Beloved is Mine.</hi> These be the Words of the <hi>Contract</hi>
of <hi>Marriage;</hi> For there is a <hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and
his <hi>Kirk,</hi> Ezekiel 36. <hi>I will be Their GOD, and They shal
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40089:9"/>
be My People.</hi> But here an <hi>Doubt</hi> to be answered by these
Words: It would seem <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Kirk</hi> are Two Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Parties in the <hi>Contract; Christ</hi> upon the one side, and the
<hi>Kirk</hi> upon the other: Is not <hi>Christ</hi> upon the <hi>Kirks</hi> Side, and
obliges for his <hi>Wife?</hi> I Answer, <hi>Christ</hi> having Two Natures,
has Two Contrary Considerations, and yet he is one Party, and
we another, and so Promises to us <hi>Life Eternal;</hi> and we
Promise by his Grace <hi>to Believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Christ</hi> is considered as <hi>Mediator,</hi> GOD and
Man, and so he is upon our Side; for the Promise is made to
Him and His; And he as <hi>Principal-Contractor</hi> binds for Us,
and we are his <hi>Assigneys;</hi> So <hi>Jesus</hi> skips betwixt both the
Sides, because he is a Friend to both: But it is certain these
very Words proves him to be on our Side of the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
because <hi>our Beloved is Ours, and we are His;</hi> He is our
<hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Cautioner</hi> bound for Us. The very Words of
the <hi>Covenant</hi> are spoken to <hi>Christ,</hi> Psalms 87. 27. <hi>I will make
Him My First-born Higher then the Kings of the Earth:</hi>
But he said, Verse 26. <hi>He shall cry to Me, Thou art My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
My GOD, and the Rock of My Salvation: My Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
will I keep for Him for evermore, and My Covenant
shall stand Fast with Him.</hi> The Enemies of <hi>Grace</hi> would
have <hi>Christ</hi> a GOD folding his Fingers, and a Looker on, and
beholding Fair Play. Lyars, he is more than Half-play ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
The Devil will not get his Name out of the <hi>Contract:</hi>
And Beloved, see ye not but it is a Sweet Thing to have any
thing to do with <hi>Christ.</hi> His Chaffe is better than other Mens
Corn; If ye have any fastning with <hi>Christ</hi> the Cause is Won;
Now hold you be <hi>Christ,</hi> it is a shame for him that ye fall out
of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> because he is <hi>Cautioner;</hi> as ye know, it is
a shame for a Nobleman that his Poor Friend be cast in Prison
for the Debt that he is obliged to pay: <hi>Christ</hi> is now obliged
that He fullfill the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and make Good both your Part,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40089:9"/>
and his Part: Boast not of your Selves, or of your own Strength;
be not Proud of your Selves, but ye shall have full Liberty
to boast your Self of <hi>Christ,</hi> Crac enough of <hi>Christ;</hi> be Proud
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Merits, ye cannot erre there; The Debt of Faith
and Obedience that we are aughting to GOD now to speak
so) is not our Debt but <hi>Christs,</hi> and he is <hi>Cautioner</hi> for us:
It were a shame that a Poor Friend should be Imprisoned for
his Chiefs Debt, especially since he is a Rich-man and able to
pay.</p>
            <p>Now let us consider the Mutual Interest, <hi>Christ</hi> and the
<hi>Kirk,</hi> has every one of another: He is Mine, and I am His;
He is my Husband, and I am His Wife; He is my Head, and
I am His Body; He is my King, and I am His People; He is
my Rich Cautioner, and I am His Dyvour.</p>
            <p>Now let us see what claim <hi>Christ</hi> has in the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and what
claim the <hi>Kirk</hi> has in <hi>Christ.</hi> Now to hold upon the Comparison
of this Song betwixt a <hi>Husband</hi> and a <hi>Wife;</hi> for the <hi>Husband</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Wife</hi> has no Sundry Goods; if he be a <hi>King,</hi> she is a <hi>Queen;</hi>
If he have a fair Inheritance, it is hers also, as long as he Lives;
If they Live ever together, it is ever hers: Then when she says,
he is mine, I am his, <hi>CHRIST</hi> is mine, and I am his, and
all his, his Flesh, and his Blood; his Death and Merits; his
Glory; his Kingdom; his Court and Credit, and all is Mine;
and all Mine is His, my Soul and Body, my Sins, my Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
my Cross, they are all His. <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>She</hi> is (to
speak so) carded throw other, John 15. <hi>Abide in Me, and
I in You:</hi> Cursed be he that says not <hi>Amen</hi> to that; John 17.
21. <hi>That they also may be one, as Thou Father art in Me,
and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Vs: I in them,
and they in Me.</hi> But we will labour to Reduce them, the
Particulars to a certain Number. There be these Things Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to us betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and Us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> There is a Sibness of Nature betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and us.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40089:10"/>
There be Pawns given and received betwixt both Sides; He
has a Pawn of Ours, Our Flesh, and he took that Pawn with
him to heaven, and he is never minded to give it again; but
we have as Good a Pawn of him, his Spirit; We were of
that Flesh and Blood. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2. 14. Let us keep <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Pawn as long as he keeps Ours; Let him not be to the fore
with Us: Now he keeps our Pawn for ever; He will never
lay down our Flesh; We are never minded to lose the Pawn,
let him keep it for ever; Long may he keep it: Let us keep
his Spirit; For it is not his Will to loose that Pawn; Let
him keep it for ever, <hi>Hebrews 4. 2. Christ</hi> would also be a
Bairn and Partaker of Flesh and Blood. Would to GOD ye
would all strive to get his Pawn, and to keep it well; Seek
his Spirit, and keep it well. Worldly Men, Ye have little
claim to <hi>Jesus;</hi> GOD help you, there is no Borrowing nor
Lending betwixt You and <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Community; We got all his Good, and he gets
all our Ill, that's a Good Cooss for Us; He took our Curses,
we took his Blessings; He our Shame, We his Glory; He our
Sins, We his Righteousness: He is the <hi>Kirks,</hi> and the <hi>Kirk</hi>
is <hi>Christs;</hi> That Day GOD laid upon <hi>Christ,</hi> he was shifted
our from under GODs Wrath, and GOD strook the <hi>Kirk</hi>'s
Head, to let the Members go free. When <hi>Christ</hi> was in
blocking to buy his <hi>Kirk,</hi> he knew the Faults in the Wares;
he kend well enough that Curse of GOD, and Wrath of GOD,
and Hell, and Sin, and many Ills followed the <hi>Kirk:</hi> Yet
<hi>Christ</hi> wad not rew in time; He said freely I will take her, and
all the Ills that follow her, how beit she be Blind, Lame, yea,
a Cursed Bride; Yet I will make her my <hi>Wife.</hi> Would to
GOD we could take <hi>Christ</hi> and all the faults that follow
Him. There be Men that will not Cooss with <hi>Christ;</hi> but
will keep their Will, their Lust: GOD was about to strike Us,
and had lifted (to speak so) his Wand to bring a Stroak of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40089:10"/>
his Wrath upon Us; and <hi>Christ</hi> came in, and held his Hand,
and laid down himself, and bade his Father lay upon Him:
Yea never saw such a Suiter as <hi>Christ,</hi> he prays Us to Cooss
for the better; He crys to you for GODs Sake give me your
Dross, and ye shall get my Gold; Give me your Sins, and I
give you My Righteousness. Is it not an hard matter? Men
will not give their Ill to <hi>Christ,</hi> and transfer and give over
their Sins to <hi>Christ.</hi> He says to you, Give Me your Lust
that I may Crucifie it, and I will give you Love for it: Give
Me your Anger, and I will give you My Zeal for it. Then
make a Cooss and take him at his Word, ilk day be making
New Blocks with <hi>Christ;</hi> Deny your Folly, and give it to him
to Crucifie; And seek ye his Wisdom, you must do this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
while all Nature be away and done, and nothing in you
but Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a Community of Gifts and Graces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Christ</hi> and Us. Not a Grace we get from GOD, but
it comes throw <hi>Christ</hi>'s hands to us: So that <hi>Christ</hi> keeps the
Pawns betwixt GOD and Us: GOD gives Grace to his <hi>Kirk,</hi>
but where is it? It is in <hi>Jesus.</hi> Grace is laid in Pledge in the
Hands of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and it was made a running over Fountain:
For as we see in a Race, the Wages, or the Garland is not in
the Hand of the Runners, but some Friends keeps the Staikes
for both: So <hi>Christ</hi> keeps the Wage for the <hi>Father</hi> and Us.
<hi>Christ</hi> indeed is the Fountain. John 1. I4 <hi>We beheld His
Glory, as the Glory of the Only begotten Son.</hi> Some Friend
keeps the Staikes for both; There the Well running over, But
for what End? Verse 16. <hi>That out of His Fulness we might
all Receive, even Grace for Grace.</hi> So GOD gives us Life
Eternal. But who has this Life in Pledge? Even <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
1 John 5. 11. <hi>And this is the Witness that GOD hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
us, even Eternal Life; and this Life is in His Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
LORD</hi> send us part of this <hi>consigned Grace.</hi> Again ye send
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40089:11"/>
not up a Sigh to GOD; but first it must be laid down in the hand
of him that keeps the Pawns, <hi>Revelation</hi> 8. 12. Be the Way
I shall give the <hi>Vse</hi> with every <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine;</hi>
Try thy Light, try thy Grace, try thy Honour, and Credit,
Riches, &amp; all the Blessings that ye have; The Silver, &amp; the
Gold, whether these Blessings be Impawned in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Hand
or ye get them; If ye get them not in <hi>Christ,</hi> they are Unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
Blessings, and they want the Fashion. Wo be to these
Blessings that came never throw <hi>Christ</hi>'s Holy Hands. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
try your Prayers, Sighs and Desires, and your Service,
if ye offer them to <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>CHRIST:</hi> Many Unchristened
Prayers goes to Heaven that are never Welcomed of <hi>GOD.</hi> Ye
must take your Communion out of <hi>GOD</hi>s Hand at the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
but out of <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s Hand there should be nothing done
betwixt <hi>GOD</hi> and Us; but <hi>CHRIST</hi> should be at it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is a Community of Sufferings betwixt
<hi>CHRIST</hi> and Us. Poor would we be, if his Sufferings were
not Ours; and Wo would be our Case if his Sufferings were
not Ours: But this Way it goes, he is that <hi>Apple Tree</hi> Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
above all the Trees of the <hi>Forrest,</hi> and we do Rest under
the <hi>Tree,</hi> now when the Shower of Rain falls, it lights first on
the <hi>Tree,</hi> and the Stroak of it is broken, and it does not great
Harm to these that are under the <hi>Tree.</hi> Ilk New Shot at the
<hi>Kirk,</hi> lights first on the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and he breaks the
Point of the Arrow. If ye be Ill-spoken off, so was He; If ye
be Hated of the World, so was He; If your Blood be shed,
&amp; your Face Deformed, so was his fair Face Deformed &amp; Marred,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 14. be content to Drink with <hi>Christ.</hi> Wo be to them that
are not in <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet are in Trouble: The Arrow with the
Sharp Point comes upon them, &amp; goes to their Heart, &amp; Slays
them. Try if your Troubles be Christened-Troubles, that
lights first upon <hi>CHRIST</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> &amp; then upon you as the
<hi>Members.</hi> Try if by Faith ye have an Union with him. Now
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40089:11"/>
here by the way a Great Comfort in Trouble: Those that are
Dear to you Dyes, &amp; ye Mourn: <hi>Christ</hi> Mourned &amp; Groaned in
Spirit for Dead <hi>Lazarus:</hi> Ye Weep, so he Weeped. Are ye
Poor, and ay at the Borrowing; So was <hi>Christ</hi> at the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
Trade all his Days: Should ye not then with Good
Will Drink off the Cup that He Drank off before you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
ye Murmure, and will not Drink Willingly, ye Refuse to Pledge
<hi>Christ:</hi> But ye must Pledge Him, and Drink with <hi>GOD</hi>'s
Blessing, and with Joy, He will not Poyson you. They are
none of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Friends that will not Pledge Him, <hi>Matth.</hi>
20: 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is a Community of Glory betwixt <hi>Christ</hi>
and Us: The Heaven that the <hi>Mediator Christ</hi> Enjoys, is
our Heaven; Our Heaven is to the <hi>Man Christ</hi> in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
Heaven was bought with Blood to Him and Us, and to
make you Rejoice: None of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Children gets a Heaven
properly of their own; Why? We got a share and part of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Inheritance, He</hi> is the Principal Heir,
<hi>Romans</hi> 8.
We are the Conjunct-heirs: Sweet is that Word which <hi>He</hi>
speaks to his Children, Luke 22. 29. <hi>And I appoint unto
You a Kingdom, as My Father hath appointed unto Me,
that ye may Eat and Drink at My Table in My Kingdom,
Sitting on Thrones, Judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi>
The Meaning is, My Father hath made a <hi>Disposition</hi> to Me
of the Kingdom of <hi>GOD,</hi> it is Mine and My Dear Children.
I will think Heaven uncouth if ye be not with Me. Here
I make a <hi>Disposition</hi> and <hi>Resignation</hi> of that Kingdom to you;
Ye shall Sit at my Table in My Kingdom: Up your Heart,
howbeit ye be not Lords in Earth, ye shall be Lords in Heaven;
<hi>I</hi> and Ye shall part Kingdoms and Thrones together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Rejoice in this ye that are in <hi>Christ</hi> and see your
Condition, ye and <hi>Christ</hi> are Halfers together of Heaven and
Glory, O if <hi>GOD</hi>'s Children be in a Sweet Case as long as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40089:12"/>
               <hi>Christ</hi> is in Heaven and keeps the Inheritance, as long shall
we keep our Right; And who can cause him Flit? The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
hath made these Enemies of the Grace of <hi>GOD</hi> to Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
all our communion with <hi>Christ,</hi> they have put <hi>Christ</hi>
and the <hi>Elect</hi> together, as a Man in an Inns for a Night, and
to go away to Morrow; They have yoaked <hi>Christ</hi> and us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as if <hi>He</hi> were one and we another; as if <hi>He</hi> were <hi>His</hi>
own, and We were our own; as if <hi>Christ</hi> had no Law and
Right to Us, and We had no Law and Right to <hi>Christ,</hi> but
met at a Venture, and sundered at a Venture; as if We had
one heaven, and <hi>He</hi> had another; As if <hi>he</hi> had <hi>his</hi> Portion
by <hi>himself</hi> alone, and that <hi>he</hi> keeps for ever; and that We
had our Share be our alone too, to Sell when We pleased. Sells
if we Dispone Heaven, We Dispone not <hi>Christ</hi>'s Heaven. In
the Fighting <hi>he</hi> fights all the Battles <hi>his</hi> alone, We but look
on: But when it comes to the Dividing of the Spoil, We get
a Rich Share of the Spoil, Yet <hi>he</hi> gave the Whole Sum for the
Inheritance, and We Nothing; yet we are set at <hi>his</hi> Elbow
in a Throne with <hi>him,</hi> Now seeing our Right is also Good,
slip not from them: Do not as some Unworthy Heir, who
having a Good Right slips from it for a feckless composition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Drink, quites all, howbeit he should Beg: Indeed the
Wicked does this. The Devil drinks them Blankfull, and fills
them with Worldly Pleasures, and garrs them Subscrive a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,
and gives them an unworthy composition, some
present Pleasure. Compone not with the Devil to go to the
Law with him, let <hi>Christ</hi> be your <hi>Advocat,</hi> Subscrive not a
Submission with the Devil, come never in Trysting Terms with
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hold you aback from the World, and the Lusts of it, it
is the Devil's Arles that he gives to Silly Drunken Heirs, when
they cry <hi>Hills and Mountains fall on Vs:</hi> They would
fain give back the Arles and Rew, but it is out of time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I am His.</hi> This Property of the <hi>covenant</hi> is Mutual,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40089:12"/>
as she says and acknowledges that <hi>he</hi> is hers, and so <hi>Christ</hi>
is bound to her by <hi>his</hi> Promise: So she acknowledges that
she is bound to <hi>him,</hi> and is <hi>his</hi> by Right, Multitudes of the
World would play fast and loose with <hi>him:</hi> They would have
<hi>Christ</hi> fast, and themselves loose: They devise a covenant of
their own, and says, <hi>Christ</hi> Died for All, and <hi>GOD</hi> is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to All, and <hi>GOD</hi> will Relieve All Christian Souls from
Hell, and they think <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>CHRIST</hi> fast enough to them:
But in the mean time they are loose, and Lives like Dogs and
Swine in their Filthiness: These Men would have <hi>Christ</hi> as
a Child in making of the <hi>covenant,</hi> and exceeding Silly:
should <hi>Christ</hi> give <hi>himself</hi> for you, and will ye neither give
Life nor Goods for him? <hi>Christ</hi> came to save you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28.
And will ye be <hi>his</hi> Master? Are ye not obliged to
Serve <hi>him?</hi> This is to make a Gospel of your own: Too many
Obeys the <hi>Gospel</hi> as long as it Flatters them. As long as it tells
them <hi>Christ</hi>'s Parts, and that <hi>he</hi> shed <hi>his</hi> Blood, and came to
save <hi>Sinners</hi> freely: That is the best Chapter in all the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
But when the <hi>Gospel</hi> begins to tell them what is their
Part, and that they must Deny Themselves, Crucifie their
Lusts, to Take up <hi>Christ</hi>'s Heavy Cross, they start aback:
These are Tender-footed-Christians that Walks in the <hi>Law,</hi>
and in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> so long as they go softly on it as a Bed of
Roses, and Hurts not their Feet: But when a Thorn of the
Command touches them, they stand aback. Ye may not half
<hi>GOD</hi>'s <hi>Law,</hi> and take as much of it as serves you. As
<hi>Christ</hi> gave <hi>himself</hi> to be Yours, and has Subscrived the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract;</hi>
So give your Selves to <hi>Him,</hi> and Subscrive your Part
of the <hi>Contract</hi> to be <hi>his,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> is Yours; Take
therefore
the <hi>Law</hi> and this Sweet <hi>Saviour</hi> both together, bind your
Selves to <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>his,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> is bound to be Yours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He Feedeth among the Lillies.</hi> To prove that <hi>Christ</hi> doth
Esteem her as <hi>his Kirk</hi> and <hi>Flock, his Wife, his Beloved:</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40089:13"/>
She says, <hi>He Feeds her amongst the Lillies,</hi> that is, the Pure
and Uncorrupted <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> or <hi>the Lillies</hi> are the Fruits
of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> opposed to Stinking Roots, and Bitter Roots
that grow in the <hi>Kirk:</hi> When Judgement is like Hemlock, or
Wormwood: Or <hi>the Lillies,</hi> the Saints of <hi>GOD,</hi> that are
Lillies amongst Thorns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> However it be, it is certain the <hi>LORD</hi> feeds <hi>his
Kirk</hi> with as much Spiritual Food as holds in their Life in
the Way to Heaven, while their Day of Marriage come, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
8. 23. We receive here the first Fruits. When a Man
has shorn a stouk of his corn-field, that puts him in assurance
of the whole croop. <hi>GOD</hi> would have <hi>Israel</hi> to Taste of the
Vine Grapes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to assure them they should get
the Land it self, 2 <hi>Chronicles 1. 22 GOD</hi> hath sealed us and
given us the Earnest of <hi>his</hi> Spirit in our Hearts. There be
Two Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, GOD</hi> does with <hi>his</hi> Children in this Life as a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
does with his Wares he has bought, because he cannot
Transport them presently, he puts a Seal or Mark upon them,
and then it may be Sold to no other Body, and his Children
stricks hands, he writes his Name, and his Arms; the Image
of <hi>GOD</hi> in their Soul; and then when the Devil comes throw
the Mercat to buy, for he offers ay Money in hand, Pleasure,
Lusts, Honours: Ye have an Answer to give him; Tell him,
your Soul is sealed already; You have blocked with an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Merchant; <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>he</hi> has put <hi>his</hi> Mark upon you that
ye may not Sell; and it were a pity to beguile <hi>him.</hi> And
therefore bid that Deceiving Loun go seek his Mercat in another
place; ye are not his Merchant. The Devil will promise them
as fair as <hi>GOD:</hi> he will not prig with them: he will not care
to promise much more than Heaven. She shall be like <hi>GOD:</hi>
But he pays not so well as <hi>GOD</hi> doth: Agree not with him:
Block not with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:40089:13"/>
There is another Sweet Word used, that <hi>GOD</hi> gives to <hi>his</hi>
Children, <hi>The Earnest of His Spirit</hi> in this Life; <hi>He</hi> gives
them Arles, <hi>Faith, Hope, Joy,</hi> these be like Six or Seven Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to warrand that; Ye shall get the Principal (Beloved)
had <hi>GOD</hi> blocked with you, and given you Arles, <hi>he</hi> would
therefore that the Bargain hold. Will ye not then take <hi>GOD</hi>s
Arles, and block with the Devil? By <hi>GOD</hi>'s Arles ye have
Assurance of this, <hi>GOD</hi> will come and Loose <hi>his</hi> Arles; Rew
not of the block, never any Man had cause to Rew the block
with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> There is another Word used, <hi>John 16.
Christ</hi> is going to Heaven to Leave <hi>His Disciples; He</hi> promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to come again to them to see them: How Sorry were they
to want <hi>him,</hi> and blyth were they of that word that <hi>he</hi> said, <hi>he
will come again:</hi> Therefore in Sign and Token that <hi>he</hi> would
come again; <hi>he</hi> promised them a Pawn, that was <hi>His Holy
Spirit.</hi> Ye know <hi>Christ</hi> and We are <hi>contracted</hi> in this Life;
We will be Married again at the Day <hi>he</hi> comes to Judge the
World. Now all the Wooing-Time, there goes Love-Tokens
betwixt Them, and Missive-Letters. Tell me when ye got a
Letter last from <hi>Christ;</hi> There will be Messengers going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
You. The same Word is a Messenger, the <hi>Sacraments</hi>
are Love-Tokens that our Wooer has left to assure us that <hi>he</hi>
is <hi>contracted</hi> with Us. I pray you take no Gifts from the
Devil; away with Ill-Conquest: Away with Lusts, and the
Love of the World. I hope ye are not minded to Marry with
Sin; if ye do, ye are ashamed then for all your Days: Ye are
come off <hi>GOD</hi>'s House, and are <hi>his</hi> Image: Fy, it is a shame
to hear tell of it, to Marry with a Base Slave the Devil: I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you here to be Wife and Prudent in your Marriage; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
not for Gear, keep your self to be a Good Match. There be a
sort of Indifferent-men, that ye call Harmless-meu, they have
neither Good nor Ill, they Love not Falshood, they Love not
<hi>Popery,</hi> and yet they will not Burn for the <hi>Truth;</hi> They are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40089:14"/>
like Blank-paper, as it is thought, neither <hi>GOD</hi> nor the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
has blocked with them: But has not <hi>GOD</hi> given you Arles,
nor no Pawn? Satan will get you: But do this first, hold your
self with <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; then ye have an Answer to give other Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the World and the Devil: Ye may Laugh and say, ye are
too long in coming; I have promised my Self away to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Husband, and therefore I cannot have you also; for I
will not have Two Husbands, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. The Apostle takes
a Reason to Prove that the Body should not be given to an
Harlot; it is the Temple of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Set the House of
your Soul to GOD, and then for shame ye cannot win off
<hi>him</hi> to cause <hi>him</hi> Flit. Ye are bought with a Price,; Married
Folk has not many Wooers: The Devil is busie to seek them
that are Virgins, and Love not <hi>Christ</hi> to be their Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>While the Day Dawn.</hi> That is, The <hi>Marriage-day;</hi> and
in <hi>Hebrew</hi> called <hi>Your Day</hi> for Excellency. To say the
Truth, it is a Day, and called the Day of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Day of
<hi>Redemption, 2 Timothy</hi> 1. 2. It is called the <hi>Day</hi> for these
Causes. It is the Day when <hi>Christ</hi> is Perfect in <hi>his</hi> Members.
Now <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body is Mangled, Arms, and Legs, and Hands,
in sundry places; Some not Born, some Born: But in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
Service, some Rotten in the Earth, and casten in the Sea.
<hi>Christ</hi> is Bleeding in <hi>his</hi> Members; There is many a Wound in
the Mystical-Body of <hi>Christ</hi> this Day; all will be gathered in
that <hi>he</hi> gets: <hi>His</hi> Bride <hi>he</hi> enters in Peaceable Possession of
Her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Day <hi>Christ</hi> shall give in <hi>his</hi> Accompts, and
all <hi>his Fathers</hi> Generally; <hi>he</hi> shall Render an Accompt of all
that <hi>he</hi> took by the Hand, and shall put up <hi>his</hi> Sword, and
never Draw it again; And as the Chief- <hi>Shepherd, he</hi> shall
make an Accompt of all <hi>his Lambs,</hi> and tell <hi>his Father,</hi> these
be all <hi>My</hi> Silly-<hi>Sheep;</hi> They have win away with their Life.
I went throw Woods, and Waters, and Briers, and Thorns to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40089:14"/>
Gather them in, and <hi>My</hi> Feet was <hi>Pricked,</hi> and <hi>My</hi> Hands
and <hi>My</hi> Side <hi>Pierced</hi> ere I could get a grip of them; but
now here they are. Good Cause shall the <hi>LORD</hi> have to
Clap <hi>Christ</hi>'s Head that Day: And judge ye if ye will have
a Blyth Heart, to hear <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his Father</hi> to Compt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when we shall be all standing under the broad Scarlet Robe
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Righteousness, and as many Glorified Angels look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And every Souldier that Day shall shew his Wounds to
his <hi>LORD,</hi> saying, <hi>LORD,</hi> I have losed this and this for
<hi>Thee,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> shall clap our Head, and take us benn to <hi>his</hi>
Chamber of Presence, all Glorious Tapestry there, <hi>LORD,</hi>
make you Ready for that Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Shaddow flee away,</hi> or Mist. This Life is all but
a Night, because of the Ignorance and Darkness of our Mind;
We see but the Portrait of the Kingdom in the Glass of the
<hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Then when that Day Dawns, we
shall see <hi>Him</hi> Face to Face. So long as the Night is, we do No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but by the use of Candle; When the Sun rises, the Candle
is blown out, lest we should burn Day-light. The <hi>Gospel</hi> is
GODs <hi>Candle</hi> to let us see the Way to Heaven: But when it
is Day-light, and <hi>Christ</hi> Lighted to us from Heaven, then shall
come Light and Heat from <hi>Him,</hi> Clear Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that shall endure for ever. Our Soul here is like a House
in the Night, when Doors and Windows are closed. In that
Day the Doors and Windows shall cast up, that the Sun may
shine for ever upon us: We shall not need to seek <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
The <hi>Lamb</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> shall be present with you for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
Rev. 21. <hi>I saw no Temple there, for the Lord God
Almighty is their Light.</hi> We get but here the Parings of
GODs Bread, and a Four Hours Drink, to speak so. There
the Board shall be Covered, and the Great Loaf set upon it, and
all shall Eat, and all be Welcome, and the Table shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40089:15"/>
be Drawn. Ye shall have your fill of <hi>CHRIST;</hi> Ye shall
Drink, and Drink at the Wells Head, the <hi>Cup of Salvation</hi>
for evermore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> One Night here: But we know not what we are,
Marches are not redd betwixt <hi>GOD</hi> and Satan here: We
are but Silly Bodies here, Earthen Vessels often in Trouble, I
<hi>Corinthians</hi> 1. and yet Kings Sons, 1 John 3. 2. <hi>Behold now
we are the Sons of GOD, and it doth not yet appear what
we shall be: but we know that when He doth appear, we
shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</hi> A Friend
from a Foe cannot be known in the Night: Care not what the
World think of you, it is Night, they cannot well see you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is Night, because of Great Trouble which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets
us, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 1, 2: Let us be content with an hard Bed,
the Morn will be a Good Day, and think ye what a Comfort
it will be to you, when <hi>GOD</hi> puts up <hi>his</hi> own Holy Hands
to your Face, and to your Watry Eyes, and shall Dry them
with the Napkin of <hi>his</hi> Consolation.</p>
            <p>Now this Short Night ly still in Peace and Sleep by Faith in
<hi>GOD.</hi> Be content to ly down in your Grave for a Night or
Two; for your Husband <hi>Christ</hi> shall be at your Bed-side soon
in the Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turn My Beloved, and be thou like a Roe or a Young
Hart upon the Mountains of Bether.</hi> As <hi>Psalms</hi> 71. 21.
Thou did turn about and comfort me. Turn about and come
to me, as swiftly as a Roe or a Young Hart upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Bether,</hi> or <hi>Bithven.</hi> The Mountains of Division or
Separation: Mount <hi>Gilead</hi> severed or parted from the rest of
the Land of Judea by the River of Jordan. In the which
Mountains, there was Pleasant Hanting; here She Desires <hi>his</hi>
Presence, either in the Last Judgement, or in <hi>his</hi> Incarnation,
or by the Comfort of <hi>his</hi> Holy Spirit, and prays that <hi>he</hi> as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40089:15"/>
Roes and Harts are not Hindered any Whit by any Craigs
or Down-falls of the Rocks to Descend and Meet one with
another. So <hi>CHRIST</hi> would be Kind to <hi>His</hi> Love, and
count Mountains as Valleys, and let no Craigie-way Hinder
the <hi>LORD JESVS</hi> to come. She can never get Her Fill of
<hi>CHRIST;</hi> She is so Browden on <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that She ever
would be at an Union with <hi>him;</hi> There is Kissing, <hi>Verse</hi> 7.
The Place where <hi>he</hi> Dwells, <hi>Chapter</hi> 2. under <hi>his</hi> Shaddow
in <hi>his</hi> Wine-Celler; We cannot be far enough on in going to
<hi>CHRIST:</hi> We can never be near enough hand <hi>him.</hi> Cry ye
to <hi>him,</hi> come; For <hi>he</hi> crys to you, come; and then ye will
Meet. Ill-Gate will not Hinder our Bridegroom to come, <hi>he</hi>
cares not for a Showre of Rain, or a Dark Night. He Loups
over Hills to be at <hi>his</hi> Kirk. Give ye <hi>him</hi> a Meeting. <hi>Amen.</hi>
