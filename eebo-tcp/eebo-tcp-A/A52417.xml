            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE greatneſs of your <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Perſonal worth,</hi> conſider'd with that <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Relation</hi> which has further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd you to us, gives you ſo juſt a Title to theſe Performances, that I could not without an hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Alienation</hi> devote them to any other Patron.

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>OF all the <hi>tedious</hi> things in the world I was ever the leaſt Friend to <hi>long Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces,</hi> and therefore I ſhall only commend to your hands this Collection of <hi>Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies</hi> occaſionally compoſed at ſeveral times, as my <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Leaſure</hi> ſerv'd me, with a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my <hi>Deſign</hi> as to <hi>both Parts</hi> of the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to trouble you with a <hi>Pompous</hi> diſcourſe of the nature of <hi>Poetry,</hi> its Meaſures of Criticiſm, its Variety, Antiquity, its great uſe and excellence and the like, which have been at large ſet forth by many curious Pens, I have only leaſure at preſent to obſerve, that Poetry is of late mightily fall'n from the Beauty of its <hi>Idea,</hi> and from its ancient <hi>Majeſty</hi> and grandeur, as well as <hi>Credit</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                  <p>It may appear ſtrange indeed that in ſuch a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining</hi> Age as this, wherein all things ſeem ready to receive their <hi>laſt turn</hi> and <hi>finiſhing ſtroke,</hi> Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould be the only thing that remains unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd. And yet ſo it happens, that which we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have now adays is no more like the thing it was formerly, than <hi>Modern Religion</hi> is like <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis with this as with our <hi>Muſic.</hi> From grave, majeſtic, ſolemn ſtrains, where deep inſtructive ſenſe
<pb facs="tcp:95868:5"/>
is ſweetly convey'd in charming numbers, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual addreſs is made to the <hi>Judgment</hi> and the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and where <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> go hand in hand, 'tis now for the moſt part dwindled down to light, frothy ſtuff, conſiſting either of mad extravagant Rants, or ſlight <hi>Witticiſms,</hi> and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle amorous <hi>Conceits,</hi> fit only for a <hi>Tavern enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,</hi> and that too among Readers of a <hi>Dutch</hi> palate.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, this moſt excellent and Divine Art has of late been ſo <hi>cheapned</hi> and depretiated by the <hi>bungling</hi> performances of ſome who thought themſelves <hi>inſpired,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Readers</hi> too have been more kind to them than their <hi>Planets,</hi> that <hi>Poetry</hi> is grown almoſt out of <hi>Repute,</hi> and men come ſtrongly prejudiced againſt any thing of this kind, as expecting nothing but <hi>Froth</hi> and <hi>Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and to be a <hi>Poet</hi> goes for little more than a <hi>Country Fidler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But certainly he had once <hi>another Character,</hi> and that in as <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> an Age as this. If we may believe the great <hi>Horace</hi> he was one</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>——Cui mens Divinior, atque Os</l>
                     <l>Magna locuturum————</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>He had then his <hi>Temples</hi> ſurrounded with a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory,</hi> ſpoke like the <hi>Oracle</hi> of the God of <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and could deſcribe no Hero greater than <hi>himſelf.</hi> Poetry was once the <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of all the Arts in the <hi>Circle,</hi> that which held the <hi>Rains</hi> of the world in her hand, and which gave the <hi>firſt,</hi> and (if we may judge by the effects) perhaps the <hi>beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes</hi> for the moralizing and governing the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of mankind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95868:5"/>The Deſign therefore of the preſent undertaking is to reſtore the <hi>declining</hi> genius of Poetry to its <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>genuin</hi> greatneſs, to wind up the <hi>ſtrings</hi> of the <hi>Muſes Lyre,</hi> and to ſhew that <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>gracefulneſs</hi> are as conſiſtent in theſe as in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Compoſitions. I deſign here all the <hi>Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſenſe</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> of a <hi>Diſſertation,</hi> with the advantage of <hi>Poetic Fineneſs,</hi> Beauty and Spirit, and accordingly I have made choice for the moſt part of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Subjects, and if I meddle with any other ſort, I commonly turn the <hi>ſtream</hi> another way, as particularly in thoſe two <hi>Poems</hi> call'd <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which I have <hi>reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued</hi> from thoſe ſordid abuſes they have hitherto ſuffer'd.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs 'tis a difficult Province to make <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial maſſy</hi> Senſe yield to the <hi>ſoftneſſes of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and accordingly we find there are few Poems after the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> way but what are ſtiff, flat and inſipid; but without this <hi>Mixture</hi> Poetry is nothing worth, and when it has it, it has all it <hi>can</hi> have, and is withall ſo <hi>Divine</hi> a thing, that even <hi>Plato</hi> I fancy would give it entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>his Common-wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not make any <hi>other Apology</hi> for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the <hi>Muſes,</hi> for I do not think it an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment beneath the Character of a <hi>Scholar,</hi> and tho I have now ſet up my <hi>outmoſt Pillar,</hi> yet I can't find in my heart to repent me of thoſe <hi>few Blank hours</hi> beſtow'd in this Exerciſe. For I have the example of ſome of the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>wiſeſt</hi> in all Ages to warrant me, and the greatneſs of <hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:95868:6"/>
is ſeen as much in his <hi>Divine Paſtoral,</hi> the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> as in his <hi>Proverbs</hi> or <hi>Sermons,</hi> and the wiſe <hi>Ben-Sirach</hi> among other Characters of his <hi>Heroes</hi> puts in this among the reſt, that they were <hi>ſuch as found out Muſical tunes, and recited Verſes in writing.</hi> Eccl. 44. 5.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the <hi>Verſe-part.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Eſſays</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> I have only this to ſay, that I deſign'd in them as much <hi>Brevity</hi> and <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> as are conſiſtent with each other, and to abound in <hi>ſenſe</hi> rather than <hi>words.</hi> I wiſh all men would obſerve this in their writings more than they do. I'm ſure the <hi>multitude of Books</hi> and the <hi>ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life</hi> require it, and ſenſe will lye in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle compaſs if men would be perſwaded to vent no Notions but what they are <hi>Maſters</hi> of, and were <hi>Angels</hi> to write, I fancy we ſhould have but few <hi>Folio's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is what I <hi>deſign'd</hi> and <hi>endeavour'd</hi> in the <hi>whole.</hi> Whether I have <hi>attain'd</hi> it or no, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Judgment.</hi>

                        <p>It is highly reaſonable to believe that thoſe bleſſed and excellent Spirits, who out of their compaſſionate love and concern for mankind, uſher'd in the news of our Saviour's Nativity with <hi>Anthems</hi> of <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving;</hi> and are ſaid likewiſe to <hi>rejoice</hi> at the Converſion of a Sinner, were alſo mightily tranſported with joy, when they underſtood that our Saviour, notwithſtanding the <hi>reluctancy</hi> of <hi>innocent</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was at length fully reſolv'd to undertake the <hi>Price</hi> of our Redemption.</p>

                        <p>It is ſuppoſed by the Ancient Fathers, that the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95868:12"/>
Sufferings which our B. Saviour underwent in his Body, were more afflictive to him than the ſame would have been to another man, upon the account of the excellency and quickneſs of his ſenſe of feeling: And this opinion I take to be as <hi>reaſonable,</hi> as 'tis <hi>pious.</hi> For ſince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles of Philoſophy, the ſenſe of feeling ariſes from the proportion of the firſt Qualities, it follows, that the better the complexion or temperament of any man is, the better his Feeling muſt needs be. Now 'tis very reaſonable to believe, that that man who was to be ſubſtantially united to the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> and who was begotten by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>overſhadowings</hi> of the holy Spirit, ſhould have a Body endow'd with the beſt Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, and moſt noble <hi>Harmony</hi> of Qualities that could be, that ſo it might be a ſuitable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan for his excellent Soul. And if ſo, then it follows that the fleſh of our Lord's Body was ſo ſoft and render, and his feeling ſo exquiſitely quick and ſenſible, as never any man's was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And conſequently the ſevere uſages which he underwent, not only at his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> but throughout his <hi>whole</hi> Life, muſt needs be in a <hi>Singular</hi> manner afflictive to him. And hence appears the vanity of their opinion, who are little or nothing affected with the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lords Paſſion, becauſe they think it was made light to him, by reaſon of his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>God-head.</hi> 'Twas eaſie for him (ſome
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95868:13"/>
inconſiderate Perſons are ready to ſay) to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this or this, for he was God, and not meer man, as we are. True, he was ſo, but his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God did no way leſſen the puniſhment he underwent as <hi>man,</hi> but only ſupported him in his <hi>exiſtence</hi> under it, in the ſame manner as God is ſuppoſed, by an act of his Almighty Power, to preſerve the bodies of the <hi>Damn'd, incorruptible</hi> among the <hi>everlaſting burnings.</hi> But this I think is no <hi>kindneſs</hi> to them. Neither did the Society of the Divine Nature any more diminiſh the Sufferings of our deareſt Lord; nay, in one reſpect it proved an <hi>accidental ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> to them, becauſe upon the account of this Noble Union he had given him a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a moſt admirable Complexion and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Temperature, and conſequently of a Fleſh exceeding tender, and moſt exquiſitely perceptive of the leaſt impreſſions.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Eclipſe</hi> which accompany'd the Paſſion of our Saviour was ſo remarkable and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, that 'twas taken notice of by many of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Hiſtorians. There are three things which made this Eclipſe ſo very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, the time of its <hi>Appearance,</hi> the time of its <hi>Duration,</hi> and the <hi>Degree</hi> of it. 1. For the time of its Appearance, it was at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95868:13"/>
                           <hi>full Moon,</hi> when the Moon was not in <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> with, but in oppoſition to the Sun. And this appears not only from the teſtimony. of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who affirms that he ſaw it at that time, but alſo from the time of our Lord's <hi>Paſſion,</hi> which, according to the relation of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt,</hi> was at the Celebration of the <hi>Paſſeover.</hi> Now the <hi>Iews</hi> were bound to celebrate the <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> Solemnity always at full Moon, as is to be ſeen in the twelfth of <hi>Exodus.</hi> This was no time therefore for a <hi>Natural</hi> Eclipſe, becauſe 'twas impoſſible that the Moon ſhould then inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe betwixt us and the Sun. 2. For the time of its <hi>Duration,</hi> it was full three hours, which is another evidence that this was no <hi>Natural</hi> Eclipſe: For the <hi>Natural</hi> Eclipſe of the Sun can never laſt ſo long, both becauſe of the great diſproportion between the Suns Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and that of the Moon, and becauſe of the ſwift motion of the <hi>latter.</hi> 3. For the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> of it, it was a <hi>total</hi> Eclipſe. The Sun was ſo darkned, that (as Hiſtorians report, who write of that Eclipſe) the <hi>Stars</hi> appear'd. And this is another Argument that it was no <hi>Natural Phoenomenon,</hi> it being impoſſible that the Body of the Moon, which is ſo infinitely leſs than that of the Sun, ſhould <hi>totally</hi> eclipſe it. Now all theſe three Remarkables are comprized in the compaſs of theſe two Verſes. For in that it is ſaid that the <hi>Sun withdrew his light,</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that the light of the Sun was not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted</hi>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95868:14"/>
by the ordinary <hi>conjunction</hi> of the Moon, but that by an Extraordinary <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the God of Nature, the Sun <hi>rein'd</hi> in his light, and <hi>ſuſpended</hi> the emiſſion of his Beams. And this denotes the time of its <hi>appearance, (viz.)</hi> when the Moon was not in <hi>Conjunction.</hi> The time of its <hi>duration</hi> is implied by the words, <hi>So long.</hi> And laſtly, the <hi>Degree</hi> of it is implied in the laſt Verſe,</p>
                        <q>And wonder'd how the Stars their dying Lord could view.</q>
                        <p>Where the appearance of the Stars is not <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> expreſs'd, but only <hi>inſinuated</hi> and <hi>couch'd,</hi> for the more elegancy of the thought.</p>
                        <q>And calm the Relicts of his grief with Hymns divine.</q>
                        <p>It is here ſuppoſed that the Paſſion of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was now over, and his Father's wrath wholly appeas'd. For I can by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the opinion of thoſe who fancy that our Saviour, in the interim betwixt his Death and Reſurrection, deſcended <hi>locally</hi> into Hell, there to ſuffer the torments of the damn'd. His own words upon the Croſs, <hi>It is finiſh'd;</hi> His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the penitent Thief, that he ſhould be with him that day in <hi>Paradice,</hi> and his laſt <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation</hi> of his Spirit into the hands of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do all of them apparently contradict it. But yet, though the <hi>bitter Cup</hi> was wholly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95868:14"/>
drank off upon the Croſs, 'tis natural to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſome little <hi>reliſh</hi> of it to remain behind for a time. Though all his ſufferings and <hi>penal</hi> inflictions were ended before his death, yet, I ſuppoſe (and I think very naturally) ſome little <hi>diſcompoſures</hi> of mind, remaining like the <hi>after-droppings</hi> of a ſhower, which his Soul could not immediately ſhake off, upon her releaſe from the Body. In alluſion to that of <hi>Virgil,</hi>

                        <p>And here I cannot chuſe but take notice of a Difficulty which is very incident to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in hand, and wherewith I my ſelf was once very much perplex'd when I firſt applyed my thoughts to Moral Contemplations. 'Tis in ſhort this, we have a receiv'd Axiom that the Difficulty of the performance Commends the merit of a good Action. Now if ſo, it ſeems to follow that he who by a long habitual courſe of Piety and Vertue has made his duty eaſy
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95868:36"/>
and natural to himſelf, will be leſs perfect than another who does hardly abſtain from vice, or than himſelf before the acquiſition of that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. And then that <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the 7th of his Ethics makes only a <hi>Semi-vertue</hi> becauſe of the difficulty of its performance, will for that very reaſon become <hi>Virtus Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and if ſo, to make a progreſs in vertue will involve a contradiction. This I confeſs appear'd to me no inconſiderable intricacy when it firſt occurr'd to my thoughts, and I could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>unwind</hi> my ſelf from it.</p>
                        <p>But in anſwer to it I conſider, I. That when the Difficulty of the performance is ſayd to commend the Action, 'tis not ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as if Difficulty did in it ſelf as an ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient add any moment to the excellency of a mans vertue, but only that 'tis a ſign of it a <hi>Poſteriori.</hi> Becauſe were not a man endow'd with ſuch a degree of vertue he would not be able to conquer the ſuppos'd Difficulty. So that if a man has a ſtock of Reſolution ſufficient to conquer ſuch a difficulty, his vertue is the ſame tho he never be ingaged in it. For all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is abſolv'd in the degree of reſolution, the difficulty is only a ſign or indication of it. And upon this conſideration 'tis that thoſe whom nature has befriended with ſuch an <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or happy conſtitution as carries with it little or no temptation to vice may yet be accounted ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, becauſe their Reſolution to vertue may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95868:36"/>
be ſo firm and peremptory, that they would adhere to it notwithſtanding any Oppoſition.</p>
                        <p>2ly. I conſider that we are to diſtinguiſh of a twofold difficulty. I. There is a difficulty which ariſes from the nature of the work it ſelf. And 2ly there is a Difficulty which ariſes from the Diſpoſition of the Agent. Now 'tis not this latter Difficulty that commends the excellency of vertue, but only the former, which is no way diminiſh'd by the habit. For after the induction of the habit the work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame in its own nature which it was before, the only change is in the Agent, who by his habit is render'd more expedite and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the performance of what is good. But as for the latter difficulty which proceeds from the Agent himſelf, that is ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the worth of any good action, that it derogates much from its commendation. 'Tis eaſineſs of performance that here gives the value. He that abſtains from ſenſual pleaſures with great abhorrency, and has ſet himſelf at a wide diſtance from it, diſcovers more and has more of a vertuous reſolution than he whoſe mind ſtands almoſt in an equipoiſe, and does but juſt abſtain. For ſince we become vertuous by a right application of our wills, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our vertues muſt be meaſured by the greater or leſs ſtrength of our reſolutions. And conſequently he who by a ſtrong habit has made his vertue moſt natural and eaſy to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95868:37"/>
him is arrived to the greateſt Perfection.</p>

                     <head>Of the advantages of Thinking.</head>
                     <p>MAN being the only Creature here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low deſign'd for a ſociable life, has two facultys to diſtinguiſh him from other Créatures, <hi>Thinking</hi> and <hi>Speaking.</hi> The one, to fit him for the ſociety of others; and the other, to qualify him alſo for his own. As to the latter of theſe Facultys, there's no fear of its gathering ruſt for want of uſe. We are rather apt to ſpeak too much; and the moſt Reſerv'd have reaſon to pray with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Set a watch O Lord before my mouth, and keep the door of my lips.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the former, is that which generally lies <hi>fallow</hi> and neglected; as may be gueſs'd from the intemperate uſe of the other. There are few indeed, that are <hi>capable</hi> of thinking to any great purpoſe: but among thoſe that <hi>are,</hi> there are fewer that <hi>employ</hi> this excellent Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. And for ought I know, however ſtrange it may ſeem, among the Ingenious and well educated there are as few <hi>Thinkers</hi> as among the Herd of the vulgar and illiterate. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live a <hi>Popular</hi> life; and then what for buſineſs, pleaſures, Company, viſits, with a world of other impertinencys, there's ſcarce
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95868:80"/>
room for ſo much as a Morning reflexion. Or elſe, they live <hi>retir'd,</hi> and then either they doze away their time in drowſineſs and brown ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys; or, if brisk and active, they lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out wholely upon devouring books and making Common places, and ſcarce entertain their Solitude with a Meditation once in a Moon.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis merely for want of Thinking that they can allow themſelves in doing ſo. For by a little of this, they would ſoon diſcover that of all the Methods of improvement that can be uſed, there is none ſo advantagious as Thinking; either for our Intellectuals or our Morals; to make us wiſer, or to make us better. And firſt, for our Intellectuals. 'Tis the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Rational part to <hi>know;</hi> that is, to be able to frame clear and diſtinct conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, to form right Judgments, and to draw true conſequences from one thing to another. Now beſides that the Powers of the mind are made more bright, vigorous, and active by uſe, as all other facultys are; there is this further advantage, that by habitual thinking the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is made more familiar to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Habitudes and relations of Ideas one towards another, by frequent comparing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more viſible and apparent; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, 'tis more eaſy to divide what ought to be divided, and to compound what ought to be compounded; wherein conſiſts the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95868:80"/>
ſum of all <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Science.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reading</hi> is indeed very excellent and <hi>uſeful</hi> to this purpoſe; but Thinking is <hi>neceſſary.</hi> This may do without the other, as appears in the firſt Inventors of Arts and Sciences; who were fain to think out their way to the Receſſes of Truth; but the other can never do, without this. Reading without thinking, may indeed make a rich <hi>Common place,</hi> but twill never make a rich <hi>head;</hi> it may, indeed, bring in a great ſtore of <hi>Hyle,</hi> but 'tis yet <hi>without form</hi> and <hi>void,</hi> till Thinking, like the Seminal ſpirit, agitates the dead ſhapeleſs lump, and works it up into figure and ſymmetry.</p>
                     <p>But of what advantage Thinking is to the advancement of Knowledge, will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by conſidering ſome of the chief impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it; and how they are removed by Thinking. And the firſt that I ſhall mention, is the Prejudice of Infancy. We form infinite raſh judgments of things, before we duly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any thing; and theſe grow up with us, take root, ſpread and multiply; till, after long uſe and cuſtom, we miſtake them for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions and dictates of nature; and then we think it a crime to go about to unlearn or eradicate them. And as long as we ſtand thus affected, we are condemn'd to errours and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual wandrings. So great reaſon had the excellent <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> to lay the foundation of his Philoſophy in an <hi>Equipoiſe</hi> of mind; and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95868:81"/>
to make the removal of theſe Prejudices the very entrance and beginning of wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>But now when a man ſets upon a courſe of Thinking, nothing will be ſo obvious as to conſider, that ſince we come ſo late to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect uſe of our reaſon; among thoſe many judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have made, 'tis very likely the major part are falſe and erroneous. And this is a fair ſtep to the ſhaking off thoſe infant-Prejudices; at leaſt he will be thereby induc'd not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing the rather, becauſe he had given it ſuch early entertainment. From this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reflexion he proceeds to examin the things themſelves. And <hi>now</hi> he is a capable Judge, can hear both ſides with an indifferent ear, is determin'd only by the moments of truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo retracts his <hi>paſt</hi> errours, and has the beſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſecurity againſt any for the <hi>future.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another great hindrance to knowledg is the wrong <hi>perception</hi> of things. When the ſimple Ideas of our minds are confus'd, our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can never proceed without errour. 'Tis like a fault in the firſt concoction, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corrected in either of the other. For how can I judge whether the Attribute agree to the ſubject, it my notion of both be <hi>confus'd</hi> and <hi>obſcure?</hi> But now, the only cauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedneſs of our notions, next to the natural inability of our faculties, is want of <hi>Attention</hi> and cloſe <hi>application</hi> of mind. We don't <hi>dwell</hi> enough upon the object; but ſpeculate it tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95868:81"/>
and in haſt; and then, no wonder that we conceive it by halves. Thinking therefore is a proper Remedy for this defect alſo.</p>
                     <p>Another great hindrance to knowledg is <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of Terms and Phraſes.</hi> This has bred a world of confuſion and miſunderſtanding, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in controverſys of Religion; a great many of which, if thoroughly ſifted and well compared, will be found to be mere <hi>verbal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. As may appear from what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Monſieur <hi>Le Blanc</hi> has perform'd in this kind. But now, this is owing merely to want of thinking. There is a latitude in the Phraſe; and one writer not ſufficiently attending to that determinate ſenſe of it which his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary intends, very haſtily and furiouſly denys what the other does not affirm; and he again as furiouſly affirms what this does not deny. So that they are really agreed all along, and yet fight on like Fools in the dark. And there is no hopes they will ever be reconciled, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will take the pains to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſome body elſe will be ſo kind, as to think for 'em.</p>
                     <p>Another great hindrance to knowledg is an <hi>over-fond</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious deference to Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> eſpecially that of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that cramps the Parts, and fetters the underſtandings of men like this ſtrait-lac'd hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Men are reſolv'd never to outſhoot their forefathers mark; but write one after another,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95868:82"/>
and ſo the dance goes round in a circle; and the world is never the <hi>wiſer</hi> for being <hi>older.</hi> Take an inſtance of this in the <hi>School-men,</hi> and in the beſt of them, <hi>Aquinas.</hi> 'Tis pleaſant to ſee how that great Wit is oftentimes put to't to maintain ſome unlucky Authorities, for the ſalving of which he is forced to ſuch ſhifts and expedients which he muſt needs (ſhould he dare to think freely) ſee through and diſcern to be falſe; and yet ſuch a ſlave was he, that he would rather loſe truth, than go out of the Road to find it. This alſo makes men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſenſeful and Ingenious, quote ſuch things many times out of an old dull Author, and with a peculiar emphaſis of commendation too, as would never paſs even in ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and which they themſelves would never have took notice of, had not ſuch an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſaid it. But now, no ſooner does a man give himſelf leave to think, but he perceives how abuſurd and unreaſonable 'tis, that one man ſhould preſcribe to all Poſterity: that men, like beaſts, ſhould follow the foremoſt of the Herd; and that venerable <hi>non-ſenſe</hi> ſhould be prefer'd before <hi>new-ſenſe:</hi> He conſiders, that that which we call <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is properly the nonage of the world; that the ſageſt of his Authoritys were once new; and that there is no other difference between an antient Author and himſelf, but only that of time; which, if of any advantage, 'tis rather on his ſide, as living in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95868:82"/>
and mature age of the world. And thus having caſt off this <hi>Intellectual</hi> ſlavery, like one of the brave <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> mention'd by <hi>Laertius,</hi> he addicts himſelf to no Author, Sect or Party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but freely picks up Truth where-ever he can find it; puts to Sea upon his own bottom; holds the Stern himſelf; and now, if ever, we may expect new diſcoverys.</p>
                     <p>There are other notable impediments to the improvement of knowledg, ſuch as Paſſion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, fear of being tax'd with inconſtancy, ſcorn of being inform'd by another, Envy, the humour of Contradiction, and ſometimes Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in applauding every thing we hear, and the like. Now as to the manner how all theſe are remov'd by thinking, it may ſuffice to ſav in general, that they are all obviouſly abſurd and ridiculous; and however unthinking men may be abuſed by them, yet a free and cloſe Thinker muſt needs quickly perceive that they are ſo: and there is no better Moral way that I know of to be quit of ill habits, than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinc'd of their Folly and Miſchief.</p>
                     <p>But the greateſt advantage of thinking is yet behind, that it improves our Morals as well as our Intellectuals; and ſerves to make us Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as well as Wiſer. This is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure included in the other. All therefore that I ſhall further remark concerning it is this, that conſidering the great influence the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding has upon the will, there are but two
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95868:83"/>
things neceſſary to preſerve us in our duty. Firſt an habitual Theory of what we ought and ought not to do; and of all the motives and engagements to the one and to the other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly an actual and clear preſence of all this to the mind, in every Inſtant of action. And this is for the moſt part the thinking man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. He does not only Habitually <hi>know,</hi> but actually <hi>attends</hi> both to his Duty, and to all the engagements for its performance. He has thoſe Conſiderations almoſt always preſent with him which to others are the Principles of <hi>Repentance;</hi> and this keeps him <hi>in</hi> his Duty, which brings others <hi>to</hi> it; and makes him live like thoſe <hi>Righteous</hi> perſons of whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſays, that they <hi>need no Repentance.</hi>

                     <head>Of the Care and Improvement of Time.</head>
                     <p>TO be careful how we manage and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our Time, is one of the <hi>firſt</hi> Precepts that is <hi>taught</hi> in the School of Wiſdom, and one of the <hi>laſt</hi> that is <hi>learn'd.</hi> The firſt and <hi>leading</hi> dictate of Prudence is, That a Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to himſelf his true and beſt intereſt for his End; and the next is, That he make uſe of all thoſe means and opportunities whereby that end is to be attain'd. And betwixt theſe two there is ſuch a cloſe connexion, that he who does not <hi>do</hi> the <hi>latter,</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to <hi>intend</hi> the <hi>former.</hi> He that is not careful of his actions, ſhall never perſwade me that he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly propoſes to himſelf his beſt intereſt, as his <hi>end,</hi> for if he did, he would as ſeriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to the regulation of the <hi>other</hi> as the <hi>means.</hi> And ſo he that is not careful of his Time, cannot in reaſon be ſuppoſed to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Actions; for if he were, he would certainly have a ſpecial regard to the <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of their performance.</p>
                     <p>But, as I obſerv'd in the beginning, though this Precept be one of the <hi>Elementary</hi> dictates of Prudence, and ſtands written in the <hi>firſt page</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:95868:84"/>
of the <hi>Book of Wiſdom;</hi> yet ſuch is the ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtupidity of the World, that there is none that is more <hi>ſlowly learn'd.</hi> And 'tis a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious thing to conſider, that, although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the <hi>Talents</hi> which are committed to our <hi>Stewardſhip,</hi> Time upon ſeveral accounts is the moſt precious, yet there is not any one of which the generality of men are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and regardleſs. Tho it be a thing of that ineſtimable value, that 'tis not diſtributed to us <hi>intirely,</hi> and at once, like other Bleſſings, but is <hi>dealt</hi> out in minutes and little parcels, as if man were not fit to be truſted with the <hi>intire</hi> poſſeſſion of ſuch a <hi>choice</hi> Treaſure, yet there are very many that think themſelves ſo <hi>overſtock'd</hi> with it, that inſtead of <hi>husbanding</hi> it to advantage, the main buſineſs of their thoughts is how to rid their hands of it, and accordingly they catch at every ſhadow and opportunity of <hi>relief;</hi> ſtrike in at a venture with the next Companion, and ſo the <hi>dead Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity</hi> be <hi>taken off,</hi> care not who be the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Nay, 'tis obvious to obſerve, that even thoſe perſons who are frugal and thrifty in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing elſe, are yet extremely prodigal of their beſt <hi>Revenue,</hi> Time; <hi>Of which alone</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> neatly obſerves) <hi>'tis a Vertue to be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous.</hi>

And this they are ſo far from being aſhamed to own, that they freely boaſt of it, and pride themſelves in it, thinking that it tends to their Reputation, and commends the greatneſs of their Parts, that they can <hi>ſupport</hi> themſelves upon the Natural <hi>ſtock,</hi> without being beholden to the <hi>Intereſt</hi> that is brought in by Study and Induſtry.</p>
                     <p>But if their Parts be ſo good as they would have others believe, ſure they are <hi>worth</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving; if not, they have the more <hi>need</hi> of it.

Greatneſs of Parts is ſo far from being a diſcharge from <hi>Induſtry,</hi> that I find Men of the moſt exquiſite Senſe in all Ages were always moſt curious of their Time: Nay, the moſt Intelligent of all Created Beings (who may be allow'd to paſs a truer eſtimate upon things than the fineſt

                     <p>IT has been urg'd as an Objection, by ſome <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> Perſons, againſt the exiſtence of a God, that if there had been ſuch a perfect Being, who was <hi>compleatly</hi> happy in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, he would never have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make a World. Now, tho this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction contributes nothing to the ſupport of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm (the deſign of God in Creating the World being not to <hi>increaſe</hi> his happineſs, but to <hi>Communicate</hi> it) yet it proceeds upon this true ſuppoſition, That <hi>Society</hi> is a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> It is ſo, and that not only <hi>reſpectively,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the preſent circumſtances of the World, and the Neceſſities of this Life, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>ſimply,</hi> and in its own Nature; ſince it ſhall be an <hi>Acceſſory</hi> to our bliſs in Heaven, and add many <hi>moments</hi> to the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi> Neither will the truth of this aſſertion be at all weaken'd by alledging that no benefit or advantage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to God by it, for that it becomes unbene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to him (tho a Bleſſing in its own nature) is purely by accident, becauſe God eminently containing in himſelf all <hi>poſſible</hi> good, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any <hi>New</hi> Acceſſion.</p>
                     <p>And as Society is in its own nature an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Happineſs, ſo is it made much more ſo
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95868:86"/>
by the indigencies and infirmities of Men. Man, of all Creatures in the World, is leaſt qualify'd to live alone, becauſe there is no Creature that has ſo many neceſſities to be reliev'd. And this I take to be one of the great <hi>Arts</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to ſecure mutual amity and the <hi>reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procation</hi> of good turns in the World, it being the Nature of Indigency, like common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to indear men to one another, and make them herd together, like <hi>Fellow-Sailors</hi> in a <hi>Storm.</hi> And this indeed is the true caſe of Mankind, we all Sail in one <hi>bottom,</hi> and in a <hi>rough</hi> Sea, and ſtand in need of one anothers help at every turn, both for the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> and <hi>Refreſhments</hi> of Life. And therefore I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from commending the undertaking of thoſe <hi>Aſcetics,</hi> that our of a pretence of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves <hi>unſpotted from the World,</hi> take up their quarters in <hi>Deſarts,</hi> and utterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all Human Society. This is in ſhort (to ſay no more of it) to put themſelves into an incapacity either of <hi>doing</hi> any good to the World, or of receiving any from it: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that can be no deſirable ſtate. No, this <hi>Eremetical</hi> way of Living is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Circumſtances and Inclinations of Human Nature; he muſt be a God, <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> that is fit for this ſtate of abſolute and perfect Solitude, and in this <hi>rigorous</hi> ſenſe, <hi>It is not good for man</hi> (tho in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice</hi> it ſelf) <hi>to be alone.</hi>

                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:95868:87"/>But tho Society, as 'tis oppoſed to a ſtate of perfect and perpetual Solitude, be a Bleſſing, yet conſidering how little of it there is in the World that is <hi>good,</hi> I think it adviſable for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that has ſenſe and thoughts enough, to be his own Companion, (for certainly there is more required to qualifie a man for his <hi>own</hi> company than for <hi>other</hi> men's) to be as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in his Retirements as he can, and to communicate as little with the World as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the duty of doing good, and the diſcharge of the common offices of Humanity. 'Tis true indeed (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays) <hi>Miſcendae &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternandae ſunt Solitudo &amp; frequentia: Solitude and Company are to have their turns, and to be interplaced.</hi> But Wiſe-men uſe to dedicate the largeſt ſhare of their Lives to the former, and let the <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>moſt</hi> of their Time go to make up the <hi>Canonical Hours</hi> of Study, Meditation and Devotion. And for this, beſides the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Wiſe-men, we have the <hi>Authentic</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our B. Lord himſelf, Who, as 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſuppoſed (for he had paſs'd the thirtieth year of his Life before he enter'd upon the ſtage of Action, and then alſo ſought all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be alone, and oftentimes purchas'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement at the expence of Night-watches) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted the greateſt part of his little Time here on Earth to Privacy and Retirement; and 'tis highly probable, would have liv'd much more reſervedly, had not the peculiar buſineſs of his
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95868:87"/>
function made it neceſſary for him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in the World. The inclination of our Lord lay more toward the <hi>Contemplative</hi> way of Life, tho the intereſt of Mankind engaged him oftentimes upon the <hi>Active.</hi> And 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable, that there is ſcarce any one thing which he vouchſafed to grace with ſo many marks and inſtances of favour and reſpect as he did Solitude. Which are thus ſumm'd up by the excellent Pen of a very great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter<note place="margin">The Great Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar.</note> of Learning and Language; <hi>It was Solitude and Retirement in which Jeſus kept his Vigils; the deſart places heard him pray, in a privacy he was born, in the Wilderneſs he fed his thouſands, upon a Mountain apart he was transfigured, upon a Mountain he died, and from a Mountain he aſcended to his Father. In which Retirements his Devotion certainly did receive the advantage of convenient circumſtances, and himſelf in ſuch diſpoſitions twice had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Indeed, the <hi>Satisfactions</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> of Solitude (to a perſon that knows how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it) are very great, and far tranſcending thoſe of a <hi>Secular</hi> and <hi>Popular</hi> Life. Firſt, as to Pleaſure and Satisfaction, whoſoever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the great variety of mens humours, the peeviſhneſs of ſome, the pride and conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others, and the impertinence of moſt; he that conſiders what unreaſonable <hi>terms of Communion</hi> ſome perſons impoſe upon thoſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95868:88"/>
that partake of their Society; how rare 'tis for a man to light upon a Company, where, as his firſt Salutation, he ſhall not preſently have a Bottle thruſt to his Noſe; he, I ſay, that conſiders theſe and a thouſand more grievances, wherewith the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>ill nature</hi> of men have conſpired to <hi>burthen</hi> Society, will find, take one time with another, Company is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of almoſt as much <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> as <hi>pleaſure.</hi> Whereas in the mean time the Solitary and Contemplative man ſits as ſafe in his Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as one of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Heroes</hi> in a Cloud, and has this only trouble from the follies and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of men, that he <hi>pitties</hi> them. He does not, it may be, laugh ſo loud, but he is better <hi>pleas'd:</hi> He is not perhaps ſo often <hi>merry,</hi> but neither is he ſo often <hi>diſguſted;</hi> he lives to himſelf and God, full of Serenity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                     <p>And as the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Satisfactions</hi> of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude exceed thoſe of a Popular Life, ſo alſo do the <hi>Advantages.</hi> Of theſe there are two ſorts, <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Intellectual;</hi> to both which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is a <hi>particular</hi> friend. As to the firſt, it is plain that Solitude is the proper opportunity of Contemplation, which is both the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and the <hi>Perfection</hi> of a Religious Life. <hi>It is</hi> (as the ſame excellent Perſon forecited ſays elſewhere of a ſingle Life) <hi>the huge advantage of Religion, the great opportunity for the Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Devotion, which being empty of Cares is</hi>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:95868:88"/>
                        <hi>full of Prayers, being unmingled with the World is apt to converſe with God, and by not feeling the warmth of a too forward and indulgent Nature, flames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out with holy Fires, till it be burning like the Cherubim and the moſt extaſy'd Order of holy and unpolluted Spirits.</hi> And for this reaſon 'twas that the Anciente choſe to build their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars and Temples in Groves and Solitary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, thereby intimating<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Solitude was the beſt opportunity of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Neither are our <hi>intellectual</hi> advantages leſs indebted to Solitude. And here, tho I have in a great meaſure anticipated this conſideration (there being nothing neceſſarily required to compleat the Character of a Wiſe-man, beſides the knowledg of God and himſelf) yet I ſhall not confine my ſelf to this inſtance, but deduce the matter further, and venture to affirm that all kinds of <hi>Speculative</hi> knowledg as well as <hi>practical,</hi> are beſt improved by Solitude. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is much talk about the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of keeping Great men company, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon 'tis uſually reckon'd among the <hi>diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> of a <hi>Country</hi> life, that thoſe of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition want the opportunities of a <hi>Learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</hi> But to confeſs the truth, I think there is not ſo much in it as people generally imagine. Indeed, were the Souls of men lodg'd in <hi>tranſparent caſes,</hi> that we might read their thoughts; would they <hi>communicate</hi> what they know, were it the faſhion to diſcourſe learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95868:89"/>
'twere worth while to frequent the <hi>Cabals</hi> of Great men: But when it ſhall be counted a piece of <hi>errant Pedantry,</hi> and defect of good breeding to ſtart any Queſtion of Learning in Company; when every man is as ſhy of his Notions as of a <hi>Fairy-treaſure;</hi> and makes his Head not a Repoſitory or <hi>Exchequer</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but a <hi>Grave</hi> to bury it in: A man may be a conſtant attendant at the <hi>Conclaves</hi> of Learned men all his life long, and yet be no more the wiſer for't than a <hi>Book-worm</hi> is for dwelling in <hi>Libraries.</hi> And therefore, to ſpeak ingeniouſly, I don't ſee for my part wherein the great advantage of great Converſation lies, as the humours of men are pleas'd to order it. Were I to inform my ſelf in buſineſs, and the management of affairs, I would ſooner talk with a plain illiterate Farmer or Trades-man than the greateſt <hi>Vertuoſo</hi> of <hi>The Society;</hi> and as for Learning (which is the only thing they are ſuppoſed able to diſcourſe well of) <hi>that</hi> in point of <hi>Civility</hi> they decline: So that I find I muſt take refuge at my Study at laſt, and there <hi>redeem</hi> the Time that I have <hi>loſt</hi> among the <hi>Learned.</hi>

                     <p>A <hi>Riſtotle</hi> in his Morals begins the Doctrine of Vertues with <hi>Courage;</hi> which has found work for his Interpreters to aſſign the reaſon of his method. But, methinks, there is no great need they ſhould either <hi>ſtudy</hi> or <hi>differ</hi> much about it. For certainly, among all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues this will juſtly challenge the <hi>Precedency,</hi> and is the moſt <hi>Cardinal</hi> and fundamental part of Morality. This Vertue is pre-required to the <hi>ſuſception</hi> of all the reſt. For the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the School of wiſdom and a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous courſe is a ſtate of Diſcipline, Difficulty and Hardſhip. And therefore 'tis <hi>ſapere aude,</hi> a great piece of <hi>daring</hi> and boldneſs to ſet up for a good man: eſpecially, if to the proper difficulties and Agonies of a Vertuous engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we add thoſe calamities and ſtraits it oftentimes expoſes us to, through the malice and folly of the world. So that as <hi>Plato</hi> writ upon his School <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>And as 'tis neceſſarily requiſite to the <hi>ſuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> of all other vertues, ſo is it their main <hi>ſupport, guardian</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhment.</hi> Without
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95868:90"/>
this, every other Vertue is precarious, and lies at the mercy of every croſs accident. Without this, let but a Piſtol be held to the breaſt, and the ſevereſt Chaſtity will be frighted into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, the moſt Heroic Friendſhip into trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and the moſt ardent Piety into renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of God and Religion. There is nothing among all the frailneſſes and uncertaintys of this ſublunary world ſo tottering and unſtable, as the vertue of a Coward. He has that within him that upon occaſion will infallibly betray every vertue he has; and to ſecure him from ſin, you muſt keep him from Temptation. This was the Principle the Devil went upon in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with <hi>Job, Do but put forth thy hand,</hi> (ſays he to God) <hi>and touch all that he hath, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> He was right e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> tho miſtaken in the <hi>application.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having now ſeen the uſefulneſs of this great Vertue, 'twill be worth while to enquire a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into its Nature. And that the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis not only variouſly and falſly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>the many,</hi> but too confuſedly and darkly deliver'd even by Moraliſts themſelves.</p>
                     <p>That which with the Vulgar paſſes for Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, is certainly nothing elſe but ſtupidity, deſperateneſs or fool-hardineſs; a brutiſh ſort of <hi>Knight-errantry</hi> in ſeeking out needleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and running into dangers without fear or wit; which is ſo far from having the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95868:90"/>
fore-mention'd property of Courage, of being a guardian, and ſecurity of our Vertues, that 'tis in it ſelf a ſin.</p>
                     <p>But are we like to have a better account of it from the Moraliſts? why they tell you that it is a Mediocrity between Fear and Boldneſs; So <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Ethics. But then as for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining what this Mediocrity is (wherein the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of the buſineſs lies) you are as much to ſeek as ever.</p>
                     <p>Others will tell you that 'tis a firmneſs of mind in ſuſtaining evils, and undertaking dangers. Accordingly they aſſign two parts of Courage <hi>Suſtinere &amp; Aggredi.</hi> Thus <hi>Epictetus</hi> and the School of the Stoics. But what it is thus firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuſtain or undertake an evil, and what evils are to be thus ſuſtain'd or undertaken, they either could not, or have not thought fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us.</p>
                     <p>In order therefore to the ſettling the Point in hand, I conſider 1ſt in general, that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage has evil of Pain for its object, which in ſome circumſtances is to be choſen or ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to. Whence I form this general Idea of Courage that 'tis a firm and peremptory reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Mind to chuſe evil of Pain in right circumſtances, or when 'tis truly eligible. This Definition I confeſs runs in general Terms, much like one of <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> but I intended it for no other. Only it has this advantage above his, that it lays a Foundation for one that is more particular.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:95868:91"/>For 'tis but here to ſubjoin when an evil is truly eligible, and the Idea of Courage will be ſufficiently determinate and expreſs. Now to make a thing eligible 'tis neceſſary that ſome way or other it appear good; evil being no way eligible under its own formality. And to make an evil put on the nature and appearance of good, two things are neceſſary. 1ſt that it be a leſſer evil than ſome other, and 2ly that the chuſing of it be a neceſſary Medium for the preventing of that other. Then, and in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, is evil truly eligible: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhall not be miſtaken in the Idea of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, if we define it to be ſuch a firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or diſpoſition of mind, whereby a man is fix'd and determin'd never to dread any evil, ſo far as to decline it when the chuſing it is the only remedy againſt a greater. And this is moſt eminently ſignalized in the caſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, when a man ſubmits to the greateſt evils of Pain to avoid that much greater one of Sin. This is the very ſummity and perfection of Courage, that which an <hi>Hannibal</hi> or a <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> could never equal in all their gallantry and feats of war: and I dare venture to pronounce, that he who would rather dye or part with any worldly intereſt than commit a ſin, can never be a Coward.</p>
                     <p>And here I cannot but take notice of a falſe notion of Honour and Courage whereby the world has been generally abuſed; eſpecially
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95868:91"/>
thoſe men that make the higheſt pretenſions to both. According to theſe mens Meaſures of things, 'tis ſufficient reaſon to poſt a man up for a Coward if he refuſe a Duell; And to merit a badge of Honour from the Herald's Office if he accept it. Theſe men would be ready to laugh at me, I know, as a lover of Paradoxes, ſhould I tell them that their characters muſt be quite tranſpoſed to make them true. And yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it, ſo it falls out that he who declines the Duell is indeed the man of Honour and Courage, and he who accepts it is the Coward. For he who declines it, deſpiſes the obloquy and ſcorn of the world that he may approve himſelf to God and his own Conſcience, would rather be pointed and hiſs'd at, than be damn'd; and ſo chuſes a leſſer evil to avoid a greater. But he that accepts the Duel, ſo dreads the loſs of his credit among thoſe whoſe good opinion is of no value, that to avoid it he chuſes to incur ſin and damnation; and ſo chuſes a greater evil to avoid a leſs.

                     <p>And accordingly we find that thoſe among the Philoſophic Sects that profeſs'd more than ordinary eminency in wiſdom or vertue, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed alſo a peculiar gravity of Habit, and ſolemnity of Behaviour, and the moſt ſacred and myſterious rites of Religion were uſually perform'd with <hi>ſilence;</hi> and that not only for <hi>decency,</hi> but for <hi>advantage.</hi> Thus the <hi>Italians</hi> who are the graveſt are alſo the moſt ingenious people under heaven, and 'tis a known obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s concerning <hi>melancholy,</hi> that it furthers Contemplation and makes great Wits.

world that can deſerve the name of <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> or be worth the ſerious thoughts of him who has an immortal Soul, and a Salvation to work out with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling.</hi> The greateſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affairs and intereſts are but <hi>Specious Trifles,</hi> and all our deſigns and emploiments about em <hi>Excentrical</hi> Motions, and ſolemn impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                     <p>And yet this is made the <hi>Center</hi> of all our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys and endeavours, the great <hi>Bent</hi> of the world points this way, hence are taken the meaſures of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> and Religion it ſelf is forced to truckle to worldly Policy.

                     </p>
                     <p>To cure therefore (if poſſible) this great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I have two Propoſitions to offer; 1ſt that no
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95868:95"/>
intereſt relating purely to this preſent world is of any great moment or concern to man, 2ly that to be very careful of our final intereſt, and to make ſure to our ſelves a happy eternity is indeed a thing of vaſt moment and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of theſe I know will ſeem very ſtrange and paradoxical to one that takes a proſpect of mankind, and contemplates the great ſtirr and hurry of the world, the Plottings of Stateſmen, the Emulations of Courtiers, and the Ambition of Princes, how buſy men are in their ſeveral concerns, what variety of deſigns are on foot, with what <hi>trembling</hi> eagerneſs they are proſecuted, and what grief attends our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments. Sure after ſuch a <hi>Scene</hi> as this one would be tempted to think, that there muſt be ſomthing very <hi>conſiderable</hi> in Human life, and that men had <hi>notable</hi> intereſts here at ſtake, it being a reproach to human nature that the world ſhould ſo generally combine to make ſuch ado about nothing.</p>
                     <p>But yet that <hi>this is their folly,</hi> not to inſiſt upon <q>that univerſal vanity which the wiſe and great Trier of the world has charged upon it, that <hi>Hope defer'd makes the heart ſick,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Prov. 13.</note> and yet Fruition does not cure it, that we are diſappointed in our enjoyments as well as in our loſſes, and yet that 'tis our hard fate to weep at the <hi>Funeral</hi> of our <hi>departed</hi> Pleaſures, tho we were little the happier for them when
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95868:96"/>
we had them; that our greateſt pleaſures are moſt tranſient, and great mirth always ends in heavineſs and demiſſion of ſpirit, that the more we <hi>love</hi> or <hi>enjoy</hi> the more we <hi>venture,</hi> and put our ſelves further within the reach of Fortune; that the greateſt men are not always the moſt contented, and that they who are moſt <hi>envy'd</hi> by <hi>others</hi> think themſelves more fit for their <hi>Pity;</hi>
                        </q> not to inſiſt I ſay on theſe or the like conſiderations, I ſhall fix only upon one, whereby I think twill plainly appear that there <hi>can</hi> be no intereſt relating purely to this world, that is of any great moment or concern to man. And that is the <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> and <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of our abode here.</p>
                     <p>The life of man in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>ſhadow.</hi> Now beſides that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance holds in many conſiderable reſpects, as in that it is partly Life and partly Death, as the other is partly Light and partly Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in that like a ſhadow whereever it paſſes it leaves no <hi>track</hi> behind it, in that it ſeems to be ſomthing when indeed it is nothing, in that 'tis always altering and ends on a ſuddain, and when at its full height and prime is often near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to <hi>Declenſion,</hi> as a ſhadow is to diſappear when at full length, there is yet another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of reſemblance, which has a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular aptneſs to our preſent purpoſe. The ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow can continue no longer at the <hi>utmoſt</hi> than the light of the Sun keeps its reſidence above
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95868:96"/>
the <hi>Horizontal</hi> line, which is but a little portion of time, but it may fall much ſhort of that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod by the interpoſition of a cloud, and when that may be is as uncertain as the <hi>weather,</hi> and depends upon a thouſand accidents.</p>
                     <p>And thus 'tis with our <hi>lives.</hi> No man can lengthen out his days beyond that <hi>natural Term</hi> which is ſet him by the temperament of the firſt <hi>Qualitys,</hi> which yet are of ſuch jarring and <hi>unſociable</hi> natures that they can't dwell long together in a <hi>vital</hi> amity. But then how far, and how many ways, he may fall ſhort of that compaſs, depends upon ſo many hidden cauſes, and ſo many little accidents that it may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd among the greateſt of uncertaintys. So that there is nothing in all human life ſo frail and uncertain as <hi>life</hi> it <hi>ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A conſideration ſufficient to depretiate and vilify all the entertainments and intereſts of the <hi>Animal</hi> life, and to call off our care from the objects of ſecular Happineſs tho there were no other vanity in them. For were they never ſo good and ſolid in <hi>themſelves,</hi> yet the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which they ſtand is ſo weak and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that 'tis dangerous leaning <hi>hard</hi> upon them. They would be even upon this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> ſtatue, made up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of <hi>rich metal,</hi> but founded upon <hi>feet</hi> of <hi>clay.</hi> And upon this account they are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd as vile and contemptible as they are ruinous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:95868:97"/>This is a conſideration indeed that has but little effect in the world, and the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe few give any ſerious heed and attention to it. They know it indeed <hi>habitually,</hi> and muſt confeſs it if put to the <hi>queſtion,</hi> but it lies <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant</hi> in 'em, and they ſeldom actually attend to it. And therefore 'tis that the voice bids the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Cry</hi> and <hi>proclaim</hi> it <hi>aloud</hi> that <hi>all fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of the field.</hi> He is bid to cry <hi>aloud,</hi> thereby intimating both the <hi>importance</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> and the general <hi>ſtupidity</hi> of men in not conſidering it.</p>
                     <p>But if men would but often and ſeriouſly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of life, I perſwade my ſelf they would not ſet their hearts much upon any thing in it, but would look upon all its Pleaſures, Honours and Profits with the ſame indifferency that the <hi>haſty Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller</hi> does upon the ſpecious fields and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows which he paſſes by. For to what purpoſe I pray, ſhould man who holds his <hi>Tenement</hi> here by ſuch a ſhort and unſtable <hi>Tenure,</hi> that can't live long and <hi>may</hi> dye preſently, be ſo buſy and thoughtful about worldly concerns? The ancient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> tho their ſpan was ſo very much longer than ours, thought it hardly worth while to build houſes, but contented themſelves to grow <hi>gray</hi> in <hi>Tents;</hi> and what do we mean who in compariſon to them are but <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But to be a little particular, to what purpoſe ſhould man who walketh in a <hi>vain ſhadow, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet</hi> himſelf alſo thus in <hi>vain,</hi> and be ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in heaping up riches when he can't tell who ſhall gather them?

                     </p>
                     <p>There is certainly nothing in all <hi>Nature</hi> ſo ſtrange and unaccountable as the <hi>actions</hi> of ſome men. <hi>They ſee,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>that wiſe men alſo dye and periſh together as well as the ignorant and fooliſh, and leave their riches for others, and yet they think</hi> (at leaſt act as if they did) <hi>that their houſes ſhall continue for ever, and that their dwelling places ſhall endure from one generation to another, and call their lands after their own names.</hi>

                     <p>We have ſeen how frivolous and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt affairs of this world are, how unworthy to be made the objects of our <hi>ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> much more to be the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of our lives, we have weigh'd them in the <hi>Ballance,</hi> and they are found <hi>wanting.</hi> But man is a Creature of brisk and active facultys, and is there no em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for him? yes, as God has furniſh'd him with Powers, ſo alſo has he aſſign'd him a work, and ſuch a one too as is to be perform'd with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling.</hi> There is a good fight to be fought, there is a whole Body of ſin to be deſtroy'd, there are Paſſions to be mortify'd, Habits to be unlearnt, Affections to be purify'd, Vertuous and holy diſpoſitions to be acquired, Acts of vertue to be oppoſed againſt Acts of ſin, and Habits againſt Habits, in a word there is a Heaven to be obtain'd, and a Hell to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This indeed is a great work, and of great concernment to be done, and ſuch as calls for our principal, (I could almoſt ſay our whole) care and diligence. The great neceſſity of which for more diſtinctneſs ſake, I ſhall repreſent in a few Conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="tcp:95868:99"/>And Iſt, it highly concerns us to be very careful concerning our final intereſt, becauſe of the vaſt, the infinite Moment of the thing. For certainly it can be no leſs whether a man ſhall be <hi>Damn'd</hi> or <hi>Saved, eternally</hi> Happy, or <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> Miſerable. No man certainly that thinks at all, can think this an <hi>indifferent</hi> matter, or if he does he will one day be ſadly convinc'd of the contrary, when he ſhall curſe the day of his Birth, and wiſh for the <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>Annihilation.</hi> The loweſt conception we can frame of the condition of the <hi>Damn'd,</hi> is an utter excluſion from the Beatific preſence of God. And tho the non-enjoyment of this be no great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>ſenſual</hi> men in this ſtate and Region of <hi>exile,</hi> who perhaps would be content that God ſhould keep Heaven to himſelf, ſo he would let them have the free uſe of the <hi>Earth,</hi> yet hereafter when the Powers of their Souls ſhall be awaken'd to their full vigour and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, when they ſhall have a lively and thorough apprehenſion of true Happineſs, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Beautys of the Supreme good, there will ariſe ſuch a vehement <hi>Thirſt,</hi> ſuch an intenſe longing in the Soul, as will infinitely exceed the moſt exalted languiſhments of <hi>Love,</hi> the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Droughts of a <hi>Fever.</hi> The Soul will then <hi>point</hi> to the <hi>Center</hi> of Happineſs with her full bent and <hi>verticity,</hi> which yet ſhe ſhall find ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly out of her reach, and ſo full of <hi>Deſire</hi> and full of <hi>Deſpair</hi> ſhe ſhall lament both her <hi>Folly</hi>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:95868:99"/>
and her <hi>Miſery</hi> to eternal ages. And who is able to dwell even with <hi>theſe</hi> everlaſting Burnings?</p>
                     <p>But 2ly as an Argument for our great Care we may conſider, that as the intereſt is great, ſo a more than ordinary care is neceſſary to ſecure it. And that upon ſeveral accounts. Iſt becauſe our Redemption by Chriſt is not our immediat and actual diſcharge from ſin, (as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> would have <hi>it</hi>) but only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtating us into a <hi>Capacity</hi> of Pardon and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, which is to be <hi>actually</hi> obtain'd by the performance of <hi>Conditions,</hi> without which we ſhall be ſo far from being the better for what has been done and ſuffer'd for us, that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation will be ſo much the heavier for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to <hi>finiſh</hi> ſo great Salvation.</p>
                     <p>2ly, Becauſe the Conditions of our Salvation tho temper'd with much mercy and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to human infirmity, are yet ſo difficult as to engage us to put forth our whole might to the work. A great part of Chriſtianity is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry harſh to Fleſh and Blood, however to the <hi>Habituated</hi> Diſciple Chriſt's <hi>yoke</hi> may be <hi>eaſy</hi> and his <hi>burthen light.</hi> And accordingly the Path that leads to life is call'd <hi>narrow,</hi> and the gate (tho open'd by our Saviour) is yet ſo <hi>ſtrait</hi> that we are bid to <hi>ſtrive</hi> to enter in at it. And <hi>the Righteous ſcarcely are ſav'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, becauſe there is a ſtrong confederacy againſt us among the Powers of darkneſs. We have a very potent and malicious enemy, who
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95868:100"/>
envys man ſhould arrive to thoſe happy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from whence himſelf <hi>by tranſgreſſion fell;</hi> And accordingly, there is a great woe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd by the Angel againſt the inhabitants of the earth, becauſe the Devil is come down among them having great wrath. And this is made by the Apoſtle himſelf an Argument for more than ordinary care and circumſpection. <hi>Be ſober,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be vigilant, becauſe your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary the Devil walks about as a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, becauſe we have but a little time for this our great work, and that too very preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and uncertain. Our <hi>glaſs</hi> holds but very little <hi>ſand</hi> tho 'twere to be <hi>all</hi> ſpent, and drawn out in the <hi>running.</hi> But there are alſo ſeveral accidental impediments that may <hi>intercept</hi> its paſſage; And therefore as this was alledg'd as an argument for <hi>indifferency</hi> about the things of <hi>this</hi> world, ſo for the ſame reaſon, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to be eminently careful in the grand buſineſs of the <hi>next.</hi> He that duly conſiders how many perſons dye ſuddainly, how many more <hi>may,</hi> and that none can engage for it that he <hi>himſelf</hi> ſhall not, muſt needs confeſs himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely concern'd to improve this <hi>ſhort,</hi> this <hi>uncertain</hi> opportunity, this <hi>only</hi> time of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to work with all his might while 'tis <hi>day,</hi> before the <hi>night come, when no man can work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it concerns us to uſe a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care and diligence in ſecuring this our
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95868:100"/>
great intereſt, becauſe after all our Care and Vigilancy, all our ſtrictneſſes and ſeveritys, we don't know the juſt and preciſe meaſures of <hi>Qualification,</hi> and how much <hi>Trimming</hi> of our <hi>Lamps</hi> is requiſite to fit 'em for the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of God. For tho we are well aſſured in <hi>general</hi> from the terms of the Evangelical Covenant, that if we <hi>repent</hi> we ſhall be <hi>forgiven,</hi> yet there is a great Latitude in Repentance, and what degree in ſome caſes will be available, is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret God has kept to himſelf. For we don't know the full heinouſneſs of our Sins, nor how far God was provoked by 'em, nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by what degrees of ſorrow and amendment he will be appeas'd. And 'tis moſt certain there is a mighty difference. To <hi>Simon Magus</hi> 'twas almoſt a deſperate caſ<hi>e: If peradventure</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Act. 8. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</hi> And ſome are ſaid to be ſav'd with <hi>fear,</hi> &amp;<note place="margin">Jud. 22.</note> as it were pull'd out of the <hi>fire.</hi> And we know what the great Apoſtle has ſaid, <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not thereby juſtify'd.</hi> All which argues a great latitude and variety even in <hi>neceſſary</hi> preparations, and how to ſtate the matter <hi>exactly</hi> we don't know, and therefore as far as we are able ſhould be ſure to do <hi>enough,</hi> for we may eaſily do too <hi>little,</hi> and can never do too <hi>much</hi> in a matter of ſuch high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>From all which I conclude, Iſt that thoſe who withdraw themſelves (as far as is conſiſtent
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95868:101"/>
with charity and the proſecution of the public good) from the noiſe, hurry and buſineſs of the world, that they may apply themſelves more ſerenely and entirely to a life of Devotion and Religion, and more freely and undiſtractedly attend upon the grand concern of another world, act very <hi>wiſely</hi> and <hi>prudently.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> is <hi>wiſdom,</hi> to take a right eſtimate of things, to proportion our care to their value, and to mind that moſt which is moſt concerning. This is what the Apoſtle commends, <hi>to lay aſide every weight,</hi> that we may be the ſurer to win the great <hi>prize,</hi> and <hi>ſo to run as to obtain.</hi> This laſtly is the very part which <hi>Mary</hi> choſe, and which our Lord aſſures us ſhall <hi>never be taken away from her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again I conclude, that all thoſe who are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly negligent of this their grand inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or that do not principally regard it, and as our Saviour ſpeaks, in the firſt place <hi>ſeek the kingdom of God,</hi> that are more intent upon this world than the next, that will venture to play the knave for a little <hi>preferment,</hi> that make uſe of Religion as an inſtrument for ſecular deſigns, in one word, that in any kind forfeit their great intereſt in the <hi>other</hi> world, for a little in <hi>this,</hi> are the greateſt <hi>Fools</hi> in nature. This Meaſure I confeſs will take in a great many, and ſome perhaps who would think it a great affront to be reckon'd of the number. But it can't be help'd, the charge is moſt unqueſtionably true,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95868:101"/>
and they themſelves however conceited of their wit and parts now, will once be of the ſame opinion, when they ſhall ſay, <hi>we Fools thought his life madneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God grant we may all ſo number our days, and ſo compare our two intereſts, as to apply our hearts to <hi>greater</hi> wiſdom.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. IT has been the curious emploiment of ſo many and ſo excellent Pens to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Exiſtence of a God, and this they have done with ſuch variety of Arguments, Moral, Phyſical and Metaphyſical, that howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eaſy it may be to contrive new <hi>Poſtures,</hi> and ring other Changes upon the ſame Bells, 'tis yet almoſt as difficult to find out an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the proof of a God that has not been uſed already, as to reſiſt the Cogency of thoſe that <hi>have.</hi> So that here if any where, that of <hi>Solomon</hi> is more than ordinarily verify'd, <hi>The thing that has been it is that which ſhall</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The neweſt indeed that has of late years appear'd to the world is that of the celebrated <hi>Deſ-Cartes,</hi> taken from the Idea of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd both abſolutely in its ſelf, as including all kinds and degrees of Perfection and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95868:104"/>
Exiſtence, and as 'tis ſubjected in the mind of man, which (as he contends) could never have had ſuch an Idea, were there not ſomthing which had all that Perfection in it <hi>Formally</hi> or eminently, which is in the Idea <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Now tho this Procedure of his be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily fine and ſubtile, and ſuch as (to the firſt part at leaſt) will appear no leſs ſtrong and concluding to any capable and indifferent Perſon, that conſiders it as 'tis managed at large by its ingenious Author, yet this was not a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion newly excogitated but only revived by him. For <hi>Aquinas</hi> had before lighted upon the former and refuſed it, and he is beholding to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the School of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> for the latter.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I ſpeak not this to diminiſh one <hi>ray</hi> from the <hi>glory</hi> of that incomparable Speculatiſt.

                        <p n="1">1. HAving undertaken to demonſtrate the Exiſtence of God from the ſteddy and immutable nature of <hi>Truth,</hi> I am firſt to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>Equivocalneſs</hi> or latitude of the word, and then to point out to that determinate part, which I intend for the ground of my <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The moſt general Partition of Truth is into <hi>Truth of the Thing</hi> and <hi>Truth of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> or (according to the language of the Schools) Truth of the <hi>Object</hi> and Truth of the <hi>Subject.</hi> Both of theſe again have a double <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſion.</hi> For by Truth of the Object may be underſtood either that <hi>Tranſcendental</hi> verity which is convertible with <hi>Ens,</hi> and runs through the whole <hi>Circle</hi> of Being whereby every thing is really what it is, which is <hi>ſimple</hi> Truth. Or elſe certain Relations and Habitudes of things one towards another whether Affirmatively or Negatively, which is <hi>Complex</hi> Truth.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="196" facs="tcp:95868:105"/>3. And ſo again by Truth of the <hi>Subject</hi> may be underſtood either a due conformity between the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>Object,</hi> when I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound what is compounded, and divide what is divided, which is <hi>Logical</hi> Truth. Or elſe a due conformity between the <hi>words</hi> and the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> when I ſpeak as I think, which is <hi>Moral</hi> Truth or <hi>Veracity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Now the Truth, upon whoſe immutable Nature I build the Demonſtration of a God, is not that of the <hi>Subject,</hi> but that of the <hi>Object.</hi> Nor that neither according to its <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>Tranſcendental</hi> acceptation, but as it ſignifies certain immutable relations and habitudes of things one towards another by way of Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Negation, which is <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Object Complex.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. TWo things are here aſſerted, 1ſt that there are Relations and Habitudes of things towards one another, and 2ly that they are ſteddy and immutable. Firſt I ſay, there are certain relations and habitudes betwixt thing and thing. Thus there is a certain habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude between ſome <hi>Premiſes</hi> and ſome <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
                           <pb n="197" facs="tcp:95868:105"/>
for any thing will not follow from any thing; between ſome <hi>Objects</hi> and ſome <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys;</hi> between ſome <hi>ends</hi> and ſome <hi>means;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome <hi>Subjects</hi> and ſome <hi>Predicates,</hi> and the like.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This is as true as that there is any ſuch thing as <hi>Truth.</hi> For Truth is nothing elſe, but the Compoſition or Diviſion of Ideas according to their reſpective Habitudes and Relations. And without <hi>Truth</hi> there can be no ſuch thing as <hi>Knowledg,</hi> for knowledg is <hi>Truth of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> 'tis a man's thinking of things as they are; and that ſuppoſes Truth of the <hi>Object.</hi> Which whoſoever denies, contradicts himſelf, and eſtabliſhes the Propoſition which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to overthrow; and conſequently, <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> Scepticiſm is the very extremity of non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe and inconſiſtency.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And as there are certain habitudes and relations between things; ſo aly ſome of them are ſteddy and immutable, that never were <hi>made</hi> by any underſtanding or will, nor can ever be <hi>unmade</hi> or null'd by them; but have a fixt and unalterable <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> from everlaſting to everlaſting. And conſequently there are not only <hi>Truths,</hi> but <hi>eternal</hi> Truths.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As firſt in <hi>general,</hi> 'tis a Propoſition of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and eternal Truth, that there muſt be ever ſuch a thing as <hi>Truth,</hi> or that <hi>ſomthing</hi> muſt be <hi>True,</hi> for let it be affirm'd or denyed, Truth thruſts in upon us either way. And ſo 2ly
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95868:106"/>
there are many <hi>particular</hi> Propoſitions of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unchangeable Verity, as in <hi>Logic,</hi> that the Cauſe is always before the Effect in order of Nature; in <hi>Phyſics,</hi> that all local motion is by ſucceſſion; in <hi>Metaphyſics,</hi> that nothing can be and not be at once; in <hi>Mathematics,</hi> that all right Angles are equal, that thoſe lines which are parallel to the ſame Right line are alſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to each other, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like are ſtanding and <hi>irrepealable</hi> Truths, ſuch as have no precarious exiſtence, or arbitrarious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon any will or underſtanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and ſuch as all Intellectual operations do not <hi>make,</hi> but <hi>ſuppoſe;</hi> it being as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of underſtanding to make that Truth which it ſpeculates, as 'tis againſt the nature of the eye to create that light by which it ſees, or of an Image to make that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which it <hi>repreſents.</hi>

HAving gain'd this Point that there are eternal and immutable Veritys or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes of things, the next will be, that upon this Poſtulatum it neceſſarily follows that the <hi>Simple Eſſences</hi> of things muſt be alſo eternal and immutable.

For how can there be any ſuch <hi>Habitudes</hi> or <hi>Relations</hi> without the <hi>Simple Eſſences</hi> themſelves from which they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult?</hi> As for inſtance, how can any Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Propoſition, ſuppoſe that of <hi>Euclid,</hi> that if two Circles touch one another inwardly they have not the ſame common Center, have this habitude, unleſs there be two ſuch diſtinct ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Eſſences as <hi>Circle</hi> and <hi>Center?</hi> Theſe Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes

If therefore there can be no Truth of the Object <hi>Complex</hi> without Truth of the Object <hi>Simple,</hi> and there can be no Habitudes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Compoſition and Diviſion without the ſimple Eſſences themſelves, it follows that whenſoever the one does exiſt the other muſt exiſt alſo, and conſequently if the one be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal the other muſt be eternal alſo, and ſo (to recur to the former inſtance) if it be a Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal Truth that if two Circles touch one another inwardly they have not the ſame Common Center, the two diſtinct ſimple Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences of <hi>Circle</hi> and <hi>Center</hi> muſt be from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alſo, and conſequently the ſimple Eſſences of things are eternal and immutable, which was the point to be <hi>here</hi> demonſtrated.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. FRom the eternity of eſſential Habitudes we have demonſtrated the neceſſity that the ſimple eſſences of things ſhould be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.

                        <p n="2">2.

                        <p n="1">1. THis evidently follows from the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foregoing Section, for if the ſimple Eſſences of things have a real and eternal exiſtence in ſome underſtanding, what conſequence can be more plain than that there is a Mind or underſtanding eternally exiſting?

                        <head>Poſt-ſcript.</head>
                        <p>THis <hi>Eſſay</hi> has lain by me a conſiderable time, and I have lately review'd it with all the <hi>coldneſs</hi> and <hi>indifferency</hi> of a <hi>Stranger,</hi> and with more <hi>ſeverity</hi> perhaps than I am like to meet with from the moſt <hi>Prejudiced Reader.</hi> I have <hi>turn'd</hi> it and <hi>view'd</hi> it on all ſides, and, after the moſt deliberate and impartial ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that I could make, I muſt needs own, that I am not conſcious of the leaſt <hi>flaw</hi> in the whole Procedure.</p>
                        <p>I know but of one place that is liable to any <hi>reaſonable</hi> exception, and that is in the fourth Section. The Propoſition there maintain'd is this, that <hi>ſince there are eternal and immutable Veritys or Habitudes of things, the ſimple Eſſences of things muſt be alſo eternal and immutable.</hi> Here it may be objected, that theſe Habitudes are not attributed <hi>abſolutely</hi> to the ſimple Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences as <hi>actually</hi> exiſting, but only <hi>Hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> that whenſoever they <hi>ſhall</hi> exiſt, they ſhall alſo carry ſuch <hi>Relations</hi> to one another. There is you'l ſay only an Hypothetical Connexion between the <hi>Subject</hi> and the <hi>Predicate,</hi> not an abſolute <hi>Poſition</hi> of either.</p>
                        <p>But in anſwer to this I ſay firſt, that theſe Habitudes are not (as is ſuppoſed) only by way
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95868:109"/>
of <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> but <hi>abſolutely</hi> attributed to the ſimple Eſſences as <hi>actually</hi> exiſting. For when I ſay, for inſtance, that every part of a Circle is equally diſtant from the Center, this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition does not hang in <hi>ſuſpence,</hi> then to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd when the things ſhall exiſt in <hi>Nature,</hi> but is at <hi>preſent actually</hi> true, as true as it ever <hi>will</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be; and conſequently, I may thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that the things themſelves <hi>already</hi> are. There is no neceſſity, I confeſs, they ſhould exiſt in <hi>Nature,</hi> (which is all that the Objection proves) but <hi>exiſt</hi> they muſt. For of <hi>Nothing</hi> there can be no <hi>Affections.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But 2ly, ſuppoſe I grant what the Objector would have, that theſe Habitudes are not <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> attributed to the ſimple Eſſences, but only by way of <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> yet I don't ſee what he can gain by this conceſſion. For thus much at leaſt is attributed to the ſimple Eſſences at <hi>preſent,</hi> that whenſoever they <hi>ſhall</hi> exiſt, ſuch and ſuch Habitudes will attend them. I ſay, thus much is attributed <hi>actually,</hi> and at <hi>preſent:</hi> But now how can any thing be ſaid of that which is not? There is therefore another way of exiſting beſides that in <hi>rerum Natura;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the <hi>Mundus Archetypus</hi> or the <hi>Ideal world,</hi> where all the <hi>Rationes rerum</hi> or ſimple Eſſences of things whereof there are ſtanding and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Affirmations and Negations, have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immutable Exiſtence, before ever they enter upon the <hi>ſtage</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="206" facs="tcp:95868:110"/>Nor ought this <hi>Ideal</hi> way of ſubſiſting to ſeem ſtrange, when even while things have a <hi>Natural</hi> ſubſiſtence, the Propoſitions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them are not verify'd according to their <hi>Natural,</hi> but according to their <hi>Ideal</hi> ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Thus we demonſtrate ſeveral Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning a right line, a Circle <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet 'tis moſt certain that none of theſe are to be found in Nature according to that <hi>exactneſs</hi> ſuppoſed in the <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> Such and ſuch Attributes therefore belong to them not as they are in <hi>Nature,</hi> but as they are in their <hi>Ideas.</hi> This is a Notion very frequently <hi>glanc'd</hi> at by Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and 'tis the Concluſion of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that the Soul <hi>Omnia vera cognoſcit in rationibus aeternis,</hi> Part. 1. Qu. 84. Art. 5. And of late years this Notion has been much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by the ingenious Philoſopher <hi>Du Hamel</hi> in his book <hi>De Mente humana.</hi> And if this be true in Propoſitions whoſe Subjects are in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> much more is it in <hi>eternal</hi> Propoſitions, whoſe ſimple Eſſences have not always a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> exiſtence. Theſe can no otherwiſe be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd but by the <hi>coeternal</hi> Exiſtence of <hi>ſimple Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences</hi> in the <hi>Ideal</hi> world.</p>
                        <p>One thing I have more to add in the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this <hi>Eſſay;</hi> Whereas in the 3d Section it was aſſerted that the nature of Truth is ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and immutable, and ſuch as has no preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious exiſtence or arbitrarious dependénce up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any underſtanding whatever, and yet in the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95868:110"/>
5th Section 'tis affirm'd that it owes its exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence to ſome mind or other; leſt one part of this Meditation ſhould be thought to claſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, I thought it requiſite to adjuſt this ſeeming contradiction. For the clearing of which, we muſt be beholding to that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Diſtinction of the Platonic School, of the Divine Mind into <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive</hi> and <hi>Exhibitive.</hi> Truth does by no means <hi>depend</hi> upon any mind as <hi>Conceptive,</hi> whether Human or Divine, but is <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> by it, which is the ſenſe of the 3d Section.

                     <list>
                        <item>1ſt, That it is a ſtate of Service,</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>The eviction of theſe two Propoſitions will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both the <hi>Aſſertion</hi> of the Chriſtian Law and its <hi>Vindication,</hi> and be a plenary juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Divine Author from the imputation of two ſorts of Adverſarys, thoſe that reflect upon his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> by ſuppoſing that he requires <hi>nothing</hi> to be done by his ſervants, and thoſe that reflect upon his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> by ſuppoſing him a <hi>Hard Maſter,</hi> and that he requires unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able performances.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I begin therefore with the 1ſt Propoſition concerning the Chriſtian Inſtitution, that it is a <hi>ſervice.</hi> It is moſt certain that the Chriſtian Religion according to the genuine ſenſe and deſign of its Divine Author, is the moſt wiſe and excellent Inſtitution that could poſſibly be framed, both for the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95868:113"/>
and the beſt Intereſts of <hi>Mankind.</hi> And <hi>without Controverſy</hi> (if we take it as 'tis exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to us in the inſpired writings)<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs.</hi> But if we conſult the perverſe gloſſes and Comments of ſome of our Chriſtian <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and take our meaſures of the Chriſtian Religion from thoſe ill-favour'd Schemes and Draughts of it we meet with in <hi>Dutch Syſtemes,</hi> as ſome Chriſtians are the worſt of <hi>men,</hi> ſo will their Religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the worſt of <hi>Religions,</hi> a ſenſeleſs and ridiculous Inſtitution, not worthy the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of a wiſe <hi>Politician,</hi> much leſs of him who is the <hi>Wiſdom of the Father.</hi> It fares here with Chriſtianity as with a <hi>Picture,</hi> that is drawn at ſo many <hi>remote</hi> hands, till at length it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates from the <hi>Original</hi> Truth, and wants an <hi>under-title</hi> to diſcover whoſe it is. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whatever Declamations are made againſt <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> the worſt enemys of the Chriſtian Religion are ſome of thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and teach it. For if it be in reality as ſome (who call themſelves <hi>Orthodox</hi>) deſcribe it, I may boldly ſay, that 'tis neither for the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God to be the <hi>Author</hi> of ſuch a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor for the intereſt of men to be <hi>guided</hi> by it, and that as <hi>ſin took occaſion by</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the Law,</hi> ſo may it (and that more juſtly) by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> too, to <hi>deceive</hi> and ruin the world; by that Goſpel which was intended as the Inſtrument both of its temporal and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:95868:113"/>3. For if you look upon Chriſtianity as ſome men are pleas'd to hold the <hi>Perſpective,</hi> it is no way accommodated for the promotion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Vertue, but is rather a perfect Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from all duty, and a <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs.</hi> For among other miſrepreſentations of the Goſpel this is one, (and I think the moſt pernicious one that the Sophiſtry of Hell could ever ſuggeſt) that it requires nothing to be done by its Proſelytes. A Notion ſo ridiculous and miſchievous as is fit for none but a profane <hi>Epicure</hi> to embrace, who may be allow'd to make his <hi>Religion</hi> as idle and <hi>Sedentary</hi> as he does his <hi>God.</hi> Nay, 'tis not only ridiculous and miſchievous, but in the higheſt meaſure <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</hi> For what greater <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> can there be than that, which ſtrikes not only at ſome of the main branches, but at the very Root of Chriſtianity, and at once evacuates the entire purpoſe and aim of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But to ſet this mark upon the right fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, there are three ſorts of men that come in ſome meaſure or other under this Charge. The firſt are the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ignorant enough in expreſs terms to aſſert, that the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt does wholly excuſe us from all manner of Duty and Obedience, as if we <hi>Libertins</hi> of the Goſpel were ſo far from being bound to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> that we are not to work at all; and as if the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95868:114"/>
Deſign of Chriſt's coming were only to ſatisfy for the tranſgreſſions committed againſt the <hi>old</hi> Covenant, and not at all to introduce a <hi>new</hi> one, and to diſcharge us from the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Moral</hi> as well as <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nay ſome there are among them that carry the buſineſs yet higher, and exclude not only the Repentance and good works of men, but even the Mediation of Chriſt himſelf, at leaſt the neceſſity of it, by ſuppoſing an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating</hi> Juſtification or Pardon from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which they found upon the ſecret decree and Counſel of God.</p>

The next that have a ſhare in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Charge are thoſe, who make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity a matter of bare ſpeculation, and think all Religion abſolv'd in <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of Opinion; that care not how men <hi>live</hi> but only how they <hi>teach,</hi> and are ſo over intent upon the <hi>Creed,</hi> that they neglect the <hi>Commandments.</hi> Little conſidering that <hi>Opinion</hi> is purely in order to <hi>Practiſe,</hi> and that Orthodoxy of judgment is neceſſary only in <hi>ſuch</hi> matters, where a miſtake would be of dangerous influence to our <hi>actions,</hi> that is in <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> So that the neceſſity of <hi>thinking</hi> rightly is derived from the neceſſity of <hi>doing</hi> rightly, and conſequently the latter is the more neceſſary of the two.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I am as ready to grant as the moſt zealous ſtickler for <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> can deſire, that our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are under obligation in Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95868:114"/>
but withall I think it abſurd that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation ſhould <hi>terminate</hi> there, ſince then 'twould follow, 1ſt that all Theological Science were merely ſpeculative, 2ly that we are bound to exact Orthodoxy in <hi>all</hi> ſpeculations, (there being then no reaſon why in one and not in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) and 3ly, (which is the greateſt abſurdity of all) that we are obliged and tied up to no purpoſe, becauſe nothing is effected by it. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore we are obliged to ſoundneſs of Judgment, 'tis purely in order to the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Practiſe, and conſequently ſolitary Orthodoxy does not ſatisfy its <hi>own</hi> end, much leſs that of Chriſtianity. For to what purpoſe ſerves the <hi>Direction</hi> of the <hi>Compaſs,</hi> if there be neither wind nor ſail to carry on the veſſel to the Haven.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. But there are yet another ſort of men who are juſtly chargeable with expunging all Duty from the Chriſtian Inſtitution; I mean the <hi>Solifidians,</hi> who under a pretence of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the merits of the Croſs, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine Grace, require nothing of a Chriſtian in order to his <hi>Juſtification</hi> and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance before God, but firmly to rely on the ſatisfaction and merits of Chriſt, and without any more ado to <hi>apply</hi> all to himſelf. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they do not only contradict the <hi>general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> and <hi>particular expreſſes</hi> of the Goſpel, but treſpaſs againſt all <hi>Logic</hi> and common ſenſe. They contradict the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> in requiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95868:115"/>
                        <hi>but</hi> faith, whereas that (as we ſhall ſee anon) equally requires <hi>obedience.</hi> And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict common <hi>ſenſe</hi> in requiring <hi>ſuch</hi> a Faith. For they put the Concluſion before the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and make that the firſt act of faith which ſuppoſes others, and in due order ought to be the laſt. And beſides, they make that act of Faith contribute <hi>inſtrumentally</hi> towards the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting</hi> of Juſtification, which in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is <hi>conſequent</hi> to it, and ſuppoſes it <hi>already effected.</hi> For I muſt be firſt Juſtify'd before I can rightly believe that I am ſo, otherwiſe I ſhall believe a falſe Propoſition, ſince (as the moſt elementary Logician well knows) the certitude of the ſubject does not <hi>make</hi> but <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that of the object.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But I could diſpenſe with the <hi>unphiloſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs</hi> of this their Hypotheſis were it not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>unchriſtian,</hi> and utterly deſtructive of all Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vertue. The great miſchief is, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the cords of Duty, and exclude the neceſſity of Obedience as <hi>really</hi> and effectually, tho not ſo <hi>formally</hi> and expreſly as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> do. For they require nothing but Faith to qualify a man for Pardon, and tho afterwards for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty's ſake they come in halting with good works, yet 'tis at ſuch a time when they might as well have left them out. 'Tis when the grand buſineſs (for which alone they could be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary) is over, <hi>when the man is number'd among the children of God, and his lot is among the Saints.</hi>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:95868:115"/>
And to ſay here that good works are neceſſary to <hi>Salvation</hi> tho not to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> is a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry above my conception, or rather an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity below my further notice. Nor will it ſalve the matter to ſay that they are neceſſary to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> our Juſtification before <hi>men,</hi> or to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to our <hi>ſelves</hi> and the like, for alas what does ſuch a neceſſity amount to? No more than this, that they are neceſſary for <hi>ſuch</hi> ends which <hi>themſelves</hi> are not neceſſary. And beſides, how can they <hi>declare</hi> or aſcertain our Juſtification when they are not the <hi>conditions</hi> of it? So that 'tis plain both from the <hi>lateneſs</hi> of the time when, and from the <hi>incompetency</hi> of the grounds for which they inſert good works, that they put them merely out of <hi>Complaiſance,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think them neceſſary, but becauſe they are aſhamed to declare expreſly that they are not. Which appears yet further from the <hi>nature</hi> of thoſe works they are at <hi>length</hi> pleas'd to inſert. They are ſuch (for there is nothing that theſe men are ſo much affraid of as <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting</hi>) as are much ſhort of that ſincerity and perfection which is required by the Goſpel. For 'tis notorious that they ſet the ſtate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation ſo <hi>low</hi> that 'tis conſiſtent with the dominion and prevalency of ſin. A bare relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy of the Spirit (tho foil'd in the conflict) againſt the fleſh, is eſteem'd a ſufficient mark of a <hi>Regenerate</hi> perſon; and this every ſinner that has the leaſt Remains of Conſcience, the

                     </p>
                     <p n="25">25. I deſcend now from the things that are to be <hi>believ'd</hi> to the things that are to be <hi>done</hi> in the Chriſtian Religion. And that thoſe may appear to be a Reaſonable Service, I conſider firſt in general, that the Chriſtian Law is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Law of Nature <hi>retriev'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd</hi> and ſet in a <hi>clearer</hi> light. Chriſt indeed added ſome new Precepts that were not in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but not any that were not in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature. That</hi> he only reſtored and reſcued from the Sophiſtications of ill Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95868:122"/>
and the corruptions of degenerate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For the clearer underſtanding of which Propoſition 'tis to be obſerv'd, that the Law of Nature was <hi>twice</hi> retriev'd, by <hi>Moſes</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Moſes did it imperfectly, with a <hi>ſhaking</hi> hand, and with a <hi>rude</hi> Pencil; He adopted 'tis true, into his Table as many of Natures Laws as were neceſſary to the preſent ſtate and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Jewiſh people, but he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the whole <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Digeſt</hi> of Nature. For there are many Inſtances and Branches of the Natural Law which are no way reducible to the Moſaic Tables, unleſs hook'd in by long tedious conſequences, which as the Law never intended, ſo neither is one of a thouſand able to deduce them from it, as appears in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Gratitude to Benefactors, Love to Enemys, Forgiveneſs of Injurys, Humility and the like, which are excellences of the <hi>firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitude</hi> in the Imperial conſtitutions of Nature, but not tranſcribed in the Copy and Extract of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as too refined for the groſsneſs of that Age, for the hardneſs of the Jewiſh people, and for the Infancy of that Diſpenſation.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. This therefore was reſerv'd for the work of a Diviner Prophet, who ſhould retrieve the Law of Nature to the full, and reſtore it as at the Beginning. For he came (as he te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifys<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> of himſelf, and as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to another purpoſe) to fill up Moſes his Law, which implies that it was imperfect and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95868:123"/>
deficient; and wherein ſhould its defectiveneſs conſiſt, but in wanting ſomthing of the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Law. The Chriſtian Law therefore is only the Law of Nature retriev'd.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. This being premiſed, 'tis but now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the formal notion of the Law of Nature is, and we have found out one <hi>general</hi> meaſure whereby to judge of the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law. Now by the Law of Nature I ſuppoſe we all underſtand certain Practical Maxims or Dictates, the obſerving or tranſgreſſing of which, conſidering the preſent ſyſtem of the univerſe, have a <hi>natural</hi> conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the well or ill being of man, either as to his <hi>private</hi> or <hi>political</hi> capacity. I ſay, conſidering the <hi>preſent ſyſtem</hi> of the univerſe. For no queſtion, God might have ſo contrived the Order and Scheme of the Creation, as that many of thoſe things which are now for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> might have been for the <hi>disintereſt</hi> of mankind, as he might have ſo framed the tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a human body, that what is now whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and ſoveraign, might have been poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pernicious; and in this reſpect I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Law of Nature may be ſaid to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend</hi> upon the arbitrary will of God, and to be <hi>mutable</hi> at his pleaſure. But yet it ſtill remains immutably true in the <hi>general,</hi> that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has ſuch a natural ordination to or conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the well or ill being of mankind, is good or evil reſpectively. This is the ſtandard
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95868:123"/>
of morality and immorality, and the eſſential difference between Vertue and Vice. And 'tis as immutably true that ſome <hi>particular</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould have ſuch a natural connexion, <hi>ſtante rerum Hypotheſi,</hi> during the preſent ſtate and order of things. Now whatever has ſo, is an eſſential branch of the Law of Nature, and obliges us to act or not to act reſpectively to the <hi>Term</hi> of its Ordination. So that <hi>Bonum hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum</hi> is that which in the order of things is <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num utile,</hi> and conduces as a <hi>Natural Medium</hi> to Felicity, which is the End of man.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. Hence then it follows, that the Chriſtian Law which is nothing elſe but the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture retriev'd, conſiſts only of ſuch practical maxims, which carry a <hi>natural</hi> relation to the true intereſt and well being of mankind, and conſequently contains nothing in it but what is reaſonable, very reaſonable to be done. But to evince this more particulary 'twill be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to take a curſory view of the Chriſtian Law. And this I ſhall conſider firſt, as I find it ſumm'd up in general by our B. Saviour in anſwer to the Lawyers Queſtion, what he ſhould do to inherit eternal life, and ſecondly, in ſome of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances of it which ſeem <hi>moſt</hi> to croſs the preſent intereſt of mankind.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. As to the Iſt, the ſumme which our B. Saviour gave of it was this: <hi>Thou ſhalt</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 37. Mark 12. 30. Luke 10. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind,</hi>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:95868:124"/>
                        <hi>and thy Neighbor as thy ſelf.</hi> Theſe he told him were the two great Commandments, and that there were none greater than theſe: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none more <hi>reaſonable.</hi> For ſince man is not his own end, but has an <hi>Amorous Principle</hi> within him which tranſports him to good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelf, ſince he is not a <hi>Central</hi> and <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating</hi> Being, but by the weight of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections gravitates and inclines to ſomthing <hi>further,</hi> what is more Reaſonable than that he fix upon <hi>God</hi> as his <hi>Center,</hi> who is as well the <hi>End</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> of his Being? And ſince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever portion of his love is not directed hither, will neceſſarily light (for it cannot be idle, and muſt fix ſomwhere) upon diſproportionate and vain Objects, which neither <hi>deſerve</hi> it nor can <hi>ſatisfy</hi> it, and conſequently will but vex and torment him, what can be more Reaſonable than that he <hi>unite</hi> and <hi>concenter</hi> all the rays of his affection both Intellectual and ſenſitive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and according to the <hi>ſtricteſt</hi> ſenſe of this great Commandment love him with all his heart, Soul and mind? <hi>Viſion</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> make up the full compoſition of our Celeſtial Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereafter, and they are the neareſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach we can make to it here.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Nor is the 2d great Commandment leſs reaſonable than the firſt. The trueſt and moſt effectual way a man can take to love himſelf, is to love his neighbor as himſelf. For ſince man is a neceſſitous and indigent Creature (of all
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95868:124"/>
Creatures the moſt indigent) and ſince he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not upon his own ſolitary ſtock ſupply the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitys of his nature (the want of Society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of them) and ſince of all Creatures here below none is capable of doing him either ſo much <hi>good</hi> or ſo much <hi>harm</hi> as thoſe of his own ſpecies, as 'twill be his beſt <hi>ſecurity</hi> to have as many Friends and as few Enemys as he can, ſo, as a means to this, to hate and injure none, but to love and oblige all, will be his beſt <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> So far is the ſtate of Nature from being (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Elements of the <hi>Leviathan</hi>) a ſtate of Hoſtility and war, that there is no one thing that makes more apparently for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of mankind than univerſal Charity and Benevolence. And indeed, would all men but once agree to eſpouſe one anothers intereſts and proſecute the public good truly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, nothing would be wanting to verify and realize the Dreams of the Golden Age, to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate the <hi>Millennial</hi> Happineſs, and bring down Heaven upon Earth. Society would ſtand firm and compact, like a <hi>Mathematical frame of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture,</hi> ſupported by mutual dependencys and coherences, and every man's kindneſſes would return again upon himſelf in the <hi>Circle</hi> and <hi>Reciprocation</hi> of Love.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. But beſides this Conſideration of <hi>Intereſt,</hi> there is another which equally contributes to recommend this Law of univerſal Benevolence, and perhaps with more ſweetneſs of inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95868:125"/>
than the former, and that is Pleaſure. Theſe two are put together by the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 133. 1.</note> who tells us, that <hi>'tis both good and pleaſant for Brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi> There is certainly a moſt Divine pleaſure in the acts and expreſſes of Benevolence, ſo that if God may be ſaid to take pleaſure in any one thing beſides the richneſs of his own infinity, it muſt be in the <hi>Communication</hi> of it. Sure I am, no man can do good to another without recreating and feaſting his own ſpirit; nay, even the moſt happy and ſelf-ſufficient man who as to his <hi>intereſt</hi> has the leaſt need to be kind and obliging, yet as to his <hi>Pleaſure</hi> has the greateſt. For he enjoys his happy ſtate moſt when he communicates it, and takes a Partner with him into his Paradiſe, and receives a more vigorous joy from the <hi>Reflexion,</hi> than from the <hi>Direct incidency</hi> of his Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. I might here take occaſion to ſhew the Reaſonableneſs of Juſtice and Honeſty, with other particular Branches of this great Law, but the neceſſity of theſe is ſo <hi>notorious</hi> (no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety being able to ſubſiſt without them) and withall ſo <hi>atteſted</hi> by the common vote and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the world (it being the buſineſs of all human Laws, and the end of all Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to engage men to the obſervance of them) that I ſhall not need to make any Plea in their behalf.

conſpicuouſly by its own, I ſhall now proceed to juſtify the Chriſtian Law in ſome of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which ſeem <hi>moſt</hi> to croſs the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of mankind.</p>

But whoever ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the matter will find, that pure and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple revenge is a thing very abſurd, and very productive of ill conſequences, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, worſe than the <hi>firſt</hi> injury. For <hi>that</hi> may have ſome ends of profit and advantage in it, but to do another man a diskindneſs merely becauſe he has done me one, ſerves to no good purpoſe, and to many ill ones.

A ſtrange precept one would think, and highly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to <hi>Reaſon</hi> as well as <hi>Nature.</hi> But whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſiders the great uſefulneſs of Love and Benevolence to the intereſt of Society, will quickly perceive, that he ought not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged from the obſervance of ſo neceſſary a Duty upon ſo ſlight a ground as anothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault in it. I grant 'tis neither Reaſonable nor poſſible to love an enemy for being ſo, (that is no proper motive of love) but yet 'tis very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to love the <hi>man</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>enmity.</hi> Becauſe the neceſſity of Charity is ſo indiſpenſable, that it ought to oblige in <hi>all</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes. And beſides, as by this means all enmity is certainly prevented on one ſide (which is of very great conſideration to the public peace) ſo is it the likelyeſt method to bring over the other.

                     <p n="36">36. There is one inſtance more, wherein the Chriſtian Law ſeems not to conſult the intereſt of human life, and that is in the matter of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,</hi> which our Saviour allows in no caſe but that of Adultery.

For 1ſt, all the ſuppoſable inconveniences of this reſtraint may be in a great meaſure prevented by prudent and wiſe Choice.

over to vertue, is much greater than of thoſe that leave vertue and come over to ſin, (which is the Apology that the Platoniſt <hi>Simplicius</hi> makes for vertue) the Concluſion would be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced beyond the reach of controverſy that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is a <hi>Reaſonable Service,</hi> and that the Precepts of our excellent Lawgiver both begin, continue and end with a <hi>Beatitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="38">38. I can now foreſee but one Objection of any moment which the Argument of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is liable to, which is, that altho vertue and vice have a natural ordination to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Miſery of life reſpectively, yet it may ſo happen by the intervening of ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that this connexion of things may be broken off, and that a man may be a loſer by vertue, and a gainer by vice, as in the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>martyrdom</hi> and <hi>ſecure theft.</hi> And here the Queſtion will be, whether it be then reaſonable to act vertuouſly and unreaſonable to do the contrary. To this I anſwer, 1ſt that it may be juſtly queſtion'd (notwithſtanding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of any accidents) whether a man may be vertuous to his diſadvantage, or vicious to his advantage, even as to <hi>this preſent</hi> ſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the internal ſatisfaction and ácquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, or diſſatisfaction and moleſtation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that attend the practice of vertue and vice reſpectively. But ſuppoſing he may, then 2ly I reply, that here come in the rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of another life to ſupply the natural
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95868:128"/>
ſanction of the law. Then 3ly, to the ſecond inſtance I offer this in peculiar, that altho in ſome circumſtances I might be dishoneſt to my preſent gain, yet 'tis very reaſonable that all ſhould be obliged to the law of Juſtice. Becauſe if every one ſhould be permitted to uſe ſecret Frauds (and all may as well as one) the evil would come about again, even to him whom we juſt now ſuppoſed a gainer by his theft, and as to the public 'twould be all one as if there were no <hi>Property,</hi> and then for want of <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> the final iſſue of the matter would be an utter neglect and diſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Earth, and a continual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the public peace. So that when all's done <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy,</hi> and to live moſt happily is to live moſt vertuouſly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly. So true is that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I ſee that all things come to an end, but thy</hi>

                     <p n="39">39. From what has been hitherto diſcours'd, I ſhall now briefly deduce ſome practical infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and conclude. Since then our Religion is ſo Reaſonable a Service, 'twill follow hence in the firſt place, that there may be a due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in <hi>divine</hi> matters, and that whatſoever is apparently contrary to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ought not to be obtruded as of <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> nor be accounted as any part of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Religion. An Inference wherein the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a little concern'd.</p>
                     <p n="40">
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:95868:129"/>40. 'Twill follow 2ly, that no man ought to be perſecuted, or have any external violence done him for his <hi>Religion,</hi> ſuppoſing that by <hi>overt</hi> acts he give no diſturbance to the <hi>Public.</hi> For ſince God has required nothing of us but what is agreeable to our Reaſon, why ſhould man?</p>
                     <p n="41">41. 'Twill follow 3ly, that ſin is the very Height and Extremity of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Diſingenuity.</hi> Of <hi>Folly,</hi> becauſe it croſſes and defeats the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent end of Man, which is to live happily and commodiouſly. And of <hi>Diſingenuity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis committed againſt him, who when he might by vertue of his ſupream Dominion have impoſed upon us <hi>arbitrary</hi> Laws, (as that given to <hi>Adam</hi>) or <hi>hard</hi> and ſevere ones (as that to <hi>Abraham</hi>) has been graciouſly pleas'd to make nothing the Condition of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but what upon <hi>other</hi> accounts would have been moſt adviſable to be done. This certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will render ſin <hi>exceeding ſinful,</hi> and leave the <hi>ſinner</hi> without the leaſt ſhadow of an excuſe. We commonly derive the aggravations of ſin from the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of God, but without queſtion his <hi>goodneſs</hi> will ſupply us with as many, and in this ſenſe alſo 'twill be true to ſay, <hi>as is his Majeſty, ſo is his Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="42">42. Laſtly hence 'twill follow, that we ought to perform this <hi>Rational</hi> will of God with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> alacrity and conſtancy, partly for its own excellency as 'tis a perſuance of our intereſt,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95868:129"/>
and partly out of gratitude and generoſity to God, for giving us ſuch excellent Laws, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which there is <hi>ſo great Reward.</hi> For not only the <hi>End</hi> of our Religion is Happineſs, but even her <hi>very ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. ALL that is of any moment for the full Diſcharging of this Subject, will be abſolv'd in theſe three Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1ſt, that man has one way or other ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power to perſevere in a courſe of Holineſs if he will; otherwiſe all exhortations would be in <hi>vain.</hi> 2ly, that 'tis alſo poſſible for him to fall from a ſtate of Holineſs; otherwiſe they would all be <hi>ſuperfluous.</hi> And laſtly, by ſhewing him what vaſt encouragements, what infinite engagements he has to ſtand.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I begin with the firſt, that man has one way or other ſufficient power to perſevere in a courſe of Holineſs if he will. Where by <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> I do not underſtand a continuedly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, equal courſe of obedience, and ſuch as is not interrupted with the leaſt act of ſin, (for this is a perfection not to be hoped for, under the <hi>diſadvantages</hi> of <hi>mortality</hi>) but only ſuch a conſtancy of obedience as excludes all <hi>contrary Habits,</hi> and likewiſe all <hi>ſuch acts</hi> of ſin as are
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95868:132"/>
ſaid directly to waſt the Conſcience, thoſe I mean, which are committed againſt the clear and expreſs Dictate either of natural Reaſon, or ſupernatural Revelation. And withall (to compleat the Character) ſuch an Obedience as is attended with a ſedulous care and hearty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to correct and ſubdue even thoſe <hi>pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable</hi> infirmitys, which can never be <hi>wholly</hi> put off in this ſtate, but will always adhere like <hi>ſpots</hi> to the <hi>brighteſt Star</hi> in the <hi>Firmament.</hi> This I conceive to be all one with that diſpoſition of Soul which with more compendiouſneſs we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually call <hi>ſincerity,</hi> in oppoſition to a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>ſinleſs</hi> obedience. Now that man has ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power to perſevere in ſuch a courſe of life as is here deſcribed, (not to call in the aſſiſtance of any other Argument) ſeems to me evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrable from this ſingle conſideration, that to be <hi>found</hi> in the ſtate above mention'd is the condition of the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> upon the fulfilling of which, all our hopes of Pardon and Salvation depend. I do not ſay 'tis the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable Condition of our Salvation, that we perſevere <hi>uninterruptedly</hi> even in this ſtate of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Righteouſneſs</hi> (it being poſſible for a man after an interruption of a ſalvable ſtate to recover into it again, as is plain from the caſe of David, St. Peter and many others) but that we be <hi>found finally</hi> in this ſtate <hi>is</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Salvation. <hi>For if the Righteous man turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and</hi>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:95868:132"/>
                        <hi>committeth iniquitys and dies in them, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mention'd, in the ſin that he hath ſinn'd ſhall he dye.</hi> Well then, if Salvation be not to be had <hi>out</hi> of this ſtate, then it follows, that it muſt never become impoſſible to a man without his own fault to be found <hi>in it,</hi> ſince 'tis repugnant to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Covenant (much more of this great Covenant of <hi>mercy</hi>) to have a condition an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to it, which in <hi>ſome</hi> circumſtances, and that <hi>without our fault</hi> may prove <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Condition then of this new Covenant muſt be as poſſible to man in this ſtate of dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy, now his <hi>locks are ſhaven and his great ſtrength is departed from him,</hi> as the Condition of the firſt Covenant was to him in his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive might and vigour. <hi>Do this and live,</hi> is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly common to both, the only difference lies in the <hi>This</hi> that is to be <hi>done,</hi> not in the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of the <hi>performance.</hi> Or if there are degrees of poſſibility, the advantage ought to lie on this ſide, this being (as was hinted before) a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Well then, if to be found finally in the ſtate above deſcrib'd be the indiſpenſable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Salvation, and if for that very reaſon (as it has been prov'd) it muſt not in any circumſtance become impoſſible without our fault, it unavoidably follows, that 'tis alſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to <hi>perſevere in it without interruption,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe we having not the diſpoſal of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95868:133"/>
our own lives, it will oftentimes prove impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us (and that without our own fault) to be found <hi>finally</hi> in that ſtate which is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Salvation; which is contrary to the ſuppoſition. The ſhort is (to ſpeak all in a word) the poſſibility of being <hi>found</hi> in a ſalvable ſtate cannot be ſufficiently ſecured, without a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of always <hi>perſevering in it,</hi> and therefore I conclude it poſſible for a man to do ſo, which was the thing I undertook to prove.</p>

                     <p n="16">16. But now leſt this poſſibility of falling be reduced to act, I proceed to conſider the vaſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95868:137"/>
encouragements, the infinite engagements that he who is Holy has to be holy ſtill. And theſe I ſhall chuſe to repreſent to him in theſe two general Conſiderations. 1ſt, that he has made the <hi>beſt</hi> choice that he could poſſibly have made, and conſequently, 'tis againſt all the reaſon in the world that he ſhould <hi>reſcind</hi> it. And 2ly, that if notwithſtanding he does reſcind it, he will not only loſe the <hi>advantage</hi> of his beſt choice, but incur an oppoſite portion of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that in a <hi>greater meaſure</hi> than <hi>other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Theſe I take to be the moſt proper Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to inforce the grand Duty of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The conſequence of the firſt Argument proceeds upon this Principle, that that choice which is beſt is not to be reſcinded. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſo evident that it can hardly <hi>admit,</hi> much leſs <hi>need</hi> any proof, and 'tis practically confeſs'd by every man throughout the whole tenour of his life. For no man retracts his choice 'till he has alter'd the Dictate of his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (for otherwiſe he would chuſe evil under the very Formality of evil) and has entertain'd other apprehenſions of the object than he had when he firſt choſe it. And this is that which makes up the entire notion of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is nothing elſe in its <hi>preciſe Idea,</hi> when abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>particular</hi> matter, but a <hi>Retractation</hi> of a former choice, proceeding from the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Practical Dictate, diſallowing that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95868:137"/>
now, which was before approv'd. For this a man never does 'till he thinks he has reaſon to do ſo. And upon this account 'tis, that God is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and cannot properly <hi>repent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his underſtanding being infinite and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out to all the poſſibilitys of things, muſt needs dictate to his will after <hi>one uniform</hi> and conſtant manner, it being impoſſible he ſhould either diſcover ſomthing <hi>afterward</hi> which he did not comprehend at <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>loſe</hi> the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſomthing which he <hi>did.</hi> But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of man being finite and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at the beſt, and oftentimes corrupted and biaſs'd by the Paſſions, has at ſeveral times dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent apprehenſions of things, and being ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>under</hi> and ſomtimes <hi>out of the cloud,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates to the will as the Sun ſhines upon the Earth, with a <hi>diſuniform</hi> and <hi>unequal</hi> light. Whereupon (as it frequently happens in Courts and Senates) many Decrees are enacted, which at the next <hi>Seſſion</hi> are repeal'd again, tho with this unhappineſs, that ſomtimes her ſecond thoughts are worſe than her firſt, and that ſhe ſomtimes retracts that which ſhe ſhould perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in, as well as perſeveres in that which ſhe ſhould retract. But whatever the Retraction <hi>really</hi> be, 'twas always <hi>thought</hi> for the <hi>beſt</hi> when <hi>made,</hi> ſo that he that repents him of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as well as he that repents him of his <hi>ſin,</hi> does it upon the change of his Practical Dictate, judging that not to be beſt now, which before
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95868:138"/>
was ſo pronounc'd, and conſequently, they both own the Truth of the foremention'd Principle, that that choice which is beſt is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. This being firm, all the buſineſs in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion now will be, whether he that is Holy has made the beſt choice or no. And if it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he has, then by the Principle juſt now laid down he ought not, nay he cannot be ſo much a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to himſelf as to reſcind it. Now to convince him that he has made the beſt choice, I deſire him to conſider, 1ſt that he has choſen that which God had choſen for him before, ſo that his choice ſtands recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to him by the <hi>Authority</hi> of infinite and unerring wiſdom. And this is foundation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to warrant a <hi>certain</hi> (tho <hi>implicit</hi>) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that it muſt needs be beſt for him. I ſay beſt for <hi>him,</hi> for God being already poſſeſs'd of all poſſible perfection, cannot act any thing for any <hi>ſelf-advantage,</hi> and therefore whatſoever he does is for the good of his <hi>Creatures.</hi> For there is this difference (as <hi>Divine Plato</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well obſerves) between the <hi>Divine</hi> love and <hi>created</hi> love, that the one ſprings from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digency,</hi> and the other from <hi>fullneſs</hi> and <hi>redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy.</hi> And therefore as God did not at firſt ſpeak this world into being, to raiſe himſelf a monument of <hi>Power</hi> and divine <hi>Architecture,</hi> ſo neither does he govern the <hi>Rational</hi> part of it by the Precepts of Religion out of any <hi>ſelf-deſign,</hi>
                        <pb n="263" facs="tcp:95868:138"/>
as if he feaſted his noſtrils with the perfumes of the Altar, or his ears with the accents of an Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah. <hi>For can a man be profitable to</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>God, as he that is wiſe may be profitable to himſelf? Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makeſt thy way perfect?</hi> No certainly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he chalk'd out the ways of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs for man to walk in, it could not be for any <hi>ſelf end,</hi> but purely for the good of <hi>man,</hi> and conſequently (if infinite wiſdom be to be truſted) it muſt be his beſt choice to be <hi>Holy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. Secondly let him conſider, that the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Religion conſults a man's <hi>whole</hi> intereſt, and partly of its own nature and partly by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſtitution, tends to make him happy in <hi>all</hi> his capacitys, and conſequently muſt needs be his <hi>beſt</hi> choice. As for impious and unjuſt Practiſes, if they do at any time promote a man's <hi>private</hi> and <hi>ſecular</hi> intereſt, yet 'tis always both at the expence of the <hi>public,</hi> and of his own <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> welfare, and then, <hi>what will it profit a man to gain the whole world and loſe his own Soul?</hi> But now this is the peculiar <hi>gain</hi> of <hi>godlineſs,</hi> that it has the promiſe both of this life and of that which is to come, that it conduces to our advantage both <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter. Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> are immediatly link'd together in this life, and every Vertue has a <hi>natural Sanction</hi> of Reward and Puniſhment reſpectively attending
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95868:139"/>
it, as I could eaſily demonſtrate, but that it has been already done by many excellent hands, and particularly with <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dr. Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</note> evidence by a late writer of our own. And altho it happen ſomtimes through the unreaſonableneſs and injuſtice of men that Duty and Intereſt <hi>interfere,</hi> and that Vertue be defeated of the Portion ſhe is <hi>naturally</hi> endow'd with, yet ſhe ſhall recover her own again at the great Aſſize, at the <hi>day of the revelation of the righteous Judgments of God.</hi> And altho inſtead of being <hi>rewarded</hi> it be our fortune to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for righteouſneſs ſake, yet we Chriſtians know that it entitles us to one of our Saviours <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> and we are alſo well aſſured from one whoſe caſe it was to be ſo dealt with, that <hi>the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the preſent time are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory that ſhall be reveal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> So that whatever difficultys and hardſhips Religion may ſomtimes engage a man in, yet when the whole account is caſt up, he will find the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of Religion as <hi>gainful,</hi> as the <hi>belief</hi> of it is <hi>rational,</hi> that to be Holy is his beſt choice, and that he has infinite reaſon to pray in the words of Balaam, <hi>Let me die the death of the Righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:95868:139"/>20. And now one would think, that one who has ſo great and ſo apparent reaſon for his choice as the Religious man has, ſhould not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be brought to retract it, and ſay with thoſe in Malachi, <hi>it is vain to ſerve God, and what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is it that I have kept his ordinances?</hi> But becauſe 'tis obſerv'd to be the Nature of Man to be more ſtrongly affected with <hi>Puniſhments</hi> than <hi>Rewards,</hi> I ſhall for his better eſtabliſhment in the purpoſes of Holineſs preſent him with the 2d general Conſideration, which is, that if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the excellency of his choice he does retract it, he will not only loſe the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages</hi> of it, but alſo incur an <hi>oppoſite portion of miſery,</hi> and that in <hi>greater</hi> meaſures than other ſinners.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. That he will loſe the advantages of his firſt and beſt choice, is plain from the whole te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Goſpel, Perſeverance to the end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expreſs condition of Salvation. And that he will incur an oppoſite portion of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is plain from the double Sanction of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments wherewith God has bound us to the obſervance of his <hi>otherwiſe</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently profitable Laws. And altho this be ſufficient in the ſevereſt trials to preſerve us from <hi>Apoſtaſy,</hi> and when flames of fire ſurround us to ſecure our footing in the <hi>Holy ground,</hi> yet thus far is but to dye the <hi>common death of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to be viſited after the viſitation of the Impenitent. But now if the Lord make a new</hi>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:95868:140"/>
                        <hi>thing,</hi> and the Deſertor of Piety be puniſh'd in a greater meaſure than other ſinners, <hi>then ſhall ye underſtand that this man has provoked the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22. And that he ſhall be ſo puniſh'd is the peculiar conſideration which I ſhall now inſiſt upon, and which I prove from the <hi>heinouſneſs</hi> of his crime, <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> having in it many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of evil beyond the <hi>common</hi> ſtate of ſin. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the Pollutions of the world through the knowledg of the Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning.

SInce the Practice of Religion in general is not only the <hi>Natural Inſtrument</hi> of our <hi>preſent</hi> Happineſs, but alſo the <hi>only</hi> and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſable condition</hi> of our <hi>Future,</hi> one would think there were but little left for the Orator to do here, the naked efficacy of Self-love, and a ſerious conſideration of our true and main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, being ſufficient to engage us upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious performances. But he that ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to recommend the Practice of <hi>Heroic Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> has a much heavier task, not only becauſe he perſwades to <hi>higher</hi> degrees of Vertue, but becauſe he is to addreſs himſelf wholly to a <hi>weaker</hi> Principle. For ſince our <hi>intereſt</hi> is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the performance of <hi>neceſſary</hi> Duty, there remains nothing but a Principle of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity</hi> to carry us on to the higher <hi>advances,</hi> the more glorious <hi>Atchievements</hi> in Religion. And what ſmall probability there is that it will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do ſo, may appear from the ill ſucceſs of the former and more prevailing Principle. For if

the greateſt intereſt imaginable can prevail with ſo very few to perform what is indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary to ſecure it, ſure there is little hopes that <hi>Generoſity,</hi> which is a much <hi>weaker</hi> Principle, ſhould engage <hi>many</hi> upon <hi>greater</hi> performances.</p>

But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for the clearer eviction and ſtronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this Aſſertion, I farther conſider, that the Scripture conſiſts of <hi>Counſels</hi> as<note place="margin">Matt. 19. 20. <hi>and</hi> 21. 1 Cor. 7. 1, 6, 7, 25, 38. 2 Cor. 8. 10. <hi>and</hi> 9. 6.</note> well as <hi>Commands.</hi> Now if ſome things are matter of Counſel onely, 'tis obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to conclude two things. 1.

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95868:147"/>
and ſecondly, from their being <hi>only</hi> counſell'd, that they do not oblige, and conſequently, that there are ſome degrees of good that we are not obliged to.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. It is farther obſervable, that in Scripture there is mention made of a threefold Will of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

Thus for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was an Act of ſtrict Duty which he could not leave undone without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring that woe which he annexes to the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Generoſity, and in that reſpect there was room for boaſting.</hi> Thus again, for a <hi>Jew</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot the tenth part of his Revenue every third year toward the relief of the Poor, was an act of expreſs Duty, and in doing of that, he would but ſatisfie the obligation of the Law; But now if in his charitable contributions he ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that proportion, according to the degrees of the exceſs, ſo would the degrees of his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be. Thus again in the matter of <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> daily Prayer is generally concluded to be a <hi>Duty,</hi> and by ſome <hi>Criticks</hi> that it be <hi>twice</hi> perform'd, in proportion to the returns of the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95868:148"/>
Jewiſh Sacrifices, Morning and Evening; But now if a more generouſly diſpoſed Chriſtian ſhould add a <hi>third</hi> time, or out of <hi>abundance</hi> of zeal ſhould come up to the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s reſolution of <hi>(Seven times a day will I praiſe thee)</hi> this would be a <hi>free-will</hi> Offering, <hi>well pleaſing</hi> and of <hi>ſweet ſavour,</hi> but not <hi>commanded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. From theſe and many other inſtances, which, if neceſſary, I could eaſily produce, it plainly appears that Religion does not conſiſt in an <hi>indiviſible point,</hi> but has a <hi>Latitude,</hi> and is capable of <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs,</hi> and conſequently there is room for <hi>voluntary Oblations</hi> and Acts of <hi>Heroic Piety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. I know it is uſually objected here, that what is ſuppoſed to be thus <hi>Heroically</hi> perform'd, is <hi>incluſively</hi> enjoyn'd by vertue of thoſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive words, (<hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy Soul, &amp;c.</hi>) But, I conceive, that all which is intended by that phraſe, will amount to no more than, Firſt, a <hi>ſincere</hi> love of God, as 'tis oppoſed to that which is <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>divided;</hi> and ſecondly, ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of loving him, as admits of nothing into <hi>Competition</hi> with him. And thus far reach the <hi>Boundaries</hi> of indiſpenſable Duty, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he who does not love God in this <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>degree,</hi> ſhould keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But beyond this, there are higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which, becauſe we may fall ſhort of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin, are the more excellent when attain'd.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95868:148"/>
So that in this Precept of loving God, as in all other inſtances of Religion, there is a great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, it being very poſſible for two Perſons to love God <hi>ſincerely</hi> and with their <hi>whole Soul,</hi> and yet in different meaſures (which is obſerv'd even among the Angels, the <hi>Seraphins</hi> having their name from their <hi>exceſs</hi> of <hi>Love</hi>) nay, for the ſame Perſon always to love God <hi>ſincerely,</hi> and yet at ſome times to exceed himſelf, and with his Saviour (who to be ſure never fail'd of <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> Duty) to <hi>pray yet more earneſtly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. There is another Objection yet behind, which I think my ſelf concern'd to anſwer, as well in my <hi>own</hi> defence as that of my <hi>Argument.</hi> Some perhaps may be ſo weak to imagine, that by aſſerting ſuch a thing as <hi>Heroic Piety,</hi> and that a Chriſtian may do <hi>more</hi> than he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I too much favour the Doctrine of <hi>Supererogation.</hi> But I conſider, that <hi>for a Man to do more than he is commanded,</hi> is an ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſion, and may denote either that he can perform the <hi>whole</hi> Law of God and <hi>more,</hi> or that, tho he fail of his Duty in many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and conſequently with the reſt of Mankind, is <hi>concluded under Sin;</hi> Yet in ſome others he may exceed it, by <hi>preſſing forward</hi> to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of excellency he is not obliged to. I do not aſſert the <hi>former</hi> of theſe, but the <hi>latter.</hi> And I think I have ſufficiently proved, that there are certain degrees in <hi>Religion,</hi> which we are not obliged to under Pain of Sin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:95868:149"/>
that he who arrives ſo far, does (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>latter</hi> notion of the <hi>Phraſe</hi>) do <hi>more then he is commanded.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. Having in the foregoing <hi>Periods</hi> ſtated the Notion of <hi>Heroic Piety,</hi> and demonſtrated that there is ſuch a thing, I proceed now to my third and laſt undertaking, which was to offer ſome Perſwaſives to recommend the Practiſe of it. Firſt then, I conſider that Religion is the Perfection of a Man, the improvement and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of that part of him wherein he reſembles his Maker, the purſuance of his beſt and laſt end, and conſequently his <hi>Happineſs.</hi> And will a man ſet <hi>bounds</hi> to his <hi>Happineſs?</hi> Will he be no more happy than he is <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> no more than what will juſt ſerve to ſecure him from a <hi>miſerable</hi> Eternity? Is not Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deſirable for it <hi>ſelf,</hi> as well as for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Miſery?</hi> Why then do we deal with it as with <hi>dangerous Phyſic,</hi> weighing it by Grains and Scruples and nice Proportions? Why do we drink ſo <hi>moderately</hi> of the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſo <hi>ſparingly</hi> of the <hi>Well</hi> of <hi>Life?</hi> Are we afraid of making too nigh advances to the State of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, of becoming <hi>too</hi> like God, of <hi>antedating</hi> Heaven? Are we affraid our Happineſs will flow in too <hi>thick</hi> upon us, that we ſhall not bear up againſt the Tide, but ſink under the too <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> enjoyment? Hereafter indeed, when we are bleſt with the <hi>Beatific Viſion,</hi> and the Glories of the Divine Brightneſs ſhall flaſh too <hi>ſtrong</hi> upon
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:95868:149"/>
our Souls, ſo that our Happineſs begins to be <hi>leſſen'd</hi> by its <hi>greatneſs;</hi> We may then with the Angels that attend the Throne, <hi>veil</hi> our Faces, and <hi>divert</hi> ſome of the too <hi>exuberant</hi> bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But now in this <hi>Region</hi> we are far enough from being <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Line,</hi> there is no danger of ſuch <hi>Extremity,</hi> but rather the contrary, and therefore it would be now moſt adviſable for us to be as <hi>Happy,</hi> and to that end, as <hi>Religious</hi> as we can.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Secondly, I conſider, that ſince God, out of the abundance of his <hi>overflowing</hi> and <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative</hi> Goodneſs, was pleas'd to create and deſign man for the beſt of Ends, the fruition of himſelf in endleſs Happineſs, and ſince he has preſcribed no other Conditions for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Happineſs; but that we would live happily here in this State of Probation, having made nothing our Duty but what would have been beſt for us to do whether he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it or no, and has thereby declared, that he is ſo far only pleas'd with our Services to <hi>him</hi> as they are beneficial to <hi>our ſelves;</hi> this muſt needs be a moſt endearing engagement to one that has the leaſt ſpark of Generoſity or Ingenuity, to do ſomthing for the ſake of ſo <hi>good</hi> a God, beyond the Meaſures of Neceſſity, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards of his main and final Intereſt. This is the <hi>only Tribute</hi> of Gratitude we are capable of paying God for giving us ſuch good, ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and righteous Laws. Had the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:95868:150"/>
of our eternal welfare been never ſo hard, arbitrary, and contradictory to our preſent Happineſs, yet mere intereſt would engage us to perform <hi>neceſſary Duty,</hi> and ſhall we do no more out of a principle of <hi>Love</hi> to our excellent Lawgiver, for making our <hi>preſent Happineſs</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> of our <hi>future?</hi> Shall the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> conſtrain us to do no more then what we would do <hi>merely</hi> for the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>our ſelves?</hi> ſhall we ſtint our Performances to him, who ſets no Meaſures to his Love of us? Can our Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be ever more ſeaſonably employ'd than in endeavouring to pleaſe him in <hi>extraordinary</hi> Meaſures, whoſe <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is to ſee us <hi>happy</hi> even <hi>while</hi> we <hi>pleaſe</hi> him? For ſo is the will of the wiſe and good Governour of the World, that in ſerving <hi>him</hi> we ſhould ſerve <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and like <hi>Adam</hi> in his dreſſing and cultivation of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, at the ſame time diſcharge the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God ſets us about, and conſult our <hi>own</hi> Convenience: So that it fares with us in our religious Exerciſes as with the Votary that ſacrifices at the Altar, who all the while he <hi>pleaſes</hi> and ſerves his <hi>God, enjoys</hi> the <hi>perfumes</hi> of his <hi>own Incenſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. Thirdly, I conſider, that every man has a reſtleſs Principle of Love implanted in his Nature, a certain <hi>Magnetiſm</hi> of Paſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (according to the <hi>Platonic</hi> and true notion of Love) he continually aſpires to ſomthing more excellent than himſelf, either really or
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:95868:150"/>
apparently, with a deſign and inclination to perfect his Being. This affection and diſpoſition of Mind <hi>all</hi> Men have, and at <hi>all</hi> times. Our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſions ebb and flow like the Tide, have their Seaſons and Periods like <hi>intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> But this of Love is as conſtant as our <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> heat, as inſeparable as <hi>thought,</hi> as even and equal as the Motions of Time. For no man does or can deſire to be happy more at one time than at another, becauſe he deſires it always in the higheſt degree <hi>poſſible.</hi> 'Tis true, his Love, as to particular objects, may increaſe or decreaſe, according to the various apprehenſions he has of their excellencies; but then, like <hi>Motion</hi> in the Univerſe, what it loſes in one part it gains in another; ſo that in the whole it remains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike, and the ſame. Now this <hi>Amorous</hi> Principle which every man receives with his Soul, and which is breath'd into him with the breath of Life, muſt neceſſarily have an object about which it may exerciſe it ſelf, there being no ſuch thing in <hi>Love</hi> (if in <hi>Nature</hi>) as an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Self-ſufficient</hi> Fire. For tho we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and truly frame an abſtract notion of Love or Deſire in <hi>general,</hi> yet if we reſpect its <hi>real</hi> exiſtence, we ſhall as ſoon find <hi>Firſt Matter</hi> without <hi>Form,</hi> as <hi>Love</hi> without a particular <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> And, as 'tis neceſſary to the very being of Love that it have an object, ſo is it to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and happineſs, that it be a proportionate and ſatisfying one; for otherwiſe that paſſion
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:95868:151"/>
which was intended as an inſtrument of <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> will prove an <hi>affliction</hi> and <hi>torment</hi> to us. Now there is but one ſuch object to be found, and that is God. In the application of our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to other things, the advice of the Poet is exceeding neceſſary,</p>
                     <q>Quicquid amas cupias non placuiſſe nimis. <hi>Martial.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That we ſhould be very cautious how far we ſuffer our ſelves to be engaged in the love of any thing,</hi> becauſe there is nothing but <hi>diſappointment</hi> in the <hi>enjoyment,</hi> and <hi>uncertainty</hi> in the <hi>poſſeſſion.</hi> We muſt needs therefore be miſerable in our Love, unleſs God be the object of it. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our happineſs ſufficiently ſecured by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> the object of our Love, unleſs we <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center</hi> our whole affections upon him, and (in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the Phraſe) <hi>love him with all our Heart and with all our Soul.</hi> For otherwiſe, whatever portion of our Love does not run in this Channel, muſt neceſſarily fix upon diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate and unſatisfying objects, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be an inſtrument of diſcontent to us. 'Tis neceſſary therefore to the compleating of our happineſs, that that object ſhould <hi>engroſs</hi> all our affections to it ſelf, which only can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them; and (according to the<note place="margin">Marſilius Ficinus, Tom. 2. pag. 315.</note> compariſon of an ingenious <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt</hi>) that our minds ſhould have the ſame habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:95868:151"/>
to God that the Eye has to Light. Now the Eye does not only love Light above other things, but <hi>delights</hi> in nothing elſe. I confeſs, ſuch an <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>entire Dedication</hi> of our love to God as this, is not always practicable in this Life. It is the priviledg and happineſs of thoſe <hi>confirm'd</hi> Spirits who are ſo ſwallow'd up in the <hi>Comprehenſions</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and ſo perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually raviſh'd with the Glories of the Divine Beauty, that they have not the <hi>power</hi> to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to any <hi>other</hi> object. But tho this Superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Excellency of Divine Love be not attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on this ſide of the <hi>thick darkneſs,</hi> it being the proper effect of <hi>open Viſion,</hi> and not of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation;</hi> yet however, by the help of this latter, we may arrive to many degrees of it, and the more entire and undivided our love is to God, the fewer diſappointments and diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we ſhall meet with in the World, which is a very ſtrong engagement to <hi>Heroie Piety.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. Fourthly, I conſider, that the degrees of our <hi>Reward</hi> ſhall be proportionable to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of our <hi>Piety:</hi> We ſhall reap as plentifully as we ſow, and at the great day of Retribution, we ſhall find, that beſides the general <hi>Collation</hi> of Happineſs, peculiar Coronets of Glory are prepared for <hi>Eminent</hi> Saints.

                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. Fifthly, and laſtly, I conſider, that We have indeed but very little time to ſerve God in. The Life of man at longeſt is but ſhort, and conſidering how ſmall a part of it we <hi>live,</hi> much <hi>ſhorter.</hi> If we <hi>deduct</hi> from the <hi>Computation</hi> of our Years (as we muſt do, if we will take a true eſtimate of our Life) that part of our time which is ſpent in the incogitancy of Infancy and Childhood, the impertinence and heedleſneſs of Youth, in the neceſſities of Nature, Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, and other Refreſhments; in buſineſs and worldly Concerns, engagements with Friends and Relations, in the offices of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and mutual intercourſe; beſides a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95868:152"/>
other unneceſſary avocations: we ſhall find that there is but a ſmall portion left even for the Retirements of Study, for our improvement in Arts and Sciences, and other intellectual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. But then if we conſider what great <hi>disburſements</hi> of our time are made upon <hi>them</hi> alſo, we ſhall find that Religion is <hi>crowded</hi> up into a very <hi>narrow compaſs;</hi> ſo narrow, that were not the rewards of Heaven matter of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revelation,</hi> 'twould be the greateſt <hi>Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> imaginable to hope for them upon the condition of ſuch <hi>inconſiderable</hi> Services. Since then our time of ſerving God is ſo very ſhort, ſo infinitely diſproportionate to the rewards we expect from him, 'tis but a reaſonable piece of ingenuity to work <hi>with all our might,</hi> and do as much in it as we can: to ſupply the <hi>poverty</hi> of Time by <hi>frugal</hi> management and <hi>intenſeneſs</hi> of affection, to ſerve God <hi>earneſtly, vigorouſly,</hi> and <hi>zealouſly;</hi> and in one days Devotion to <hi>abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate</hi> the <hi>ordinary</hi> Piety of <hi>many years.</hi> 'Tis ſaid of the Devil, that he proſecuted his malicious deſigns againſt the Church with greater<note place="margin">Rev. 12. 12.</note> earneſtneſs and vigour, becauſe <hi>he knew he had but a ſhort time.</hi> And ſhall not the ſame conſideration prevail with a <hi>generous</hi> Soul to do as much for God and Religion, as the Devil did <hi>againſt</hi> them?

                        <p n="1">1. IN the Depth of Solitude and Silence, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withdrawn my ſelf not only from all worldly Commerce, but from all thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any thing without my own Sphere; I retire wholly into my ſelf, and there ſpeculate the Compoſition of my <hi>Intellectual</hi> nature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And here beſides that faculty of <hi>Perception</hi> whereby I apprehend objects, whether Material or Immaterial, without any Material ſpecies; (which in the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Dialect I call <hi>Pure Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>) and that other of apprehending objects as preſent, under a corporeal image or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; (which I diſtinguiſh from the other power of Perception by the name of <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) I ſay, beſides theſe two, I obſerve an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive</hi> Faculty, whereby I incline to Apparent good; and that either by a <hi>bare</hi> act of <hi>Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> or endeavour to unite with the agreeable object; which anſwers to Pure Intellect, and may be call'd <hi>Will</hi> or rather <hi>Volition</hi>) or by ſuch a propenſion of the Soul as is alſo accompany'd with a Commotion of the Blood and Spirits; which anſwers to Imagination, and is the ſame with the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="296" facs="tcp:95868:155"/>3. And of this I further meditate, and by ſelf reflexion experiment, that altho the <hi>Perceptive</hi> Faculty be not always in actual exerciſe, or at leaſt not in the ſame degree of it. (For, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Hypotheſis there be no intermiſſion of Cogitation, yet 'tis moſt certain that its applications are not always equal and uniform) tho this I ſay be true as to the <hi>Perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive;</hi> yet, I find by attending to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my nature, that the <hi>Appetitive</hi> faculty is not only always in Act, but in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of intenſion and Application. As it never has any total intermiſſion, ſo neither is it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (as indeed every thing elſe in man is) to <hi>ebbs</hi> and <hi>flows,</hi> but acts <hi>uniformly</hi> as well as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</hi> This Amorous <hi>Biaſs</hi> and Endeavour of the Soul is like that ſtock of Motion which the <hi>French</hi> Philoſopher ſuppoſes the Univerſe at firſt endow'd with, which continues always at the ſame rate, not to be abated or increas'd. Not that this equality of Love is to be underſtood in reference to <hi>particular</hi> objects, any more than that of Motion in reference to particular Bodyes; but only, that it gains in one part, as much as it loſes in another, ſo as in the <hi>whole</hi> to remain equal and uniform.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. For however various and inconſtant I may be in my love of particular objects, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the various apprehenſion I have of their reſpective excellencyes; yet certainly I perſue <hi>Happineſs</hi> in <hi>general</hi> with the ſame earneſtneſs
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95868:155"/>
and vigour, and do not love or <hi>wiſh well</hi> to my ſelf more at one time, than at another.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And indeed ſince all my inconſtancy in the proſecution of particular objects proceeds from the variety of my Apprehenſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Excellency; and the only reaſon why I withdraw my Affection from this or that thing is, becauſe I diſcern or ſuſpect that Happineſs not to be there which I expected, it is hence plainly argued <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> that I ſtand at all times equally affected towards Happineſs it ſelf. As he that is therefore only variouſly affected toward the means according as he variouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends their ſerviceableneſs to the End, may be truly ſaid to affect the End it ſelf always alike.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Nor can it poſſibly be otherwiſe than that I ſhould thus point at Happineſs with an equal <hi>Verticity;</hi> becauſe I always affect it in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree that is poſſible, which admits of no <hi>Latitude.</hi> For I conſider my ſelf here as a <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Agent,</hi> and accordingly as ſuch can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuſpend the whole Act, nor any one degree of it, but muſt needs operate to the utmoſt ſtretch of my Power. This <hi>Spring</hi> of my Soul (my Appetitive Faculty) is always at its <hi>full bent,</hi> and accordingly preſſes and endeavours with its whole <hi>Elaſticity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. For ſince Good or Happineſs is the <hi>utmoſt</hi> object of my <hi>Appetitive,</hi> it muſt needs employ its <hi>whole</hi> Power, otherwiſe ſo much of it as is
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:95868:156"/>
not in act will be for ever uncapable of being ſo; (there being nothing left beyond that to bring it into act) and conſequently will be planted in me in vain, which I think abſurd to admit; and therefore find it neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that my Appetitive is wholly employ'd in the love of Happineſs; or that I always love it to the utmoſt capacity of my faculty.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Since therefore I find in my ſelf an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive Faculty which is always in actual exerciſe, and that after an even and equal meaſure; and not only ſo, but alſo in the very Height of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and <hi>Invigoration;</hi> I am by the clue of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation further led to conclude, that there muſt be ſome <hi>Center</hi> for this <hi>Weight;</hi> ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or other, either within or without me, of ſuch ample, copious and ſolid excellence as may anſwer to the full extent of my deſires, bear the whole <hi>ſtreſs</hi> of my inclining Soul, and ſuch as may well deſerve to be call'd the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. For I cannot think it any way conſiſtent with the goodneſs of that great Being which call'd me out of the womb of Nothing to what I am, to plant in me ſuch an <hi>Amorous</hi> Principle which at no time lies <hi>Dormant,</hi> but is always <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually</hi> awake, and acting with the utmoſt ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of its vigour, ſuppoſing there were no proportionable object in the whole <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>Entity</hi> for it to fix and bottom upon. It being only a greater preparation and qualification for miſery to have inlarged Faculties and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95868:156"/>
when there is nothing to afford them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſatisfaction. Which however ſome may be juſtly ſubjected to for their <hi>after-deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> can yet never be reaſonably ſuppos'd to be the <hi>Antecedent</hi> will of God.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. And this I am further induced to believe, when I conſider how the great Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made proviſion for the entertainment of our animal Faculties and particular Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites: All our ſenſes, Seeing, Hearing, Taſting, Smelling and Touching, have their proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and opportunities of pleaſure reſpectively. Which makes it very unlikely that our <hi>great</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Appetite of being <hi>Happy,</hi> ſhould be the only one that is <hi>diſinherited</hi> and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. Eſpecially conſidering that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment and indulgence of any of the reſt is then only and in ſuch inſtances and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſtrain'd, when the greater intereſts of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs are thereby croſs'd and defeated. Which argues, that the true Happineſs of Man is the thing chiefly regarded by God; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that there is a Proviſion for that <hi>great</hi> Appetite of his of being <hi>Happy,</hi> as well as for any of the <hi>reſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. Which is yet further confirm'd to me, when I conſider, that there is an <hi>exemplification</hi> of it in the <hi>material</hi> part of the univerſe. The moſt ponderous Body that is has its Center to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which it always preſſes, and in which it ſettles with full acquieſcence. Now ſince there
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:95868:157"/>
is ſomthing in Spiritual Beings which corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds to <hi>weight</hi> in Bodies, (according to that of St. <hi>Auſtin, Amor tuus eſt Pondus tuum</hi>) the Analogy of the thing perſwades me to think that there is alſo ſomthing which ſhall be to them in the nature of a <hi>Center.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">12. And as the contrary is inconſiſtent with the Divine <hi>goodneſs,</hi> ſo neither can I reconcile it to the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of him who made all things in <hi>Number, Weight</hi> and <hi>Meaſure,</hi> to be ſo much out in his <hi>Proportions</hi> as to create an Appetite too high, vigorous, and craving, for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and fullneſs of any object. This would be like making a Body too heavy for the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral</hi> Poiſe; or as if the <hi>Spring</hi> of a Watch ſhould be made too ſtrong for the <hi>wheel,</hi> or any other ſuch diſproportionate operations: which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comports with the <hi>Geometry</hi> of the Divine <hi>Mind,</hi> nor with the exact Harmony of his <hi>other works.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. The <hi>Concluſion</hi> therefore from theſe <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> is, that Man is not as a Body for ever, roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in an Infinite vacuity; or as a Needle continually <hi>trembling</hi> for an <hi>embrace:</hi> but that he has his proper <hi>end</hi> and <hi>Center;</hi> to which 'tis poſſible for him to arrive, and in which as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him when once arrived, not fully to Acquieſce.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. BEing from my <hi>yeſterdays</hi> Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Intellectual Nature, and the ſtock of deſires therein implanted, led to this <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that 'tis neceſſary man ſhould have ſome end; I now conſider that 'tis but to carry on the thred of the ſame Contemplation a little further, and 'twill as evidently appear, that 'tis impoſſible man ſhould be his own end.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For while I ſtand fix'd in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my ſelf, I obſerve that I have this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive</hi> Principle, not only in ſuch a manner as anſwers to <hi>Weight</hi> in Bodies, but alſo ſo as to be analogous to <hi>gravitation,</hi> that is, to Weight not only <hi>in actu primo,</hi> but <hi>in actu ſecundo,</hi> as it denotes ſuch an inclination of Body whereby not only one part preſſes againſt another, but whereby the whole leans and endeavours to ſomthing beyond the bounds of its own <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. For beſides Acts of <hi>ſelf-complacency,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I delight and pleaſe my ſelf in the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of my Nature, and turn as it were upon my own <hi>Axis;</hi> I find in me a great deal of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatical</hi> Love, which continually carryes me out
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95868:158"/>
to good without my ſelf; which I endeavour to cloſe and unite with, in hopes of bettering my preſent ſtate, and of ſupplying from <hi>without</hi> what I ſeek, but cannot find <hi>within.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Hence therefore I conclude that I am not (whatever complacencies I may ſomtimes take in my ſelf) a <hi>Central</hi> or <hi>ſelf-terminative</hi> Being, it being as impoſſible that what is ſo ſhould love any thing <hi>without,</hi> (as love is taken for <hi>Deſire</hi> or Aſpiring to good) as that a Body ſhould gravitate in the <hi>Center.</hi> That which loves any thing <hi>without,</hi> wants ſomthing <hi>within.</hi> If therefore I <hi>gravitate</hi> I am off from the <hi>Center,</hi> conſequently not my <hi>own</hi> Center.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. And that I cannot ever Center in my ſelf and be my own End, is yet further evidenc'd to me, when I contemplate the great <hi>Diſproportion</hi> between my <hi>Appetitive</hi> and all my <hi>other Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> whether of Body or of Mind. I deſire both more <hi>kinds</hi> of pleaſure than they all can afford, and more <hi>Degrees</hi> of pleaſure in the ſame kind. Which muſt neceſſarily be, becauſe my Deſires are extended to <hi>all poſſible</hi> good, but my reall endowments and perfections are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort of that extent. And by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, my Deſires cannot be <hi>cramp'd</hi> within the narrow bounds of my own Sphere, but will of neceſſity run out farther, even as far as there is good without it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. And as there is a manifeſt diſproportion between my ſtock of <hi>ſelf-perfection</hi> and my <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive,</hi>
                           <pb n="304" facs="tcp:95868:159"/>
as to its <hi>objective</hi> Latitude (viz.) the <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of Happineſs; ſo is there no leſs as to the <hi>intenſeneſs</hi> of its Acts. This Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive of mine (as was remark'd in the preceding Contemplation) is always in an <hi>equal</hi> invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and burns with an even and uniform heat; but I have not within my ſelf <hi>fuel</hi> enough to maintain this flame in an equal height. I always equally <hi>deſire,</hi> but I am not always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually <hi>deſirable:</hi> partly becauſe I am ſomtimes (even in my own partial judgment) in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of leſs excellence both as to my Morals and Intellectuals than at other times; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the ſtock of my Perfections tho 'twere poſſible they could be always alike as my <hi>Deſires</hi> are, yet being both <hi>Finite</hi> in Nature; and <hi>Few</hi> in Number, cannot bear a long and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted enjoyment, and appear ſtill equally grateful under it, any more than a ſhort Poem tho in it <hi>ſelf equally</hi> excellent, can <hi>pleaſe</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after a Million of Repetitions.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Hence it comes to paſs, that I do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take an equal Complacency in my ſelf, but am oftentimes (eſpecially after long retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) apt to be melancholy and to grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my own company; ſo that I am fain to lay aſide my ſelf (as it were) for a while, and relieve the <hi>penury</hi> of Solitude with the variety of Company, and ſo <hi>whet</hi> my appetite toward my ſelf as I do toward my meat, by <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>abſtemiouſneſs.</hi>

                           <pb n="305" facs="tcp:95868:159"/>8. Since therefore I always deſire equally, but not my <hi>ſelf;</hi> (being not upon the two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts before mention'd always equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable) it follows, that the ſteddineſs and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this my Flame muſt depend upon ſome <hi>other</hi> Fuel, good which is <hi>without</hi> me.

                        <p n="9">9. And that what this great Enquirer after Happineſs experimented is every mans caſe, I am further aſſured, when I contemplate that the greateſt Favorites of Fortune, thoſe who have had the world at command, and could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all that is good in it with almoſt as little trouble as 'twas created, at a <hi>words ſpeaking,</hi> have yet all along been ſubject to melancholy, eſpecially after ſome notable enjoyment, as the <hi>Grecian Hero</hi> wept when he had conquer'd the world. Now what ſhould the cauſe of this be, but that they find themſelves empty in the midſt of their fullneſs; that they <hi>Deſire</hi> further than they <hi>enjoy;</hi> that however every ſenſe about them be feaſted to the Height, yet their remains a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Appetite, that of being <hi>Happy,</hi> which is not ſatisfy'd; and not only ſo, but becauſe they
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:95868:162"/>
ſuſpect withall (as indeed they have very good reaſon, having taſted the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of Natures en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment) that it <hi>never ſhall</hi> be. And from this <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Deſpair</hi> proceeds their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and dejection of Spirit. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I call to mind a very remarkable ſtory recorded by <hi>Euſebius Nierembergius,</hi> in his book <hi>De Arte Voluntatis,</hi> concerning an Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern<note place="margin">lib. 6. p. 537.</note> Emperour, who was minded to try the ſame experiment upon his ſon as <hi>Solomon</hi> did upon himſelf, and to ſee how far the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations of Life might go towards true Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. He accordingly train'd him up from his infancy in magnificent Apartments, ſtudiouſly remov'd from him all pitiable objects that he might not have ſo much as a <hi>Notion</hi> of miſery, humour'd him in every Punctilio, and furniſh'd him with whatſoever he either did wiſh for, or might be ſuppos'd to take pleaſure in; till at length the <hi>unfortunately</hi> Happy young man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving himſelf to be ſtill in <hi>Deſires,</hi> and that in a ſtate of all poſſible worldly affluence, could no longer flatter himſelf with <hi>imaginary</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but concluded that no condition would ever mend the matter, and ſo fell into extreme Melancholy and Deſpair.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Now I conſider, that if <hi>mean</hi> Perſons on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were ſubject to Melancholy, the <hi>Deſire</hi> from whence it proceeded might be accounted for another way; namely, from their not having ſo <hi>much</hi> of <hi>created</hi> good as if <hi>poſſeſs'd</hi> might be
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:95868:163"/>
thought ſufficient to ſatisfy. But when men that ſit on the top of Fortune's wheel, and drink at the <hi>head fountains</hi> of Nature, are yet liable to melancholy dejections, 'tis to me a plain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that the cauſe of this melancholy, their <hi>Deſires,</hi> proceeds from a <hi>Deficiency</hi> in the <hi>things themſelves;</hi> not that they are ſtraitned in their <hi>poſſeſſions,</hi> but that the <hi>things</hi> which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs are <hi>weigh'd in the Ballance and found wanting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. Thus far is this Truth atteſted to by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi> But I am yet further aſſured of it when I compare the Aſpirations of my Nature with the goodneſs of the Creation; for when I do ſo, I find they are very <hi>diſproportionate.</hi> 'Twas a Celebrated Problem among the ancient Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts, what was the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> thing, what the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> and what the <hi>greateſt?</hi> Concerning which 'twas thus determin'd, that the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> thing was <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> was <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> was the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man. And well may that be call'd the greateſt thing whoſe capacity can take in the whole Creation, and yet like the <hi>immenſe ſpace,</hi> remain ſtill an <hi>unrepleniſh'd</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. For my Deſires are circumſcribed with no limits, but run on indefinitely to all poſſible good. But now the <hi>good</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> like the Creation it ſelf, is <hi>bounded;</hi> the very notion of a <hi>Creature</hi> involving <hi>imperfection,</hi> as much as <hi>Body</hi> does <hi>Circumſcription</hi> and termination. Hence therefore I conclude, that not only all
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:95868:163"/>
the good of the Creation tho collected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>Extract</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> of its great Author, would be inſufficient to afford me perfect Satisfaction; but that 'tis not in the <hi>Power</hi> of him that is <hi>Omnipotent</hi> to Create any good that can ſatisfy my Deſires, any more than to create a Body that ſhall fill Immenſe ſpace.

                        <p n="2">2. For what man of <hi>thoughts</hi> is there, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thorough Conviction that he can neither get <hi>rid</hi> of his deſires, nor among the Proviſions of Nature have them fully <hi>gratify'd,</hi> would not
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:95868:165"/>
immediatly throw up his Title to Immortality, if he thought himſelf arriv'd to the <hi>Meridian</hi> of his Happineſs, and that he muſt never expect to be in a better Condition than he is?

                        <p n="3">3. But to our great Conſolation 'tis wholly in our own power whether it ſhall be <hi>always</hi> ſo with us, or no. There is a Being whoſe <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> are anſwerable to our <hi>Deſires.</hi> He that made us can ſatisfy every Appetite he has plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us, and he that is Happy in <hi>reflecting</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf can make us ſo too, by the <hi>direct</hi> view of his Glory.

                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. But to evince more particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly that God is the true End of man, I ſhall conſider, whether the conditions requiſite to his being ſo are found in him. Now theſe can be no other than theſe two in general, 1ſt, that he be abſolutely good and perfect in himſelf, ſo as to be <hi>able</hi> to fill and ſatisfy the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of our Deſires; and 2ly, that he be <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> that man ſhall partake of this his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95868:165"/>
Fullneſs, ſo as actually one time or other to fix the weight of his Appetite and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Center. If therefore theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are found in God, he has all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make him our End. And that they are, is now to be made appear.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Firſt then, that God is abſolutely good and perfect in himſelf, ſo as to be able to fill and ſatisfy the whole capacity of our deſires. There are ſeveral Topics in the <hi>Metaphyſics</hi> from whence I might infer this, but I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my preſent ſpeculation to this one, that God is the <hi>Firſt Being.</hi> This is a very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poſtulatum; it being too obvious to need any proof, that there is a Firſt Being, or, that by the Firſt Being is meant God. It remains therefore, that we try what advantage may be made of it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. When therefore I conſider God as the <hi>Firſt Being,</hi> I am from thence in the firſt place led to conclude, that he has <hi>eminently</hi> and in a moſt excellent manner in himſelf all kinds and degrees of perfection, that exiſt looſely and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately in all ſecond Beings. And that, not only becauſe the Effect cannot poſſibly exceed the vertue of the cauſe, any more than it can proceed from no cauſe: (which is the ground <hi>Carteſius</hi> builds upon, when he proves the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of God from the <hi>objective</hi> reality of his Idea) but becauſe I further obſerve that in the <hi>Scale</hi> of Being all <hi>aſcenſion</hi> is by <hi>addition,</hi> and,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:95868:166"/>
that what is diſpers'd in the Inferiour, is collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that after a more excellent manner, in the Superiour. Thus in Vegetables there is bare life, in Senſitives Vegetative life and ſenſe, in Rationals Vegetative life ſenſe and reaſon: and all this either formally or eminently with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence in Angels. And ſince there is ſuch an Harmonical <hi>Subordination</hi> among ſecond Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo that the Superiour contains all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Inferiour, with a peculiar excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of its own ſuperadded; I think I have fair grounds to conclude, that the abſolutely Firſt Being has in his rich Eſſence all the ſcatter'd excellencies of the ſubordinate ones in a more perfect manner than they <hi>themſelves</hi> have, with ſome peculiar excellence of his own beſides.</p>
                        <p>Now tho a Being thus <hi>accumulatively</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and excellent, would be beyond all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, great and glorious, and would employ an Eternity in <hi>Contemplation</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> we have yet ſeen but an <hi>Arme</hi> of this <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Beauty,</hi> and been enlightned only with the <hi>Back-parts</hi> of his Glory. For if God be the Firſt <hi>Being,</hi> as is here ſuppoſed, I may further conclude that he is alſo the Firſt <hi>Good:</hi> (<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> being convertible, and every thing having ſo much Good in it as it has of Entity and no more) and if he be the Firſt Good, I cannot ſee how this Concluſion can be avoided, that he is <hi>Infinitely Good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="319" facs="tcp:95868:166"/>8. For I conſider, that the Firſt Good can have no <hi>Cauſe</hi> of that Goodneſs which it has: otherwiſe, it being neceſſary that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of Good ſhould be <hi>Good,</hi> it would not be the <hi>Firſt.</hi> And if the Firſt Good can have no cauſe of its Goodneſs, it can likewiſe have no cauſe of the <hi>Termination</hi> of it, ſince what has no cauſe <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> and <hi>ſimply,</hi> cannot have a cauſe in any particular <hi>reſpect;</hi> and if it has no cauſe of its Termination it muſt neceſſarily be <hi>interminate</hi> or infinite, and Conſequently God, who is the <hi>Firſt</hi> Good, is <hi>infinitely</hi> Good.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. And now breath a while my Soul; and conſider what a rich <hi>Mine</hi> of Good thou haſt <hi>Sprung.</hi> Thou haſt found out a Being, who is not only the <hi>Ideal</hi> as well as <hi>Efficient</hi> cauſe of all created excellence; but who is <hi>Infinitely</hi> Good and excellent.

                        <p n="12">12. Nor does the Superlative eminency of the Divine nature only argue him to be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative,</hi> but to be the <hi>Moſt</hi> Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Selfdiffuſive of all Beings. For, as all <hi>Kinds,</hi> ſo all <hi>degrees</hi> of excellency muſt of neceſſity be included in a Being abſolutely and infinitely perfect, ſuch as God is. Whence it will alſo follow, that he is not only the moſt Communicative of all Beings, but that he will alſo Communicate <hi>himſelf:</hi> and not only ſo, but in ſuch an <hi>ample</hi> and liberal meaſure too, as entirely to ſatisfy the moſt aſpiring &amp; reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Appetite of man; Since Otherwiſe ſome
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:95868:167"/>

Eſpecially conſidering, that thoſe importunate deſires of Human nature are of his <hi>own</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which as it firmly aſſures us of his being <hi>able,</hi> ſo is it no leſs cogent an Argument for his being <hi>willing</hi> to be our Center; it being incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that ſo infinite an Excellence ſhould plant in man ſuch deſires, as either he <hi>could not</hi> or <hi>would not</hi> ſatisfy.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. And of this willingneſs of God that man ſhould partake of his <hi>fullneſs,</hi> ſo far as to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom upon it, and acquieſce in it, there is yet further aſſurance from many expreſs <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of his good pleaſure to that purpoſe. Which conſiſt of two kinds, expreſs <hi>words,</hi> wherein he profeſſes himſelf paſſionately deſirous of the Salvation and happineſs of man; and two very notable and ſignal <hi>Acts;</hi> namely, the conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world a copy of his Will, as a <hi>Chart</hi> to direct us to the true Haven of <hi>Reſt</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage;</hi> and the ſending his Beloved Son from the manſions of glory to diſlodge the angry Guardian of Paradiſe, and re-open for us an Entrance into the <hi>joy of our Lord.</hi> By both which kinds of revelation he has given us the higheſt aſſurance imaginable, that he deſigns not to <hi>engroſs</hi> and monopolize the Perfections of his rich eſſence, but that he is heartily willing to admit man to a <hi>participation</hi> of that excellent
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95868:168"/>
good, wherein he himſelf is Happy; to give him (as the Pſalmiſt expreſſes it) <hi>everlaſting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and make him glad with the joy of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi>

                        <p n="14">14. To which Conſiderations I might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add, that this excellent communicative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Divine nature is typically repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and myſteriouſly exemplify'd by the <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Scale of Being.

The inferiour, which are either matter, or complicated and twiſted with matter, are more contracted, narrow, ſelfiſh and illiberal; but the ſuperiour as they are leſs immers'd in and allay'd with matter, ſo are they more open, diffuſive and free. For indeed all contraction and conſinement is from <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but 'tis <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> that is the Root of all freeneſs and inlargement. And thus we ſee in bodys; the more of kin they are to Spirit in ſubtilty and refinement, the more <hi>ſpreading</hi> are they and <hi>ſelf-diffuſive.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Light,</hi> which of all Bodys is neareſt ally'd to Spirit, is alſo moſt diffuſive and ſelf-communicative.

But tho the <hi>Pathetic</hi> part of man be one of the nobleſt perfections he is furniſh'd with, yet ſo generally faulty are we in the due appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and direction of this noble faculty, that to be pathetically and amorouſly diſpos'd is lookt upon by ſome not as a <hi>Perfection</hi> but as a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> of the Soul, and is condemn'd by a whole order of men as inconſiſtent with the Character of wiſdom, according to that Stoical Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, <hi>Amare ſimul &amp; ſapere ipſi Jovi non datur.</hi>

of his ſeduction; and our Paſſions were given us to perfect and accompliſh our natures, tho by accidental miſapplications to unworthy objects they may turn to our degradation and dishonour. We may indeed be <hi>debaſed</hi> as well as <hi>innobled</hi> by them, but then the fault is not in the large <hi>Sails,</hi> but in the ill <hi>conduct</hi> of the <hi>Pilot,</hi> if our Veſſel miſs the Haven.

                        <p n="4">4. Being therefore from the foregoing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods arrived to this Concluſion, that God is the true End and Center of man, I think I ought now to let looſe the reins of my affections, to <hi>unbay</hi> the current of my Paſſion, and love on without any other boundary or meaſure than what is ſet me by the finiteneſs of my natural powers.</p>
                        <p n="5">5.

                        <p n="6">6. But how excellent a Vertue ſoever <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> may be in our concernments with other objects, we have nothing to do with it in the love of that Being who is our End and Center. There is here danger but of <hi>one Extreme,</hi> and that is of the <hi>defect.</hi> We can love but finitely when we have lov'd our utmoſt; and what is that to him who is infinitely lovely? Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our moſt liberal proportions will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort and ſcanty, we ought not ſure to give <hi>new retrenchments</hi> to our love, and cut it yet ſhorter by <hi>frugal</hi> limitations.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. For if God be our End and Center he muſt neceſſarily have all that good in him which we can poſſibly deſire; and if ſo, then he is able to ſtay and ſatisfy all our Love; and if ſo, then nothing ſo reaſonable as that he ſhould have it all.

the Creature as is poſſible. For ſo alſo 'tis to be obſerv'd in nature, that not only all weight or <hi>Pondus</hi> tends toward the Center, but that alſo it moves thither as nigh as it can in a <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>perpendicular</hi> line.</p>

                        <pb n="339" facs="tcp:95868:176"/>8. And in the third place I ſhall conſider the Abſurdities and ill Conſequences of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing this <hi>Standard,</hi> whereby it ſhall appear how highly reaſonable this <hi>Admonition</hi> of the Apoſtle is, and ſo conclude with a practical Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the whole in relation to our ſelves, and the preſent occaſion.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. I begin with the firſt Propoſition, <hi>That we are not at our own liberty to entertain what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions we pleaſe concerning our ſelves, but that we ought to regulate them by ſome Standard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Acts of the <hi>underſtanding</hi> are by ſome men thought as free from all <hi>Law</hi> as the Acts of the <hi>will</hi> are from all <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they give every one a <hi>Toleration</hi> to <hi>abound in his own ſenſe</hi> and (provided his <hi>actions</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Rule) to <hi>think</hi> what he pleaſe. Now ſince a Man cannot be accountable for an <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>himſelf</hi> in particular, unleſs it be firſt granted that he is under a Law as to the Acts of his <hi>underſtanding</hi> in general, before I can proceed any farther I find it neceſſary to lay down this <hi>Preparatory</hi> Poſition, That we are under an Obligation as to the Acts of our underſtanding, or (which is all one) that we are accountable for them. Nay I believe I may venture higher, and affirm that the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not only under Obligation, but that 'tis the <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>immediat</hi> Subject of it. For the proof of which Paradox, I deſire the Patrons of the <hi>Intellectual Libertiniſm</hi> to conſider, that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95868:177"/>
that muſt be the Primary and immediat ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all <hi>Obligation</hi> which is ſo of <hi>Liberty.</hi> Now that this cannot be the <hi>Will,</hi> I ſuppoſe will be acknowledg'd a clear conſequence, if the Will neceſſarily follows the Practical Dictate of the Underſtanding. And that it does ſo, I think there is <hi>Demonſtration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. 'Tis an unqueſtionable Axiom in all the Schools of Learning in the world, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Will is <hi>apparent</hi> good; Now appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good in other words, is that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended or judg'd to be good, and if ſo, then it follows that the Will cannot but conform to the Dictate of the Underſtanding, becauſe otherwiſe ſomthing might be the object of the Will that is not apprehended good, which is contrary to the ſuppoſition. In ſhort, the Will (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> has well expreſſed it) is the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of an <hi>Operative Syllogiſm,</hi> and follows as neceſſarily from the <hi>Dictate</hi> of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as any other Concluſion does from its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and conſequently cannot be the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat</hi> ſubject of Liberty, and conſequently not of Obligation.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But then are we not involv'd in the ſame difficulty as to the <hi>underſtanding?</hi> Does not that act with equal (if not more) neceſſity than the <hi>Will?</hi> So I know it is ordinarily taught. But if this be abſolutely and univerſally true, I muſt confeſs it above the reach of my Capacity to ſalve the Notion of Morality, or Religion, or
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95868:177"/>
to find out an expedient how the <hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> world ſhould not be <hi>out of courſe.</hi> For ſince 'tis evident both from the preceding Demonſtration, and from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Reflection, that the Will neceſſarily acts in Conformity to the Dictates of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, if thoſe very Dictates are alſo wholly and altogether neceſſary, there can be no ſuch thing as a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the man is bound hand and foot, has nothing left whereby to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him a Moral Agent, to qualify him for Law or Obligation, Vertue or Vice, Reward or Puniſhment. But theſe are Abſurdities not to be indured, and therefore I conclude ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of right Reaſoning, the <hi>Principle</hi> from which they flow to be ſo too.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. To clear up then the whole Difficulty with as much Brevity and Perſpicuity as in a matter of this intricacy is poſſible, I ſhall no longer conſider the Underſtanding and Will as Faculties really diſtinct either from the Soul it ſelf, or from one another, but that the Soul does immediatly underſtand and will by it ſelf, without the intervention of any Faculty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And that for this demonſtrative reaſon in ſhort, becauſe in the contrary Hypotheſis, either <hi>Judgment</hi> muſt be aſcribed to the Will, and then the will immediatly commences Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or the Aſſent of the will muſt be blind, brutiſh, and unaccountable, both which are as great Abſurdities as they are true Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:95868:178"/>
This being premiſed, I grant that as the Soul neceſſarily wills as ſhe underſtands, ſo likewiſe does ſhe neceſſarily underſtand as the Object appears. And thus far our ſight <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> in <hi>Fatality,</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> bounds our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</hi> That then that muſt give us a <hi>Proſpect</hi> beyond it, muſt be this, that altho the Soul ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily underſtands or judges according to the Appearance of things, yet that things ſhould ſo <hi>appear</hi> (unleſs it be in Propoſitions that are ſelf-evident, as that the whole is greater than any one part, or the like) is not alike neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but depends upon the degrees of Adverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Attention which the Soul uſes, and which to uſe either more or leſs is fully and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly in her own power. And this indifferency of the Soul as to attending or not attending I take to be the only <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the bottom and foundation into which the Morality of every action muſt be at length reſolv'd. For a farther proof as well as Illuſtration of which Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis let us apply it to a particular caſe and try how well it will anſwer the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> In the caſe then of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> I look upon ſin as an evil, and not only ſo but (while I attend fully to its Nature) the greateſt of evils. And as long as I continue this Judgment 'tis utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible I ſhould commit it, there being according to my preſent apprehenſion no <hi>greater</hi> evil for the declining of which I ſhould think it eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But now the evil of <hi>Pain</hi> being preſented
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95868:178"/>
before me, and I not ſufficiently attending to the evil of Sin, this latter appears to be the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer evil of the two, and I accordingly <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> ſo pronounce it, and in Conformity to that judgment <hi>neceſſarily</hi> chuſe it. But becauſe 'twas abſolutely in my power to have <hi>attended</hi> more heedfully there was Liberty in the Principle, the miſtake which influenc'd the action was vincible, and conſequently the action it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable. This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> however ſtrange it may ſeem to thoſe that have ſworn Faith and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the Dictates of the Schools, I believe will be the more approv'd the more it is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, and that not only as rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent in it ſelf, but alſo as a refuge from thoſe Abſurdities which attend the ordinary Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Neither is this account wholly <hi>unlicens'd</hi> by Authority, for I find ſome hints and intimations of it in the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p n="14">14. From what has been ſaid it appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Morality of every human action muſt be at length reſolv'd into an immediat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference that the Soul has of <hi>attending</hi> or not <hi>attending,</hi> and conſequently that we are not only under Obligation as to the acts of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but that all Obligation <hi>begins</hi> there.</p>

                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:95868:179"/>15. Having thus clear'd the way by the Proof of this Preparatory Poſition, that we are under Obligation as to the acts of the Underſtanding in general, I may now proceed to conſider that our opinion of our ſelves is <hi>one</hi> of thoſe acts of the Underſtanding which are ſubject to Law, or in other terms, that <hi>we are not at our own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to entertain what Opinions we pleaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſelves, but that we ought to regulate them by ſome Standard.</hi> Now the general rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is, becauſe 'tis of great moment and influence in relation to our Practice, what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we entertain concerning our ſelves. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are many acts of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which tho originally <hi>free,</hi> yet fall under no Obligation by reaſon of the <hi>Indifferency</hi> of the Matter, as in things of pure and naked Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Theſe are the <hi>unforbidden</hi> Trees of the Garden, and here we may let looſe the Reins and indulge our thoughts the full Scope.

There are <hi>other</hi> things which have a <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Aſpect, and here 'tis not <hi>indifferent</hi> what we <hi>think,</hi> becauſe 'tis not <hi>indifferent</hi> what we <hi>do.</hi> Now among theſe the Opinion of our ſelves is to be reckon'd, as having a great influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

For how can he ſubmit to the Wiſdom of his Superiours, and pay an <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi> deference to the <hi>Occult</hi> reaſons of State, who thinks himſelf wiſer than a whole <hi>Senate,</hi> and diſputes even the ways of <hi>Providence?</hi> Pride was ever obſerved to be the Mother of Faction and Rebellion, and accordingly St. <hi>Jude</hi> makes it part of the <hi>Character</hi> of the Proud <hi>Gnoſtics, To deſpiſe Dominions and ſpeak evil of Dignities.</hi>

                     <p n="32">32. Then Thirdly, In relation to our Selves, here is this grand ill conſequence of an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſelf-eſteem, that it unqualifies us not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for higher attainments, but even for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>endeavours</hi> of improvement, and ſo cuts ſhort and <hi>bedmarfs</hi> all our excellencies.

                     </p>
                     <p n="33">33. And as the immoderate eſteem of our Selves unqualifies us for the performance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Duties, ſo does it alſo in the ſecond place Betray us into many Sins.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Firſt, Into all thoſe ſins which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the foremention'd Vertues reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And beſides them into many more, ſuch as are preſumption and ſecurity, vexation and diſcontent, contempt of others (tho at the ſame time it expoſes us to theirs) Anger and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Malice and Revenge. For the Proud man is not content to be his own <hi>private</hi> Admirer,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:95868:185"/>
but quarrels with all others that are not of his perſwaſion, and with the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> kindles a <hi>fire</hi> for thoſe who will not <hi>fall down and worſhip the Image which he has ſet up.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="35">35. Neither does the <hi>Leproſy</hi> ſtop here. But as it betrays us into many ſins, ſo in the Third and laſt place (which is the moſt diſmal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of all) It fruſtrates all Methods of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Gods judgments will but exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and inrage him, becauſe he thinks he does <hi>not</hi> deſerve them, and his Mercies will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear him, becauſe he thinks he <hi>does.

                        <p n="1">1. TO make this our Diſcourſe about Sin more clear and diſtinct, before we enter upon its Nature 'twill be requiſite to premiſe ſomthing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the double acceptation of the word. For nothing can be <hi>defined</hi> before it be <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. I obſerve therefore, that Sin may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd either <hi>abſtractedly,</hi> for the bare act of Obliquity, or <hi>concretely</hi> with ſuch a <hi>ſpecial</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of it upon the will as renders the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>guilty,</hi> or obnoxious to puniſhment. I ſay with ſuch a <hi>ſpecial</hi> dependence of it upon the will; for not every dependence of an action upon the will is ſufficient to make it <hi>imputable,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewn hereafter. The former of theſe, by thoſe that diſtinguiſh more nicely, is call'd <hi>tranſgreſſio voluntatis,</hi> the latter <hi>tranſgreſſio vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaria,</hi> or according to the more ordinary diſtinction the former is the <hi>material,</hi> the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>formal</hi> part of Sin.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="362" facs="tcp:95868:188"/>3. This diſtinction is both <hi>real</hi> and <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> 1. it is <hi>real,</hi> becauſe the Idea or conception of <hi>material</hi> ſin is not only diſtinct from the Idea of <hi>formal</hi> ſin (as it may be in things really the ſame) but when conſider'd as <hi>alone</hi> does poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively exclude the other. For this notion, <hi>a bare act of Obliquity,</hi> does not only <hi>preſcind from,</hi> but alſo <hi>poſitively deny</hi> ſuch a ſpecial depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it upon the will as makes it imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for puniſhment.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Now as it is a certain ſign of <hi>Identity</hi> when the Idea of one thing neceſſarily includes the Idea of another, ſo is it of <hi>real diſtinction</hi> when the Idea of one thing in any caſe poſitively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Idea of the other. There may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be diſtinct conceptions of one and the ſame thing, whereof there are different Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertys or Degrees, but then one does only <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from,</hi> and not in any caſe <hi>poſitively exclude</hi> the other. Which when it does it is an evident ſign of <hi>real diſtinction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. But the greateſt Argument of real diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is <hi>ſeparability</hi> and <hi>actual ſeparation.</hi> For nothing can be ſeparated from it ſelf. And this alſo has place here. For the <hi>material</hi> part of ſin may actually exiſt without the <hi>formal.</hi> That is, there may be an act of obliquity, or an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular act without any guilt deriv'd upon the Agent, or to ſpeak more ſtrictly, without that <hi>ſpecial</hi> dependence of the act upon the will which is the <hi>foundation</hi> of that guilt. This is
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:95868:188"/>
evident in the caſe of <hi>fools</hi> and <hi>mad men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. And as this Diſtinction is <hi>real,</hi> ſo alſo is it very <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>neceſſary.</hi> 1ſt in the <hi>notion,</hi> to prevent ambiguitys and fallacys, that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the uſe of the word (ſin).

                           <hi>Devil,</hi> certainly 'twould be a fallacy to argue hence that every mere act of obliquity is <hi>Diabolical,</hi> becauſe a ſin, ſince not <hi>material</hi> but <hi>formal</hi> ſin was the thing intended in Saint <hi>John</hi>'s Propoſition.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. 2ly in the <hi>thing,</hi> for the honour and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Divine Attributes. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the damning of Infants merely for the corruption of nature, commonly call'd Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin; It being repugnant to the meaſures of Juſtice and the Dictates of Common Senſe, that the bare doing an irregular act, or the bare hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an irregular propenſion ſhould be <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at all,</hi> much more with <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> as it muſt be if <hi>every</hi> dependence of an action upon the will be enough to render it imputable, that is, if every <hi>material</hi> be alſo a <hi>formal</hi> ſin.

                        <p n="8">8.

                           <hi>SECT. II.</hi> A more particular and explicit conſideration of Material ſin, and what it adds to the general nature of evil.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. AFter our Diſtinction of ſin into <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Formal,</hi> and our juſtification of that diſtinction, it follows that in the next place we give ſome more particular and explicit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nature of <hi>Material</hi> ſin. That it is an <hi>irregular act</hi> in general, was intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but to ſpeculate its nature more thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt ſet it in a clearer light, and define what it is that makes an action irregular. And the account which I ſhall give of this, I ſhall ground upon that Definition of St. <hi>John,</hi> who tells us that <hi>ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> So that tranſgreſſion of the Law is the <hi>irregularity</hi> of an action, and is more explicitly the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> part of ſin.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thus far in <hi>general.</hi> But now to make Tranſgreſſion of the Law fully adequate and commenſurate to <hi>Material</hi> ſin, ſo as to extend to all kinds of it, it concerns us in the next place to enquire, what is here to be underſtood by (<hi>Law</hi>) and upon the right ſtating of this, will depend the whole <hi>Theory</hi> of <hi>Material ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="367" facs="tcp:95868:189"/>3. By Law therefore in the firſt place, is to be underſtood that which is <hi>Poſitive,</hi> that is, any rule of action preſcribed to us by God, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd only <hi>as preſcribed.</hi> Any action ſo preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, be it otherwiſe never ſo indifferent for the <hi>matter,</hi> puts on the force of a <hi>Law</hi> from the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the Preſcriber, and every tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a Rule is <hi>Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. But the Tranſgreſſion of Law in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſenſe of the word will not comprehend all the kinds of <hi>Material</hi> ſin. For altho Poſitive Law creates the <hi>firſt</hi> difference in <hi>ſome</hi> things, yet it does not in <hi>all.</hi> For had God never made any <hi>Poſitive</hi> Law yet the doing of <hi>ſome</hi> actions would have been <hi>ſin,</hi> nay there was ſin where there was no Poſitive Law, as may be probably collected from the fall of <hi>Angels.</hi> But where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion. There muſt be therefore ſome other law beſides <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Law.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. By Law therefore 2ly is to be underſtood the Law of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that Candle of the Lord that lights every man that comes into the world in his paſſage through it. This is twofold. For 1ſt, by the Law of Reaſon may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that Original ſtock of <hi>rational Tendencys</hi> or practical ſentiments which prevent all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and reaſonings about what is to be done, and anſwer to <hi>Speculative Principles.</hi> For as the Animal and ſenſitive Nature is not only fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Senſe and Perception, but alſo with
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:95868:190"/>
certain connatural inſtincts and impreſſions, whereby Animals are directed and inclined to <hi>ſenſitive good,</hi> ſo for the guardianſhip and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Vertue, againſt the danger either of <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>inadvertence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> God has furniſh'd the Rational nature not only with the faculty of reaſoning, but with certain common Principles and Notions, whereby 'tis inclined to the good of the <hi>Reaſonable</hi> life. This is the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſo much talkt of, and that which men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally mean by the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Or elſe 2ly, by the Law of Reaſon may be underſtood a Power, which a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has of finding out by diſcourſing from firſt Principles what is fit to be done, and of reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the reaſonableneſs of thoſe Moral <hi>Anticipations</hi> and impreſſions, which he <hi>before</hi> entertain'd, tho he knew not upon what <hi>ground.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. Theſe two make up the adequate notion of the Law of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but we are not yet come to the adequate notion of <hi>Law.</hi> For if the Law of Reaſon be taken in the firſt ſenſe for a ſtock of Moral Anticipations implanted by God in the Soul, this will be but another branch of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> Law. For <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> are but different modes of Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and neither of theſe can be the <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> Reaſon, into which the Morality of every action is to be reſolv'd.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. But if the Law of Reaſon be taken in the latter ſenſe, for a Power which a Rational
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:95868:190"/>
Creature has of finding out by diſcourſe what is reaſonable to be done, this will of neceſſity lead us <hi>higher,</hi> namely to conſider that there are certain antecedent and independent <hi>apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> or qualitys in things, with reſpect to which they are fit to be commanded or forbidden by the wiſe governour of the world in ſome <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Law, whether that of internal or external Revelation, or both.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. We are therefore in the next place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve theſe antecedent aptneſſes of things into their proper <hi>ground,</hi> or to aſſign what that is which makes an action <hi>fit</hi> to be <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>forbidden.</hi> Which when we have done we are advanced as high as we can go, and have found out that ſupreme, eternal and irreverſible Law, which preſcribes meaſures to all the reſt, and is the <hi>laſt</hi> Reaſon of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. That therefore which makes an action fit to be commanded or forbidden by the wiſe governour of the world, can be nothing elſe in <hi>general,</hi> but its reſpective tendency to prompt or hinder the attainment of ſome certain <hi>end</hi> or other, which that <hi>governour</hi> propoſes. For all action being <hi>for</hi> ſome end, and not <hi>the</hi> End it <hi>ſelf,</hi> its aptneſs to be commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den muſt be founded upon its ſerviceableneſs or diſſerviceableneſs to ſome end. So much in general.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. I further conſider, that this end muſt be that which is ſimply and abſolutely the <hi>beſt</hi> and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:95868:191"/>
                           <hi>greateſt.</hi> For no other is worthy of <hi>God.</hi> Now certainly there is none better or greater than the <hi>univerſal good</hi> of the whole Siſteme of things, which is therefore to be regarded and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted to the utmoſt both by <hi>God</hi> and all other <hi>Intelligent</hi> Beings.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. And hence ariſes this firſt and great <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> that whatever naturally tends to the promotion of the common intereſt is <hi>good</hi> and apt to be <hi>commanded,</hi> and whatever natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tends to the diſintereſt of the public, is <hi>evil</hi> and apt to be <hi>forbidden.</hi> This is the great <hi>Baſis</hi> of Morality, the fixt and immutable ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of good and evil, and the <hi>fundamental</hi> Law of Nature.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. And becauſe there are ſome actions <hi>in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> which with relation to the preſent ſyſteme both of the Material and Intellectual world, have ſuch a <hi>natural</hi> connexion with the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or prejudice of this great end, therefore theſe by way of <hi>Aſſumption</hi> under the two <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Propoſitions are intrinſecally and naturally <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> and are thereby differenc'd from thoſe that are made ſo only by <hi>arbitrary Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi> Tho yet in one reſpect <hi>theſe</hi> are arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry too, in as much as they depend upon ſuch a particular Hypotheſis of the world which was <hi>it ſelf</hi> arbitrary, and which if God ſhould at any time change, the relations of actions to the great end might change too; that which now <hi>naturally</hi> makes <hi>for</hi> the common advantage,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:95868:191"/>
might <hi>as naturally</hi> make <hi>againſt</hi> it, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that which is <hi>now</hi> good might have been <hi>then</hi> evil. But ſtill the two <hi>great Hinges</hi> of Morality ſtand as fixt and as unvariable as the two <hi>Poles;</hi> whatever is naturally conducive to the common intereſt is <hi>good,</hi> and whatever has a contrary influence is <hi>evil. Theſe</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of eternal and unchangeable verity, and which God can no more cancel or diſanull than he can <hi>deny himſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">14.

If it be now objected that according to theſe meaſures there will be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Phyſical</hi> evil, contrary to the common diſtinction between <hi>malum Turpe</hi> and <hi>malum Noxium,</hi> the one as oppoſed to <hi>bonum utile,</hi> and the other as oppoſed to <hi>bonum hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum;</hi> I anſwer, that I know of no good or evil but of the <hi>end</hi> and of the <hi>means.</hi> Good of the end is what we call <hi>bonum jucundum,</hi> good of the means is what we call <hi>utile.</hi> Evil of the end there is properly none, but that only is evil which is prejudicial to it. Indeed the old ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Morality diſcours'd of moral good and evil as of <hi>abſolute natures,</hi> and accordingly, nothing ſo common among them as to talk of <hi>Eſſential Rectitudes,</hi> and <hi>Eſſential Turpitudes.</hi> But I think it greater accuracy to ſay, that Moral good and evil are <hi>Relative</hi> things, that <hi>bonum honeſtum</hi> is one and the ſame with that which is truly <hi>utile,</hi> and that <hi>Malum Turpe</hi> is that which is naturally againſt the profit of the <hi>Community.</hi> And herein I aſſert no more than what the great maſter of the Latin <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> profeſſedly contends for through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                           <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The ſecond part of the Diſcourſe, which briefly treats of Formal ſin, with the requiſites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neceſſary to its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Where alſo 'tis enquired, whether the Nature of ſin be poſitive or privative.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. WE are now come to the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of our Diſcourſe, where we are to treat of the nature of <hi>Formal</hi> Sin, that is, of Sin conſider'd not <hi>abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly</hi> for the mere act of Obliquity, but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely</hi> with ſuch a <hi>ſpecial</hi> dependence of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will as ſerves to render the Agent guilty, or obnoxious to puniſhment.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And here the firſt thing to be obſerv'd is, that altho <hi>material</hi> ſin does neither in its <hi>notion</hi> nor in its <hi>exiſtence</hi> include <hi>formal</hi> ſin, yet <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> ſin does always include the other. Tho there may be a tranſgreſſion of the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>formal</hi> ſin, yet the latter always ſuppoſes the former, and as St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi>
                           <note place="margin">John 3. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>committeth ſin, tranſgreſſes alſo the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. But that which <hi>formal</hi> ſin adds over and above to <hi>material,</hi> and under whoſe reſpect we are now to conſider it, is the <hi>connotation</hi> of that <hi>ſpecial</hi> dependence of it upon the will which
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95868:193"/>
derives guilt upon the Agent. So that for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of formal ſin we may ſay, that it is an irregular action, or a tranſgreſſion of the law, ſo depending upon the will, as to make the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent liable to puniſhment. This is in the Phraſe of St. <hi>John</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="4">4. From this <hi>general</hi> notion of <hi>formal</hi> ſin, proceed we to enquire what that <hi>ſpecial depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is that makes an irregular action formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſin. And here 'tis in the firſt place ſuppoſed, that not <hi>every</hi> dependence of an action upon the will is ſufficient to make it imputable. And with very good reaſon. For otherwiſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Infants, Fools</hi> and <hi>Madmen</hi> would be <hi>imputable,</hi> for theſe (as indeed all actions) have <hi>ſome</hi> dependence upon the will, at leaſt as a <hi>Phyſical Principle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. To be <hi>poſitive</hi> therefore, that an irregular action may <hi>ſo</hi> depend upon the will as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive guilt upon the Agent, 'tis neceſſary firſt, that it proceed from the will as from a <hi>free</hi> Principle; Free not only in oppoſition to <hi>coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> (for ſo <hi>all</hi> the actions of the will are free) but in oppoſition to <hi>neceſſity</hi> or determination to one part of the contradiction. That is in one word, 'tis neceſſary to the imputableneſs
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:95868:194"/>
of an action that it be <hi>avoidable.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that common ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin, Nemo peccat</hi> (that is <hi>formaliter) in eo quod vitare non poteſt.</hi> And great reaſon the Father had to ſay ſo, for he that cannot avoid tranſgreſſing the Law is not ſo much as capable of being <hi>obliged</hi> by it (becauſe no man can be obliged to what is impoſſible) and if he be not obliged by it, certainly he cannot Morally and Formally break it. A thing which the Patrons of <hi>Phyſical Predetermination</hi> would do well to conſider.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But when I make it neceſſary to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putableneſs of an action that it be freely exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I would not be underſtood of an <hi>immediat</hi> Freeneſs. For certainly thoſe rooted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd ſinners, who have by long uſe reduced themſelves under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſinning, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the more <hi>excuſable</hi> for the <hi>impotence</hi> they have contracted. If there was <hi>Liberty</hi> in the <hi>Principle</hi> 'tis ſufficient.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The next requiſite, and that which gives the laſt and finiſhing ſtroke to Formal ſin is, that it proceeds from the will <hi>ſufficiently inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the <hi>underſtanding.</hi> That is, to make a man ſin formally 'tis requiſite that he has not only a Power of avoiding that action, which is a tranſgreſſion of the Law, but that he alſo <hi>know</hi> it to be a Tranſgreſſion of the Law, at leaſt that he be in a <hi>capacity</hi> ſo to do, that ſo he may be induced to <hi>exert</hi> that <hi>Power.</hi> And 'tis alſo neceſſary that he know that he <hi>commits</hi> it, that
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:95868:194"/>
is, he muſt have or at leaſt be in a <hi>capacity</hi> of having, both <hi>notitia Juris</hi> and <hi>notitia Facti.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. The former of theſe depends upon that common Principle that Laws do not oblige till they are <hi>publiſh'd,</hi> according to that known Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of the <hi>Canon Law, Leges conſtituuntur cum promulgantur,</hi> and that of the <hi>Civilians, Leges quae conſtringunt hominum vitas intelligi ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus debent.</hi> And the latter alſo depends upon the <hi>equity</hi> of the ſame Principle, tho ſomewhat more remotely, for without this the Law, with relation to that <hi>particular</hi> inſtance, cannot be ſaid to be properly known. For altho I know ſuch a ſpecies of action (ſuppoſe Adultery) to be a tranſgreſſion of the Law, yet if I know not that by ſuch a particular inſtance I <hi>commit</hi> it, I cannot be ſaid to know that <hi>this my action</hi> is a <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> and conſequently (ſuppoſing this my ignorance <hi>invincible</hi>) am wholly excuſable; as appears in the caſe<note place="margin">Gen. 20.</note> of <hi>Abimelech</hi> when he took <hi>Abraham</hi>'s wife.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. So that to the Conſtitution of Formal ſin theſe two things are required, 1ſt, that the Tranſgreſſor have a Power either <hi>immediatly,</hi> or at leaſt in the <hi>Principle</hi> of not doing that action which is a <hi>Tranſgreſſion:</hi> 2ly, that he either <hi>do</hi> or <hi>may</hi> know that act to be a <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the Law, and likewiſe, that he know when he <hi>commits</hi> it. And thus have I ſhewn the riſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and maturity of ſin; I have preſented to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:95868:195"/>
view both the <hi>imperfect Embryo</hi> and the <hi>full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd</hi> and animated <hi>Monſter.</hi> All which I ſhall briefly comprize in that compendious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of St. <hi>James, Luſt when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi>
                           <note place="margin">James 1. 15.</note> 
                           <hi>bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſh'd, bringeth forth death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. There is one thing behind relating to the nature of ſin in <hi>common,</hi> which I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, and that is, whether its nature be <hi>Poſitive</hi> or <hi>Privative.</hi> The latter is generally held both by Metaphyſitians, Moraliſts and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, but upon what ſufficient grounds I could never yet underſtand. The <hi>Formal</hi> part of ſin without all Queſtion is <hi>Poſitive,</hi> as is plain from the very notion of it. For it denotes only that <hi>ſpecial</hi> Dependence which an irregular act has upon the will, which is the ſame (as well as the common ſubſtance of the act) both in <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> actions, and conſequently <hi>alike Poſitive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. All the controverſy therefore remains concerning the <hi>Material</hi> part of ſin, whether that be Poſitive or Privative. And this too, not with reſpect to the <hi>mere Act</hi> (for that without queſtion is <hi>poſitive</hi>) but with reſpect to the <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Here then I conſider, that according to the foregoing meaſures the irregularity of an action is not only its aberration <hi>from</hi> the Rule, but its <hi>croſſing</hi> or going <hi>contrary</hi> to it. For 'tis not only its <hi>not promoting,</hi> but its <hi>oppoſing,</hi> or at leaſt its natural aptneſs to oppoſe the greateſt
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:95868:195"/>
and beſt of ends. So that 'tis not ſo properly an <hi>irregularity,</hi> as a <hi>contra-regularity.</hi> And therefore good and bad actions are not <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> but <hi>contrarily</hi> oppoſed, and conſequently both poſitive, for <hi>contrarys</hi> are always ſo.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. For as <hi>to be in pain</hi> is not <hi>Privatively</hi> but <hi>contrarily</hi> oppoſed to being <hi>Happy</hi> (for <hi>Pain</hi> is ſomething more than <hi>want of Happineſs</hi>) ſo that <hi>action</hi> which cauſes <hi>Pain</hi> or miſery is not <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively</hi> but <hi>contrarily</hi> oppoſed to that which is effective of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and conſequently is as Poſitive as the other.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Thoſe ſins which bid the faireſt for <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> are ſins of <hi>Omiſſion.</hi> But even theſe, if we conſider their Nature, will appear to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Poſitive. For to ſpeak properly, their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity does not lye in the <hi>not doing</hi> or the <hi>not willing</hi> to do what ought to be done, but in the <hi>willing not</hi> to do it. But <hi>to will</hi> the <hi>not doing</hi> of a thing is as <hi>poſitive</hi> as the willing <hi>to do</hi> it, as being not <hi>contradictorily</hi> or <hi>privatively,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily</hi> oppoſed to it. The ſins therefore of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi> are as Poſitive as thoſe of <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> The only difference is, that the Poſitiveneſs of ſins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> lies both in the <hi>Habitude</hi> of the <hi>will,</hi> and in the <hi>executed act</hi> too, whereas the Poſitiveneſs of ſins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> is in the <hi>Habitude</hi> of the <hi>will only.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">15. And what is here determin'd concerning <hi>Moral evil,</hi> will, I ſuppoſe, hold equally true in <hi>all</hi> evil, except only that which is <hi>Abſolute,</hi> that
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:95868:196"/>
is, whoſe evil is not its <hi>noxiouſneſs</hi> to any thing <hi>elſe,</hi> but only the <hi>want</hi> of ſome conſtituent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection due to <hi>its ſelf,</hi> according to that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction mention'd by <hi>Suarez</hi> in his Diſputation <hi>de Malo,</hi> of <hi>Malum in ſe</hi> and <hi>malum alteri. This</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does import no more than a <hi>Privation.</hi> And this I ſuppoſe might be the occaſion of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to thoſe who firſt thought <hi>Moral evil</hi> to conſiſt in a <hi>Privation</hi> only; for <hi>Abſolute</hi> evil does ſo, and they (as I intimated above) took <hi>Moral</hi> evil to be a kind of <hi>abſolute Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">16. Many things I know might be and are commonly objected againſt the <hi>Poſitiveneſs</hi> of ſin, but I can think but of one that's worth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, which is, that if Sin be <hi>poſitive</hi> it will be a <hi>real Entity,</hi> and if ſo, then we are preſs'd with a double abſurdity, 1ſt that God will be the Author of it, as being the efficient cauſe of all <hi>Entity.</hi> 2ly, that it will be <hi>good,</hi> goodneſs being a neceſſary Affection of <hi>Ens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="17">17. To this I anſwer, 1ſt that I not only freely <hi>acknowledg,</hi> but <hi>contend</hi> that ſin is a <hi>real Entity.</hi> But then I diſtinguſh of <hi>Entity.</hi> There are <hi>Phyſical,</hi> and there are <hi>Moral</hi> Entitys. By the latter (which alone needs explication) I underſtand certain modes of determination, ſuperadded to Phyſical things or motions by intelligent Beings, in order either to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or diſintereſt of the univerſe.</p>
                        <p>18. This being premiſed, I anſwer to the firſt part of the objection by <hi>denying</hi> that it
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:95868:196"/>
hence follows that God is the Author of ſin. God indeed is the Author of all <hi>Phyſical Beings</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> but not of thoſe <hi>modes of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> ſuperadded by <hi>Intelligent</hi> Beings, which I call <hi>Moral Entitys.</hi> As to the ſecond, I grant the <hi>conſequence,</hi> but deny the <hi>abſurdity</hi> of it. For it is no abſurdity that <hi>Moral evil</hi> ſhould be <hi>Metaphyſically good.</hi> For this Metaphyſical, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendental goodneſs, which is the affection of <hi>Ens,</hi> is nothing elſe but a Being's having that eſſence whereof it is capable, or (as <hi>Suarez</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it) its having that perfection which is <hi>convenient</hi> to it. But this is very conſiſtent with the nature of <hi>Moral evil,</hi> for this may have what belongs to its <hi>Idea</hi> as well as <hi>good,</hi> and 'tis the <hi>Perfection</hi> of ſin to be <hi>exceeding ſinful.</hi>

Moreover, the greatneſs of this evil above all others is <hi>à poſteriori</hi> further confirm'd from the greatneſs of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> required for its <hi>attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> God <hi>could not,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>thought not fit</hi> to remit it without the ſhedding of blood, and that too of the <hi>blood of God.</hi> So great a <hi>Fool</hi> is he, ſo little does he conſider, that <hi>makes a mock at ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Again it may be hence collected, that no <hi>Formal</hi> ſin can be in its <hi>own nature venial.</hi> For according to the former meaſures every For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſin tho never ſo ſmall, is a ſin againſt the <hi>greateſt Charity imaginable.</hi> For 'tis againſt <hi>that Charity</hi> whereby I ought to promote the ends of God, and proſecute the great intereſt of the univerſe. And conſequently, cannot be in its own Nature venial, or pardonable without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Nay may I not further conclude accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preceding meaſures, that 'tis very <hi>probable</hi> that no ſin could have been pardon'd even <hi>with</hi> Repentance, had there not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made for it, and that <hi>vindicative Juſtice</hi> is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the nature of God? For
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:95868:198"/>
when I conſider ſin, I find it ſo diametrically contrary to the eſſential ſanctity of God, and ſo deſtructive of that great End which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but propoſe, that he muſt needs hate it with an <hi>infinite</hi> hatred. But how he ſhould do ſo, and yet not <hi>puniſh</hi> for it, is hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Upon theſe meaſures we may alſo find out a way of reconciling <hi>eternal puniſhments</hi> with <hi>Divine Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>great Objection</hi> is, what <hi>Proportion</hi> is there between a <hi>tranſient</hi> act of ſin and <hi>eternal</hi> miſery? And if there be none, how is it conſiſtent with divine Juſtice to inflict the one for the other? This has been a great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and has for a long time ſtood proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſolutions. But now if we conſider ſin as <hi>contrarily</hi> oppoſed to the <hi>greateſt poſſible good,</hi> the good of the <hi>univerſe,</hi> and conſequently as the <hi>greateſt poſſible evil,</hi> its demerit will be ſuch that we need not fear 'twill be <hi>over-puniſh'd</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with <hi>eternal</hi> miſery. For if any miſery is to be endured rather than one ſin to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, 'tis alſo juſt that any <hi>may</hi> be, when it <hi>is</hi> committed. For the equity of <hi>both</hi> depends upon ſin's being the <hi>greateſt evil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. The laſt Deduction which I ſhall make from the Premiſes is this, that he who <hi>thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtands</hi> and <hi>actually attends</hi> to the nature of ſin, cannot poſſibly commit it. For as long as he does ſo, he muſt look upon it as the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil,</hi> otherwiſe he cannot be ſaid rightly to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:95868:199"/>
underſtand it. And if he look upon it as the greateſt evil he cannot chuſe it, ſo long as he continues in that judgment, becauſe the then chuſing it would be the chuſing of <hi>all that</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it <hi>exceeds</hi> other evils, <hi>gratis,</hi> which is the chuſing of evil <hi>as evil,</hi> which is <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Whoſoever therefore conſents to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin paſſes firſt a <hi>wrong judgment</hi> upon it, has the <hi>light of his underſtanding darkned,</hi> and intercepted by a cloud of Paſſion, loſes the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conviction</hi> of ſin's being the <hi>greateſt evil,</hi> and ſo commits it to avoid (as he then fooliſhly thinks) a <hi>greater.</hi> So that the cauſe and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of all ſin is <hi>ignorance, folly</hi> and <hi>inadvertence:</hi> there is a falſe Propoſition in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> before there is any miſapplication in the <hi>will,</hi> and 'tis through the <hi>ſwimming of the head</hi> that the <hi>feet ſlip</hi> and loſe their ſtation.

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p n="1">1. THO you have been pleas'd to aſſign me the Task of an Angel, and in that Reſpect have warranted me to diſobey you; yet, ſince a conſiderable part of that experimental Knowledg which I have of Happineſs is owing to the Delight, which I take in your vertuous and endearing Friendſhip, I think 'tis but reaſonable I ſhould endeavour to give you an <hi>Idea</hi> of that, whereof you have given me the <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. You deſire to know of me wherein the greateſt Happineſs attainable by man in this Life does conſiſt. And here, tho I ſee my ſelf engaged in a work already too difficult for me, yet I find it neceſſary to enlarge it: For, ſince the greateſt Happineſs, or <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> of this Life is a <hi>Species</hi> of Happineſs in general, and ſince it is call'd (Greateſt) not becauſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect and compleat; but inaſmuch as it comes neareſt to that which indeed is ſo, it will be neceſſary firſt to ſtate the Notion of Happineſs in General, and then to define where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Happineſs does conſiſt which is perfect and compleat, before I can proceed to a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of your Queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="394" facs="tcp:95868:203"/>3. By Happineſs, in the moſt general Senſe of the word, I underſtand nothing elſe but an Enjoyment of any Good. The leaſt Degree of Good has the ſame Proportion to the leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Happineſs as the greateſt has to the greateſt, and conſequently as many ways as a man enjoys any Good, ſo many ways he may be ſaid to be happy: neither will the Mixture of Evil make him forfeit his Right to this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, unleſs it either <hi>equals</hi> the Good he enjoys, or <hi>exceeds</hi> it: And then indeed it does; but the Reaſon is, becauſe in ſtrictneſs of Speaking, upon the whole Account the man enjoys no Good at all: For if the Good and the Evil be equal-balanc'd, it muſt needs be indifferent to that man either to be or not to be, there being not the leaſt <hi>Grain</hi> of good to determine his Choice: So that he can no more be ſaid to be happy in that Condition, than he could before he was born. And much leſs, if the Evil exceeds the Good: For then he is not only not happy, but abſolutely and purely miſerable: For after an exact Commenſuration ſuppoſed between the Good and the Evil, all that remains over of the Evil is pure and ſimple Miſery; which is the Caſe of the Damn'd: And when 'tis once come to this (whatever ſome Mens <hi>Metaphyſics</hi> may perſwade them) I am very well ſatisfied, that 'tis better not to be than to be. But now on the other ſide, if the Good does never ſo little out-weigh the Evil, that <hi>Overplus</hi> of Good
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:95868:203"/>
is as pure and unallay'd in its Proportion, as if there were no ſuch Mixture at all; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Poſſeſſion of it may properly be call'd Happineſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I know the Maſters of Moral Philoſophy do not treat of Happineſs in this Latitude; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it fit they ſhould: For their Buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to point out the ultimate End of Human Actions, it would be an impertinent thing for them to give any other <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> than the higheſt: But however this does not hinder but that the General <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> may be extended farther, even to the Fruition of any Good whatſoever: Neither is there any reaſon to find Fault with the Latitude of this Notion, ſince we acknowledg Degrees even in Glory.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In this General <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Happineſs</hi> two things are contain'd. One is, ſome Good, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real or apparent, in the Fruition of which we are ſaid to be in ſome meaſure or other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. The other is the very Fruition it ſelf. The firſt of theſe is uſually called <hi>Objective Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and the latter <hi>Formal.</hi> Some I know di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Happineſs into theſe as diſtinct <hi>Species;</hi> but I think not ſo artificially: For they are both but conſtituent Parts, which joyntly make up one and the ſame Happineſs: Neither of them are ſufficient alone, but they are both equally neceſſary. That the laſt of theſe is a neceſſary Ingredient, I think no doubt can reaſonably be made: For what would the greateſt Good
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95868:204"/>
imaginable ſignifie without Fruition? And that the former is likewiſe neceſſary is no leſs certain: For how can there be ſuch a thing as Fruition without an Object? I grant 'tis not at all neceſſary that the Object be a real ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Good; if it appear ſo, 'tis ſufficient.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From this Diſtinction of <hi>real</hi> and <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> Good, ſome have taken occaſion to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Happineſs likewiſe into two ſorts, <hi>real</hi> and <hi>imaginary:</hi> But I believe, upon a more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Scrutiny into the matter, 'twill be found, that all Happineſs, according to its Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is equally <hi>real;</hi> and that that which they term <hi>Imaginary,</hi> too well deſerves the Name, there being no ſuch thing in Nature: For let the Object of it be never ſo <hi>Phantaſtic,</hi> yet it muſt ſtill carry the Semblance and Appearance of Good (otherwiſe it can neither <hi>move</hi> the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite nor <hi>pleaſe</hi> it, and conſequently be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Object of <hi>Deſire</hi> nor of <hi>Fruition;</hi>) and if ſo, the Happineſs muſt needs be real, becauſe the Formality of the Object, tho 'twere never ſo true and real a good, would notwithſtanding lie in the <hi>Appearance,</hi> not in the <hi>Reality:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be real or no is purely accidental: For, ſince to be happy can be nothing elſe but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſomthing which I deſire, the Object of my Happineſs muſt needs be <hi>enjoy'd</hi> under the ſame Formality as 'tis <hi>deſired.</hi> Now ſince 'tis deſired only as apparently good, it muſt needs pleaſe me when obtained under the ſame Notion. So
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:95868:204"/>
that it matters not to the Reality of my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whether the Object of it be really good, or only apprehended ſo, ſince if it were never ſo <hi>real,</hi> it <hi>pleaſes</hi> only as <hi>apparent.</hi> The Fool has his Paradiſe as well as the Wiſe-man, and for the time is as happy in it; and a kind Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will make a Cloud as pleaſing as the Queen of <hi>Heaven.</hi> And therefore I think it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man to think himſelf happy, and (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Perſwaſion) not really to be ſo. He enjoys the <hi>Creature</hi> of his own Fancy, worſhips the <hi>Idol</hi> of his Imagination, and the happieſt man upon Earth does no more: For let the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his Life be what they will, 'tis his Opinion only that muſt give the Reliſh. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, Heaven it ſelf would afford him no Content, nor the Viſion of God prove <hi>Beatific.</hi> 'Tis true, the man is ſeated at the <hi>Spring-Head</hi> of Happineſs, is ſurrounded with excellent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but alas, it appears not ſo to him; he is not at all affected with his Condition, but, like <hi>Adam,</hi> lies faſt in a dead Sleep in the midſt of Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The Sum of this Argument is this; Good is in the ſame manner the Object of <hi>Fruition,</hi> as 'tis of Deſire; and that is not as <hi>really</hi> good in its own Nature, but as 'tis <hi>judged</hi> ſo by the Underſtanding: And conſequently, tho it be only apparent, it muſt needs be as effectual to <hi>gratifie</hi> the Appetite as it was at firſt to <hi>excite</hi> it during that Appearance. So long as it keeps
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95868:205"/>
on its Vizor and impoſes upon the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what is wanting in the thing, is made up by an <hi>obliging</hi> Impoſture, and <hi>Ignorance</hi> becomes here the Mother of <hi>Happineſs</hi> as well as of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion:</hi> But if the man will <hi>dare</hi> to be wiſe, and too curiouſly examine the ſuperficial Tinſel-Good, he undeceives himſelf to his own Coſt, and, like <hi>Adam,</hi> adventuring to eat of the Tree of <hi>Knowledg,</hi> ſees himſelf naked, and is aſhamed. And for this reaſon I think it impoſſible for any man to love to be flatter'd: 'Tis true, he may delight to hear himſelf commended by thoſe who indeed do flatter him; but the true reaſon of that is, becauſe he does not apprehend that to be Flattery which indeed is ſo; but when he once throughly knows it, 'tis impoſſible he ſhould be any longer delighted with it. I ſhall conclude this Point with this uſeful Reflection, That ſince every Man's Happineſs depends wholly upon his own opinion, the foundatiou upon which all envious men proceed, muſt needs be either <hi>falſe</hi> or very <hi>uncertain.</hi> Falſe, if they think that outward Circumſtances and States of life are all the Ingredients of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but uncertain however: For ſince they meaſure the Happineſs of other Men by their own Opinion, 'tis mere Chance if they do not miſplace their Envy, unleſs they were ſure the other Perſon was of the like opinion with themſelves. And now what a vain irrational thing is it to diſquiet our ſelves into a diſlike
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95868:205"/>
of our own Condition, merely becauſe we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake another Man's?</p>

                        </gap>ing Soul. And I happened to fall into it upon a ſerious reflection on the nature of Fruition in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Periods and Circumſtances of my Life. For I obſerv'd according to my <hi>Narrow</hi> experience, that I never had in all my Life the ſame thoughts of any good in the very time of the enjoying it as I had before. I have known when I have promiſed my ſelf vaſt Satisfactions, and my imagination has preſented me at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with a fair <hi>Landskip</hi> of Delights, yet when I drew nigh to graſp the alluring Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, like the <hi>Senſitive Plant</hi> it contracted it ſelf at the <hi>touch,</hi> and <hi>ſhrink'd</hi> almoſt to nothing in
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:95868:206"/>
the Fruition. And though after the Enjoyment is paſt, it ſeems great again upon <hi>Reflection</hi> as it did before in <hi>Expectation,</hi> yet ſhould a <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Revolution</hi> make the ſame Circumſtances recur, I ſhould not think ſo. I found 'twas ever with me as with the <hi>Traveller,</hi> to whom the Ground which is before him, and that which he has left <hi>behind</hi> him ſeems always more curiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embroider'd and delightſome, than that which he <hi>ſtands</hi> upon. So that my Happineſs, like the time wherein I <hi>thought</hi> to enjoy it, was always either <hi>paſt</hi> or to <hi>come,</hi> never <hi>preſent.</hi> Methought I could often ſay upon a <hi>Recollection,</hi> How happy <hi>was</hi> I at ſuch a time! Or when I was in <hi>expectation.</hi> How happy <hi>ſhall</hi> I be if I compaſs ſuch a deſign! But ſcarce ever, I <hi>am</hi> ſo. I was pretty well pleas'd methought while I expected, while I hoped, till Fruition jogg'd me out of my pleaſing ſlumber and I knew it was but a Dream. And this ſingle Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has often made me even in the very purſuit after Happineſs, and full career of my Paſſions, to ſtop ſhort on this ſide of Fruition, and to chuſe rather with <hi>Moſes</hi> upon Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> to entertain my fancy with a remote Proſpect of the <hi>Happy Land,</hi> than to go in, and Poſſeſs it, and then <hi>Repine.</hi> How then ſhall Man be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, when ſetting aſide all the Croſſes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he will complain even of <hi>Succeſs,</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> it ſelf ſhall <hi>diſappoint</hi> him!</p>

That although at this diſtance I might frame to my ſelf bright <hi>Ideas</hi> of that Region of Bliſs; yet when I came to the Poſſeſſion of it, I ſhould not find that perfect Happineſs there which I expected, but that it would be always to <hi>come</hi> as 'tis now, and that I ſhould ſeek for Heaven even in Heaven it ſelf. That I ſhould not fully acquieſce in my condition there, but at length deſire a Change. And that which confirm'd me the more in this <hi>unhappy Scepticiſm,</hi> was, becauſe I conſider'd that a great number of excellent Beings who enjoyed the very <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of Bliſs, who were as happy as God and Heaven could make them, grew ſoon uneaſy and weary of their State and <hi>left their own Habitation.</hi> Which argues that their Happineſs was not <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe they would not have <hi>deſired</hi> a Change, ſince that very deſire is an Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And if Happineſs be not compleat in Heaven, ſure 'tis impoſſible to be found any where elſe.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Before therefore I proceed to define wherein perfect Happineſs does conſiſt, I think it neceſſary to endeavour the removal of this Scruple, which, like the flaming Sword, forbids <hi>entrance</hi> into <hi>Paradice.</hi> In order to which, I ſhall enquire into the <hi>true Reaſon</hi> why theſe Sublunary good things when enjoyed do <hi>neither</hi>

anſwer our <hi>expectations,</hi> nor ſatisfy our <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</hi> Now this muſt <hi>proceed either</hi> from the nature of Fruition it ſelf, or from the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it, or from the Object of it, or from our ſelves.

We look upon things through a falſe Glaſs, which Magnifies the Object at a diſtance much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its juſt Dimenſions. We repreſent our <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enjoyments</hi> to our ſelves in ſuch <hi>favourable</hi> and <hi>partial Ideas</hi> which abſtract from all the <hi>inconveniencies</hi> and allays which will really in the <hi>Event</hi> accompany them. And if we thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rate our <hi>Felicities</hi> before-hand, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they baulk our <hi>Expectations</hi> in the <hi>Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But then it muſt be obſerved, that the <hi>Fruition</hi> does not <hi>cauſe</hi> this <hi>Deficiency</hi> in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but only <hi>diſcover</hi> it. We have a better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into the Nature of things near at hand,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:95868:208"/>
than when we ſtood afar off, and conſequently diſcern thoſe <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>imperfections,</hi> which, like the qualities of an ill Miſtriſs, lay hid all the time of <hi>Courtſhip,</hi> and now begin to betray themſelves, when 'tis come to <hi>enjoyment.</hi> But this can never happen but where the Object is finite.

                     <p n="13">13. And as we are not to charge <hi>Fruition</hi> with our <hi>diſappointments</hi> but our ſelves (becauſe we are acceſſory to our own <hi>deluſion</hi> by taking falſe meaſures of things) ſo neither is the <hi>

that either the Object is <hi>finite,</hi> or the <hi>Fruition</hi> imperfect. But then how came the <hi>Angels</hi> to be diſſatisfy'd with their Condition in the Regions of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>immortality,</hi> when they drank freely of the <hi>Fountain of Life</hi>

                     <p n="14">14.

We are not always in Love with Pomp and Grandeur, nor always dazzled with the glittering of Riches; and there is a Seaſon when Pleaſure it ſelf ſhall Court in vain: But the deſire of perfect Happineſs has no Intervals, no Viciſſitudes, it out-laſts the Motion of the Pulſe, and ſurvives the Ruins of the Grave. <hi>Many Waters cannot quench it, neither can the Floods Drown it:</hi> And now certainly God would

never have planted ſuch an Ardent, ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Appetite in our Souls, and as it were <hi>interwoven</hi> it with our very Natures, had he not been able to ſatisfie it.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. I come now to ſhew wherein this perfect Happineſs does conſiſt, concerning which, I affirm in the firſt place, that it is not to be found in any thing we can enjoy in this Life. The greateſt Fruition we have of God here, is imperfect, and conſequently unſatisfactory. And as for all other Objects they are finite, and conſequently, though never ſo fully enjoy'd, cannot afford us perfect Satisfaction. No; <hi>Man knoweth not the price thereof: Neither is it</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 28.</note> 
                        <hi>to be found in the Land of the Living. The Depth ſaith, it is not in me, and the Sea ſaith, it is not in me.</hi> The Vanity of the Creature has been ſo copiouſly diſcourſed upon, both by Philoſophers and Divines, and is withall ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every thinking man's <hi>Experience,</hi> that I need not here take an <hi>Inventory</hi> of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nor turn <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> after <hi>Solomon.</hi> And beſides, I have already anticipated this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in what I have ſaid concerning <hi>Fruition.</hi> I ſhall only add one or two Remarks concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Objects of <hi>Secular Happineſs,</hi> which are not ſo commonly inſiſted upon, to what has been there ſaid. The firſt is this, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wherein Men generally ſeek for <hi>Happineſs</hi> here, are not only <hi>finite</hi> in their <hi>Nature,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>few</hi> in <hi>number.</hi> Indeed, could a Man's Life
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:95868:210"/>
be ſo contrived, that he ſhould have a new <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> ſtill ready at hand aſſoon as <hi>he</hi> was grown <hi>weary</hi> of the Old, and <hi>every</hi> day <hi>enjoy a Virgin</hi> Delight, he might then perhaps like Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Notion, and for a while think himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this <hi>continued Succeſſion of new Acquiſitions.</hi> But alas, Nature does not treat us with this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.

                     <p>The Enjoyments of our Lives run in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Round like the Months in the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> but with a quicker Revolution; we <hi>dance</hi> like <hi>Fairies</hi> in a <hi>Circle,</hi> and our whole Life is but a nauſeous <hi>Tautology:</hi> We riſe like the Sun, and run the ſame Courſe we did the day before, and to morrow is but the ſame over again: So that the greateſt Favourite of Fortune will have Reaſon often enough to cry out with him in <hi>Seneca, Quouſque eadem?</hi> But there is another Grievance which contributes to defeat our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after perfect Happineſs in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this Life; Which is, that the Objects wherein we ſeek it, are not only <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>few;</hi> but that they commonly prove occaſions of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:95868:210"/>
greater <hi>Sorrow</hi> to us than ever they afforded us <hi>Content.</hi> This may be made out ſeveral ways, as from the Labour of Getting, the Care of Keeping, the fear of Loſing, and the like To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, commonly inſiſted on by others; but I wave theſe, and fix upon another Account leſs blown upon, and I think more material than any of the reſt. It is this, that altho the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject loſes that great appearance in the <hi>Fruition</hi> which it had in the <hi>expectation,</hi> yet after it is gone it Reſumes it again. Now we, when we lament the loſs, do not take our meaſures from that appearance which the Object had in the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> (as we ſhould do to make our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row not exceed our <hi>Happineſs</hi>) but from that which it has in the <hi>reflexion,</hi> and conſequently we muſt needs be more <hi>miſerable</hi> in the loſs then we were <hi>happy</hi> in the <hi>enjoyment.</hi>

                     <p n="16">16. From theſe and the like <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> I think it will evidently appear, that this perfect <hi>Happineſs</hi> is not to be found in any thing we can enjoy in this Life.

And to enjoy him fully is perfect Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. This in general, is no more than what
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:95868:211"/>
is deliver'd to us in Scripture, and was believ'd by many of the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers.</hi> But the manner of this Fruition requires a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Conſideration.</hi> Much is ſaid by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon this Subject, whereof, in the firſt place, I ſhall give a ſhort and methodical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and then fix upon the Opinion which I beſt approve of. The firſt thing that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, is, that 'tis generally agreed upon among them, that this Fruition of God conſiſts in ſome <hi>Operation;</hi> and I think with very good Reaſon. For as by the <hi>Objective</hi> part of <hi>perfect Happineſs</hi> we underſtand that which is beſt and laſt, and to which all other things are to be referr'd; So by the <hi>Formal</hi> part of it muſt be underſtood the beſt and laſt Habitude of Man toward that beſt Object, ſo that the <hi>Happineſs</hi> may both ways ſatisfy the Appetite, that is, as 'tis the beſt thing, and as 'tis the Poſſeſſion, Uſe, or Fruition of that beſt thing: Now this habitude whereby the beſt thing is perfectly poſſeſs'd, muſt needs be ſome <hi>Operation,</hi> becauſe <hi>Operation</hi> is the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate perfection of every Being. Which <hi>Axion</hi> (as <hi>Cajetan</hi> well obſerves) muſt not be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as if Operation taken by it ſelf were more perfect than the thing which tends to it, but that every thing with its Operation is more perfect than without it.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The next thing which I obſerve, is, that 'tis alſo farther agreed upon among them, that this Operation wherein our Fruition of God
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:95868:211"/>
does conſiſt, is an Operation of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part, and not of the <hi>Senſitive.</hi> And this alſo I take to be very reaſonable. Firſt, becauſe 'tis generally receiv'd, that the Eſſence of God cannot be the Object of any of our Senſes. But Secondly, Suppoſe it could, yet ſince this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; wherein our <hi>perfect Happineſs</hi> does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt muſt be the perfecteſt Operation, and ſince that of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part is more perfect than that of the <hi>Senſitive,</hi> it follows that the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby we enjoy God muſt be that of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part only.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. But now whereas the <hi>Intellectual</hi> part of man (as 'tis oppoſed to the <hi>Senſitive</hi>) is double, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the <hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> or in an Act of the <hi>Will.</hi> The <hi>Thomiſts</hi> will have it conſiſt purely in an Act of the <hi>

                     <p n="25">25. I confeſs, the Practice of Vertue is a very

Hence 'tis that the worſer. Actions are accompanied with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Pleaſures. So that the good Man does not only excell the wicked Man in what is good, but has alſo the advantage of him even in Pleaſure, for whoſe ſake alone he is wicked. For he that chuſes Pleaſure with Filthineſs, altho for a while he be ſweetly and deliciouſly entertain'd, yet at laſt through the Eil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs annexed to his Enjoyment, he is brought to a painful Repentance. But now he that prefers Vertue with all her Labours and Difficulties, though at firſt for want of uſe it ſits heavy upon him, yet by the Conjunction of good be alleviates the Labour, and at laſt enjoys pare and unallay'd Pleaſure with his Vertue. So that of neceſſity that Life is moſt unhappy, which is moſt wicked, and that moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant which is moſt vertuous.</hi>

But 'tis not all the <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> of the <hi>cold Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> that ſhall work me out of the belief of what I feel and know, and rob me of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt entertainment of my Life, the <hi>Paſſionate Love of God.</hi> Whatever ſome Men pretend, who are Strangers to all the affectionate heats of Religion, and therefore make their Philoſophy a Plea for their indevotion, and extinguiſh all Holy Ardours with a <hi>Syllogiſm;</hi> yet I am firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded, that our love of God may be not only paſſionate, but even <hi>Wonderfully</hi> ſo, and <hi>exceeding the Love of Women.</hi> 'Tis an <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> and therefore <hi>undeniable</hi> Truth, that <hi>Paſſion</hi> is a great Inſtrument of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and accordingly we find, that Men of the moſt warm and pathetick <hi>Tempers</hi> and <hi>Amorous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions</hi> (Provided they have but Conſideration enough withall to fix upon the right <hi>Object</hi>) prove the greateſt <hi>Votaries</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> And upon this account it is, that to heighten our Love of God in our Religious <hi>Addreſſes,</hi> we <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi>
                        <pb n="425" facs="tcp:95868:218"/>
to <hi>excite</hi> our Paſſions by <hi>Muſic,</hi> which would be to as little purpoſe as the <hi>Fanatic</hi> thinks 'tis, if there were not ſuch a thing as the <hi>Paſſionate Love of God.</hi> But then as to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> I <hi>Anſwer</hi> with the excellent <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> that although in God who is the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>Love,</hi> we can <hi>imagine</hi> nothing, yet we can <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> that our Love, which conſiſts in this, that we would unite our <hi>ſelves</hi> to the <hi>Object</hi> beloved, and conſider our <hi>ſelves</hi> as it were a part of it. And the ſole <hi>Idea</hi> of this very Conjunction is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtir up a heat about the Heart, and ſo kindle a very <hi>vehement Paſſion.</hi> To which I add, that although the <hi>Beauty</hi> or <hi>Amiableneſs</hi> of God be not the ſame with that which we ſee in <hi>Corporeal Beings,</hi> and <hi>conſequently</hi> cannot <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> fall within the <hi>Sphere</hi> of the imagination, yet it is ſomthing <hi>Analogous</hi> to it, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Analogy</hi> is enough to <hi>excite</hi> a <hi>Paſſion.</hi> And this I think ſufficient to warrant my general diviſion of the Love of God into <hi>Intellectual</hi> and <hi>Senſitive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="31">31. But there is a more <hi>peculiar Acceptation</hi> of the <hi>Love</hi> of God proper to this place. And it is that which we call <hi>Seraphic.</hi> By which I underſtand in ſhort, that Love of God which is the <hi>effect</hi> of an intenſe <hi>Contemplation</hi> of him. This differs not from the other in kind, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>degree,</hi> and that it does <hi>exceedingly,</hi> in as much as the thoughtful <hi>Contemplative</hi> Man (as I hinted before) has <hi>clearer Perceptions</hi> and <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>
                        <pb n="426" facs="tcp:95868:219"/>
                        <hi>Impreſſions</hi> of the <hi>Divine Beauty,</hi> the lovely <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of God, than he whoſe Soul is more deeply <hi>ſet</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and lies groveling in the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>Dungeon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="32">32. That the nature of this <hi>Seraphic Love</hi> may be the better underſtood, I ſhall conſider how many <hi>degrees there</hi> may be in the <hi>Love</hi> of God. And I think the Computation of <hi>Bellarmin, lib. 2. de monachis, cap.</hi> 2. is <hi>accurate</hi> enough. He makes four. The firſt is to <hi>love</hi> God propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to <hi>his Lovelineſs,</hi> that is, with an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Love;</hi> and this <hi>degree</hi> is peculiar to God himſelf. The ſecond is to Love him, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to his <hi>Lovelineſs,</hi> but to the utmoſt Capacity of a <hi>Creature,</hi> and this <hi>degree</hi> is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to Saints and Angels in <hi>Heaven.</hi> The third is to love him not proportionably to his <hi>Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> nor to the utmoſt capacity of a <hi>Creature,</hi> abſolutely conſider'd; but to the utmoſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of a <hi>Mortal Creature</hi> in this Life. And this (he ſays) is proper to the <hi>Religious.</hi> The fourth is to love him not proportionably to his <hi>Lovelineſs,</hi> nor to the utmoſt capacity of a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> conſider'd either abſolutely or with reſpect to this <hi>Life,</hi> but only ſo as to love nothing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with him or above him. That is, not to do any thing contrary to the <hi>Divine Love.</hi> And this is abſolute indiſpenſable duty, leſs than which will not qualify us for the <hi>enjoyment</hi> of God hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="33">
                        <pb n="427" facs="tcp:95868:219"/>33. Now this <hi>Seraphic Love</hi> which we here diſcourſe of is in the third degree: When a Man, after many <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Abſtraction</hi> from the <hi>Animal</hi> Life, many a profound and ſteddy Meditation upon the <hi>Excellencies</hi> of God, ſees ſuch a vaſt <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> in him, that he loves him to the utmoſt <hi>ſtretch</hi> of his Power; <hi>When he ſits under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit is ſweet to his Taſt.</hi> Cant. 2. 3. When he <hi>Conſecrates</hi> and <hi>Devotes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whollly to him, and has no Paſſion for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <hi>Objects.</hi> When he is raviſhed with the <hi>delights</hi> of his <hi>Service,</hi> and breaths out ſome of his Soul to him in every Prayer. When he is delighted with <hi>Anthems</hi> of Praiſe and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than with <hi>Marrow and Fatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Feaſts</hi> upon <hi>Alleluiah.</hi> When he melts in a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenture of Devotion,</hi> and his <hi>Soul breaketh out with fervent Deſire,</hi> Pſal. 119. When the one thing he <hi>delights</hi> in is to converſe with God in the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and the one thing he <hi>deſires to ſee him as he is in</hi> Heaven. This is <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphic</hi> Love, and this with <hi>Contemplation</hi> makes up that which the <hi>Myſtic</hi> Divines ſtile the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> way of Religion: It is called ſo becauſe it Unites us to God in the moſt <hi>excellent manner</hi> that we are capable of in this Life. By Union here I do not underſtand that which is <hi>local</hi> or <hi>preſential,</hi> becauſe I conſider God as <hi>Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> Neither do I mean a Union of Grace (as they call it) whereby we are <hi>reconciled</hi> to

God, or a Union of Charity, whereof it is ſaid, <hi>he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God and God in him,</hi> Jo. 4. 16.

                        <note place="margin">The Great Exemplar, <hi>pag.</hi> 60.</note> 
                        <hi>a Diſcourſe without variety, a Viſion and Intuition of Divine Excellencies, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat entry into an Orb of light, and a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of all our Faculties into Sweetneſs, Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Starings upon the Divine Beauty.

But though every one muſt not expect theſe <hi>Antepaſts</hi> of Felicity that is vertuous, yet none elſe muſt. <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was never open but to a State of <hi>Innocence.</hi> But neither is that enough. No, this Mount of God's Preſence is fenced not only from the <hi>profane,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>moderately</hi> vertuous.

that if ſomtimes I happen to be in the Road, and ſomtimes in a way by my ſelf, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I affect neither the one nor the other, but write as I think. Which as I do at other times, ſo more eſpecially when I ſubſcribe my ſelf</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THE kind Entertainment which you gave my <hi>Idea of Happineſs,</hi> does not only <hi>incourage,</hi> but <hi>oblige</hi> me to endeavour the ſatisfaction of that Scruple, which the Peruſal of it has occaſion'd. I cannot but highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your <hi>ſearching</hi> Curioſity, in deſiring far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction concerning a matter of ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and excellent a Nature (for the Tree of Paradiſe is <hi>good for food, pleaſant to the Eye, and a Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe</hi>) tho you muſt give me leave to wonder that you would not <hi>enquire</hi> at a better <hi>Oracle.</hi> But ſince you are <hi>pleas'd</hi> to be of the Opinion, that few have made this Subject ſo <hi>familiar</hi> to their Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I have, I cannot with any pretence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your Requeſt, tho perhaps by my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it I ſhall work you into a contrary perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sir, You ſay you ſhould like my Notion concerning the <hi>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ality</hi> of that which is uſually
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95868:222"/>
call'd <hi>Imaginary Happineſs,</hi> that is, (as you well explain both your own and my meaning) that although the <hi>Object</hi> may be an <hi>Imaginary Good,</hi> yet the <hi>Happineſs</hi> which conſiſts in the Fruition of that Object, will not be <hi>Imaginary too,</hi> but <hi>real,</hi> and conſequently, that 'tis impoſſible for a man to <hi>ſeem</hi> to himſelf to be happy, and not to <hi>be really</hi> ſo, all Happineſs conſiſting in <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> This Notion, you ſay, you ſhould like rarely well, could you free your ſelf from one difficulty which it engages you upon; (<hi>viz.</hi>) That hereafter, in the ſtate of Glory, either one Saint ſhall think himſelf as happy as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or not; if not, this muſt needs occaſion Envy or Diſcontent, but if one ſhall think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as happy as another, then, according to my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that <hi>Opinion</hi> is the <hi>Meaſure of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> 'twill follow that he will really be ſo; and this brings in <hi>Equality</hi> of Happineſs, which you look upon (and I think juſtly too) as another abſurdity.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. I confeſs, Sir, this Argument is pretty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ſurprizing, but I conceive the Knots of it may be untied by this Anſwer. Firſt, it may be juſtly queſtion'd, whether the firſt part of your <hi>Dilemma</hi> be neceſſarily attended with the appendant abſurdity. 'Tis true indeed, not to think ones ſelf as happy as another, is the Spring of Envy or Diſcontent among Men in this World, but whether this be he <hi>genuin</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> effect of that Conſideration, or whether it
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:95868:222"/>
ought not rather to be aſcribed to the preſent Infirmities and Imperfections of Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may admit Diſpute. But in caſe this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity does inſeparably cleave to the firſt part, then I be take my ſelf to the latter, and affirm, that in Heaven one Saint ſhall think himſelf as happy as another. Then, according to my own Notion (<hi>ſay you</hi>) it will follow that he <hi>is really</hi> ſo. No, I deny the conſequence, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of which will plainly appear by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the ambiguity of the <hi>Phraſe.</hi> For this Expreſſion, <hi>One Saint thinks himſelf as happy as another,</hi> may be taken in a double ſenſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he thinks himſelf as happy as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thinks that other, or that he thinks himſelf as happy as that other thinks himſelf. I grant, ſhould one Saint think himſelf as happy as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this latter ſenſe of the Phraſe, he would, according to my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> really be ſo; ſo that this would bring in equality. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Senſe I deny the Propoſition, and that without the leaſt danger of ſplitting upon the firſt abſurdity. But for the former Senſe, <hi>that</hi> has no ſuch <hi>levelling</hi> quality, for to ſay that I think my ſelf as happy as I think another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than this, that in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion another does not exceed me in Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: but tho he does not in <hi>my apprehenſion,</hi> yet he may in <hi>reality,</hi> for tho my Opinion gives meaſures to my <hi>own</hi> Happineſs, yet it does not to <hi>another</hi> Mans. So that one Saint may be
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:95868:223"/>
ſaid to think himſelf as happy as another in the former ſenſe, without equalling the Happineſs of the Bleſſed, tho, I confeſs, I ſhould much rather adhere to the contrary propoſition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>one ſhall not think himſelf as happy as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in caſe ſuch an Opinion be not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attended with <hi>Envy</hi> or <hi>Diſcontent.</hi> Becauſe it ſeems unreaſonable to make them ignorant of the degrees of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anothers Bliſs, unleſs that ignorance be neceſſarily required to prevent the alledg'd abſurdities. But I <hi>determin</hi> nothing in this point, my buſineſs was only to break the force of your <hi>Dilemma,</hi> and to ſhew that my Notion does not involve you in the difficulty ſuppoſed. This, Sir, is all that I think neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſay to a Perſon of your apprehenſion, and therefore I end theſe nice Speculations with this profitable reflection, that altho the <hi>Notion</hi> of Happineſs be <hi>intricate</hi> and <hi>obſcure,</hi> yet the <hi>means</hi> of attaining it are <hi>plain,</hi> and therefore 'twould be moſt adviſable both for you and me <hi>chiefly</hi> to apply our ſelves to the <hi>lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here,</hi> and we ſhall underſtand the <hi>former</hi> with the beſt ſort of Knowledge, that of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, hereafter.</hi>

Sir, I ſuppoſe you can hardly forbear ſmiling at the odneſs of the Conceit, but as ridiculous as you may think it, 'tis ſaid to be maintained by no leſs a Man than <hi>Plato,</hi> and has been thought of that <hi>moment</hi> too, that <hi>Multitudes</hi> of

But now, that this Opinion was not only for its Abſurdity and Contradictiouſneſs unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the contemplative and refin'd Spirit of <hi>Plato;</hi> but was alſo apparently none of his, I dare ſay any capable Perſon will be convinc'd that ſhall heedfully and impartially <hi>examine</hi> and <hi>compare</hi> the Works of <hi>Plato;</hi> And this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> himſelf muſt needs have known (he having been his conſtant Auditour for twenty years together) but only he wanted a Shadow to fight with, and ſo father'd this monſtrous Opinion upon his Maſter.

And now, that the groſſneſs of this Abuſe may the more fully appear, I will in the next place preſent you with another Senſe of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Ideas,</hi> and ſuch as by a more than ordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his Works, I know to be the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuin</hi> one.

No, this Monſter was hatch'd in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Brain, and I believe did never enter <hi>Plato</hi>'s Head ſo much as in a Dream. For he is not only ſilent about it, but does in ſeveral places expreſly aſſert the contrary; Particularly in his <hi>Timaeus,</hi> where, of ſet purpoſe, he deſcribes the <hi>Origin</hi> of the VVorld, he ſays that God made the VVorld according to that Pattern or <hi>Idea</hi> which he had in his Mind. The ſame you will find more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply confirm'd in his <hi>Hippias,</hi> his <hi>Parmenides,</hi> and his ſixth Book of <hi>Repub.</hi> and many other places.

from their Conformity to them. And in this Senſe muſt be taken that Common Axiom of the Schools, that <hi>the Truth of a thing is its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the Divine Intellect,</hi> for it is in no other Senſe Intelligible, as you will diſcern in the Proceſs.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But now, leſt you ſhould imagine, that this <hi>Platonic Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Ideas</hi> exiſting in the Divine Mind ſhould ill comport with the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of God, or claſh with that approved Doctrine of the Schools, <hi>Nihil eſt in Deo quod non ſit Deus,</hi> (which is another cavil of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platoniſts</hi>) you are to underſtand that <hi>Plato</hi> by his <hi>Ideas</hi> does not mean any <hi>real</hi> Eſſence <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the Divine Eſſence, but only the Divine Eſſence it ſelf with this <hi>Connotation,</hi> as it is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly imitable or participable by created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and conſequently, according to the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifariouſneſs</hi> of this imitability, ſo are the <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities</hi> of Being. Which is as fine a Notion as was ever framed by the Mind of Man, and that it is his, you will find, if you conſult his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides.</hi> And this will ſerve to help us out with another difficulty, for whereas <hi>Plato</hi> makes his <hi>Divine Ideas</hi> not only the <hi>exemplary</hi> cauſes of things, but alſo (which is a conſequent to the former) the meaſure of their Truth, this may ſeem to fall in with their Opinion who make all <hi>Truth</hi> dependent upon the Speculative un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God, that is, that God does not underſtand a thing ſo becauſe it is ſo in its own
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:95868:226"/>
Nature, but that a thing is therefore ſo becauſe God is <hi>pleas'd</hi> ſo to underſtood it. Which is an Opinion full of miſchief and abſurdity, as you may ſee compendiouſly, and yet evidently demonſtrated, in Dr. <hi>Ruſt</hi>'s little <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> Now for the clearing this Difficulty, 'tis to be obſerved, that the Eſſence of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Plato,</hi> is diſtinguiſhed into <gap reason="foreign">

Now if you conſider the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as <hi>Conceptive</hi> or <hi>Speculative,</hi> it does not <hi>make</hi> its Object but ſuppoſe it, (as all <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Underſtanding does) neither is the Truth of the Object to be meaſured from its Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with <hi>that,</hi> but the Truth of <hi>that</hi> from its Conformity with its Object. But if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Divine Underſtanding as <hi>Exhibitive,</hi> then its Truth does not depend upon its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the Nature of things, but on the contrary, the Truth of the Nature of things depends upon its Conformity with it. For the Divine Eſſence is not thus or thus imitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch and ſuch things are in being, but ſuch and ſuch things are in being, becauſe the

Divine Eſſence is thus and thus imitable, for had not the Divine Eſſence been thus imitable, ſuch and ſuch Beings would not have been <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi> And thus is <hi>Plato</hi> to be underſtood when he founds the Truth of things upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the <hi>Divine Ideas,</hi> and thus muſt the Schools mean too by that foremention'd <hi>Axiom</hi> concerning <hi>Tranſcendental Truth,</hi> if they will ſpeak Senſe, as I noted above.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

The miſtakes which I obſerve are chiefly theſe. Some of the groſſer Underſtanders ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that <hi>Plato</hi> by his <hi>Love</hi> meant <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But he that ſhall from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Plato</hi> a <hi>proſtitute</hi> to that vile Paſſion, may as well conclude a <hi>Dramatic</hi> Poet to be an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt</hi> or a <hi>Whore-maſter,</hi> becauſe he repreſents thoſe of that Character. But that Divine <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> intended nothing leſs than to countenance any ſuch thing, is evident from the whole ſcope and purport of that <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and from other
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:95868:227"/>
places where he expreſly condemns it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it with great abhorrence; particularly in the firſt of his <hi>de legibus,</hi> where he calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>an unnatural attempt.</hi> Others by <hi>Platonic Love</hi> underſtand the Love of <hi>Souls,</hi> and this indeed has ſomthing of truth in it, only it is much too narrow and particular.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Others take <hi>Platonic Love</hi> to be a deſire of imprinting any excellency, whether moral or intellectual, in the Minds of beautiful young men by Inſtruction, and ſo likewiſe of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your own Perfections reflected from the Mind of another, mix'd <hi>with</hi> and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>by</hi> the Beauty of the Body. According to the uſual ſaying, <hi>Gratior è Pulchro, &amp;c.</hi> And thus <hi>Socrates</hi> was ſaid to love his beautiful Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils <hi>Phaedrus</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> Others meaſure the Nature of <hi>Platonic Love,</hi> not from the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> (to which they ſuppoſe it indifferent) but from the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Act.</hi> And according to theſe, that man is ſaid to love <hi>Platonically,</hi> that does <hi>Caſſo delectamine amare,</hi> love at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that never deſigns a <hi>cloſe</hi> fruition of the Object what ever it be, whether Senſual or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, but chooſes to dwell in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> pleaſing himſelf with remote Proſpects, and makes a <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of his own <hi>Deſire.</hi> And this is the receiv'd Notion, and that which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally mean when they talk of <hi>Platonic Love.</hi> But this too is far enough from the right, for tho <hi>Platonic Love</hi> does not aim at
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:95868:227"/>
the fruition of ſenſual Objects, yet it deſigns the fruition of its own Object as much as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Love does. That therefore which diſtinguiſhes <hi>Platonic Love,</hi> is not the <hi>manner</hi> of the act above-mention'd, but the peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Object.</hi> And what that is muſt be collected from the Deſign of <hi>Plato</hi> in that <hi>Dialogue,</hi> where he treats purpoſely of it, his <hi>Convivium.</hi> Which is briefly to ſhew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Souls aſcent to God by love. For <hi>Plato</hi> makes the Happineſs of Man to conſiſt in the Contemplation and Love of God, whom he calls the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Beauty.</hi> But now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Beauty</hi> (God) is of too ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and refined excellency to be immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſtned upon by our Love, he recommends to us <gap reason="foreign">

This laſt indeed is a very vile, brutiſh, unmanly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſuch as conſidering the vileneſs of our Bodies, one would think a man could never be charm'd into without the <hi>Magic</hi> of a <hi>Love-potion.</hi> But the former is an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affection, for certainly Beauty is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine thing; It is (as the <hi>Platonic</hi> Author ſays of Wiſdom) <hi>the pure Influence flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, and the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Everlaſting Light:</hi> or in <hi>Plato's</hi> own Words, <hi>A Ray of God.</hi> And therefore the Love of abſtract Beauty muſt needs be a very generous and divine Affection.

                     </opener>
                     <p n="1">TO the firſt of your Enquiries concerning the true Idea of <hi>Love,</hi> and particularly that between Man and Woman, and wherein it ſtands diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>Luſt,</hi> my Anſwer in ſhort is this. That Love may be conſider'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther barely as a <hi>Tendency</hi> toward <hi>good,</hi> or as a <hi>willing</hi> this good to ſomthing capable of it. If Love be taken in the firſt Senſe 'tis what we call <hi>Deſire,</hi> if in the ſecond, 'tis what we call <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> or <hi>Benevolence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then as to <hi>Deſire,</hi> there is either an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual or a ſenſual deſire, which denomination is not here taken from the <hi>Faculty,</hi> but from the <hi>Quality</hi> of the <hi>Object.</hi> That I call here an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Deſire whoſe object is an <hi>Intellectual</hi> good, and that a ſenſual deſire whoſe object is a <hi>ſenſual</hi> good. And this is that which <hi>Plato</hi> meant by his two Cupids. The latter of theſe is what we call <hi>Luſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. But then this again ſignifies either abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indifferently (<hi>viz.</hi>) a bare deſire of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal pleaſure, or elſe concretely and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (<hi>viz.</hi>) a deſire or longing after corporeal pleaſure in forbidden and unlawful inſtances.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="447" facs="tcp:95868:229"/>4. Theſe things being thus briefly premiſed my next Reſolution is this. That the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Paſſion of Love, that which we mean when we ſay ſuch a man or ſuch a woman is in <hi>Love,</hi> is no other than plain <hi>Luſt,</hi> if Luſt be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt ſignification, namely, for a ſenſual Deſire, or a Tendency toward a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual good. But if Luſt be taken in the latter ſenſe, as a Tendency to corporeal pleaſure in unlawful inſtances, that which our Saviour meant when he ſaid <hi>He that looks upon a woman to luſt after her,</hi> &amp;c. then 'tis not neceſſary that the Paſſion we here ſpeak of ſhould be <hi>Luſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then 'twould be a ſin to be in <hi>Love,</hi> and conſequently, there would be a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in order to <hi>Marriage,</hi> becauſe no man is ſuppoſed to marry but whom he <hi>thus</hi> Loves.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And now to your 2d Enquiry, whether Muſic be a Senſual or Intellectual pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this can be determin'd, the Idea of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and Intellectual pleaſure muſt be ſtated.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And 1ſt I obſerve that the preciſe <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of a ſenſual pleaſure cannot conſiſt in this, that the Body be pleaſed or gratefully affected, nor of an Intellectual that the Mind be pleaſed. For by reaſon of the ſtrict union of Soul and Body, one ſo ſympathizes with the other, that theſe pleaſures are always <hi>Mutual</hi> and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. So that there is no pleaſure of mind that does not alſo recreate the Body, and no pleaſure of Body but whereof the Mind has its
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95868:230"/>
ſhare. And thus far there is agreement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation. That then which is <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>diſcriminative</hi> muſt be taken from the <hi>Primary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Secondaryneſs</hi> of the Perception. That Pleaſure therefore is an Intellectual Pleaſure when the Soul is primarily and immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and the Body only ſecondarily and by participation. And that is a ſenſual pleaſure when the Body is primarily and immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and the Soul only ſecondarily and by participation.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now according to this Meaſure we muſt of neceſſity define the pleaſure of hearing Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic to be properly <hi>Intellectual.</hi> Becauſe the Soul is the part that is then primarily and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly affected, and the Body only by reſult. And that for this evident Reaſon, becauſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic conſiſting <hi>formally</hi> in Proportion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion pleaſing only as <hi>underſtood,</hi> that part muſt be primarily and directly pleaſed which is capable of underſtandiug. But this is not the Body but the Soul. 'Tis true indeed the ear may be directly pleaſed by a <hi>ſingle</hi> ſound, as the eye is recreated by a ſingle Colour (ſuppoſe <hi>green</hi>) and this I grant to be a pleaſure of ſenſe as much as ſmelling or taſting, tho not ſo groſs. But the Ear may no more properly be ſaid to be pleaſed with the <hi>Proportion</hi> of ſounds, or with ſounds as <hi>proportionate,</hi> than the eye is with a <hi>Picture.</hi>
                     </p>

of Senſe becauſe 'tis <hi>convey'd</hi> by the <hi>Ear,</hi> I reply that if this be ſufficient to make a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Senſual, the moſt Intellectual pleaſures we are here capable of may be call'd Senſual, as reading fine diſcourſes, contemplating the Beauty of the Creation, attending to Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Diagrams and the like, becauſe all theſe as well as Muſic are enjoy'd by the <hi>Mediation</hi> of the Senſes.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. But it matters not tho the Senſes be the <hi>Inſtruments of conveyance,</hi> ſo the Soul be the part <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>primarily</hi> affected, which is the caſe here. For tho the Ear may be pleaſed with thoſe ſingle ſounds which with relation to each other are really Harmonical, yet it is not, it cannot be pleaſed with them as ſuch, or in that <hi>Formality.</hi> This is the ſole Priviledge of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which as it can only <hi>judge</hi> of, ſo is it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of being <hi>pleas'd</hi> with <hi>Harmony.</hi>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p n="1">1. TO your Queſtion whether in propriety of ſpeaking there may be <hi>ſtrict Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> between a <hi>man</hi> and his <hi>wife,</hi> I anſwer firſt that the ſolution of this Queſtion depends upon another, (<hi>viz.</hi>) what are the Requiſites eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary to the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Friendſhip, and this Queſtion likewiſe depends upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (<hi>viz.</hi>) what is the true <hi>Notion</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of Friendſhip. This being rightly ſtated, 'twill be eaſy to diſcern what are the eſſential <hi>Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> and conſequently whether Man and Wife are capable <hi>Terms</hi> in this Relation or no.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now as to the <hi>Idea of Friendſhip,</hi> I anſwer firſt in general, that Friendſhip is nothing elſe but <hi>Benevolence</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> under ſome certain <hi>Modifications</hi> or accidental circumſtances. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental</hi> I mean as to <hi>Charity,</hi> tho <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> And thus far I think all Moraliſts are agreed. But now what theſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Modifications are, here they begin to be divided. 'Twould be too tedious a work to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt here upon the variety of other mens Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and therefore I ſhall only briefly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my own, which is, that all the Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Charity</hi> neceſſary to the conſtitution of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:95868:231"/>
                        <hi>Friendſhip</hi> may be well enough reduced to theſe three. 1. That it be in a ſpecial manner <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe,</hi> 2ly, that it be <hi>mutual,</hi> and 3ly that it be <hi>manifeſt</hi> or <hi>mutually known.</hi> Charity when cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe three Modifications immediatly commences <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> More than theſe it need not have, but of theſe not one may be ſpared, as will eaſily appear if you examine them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now from this <hi>Idea</hi> of Friendſhip 'tis very obvious to deduce what are the <hi>Requiſites</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Friendſhip, not in reference to its <hi>Idea</hi> (for that's already ſtated) but in reference to its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> or <hi>actual Exerciſe,</hi> that is in one word, what are thoſe <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> or <hi>Aptneſſes</hi> in the <hi>Subject</hi> whether as to perſon, ſtate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which may render it capable of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip according to the foremention'd <hi>Idea.</hi> Now I ſay what theſe are may be eaſily collected from the <hi>Idea</hi> it ſelf, as will appear if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it diſtinctly according to thoſe three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications, and by applying the genus to each of them. For 1ſt whereas Friendſhip is ſaid to be Charity in a ſpecial manner intenſe, hence I collect 1ſt, that it cannot be but between good men, becauſe an ill man cannot have any true Charity, much leſs ſuch an intenſe degree of it as is requiſite to Friendſhip. So that <hi>Vertue in general</hi> is one Requiſite. 2ly, hence I collect that a Friend muſt not be only according to the Character <hi>Lucan</hi> gives of <hi>Cato—rigidi ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi>
                        <pb n="452" facs="tcp:95868:232"/>
                        <hi>honeſti, rigidly vertuous</hi> and honeſt, but he muſt be alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a man of a <hi>liberal,</hi> ſweet, obliging temper, one of thoſe <hi>good</hi> men of whom 'tis ſaid in Scripture (by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to the <hi>Righteous</hi> or rigidly honeſt) that ſome would even dare to <hi>dye</hi> for them. For tho I may have <hi>common</hi> Charity, nay more, a great <hi>Eſteem</hi> for a man of plain honeſty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, yet I can never love him with that <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intenſeneſs</hi> of Affection which belongs to <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> unleſs he be alſo of a beneficent, kind and obſequious temper. So that <hi>good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is another requiſite. 3ly, hence I collect that there muſt be alſo (at leaſt in a competent proportion) an <hi>agreeableneſs of humours</hi> and <hi>manners,</hi> for unleſs the materials be of an apt and correſpondent <hi>figure,</hi> the building can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>compact</hi> nor <hi>laſting,</hi> ſo that <hi>likeneſs of diſpoſition</hi> is another Requiſite. 4. hence I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that true Friendſhip cannot be among <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> For ſince our faculties are of a <hi>finite</hi> ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, 'tis impoſſible our love can be very intenſe when divided among many. No, the rays muſt be <hi>contracted</hi> to make them <hi>burn.</hi> So that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Requiſite is, that the Terms of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be <hi>few in Number.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Theſe are all the Requiſites that I can think of at preſent deducible from the firſt part of the <hi>Idea</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Charity in a ſpecial manner intenſe) As for fidelity in retaining ſecrets, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Adherence and the like, I think they
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:95868:232"/>
are vertually included in the firſt Requiſite, it being hardly conceivable how a man can be good and vertuous that wants them. But if you think the Reduction not ſo obvious, you may if you pleaſe add them here in the fifth place as diſtinct Requiſites, 'twill be all one. Thus far of the Requiſites deducible from the firſt part.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To proceed. Whereas it is further ſaid that Friendſhip is a Benevolence that's <hi>Mutual,</hi> there is but one general Requiſite deducible from this, which is, that all the other be found in both (or if more) in all the perſons ſuppoſed to be Friends. The third of which importing <hi>Relation</hi> will of neceſſity be ſo, for all <hi>Similitude</hi> is <hi>mutual.</hi> Laſtly, whereas 'tis ſaid that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a Benevolence <hi>mutually known,</hi> all that will be Requiſite upon this head is, that the Perſons who are to be confederated in this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have ſuch opportunities of Converſe or Correſpondence, that they may be ſatisfy'd of the <hi>Degree</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of each others love.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Having thus ſtated the <hi>Idea of Friendſhip,</hi> and from thence deduced all the neceſſary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in the ſubject for its <hi>entertainment,</hi> I think I may now from the Premiſes venture to affirm that there may be <hi>ſtrict Friendſhip</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Man and Wife.</hi> For which of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites is it that they muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> want? As for your Objection taken from their <hi>inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> I grant Equality is wanting both as to <hi>Sex</hi>
                        <pb n="454" facs="tcp:95868:233"/>
and as to <hi>Conjugal Relation,</hi> but neither is <hi>all</hi> Equality <hi>neceſſary.</hi> 'Tis not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Friends ſhould ſtand upon a <hi>Level,</hi> either in reſpect of Fortune, State or Condition. This ſort of Equality I grant is a <hi>good Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> for a more eaſy <hi>Introduction</hi> of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and 'tis alſo advantagious to the <hi>laſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of it, but yet 'tis diſpenſable. 'Tis like levelling the ground betwixt two rivers, it makes way for a more <hi>eaſy</hi> union, but yet 'tis poſſible from <hi>Earthquakes, Floods</hi> or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies they may be united without it. The only equality that is neceſſary is an equality of <hi>diſpoſitions,</hi> an harmony of <hi>affections,</hi> but this may be in perſons of <hi>unequal fortunes</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. I confeſs, there can be no ſuch thing as Friendſhip between perſons of different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity if the Superiour takes <hi>advantage</hi> of his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence</hi> or Authority, for then 'tis true what the Poet ſays, <hi>Si vis Sexte coli, non amabo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. But then 'tis not the being <hi>inveſted</hi> with ſuperiority that is inconſiſtent with Friendſhip (for then Kings who have no equals but thoſe of <hi>other Kingdom's</hi> with whom they cannot inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately converſe, would be the miſerableſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alive) but the <hi>habitual uſe</hi> and <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it, and the ſtanding upon its <hi>priviledges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. But there is no neceſſity that it ſhould be ſo. <hi>Friendſhip</hi> may <hi>level</hi> thoſe whom <hi>Fortune</hi> has made <hi>unequal,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>Monarch</hi> in the world may find Opportunities to deſcend
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:95868:233"/>
from the throne of majeſty to the familiar Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of a <hi>dear Favorite,</hi> and <hi>unking</hi> himſelf a while for the more glorious title of <hi>Friend.</hi> 'Tis but to apply this to the particular caſe in hand, and you have a Solution to your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And now Sir from the <hi>Theory</hi> of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I ſhall moſt readily deſcend to the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of it when ever you pleaſe to employ the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of</p>

                     <p n="1">1. SInce 'tis one of the happineſſes of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Communicate <hi>ſorrow</hi> as well as to ſhare in <hi>joy,</hi> that the one may be <hi>increas'd</hi> and the other <hi>diminiſh'd,</hi> I cannot but betake my ſelf to this eaſy refuge, being at preſent in ſuch a condition, as will need more relief and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port than I can either <hi>give</hi> to <hi>my ſelf,</hi> or <hi>receive</hi> from <hi>others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The truth is, ſhould I indulge my paſſion, I might find perhaps as much cauſe as he that did it, to curſe the day of my <hi>Nativity.</hi> My pretty little dear <hi>Neece</hi> and <hi>Scholar,</hi> ſhe whom I loved, admired and delighted in, ſhe for whoſe ſake I once thought <hi>life,</hi> as now I think <hi>death</hi> a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> ſhe (how ſhall I bring out that diſmal word)—is dead.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. She is, and has left a ſtrange emptineſs in my Soul (ſo large was the room ſhe took up there) which nothing of this world's good can ever fill. I muſt needs own that I never was ſo deeply affected with any trouble in my life, nor did I ever think that it could be in the power of any <hi>temporal</hi> loſs ſo much to diſcompoſe and <hi>unſpirit</hi> my Soul. It is not a tranſient <hi>guſt</hi> of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which like a little cloud would either ſoon
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:95868:234"/>
                        <hi>blow over,</hi> or <hi>ſpend</hi> it ſelf in a <hi>momentary ſhower,</hi> but 'tis with my <hi>mind</hi> as with the <hi>face</hi> of the <hi>sky</hi> when 'tis all <hi>ſet</hi> to rain. Were it only an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>Animal</hi> part, it would ſoon vaniſh like the <hi>phantaſtic colours</hi> of the <hi>Rain-bow,</hi> but my grief is of a more malignant kind, and penetrates even into the very <hi>Center</hi> of my Soul. 'Tis lodg'd (as <hi>Lipſius</hi> I remember emphatically phraſes it) <hi>in ipſa animi mente,</hi> 'tis an <hi>ingrain'd, rational</hi> and <hi>Judicious</hi> ſorrow.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I lament not on <hi>her</hi> account (for I cannot, without reflecting upon the <hi>divine goodneſs,</hi> queſtion the happy ſtate of one who was nothing but <hi>innocence</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi>) but purely upon my <hi>own.</hi> And that I do in ſuch a meaſure that—but 'tis in vain to go about to expreſs it, for I lov'd her as I lov'd my own Soul, and however my <hi>ſorrow</hi> may be blam'd for her <hi>now,</hi> yet I'm ſure my <hi>love</hi> for her <hi>could not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. For ſhe was a perſon (and you know I am not <hi>over-prone</hi> to <hi>admire</hi>) ſo <hi>peculiarly</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd, as if Nature had deſign'd nothing elſe in her compoſition but to make one <hi>on purpoſe</hi> to be <hi>belov'd.</hi> As for her outward form, ſhe was one of the <hi>ſtudied</hi> and <hi>elaborate</hi> pieces of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by the very air of her Countenance was <hi>markt out</hi> for an <hi>extraordinary Soul</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit in. Nor was the <hi>Jewel</hi> unworthy of the <hi>caſe,</hi> for certainly ſhe had as excellent a Spirit (one only excepted) as ever condeſcended to wear human fleſh. Her parts were miraculous
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:95868:235"/>
and extraordinary, ſo extraordinary, that had not the <hi>youth</hi> and <hi>verdancy</hi> of her face <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted</hi> the <hi>ripeneſs</hi> of her <hi>diſcourſings,</hi> you would have thought her <hi>well in years.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. And tho <hi>Art</hi> had little more to do where <hi>Nature</hi> had been ſo <hi>eminently liberal,</hi> yet ſo <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetuous</hi> was ſhe as well as <hi>Capable</hi> of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if ſhe meant to graſp all manner of knowledge, and leave nothing to a future ſtate to add to her accompliſh'd Soul. And indeed 'tis too incredible to be related, conſidering the ſhortneſs of the time (for her pulſe had not beat thirteen years) what a wondrous progreſs her active Soul had made. Thus far only I ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in general, that had ſhe lived to be as ripe in <hi>years</hi> as ſhe was in <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>ingenious attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſhe would have been the <hi>envy</hi> of her <hi>Sex,</hi> and the <hi>wonder</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. But yet the <hi>former</hi> of theſe would have been much abated by her admirable <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>good nature.</hi> A Quality as of it ſelf <hi>moſt excellent,</hi> ſo that wherein ſhe <hi>moſt excell'd.</hi> And here I muſt beg leave of all that I ever convers'd with to declare, that I never obſerv'd in any, ſuch a free, generous, obliging and diſintereſs'd temper, which mightily <hi>ſweetned</hi> and <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> her <hi>parts,</hi> and made her not only <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,</hi> but <hi>lovely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. And beſides all this there were in her (as in <hi>Poetry</hi>) many <hi>errantes abditaeque veneres,</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and hidden graces that want a name, and
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:95868:235"/>
                        <hi>unexpreſſible Prettineſſes,</hi> which yet were ſtrangely moving, and of a charming influence. I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any partial fondneſs, or Rhetorical affectation in any one part of this Character, but as near as I can do ſpeak the genuin, unprejudiced ſenſe of my Soul. I hate to flatter the <hi>living,</hi> much more the <hi>dead,</hi> whoſe <hi>names</hi> are as ſacred to me as their <hi>ſepulchers.</hi> My only fault here (if any) is in the <hi>defect,</hi> for ſhe was as much too good to be <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently commended,</hi> as to be <hi>long enjoy'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. And now (ſetting aſide that particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which ſhe ever bleſt and honour'd me with) how can I chuſe but be very paſſionately concern'd for the loſs of ſuch a rare and every way accompliſh'd perſon! I cannot, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks when I ſurvey the <hi>ſuddain ruin</hi> of my <hi>pleaſant,</hi> but <hi>ſhortliv'd gourd,</hi> I can hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear juſtifying my <hi>grief</hi> as the <hi>inraged Prophet</hi> did his <hi>Anger,</hi> and like him am <hi>tempted</hi> to ſay, <hi>I do well to be ſorrowful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. But I muſt not be ſo <hi>ill a Pilot</hi> as now the floods of Paſſion ariſe to throw away my <hi>tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> commit my Veſſel to the winds, and run along with the tempeſt; <hi>ſatis naturae datum eſt, jam &amp; Ratio ſuum aſſerat Principatum.</hi> For my ſhip begins to be cover'd with the waves, and therefore 'tis now high time to awake <hi>Reaſon</hi> from her <hi>dead ſleep,</hi> that ſhe may <hi>rebuke</hi> the <hi>winds</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> that they may be <hi>calm and ſtill.</hi> 'Tis dangerous to indulge any longer, the tumult of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:95868:236"/>
the Paſſions runs high, and the unruly Faction preſſes hard upon the gate of the Palace, 'tis therefore time for the <hi>Soveraign Faculty</hi> to come forth in her imperial robes, &amp; ſuppreſs the <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">11. In order therefore to the quieting of my paſſions, and the reſettlement of my diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Soul, I conſider, Firſt, that <hi>grief</hi> is the moſt abſurd and ſenſeleſs of <hi>all the Paſſions,</hi> yea of all the things in the world, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming a Creature that makes the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion to <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe 'tis reſolvable into no rational Principle; for whatever is ſo muſt be, or at leaſt <hi>appear</hi> to be either an <hi>End</hi> or a <hi>Means.</hi> But this can pretend to neither. Not to be <hi>end,</hi> for nothing is ſo but what is <hi>good,</hi> but this is in <hi>no reſpect good,</hi> and in <hi>many reſpects evil.</hi> Not to be a <hi>Means,</hi> becauſe it <hi>effects nothing,</hi> but is altogether <hi>vain and fruitleſs.</hi> And indeed it cannot but be ſo, becauſe 'tis of a thing <hi>paſt,</hi> which even to <hi>Omnipotence</hi> it ſelf is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be <hi>alter'd.</hi> Our <hi>other Paſſions</hi> are to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and aim at ſome end. <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>enjoy, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> to <hi>revenge, Fear</hi> to <hi>avoid,</hi> and the like; But this Paſſion, <hi>grief,</hi> ſerves to no end or purpoſe in the world, and it cannot be its <hi>own end</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I ſaid before) it is in no reſpect <hi>good.</hi> It is therefore utterly abſurd and unreaſonable.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Again I conſider, that ſuppoſe grief were not ſo <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>ineffective</hi> a thing as 'tis, but that it could make ſome <hi>alteration</hi> in things,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:95868:236"/>
yet it cannot alter any one event for the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and therefore to what purpoſe ſhould I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge it? For ſince we acknowledg a Being of an infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs to ſit at the <hi>Helm</hi> of the univerſe, it muſt be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uently acknowledg'd that the courſe of this world is ſteer'd to the beſt advantage of the <hi>whole,</hi> and however ignorant we may be how to juſtify <hi>particular Phenomena's,</hi> yet we muſt (if we will be conſiſtent with our former conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) at leaſt <hi>implicitly</hi> believe that all things are as well as they can poſſibly be. Certain it is (whatever ſome <hi>Male-contents</hi> may think) the world is <hi>govern'd</hi> with as much wiſdom as 'twas <hi>made,</hi> and as the <hi>natural world</hi> ſtood the teſt of the <hi>divine Criticiſm,</hi> ſo will the <hi>Moral one</hi> too. God upon review would pronounce <hi>this as good</hi> as he did the <hi>other,</hi> and why ſhould not <hi>we?</hi> yea we ſhould, if we could ſee this excellent <hi>Drama</hi> from end to end as <hi>he does;</hi> we ſhould then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that all thoſe diſpenſations which <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi> taken appear harſh and unequal, yet in <hi>Concatenation</hi> and <hi>together</hi> conſpire to the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Intereſt of the <hi>whole. This</hi> will be our portion <hi>hereafter,</hi> in the mean time 'twill be our greateſt wiſdom to truſt <hi>that</hi> of God, and believe that implicitly as to the <hi>thing,</hi> which we cannot diſcern as to the <hi>manner.</hi> And this I take to be the moſt rational foundation of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and Acquieſcence</hi> in the divine pleaſure, which is grounded upon a Conſideration of his
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:95868:237"/>
infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> When we reſolve our wills into his merely for this reaſon, becauſe we pay ſo much deference to his perfections, as to think, that if we knew as much as he, we ſhould not wiſh things to be otherwiſe than they are. And this is highly ſpecify'd in the Saints in Heaven, who through that near and intimate view which they have of God's <hi>perfections</hi> are ſo intirely conformable to his <hi>will,</hi> that they can diſpenſe not only with the <hi>eternal loſs</hi> but <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of their <hi>friends</hi> without the leaſt grief or reſentment. I confeſs, this eminency of reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is no more attainable in this life than any other part of Celeſtial happineſs, but yet an heedful and attentive meditation of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may do much towards it; And howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver difficult it be to reduce it to <hi>Practiſe,</hi> yet 'tis moſt certain in the <hi>Theory</hi> that granting the ſuperintendency of an infinite and unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd underſtanding, and that every calamity is (as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſomwhere calls it) <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſent from God, to grieve at any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is to grieve that things are as they ſhould be. Which is one would think, too abſurd for him to be guilty of who is defined to be <hi>a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. Again I conſider, that as that which I call an affliction is (as certainly as God is Wiſe and Good) for the beſt in reference to the <hi>whole Syſteme of things,</hi> ſo for all that I know it may be moſt conducive to <hi>my intereſt in particular.</hi>
                        <pb n="463" facs="tcp:95868:237"/>
In as much as by it I may either <hi>obtain a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good,</hi> or <hi>avoid a greater evil.</hi> Thus a <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck</hi> made <hi>Zeno</hi> a Philoſopher, and the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan</hi> proved and Antidote to the great Apoſtle againſt <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> of Spirit. And perhaps there was in me ſome evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortify'd quality or other of ſo malignant a nature that it could not be cured by a leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Application. For certainly God is not ſo <hi>ill a Phyſitian</hi> as not to <hi>weigh</hi> the Ingredients of his <hi>bitter Cup,</hi> before he mingles it into a <hi>draught,</hi> that it may be proportionable to the ſtrength of the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> as well as of the <hi>Patient.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. Again I conſider, that as this affliction may be one of the <hi>Arrows</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of God be intended for <hi>my particular good,</hi> ſo 'tis moſt certain that by wiſe conduct I may extract good out of it if I will, and turn it to my greater advantage. <hi>Plato</hi> I remember ſomwhere compares the life of man to a <hi>game at Tables.</hi> And indeed the compariſon is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the wiſdom of its Author, and full of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic and important truth. For as <hi>there</hi> what <hi>Caſt</hi> we ſhall have is not in our power, but to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it well, that is. So is it with man in the concerns of life. 'Twas not in my power whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Affliction ſhould befall me or not, but 'tis in my power to manage it for my advantage now it has befall'n me. I can uſe it as an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing my Vertue, as an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of withdrawing my affections from the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:95868:238"/>
world confidering the uncertainty of the <hi>beſt</hi> objects in it, of increaſing my love to God, and his <hi>love</hi> to me <hi>here,</hi> and his <hi>rewards</hi> to me <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi> And to this purpoſe I conſider the ſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who for his readineſs to part with his beloved Son at the demand of God, became the <hi>Favorite</hi> and <hi>Friend</hi> of his maker, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd this emphatical promiſe from him, <hi>In bleſſing I will bleſs thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. Again I conſider, that altho by the loſs of this excellent Creature a <hi>great breach</hi> be made upon my <hi>happineſs,</hi> yet the remainder of what I <hi>enjoy</hi> is much greater than the evil which I <hi>ſuffer,</hi> ſo that upon the <hi>whole</hi> the Scale <hi>weighs down</hi> for <hi>happineſs.</hi> My Condition is ſtill better than that of many others, who yet think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy. And therefore for me to pine and lament becauſe I am not <hi>ſo</hi> happy as I <hi>was,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> be, becomes neither the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of a <hi>Scholar,</hi> nor the <hi>Humility</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Principle I may continue to lament even when I am in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Rather let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the bounty of God for filling my Cup <hi>ſo full,</hi> than be diſcontented becauſe it does not <hi>run over.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. Again I conſider with the great Apoſtle that <hi>the time is ſhort,</hi> and that therefore I ſhould <hi>weep as if I wept not.</hi> 'Twill not be long e're I ſhall enjoy the Beatific Viſion of God and (if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the fruition of any Creature can be of any moment) the Society of even this dear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:95868:238"/>
In the mean while I have one Artifice more whereby to ſolace my ſelf, and that is, by entertaining the ſame apprehenſion of what I enjoy as I ſhould do if I <hi>did not enjoy it.</hi> I think with my ſelf, how miſerable I ſhould be if I wanted ſeveral of thoſe Bleſſings which I have, particularly if I had not been bred a <hi>Scholar,</hi> and thereby been qualify'd to be my <hi>own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</hi> And by vertue of this Conſideration I ſet a <hi>higher value</hi> upon what I <hi>enjoy,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently find the <hi>leſs miſs</hi> of what <hi>I do not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. This is my <hi>Conſolatio Philoſophica,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I allay and <hi>fix</hi> the violent <hi>fermentation</hi> of my Paſſions. To which I might add many <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> Arguments, as that 'tis as natural to <hi>dye</hi> as to be <hi>born,</hi> that 'tis incident not only to <hi>man</hi> but to the <hi>whole Creation, the faſhion of this world paſſes away,</hi> that 'tis <hi>envious</hi> to think <hi>that our loſs</hi> which is <hi>our friend's gain,</hi> that occaſions of grief in this world are <hi>many,</hi> and therefore not <hi>ſingly</hi> to be <hi>much</hi> lamented, that 'tis a <hi>ſhame</hi> for <hi>Reaſon</hi> not to be able to conquer that which muſt at length yield to <hi>time,</hi> and the like. But theſe I ſhall be content only to mention, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe I don't fancy much to be <hi>Topical,</hi> and partly becauſe I think my <hi>other ſupports</hi> ſtrong enough to bear the <hi>ſtreſs</hi> of the moſt <hi>weighty ſorrow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. And now the reſult of all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations is this. I am fully and intirely ſatisfy'd with the accompliſhment of the divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:95868:239"/>
and tho before 'twas my hearty prayer that (if poſſible) <hi>this Cup might paſs from me,</hi> yet I now as chearfully ſubſcribe to the other clauſe, <hi>Nevertheleſs not as I will but as thou wilt.</hi> I am thoroughly convinc'd both of the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and undecency of my former ſorrow, and tho not ſo much a <hi>Stoic</hi> as to condemn <hi>all the paſſions,</hi> yet I do this of <hi>grief</hi> as freely as any of that rigid School, and therefore will no longer <hi>defile my ſelf for the Dead.</hi> Lev. 21. 1. If any grief can be now reaſonable, it muſt be becauſe I have griev'd ſo much, for I am conſcious that I have thereby exceedingly betrayd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Soul. <hi>Homer</hi> indeed thought it not unworthy the Character of his great Hero <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> to bring him in paſſionately bewailing the death of <hi>Patro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clus.</hi> His expreſſion (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) is <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>he wept hideouſly.</hi> But certainly our Saviour was of another mind, when he ſaid to his Diſciples upon the occaſion of his <hi>own</hi> death (and certainly if <hi>any</hi> thing could <hi>juſtify</hi> ſorrow <hi>that</hi> would) <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
