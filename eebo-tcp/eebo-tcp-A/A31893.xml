         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian Readers.</head>
            <p>IF the Heathen Moralist <hi>Plutarch</hi> could
say, <q>
                  <hi>Meditation</hi> is as it were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of decaying knowledg; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as forgetfulness seems to be the
egress of knowledg, <hi>Meditation</hi> doth
restore a new memory instead of that which
passeth away; and so preserve knowledg,
that it is in effect the same, in that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
mutations, it leaves something new,
and like it self, resembling that which is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:</q>
How may a Christian, endow'd with
the true knowledg of God, say with the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist</hi>
in the revival of it, Psal. 104. 34. <hi>My
meditation of him shall be sweet.</hi> When he is
alone, and hath no other companions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
himself with, then he may (as Bishop
<hi>Hall,</hi> who penn'd a part of his <hi>Meditations</hi>
under the solitary Hills of <hi>Ardenna</hi>) from a
renewed mind, send forth his active thoughts,
those immediate rays of that <hi>Candle of the
Lord</hi> within him, to contemplate upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
Saviour, and Sanctifier, and reflect upon
himself, who is to survive the visible Creation,
and so raise himself into an <hi>Heaven upon earth,</hi>
relish such sweetness as the carnal mind and
<pb facs="tcp:65780:3"/>
sensual heart, immersed in dreggy matter, and
be-dull'd therewith, is never so happy as to
attain. The <hi>Author</hi> of this little Treatise,
whose great and pious soul was notably hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venliz'd
by the frequent exercise of <hi>holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi>
the very same who penn'd <hi>The Godly
mans Ark,</hi> which hath been often printed for
the support of drooping Christians, amongst
other excellent discourses upon various sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in the exercise of his Ministry with great
success, did from his own experience recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this of <hi>Meditation,</hi> whether <hi>ejaculatory</hi>
and <hi>occasional,</hi> or <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>deliberate.</hi> I am
not ignorant, that many other eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
persons of great worth and honour,
have already notably display'd the excellency
and usefulness of this way of thinking; yet
perhaps this grave and famous Preacher in his
day, hath in a more easie method, and plain
way, by his familiar expressions and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
suited to vulgar capacities, here help'd
the real Christian, who would most delight in
the <hi>Duty,</hi> to put <hi>Meditation</hi> in practise, than
any who hath gone before him. No doubt,
had this excellent person himself published
this discourse here presented to your view,
you would have had it every way more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
by the lopping off some superfluities,
and amending of phrases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more proper
for a <hi>Writer,</hi> than these of a <hi>Preacher</hi> to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb facs="tcp:65780:3"/>
Auditory; yet such as it is, considering
the <hi>Author</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> you'l find when you
have read it through, it doth fully as much
resemble Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> in his preaching at <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury,</hi>
to your minds, as the <hi>Engraver</hi> on
the <hi>frontispiece</hi> hath represented his <hi>face</hi> to
your eyes. I dare say any of you who were
his <hi>Auditors,</hi> will be abundantly satisfied, tho
this piece be posthumous, yet it is genuine.
And seeing <hi>there is joy in heaven over one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that repenteth, more than over ninety nine
just persons which need no repentance,</hi> Luk. 15. 7.
If these <hi>practical Sermons,</hi> taken by the swift
pen of a <hi>ready writer,</hi> have such an influence
upon any, as to bring them to the frequent
and beneficial practise of <hi>Meditation,</hi> which
the <hi>Preacher</hi> of them held necessary: None
who prefer <hi>things</hi> before <hi>words,</hi> and esteem
<hi>real knowledg</hi> above elegancy of speech, as the
<hi>general good</hi> of mankind, beyond that of any
particular Countrey, can justly think the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
wrong'd; but rather that with Dr. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Fenner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> &amp;c. (some of
whose Works popularly deliver'd with plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
suited to the capacities of their hearers,
and taken but rudely from their mouths, did
more benefit Readers of meaner abilities, than
those which whiles alive, they themselves pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
with greater exactness) He is renown'd,
when he hath by this more diffusive good-work
<pb facs="tcp:65780:4"/>
been any way instrumental to have <hi>God and
the things of heaven</hi> (where he now resides)
more delightfully thought upon. As judicious
<hi>Calvin</hi> in his Epistle to the King of <hi>Swethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
prefixed to his Commentary on the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Prophets,</hi> said he would not be so morose
a <hi>Censor</hi> of manners, as to obstruct the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that Commentary delivered in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporal
kind of speaking, when design'd
only for his own private Oratory, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to have come abroad; only as 'twas pen'd
from his mouth by <hi>Budaeus, Crispin,</hi> and <hi>Ionvil,</hi>
because he said, he had long before learn'd not
to serve the theater of the World: else, he
doth afterwards tell the <hi>Reader,</hi> that if in his
other works which he had written deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and succinctly with much more pains, he had
met with envious malignants, who did carp at
and quarrel them, he might well endeavour to
suppress that work, taken by the aforesaid wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
after him, as it was freely utter'd to his
own hearers for present use; yet when others
assured him, that it would be a loss (yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious)
to the Church, if not printed as it
was taken, rather than not at all; He thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
having not time nor strength to transcribe
or amend it, readily permitted it to go to the
Press. And the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> hath since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
in the benefit of having it as it was
published; yea, and to this day Divines who
<pb facs="tcp:65780:4"/>
have made great use of it since in their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi>
as well as others, to find the true
true meaning of the Holy Writ, have heartily
blessed God for it. Yet as Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi> hath
observ'd in his Epistle to <hi>the Real Character,
Foreigners</hi> in <hi>Short-Writing</hi> come far behind
us here in <hi>England</hi> (though it hath been now
seventy years invented) where they admire
the skill of our Writers, and whither the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of other Nations frequently come and
learn our Language, chiefly to understand our
<hi>Practical Sermons,</hi> many of which have been
only preserv'd in this way, You have this ('tis
to be hoped very useful) piece, taken well
from the mouth of Mr.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not unknown unto
you, I suppose, that there
are <hi>two</hi> things required by
God of all those that would
receive the benefit of the
Sacrament: the <hi>one</hi> is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
before they come;
and the <hi>other</hi> is <hi>meditation</hi>
when they are come. I have made many and
many a Sermon of <hi>Preparation,</hi> but I have
made very few of <hi>Meditation.</hi> Now the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is a meditating Ordinance, as I may
so express my self; it is an Ordinance for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation:</hi>
and the great work that we have to
do at the Sacrament, is to meditate upon
Christ crucified; and therefore I shall crave
leave to make you a few Sermons concerning
this rare and excellent Doctrine of <hi>Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and for this purpose I have chosen this
<hi>Text:</hi> Wherein we have <hi>four</hi> Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65780:10"/>
1. We have the <hi>person</hi> that is here spoken
of, and that is <hi>Isaac,</hi> the godly child of godly
<hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What is here related <hi>of this person, he</hi>
went out to meditate.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The place</hi> that he chose for his meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that was in the <hi>field,</hi> he <hi>went out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the field to meditate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>The time</hi> that he chose to meditate in,
and that was the <hi>evening,</hi> and <hi>Isaac went out
to meditate in the field at the eventide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great <hi>question</hi> for the meaning of this
<hi>Text</hi> will be, what the <hi>subject</hi> of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
was? what did <hi>Isaac</hi> go out to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon? now for this you must know
there is a <hi>double meditation;</hi> there is a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that is <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>wicked;</hi> and there is a
meditation that is <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>godly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>meditation</hi> that is <hi>sinful and
wicked,</hi> and that is when we meditate upon
things that are wicked; of this you shall
read, <hi>Psal. 36. 4. He deviseth mischief upon
his bed.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 7. 14. Behold he travelleth
with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief.</hi>
There are wicked meditations as well as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
conversations; and a man may go to Hell
for <hi>plotting</hi> wicked things, as well as for <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising</hi>
wicked things. And therefore it is said,
<hi>Prov. 12. 2. A man of wicked devices will God
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65780:10"/>
condemn.</hi> Not only a man of wicked practises,
but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.
There is a contemplative wickedness as well
as an actual wickedness; and a man may go
to Hell for contemplative wickedness. As for
example, there is a contemplative murder,
when a man doth delight in the <hi>thoughts of
murdering</hi> his brother; when the thought of
revenge is pleasing. And there is a <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
adultery,</hi> when a man doth plot how to
commit adultery, and delight in the thought
of adultery. Now <hi>Isaac</hi>'s meditation certainly
was not of things that are wicked, he did
not go out into the field to meditate upon
vile and wicked things.</p>
            <p>2. There is a <hi>meditation that is holy and
godly,</hi> and that is when we meditate upon
things that are holy and heavenly; and of this
nature was the meditation of <hi>Isaac,</hi> he went
out into the field to meditate on the works
of God, and of the blessings and mercies of
God; to meditate upon the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi>
and upon his sins; and this appears, because
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word that is here used for <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
that is here translated <hi>meditation,</hi> doth
also signifie to <hi>pray;</hi> and therefore it is in
your margent, <hi>And Isaac went out to pray at
eventide.</hi> It was a Religious work that <hi>Isaac</hi>
went out about; and you must know that
Prayer and Meditation are very well joined
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65780:11"/>
together; Meditation is a preparation to
Prayer, and Prayer is a fit close for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and <hi>Isaac</hi> went out to meditate, to pray
and to meditate, and to meditate and pray.
This Meditation was a holy and heavenly act
of <hi>Isaac.</hi> So then the <hi>Observation</hi> I shall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this:</p>
            <p>Observ. <hi>That the meditation of holy and
heavenly things is a work that God requires at
the hands of all people.</hi> That God that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
you to pray, requires you to meditate
as well as pray; there are few Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> That <hi>God that requires
you to hear Sermons, requires you to meditate
on the Sermons you hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. God requires this of you that are <hi>young
Gentlemen,</hi> and therefore here you read of
<hi>Isaac,</hi> that he went out to meditate. Now
though it be true that <hi>Isaac</hi> at this time was
<hi>forty</hi> years old, yet in those days to be of
forty years was to be but a young man, for
<hi>Isaac</hi> lived an <hi>hundred and fourscore</hi> years; and
therefore this is a notable pattern for young
Gentlemen, to imploy their time in godly and
holy meditation.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>This is a duty that God requires of</hi>
Kings, of Nobles, and of great persons; <hi>and
therefore</hi> David, <hi>though he was a King, and
had a great deal of work and business, yet he
saith of himself,</hi> Psal. 119. 15. I will medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65780:11"/>
in thy precepts. v. 23. Princes also did sit
and speak against me, but thy servant did medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
in thy statutes. v. 48. I will meditate in
thy statutes.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>This is a duty that God requires at the
hands of</hi> Soldiers, and Generals, and Captains,
Iosh. 1. 8. <hi>there God speaks unto</hi> Ioshua, This
book of the Law shall not depart out of thy
mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and
night, that thou maist observe to do according
to all that is written therein, for then thou shalt
make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have
good success.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>It is a duty that God requires of all</hi>
Learned men, <hi>and of all that are Scholars,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 15. Give attendance to reading and
exhortations, and meditate upon these things:
give thy self wholly unto them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>This is a duty that God requires of</hi>
Women; <hi>and therefore it is said of</hi> Mary,
Luk. 2. 19. She kept all these sayings, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them in her heart. v. 51. But his mother
kept all these sayings in her heart. <hi>That is, she
meditated upon them. In a word, it is a duty
that God requires of</hi> all <hi>that look for Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Psal. 1. 1. Blessed is the man that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat
of the scornful, but his delight is in the Law of
the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day
and night.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65780:12"/>
            <p>Now you must know there are <hi>two sorts of
Divine meditation,</hi> there is a <hi>sudden, short,
occasional meditation</hi> of Heavenly things; and
there is a <hi>solemn, set, deliberate meditation.</hi>
I shall crave leave to speak something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>first</hi> sort of meditation, which I
call <hi>sudden and ejaculatory, extemporary and
occasional meditation;</hi> and I shall shew you
<hi>three things</hi> concerning this.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>I will shew you</hi> what this ejaculatory
and extemporary meditation of Divine things
is, and the excellency of it.</p>
            <p>2. I will give you some <hi>examples of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>I will give you some</hi> motives to perswade
you to the practise of it.</p>
            <p>1. I will discover to you what I mean by
that I call <hi>occasional and extemporary, sudden
and ejaculatory meditation.</hi> Occasional medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is this, when a man takes an <hi>occasion</hi>
by what he sees, or by what he hears, or by
what he tasts of; when he takes an occasion
by any thing that is sensitive, to raise up his
thoughts to Heavenly meditation. Or take it
thus, Occasional meditation is when a man
makes use of the Creature, as a footstool to
raise him up to God, as a ladder to Heaven;
when a man upon the sudden makes use of
what he sees with his eyes, or hears with his
ears, as a ladder to climb to Heaven withal.
You have a pattern of this, <hi>Psal. 8. 3, 4. When
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65780:12"/>
I considered thy heavens, the work of thy singers,
the Moon, and the Stars, which thou hast or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi>
(mark what is his meditation of this)
<hi>what is man that thou art mindful of him? and
the son of man that thou visitest him?</hi> Lord,
what is man that thou shouldest make the
Heaven, the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars
for his sake? You must know, that all the
whole Creation is a picture of God; it is
Gods Looking-glass, wherein you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the God of Heaven and Earth; there is
no Creature but it hath the Image of God
upon it; there is not the least spice of grace
but you that are spiritual may read God in it.
—It is the saying of a Heathen, <hi>Every
herb that you have in your Garden doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Divinity,</hi> or nature of God. There
are <hi>two</hi> books that God hath given us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
to know him by, the book of the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and the book of the <hi>Creature;</hi> now
though the book of the Scripture be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
book of the two, and the book of the
Scripture will teach us more of God than the
book of the Creature; for the book of the
Creature cannot teach us God in Christ, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
teach us the mystery of Redemption, nor
the mystery of the Trinity; yet the book of
the Creature is a rare book, wherein a man
may learn excellent things concerning Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and heavenly things, excellent instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65780:13"/>
I remember a story of a godly man,
<hi>Antony,</hi> that was driven into the Wilderness
for Religion sake, and having no book at all
in the Wilderness, he was asked, <hi>How he
could spend his time?</hi> saith he, <hi>I have one
book, and that is the book of the Creation; and
as long as I have this book I want no other book;</hi>
Speaking how much he could behold God in
that book. And it is a good saying of <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
The same God is the God of nature that is
the God of grace.</hi> And it is the duty of a
Christian to receive instruction, and spiritual
benefit from natural things as well as from
gracious and spiritual things, because there is
the same God of nature as of grace. The
Creatures of God are a Divine Book
in which we may read the <hi>power</hi> of God,
the <hi>goodness</hi> of God, the <hi>love</hi> of God, the
<hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>wisdom</hi> of God,—<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20.
That that may be known of God may be read
in the Creature. Now the Creatures are but
Spectacles by which we are enabled to read
these things concerning God. I have read a
story of a Painter, <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> he was a rare
man for that Art, and coming into a Painters
shop, he sees a line drawn so curiously, that
he crys out, Surely <hi>Apelles</hi> hath been here;
none but <hi>Apelles</hi> could draw such a curious
line. And as the story saith, he went out of
theshop, and never left till he had founb out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65780:13"/>
this <hi>Apelles,</hi> that so he might come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of that man that had so much
skill. The application of this is most excellent,
when you look upon this Creature of God,
and that Creature of God, you must needs
confess that none but a God could make such
a glorious world; <hi>digitus Dei est hic,</hi> here is
the finger of God; and the consideration of
this, if you have any thing of God in you,
will make you to seek out after this God, and
to love this God, and honour this God.</p>
            <p>2. I will give you some examples of this
<hi>occasional, sudden, extemporary meditation of
Divine things:</hi> First, I will give you <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
examples,</hi> Prov. 6. 6. there the wise man
sends the sluggard to the Pismire, <hi>Go to the
Ant thou sluggard, consider her ways, and be
wise, which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
provideth her meat in the summer.</hi> Here you
see what a rare <hi>meditation</hi> a man may have
from the little Pismire, and how the sluggard
is sent to behold the Pismire, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of his sluggishness; let the sight of
that put thee in mind of thy laziness. <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 7.
there God sends the unthankful <hi>Israelite</hi> to
the <hi>Stork,</hi> and the <hi>Turtle,</hi> and the <hi>Crane,</hi> and
the <hi>Swallow: The stork in the heaven knoweth
her appointed time, and the turtle and the crane,
and the swallow observe the time of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
Here you have a <hi>sudden and occasional
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65780:14"/>
meditation</hi> from the Creatures of God, the
Turtle, the Crane, the Swallow, observe the
time of their coming; the Stork at such a time
of the year goes out of the land, and at such
a time of the year comes into the land; <hi>but
my people</hi> (there is the meditation) <hi>know not
the judgments of the Lord.</hi> And thus Christ
sends the distrustful Christian to the <hi>fowls of
the air,</hi> and to the <hi>lillies of the field,</hi> Mat. 6. 26.
<hi>Behold the fowls of the air for they sow not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they reap nor gather into barns, yet your
heavenly father feedeth them,</hi> (here is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional
meditation) <hi>are you not better than many
sparrows? And why take you thought for rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
consider the lillies of the field how they
grow, they toil not, neither do they spin, and
yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like one of these.</hi> You
have another example, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. where Christ
discoursing with the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and
intreating some water from the Woman, takes
an occasion from the <hi>water</hi> of the Well to
discourse of the <hi>water of life.</hi> And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.
from the <hi>loaves</hi> Christ fed the people withal,
he takes an occasion to discourse of the bread
of life, <hi>You follow me for the loaves,</hi> saith
Christ; <hi>but labour not for the meat that perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
but labour for the meat that endureth for
ever. I am the bread of life that came down
from heaven.</hi> Christ takes occasion from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65780:14"/>
natural bread to meditate on the bread of
life, the bread of heaven. To give you some
other examples, I read in St. <hi>Austin,</hi> that he
had a water-course near his lodging, a great
flowing down of waters; and observing how
<hi>sometimes</hi> the water went down silently, <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi>
made a great noise; from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the different streaming of the water,
he made a rare discourse of the <hi>Order of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
the manner how God governs the
World in order. There was a Minister,
Mr. <hi>Deering</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, a man
of famous memory, in whose Life it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that just when he was a dying, <hi>the Sun
shone upon him;</hi> and he takes <hi>occasion</hi> from
that most excellently to discourse of that <hi>Sun
of Righteousness,</hi> of <hi>the glory of heaven,</hi> of the
<hi>happiness he was going to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have likewise read, that Mr. <hi>Eske,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> (who in his Book of <hi>Meditation</hi>
doth quote this example) were hearing a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
of Musick, and this holy Minister Mr.
<hi>Eske</hi> being a very godly man, all on a sudden
was so strangely transported with the thoughts
of the joys of Heaven, that he said with a
great deal of passion, <hi>What musick, Sirs, shall
there be in heaven! O the spiritual joy and
melody that there we shall have!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a story of two Cardinals in the
Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> that riding abroad for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65780:15"/>
their Recreation, they saw a <hi>poor Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
weeping,</hi> and when they came to him,
they askt him, <hi>Why he wept?</hi> saith he, <hi>Do
you see this Toad here that lies before me, God
might have made me a Toad; I am weeping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I never was sufficiently thankeful that God
did not make me a Toad;</hi> (you see this poor
Country-man takes an occasion from the sight
of the Toad to raise up his heart in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God) and these two Cardinals when
they heard him say so, they made use of the
speech of St. <hi>Austin, The poor and labouring
men get to heaven, and we Scholars go down to
hell with all our learning.</hi> They were ashamed
to see what a good use the Country-man
made of the sight of the Toad.</p>
            <p>There is another story of a <hi>godly old man,</hi>
that beholding a <hi>harlot</hi> how curiously she
trimmed her self to please her wicked lover,
he falls weeping, and being askt, <hi>Why he
wept?</hi> saith he, <hi>I weep to see this leud woman
what care she takes to dress her self to please her
lover, and that I should never take so much care
to dress my soul to please my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have read of <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr, that
when he heard the Clock strike, he would
have this meditation, <hi>Now there is one hour
more that I must answer for.</hi> I have read of
<hi>Fulgentius</hi> that rare Scholar, that when he
came to Heathenish <hi>Rome,</hi> and saw the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65780:15"/>
ride in Triumph, he brake out into
this Exclamation, <hi>If there be so much glory in</hi>
Rome <hi>here upon earth, O what will be the glory
of Heaven!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might be infinite in these stories; only I
will give you one more, and that is of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-man,
<hi>Galen,</hi> famous for his skill in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick;</hi>
when he was viewing the <hi>composure</hi> of
mans body, and beholding the curious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of it, the story saith he fell to sing a
Hymn to his Creator, <hi>None but a God could
make such a body; there must needs be a God
that hath wrought so curiously the members of
mans body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Give me leave to give you some <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
to perswade you to the <hi>practise of this.</hi>
It is in vain to hear my Discourses, unless you
endeavour to put them in <hi>practise.</hi> Now I
will give you these <hi>Motives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This way of <hi>meditation may be done at
all times,</hi> this will not hinder your calling; you
that are poor men, and have not time for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
meditation on the week-day, that are
labouring men, and cannot spare an hour for
solemn and deliberate meditation, you may
make use of this sudden, ejaculatory, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
meditation, even when you are at your
day-work; you may make use of your day-work,
of the things that you are <hi>working a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,</hi>
to stir up your hearts to Heavenly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65780:16"/>
things; for there is nothing in the world but
a good Christian may make a Heavenly <hi>use</hi> of;
and therefore there is no body can say that
he hath no leisure for this way of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>2. This is a <hi>way of meditation,</hi> that a man
<hi>may practise in all places, and in all companies.</hi>
A godly man once said unto me, <hi>I thank God
I can be in heaven when I am in the midst of
the croud in Cheapside; in the midst of the
noise I can have a heavenly meditation.</hi> There
is no place, no company, can hinder thee
from this <hi>occasional,</hi> sudden, ejaculatory me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
            <p>3. There is nothing <hi>more easie</hi> than <hi>this
ejaculatory meditation to you that are spiritual;</hi>
deliberate and solemn meditation is very hard
and difficult; but this way of meditation is
very easie; and the <hi>reason</hi> is this, because
there is no Creature of God but is a teacher
of <hi>some good thing;</hi> thou canst not behold a
<hi>Spider</hi> but thou maist make some good use of
it; the Scripture doth make many rare uses of
a <hi>Spider;</hi> a wicked man may be lookt upon
in a <hi>Spider,</hi> as in a glass; and the hope of a
wicked man is compared to a Spiders web; as
a Spider puts his trust in his web, and spends
a great deal of pains in weaving his web, and
when it is woven, it is easily pull'd down,
there is no stability in it; so a wicked man
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65780:16"/>
puts his trust in his hope of Heaven, which
is as vain as a Spiders web. And the Scripture
tells you how by all the money a wicked man
gets by unlawful means, he doth but weave a
Spiders web. That is a rare use the Prophet
<hi>Isaiah</hi> makes of the <hi>Spiders,</hi> which is one of
the meanest of all the Creatures of God; a
Spider and a Toad, and a Viper, even the
venomous Creatures, a man may make rare
use of, <hi>Isa. 59. 5, 6. They hatch cockatrice eggs,
and weave the Spiders web: he that eateth of
their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed
breaketh out into a viper. Their webs shall not
become garments, neither shall they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their works.</hi> That man is a very
bad Scholar that can spell nothing out of <hi>ten
hundred thousand books,</hi> for every Creature is
as it were a book to teach us some good thing;
Now that man is but a very ill Scholar that
can make use of none of these books.</p>
            <p>4. Herein lies the <hi>excellency of a Christian,
that he is able to spiritualize natural things:</hi>
Herein lies the wickedness of a wicked man,
a wicked man doth naturalize spiritual things.
But herein lies the godliness of a godly man;
a godly man doth <hi>spiritualize</hi> natural things; a
wicked man <hi>carnalizeth</hi> even spiritual things;
when he is at the Ordinances, at the very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
if he be not truly godly he doth
carnalize and naturalize even that spiritual
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65780:17"/>
Ordinance of the Sacrament; but a godly
Christian is like a Heavenly <hi>Alchymist,</hi> that
can draw Heaven out of a <hi>Spider</hi> as it were,
draw something of God out of a <hi>Toad,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
instructions out of a <hi>Toad,</hi> out of a
<hi>Viper,</hi> out of any Creature of God, much
more out of the <hi>Heavens, Sun, Moon</hi> and
<hi>Stars.</hi> You wonder at the <hi>Chymist,</hi> when he
can extract all the <hi>four Elements</hi> out of a mixt
body; much more excellent is that <hi>Christian</hi>
which can extract <hi>heaven</hi> out of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, that can <hi>heavenlize</hi> and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize
the Creatures of God. And let me tell
you a little to amplifie this <hi>motive;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Herein a true <hi>Christian exceeds the bruit
beasts;</hi> the bruit beasts can enjoy the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but he cannot reflect upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
he enjoys the good things of God, but
he <hi>cannot behold God</hi> in these things, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
improve them for God; but now a true
Christian makes all these things to be glasses
to see God in, pictures to behold God in;
the Goodness of God, and the Wisdom of
God; and he endeavours to receive spiritual
instruction by them.</p>
            <p>2. Herein a <hi>child of God exceeds all wicked
men;</hi> there is no wicked man can use the
Creatures spiritually, it is above his <hi>sphere;</hi>
a wicked man makes the Creatures a wall of
separation between God and him, not a glass
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65780:17"/>
to see God; there is no wicked man useth the
Creatures of God as a <hi>looking-glass</hi> to behold
God in, or as a <hi>footstool</hi> to raise him up to God,
or a <hi>ladder</hi> to climb to God by, this is proper
only to a godly man.</p>
            <p>5. Consider this, <hi>It is the greatest affront
you can offer to God, not to take spiritual notice
of his creatures;</hi> not to make a spiritual use of
his Creatures. God hath put mankind upon
the stage of this world, and God hath made
all the Creatures for mans use, and God hath
made man to be the tongue to praise him for
all his Creatures; and if man doth not praise
him, God loseth the praise of all the whole
Creation. God made all the Creatures for
man, and man to praise him for all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
which if man neglect, God loseth the
glory of the whole Creation; for how doth
the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> praise
God! The Prophet <hi>David</hi> calls upon the <hi>Ice,</hi>
and the <hi>Snow,</hi> and the <hi>Rain,</hi> and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God, to praise God: How do they
praise God? How doth the <hi>fire</hi> and the <hi>water</hi>
praise God? When we praise God for these
things, then <hi>they</hi> praise God when we use
them for God, and draw Heavenly things, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
instruction out of them; and when we
do not do this, we offer the greatest affront
that can be offered to God in that kind, and
we deprive God of the glory of the whole
Creation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65780:18"/>
6. <hi>It is a soul-destroying sin not to observe the
works of God, and to make a good use of them.</hi>
Psal. 28. 5. <hi>Because they regard not the works
of the Lord, nor the operation of his hand, he
shall destroy them, and not build them up.</hi> These
are the <hi>six motives.</hi> Now in a word to put an
end to this Discourse, let me beseech and
intreat you, that you would put this duty in
practise; let me tell you, Sirs, that though <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional,
ejaculatory meditation</hi> be but as a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis</hi>
(as one very well saith) in your
worldly businesses; yet this <hi>Parenthesis</hi> is
more worth than all your worldly business;
yea, it signifies more than all your worldly
business. As for <hi>example,</hi> (I will conclude my
Discourse by giving you a little help): When
<hi>I rise in a morning;</hi> what an excellent thing
were it for a man to meditate of the <hi>great
morning of the Resurrection,</hi> and that it shall
be as easie for men to <hi>rise out of the grave</hi> at
the great Resurrection, as it hath been for me
this morning to arise out of my bed. And
when the <hi>Sun</hi> begins to arise, and we behold
the Sun shining, what a rare meditation is it
to consider there will a day come wherein the
<hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> shall come in the clouds,
and all his holy Angels with him, and all the
Saints at that day shall shine as so many <hi>Suns</hi>
in the firmament. O what a glorious day will
that be, when there shall be as many <hi>Suns</hi> as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65780:18"/>
there are <hi>Saints!</hi> there shall be as many <hi>Suns</hi>
as there are <hi>Stars</hi> now in a bright shining
night in the Heaven. And when thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad, it would be very come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
spiritual and useful to remember, that thou
hast <hi>two companions</hi> always going with thee,
that is <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> (pardon me that I
join them together) thou hast thy <hi>judg</hi> and
thy <hi>accuser</hi> to go with thee; wheresoever thou
walkest in the day time, one <hi>Devil</hi> or other
is always waiting upon thee, and <hi>God</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
present with thee, who will call thee to
an account for all that thou dost; and the
Devil scores up all that thou dost, for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuse
thee afterward. And when thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
abroad and seest a debauched wicked man,
it is an excellent thing to have a <hi>meditation,</hi>
and to say, Blessed be God that hath made me
to <hi>differ</hi> from this man; if it had not been
for the <hi>grace of God,</hi> I had been as wicked as
this man. And when thou meetest with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, a man eminent for godliness, Oh put
up a prayer to God that he would make thee
as <hi>godly;</hi> and mourn that thou art not as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he. When thou meetest with a learned
man, or a wise man, or a beautiful creature,
it is a very excellent meditation to consider,
if there be so much beauty, so much wisdom
in the creature, O what is there in <hi>God,</hi> who
is the ocean of beauty! if there be so much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65780:19"/>
comeliness, so much excellency here below,
Oh what is there above! It is a rare thing to
use the <hi>creatures reflexively;</hi> it is Idolatry to
use the creature <hi>terminately;</hi> but the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the superlative excellency of a Christian
is to use the Creature <hi>reflexively;</hi> to reflect
from the Creature to the Creator. So likewise
when thou art in thy <hi>Shop,</hi> and weighing thy
Commodities, would it not be an excellent
<hi>meditation,</hi> to think there will a time come,
<hi>when God will weigh thee in a ballance, and
weigh thy actions, and weigh all that thou dost!</hi>
And <hi>meditate on that Text,</hi> Prov. 11. 1. <hi>A false
ballance is an abomination to the Lord.</hi> And so
likewise when you walk in the <hi>fields,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the <hi>grass</hi> that grows, and behold the
<hi>flowers</hi> of the field, doth it not become you
to meditate, <hi>that all flesh is grass, and all the
glory of the world is but the goodliness of the
grass;</hi> and all earthly things are but like the
beauty of a flower? My little Child that I
love so much, is but like this flower, it is
beautiful, but it is but fading. And when
thou seest a wicked man grow great by
wicked ways, would it not be a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
thing to remember that Text, <hi>Fret
not thy self because of evil doers, neither be thou
envious against the workers of iniquity, for they
shall be soon cut down as the grass, and wither
as the green herb.</hi> And you that are <hi>Merchants,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65780:19"/>
when you are upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> a short
<hi>sudden ejaculation</hi> would not be hurtful, but
helpful to you. As for example, to remember
that as you are <hi>Merchant-adventurers</hi> for
earthly things, so you are all <hi>Merchant-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers
for heaven,</hi> and your souls are in the
midst of the Sea of this world; this world is
like a Sea, and your soul is here like a ship
at Sea, and is in danger to be split upon
the rocks, in danger of pirates, and in
danger of being lost. Your <hi>Ships</hi> have not
half so many dangers as your Souls have; the
temptations of the Devil, the allurements of
the world, the corruptions of your own
hearts. Now to consider, as in the <hi>Exchange,</hi>
what is become of such and such a Ship, so to
ask thy soul <hi>in what case is thy soul now,</hi> that
is on the Sea of this world; and then to go
to the <hi>Ensuring-office,</hi> (you know you have
your Ensuring-offices, wherein you ensure
your Ships at Sea) to get your souls ensured
by reconciliation with God; and by true faith,
manifested by holiness and righteousness, to
get your souls assured, that they may come safe
to the haven of Happiness.</p>
            <p>In a clear bright frosty Winter-night, when
thou goest out and beholdest the <hi>bespangled
heaven,</hi> multitude of bright Stars, what a
rare thing were it to <hi>meditate,</hi> This glorious
bespangled Firmament is but the stable as it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65780:20"/>
were, but the <hi>out-houses</hi> of that Heaven where
I am to go; it is but the outward Court, but
the Wash-house, as I may say; and if the
Stable and Out-houses be so glorious, Oh
what is the <hi>inward palace!</hi> above the spangled
Heavens is my Fathers house, where I hope
to live for ever with God, and there my
Christ is now interceding for me, and by the
power of his Spirit shall I be brought one day
to that house; Oh when will that time come!
when will my soul mount thorough these
Heavens into the heaven of Heavens! Now
is not this comely for a Christian? will not
this <hi>heavenlize you, and spiritualize you?</hi> And
then when you go to <hi>bed at night,</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I have <hi>one day more to answer for;</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
there will a <hi>last night come,</hi> after which
there will be no day but the Resurrection
of all. Remember thy <hi>last night,</hi> thy <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
night,</hi> the end of thy life.</p>
            <p>But I have been over-long in this, a great
deal more than I thought; but I do it because
here I shall put an end to this discourse of
<hi>occasional meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>second sort of Meditation,</hi> and
that is that that I call <hi>set, solemn and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;</hi>
when a man <hi>sets apart an hour</hi> a day it
may be, sets a part some time, and goes into
a private Closet, or a private Walk, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65780:20"/>
there doth solemnly and <hi>deliberately meditate
of the things of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning this <hi>meditation,</hi> I shall
handle by Gods assistance these <hi>two</hi> Particulars:</p>
            <p>1. I will shew you the <hi>nature of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I will shew you the <hi>necessity of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>nature of this duty,</hi> what this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
is, that I would press you to: I will
describe it in <hi>two</hi> Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. This holy <hi>meditation is a dwelling and
abiding upon things that are holy;</hi> it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a knowing of God, and a knowing of
Christ, but it is a dwelling upon the things
we know; as the <hi>Bee</hi> that dwells and <hi>abides
upon the flower, to suck out all the sweetness</hi> that
is in the flower; so to meditate upon God and
Christ, and the Sacrament, it is to dwell upon
God, and the Sacrament, to <hi>suck out all the
sweetness</hi> we can in the things we meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As we read of <hi>Anna,</hi> Luk. 2. 37. <hi>She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Temple praying and fasting day
and night.</hi> To meditate, is to continue and fix
our selves and our hearts upon the things we
know; this meditation in Scripture is called
<hi>a holy musing,</hi> Psal. 39. 3. <hi>My heart was hot
within me, while I was musing;</hi> to meditate is
to muse, or else it is to <hi>commune</hi> with our
own hearts, <hi>Psal. 4. Stand in awe and sin not:
commune with your own heart upon your bed,
and be still.</hi> It is a communing, a consulting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65780:21"/>
with our own hearts; or if you will, it is a
<hi>bethinking</hi> our selves: so it is expressed, 1 <hi>King.</hi>
8. 47. <hi>If they shall bethink themselves in the
land whither they were carried captive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi>
The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word is, if they shall bring
back to their hearts, if they shall reflect upon
themselves; for meditation is a <hi>reflecting act
of the soul, whereby the soul is carried back to it
self, and considers all the things that it knows.</hi>
Meditation is an inward act of the soul, a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
act, whereby the soul doth recoil upon
it self, and looks back upon it self, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
all the things that concern its everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
happiness; and if I be not mistaken, it is
rarely typified under the Law <hi>two manner of
ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By those beasts that did <hi>chew the cud;</hi>
you shall read <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. of the clean beasts, and
the unclean beasts; now the clean beasts were
such as did chew the cud, of those they were
to eat: now the unclean beasts were those
that did not chew the cud: a <hi>meditating Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is one that chews the cud,</hi> that chews on
the Truths of Jesus Christ, that doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hear good things, but when he hath heard
them, chews them over, ruminates upon them,
that so they may be fitter for digestion and
concoction, and spiritual improvement; an
unclean Christian is one that doth not chew
the cud, that doth not ruminate, and ponder,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65780:21"/>
and bethink himself of the things of Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. Another type of this rare grace of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
is that of the Beasts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. that
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw, <hi>that had eyes within and without,
Vers. 18. their wings were full of eyes round
about them.</hi> And so likewise the Beasts
<hi>Rev 4. 6. Round about the Throne were four
beasts full of eyes before and behind:</hi> A notable
and a rare type of Meditation; for meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is nothing else but a looking thoroughly
into the things of God; <hi>a looking before and
behind,</hi> as I may so speak; a meditating Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
is a man full of eyes, that doth not only
know God, but sees much of God. There is
another <hi>metaphor</hi> to express it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119 59.
<hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet
unto thy testimonies:</hi> The word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
is taken from Chapmen, that when they buy
a commodity, they turn it over, and over, and
over again; they look all about it into every
part of it. <hi>Meditation is a thorow contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and a thorow consideration of the things
of God; a meditating Christian is full of
eyes, full of heavenly understanding.</p>
            <p>2. It is an <hi>act of the heart as well as of the
head;</hi> it is not only a <hi>speculative</hi> knowledg of
things Divine, but a <hi>practical</hi> knowledg; it
is not only an act of the <hi>intellect and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
but of the <hi>will and affections;</hi> it is
an <hi>affective</hi> grace as well as an <hi>intellective</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:65780:22"/>
grace; and therefore it is said of the Blessed
Virgin <hi>Mary, She pondered all these sayings in
her heart;</hi> she did not only think of them with
her head, but she pondered on them with her
heart; and you shall read, <hi>Deut. 4. 39. Know
therefore this day, and consider it in thy heart.</hi>
A true meditation is when a man doth so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
of Christ as to get his <hi>heart</hi> inflamed
with the love of Christ; so meditate of the
Truths of God, as to be transformed into
them; and so meditate of sin as to get his
heart to hate sin; when it is such a musing of
God, as kindles a fire in the whole soul, as
<hi>David</hi> doth express it, <hi>Psal. 39. 3. While I
was musing, the fire burnt:</hi> When a man doth
so contemplate on God, that his heart is all on
fire with the love of God; when a man doth
so think on the Sacrament, that his heart is all
on a fire with a holy thirsting after the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
When the heart is affected with the
meditation of the head; and therefore <hi>David</hi>
saith, <hi>Psal. 104. 34. My meditation of him
shall be sweet;</hi> this is the true meditation,
when we do so meditate of God, as to taste a
sweetness in God; when meditation doth not
rest in the intellectual part, but flows into
the will and affection, that the heart is all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
with the things we meditate on. There
are many great <hi>Scholars</hi> that meditate much of
God, and Christ, and Heaven, and yet they
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65780:22"/>
are never the holier for their meditation;
and the reason is, because they meditate on
these things meerly to find out curious noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, and Christ, and Heaven, but
they do not meditate on these things <hi>to get
their hearts affected,</hi> to get Heavenly and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hearts; and therefore you shall see many
Scholars as undevout, and as unholy as other
people, though they know more, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
more. And I have found it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that there are many <hi>poor lay-people,</hi> that
get more good by meditation than great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
for the great Scholar his meditation
many times vanisheth into empty <hi>speculations,</hi>
and into notions and opinions; but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
godly man his meditation is all for <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi>
he meditates of <hi>sin</hi> to hate it, of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
to hunger after it, of <hi>God</hi> to love
him, of <hi>Christ</hi> to be inflamed with a desire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him. And therefore he gets the more good
many times by meditation. The <hi>Butterflie</hi> will
dwell upon the flower as well as the <hi>Bee,</hi> but
the <hi>Butterflie</hi> only sucks the flower that she
may <hi>paint</hi> her wings with it; she is not useful
to make <hi>honey,</hi> she doth not suck honey from
the flower; so there are many <hi>Scholars,</hi> many
men that meditate much of the things of God
to paint their wings, that is, to get more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God and Heaven, and more curious
expressions of Heaven, but it is the honest
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65780:23"/>
Christian, the plain-hearted Christian, that
meditates of God like the <hi>Bee,</hi> to suck out
the sweetness of God; that meditates on
Christ so as to get his heart burning in love
to Christ; this is the rare grace of meditation.
<hi>Meditation must enter into three doors,</hi> or else
it will never do you any good.</p>
            <p>1. It must get into the <hi>door of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
and there it is seated, there is the
proper place of meditation; but if it rest
there, thou art never the better for it.</p>
            <p>2. It must get into the <hi>door of thy heart,</hi>
and of thy affections; and thou must never
leave meditating till it get into that door
likewise.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>door of thy conversation;</hi> for thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
must not rest in the affections; but it
must likewise have influence into thy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
to make thy conversation more holy;
thou must so meditate of God as to walk as
God walks; and so to meditate of Christ as to
prize him, and live in obedience to him. A
<hi>nurse</hi> that hath a nurse-child, will cut the meat,
and will many times <hi>chew</hi> the meat for the
child, but she will not <hi>eat</hi> the meat, but give
it to the child; for if she should chew the
meat and eat it up her self, the child might
starve for all her chewing of it, and preparing
of it; so it is with the grace of meditation.
<hi>Meditation,</hi> while it is in the understanding,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65780:23"/>
               <hi>chews</hi> upon the things of God, and of Christ,
and of Heaven, but when the understanding
hath chewed these things, it must not devour
all these things it self, but it must convey the
meat it hath chewed (as the meat is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the stomack into the liver, and then
into the heart, and then into all the other
parts of the body) into the <hi>heart,</hi> and into
the will, and into the affections, and into the
conversation.</p>
            <p>This is the first, the admirable <hi>nature</hi> of this
grace.</p>
            <p>2. I come to shew you <hi>the necessity of it;</hi>
and I do this the rather, that I might provoke
you all to the <hi>practice</hi> of it; for I am very
confident there are few people that do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
this duty of meditation; there are <hi>few</hi>
that know how to practise it; but there are
very few that make conscience to practise it;
even you that make conscience <hi>to praying
twice a day</hi> in your family, seldom make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<hi>once a day</hi> of meditation, nay <hi>once a
week.</hi> And therefore that I might awaken my
self and you, give me leave to shew you the
<hi>great necessity</hi> of practising the duty of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and I will shew it <hi>two manner of
ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>By considering the</hi> mischief that flows
from the want of practising this duty.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By shewing you the</hi> advantage and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65780:24"/>
benefit that you will gain by practising this
duty.</p>
            <p>1. I shall shew you the <hi>woful inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the intolerable mischiefs</hi> that come
from the want of practising this duty of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.
I will bring them to <hi>two heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I will shew you, that the <hi>want of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this duty is the cause of all sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is the cause of all punishment.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>I will shew you, that</hi> the want of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this duty is the cause of all sin: and I will
instance in particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>reason why people harden their hearts
in sin,</hi> and do not repent of their sins, but
go on obstinately, is for want of meditation.
<hi>Ier. 8. 6. I hearkened and heard, but they spake
not aright, no man repented him of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
saying, what have I done?</hi> They did not
repent, because they did not reflect upon what
they did; they did not bethink themselves,
so the phrase is, <hi>If any man bethink himself and
repent,</hi> 1 King. 8. 47. they did not say, I am
undone by what I have done; I have lost God
and Heaven by what I have done; and if I
do not repent, I am an undone creature for
ever. No man repented of his wickedness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no man considered what he had done;
for did you consider the evil that is in sin, did
you dwell and abide upon it, did you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with your own hearts, and seriously
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65780:24"/>
consider what an evil and bitter thing it is to
sin against God, you durst not willingly sin
against God; but the reason why men go on
rashly, heedlesly, obstinately in sin, is for
<hi>want of the meditation of the evil of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The reason why <hi>all the Sermons we hear
do us no more good, is for want of Divine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;</hi>
for it is with Sermons as it is with
meat, it is not the having of meat upon your
table will feed you, but you must eat it; and
not only eat it, but concoct it, and digest it,
or else your meat will do you no good: So it
is with Sermons, it is not the hearing Sermons
will do you good, but it is the concocting
them, digesting them by meditation; the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
in your hearts what you hear, must do
you good. And <hi>one</hi> Sermon well digested, well
meditated upon, is better than <hi>twenty</hi> Sermons
without meditation. As for example, a little
meat well digested will nourish a man more
than a great deal of meat if it breed raw hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
if it doth not digest; it is the <hi>digesting</hi>
of meat nourisheth a man: Now <hi>meditation
is that that will digest all the Sermons</hi> you
<hi>hear.</hi> There are some men sick of a disease, that
whatsoever they eat comes up presently, the
meat never doth them any good; so it is the
custom of many of you, you hear a Sermon,
you go away, and never think of it afterward;
this is just like meat that you vomit up. There
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65780:25"/>
is a disease that some men have, that all the
meat they eat <hi>goes thorow them,</hi> it never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides
with them; now this meat never nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth:
so it is with the Sermons you hear,
I am sure on the week-day, and I am afraid
the Sermons you hear on the Sabbath-day go
<hi>thorow you,</hi> you hear them, and hear them, and
that is all you do; but you never seek by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
to root them in your hearts; and that
is the reason why you are so lean in grace,
though you are so full fed with Sermons; it
is with Sermons as it is with a Plaister, if a man
hath a wound in his body, and lay a <hi>plaister</hi>
to the wound, this <hi>plaister</hi> will never heal
him, unless it <hi>abide</hi> upon the wound; if a man
takes it away as soon as ever it is laid on, it
will never do him any good; so it is with
Sermons: if when you have heard a Sermon,
you never <hi>ponder and meditate</hi> on it, it is just
like a <hi>plaister put on, and then pulled off again;</hi>
and I am confident the great reason why we
have so many lean hunger-starved Christians,
that are lean in knowledg, and lean in grace,
though they hear Sermon upon Sermon, (it
may be on the Sabbath-day they will hear
four or five Sermons) is because they concoct
and <hi>digest nothing;</hi> they never ponder and
meditate upon what they hear; and this is
that that our Saviour Christ speaks of: by the
seed that was sown by the high-way-side, is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65780:25"/>
meant a man, that hears the word, and never
thinks of it after he hath heard it, but suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Devil to steal it out of his heart; as
the husbandman that sows the seed in the
high-way, you know he never plows it, he
never looks that that should come to any
thing. There are many of you, the Sermons
you hear are like the seed sown in the high-way,
you <hi>never cover</hi> it by meditation, you
never think of it, when you have heard it;
and that is the reason you get no more good
by what you hear.</p>
            <p>3. The reason why the <hi>promises of God do
no more affect your hearts, when the Saints
of God taste no more sweetness in the promises,</hi>
is because you do not ponder and meditate
upon them. It is with the Promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
as it is with a <hi>cordial,</hi> if a man doth not
chew his <hi>cordial</hi> but swallow it down whole,
he will never taste any great sweetness, in it;
the way to taste the sweetness is to chew it;
so the Promises of God are full of Heavenly
comfort, but you will never enjoy this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
unless you chew them by meditation. As
it is with <hi>spices, unless they be bruised,</hi> they
never smell sweet; and as it is with a <hi>Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
unless you do <hi>rub</hi> it, you will never smell
the sweetness of it; no more will you ever
taste the Heavenly comfort that is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospel, unless you rub them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65780:26"/>
you bruise, unless you chew them by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.
And the reason why the Saints of
God walk so uncomfortably all their lives
long, is because they do not chew these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The reason why the threatnings of God
make no more impression upon our hearts, is for
want of meditation.</hi> There are terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
against sin in the word, but alas there
are few people affected with these threatnings.
The threatnings of God in Scripture are <hi>like
the ratling of hail</hi> upon the tiles, they make a
great noise, but they make no impression; and
what is the reason? it is for want of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
we do not lay them to heart, we do
not consider that these threatnings belong to
us, as long as we continue in our sins. Oh did
a wicked man meditate solemnly upon the
threatnings of God, it would make his heart
ake, especially when the spirit of bondage
goes along with them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The reason why the mercies of God do no
more good upon us, is for want of meditation.</hi>
There are many mercies that all of us have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from God, many personal mercies, and
many family-mercies, and all these mercies are
so many motives to service. Now what is the
reason the Saints of God bury the mercies of
God in forgetfulness, and are no more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for mercies? the reason is for want of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65780:26"/>
               <hi>Isa. 1. 2, 3. Hear, oh heavens, and
give ear, oh earth, for the Lord hath spoken: I
have nourished and brought up children, and
they have rebelled against me; the ox knoweth
his owner, and the ass his masters crib, but Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
doth not know, my people doth not consider:</hi>
That is the reason why they are so unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
It is with the mercies of God as it is with
the <hi>fire,</hi> if a man walks by the fire and doth
not <hi>sit</hi> at it, it will never heat him much; if he
be a cold, he must abide at the fire, or else he
will never be hot; so it is not a slight thought
of the mercies of God that will affect your
hearts, but it must be a dwelling upon them
by meditation, that will warm your hearts.
Now because we do not meditate upon these
mercies, we do <hi>not solemnly consider</hi> the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, therefore it is they do no more
good upon our hearts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. there is a
<hi>Psalm</hi> spent on purpose to set out the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness
of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> Vers. 3.
<hi>We have sinned with our fathers, we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
iniquity, we have done wickedly; our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
understood not thy wonders in Egypt, they
remembred not the multitude of thy mercies, but
provoked him at the Sea, even at the Red-sea.</hi>
What is the reason they were so unthankful?
it was because they did not meditate on the
mercies of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65780:27"/>
6. <hi>The reason why afflictions do work no more
upon us, and why we are never the better for the
afflicting hand of God,</hi> is <hi>for want of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
It is a rare Text, <hi>Eccles. 7. 14. In the
day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
consider.</hi> Times of <hi>affliction</hi> are <hi>times of
meditation;</hi> and what must we consider of in
the day of adversity? we must consider <hi>who</hi> it
is that afflicts us, and <hi>why</hi> we are afflicted, and
<hi>how</hi> we shall do to have our afflictions sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
we must consider the meaning of Gods
rod, and how we may be taught by these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
spiritual things. Now because we do
not meditate upon God, and upon his afflicting
hand when we are afflicted, because we have
slight heads under our afflictions, therefore it
is we get no more good by our afflictions. I
have observed many of us (the Lord pardon
it unto us) as soon as ever we are recovered
from our afflictions, <hi>we forget God</hi> presently,
we <hi>never consider</hi> the mercies of God in reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
us, and then we return to our old vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
again, for want of meditation.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>The reason why the Providences of God
take no more impression upon our hearts, is for
want of this grace of meditation:</hi> The Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of God are very mysterious, and God
in the Government of the World doth walk in
the Clouds. And truly I am very confident, that
which God doth especially require of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65780:27"/>
in these days, is to meditate upon his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences,</hi>
as well as upon his <hi>Ordinances;</hi> there
are many rare lessons to be learned from the
consideration of the Providences of God, the
Providence of God toward <hi>England,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and toward the <hi>Ministry;</hi> God
is now depriving you of Minister upon Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
many Ministers the Lord hath taken from
you; God is, as I may so speak, disburthening
the Nation of this great burden of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
which is a burden to a great many; God
takes his Ministers up to Heaven. Now what
is the reason that the Providences of God of
late years do no more good, though they
have been wonderful toward <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> towards all sorts of people?
The reason why we are never the better by
them, is because we do not study the meaning
of all these Providences, <hi>Isa. 57. 1. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart,
and merciful men are taken away, none consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the righteous is taken away from the evil
to come.</hi> This is the reason why we get no
more good by the death of the godly, and by
the Providences of God, because we do not
lay them to heart; we do not muse and study
upon them.</p>
            <p>8. What is <hi>the reason that the Saints of God
are so distrustful of Gods Providences?</hi> when
they are ready presently to sink, and to say
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65780:28"/>
they are undone? It is for want of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. saith, <hi>Take
no thought what you shall eat, or what you shall
put on; consider the ravens, for they neither sow
nor reap, which neither have store-house nor barn,
and God feedeth them; how much more are ye
better than the fowls? Consider the lillies how
they grow, they toil not, they spin not; and yet
I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these.</hi> Did you consider
the <hi>lillies,</hi> and the <hi>ravens,</hi> did you study the
love of God to you, you would not distrust
him under any sad Providences. <hi>The reason why
the Saints of God are so full of unbelief,</hi> when
they are in a low condition, is for <hi>want of
meditation;</hi> they do <hi>not consider the ravens,</hi>
and the <hi>lillies,</hi> they do not study the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that God hath made to his children in their
lowest condition.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>The reason why the professors of Religion
are so censorious of other men, and so little cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious
of themselves, why they judg every man,
and examine every man but themselves,</hi> (which
is the condition of these days) it is for want
of meditation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. Iudg not that ye be not
judged: for with what judgment ye judg, ye shall
be judged: and with what measure you mete, it
shall be measured to you again. And why behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but
considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye?
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65780:28"/>
If men did reflect more upon themselves, they
would censure themselves more, and others
less. And the reason why people are so rash in
censuring, is for want of self-reflection.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>The reason why professors of Religion do
offer the sacrifices of fools to God, when they
come to worship him;</hi> why they pray headily
and rashly, why they rush upon Ordinances
without preparation, is for want of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Eccles. 5. 1. Keep thy foot when thou goest
to the house of God, and be more ready to hear
than to offer the sacrifices of fools, for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not that they do evil. Be not rash with thy
mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter
any thing before God.</hi> Why do people rush up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sacraments without preparation, rush up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sermons, rush upon Prayer, rush upon
holy Duties? why, they do not consider what
they do.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>What is the reason that people prepare no
more for death? Because they do not consider the
shortness of life.</hi> They do not meditate of the
vanity of this life, of the certainty and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of death; and therefore it is said,
<hi>Deut. 32. 29. Oh that they were wise, that they
understood this, that they would consider their
latter end!</hi> Because men do not consider their
latter end, therefore it is that they are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
for their latter end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65780:29"/>
12. And lastly, <hi>What is the reason that we
come so unworthily to the Sacrament?</hi> and when
we are there, we gaze up and down, and carry
our selves so unseemly at that Ordinance?
what is the reason that we lose all the fruit of
that Ordinance, but meerly for want of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
before we come, and meditation
when we are come? now preparation cannot
be without meditation; preparation includes
meditation in it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The want of the practise of this duty is
the cause of all punishment:</hi> Isa. 12. 11. <hi>The
whole land is laid desolate, because no man lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it to heart.</hi> Oh this is the cause of the
sword that hath drunk so much blood in this
Nation, no man lays to heart the Judgments
of the Lord, therefore the land is become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate.
<hi>Psal. 28. 5. Because they regard not the
works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hand,
he shall destroy them, and not build them up;</hi>
because they do not meditate of Gods works,
therefore they Lord will destroy them. Nay,
let me add that that is above all this, for God
to give a man over to a slight spirit, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditating
spirit, to a rashness and slightness
of spirit, is one of the greatest Judgments in
the world. <hi>A man of a slight head can never
have a good heart;</hi> a slight hearted Christian
can never be a good Christian; he that thinks
slightly of God, will speak slightly of God;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65780:29"/>
and he that speaks slightly of God, will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God slightly; and he that slights God, God
will slight him; now there cannot be a more
cursed frame of spirit, than to be given over
to an unconsiderate frame of spirit; an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
Christian is an inconsiderable
Christian. <hi>Isa. 42. 24, 25. Who gave Iacob for
a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the
Lord, he, against whom we have sinned? for
they would not walk in his ways, neither were
they obedient to his law. Therefore he hath pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon him the fury of his anger, and the
strength of battel, and it hath set him on fire
round about, yet he knew not; and it burned
him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi> Here is the
curse of curses, not so much to be burnt, as
not to know it; not so much to have the
wrath of God upon us, as not to lay it to
heart; it is a sign of the greatest fury of God,
for a man to be given over to slightness of
spirit; when he is under the judgments of
God <hi>not to regard</hi> and lay them to heart.</p>
            <p>And thus I have been somewhat long in
setting out unto you the <hi>mischiefs</hi> that flow
from the want of the practise of the grace of
Meditation; and I do this to provoke you all
to be humbled before God for the not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this duty, (for I am confident your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
will tell you that you do not practise
it) and to convince you of the <hi>necessity</hi> of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65780:30"/>
practising of this duty, which is quite dead
and buried in the world. That I may be Gods
instrument to stir you up to a conscientious
practise of this duty of Heavenly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
            <p>2. I shall shew you the <hi>necessity of it from
the benefits and advantages that will come unto
Christians by the conscientious practise of this
duty;</hi> and this I will shew in <hi>three</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1. It is a mighty help to the working and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of all grace.</p>
            <p>2. It is a mighty help to preserve and increase
grace.</p>
            <p>3. It is a mighty help to arm us against the
Devil and all his temptations.</p>
            <p>1. Meditation when it is sanctified, is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
help to the begetting of all grace; <hi>this I will
shew in divers Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is a mighty <hi>help to work in us repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and reformation of life;</hi> and therefore
<hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 119. 59. I thought on my
ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. I
thought on my ways;</hi> that is, I considered the
evil of my ways, and what a bitter thing it
is to sin against God, what a dishonour I have
brought upon God by my evil ways, and what
a scandal I have brought upon Religion. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
36. 31. <hi>Then shall you remember your own evil
ways, and your doings that were not good, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65780:30"/>
shall loath your selves in your own sight for your
iniquities, and for your abominations.</hi> A consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
meditation of the evil of sin, is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hammer to break your hearts for sin, and
from sin; for did you <hi>consider</hi> the Majesty of
God that is offended by the least sin; did you
consider the infinite wrath of God against
sin; did you consider the affronts that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to God by sin; that every sin is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning
of God, a robbing of God, a stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
through the name of God; did you <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
the pollution that is in sin, that sin makes
you like the Devil; did you further consider
the mischief that sin brings upon us; sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
you of the Beatifical vision; sin shuts
you out of heaven; sin binds you over to
everlasting burnings.</p>
            <p>Again, did you <hi>consider the patience of God,</hi>
and the goodness of God towards you yet,
notwithstanding all your sins, and what an
unkind thing it is to sin against so good a God;
and did you further consider what Christ
hath done to purchase pardon for your sins,
and how Christ hath shed his blood for such
wicked wretches as you are; did you sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiedly
<hi>meditate</hi> upon these things, it would
mightily provoke you <hi>to repent</hi> of your sins,
and to turn unto God. And therefore you
shall read concerning <hi>Peter,</hi> after he had deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ, <hi>Mark 14. 72. The cock crew, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65780:31"/>
Peter called to mind the word Iesus said unto
him, Before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny
me thrice; and when he thought thereon he wept.</hi>
The meaning of the <hi>Greek</hi> word is, When he
weighed the speech of Christ, when he thought
what an unkind thing it was to deny his dear
Lord and Master, this made him weep; if he
had not meditated of the evil that he had
committed, he had never wept. And what
made the Prodigal child return home to his
father? you shall see the reason, <hi>Luk. 15. 17.
And when he came to himself, he said, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hired servants of my father have bread enough,
and to spare, and I perish with hunger!</hi> When
he came to <hi>consider</hi> with himself, the misery
that he had brought upon himself, and that
there were many servants in his fathers house
that had bread enough, <hi>I will arise</hi> (saith he)
<hi>and go to my father, and I will say, Father, I
have sinned against heaven,</hi> (all this was but
his meditation, he did but thus think in his
heart to do this) <hi>and he arose and came to his
Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Divine meditation is a mighty help to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in us a love to God;</hi> for as it is with a <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi>
that hath a <hi>curtain</hi> drawn over it, though
the picture be never so beautiful, you <hi>cannot
see the beauty of it</hi> till the curtain be drawn
aside; to an unconsiderating, an unmedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Christian, God is as a picture with a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65780:31"/>
drawn over it, he cannot see the beauty
of God, but <hi>meditation draws the curtain,</hi> and
lets us in to behold all the beauty that is in
God; and he that beholds the beauty of God,
cannot but love God. As it is said of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
he was so good a man that all that knew him
loved him; and if any man did not love him,
it was because they did not know him; much
more may I say of God, All that <hi>meditate</hi> in,
and study God, cannot but love him. And
the reason why you do not love him, is because
you do not study and meditate on God: as it
is said, 1 <hi>Ioh. 4. 8. He that loveth not, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not God, for God is love: he that knoweth
God, loveth God.</hi> What is the reason the Saints
in heaven love God so perfectly? because they
always behold his face, they see him, they
think on him. And did you <hi>meditate</hi> upon the
excellency of God, that God is altogether
lovely, that all Excellencies are after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
manner concentered in God, that there
is nothing lovely in the Creature but it is to
be found infinitely in the Creator: Did you
further <hi>consider</hi> all the good things that God
hath done for you; all the blessings and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that you have received from God; did you
not only think, but did you dwell upon these
thoughts, did you sit at this fire, it would
kindle a mighty flame of Divine love in your
souls; therefore <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 39. 3. My
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65780:32"/>
heart was hot within me; while I was musing the
fire burned.</hi> Psal. 104. 34. <hi>My meditation of
him shall be sweet.</hi> Did you meditate much of
God, you would taste a sweetness in God, that
would be as a Loadstone to draw your hearts
to the love of God.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Divine meditation is a mighty help to work
in us a fear of God, the fear of God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of wisdom;</hi> now did you study the
Majesty of God, that God hath all men, all
the Devils in a chain, and that God only can
do us hurt; and that no man can do us hurt
but God must give him leave. Did you study
the <hi>Omnipotency</hi> of God, you would fear God,
and fear him only: as it is <hi>Isa. 51. 12, 13. I,
even I am he that comforteth you: who art thou
that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall
die, and the son of man that shall be made as
grass, and forgettest the Lord thy maker, that
hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the
foundations of the earth!</hi> As if he should say,
If thou didst remember and think on the Lord
thy God, who made the Heavens and the
Earth, and hath all things in his hand, <hi>Thou
wouldest not fear a man that shall die, &amp;c.</hi> Jer.
10. 6, 7. first the Prophet breaks out into an
admiration of God, <hi>Forasmuch as there is none
like unto thee, O Lord: thou art great, and thy
name is great in might: who would not fear thee,
O King of Nations? for to thee doth it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65780:32"/>
forasmuch as among all the wise men of the
Nations, and in all their Kingdoms, there is
none like unto thee.</hi> The meditation of God
stirs up the Prophet to fear God, <hi>Ier. 5. 22.
Fear ye not me, saith the Lord? will you not
tremble at my presence, which hath placed the
sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
that it cannot pass, though the waves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
toss themselves, yet can they not prevail: though
they roar, yet cannot they pass over it.</hi> Did we
<hi>meditate</hi> much upon the power of God, we
would fear him, and stand in awe of him.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>This Divine meditation is a mighty help
to beget in us a love to Iesus Christ;</hi> for Jesus
Christ is a fountain sealed, a spring shut up,
a garden inclosed. Now you know no man is
the better for a book sealed up, or a treasure
lockt up; to a careless Christian Christ is a
fountain sealed, a treasure lockt up; but <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi>
is the key that unlocks the treasury
of all the Excellencies of Christ, and opens
the book to let us read all the Excellencies
that are in Christ. Meditation doth as it were
open the fountain; and did we study what
Christ is, that he is the choicest of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
altogether excellent, the brightness of
his Fathers glory, and the express image of
his Person; and did we study the love of
Christ to poor sinners, the height, the depth,
the length, the breadth of the love of God
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65780:33"/>
toward us; did we study how Christ became
poor to make us rich, how he became a curse
to free us from the curse; how he was made
sin that we might be made the righteousness
of God thorough him; did we bury our selves
in this meditation; did you take half an hour
in a day to meditate on the Excellency of
Christ, did you when you walk in the fields
<hi>meditate</hi> on the love of Christ, I am confident
it would beget in you a love to Christ.</p>
            <p>5. Divine meditation is a mighty help to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
us to believe and trust in God. <hi>To trust,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. In his Providence in all outward streights.</p>
            <p>2. In his Promises in all spiritual troubles.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It will help you to trust in his Providence
when you are in any streights: when all creature-helps
fail,</hi> and you are ready to sink, then me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
will raise your faith, and help you
to trust in Gods Providence for outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
<hi>Mat. 6. 25, &amp;c. I say unto you</hi> (saith
Christ) <hi>take no thought for your life what you
shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for
your body what you shall put on;</hi> be not solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for your outward provision. But how
doth Christ argue? what way should we take,
that we may not distrust God? saith he, <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon the fowls of the air; behold the fowls
of the air for they sow not.</hi> v. 28. <hi>Why take you
thought for raiment, consider the lillies of the
field how they grow, they toil not, neither do
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65780:33"/>
they spin, and yet I say unto you, that even Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these.</hi> The meditation of the lillies and the
fowls of the air is a means to help us to trust
in the Lord in the day of our streights.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It will enable you to relye upon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
for the good of your souls.</hi> Did you when
you read the <hi>promises</hi> of the Bible, chew them,
how sweet would they be; the reason why
the Promises are not sweet to you, is because
you read them, but you do <hi>not chew them by
meditating upon them;</hi> if you did meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they would be sweeter than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the honey-comb, especially if you
did join application with meditation. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was the Father of the Faithful, and he
was strong in faith; and what made him strong
in faith? because he <hi>considered not</hi> his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
now dead, neither the deadness of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s
womb, but he considered the promise of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19. And the reason why the Saints
of God are so void of comfort, and hang
down their heads, and walk so disconsolately,
is because they consider the deadness of their
own souls; they consider their imperfections,
but they do <hi>not meditate upon the promises,</hi> the
freeness and the riches of them, <hi>Mat. 16. 8.
Which when Iesus perceived, he said to them, Oh
ye of little faith, why reason ye among your selves,
because you have brought no bread?</hi> Here Christ
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65780:34"/>
reproves them for want of faith; but how
came they to want faith? <hi>Do you not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
neither remember the five loaves of the
five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
and do ye not remember the seven loaves of the
four thousand, and how many baskets you took
up?</hi> As if Christ should have said, If you had
<hi>meditated</hi> on my former miracles, you would
never have doubted this miracle; but because
you <hi>do not remember</hi> what I have formerly
done, therefore it is that you are so full of
unbelief. Now the way to fill your souls with
comfort is to meditate upon the Promises of
God.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Divine meditation is a mighty help to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in us a contempt of the world, and all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things;</hi> for the world is like unto gilded
copper, it is an easie matter for a man to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
gilded copper for true gold, unless he
considers what he takes; for if a man take
<hi>gold without consideration,</hi> he may quickly be
cozened; there is a glittering excellency in the
world, the wealth and riches of it are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things to a carnal eye, but meditation of
the world will wash away all the paint that is
upon the world; the <hi>studying</hi> the vanity of
the world, the nothingness of all earthly
things, the unsatisfiableness of them, and the
perishing nature of them, this will take away
the glittering excellency that seems to be in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65780:34"/>
the world; and certainly you would never be
so covetous, and so worldly, and dote so much
upon the world, did you <hi>meditate</hi> upon the
vanity of it, as you should do; this is the
course <hi>Solomon</hi> takes: the book of <hi>Eccles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>The Book of the Preacher;</hi> and the <hi>subject</hi>
of it is to wean us from the love of the world.
But what course doth <hi>Solomon</hi> take? <hi>Eccles.
1. 3. I gave my heart to seek and search out by
wisdom concerning all things done under heaven.</hi>
His course was to consider all the Creatures
that were under the Heaven; <hi>I have seen,</hi> saith
he, <hi>all the works that are done under the Sun,
and behold all is but vanity and vexation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
After he had meditated upon the world,
he goes over the riches and the pleasures of
the world, and when he had reckoned them
all, he concludes in <hi>Chap. 2. 11. Then I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on all the works my hand had wrought, and
on the labour that I had laboured to do, and
behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit. I
gathered me silver and gold, and the peculiar
treasure of Kings, and of the Provinces; I got
me men-singers, and women-singers, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of the sons of men, as musical instruments,
and that of all sorts; so I was great, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
more than all before me in Ierusalem; also
my wisdom remained with me, and whatsoever
mine eyes desired I kept not from them.</hi> And
when he had looked upon all these glorious
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65780:35"/>
Excellencies, what was his Conclusion? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi>
saith he, <hi>all was vanity and vexation of
spirit, and there was no profit under the Sun.</hi>
Did we meditate much on the vanity of the
world, we would not idolize it so much.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Divine Meditation is a mighty help to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in us the grace of thankefulness for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and blessings we receive from God.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is a great duty that lyes upon us to be
thankful for Gods mercies; now there is no
way to stir you up to <hi>thankefulness</hi> so much as
meditation upon the mercies of God; for he
that forgets the mercies of God, cannot be
thankful for them; and therefore mark the
course that <hi>David</hi> takes, <hi>Psal. 8. 3. When I
consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the
Moon, the Stars, which thou hast ordained;</hi>
then he crys out, <hi>What is man that thou art
mindful of him! or the son of man that thou vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitest
him! for thou hast made him a little lower
than the angels.</hi> When he considered what God
had done for <hi>man,</hi> then he admires the love
of God to man, and breaks out into <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</hi>
Certainly a Christian forgetful of
Gods mercies can never be thankful for them;
and the way to beget <hi>thankefulness</hi> is to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
on what God hath done for us.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Divine Meditation is a mighty help to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in you a preferring of Gods house before your
own house.</hi> It is the great sin of this age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65780:35"/>
we live, that every man studies to build his
own house, and no man cares for the house of
the Lord: We may truly say as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith,
<hi>This is Sion whom no man regards;</hi> every man
seeks his own interest, and no man almost cares
what becomes of Religion. There is a strange
kind of lukewarmness that is upon the spirits
of all men in this age, that so men may grow
great themselves, they care not what becomes
of the House of God: Now <hi>Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
would make you prefer the building of
<hi>Gods House</hi> before the building of your <hi>own
house.</hi> And for this purpose let me beseech you
to read <hi>Hag. 1. 4. Is it time for you, Oh ye, to
dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lye
waste?</hi> It was the sin of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi>
that they neglected the building of Gods
House, and every man strove to grow rich in
his own particular: <hi>Now therefore thus saith
the Lord of hosts, consider your ways,</hi> (here the
Prophet calleth them to consideration) <hi>ye have
sown much, but bring in little; ye eat, but you
have not enough; ye drink but ye are not filled
with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm.
And he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put
it into a bag with holes.</hi> What was the matter?
because they did not build Gods House, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God did not build their house: <hi>v. 7. Thus
saith the Lord of Hosts, consider your ways: ye
looked for much, but lo it came to little: and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65780:36"/>
when you brought it home, I did blow upon it;
why saith the Lord of Hosts, because of my house
that is waste, and ye run every man into his own
house, therefore the heaven over you is stayed
from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.</hi>
God will never settle <hi>England,</hi> God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
settle your houses, till you make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to build <hi>Gods House,</hi> and till you have
more zeal for the House of God than for
your own houses; though you may dream of
peace and plenty, yet certainly the Lord will
never build your houses, until you build Gods
House. And therefore he saith further, <hi>Hag.
2. 17. I smote you with blasting and with mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew,
and with hail in all the labours of your
hands, yet ye turned not to me, saith the Lord.
Consider now from this day and upward, from
the four and twentieth day of the ninth month,
even from the day that the foundation of the
Lords Temple was laid; consider it, from this
day will I bless you.</hi> And certainly the world
is much mistaken; the way to build your own
house, is to join together to settle Religion;
God will never prosper you, till Gods House
be setled. And did you meditate on these two
Chapters, the first and second Chapter of
<hi>Haggai,</hi> it would by Gods grace beget in you
a mighty zeal toward the setling of the House
of God, and to prefer that before the setling
of your own house.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:65780:36"/>
9. Divine Meditation will beget in us a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all the commandments of God. <hi>There is
no Commandment of God but Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
when it is sanctified, (I do not say
otherwise) will work in us, and inable us to
keep:</hi> Deut. 4. 39, 40. Know therefore this
day, and consider it in thy heart, that the Lord
is God in heaven above, and upon the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
there is none else; thou shalt keep there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his statutes, and his commandments. <hi>And</hi>
David <hi>saith,</hi> Psal. 119. 55. I have remembred
thy name, Oh Lord, in the night, and have kept
thy Law.</p>
            <p>2. Divine <hi>Meditation</hi> is not only <hi>a means
to beget grace, but it is a mighty help to preserve
and increase grace.</hi> As the wood preserves the
fire; as the oil preserves the flame; as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preserves the fish, so doth meditation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
your graces. It preserves every grace,
and it increaseth every grace; for Meditation
is a Divine pair of bellows to blow up the
sparks of grace; when there is but a little fire,
meditation will kindle this fire more, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it; when you find your love of God
grows cold, meditate upon the love of God,
and this will kindle the love of God in your
hearts; and when you find the fear of God
to diminish in you, meditate upon the power
of God, that thy breath is in his hand, that
he hath thee in his hand; this will increase
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65780:37"/>
the fear of God; and so when the love of the
world increaseth upon you, meditate upon
the vanity and nothingness of it, and this will
decrease the love of the world.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Divine Meditation,</hi> as it is a means to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
grace, and to increase grace, so it is a
mighty means to arm and defend us against all
the temptations of the Devil, and against all
his fiery darts. It is armour of proof against
the Devil and all his temptations. What made
<hi>Moses</hi> refuse the pleasure, treasures and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of <hi>Egypt?</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi> when he was of
age, a young man, and fit to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he chose rather to suffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin; he
refused to be called the Son of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s
Daughter: What made him do all this? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had respect to the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and he beheld him that was invisible;
he meditated upon the reward he should have
in Heaven; he knew the pleasures of Heaven
were better than the pleasures of <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s
Court; and he knew the treasures he should
have in Heaven were better than the treasures
he should have in <hi>Egyyt;</hi> and therefore he
chose rather to suffer affliction with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season: He knew he could not enjoy
<hi>both,</hi> and he had an eye to the recompence of
reward, he saw him that was invisible; and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65780:37"/>
this made him do all this; he could never have
done this without this Divine grace of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
And what made <hi>Ioseph</hi> refuse to lye
with his Mistris, when he might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by lying with her, and had secresie
and security? why he meditated, <hi>How can I
do this and sin against God?</hi> He thought of
God, and he would not do it; it was medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that made him refuse it. What made
the Saints of old receive joyfully the spoiling
of their goods? <hi>Heb. 10. 34. They took joyfully
the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves
that they had in heaven a better and an enduring
substance.</hi> Because <hi>they knew,</hi> that is, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
that they had in Heaven an enduring
substance, an eternal reward, they should
have better riches there; they considered that,
and that made them lose their outward estates;
they looked for a better estate in Heaven. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Hooper,</hi> when he was going to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
over night he discoursed and reasoned
with himself; saith he, <hi>When I think of the fire,
I begin to be afraid, for I fear that fire will burn:
but when I think of the fire of hell, the fear of
eternal fire makes me willing to endure a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
fire.</hi> Saith he again, <hi>When I think of the
loss of life, I begin to be afraid; I know life is
precious; and when I meditate upon these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enjoyments, outward preferments, I seem
unwilling to be burnt; but when I meditate of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65780:38"/>
the joys of Heaven, and the preferments that I
shall have there, this makes me willing to go
through fire, to go through Martyrdom to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
It was <hi>meditation</hi> of Heaven, and the joys
of Heaven that made the <hi>Martyrs</hi> come so
willingly to the stake, and imbrace it as a
bride doth her bridegroom.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewed you the great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of this grace of Meditation: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
now that I should come to the <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of this <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this duty of <hi>Divine Meditation</hi> be so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
a duty, as you have heard; then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
those Christians that are utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed,
and unacquainted with this duty;
that receive mercies from God, but are never
the better for the mercies they do receive,
for want of meditation, <hi>That do not say in
their hearts, let us fear that God that doth give
us the former and the latter rain,</hi> as it is, <hi>Ier. 5.
23.</hi> it reproves those that are guilty of many
sins, but do not repent for want of <hi>considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
because they do not say in their hearts
what have I done? it reproves those that meet
with many losses and crosses in the world, but
are never the better, for their afflictions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do not consider what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Gods rod, and how they may get their
afflictions sanctified; that read the blessed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospel, but taste not the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65780:38"/>
of them for want of meditation, for want
of chewing them; in a word, that hear many
Sermons, but are never the better for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
they hear, and all for want of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Meditation.</p>
            <p>The mercies of God, and the promises of
God, and the afflictions of God, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
we hear, are like unto a <hi>Soveraign plaister,</hi>
which though it be never so good, if it be taken
off the wound as soon as ever it is laid on, it
will never cure the wound, it is the abiding of
the Plaister upon the wound that cures it: So
it is the dwelling upon the mercies we receive,
the chewing upon the Promises, the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon the Sermons we hear, will do us
good. That man that hears a Sermon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
it as soon as he hath heard it, will get no
good by it; it is with Sermons and mercies as
it is with meat, a man may eat his meat and be
never the more nourished if he do not digest
it, if he vomit it up as soon as he hath eaten
it, or if his meat presently go through him, it
will do him no good; it is the digesting, the
concocting of meat that nourisheth a man; so
there are thousands of people that hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
upon Sermon, and yet are never the more
holy by what they hear, for want of digesting
the Sermons they hear by <hi>Divine Meditation:</hi>
Now this <hi>want of meditation</hi> is a sin, that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self most Christians are guilty of, I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65780:39"/>
cannot exclude my self; there are few Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that are convinced of the necessity of this
duty of <hi>Divine Meditation,</hi> few that practise
this duty; the great God hath exercised this
Nation with variety of Providences for these
many years; we have been these eleven or
twelve years in the fire of affliction; we have
met with unexpected changes and alterations,
but where is the man that lays to heart the
Providences of God? where is the man that
<hi>studies</hi> what God is doing with this Nation?
and how to get the Providences of God san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified?
We may say of most of the Nation, as
it is in <hi>Ier. 12. 11. The whole land is made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,
because no man layeth it to heart.</hi> There
is no man considers what is the meaning of
Gods Providences, the variety and strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and wonderfulness of them. We are like
unto those, <hi>Isa. 42. 24, 25. Who gave Israel to
the spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the
Lord, he against whom we have sinned? for they
would not walk in his ways, neither were they
obedient to his law, therefore he hath poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the fury of his anger, and the strength of
battel, and it hath set him on fire round about,
yet he knew not; and it burned him, but he laid
it not to heart.</hi> We have been burning, and
burning, and consuming, but no man lays it
to heart; this is the great sin of this Nation,
the Lord humble us. There are <hi>four sorts</hi> of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65780:39"/>
Christians that are here to be reproved for
the want of the grace of <hi>Divine Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>ignorant Christian,</hi> that knows not
how to set about the work of Meditation for
want of matter to meditate upon; for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
supposeth knowledg, meditation is a
dwelling upon that we know; and therefore
the ignorant Christian cannot be a meditating
Christian; he that is ignorant of God, cannot
meditate of God; he that is ignorant of
Christ crucified, cannot meditate of Christ
crucified; and this is one reason why so many
Saints of God are so barren in Sacramental
meditation, because they know so little of
Christ crucified; the ignorance of God and
Christ is not only a sin, but it is the root of
all sin. It is said, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12. of the two
Sons of old <hi>Eli, They were sons of Belial, and
they knew not the Lord.</hi> All sin is wrapt up in
<hi>ignorance,</hi> as a child in swadling clouts; as
Toads and Serpents grow in dirty and dark
Cellars, so doth all sin grow where <hi>ignorance</hi>
dwells. And therefore <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, That
ignorance is a deep hell. And one saith very
well, An ignorant Christian is the Devils
shop, wherein he forges all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>2. There is the <hi>forgetful Christian:</hi> for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
is a meditating of what we know
concerning God and Heaven, and the day of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65780:40"/>
Judgment; it is a bringing of the things we
know, unto our selves; and therefore a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
Christian cannot be a meditating Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
he that forgets the Mercies of God, can
never meditate on the Mercies of God: This
sin of <hi>forgetfulness</hi> of God, is a sin that the
Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were very guilty of, <hi>Psal.</hi>
106. 7. The Prophet complains of them;
our Fathers understood not thy wonders in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> they <hi>remembred not</hi> the multitude of thy
mercies, but provoked him at the Sea, even
at the red Sea, <hi>v.</hi> 13. they soon <hi>forgot</hi> his
works, <hi>v. 31. They forgot God their Saviour,
which had done great things in Egypt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he said, that he would destroy them.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness
of God, and the mercies of God,
is made the root of all sin, as well as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of God. <hi>Iudg. 3. 7. The children of
Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
the Lord their God, therefore they did evil
in the sight of the Lord.</hi> And therefore God
lays a charge upon the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that
when they came into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
should have the fulness of all outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
<hi>Deut. 8. 11. Beware</hi> (saith he) <hi>that thou
forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his
commandments, and his judgments, and his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
which I command thee this day: lest when
thou hast eaten, and art full, and hast built good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
houses, and dwelt therein:</hi> v. 14. <hi>Then thy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65780:40"/>
heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy
God.</hi> You that forget the mercies of God, God
will forget to be merciful unto you; and you
that do not remember what good things God
hath done for you, God will take order that
you shall have no good things to remember.
The good Thief on the Cross when he was
dying, his great request to Christ was, <hi>Lord
remember me when thou comest into thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
It is the great desire of all Saints that
God would remember them in mercy; but
certainly you that forget the mercies of God,
God will forget to be merciful unto you.</p>
            <p>3. I am to reprove the <hi>rash-headed Christian,</hi>
that rushes upon Duties, and upon Ordinances,
and publick Offices, without consideration; that
comes rashly to the Sacrament, and kneels
down rashly to his private and publick devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that doth not consider before-hand
when he comes to worship the Lord our God;
this I call the <hi>rash-headed</hi> Christian, we have
many such among us.</p>
            <p>And there are <hi>four</hi> things worthy your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
that may be said of a <hi>rash-headed</hi>
Christian.</p>
            <p>He is a <hi>spiritual fool,</hi> and all the Sacraments
he receives, and the prayers he makes, they are
the sacrifices of fools, as you have it excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down, <hi>Eccles. 5. 1, 2. Keep thy foot when
thou goest to the house of God, and be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65780:41"/>
to hear than to give the sacrifices of fools, for
they consider not that they do evil. Be not rash
with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to
utter any thing before God, for God is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words
be few. <hi>Out of which two verses I gather these
two things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That it is the duty of all Christians in
all their addresses to God to consider who this
God is to whom they draw near; to consider
their own vileness, and Gods excellency; to
consider that God is in heaven and they are
upon earth.</p>
            <p>2. That whosoever doth rush upon Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
without consideration, he doth offer
up the sacrifice of fools, because he doth not
consider that he doth evil; when you come
rashly to publick duties here upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,
and you come rashly to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and when you are hasty to utter words
to God, you come as so many spiritual
fools.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>rash-headed Christian</hi> will many times
speak that which he will wish he had not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and he will do that which he shall have
cause to repent of. We have many examples
of the Saints of God, that have paid dearly
for their <hi>rash-speaking,</hi> and their <hi>rash-practising;</hi>
for this rashness is a sin that the Saints of God
are very much subject to; we read of <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65780:41"/>
that he fell three times into this sin. <hi>Mat. 16.
22.</hi> there Christ told <hi>Peter, That he must be
crucified, and Peter began to rebuke him, saying,
Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto
thee. Peter</hi> spake very rashly; now Christ said
unto him, <hi>Get thee behind me, satan, thou art
an offence unto me.</hi> And <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. when Christ
was transfigured, then <hi>Peter</hi> began to utter a
rash speech; saith <hi>Peter</hi> to Christ, <hi>Master, it is
good for us to be here; and let us make three ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
one for thee, and one for Moses, and
one for Elias; not knowing what he said:</hi> It
was a rash speech; and especially, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.
when Christ told him that one of you shall
betray me; saith he very rashly, <hi>Master, though
all betray thee, yet will not I betray thee.</hi> But he
spake rashly, not knowing the deceitfulness of
his own heart. We read of the two brethren,
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they spake very rashly
unto Christ, <hi>Luk. 9. 54. When his two disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Iames and Iohn saw this, they said, Lord,
wilt thou that we command fire to come down
from heaven and consume them, even as Elias
did? but he turned and rebuked them, and said,
Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</hi>
We read of <hi>Moses,</hi> that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips, and God was angry with him,
<hi>Numb. 20. Shall we bring water for you out of
he rock? he spake unadvisedly, and the Lord
was angry with him. Iephtha</hi> made a rash vow,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65780:42"/>
               <hi>Whatsoever I see, I will offer in sacrifice.</hi> He had
cause to repent of that Vow. And that which
I say of <hi>words,</hi> I may say of <hi>deeds,</hi> the Saints
of God have done many things in their haste,
that they have cause to repent of; <hi>David</hi>
rashly gave away the land of innocent <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth</hi>
to his servant, 2 <hi>Sam. 16. 4. Ziba</hi>
came with a false accusation against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and <hi>David</hi> rashly without examining the
cause, said, <hi>Thine are all that pertained unto
Mephibosheth:</hi> which was a very sinful and an
unjust rash action of <hi>David;</hi> he gave away all
the estate of the Master to a cunning servant.
And when he came marching against <hi>Nabal,</hi>
he spake rashly, and was acting rashly; <hi>As
the Lord lives,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will not leave one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
of the house of Nabal:</hi> and he came with
his army thinking to destroy all, if <hi>Abigail</hi> had
not prevented him.</p>
            <p>3. A <hi>rash-headed Christian</hi> will quickly run
into error, and into by-paths. As a man that
runs hastily is very prone to stumble, so those
Christians that rush upon the profession of
Religion, and rush upon publick Offices and
Ordinances, they are like to miscarry in them,
and they are apt to run into error: for a rash-headed
Christian is led more by passion than
judgment; he is led more by affection than
by reason. He is like a horse without bridle,
like a house without walls, a city without
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65780:42"/>
gates; a city without walls and doors is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
robbed: so a <hi>rash-headed Christian</hi> is easily
cozened of the truths of Christ.</p>
            <p>4. A <hi>rash-headed Christian</hi> will never perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and hold out to the end; he that takes
a profession of Religion upon him rashly, and
doth not consider before-hand what it will
cost him, when this man meeteth with more
difficulty than he is aware of, he will aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
and fall away. And therefore it is the
speech of our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 14. 28. Which of
you intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
first, and counteth the cost whether he hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to finish it? What King going to make
war against another King, sitteth not down first
and counteth whether he be able with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
to meet him that cometh against him with
twenty thousand.</hi> Let it not be offensive to tell
you, and let not your hearts rise against it,
There are many of this City took up the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi>
Perswasion, but they never consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what they took, they took it as an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cried up, but as soon as ever they found
opposition they fell from it, because they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
considered what it was when they took it.
Few men consider seriously what Religion is,
and what it is to be a real Saint, and a real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of Religion; and therefore as soon as
ever persecution and trouble arise, they fall
away for want of meditation and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:65780:43"/>
4. I am to reprove especially your <hi>slight-headed
Christians,</hi> that cannot dwell long upon
any thing that is good, that rove and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from one thing to another; this frame
of spirit, if I be not mistaken, is quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to Religion. Do not think me censorious,
for I must profess, I have been long of this
opinion, That a <hi>slight-headed Christian cannot
be a good Christian.</hi> Religion is a serious and
solemn matter, it is a business of eternity; and
I read of Religious persons in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that
they are commended for their seriousness. It
is said of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk. 2. 19. <hi>All
that heard it wondred at the things that were
told them, but she kept all these things and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them in her heart.</hi> A Religious Christian
is a <hi>thoughtful pondering</hi> Christian, <hi>Luk. 1. 66.
All they that heard them, laid them up in their
hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this
be!</hi> A true Saint of God is a considering,
thoughtful, serious Christian; therefore a
<hi>slight-headed Christian is but a slight Christian;</hi>
for he that thinks slightly of God, will serve
him slightly, and speak slightly of him; a
slight head produceth a slight heart, and a
slight life; if the thought of God and Christ
make but slight impression upon thy soul, thy
expressions of God and Christ will be more
slight; he that thinks <hi>slightly</hi> of God, God
will slight him; a <hi>slight-headed</hi> Christian is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65780:43"/>
but a <hi>vain</hi> Christian, and all his Religion is
but vanity, but like a <hi>slight</hi> garment, or a
<hi>slight</hi> house that any wind blows down. The
Lord give you to think of this. Most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the world are <hi>slight-headed</hi> Christians,
that think <hi>slightly</hi> of sin, of God, of Christ,
of the day of Judgment. I, but you will say
unto me: <hi>Are all men that have slight heads,
hypocrites?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I will give you a <hi>distinction,</hi> that I may
not be misunderstood. There is a <hi>double slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of head,</hi> there is a <hi>slightness of head that is
a natural disease,</hi> when a man through the
weakness of his head cannot dwell long upon
any thing, when he cannot think of worldly
business long, his head will not bear it; now
thou maist be a <hi>true child</hi> of God and have a
<hi>weak head,</hi> that is not able to think long of
any thing at all. And there is a <hi>slightness of
head that is a sinful slightness,</hi> and that is, <hi>when
a man can be serious upon the things of the world,</hi>
can dwell upon worldly businesses, but <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dwell long upon the things of heaven,</hi> cannot
be serious about the things of his soul, but as
soon as ever he comes to prayer, he is <hi>slight;</hi> as
soon as ever he comes to the Sacrament, or any
holy duty, then he hath <hi>slight thoughts</hi> of God,
and of Heaven, such an one was <hi>Gallio,</hi> Act. 18.
when he saw it was a matter of Religion, he
<hi>cared for none of these things;</hi> saith he, <hi>if it</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65780:44"/>
were a matter of civil right, I would regard it;
but seeing it is matter of religion, look ye to it.
And <hi>Pilate</hi> was a <hi>slight-headed</hi> man, <hi>Ioh. 18. 38.
Pilate saith unto him, what is truth?</hi> that was
a good question; <hi>and when he had said this,
he went out again unto the Iews;</hi> he never
looked for an answer: he had a <hi>slight thought</hi>
came into his mind that was good, but he went
away, and never came and desired Christ to
give him answer. I beseech you to consider of
it, a <hi>slight-headed Christian can never be a good
Christian.</hi> If the things of God do not make
impression upon your hearts, you will never
be serious about the things of eternity. These
are the <hi>four sorts</hi> of Christians that are to be
<hi>reproved for want of meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I have <hi>another use of reproof.</hi> If those are
to be reproved that <hi>neglect</hi> this Divine duty
of meditation, <hi>much more are those to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
that meditate upon things that are wicked,</hi>
instead of meditating upon the things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Here are <hi>two sorts</hi> I would speak a little
to, either <hi>those that meditate to do evil,</hi> or <hi>those
that meditate upon the evil they have done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It reproves those that <hi>meditate to do evil:</hi>
you shall read of them, <hi>Psal. 36. 4. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
mischief upon their bed.</hi> Jer. 18. 18. <hi>Then
said they, come and let us devise devices against
Ieremiah.</hi> There are some men that <hi>plot</hi> how
to <hi>do evil,</hi> which is a double sin; it is one <hi>sin
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65780:44"/>
to do</hi> evil, it is a greater <hi>sin to plot</hi> to do evil;
a man may go to hell for his <hi>sinful plottings,</hi>
and sinful contrivances, though they never
come to light. <hi>Isa. 29. 5. Wo unto them that
seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord,
and their works are in the dark, and they say
who seeth us, and who knoweth us?</hi> The Lord will
send us to hell for all our <hi>sinful contrivances,</hi> and
vain projects, though they prove abortive.</p>
            <p>2. There are some that <hi>meditate upon the
evil they have done;</hi> as an old Adulterer will
with <hi>delight</hi> tell stories of his youthful wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,
and an old wicked man will <hi>delight</hi>
to tell tales of the sins that he hath formerly
committed; this is to act over your sins again
in Gods account; this is to lick up the old vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
this is to sin anew. I would to God you
would consider of it; a man may go to hell
for <hi>contemplative wickedness,</hi> for spiritual wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
for <hi>heart-adultery,</hi> and <hi>heart-murder,</hi>
as well as for actual wickedness; a man may
go to hell for <hi>thinking</hi> evil, as well as for
speaking evil, and doing evil; for God is a
Spirit, and he looks into the frame of your
spirits; and he will send you to hell for the
inward lust of sin, as well as for the act of
sin; and that man that repeats over the sins
of his youth with <hi>delight,</hi> this man acts them
over again in Gods account. But I will not
spend more time in the <hi>use of reprehension.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65780:45"/>
But I come to that which I especially aim
at, an <hi>Vse of Exhortation,</hi> to beseech you all
that you would subscribe to the obedience of
this <hi>Text,</hi> that you would <hi>conform your selves
to this Text,</hi> that <hi>you would accustom your selves
to his most necessary and excellent, and long ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
duty of Divine meditation.</hi> Let me with
all earnestness commend unto you the <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious
practise of this duty of Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
because it is an <hi>universal remedy</hi> against
all sin; it is a <hi>help</hi> to all goodness, it is a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative</hi>
of all godliness, it is armour of <hi>proof</hi>
against all the Devils temptations, and the
<hi>want</hi> of it is the <hi>cause</hi> of all iniquity, as you
have heard. Let me commend this to all <hi>sorts</hi>
of Christians, If it be necessary for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
your lives, it is necessary for you to <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate;</hi>
for what saith <hi>David? I considered my
ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</hi>
What made <hi>Peter</hi> when he had denied Christ,
repent and weep bitterly for what he had done?
the <hi>Text</hi> saith, when he <hi>meditated</hi> upon what
he had done, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly;</hi> it
was the <hi>meditation</hi> of his sin made him do so.
What is the reason that men repent no more
of their sins? because they do not meditate of
the bitterness of them, <hi>Ier. 8. 6. No man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth,
because no man saith what have I done?</hi>
If it be necessary for you to love God, to trust
in God, to contemn the world, it is necessary
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65780:45"/>
for you to <hi>practise this duty of meditation;</hi> what
is the reason all the <hi>Sermons</hi> you hear do you
no more good? it is for <hi>want of meditation,</hi> we
do not <hi>meditate</hi> upon what we hear. Let me
commend this <hi>duty of meditation,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Unto all <hi>Ministers.</hi> There are <hi>four</hi> things,
saith <hi>Luther,</hi> make a Minister, <hi>reading, praying,
temptation and meditation.</hi> It is not reading
makes a Scholar without prayer, nor reading
and prayer without temptation; how can he
comfort others, that was never tempted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
and then meditation; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
perswadeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to be much in <hi>meditation,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 15.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Let me commend this to great persons,
to Lords, and Earls, and Kings;</hi> David <hi>profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
of himself,</hi> Psal. 119. 148. Mine eyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the night-watchings, that I might meditate
on thy word. <hi>v.</hi> 15. I will meditate on thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.
<hi>v.</hi> 23. Princes also did sit and speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, but thy servant did meditate in thy
statutes.</p>
            <p>3. Let me commend this to you that are
Captains and Soldiers, and men that belong
unto the C&amp; <hi>Ioshua</hi> the great Captain-General
of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by God to <hi>meditate</hi> in the Law of God
day and night, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>4. Let me commend this to young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
from the example of <hi>Isaac</hi> in the Text,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65780:46"/>
that went out as his custom was, to <hi>meditate</hi>
of God, and the things of God. <hi>Isaac</hi> was
heir to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was a very rich man;
he was very rich in cattel, and very rich in
silver and gold, and <hi>Isaac</hi> was the heir of all
he had; and at even-tide he went out and
walked in the fields, and meditated upon the
things of God, <hi>meditated</hi> upon the works of
God, the things of Heaven.</p>
            <p>5. Let me commend this to you that are
Merchants, to you that are Tradesmen, that
you would spare some time for <hi>meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Let me commend this to all Women,
according to the example of <hi>Hanna,</hi> and the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> she kept all these things and
<hi>pondered</hi> them in her heart, <hi>Luk. 2. 19, 51.
But his mother kept all these sayings in her
heart.</hi> Oh let me commend this to <hi>young maids</hi>
when they are at their work, that they would
have some <hi>heavenly ejaculations,</hi> and <hi>meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of the works of God.</p>
            <p>I remember I have read of <hi>Solon,</hi> who was a
great <hi>Law-giver;</hi> saith he, <hi>There are many
good Laws made, but there wants one Law to
teach people how to practise all the other Laws,
such a Law were worth making.</hi> So give me
leave to tell you, there are many excellent
<hi>Sermons</hi> preached in this Nation, in this City,
never better preaching I dare say in <hi>London;</hi>
but there is one Sermon yet to preach, and that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65780:46"/>
is to <hi>teach you to practise all the other Sermons.</hi>
Now if I be not mistaken, this Sermon will
help you to practise all the Sermons you ever
heard; for <hi>meditation</hi> is nothing else but a
<hi>concocting</hi> of the mercies of God, a <hi>digesting</hi>
of the Promises and the Sermons we hear; it
is a Sermon to teach you to digest all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
that ever you have heard. Some men
have a great appetite, but have no digestion;
I do not complain of you that are greedy to
hear Sermons; but let me tell you, if you
have not a good <hi>digestion,</hi> your Sermons will
do no good; that which a man is eating half
an hour, requires six or seven hours to digest.
I have heard of many men that eat too much,
but I never heard of any that <hi>digested</hi> too
much; you that eat much and do <hi>not digest</hi>
it, that which you eat will turn to bad nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment;
therefore let me commend this
<hi>duty</hi> to you as one of the <hi>choicest duties</hi> of a
Christian.</p>
            <p>Now because of the <hi>excellency of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
I shall desire to speak to <hi>six Particulars</hi>
about this Doctrine of <hi>Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>place</hi> where we are to meditate.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>time</hi> when we are to meditate.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>ingredients and properties</hi> of Divine
Meditation.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>companions</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>materials</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:65780:47"/>
6. <hi>Some</hi> helps to help us to the better practise
of this duty.</p>
            <p>1. Concerning the <hi>place where we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
this duty of Divine Meditation;</hi> it is
said of <hi>Isaac</hi> in my Text, <hi>that he went out into
the fields to meditate.</hi> I do not think that this
<hi>example</hi> is obligatory, that a man is always
bound to go into the <hi>fields</hi> to meditate: I
read of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 63. that he <hi>meditated
upon God when he was in his bed:</hi> v. 16. <hi>When
I remembred thee upon my bed, and meditated
on thee in the night-watches.</hi> But this example
doth hold out thus much to us, that private
and solitary places are the fittest places for
<hi>meditation;</hi> and as Christ saith, <hi>Mat. 6. 6.
When thou prayest, enter into thy closet,</hi> (speaking
of private prayer) <hi>and when thou hast shut thy
door, pray unto thy Father that is in secret, and
thy Father which seest in secret shall reward thee
openly.</hi> So do I say, When you would <hi>meditate</hi>
solemnly of Christ, or of Heaven, or of your
sins, or of the Promises, you must enter into
your <hi>closets,</hi> or go into your gardens, or walk
into the fields; you must retire your selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some private place. It is worth marking
how the <hi>Evangelist</hi> takes notice of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Mat. 14. 23. <hi>He sent the
multitude away, and went up into a mountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to pray, and when the evening was come he
was there alone.</hi> Mark 1. 35. <hi>And in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65780:47"/>
rising up a great while before day, he went
out and departed into a solitary place, and there
prayed.</hi> Mark 6. 46. <hi>He departed into a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to pray,</hi> Luk. 6. 12. <hi>He went into a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to pray, and continued all night in prayer
to God.</hi> The Scripture makes mention of a
garden to which Christ did usually resort to
pray, and this garden Christ did often go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that when <hi>Iudas</hi> purposed to betray him,
he knew where to find him: <hi>Ioh. 18. 1. When
Iesus had spoken those words, he went where
there was a garden, and Iudas which betrayed
him knew the place, for Iesus often times resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thither with his disciples.</hi> And what did
Christ go to the garden for? he went there
to pray: <hi>Luk. 22. There was the place where
he shed drops of blood,</hi> Mat. 26. There he went
to pray, and there he went to <hi>meditate;</hi> a
garden famous for what Christ did there. Now
all this doth signifie thus much unto us, that
in the practise of this <hi>Divine duty of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
we must retire our selves, whether into
a private garden, or into our closets, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into private walks, into the fields. For if
a <hi>Scholar cannot study in a croud,</hi> he must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to some private study, some <hi>private place;</hi>
much more when you would converse with
God in the Mount, when you would medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of those glorious things of the other
world, you must shut out the <hi>society of men,</hi>
that you may the more enjoy the <hi>society of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65780:48"/>
God.</hi> It is a rare saying of <hi>Bernard, That the
bridegroom will not come to the meditating
bride</hi> (speaking of Christ who is our bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom)
<hi>but when she is alone.</hi> And therefore it
is said, <hi>Cant. 7. 11. Come my beloved let us go
forth into the fields, &amp;c.</hi> v. 12. <hi>there will I
give thee my love.</hi> God loves to visit his people
when they are alone, <hi>meditating of the things
of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I must acquaint you with <hi>two
sorts</hi> of company, there are <hi>outward</hi> company,
and there are <hi>inward</hi> company; now when
you <hi>meditate</hi> you must not only retire your
selves from <hi>outward</hi> company, but from <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
company. It is an easie matter to <hi>shut
the doors of your closets,</hi> and to be there alone,
but it is a hard matter to shut out company
from <hi>within,</hi> from your hearts as well as from
your closets. There are many men when they
are alone in a garden, or in the fields <hi>medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
they are pestered with company with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
with worldly thoughts, with voluptuous
thoughts, with vain imaginations.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Ierome</hi> complains of himself, and he
doth bewail it; saith he, <hi>When I have been in
the Wilderness alone, with wild beasts, and
have had no company but wild beasts, my thoughts
have been at</hi> Rome, <hi>among the Ladies at</hi> Rome,
<hi>among the dances of</hi> Rome. And I have heard
many Christians complain (and it is one of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65780:48"/>
greatest complaints we have) that when they
retire themselves to meditate of the Promises,
or of Christs Passion, or of the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
they are then pestered and exceedingly
troubled with worldly business, with <hi>worldly
thoughts;</hi> sometimes we are in our Counting-houses,
sometimes we are at our pleasures, at
our sports. It is an easie matter to thrust
worldly company out of our closets, but a
hard matter to <hi>thrust worldly thoughts out of
our hearts;</hi> and therefore when you meditate
you must do as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Gen. 22. 5. And
Abraham said to his young men, abide you here
with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder
and worship.</hi> So you must say to your vain
thoughts and worldly business, tarry here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
I will go up to the <hi>mount</hi> and meditate;
you must not only say to your worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but to your <hi>vain thoughts</hi> and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
tarry here below. The <hi>Rabbins</hi> say,
though there were thousands of Sacrifices of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Temple in a year, yet <hi>there was
never any flie seen in the Temple,</hi> which was
certainly a Miracle. Happy is that Christian
that can do <hi>Temple-work, without being pester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with these spiritual flies,</hi> with vain and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thoughts. Oh how happy were it if we
could come to the house of God, and that
there might be no <hi>flies</hi> there, <hi>no vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
to disturb us in our worship. I read
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65780:49"/>
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. of a <hi>plague of flies,</hi> and that <hi>plague
of flies</hi> was one of the greatest plagues that
<hi>Pharoah</hi> had; for when he was to eat his meat,
the <hi>flies</hi> got into his <hi>mouth;</hi> when he was to
drink his drink, the <hi>flies filled his cup,</hi> so that
he could neither eat nor drink; and these
swarms of flies corrupted the land; <hi>v.</hi> 24. it
is called a <hi>grievous swarm of flies.</hi> Now these
swarms of flies may be compared to our roving
<hi>wandering thoughts</hi> when we are about the
service of God; these flies corrupt the best
box of Ointment, they spoil our prayers and
our meditation. But you shall read, in <hi>Goshen</hi>
there was no <hi>plague of flies;</hi> Oh happy you
that are not plagued with these swarms of
flies, when you are in the service of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>I but you will say unto me,</hi> How shall
I keep my self from these plagues of flies? how
shall I keep my self that I may shut out inward
company when I go to the mount to meditate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> For that, you must do as <hi>Abraham</hi>
did, <hi>Gen. 15. 11. And when the fowls came
down upon the carcass, Abraham drove them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi>
so must you: when this company doth
thrust upon you and croud in, when your
<hi>vain thoughts</hi> croud in, you must stir up all
your spiritual strength to <hi>drive</hi> them away;
you must do as the high Priest did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
26. 20. when <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King would have
offered sacrifice, the Lord smote him with a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65780:49"/>
leprosie, and the high Priest took him and
thrust him out of the Temple though he was
a King; so must you, when these <hi>roving</hi>
thoughts come upon you when you are in
the Temple, or the <hi>mount of meditation,</hi> you
must thrust them out; that is, you must use
all your spiritual strength to thrust them out,
and you must pray unto God as <hi>Moses</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 8. that <hi>God would take away this
plague of flies;</hi> and do as <hi>Pharoah</hi> did, he sent
for <hi>Moses, Oh pray, pray unto God for me, that
this swarm of flies may depart out of the land:</hi>
Speak to thy godly Ministers, thy godly
friends to pray for thee, and do thou pray
for thy self, that the Lord would deliver thee
from these noisome imaginations, and fancies,
and roving thoughts that do disturb you in
the Worship of God, and in the practise of
this duty of <hi>Divine Meditation.</hi> So much for
the <hi>place</hi> where we are to meditate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>2d</hi> thing to speak to, is the <hi>time when
we are to meditate;</hi> it is said in the Text, <hi>And
Isaac went out to meditate in the eventide;</hi> it
seems <hi>Isaac</hi> found the Evening to be the fittest
time for Meditation. Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> in his excellent
Tract of <hi>Meditation,</hi> tells us out of his own
experience, that he found the <hi>evening-time</hi>
to be the fittest time for Meditation. And
there is a <hi>learned Minister</hi> in that excellent
Book of the <hi>Saints Everlasting Rest,</hi> doth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65780:50"/>
likewise from his own experience commend
the <hi>eventide</hi> for the best and suitablest time
for Meditation; and he saith <hi>from the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting
to the twi-light,</hi> and sometimes in the
night, when it is warm and clear. I will not
lay clogs upon any mans conscience; that
which is <hi>seasonable for one, is unseasonable for
another;</hi> some mens tempers are fittest to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
in the <hi>morning,</hi> and some mens tempers
are fittest to meditate in the <hi>evening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are <hi>four Propositions, four rules
of Direction concerning the time</hi> when I would
have you to meditate.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is the duty of all those that are not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by necessary business, if it be possible to set
apart some time every day for meditation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be morning, afternoon,</hi> or <hi>night:</hi> For
Meditation is the life and soul of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity;
it is that which makes you improve
all the Truths of Christian Religion, (you are
but the <hi>Skeletons</hi> of Christians without Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)
it is as necessary as your daily bread;
and as you feed your bodies every day, so you
ought to feed your souls every day with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
on your sins, or your Evidences for
Heaven, or the everlasting burnings of Hell,
or of the day of Judgment, the great account
you are to give at that day, or of the joys of
Heaven, or of the Promises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day</hi> assaulted with the <hi>Devil,</hi> therefore we
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65780:50"/>
should every day put on the armour of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Meditation,</hi> to consider how to resist the
wiles of the <hi>Devil;</hi> we are <hi>every day</hi> subject
to death, we are every day subject to
sin, therefore we should <hi>every day consider</hi>
how to prepare our selves for death, and
<hi>every day consider</hi> how to resist sin. Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is nothing else but a conversing with God,
the souls colloquie with God; and it is fit
we should every day walk with God. <hi>Divine
Meditation is nothing else but the souls transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
into heaven;</hi> the souls ascending up
into Heaven; now it is fit <hi>every day</hi> that we
should have our conversation in Heaven.
<hi>David</hi> when he describes the blessed man,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2. saith he, <hi>His delight is in the Law
of the Lord, and in his law will he meditate day
and night.</hi> And he saith of himself, though he
was a King, and had many worldly businesses,
the affairs of his Kingdom to hinder him, yet
he saith, <hi>Psal. 119. 97. Oh how do I love thy
law! it is my meditation all the day.</hi> v. 148.
<hi>Mine eyes prevent the night-watches, that I
might meditate on thy word.</hi> There is the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-time
for Meditation, <hi>I prevent the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the morning that I might meditate in thy
word.</hi> v. 15. <hi>I will delight my self in thy sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and I will meditate in thy precepts, and
have respect unto all thy ways.</hi> And <hi>Ioshua,</hi> that
great General of the Army, though he was a
man surely of great imployments, yet God
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65780:51"/>
doth lay an injunction upon him, <hi>Iosh. 1. 7, 8.
The book of the Law shall not depart out of thy
mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day &amp; night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I will go higher yet, <hi>it is our duty to set
a sufficient proportion of time apart every day:</hi>
Oh it is a hard matter to get our hearts in
tune for this duty; as it is with a <hi>Musician,</hi>
he hath a great deal of time to string, and to
tune his Instrument before he can play; the
best Christian is like an Instrument unstrung,
and untuned, he had need take a great deal of
time to get his heart in tune for <hi>Divine Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
the best Christian is like wet wood, which
will not burn, you know, without a great deal
of blowing; he had need to take a great deal of
time to kindle a holy zeal in his heart to God,
to blow up the sparks of grace that are in him.
If a man would fill a Chest that is full of dirt,
full of Gold, he must take time to <hi>empty</hi> the
Chest before he can <hi>fill</hi> it. By nature we are
all <hi>full</hi> of the world, full of the dirt of the
world, full of vanity, full of carnal creature-pleasure;
now it is our duty first to take
pains to <hi>empty</hi> the Chest before we can fill it
full of Heaven, full of God and Christ. Now
I propound this to you that have a great deal
of spare time, especially you that spend whole
afternoons in idle visitings, and vain recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Oh that I could perswade you to <hi>give
God a visit</hi> every day, and to meditate of God
and of Christ, and your selves, and the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65780:51"/>
of the other world; let me perswade you
that count it your happiness to live vainly,
that you have not so much work to do as
other men have, to <hi>set some time apart;</hi> to go
up into the mount of God, to meditate of
the things of the other world. And that I
might provoke you, let me tell you thus much,
<hi>it is the greatest curse under heaven for God to
give a man over to live an idle life,</hi> to trifle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his days in vanity; and so it is reckoned,
<hi>Psal. 78. 33. Therefore their days did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
in vanity.</hi> Therefore it is spoken as a
curse; hearken to this you that idle away
your time, there cannot be a greater curse of
God upon you, than to suffer you to idle
away your time; herein you idle away your
salvation: this <hi>direction</hi> belongs to you that
are <hi>rich men,</hi> rich Merchants, that have whole
Exchanges full of business in your heads, to
beseech you that you would contract your
worldly affairs into a narrower compass, that
you may have time for the practise of this
rare duty of Meditation, which is the <hi>very life
and soul of all duty.</hi> And the reason why you
are so lean and poor in grace, is for want of
the practise of this duty; be not always like
<hi>Martha,</hi> troubled with this and that business,
but remember <hi>Maries</hi> choice, who <hi>chose the
better part</hi> in attending upon Christ's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
I would have all rich men <hi>every day</hi>
think of that Text, <hi>Luk. 12. 20. Thou fool, this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65780:52"/>
night shall thy soul be taken from thee;</hi> and what
then will become of all thy possessions? I
confess God doth not require this at the hand
of the <hi>daily labourer,</hi> or at the hands of <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
that are not masters of their own time,
and those that are very poor and are not able
to set time apart for Meditation. But you
may remember I gave you a <hi>distinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Ejaculatory Meditation, and solemn Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;</hi>
a poor man when he is at his work,
may have a short <hi>Ejaculatory Meditation,</hi>
though he hath not time for this <hi>set and solemn
meditation;</hi> when he is at his work he may
meditate upon the <hi>Promises,</hi> and of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
and of <hi>Hell,</hi> and of <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi>
and the <hi>vanity</hi> of the world. I have heard of
a <hi>godly man</hi> was wont to say, <hi>I thank God I
can be in heaven in the midst of the croud of</hi>
Cheapside, <hi>I can meditate on the Rest I shall
have in the other world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The third <hi>Direction</hi> is this, <hi>The Sabbath-day
especially is a day wherein all sorts of people
are to busie themselves in this excellent work of
Divine Meditation;</hi> this is a day wherein the
labourer ceaseth from his work, the Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
yoke is taken off, and the labouring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the serving man have their rest;
therefore it concerns all of us to spend some
time every Sabbath-day in Meditation, to
meditate of the work of Creation, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65780:52"/>
for the <hi>Lords-day</hi> is so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ rose on that day, and Christ set
apart that day in memory of his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in memory of his Redemption; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is thy work, Oh Christian, not only
to come to the publick Ordinances, not only
to pray in thy family, but to set <hi>some time</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
for <hi>Divine Meditation;</hi> and the Lord
forgive us this sin that we have omitted this
duty so long; Oh that I could be Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument,
that there might be a resurrection
of it, that you would make conscience of it
every <hi>Sabbath-day;</hi> as you make conscience of
attending upon publick and private duties, so
you would put this as one of your Sabbath-day
duties, for it is the very Quintessence, <hi>the
life and soul of all duty;</hi> the Sabbath-day is a
type of the eternal Sabbath which we shall
keep for ever in Heaven; and shall not I think
of my <hi>eternal Sabbath</hi> upon the Sabbath? shall
not I be much in Heaven when I am keeping
a rest upon earth, that represents my eternal
rest in Heaven? let us upon our <hi>day of rest</hi>
meditate much upon our <hi>eternal rest.</hi> Oh let
us upon our <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> meditate upon the
<hi>everlasting Sabbath</hi> which we shall keep with
God Almighty, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
for ever in Heaven.</p>
            <p>4. And last <hi>Direction</hi> is this, <hi>That Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-days
are especially to be meditating-days, to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65780:53"/>
be set apart for this great work of Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;</hi>
it is the great end why Christ hath
appointed the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to shew forth the
Lords-death till he come; and saith Christ,
<hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> There are <hi>two</hi>
things make us worthy receivers of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Preparation</hi> before we come, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi>
when we are come; and though thy
<hi>Preparation</hi> be never so serious, yet if thou
dost not act aright in thy Meditation, as well
as thou hast done in thy <hi>Preparation,</hi> thou
maist lose the benefit of the Sacrament. Now
if any should ask me, What are those things,
you would have us to meditate of, when we
are <hi>come</hi> unto the Sacrament? or when we are
<hi>at</hi> the Sacrament?</p>
            <p>There are <hi>twelve Meditations</hi> which ought
to take up our Sacramental-time, which I call
<hi>twelve common-place-heads:</hi> I do not say we
can meditate upon all of them at <hi>one</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but my design is to give you matter
sufficient, that you may sometimes meditate
of <hi>one,</hi> sometimes of <hi>another.</hi> I will but name
them.</p>
            <p>1. You must <hi>meditate of the great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
love of God the Father in giving Christ,</hi>
not only to die for us upon the Cross, but in
giving him to <hi>be our food</hi> at the Sacrament;
there was nothing moved God to give Christ
but <hi>pure love,</hi> and <hi>great love: For God so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65780:53"/>
the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.
So!</hi> how? so infinitely, so inexpressibly; the
love of God in bestowing Christ is <hi>so</hi> great,
that the Angels desire to look into it. And
you that are not affected with this <hi>love,</hi> I fear
you have little share in it. That is enough to
take up one Sacrament.</p>
            <p>2. You are to meditate at the Sacrament not
only of the love of the Father in giving of his
Son, but of the love of Christ in giving himself.
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. Who loved us, and hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for us an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a
sweet smelling savour. <hi>As God gave Christ, so
Christ gave himself; as God gave himself as
man, the Godhead infused this will into the
Manhood, that Christ willingly laid down his
life:</hi> Ioh. 10. 17, 18. Therefore doth my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
love me, because I lay down my life, that I
may take it up again; no man taketh it from me,
but I lay it down of my self; I have power to
lay it down, and I have power to take it up; this
commandment have I received of my Father.
<hi>Now the</hi> love <hi>of Christ in giving himself to
be a curse for us, is a</hi> love <hi>that passeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
yet it is a</hi> love <hi>that we must study to
know. It is a riddle, but such a riddle as
the</hi> Apostle <hi>himself doth in so many express
words declare unto us,</hi> Ephes. 3. 19. That we
may be able to comprehend with all Saints what
is the breadth and length, and depth and heigth,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65780:54"/>
and to know the love of Christ which passeth
knowledg. <hi>Great is the love of Christ which
passeth knowledg; great is the love of Christ
in dying for us, and being made sin for us, and
being made a curse for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>We must meditate of the heinousness of sin;</hi>
when we were all fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphed
into such a bottomless <hi>abyss</hi> of misery,
that none but the blood of a God could deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
us; for there was an infinite breach by sin
between God and us; and this breach could
never be made up but by the blood of God.
That is a rare <hi>meditation</hi> at the Sacrament, to
meditate of the heinousness of sin; when
you see the <hi>bread</hi> broken, it was sin that caused
Christs body to be broken; and when you see
the <hi>wine</hi> poured out, it was sin caused Christs
blood to be poured out; it was sin that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Christ to suffer so much.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>You must meditate of the excellency of this
Sacramental feast;</hi> for the Sacrament is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative
Sacrifice, it is a commemoration
of that blessed Sacrifice that was offered on the
Cross for our sins; and it is an obsignation or
sealing up all the benefits of our Redemption;
and it is an exhibition of Jesus Christ, it is a
deed of gift of Christ; God goes about giving
of Christ to thee and me, and all that labour
to come worthily. Oh! there cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
feast, wherein <hi>Christ</hi> is the gift that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65780:54"/>
Christ is the banquet, <hi>Christ</hi> and
all his benefits.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>You must meditate of your own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
O Lord I am not worthy to pick up
the crumbs that fall from thy Table; I am not
worthy to eat my daily bread, much less wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to eat the Sacramental bread. Oh the
thought of this will make you say with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth,
What am I, a dead dog, that my
Lord and King should invite me to his table!</hi>
What am I, dust and ashes, sinful wretch, that
the Lord Jesus should invite me to such an
Heavenly banquet!</p>
            <p>6. <hi>You must meditate of your spiritual wants
and necessities;</hi> what grace dost thou want
that thou maist get supplied? what sin doth
bear most sway in thee, that thou maist get it
more mortified? Now the more sensible you
are of your spiritual wants, the more
will your appetite be quickned to this blessed
feast.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>You must meditate of the cursed condition
of an unworthy receiver;</hi> an unworthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is a Christ-murderer, a soul-murderer, a
body-murderer; he is guilty of the body and
blood of Jesus Christ; he eats and drinks
down his own damnation, he is guilty of
bringing diseases; <hi>For this cause</hi> (that is for
unworthy coming to the Sacrament) <hi>many are
sick, and many weak, and many die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:65780:55"/>
8. <hi>I would have you meditate of the happy
condition of those that come worthily to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi>
though you do not bring a legal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
yet if you have a Gospel-worthiness,
God will accept of you; and the bread that
we break shall be the Communion of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ; and the cup of blessing which
we bless, shall be the Communion of the
Blood of Christ to you; the communion of
all the blessings of Heaven to thy soul. It shall
be the bread of the Lord to you, and the
bread of life, and the cup of Salvation unto
you.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>I would have you meditate sometimes of
the Sacramental Elements;</hi> when you see the
bread, I would have you meditate of the <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
and proportion between bread and the
body of Christ; you know that bread is the
staff of life, so is Christ the staff of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
bread is not for dead folks but for living
folks; bread doth not beget life, but increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
and strengthneth life; so the Sacrament
is not for those that are dead in sin; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
doth not beget Grace, but nourish
and increase Grace. And then I would have
you consider the <hi>analogy</hi> between Wine and
the Blood of Christ; As Wine refresheth the
spirit, and cheereth the heart, so the Blood of
Christ cheereth the soul of every worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:65780:55"/>
10. <hi>I would have you meditate of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
actions;</hi> for all the actions of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
at the Sacrament are <hi>mystical,</hi> they all
represent Christ; Christ is to be read by a
spiritual eye in every thing that is done by
the Minister; the <hi>breaking</hi> of the bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
Christs body being <hi>broken</hi> upon the
Cross for our sins; and the <hi>pouring</hi> out the
Wine, represents how Christs Blood was <hi>pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
out for us; and the <hi>giving</hi> of the Wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
how Christ is offered and tendered
unto us; the <hi>taking</hi> of the bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
how thou by faith takes Christ for thy
everlasting comfort. Every thing in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is the object of Meditation; and it
is a rare thing for a Christian to make the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Elements to be his <hi>Bible;</hi> when he
is at the Sacrament, and when he finds his
heart dull, to look at the Elements, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of bread, and pouring out of wine,
which are all spiritual helps to raise up thy
heart unto Christ.</p>
            <p>11. You must <hi>meditate of the Sacramental
Promises;</hi> Christ Jesus hath promised, <hi>Take,
eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; do
this in remembrance of me;</hi> that is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Promise, <hi>This is my blood which is shed
for you, do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Christ
hath promised that whensoever we do take
this bread, and drink this cup worthily, he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65780:56"/>
will convey himself to us. Now we must feed
upon this <hi>promise,</hi> and come to the Sacrament
in the strength of this promise; and he hath
promised that the cup of blessing, <hi>shall be the
cup of the communion of the blood of Christ,</hi> and
the bread that is broken <hi>shall be the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body of Christ:</hi> Now we must me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon these Promises, and act faith
upon them.</p>
            <p>12. When all this is done, I mean when
thou hast received the Sacrament, then thou
must meditate what retribution to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ for this; you must say as <hi>David</hi>
doth, <hi>Psal. 116. 7. What shall I render to the
Lord for all his benefits toward me!</hi> Thou must
say to thy soul, Oh how ought I to love that
Christ that hath loved me, and became a curse
for me! how ought I to be willing to die for
that Christ that hath shed his blood for me!
Oh what singular thing shall I do for that
Christ that hath become man, that hath left
the Throne of Heaven, and hath taken my
nature, and hath given himself for me upon
the Cross, unto me at the Sacrament! <hi>what
great thing shall I return unto this God!</hi> Oh
that I were made up all of thankfulness! Oh
that I could do something worthy of this
God! This must be your Meditation, and you
must study to find out some rare piece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to do for this Christ, that hath done and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65780:56"/>
suffered so much for you; and you must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave meditating till you have found out
some singular thing. As for example, such an
enemy hath done me wrong, I will requite
him in loving him the more; I will do him
the more offices of love; that is to <hi>walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Christ,</hi> who loved me when I was an
enemy; and then there is such a deed of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
such a poor Christian his family is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
I will do this service for Christ, I will
give him some proportionable gift, some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
gift, that his soul may bless God for me.
Again, Christ Jesus this day hath given me
himself; he hath given me his body and
blood; I will go and be willing to die for
him; I will say with <hi>Thomas, Come let us die
for him;</hi> I will be willing to suffer reproach
for him, if he shall call me. These are the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
wherein you are to spend your time
when you are at the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let me say but thus much, What rare
<hi>Christians</hi> would we be if from <hi>month</hi> to
<hi>month</hi> we did thus spend our Sacramental
hours! surely great would be the benefit and
the fruit of it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the <hi>time</hi> when we
are to meditate.</p>
            <p>3. I am to speak of the <hi>properties</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
of <hi>Divine Meditation;</hi> in all holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
it is not so much the doing of the duty
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65780:57"/>
that God looks after, as the right manner of
doing the duty: It is not the hearing the
Word will please God, unless we <hi>hear the word
of God aright;</hi> therefore Christ saith, <hi>take
heed how you hear;</hi> it is not prayer that will
prevail with God, unless we pray after a right
manner, unless we pray in faith, with ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and humility; so it is not the <hi>meditation
of God and Christ,</hi> and the Promises, will do
us any good, unless we meditate after the
<hi>right manner,</hi> that God would have us to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate.</p>
            <p>Now I shall acquiant you with six <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of <hi>Divine Meditation,</hi> for the right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of performing it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Divine Meditation must be often and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,</hi>
Deut. 6. 7. there God commands, <hi>Thou
shall teach the words of the Law diligently unto
thy children, thou shalt talk of them when thou
sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the
way, and when thou lyest down, and when thou
risest up.</hi> Josh. 1. 8. <hi>The book of the law shall
not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
therein day and night.</hi> Though he was a
great Commander, and had affairs of great
concernment, yet God commands him to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
day and night in the Law of God. And
<hi>David</hi> tells us of a godly man, <hi>Psal. 1. 2. That
he will delight himself in the law of God, and
in his law will he meditate day and night.</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65780:57"/>
Psal. 119. 97, 98, 99. <hi>David</hi> professeth of
himself, though he was a King, and had many
diversions, yet saith he, <hi>Oh how do I love thy
law! it is my meditation day and night. Thou
through thy commandments hath made me wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
than my enemies; for they are ever with me,</hi>
or, it is ever with me, speaking of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God; he had them always in
his thoughts: <hi>I have more understanding than
all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</hi>
Psal. 139. 8. <hi>When I awake, I am still
with thee.</hi> What is the meaning of that? that
is by the <hi>meditation</hi> of God; in the morning
as soon as ever he awaked he begun the day
with Meditation, with some sweet pious
thought of God. It is the duty of a Christian,
as you have heard, if it be possible, if his
worldly occasions do not necessarily hinder
him, (there may, you know, be necessary avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations)
to spend some time <hi>every day</hi> in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Meditation.</hi> You that are <hi>Ladies,</hi> men of
great Estates, and have time, are to <hi>set some
solemn time,</hi> some solemn part of the day for
Meditation; but all of us are to have <hi>Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory
Meditation,</hi> though it be in our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
business.</p>
            <p>There are three <hi>Reasons</hi> to perswade you
to frequent Meditation.</p>
            <p>1. Because <hi>the oftner you meditate</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
and <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> the more you will
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65780:58"/>
know of God, and Christ, and Heaven; and
the more you will love God, and Christ; and
the more earnestly you will seek after the
things of Heaven; for you must know, the
things of Heaven are like a beautiful Picture,
the more you view them, the more will you
admire them, and seek after them to enjoy
them. I have read a story of <hi>Necrasophus,</hi> who
was an excellent Painter, that <hi>viewing wistly</hi>
a Picture, there came a Country-man by, and
seeing him view that Picture so wistly, he
asked him, Why do you look upon that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
so much? saith the Painter to him, If
you had my eyes, you would never ask me
this Question; if you knew the <hi>excellency of
this Picture,</hi> you would never ask me why I
look so much upon it. The things of Heaven,
the things of God, the Promises of God, are
most glorious and excellent things; and the
more you look into them, the more you will
look into them; and the oftenr you view
these Pictures, the more you will admire them,
and the more you will view them. God,
and Christ, and Heaven, are like unto a
bottomless Mine of treasure, the more you
dig in this Mine, the more riches you will
find in it; they are like unto a <hi>sweet cordial,</hi> the
more you chew them, the more sweetness you
will find in them. They are like an <hi>excellent
garden</hi> in the Spring-time, the oftner a man
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65780:58"/>
goes into the garden, still he finds a new flower,
and another flower, and another flower; so
the things of God, and Christ, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and Heaven, the more you walk in this
garden, the more flowers you will gather; you
will have still new flowers to pick. And the
reason why the Saints of God love God no
more, and prize Christ no more, and seek no
more after Heaven, is because they do not
meditate more of God, and Christ, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
the want of <hi>frequent meditation</hi> of them,
is the reason why we love them, and esteem
them so little, and seek so little after them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second Reason</hi> why we should <hi>frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meditate</hi> upon things Divine, is because the
oftner we meditate of God and Christ, <hi>the
more near and intimate acquaintance we shall
have with them;</hi> as you know Neighbours,
the oftner they visit one another, the more
acquainted they come one with another; and
the seldomer they visit one another, the more
estranged they are one to another. Visitation
breeds acquaintance; so the seldomer you
think of God and Christ, the more you are
estranged from them, and the less acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
you have with them; and the oftner you
meditate of God, the more intimate society
you will have with him; as I have told you,
<hi>Divine Meditation</hi> is nothing else but a dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the things of God, a conversing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65780:59"/>
with God and Christ, and the Promises, and
it will be matter of rare comfort to a child
of God, when he lies upon his death-bed, and
is going out of the world, to consider, <hi>I am
now going to a God that I am acquainted
withal,</hi> that <hi>I am not a stranger to: I am going
to heaven, where I have been often in my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
It is reported of Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> when he
was dying, he used these words, <hi>Blessed be
God though I change my place, yet I shall not
change my company; for I have walked with God
while I lived, and now I go to rest with God.</hi>
A man that is often in <hi>meditation,</hi> is often in
Heaven, often walking with God and Christ,
and the Promises; and when he dies, he goes
to enjoy the Promises, and to be and to live
for ever with this Christ. It is a sad and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate
thing for a man when he comes to
die, to think of God as a stranger, to think
of Heaven as a place where he hath never
been, he hath hardly had a thought of it all
his life. I verily perswade my self, it is one
reason that the Saints of God are so unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to die, because they have <hi>no more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with God in this life,</hi> they think of him
as a stranger; the more you are acquainted
with God while you live, the more willing
you will be to die to go to him; for death
to a child of God is nothing else but a resting
with God, with whom he walked while he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65780:59"/>
lived; to rest in the bosom of God, in whose
bosom he hath often been by <hi>holy meditation</hi>
when he was alive.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>You must be often and frequent in the duty
of Divine Meditation, by often using it to make
it more easie;</hi> there is great complaint of the
difficulty of this duty; it hath been often said
to me, <hi>Sir, there is no duty in the world so
hard as Divine Meditation:</hi> and it is true, it
is a hard matter to keep the heart close in
Meditation of Divine things; and therefore
you must accustom your selves to this duty,
and use will make perfectness, <hi>usus promptos
facit;</hi> by often doing it, at last through grace
it will become easie. When a young youth is
bound Prentice to a Manual Trade, at first it
seems very hard to learn his Trade, but by
long custom at last he is very expert in it. A
man that is to go up a hill every morning, at
first he pants and breathes, and cannot get up
the hill, within a little while he can get up
with ease; so this duty of Divine Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though it be exceeding <hi>difficult,</hi> because
it is exceeding <hi>spiritual,</hi> yet by <hi>often</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
practising of it, through the assistance
of Gods Spirit, it will become at last very
easie; whereas the seldomness of the practice
of this duty makes it difficult, and intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any thing makes it very hard. A man
that learns the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongues, or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65780:60"/>
learn to speak <hi>French,</hi> if he intermit the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>eleven</hi> or <hi>twelve years,</hi> he will quickly
forget to speak it; so long omission of this
duty is the reason why it is so <hi>difficult;</hi> would
you but resolve to practise it for one twelve
month, you would find it at the twelve
months end an easie duty, through the help
of God.</p>
            <p>The second property is this, <hi>Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
must be solemn and serious;</hi> though we
must accustom our selves to this duty, yet we
must take heed of customariness and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the duty; <hi>formality</hi> in good duty, is the
dead fly that spoils the box of precious
ointment; God hates a formal Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
he hates a formal prayer, a formal
hearer of the word; formality in Gods
service is like the <hi>plague of locusts,</hi> of which
you read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. that did eat up all the
green things in the land; <hi>formality</hi> in good
duties eats up all the beauty and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and benefit of a good duty; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
God hates more than formality in his
service; therefore you must take heed above
all things of being <hi>formal</hi> in the practice of
this duty of Meditation; it must be <hi>solemn and
serious,</hi> and you must be very intent about
it; <hi>slight</hi> thoughts of God will make but a
slight impression upon the affections; and he
that thinks slightly of God, will serve him
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65780:60"/>
slightly, and love him slightly; he that thinks
slightly of sin, will slight sin; he that thinks
slightly of God, God will slight him. And
the reason why we serve God with so little
affection, and so little devotion and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
is <hi>because we meditate slightly of God;</hi> for
<hi>slight thoughts</hi> of God work but a <hi>slight</hi> heart,
and a <hi>slight</hi> conversation. I will give you an
<hi>instance</hi> or <hi>two</hi> of this slight way of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. you shall read of certain men,
that when Christ was preaching had a very
good ejaculation, <hi>ver. 34. Lord,</hi> (say they)
<hi>evermore give us of this bread;</hi> it was a sweet
Meditation, but it was but a short, a <hi>slight</hi>
and formal one; for at the end of the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
these men forsook Christ; it was not a <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi>
and <hi>serious</hi> Meditation, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 38. you
read of <hi>Pilate, Pilate saith unto him, what is
truth?</hi> here is a good <hi>question</hi> that arose from
some inward thought that he had; and when
he had said this, he went out again, he never
thought of it more, he never tarried to hear
an <hi>answer;</hi> but now our care must be to be
very <hi>solemn</hi> and serious in this work of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Meditation; let me give you an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; a Heathen man
was <hi>offering</hi> Sacrifice to his God, the <hi>Priest</hi>
that held the Censor, the Chafing-dish, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Incense was, there was a spark of fire
fell upon his hand, and he was so <hi>intent</hi> and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65780:61"/>
unwilling to hinder the Sacrifice, that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
his hand rather to be <hi>burnt,</hi> than he
would intermit the Sacrifice; this shews how
devout and intent this Priest was, even in the
service of the Heathenish God; and <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
tells a story of a <hi>Lady</hi> that being to
make a <hi>precious ointment,</hi> she calls in all her
<hi>handmaids</hi> to help her; so saith he, when we
converse with God in any holy duty, we must
call in all our handmaids, all our <hi>affections,</hi>
when we are making any holy ointment; the
meaning is this, when you are conversing with
God by <hi>meditation,</hi> or conversing with Christ,
or the Promises, you must call in <hi>all your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
to assist you, you must be very solemn
and serious, and intent upon this work. And
yet I must give you <hi>one caution</hi> here, you must
take heed <hi>you be not over-intent;</hi> though you
must be serious, you <hi>must not be over-serious.</hi>
I have heard a story of a godly Minister, Mr.
<hi>Welsh,</hi> that was one day <hi>meditating of eternity,</hi>
and he was so <hi>serious</hi> in the thoughts of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that <hi>he fell into a trance,</hi> into a swound,
that they could hardly ever recover life in
him again, he was so swallowed up in that
Meditation, he was too serious; we must be
serious, but not <hi>over-serious;</hi> we must do as
good travellers do, that will be careful not to
<hi>over-ride</hi> their horses, lest they tire; they will
ride moderately, that so they may hold out
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65780:61"/>
to their journeys end; so must we be serious,
but we must be moderate, <hi>not over-serious;</hi>
we must remember we have a body of flesh,
that is not able to bear <hi>over-much seriousness,</hi>
in these weighty Meditations of Eternity, and
God, and Christ, and Heaven.</p>
            <p>3. Divine Meditation must not only be notion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and speculative, but practical and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate;
<hi>therefore consideration and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are not only</hi> acts of the head, <hi>but</hi> acts of
the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 39. Know therefore this day
and consider it in thy heart. <hi>There are</hi> three
doors, <hi>as I may so speak, that Meditation must
get</hi> into, <hi>or else it is of no use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It must get into the <hi>understanding,</hi> that
must <hi>ponder</hi> the things of Heaven; but it must
not tarry there: But,</p>
            <p>2. It must get <hi>into the door of the heart and
affections to stir them up;</hi> for the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
must be as a Divine pair of Bellows to
kindle a Divine fire in the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to inflame and raise them up, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
saith, <hi>Psal. 39. While I was musing the
fire burned;</hi> we must so muse upon God and
Christ, that our affections may as it were
<hi>burn within us,</hi> as the <hi>Disciples hearts
burnt within them,</hi> while Christ was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>It must get into the door of the conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that is, we must so meditate of Christ as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65780:62"/>
to live according to the life of Christ;</hi> and so to
meditate of God as to obey the Commands of
God. And unless your Meditation get into
these <hi>three</hi> doors, it is of no use; the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>
to the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> is like the
<hi>nurse</hi> to the <hi>child;</hi> you know the office of the
<hi>nurse</hi> is to <hi>prepare meat</hi> for the <hi>child,</hi> to chew
and cut it, that the <hi>child</hi> may eat it; so the
work of the <hi>understanding</hi> is to prepare Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truths for the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> that
the heart may close with them, and eat and
digest them; but if the <hi>nurse</hi> should eat the
meat she chews, and give nothing to the child,
the child may starve for all the nurse; so
though the <hi>understanding</hi> doth chew never
such glorious Truths, if it doth not convey
them to the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> it is of no
use; there is many a man spends his time in
Meditation, as a <hi>Butterflye</hi> feeds upon the
flower, sucks the flower, not to be <hi>fruitful</hi> and
<hi>useful,</hi> but meerly to <hi>paint</hi> her <hi>wings;</hi> so he
studies and ponders of Divine things meerly
to paint his wings, to get curious language of
God and Christ, and <hi>curious</hi> notions of sin, and
the promises, but because he doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
them into his heart and affections, he is
never the holier, never the better for his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;
but true Meditation is this, when
we so meditate of Christ as to find vertue
coming out of Christ to cure the bloody issue
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65780:62"/>
of our sins; to meditate of him so as to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into him; when we so <hi>meditate</hi> of God,
as to <hi>love</hi> God, and <hi>desire</hi> after God, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice</hi>
in God, and <hi>live</hi> according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God; when we so meditate of sin
as to hate and abhor it, and turn from it; so
meditate of the promises as to <hi>close</hi> with them,
when by frequent musing of God there is a
holy <hi>fire</hi> of Divine love kindled towards
God; as it is in <hi>Psal. 104. 34. My meditation
of him shall be sweet.</hi> When we so meditate on
God, as it gets into our affections to sweeten
the thoughts of God unto our souls, then the
<hi>meditation of God is sweet;</hi> this is the reason
why many times an honest plain-hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
finds more benefit by the <hi>practise</hi> of this
Divine Meditation than a <hi>great Scholar;</hi> for
a great <hi>Scholar</hi> will meditate to find out some
glorious expressions, some <hi>curious notions.</hi> As
a man that reads a <hi>book</hi> meerly for the <hi>fine
language,</hi> and a man that hears a <hi>Sermon</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to feast his ears, because of the <hi>eloquence</hi> of
the Sermon, and goes home never the holier,
never the <hi>better;</hi> but now the honest <hi>plain-hearted
Christian</hi> meditates of the things of
Heaven, that he may be made the more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly;
he meditates of God that he may <hi>love</hi>
and <hi>fear</hi> him more; he meditates of Christ,
that he may <hi>prize</hi> him more; he meditates of
sin, that he may <hi>hate</hi> it more; and of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65780:63"/>
that he may <hi>love them</hi> more; though he
cannot find out these curious notions that a
Scholar doth, yet his heart is more affected
many times than the heart of a <hi>greater Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
if he be <hi>not godly.</hi> Divine Meditation is of
no use unless it be <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>affectiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Property is this, Divine Meditation must
be particular and applicative;</hi> for <hi>generals</hi> will
not work at all; the Philosopher saith, that
fire in general doth not burn; it is this fire
that burns; a sword in general doth not cut,
it is this sword cuts; so confused meditation
of heaven, God and Christ, will do you little
good; but if ever you would get good by
the practise of <hi>meditation,</hi> you must come
down to <hi>particulars;</hi> and you must so medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of Christ, as to <hi>apply</hi> Christ to thy soul;
and so meditate of Heaven, as to <hi>apply</hi> Heaven
to thy soul; this is mine, this is my portion,
Christ is my portion, he is <hi>Iehovah</hi> my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
<hi>Nam quid est Deus, si non est meus?</hi>
What am I the better for Heaven, or for Christ,
if they be not mine? what comfort can I
have to meditate of Christ, if I have no inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in him, if I cannot <hi>apply</hi> him? what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
can I have to meditate of Heaven, if I
have no right to Heaven; I meditate of a
place that doth not belong to me. Therefore
the greatest part of Meditation is <hi>Application;</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65780:63"/>
you must apply the things you meditate of, to
your own <hi>particular,</hi> and that man that in his
meditation of Christ can say with <hi>Thomas,
My God and my Lord,</hi> is of all men the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest;
blessed is that man that can say, <hi>my
God and my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>four</hi> things that work mightily
upon the heart, <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Excellency, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi>
and <hi>Perpetuity;</hi> the heart is much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with things that are <hi>excellent,</hi> especially
when they are <hi>necessary;</hi> especially if I have
a <hi>propriety</hi> in them, and this propriety be
<hi>perpetual;</hi> and thrice happy is that man that
can say all these <hi>four</hi> concerning God and
Christ; that when he meditates of the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
of God, and Christ, and Heaven, and the
<hi>necessity</hi> of enjoying them; when he can add
a <hi>propriety,</hi> all these are mine, God is my God,
Christ is my righteousness, and Heaven is my
inheritance, and my inheritance <hi>for ever.</hi> Oh
this man is in Heaven already, that can make
this <hi>application</hi> upon Scripture-grounds. And
therefore be sure in the practise of this duty,
your meditation be <hi>applicative;</hi> though a
<hi>medicine</hi> be never so soveraign, it doth you
no good unless you <hi>apply</hi> it; the water in the
fountain will never do you good, unless it be
<hi>brought</hi> to you by a cistern, conveyed to you
some way or other; so the meditation of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65780:64"/>
God, Christ and Heaven, will little avail, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you make <hi>application;</hi> and this is especially
to be used at the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> the work you
are to do at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is <hi>meditation,</hi> and
in all Sacramental meditation you must be
sure to join application; when you meditate
of the breaking of the bread, of the body of
Christ that was broken for you, you must
<hi>apply</hi> it, it was broken for <hi>me;</hi> and when you
see the wine poured out, you must medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of the blood of Christ, that was poured
out upon the Cross, you must make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by faith, that is the great act of faith,
This blood was poured out for <hi>me,</hi> this body
was broken for <hi>me,</hi> and now God offers Christ,
God gives Christ to <hi>me,</hi> there is the sweetness
in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> Property, <hi>Divine Meditation must
be calm and quiet;</hi> there are many well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Christians that in the practise of this
duty, will force themselves too much; this is
proper to young beginners, that when they
meditate of their sins, will <hi>force</hi> themselves
into <hi>tears;</hi> and when they meditate of Christ
will force themselves into <hi>joy;</hi> it is ordinary
when young Christians meditate, because they
cannot find their affections wrought upon,
they will use <hi>violence</hi> to their affections, and
force out tears or joy, according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65780:64"/>
of the thing they meditate upon; just
like the man, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 7, 8. the <hi>lame man</hi> that
was cured; as soon as ever <hi>Peter</hi> took him by
the hand and lift him up, immediately his feet
and ancle-bones received strength, and he
leaping up, stood and walked, and entred with
him into the Temple; the poor man never
walked in all his life, he was lame from his
mothers womb; as soon as ever he found his
legs, he fell a leaping presently; he did not
leap afterwards, but walked ordinarily as other
men; but he was so overjoyed, that he forced
himself to a kind of leaping; so there are
many Christians that when they first set upon
this duty, because they find their hearts very
dead and dull, therefore they will offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to their affections, and force themselves
to tears or joy. But you must not do this, the
best way is to wait in the practise of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the coming down of God; to <hi>wait</hi> for
the consolation of <hi>Israel,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
Luk. 2. 25. <hi>There was one Simeon a man in
Ierusalem, who was just and devout, waiting for
the consolation of Israel.</hi> So must we in the use
of this blessed duty <hi>wait</hi> upon God for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
comfort; and while we are waiting, God
will come in, <hi>Isa. 30. 18. Blessed are all they
that wait upon the Lord.</hi> ver. ult. <hi>They that
wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength,
they shall mount up with wings as eagles.</hi> You
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65780:65"/>
must continue waiting, and be assured the
Lord whom you seek will come in, and you
shall find your hearts melted if you go on in
a <hi>calm, quiet, waiting posture.</hi> As <hi>Bernard,</hi> who
was a man much accustomed to this duty of
meditation, when he went to meditate and
pray, he found his heart at <hi>first</hi> very dull; at
<hi>last</hi> the visitations of the Almighty came upon
him, and he felt his heart <hi>warm,</hi> he had the
appearances of the Lord to his soul, that he
cried out <hi>rara hora, brevis mora,</hi> it comes but
seldom (but sometimes it comes, blessed be
God), it tarries too short a while; Oh that
it would continue; <hi>wait</hi> upon God in the
<hi>practise of Divine Meditation,</hi> and you shall
find the elapses of the Holy Ghost, the Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God coming upon your souls, and
filling you full of Heavenly comfort.</p>
            <p>6. And lastly, <hi>This Divine Meditation must
be persevereing;</hi> you must <hi>persevere</hi> in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though you cannot at first find the benefit
and comfort that you expect. There are many
Christians that have set upon this work of
Meditation, and finding it too hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and meeting with so much opposition in
their hearts, wandering thoughts, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of spiritual distempers, they have been
discouraged, and <hi>laid it aside,</hi> which certainly
they <hi>ought not</hi> to have done. I have read of
the <hi>Leopard,</hi> when it looks after his prey, when
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65780:65"/>
it looks after his prey, when it hath a beast
in <hi>view,</hi> that it would prey upon the manner
of its hunting, is to take <hi>three or four great
skips,</hi> and if it cannot take the beast in three
or four skips, then it <hi>leaves</hi> it, it is so furious
and hasty. So there is many a poor Christian
<hi>skips</hi> into the duty of Meditation, as it were,
by taking <hi>three or four leaps,</hi> and sees he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
compass it, he cannot find the benefit and
comfort he would, and therefore he <hi>lays it
aside;</hi> this is a great <hi>fault:</hi> you must wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, as I said in the former, you <hi>must
continue and persevere, and go on in this duty:</hi>
And I have <hi>four arguments</hi> to perswade you
to persevere in this duty.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>necessity</hi> of this duty; it is a
duty absolutely necessary, as I have told you;
it is the life of all other duties; prayer will
do you no good unless it be joined with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
<hi>Oratio sine, meditatione est arida,</hi>
saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> Prayer without Meditation is
dry, and luke warm, and cold; and the reason
why our prayers are like so many <hi>dead carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of prayers,</hi> is because we do not join <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
with <hi>prayer: sermons</hi> do us no good
without meditation. Meditation is the <hi>life</hi> of
all Religion, and that which puts life into all
other duties. It is of great <hi>necessity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must <hi>not be weary</hi> of well-doing, you
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65780:66"/>
must <hi>persevere,</hi> for there is no grace crowned
without perseverance.</p>
            <p>2. Consider the <hi>excellency of this duty,</hi> it
is the souls transmigration to Heaven, the souls
transfiguration, the souls going up to Heaven
to converse with God and Christ, and the
things of eternity; it is a <hi>rare</hi> duty, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
as your daily bread; and certainly God
conveys much of himself in the practise of
this duty. As <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> when he was in the
Mount, was <hi>transfigured, and his face shined
like the Sun.</hi> So certainly you that are much
in the <hi>mount of meditation,</hi> you that often go
up to meditate of God and Christ, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and sin, your <hi>faces will shine,</hi> you will
be taller than other Christians in grace by the
head.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Study the mischiefs that come by the want
of practising this duty;</hi> it is not eating meat
that nourisheth you, but the <hi>digesting</hi> of it;
meat may be set before a man, and he may
eat a great deal, but if he doth not digest it,
he will never be nourished. Meditation is a
<hi>digesting</hi> of all the things of God; it is not the
hearing a Sermon doth you good, but the
<hi>meditating on what you hear;</hi> if a man hath a
plaister and lays it to his sore, and take it off
as soon as he hath laid it on, it will do no
good at all; so when you hear a Sermon, if
you forget it as soon as ever you have heard
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65780:66"/>
it, if you do not <hi>chew,</hi> meditate and ponder
upon what you hear, you will <hi>never get any
good.</hi> As the beast that chewed not the cud
was an unclean beast, so the <hi>unmeditating
Christian</hi> is an <hi>unclean Christian.</hi> The reason
why we have so many <hi>lean kine,</hi> pardon my
expression, that devour the fat, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the fatter; I mean so many lean Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
that devour hundreds of Sermons, that
will hear three or four a day, and are <hi>never
the beetter,</hi> never the fatter; what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this, because it comes in at one ear, and
goes out at the other, one Sermon justles out
another; but they <hi>never meditate,</hi> ponder and
consider what they hear, that is the reason
why you are so lean in grace. You know
there are many hours required to digest a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
meat eaten in a little while; so a man
should be many hours digesting a Sermon that
he hears in one hour. God and Christ are like
a <hi>picture</hi> that hath a <hi>curtain</hi> drawn over it;
now a man will never judg of the picture till
the curtain be withdrawn; Meditation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the <hi>taking aside the curtain,</hi> and
viewing of God. To an unmeditating Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
God is like the Sun in a cloud; to an
unconsidering Christian Christ is like a <hi>jewel</hi>
in a leathern purse; now <hi>meditation opens</hi>
the purse, and takes out the jewel, and looks
upon it; Meditation draws aside the curtain,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65780:67"/>
and views God, and beholds the glorious
things of God.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Consider, that by persevering in this duty it
will at last grow easie;</hi> it is I confess a very
up-hill duty, a very spiritual Heavenly duty;
but as a man that every day goes up a hill,
though at first it be very difficult, he blows
and pants as if his soul would go out of him,
but by <hi>persevering</hi> in it he can go up the hill
<hi>without pain or weariness;</hi> so though it be an
up-hill, a hard duty, yet if you that have
time, as many of you have, would but set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
this work and <hi>persevere</hi> in it, and labour
that your Meditation be <hi>applicative</hi> and <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionative;</hi>
let me assure you, you would
quickly conquer the difficulty by the help of
God; let a man be to <hi>kindle</hi> a fire, if the wood
be wet he must <hi>blow, and continue blowing,</hi> and
at last he will conquer it; if he fling away the
bellows he will never make the fire burn: but
he must <hi>continue</hi> blowing till he hath extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the moisture, and conquered the wood;
so when you go to meditate of God, and
Christ, of the Promises, of Heaven, of
your sins, though you find your hearts dead
and dull, and full of vain roving thoughts,
and you are mightily out of tune, and much
discouraged, you must <hi>go on</hi> blowing still,
you must blow, and blow, and blow, and at
last the fire will kindle, the great God of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65780:67"/>
Heaven and earth will come in and help you.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the <hi>third particular,</hi>
the properties of <hi>Divine Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I must speak to the <hi>companions of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
There are <hi>two companions</hi> you must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>join with it,</hi> or <hi>at least ordinarily.</hi> I am
sure that <hi>one</hi> you must always join, <hi>one is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
the <hi>other is praying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. You must <hi>join prayer</hi> with your medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and therefore here in my <hi>Text</hi> the <hi>same
word</hi> that signifies to <hi>meditate</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
signifies to <hi>pray: And Isaac went out to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;</hi>
the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>He went out
to pray or to meditate;</hi> and therefore in the
Margent it is put; <hi>And Isaac went out to pray.</hi>
And in the old Translation it is, <hi>And Isaac went
out to pray;</hi> and in the new Translation it is, <hi>He
went out to meditate.</hi> The same <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
that signifies to <hi>meditate,</hi> signifies to <hi>pray,</hi> to
teach us, that we must always <hi>join meditation</hi>
and <hi>prayer</hi> together. As for example, when you
meditate of your sins, you must put up a
<hi>prayer</hi> to God, that you may so meditate of
your sins as to get your hearts <hi>humbled</hi> for
them; and when you meditate of Heaven,
you must join prayer with your meditation,
and lift up a prayer that the Lord would help
you so to meditate of Heaven, as to make
you fit for Heaven, when <hi>I say prayer,</hi> I do
not mean a <hi>set formal prayer,</hi> but a <hi>short
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65780:68"/>
prayer;</hi> when you go up the hill of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
you must not <hi>set</hi> your selves at prayer,
but only <hi>join</hi> short prayer, beseeching God
that he would bless it unto you: <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 29.
when Christ went up to <hi>prayer,</hi> while he was
praying, his countenance was changed, he was
<hi>transfigured;</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> while he was a
<hi>praying,</hi> the Angel of the Lord appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; he had glorious appearances while
he was praying, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. when we go up to
the hill to <hi>meditate</hi> and to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> and
<hi>meditate,</hi> we shall be sure to meet with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
from God, with glorious transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
it is a rare saying of <hi>Bernard, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without prayer</hi> is <hi>infertilis, barren and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm;
prayer without meditation</hi> is <hi>arida,</hi> dry.
And as <hi>one</hi> saith very well, writing of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<hi>The reason why the prayers of many of
the Saints of God are but carcases of prayer, is
because they do not join meditation and prayer.</hi>
And the reason why their meditation is no
more powerful, is because they do not join
<hi>prayer</hi> with their <hi>meditation;</hi> for meditation
without prayer is altogether useless and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable;
you must not meditate in your own
strength.</p>
            <p>2. You must <hi>join reading with your medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
understand me aright, I propound this
to <hi>weak Christians</hi> that want a stock of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg;
there are some Christians that are a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65780:68"/>
Walking-library, they are Books themselves,
they <hi>need not a Book</hi> to help them to <hi>meditate.</hi>
But you that are <hi>weak Christians,</hi> my advice is
this, <hi>that you would join reading with your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</hi>
As for example, would you meditate
of Christ? go and take the <hi>Bible,</hi> and <hi>read</hi> the
History of his Passion; and when thou readest
any thing remarkable, <hi>lay thy book aside,</hi> and
meditate seriously of that passage. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
when thou comest to <hi>read of Christ
sweating drops of blood;</hi> that Christ in a cold
Winter night upon the cold ground for thy
sake should shed drops of blood: <hi>lay thy book
aside, and meditate of these drops of blood;</hi> Oh
the <hi>wrath</hi> of God that he then suffered! and
so when thou comest to read what Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
upon the Cross, when he cried out, <hi>My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!</hi> lay
aside thy Book, and meditate of the love of
Christ, that was forsaken for thy sake, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of <hi>outward comfort,</hi> I mean <hi>not in regard
of union;</hi> He was forsaken that thou maist
not be forsaken. So likewise, wouldest thou
meditate on the <hi>Promises?</hi> if thou be a weak
Christian, <hi>take a Book</hi> that treats of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and when thou <hi>readest</hi> any Promise that
is suitable to thee, <hi>lay the Book aside</hi> and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
of that Promise till thy heart be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with it, and labour that it may <hi>take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
upon thy soul. Saith <hi>Bernard, Long
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65780:69"/>
reading without meditation, never made a good
Scholar, it is always barren.</hi> And Meditation
without reading leads many a <hi>weak Christian</hi>
over to error. And therefore when you set a
time apart for Meditation, join <hi>prayer</hi> and
<hi>reading</hi> with your meditation.</p>
            <p>Now here I must give you <hi>two Cautions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>You must not read much, lest it hinder
you meditation;</hi> as you must not be <hi>large</hi> in
<hi>prayer,</hi> that it may not hinder your meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so you must not be <hi>large</hi> in reading when
you go to meditate; for prayer and reading
are in order to meditation.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>When you are at the Sacrament, you must
lay aside all reading;</hi> you must <hi>meditate</hi> at the
Sacrament <hi>without reading;</hi> the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ at the Sacrament preacheth to the
<hi>eye.</hi> And our <hi>Sacramental Elements</hi> are our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Bible;</hi> every action of the Minister
is mystical and spiritual; the breaking of the
bread, and the pouring out of the wine is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;
Christ Jesus is represented in all that
is done at the Sacrament. And therefore when
you begin to be drawn dry, as I may so speak,
and you know not what to meditate on, you
must instead of <hi>reading, look upon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
it is a sanctified way to quicken you
to holiness; and you must look upon them
with a <hi>spiritual</hi> eye, with an <hi>understanding</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:65780:69"/>
eye, as knowing what those Elements signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
and the sight of the Elements will suggest
matter of meditation. This I speak because I
see many <hi>weak Christians,</hi> and I believe they
do it upon honest Principles, not being able
to hold out in meditation, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from wandring thoughts, <hi>read in the
Bible;</hi> this in it self is <hi>not sinful;</hi> but this is
not <hi>sutable</hi> nor proper; for certainly the
proper way of meditation at the Sacrament is
to be raised up in the <hi>Sacramental Elements,</hi>
the Sacramental <hi>actions,</hi> the Sacramental <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;</hi>
and therefore thou must make the
whole Sacramental frame and carriage to be
<hi>thy Bible</hi> at the Sacrament, and learn to be
raised up by that to Heavenly Meditation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth Particular in order, is the Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
of Meditation;</hi> and here I am to shew you
<hi>what are those Divine Truths</hi> that we are to
meditate upon; this is a <hi>subject</hi> of large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension;
for the truth is, there is no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
object,</hi> but it doth deserve our serious
meditation. Give me leave to make you a
<hi>Common-place-book of Divine Meditation;</hi> I will
lay down <hi>some heads</hi> of Divinity, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ought to spend his life in, <hi>meditating
upon,</hi> sometimes upon <hi>one</hi> of them, sometimes
upon <hi>another</hi> of them: as for example, he
that would <hi>avoid all sin,</hi> and <hi>thrive in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:65780:70"/>
must meditate frequently and seriously
of <hi>Death,</hi> of <hi>Iudgment,</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi>
these are called <hi>quatuor Novissima,</hi> the four
last things.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of <hi>death;</hi> now I will
not shew you <hi>how</hi> you should go about to
<hi>meditate of death,</hi> but I will give you <hi>some
heads</hi> to help you.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the <hi>certainty of
death;</hi> there is nothing so <hi>certain</hi> as that thou
<hi>must die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. You must meditate of the <hi>uncertainty of
death;</hi> there is nothing so <hi>uncertain as the time
when we must die;</hi> death comes <hi>certainly,</hi> and
death comes <hi>uncertainly,</hi> death comes sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
there is no <hi>Almanack</hi> can tell you when
your death shall come; your <hi>Almanacks</hi> will
tell you when the next Eclypse of the Sun and
Moon will be, but they will not tell you
when the eclypse of your lives shall be. And
death comes <hi>irresistibly,</hi> it comes like pain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a woman in travel, it comes like an armed
Giant, that will not be resisted when it
comes.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate concerning <hi>your fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for death;</hi> whether thou hast got thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
thy evidences ready for death; whether
thou art a wise Virgin, or a foolish Virgin?
whether thou hast got oyl into thy lamp,
or no?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65780:70"/>
4. You must meditate <hi>concerning death, how
you may so live as to be above the hurt of death,</hi>
that death might be an out-let to all misery,
and an in-let to all happiness.</p>
            <p>5. You must meditate <hi>how to live in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
expectation of,</hi> and continual preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for death.</p>
            <p>6. You must especially meditate <hi>how to be
free from the slavish fear of death;</hi> there are
many of Gods children that live all their
lives long <hi>under the bondage of the fear of death;</hi>
and it is the excellency of a Christian to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
how to be above the hurt and fear of
death, and for that purpose you must look
upon death with <hi>Scripture-spectacles,</hi> you must
look upon death as the going from the prison
of this life, to the palace of Heaven, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
by Christ, as perfumed by Christ, as a
Serpent without a sting, as a passage to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life.</p>
            <p>Thus you see how you must meditate of
Death.</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate of the <hi>day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the <hi>terribleness</hi> of
the day of Judgment; it is called <hi>the terror of
the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. It is called by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, <hi>the great and terrible day of
Iudgment;</hi> In which <hi>Iesus Christ will come in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65780:71"/>
flaming fire to render vengeonce upon all those
that know him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. You must meditate of the <hi>great assizes
that will be kept at that day,</hi> in which all the
men, and women, and children, that ever have
lived since <hi>Adam</hi>'s time to the end of the
world, shall all appear before the Tribunal-seat
of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate of the <hi>great account
you are to give to God at that day,</hi> the strict,
the exact, the particular account; it is a day
in which we must answer for all our idle
words, for all our idle thoughts, in which
all our secret sins shall be made manifest.</p>
            <p>4. You must meditate of the <hi>great separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that shall be made at that day,</hi> when the
<hi>goats</hi> shall be placed on the left hand, and
the <hi>sheep</hi> on the right hand, there will be a
perfect separation. In this life goats and sheep
are mingled together, but at that day there
will not be one sheep on the left, nor one goat
on the right hand.</p>
            <p>5. You must meditate of the <hi>happy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a child of God at that great and terrible
day of Iudgment;</hi> it shall be a day of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,
in which he shall be crowned with
glory and immortality; it shall be a day of
salvation to him.</p>
            <p>6. You must meditate of the <hi>cursed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an ungodly man at the day of Iudgment;</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65780:71"/>
it shall be a day of perdition and everlasting
destruction to him.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>You</hi> must meditate of Heaven.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
that are so great, that eye never saw, nor
ear heard, nor ever can it enter into the
heart of man to conceive the greatness of
them.</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate sometimes of the
<hi>Beatifical Vision,</hi> of the blessed sight of God
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and of the
happiness that that soul shall enjoy that is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to that blessed sight; for because God
is infinitely perfect, and all perfection is in
God, whosoever is admitted to the sight of
God, beholds and enjoys all things in God.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate of the <hi>perfection</hi> of
the happiness of Heaven.</p>
            <p>4. You must meditate of the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of
the happiness of Heaven; there you shall
have fulness of joy, and pleasures at the right
hand of God for evermore.</p>
            <p>5. You must meditate of <hi>your fitness for
heaven,</hi> whether you are made meet and fit
to partake of that glorious inheritance: you
must meditate whether God hath sent Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
down into thee; for no man shall ever go
up to Heaven, but Heaven must first come
down to him; you must meditate whether
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65780:72"/>
that Christ that hath prepared Heaven for
thee, hath prepared thee for Heaven.</p>
            <p>6. You must meditate <hi>what you must do,</hi> that
you may be meet to go to Heaven, how you
may lead your lives so that you may be sure
at last to obtain Heavens eternity.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>You must</hi> meditate of Hell; <hi>as</hi> Bernard
<hi>saith, you must</hi> go often down into hell by your
meditation while you live, and you shall be sure
not to go down to hell when you die. Descenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
vivenles, &amp; non descendemus morientes, <hi>as</hi>
Chrysostome <hi>saith excellently; if the not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Hell would free you from Hell, I would
never have you think of</hi> hell; <hi>but whether
you think of it or no,</hi> Hell-fire burns, and your
not thinking of it will bring you thither. <hi>And
the reason why so many go to Hell when they</hi>
die, <hi>is because they do not think of Hell while
they</hi> live.</p>
            <p>1. You must <hi>study the punishment of loss;</hi>
what a cursed thing it is to be excluded from
the presence of God for ever and ever; that
is one great part of hell to be <hi>shut out</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to be shut out from the <hi>Beatifical Vision,</hi>
from the glorious presence of God and Christ,
and the Saints of God.</p>
            <p>2. You must study <hi>poenam census,</hi> the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sense; for the damned are not only
shut out of Heaven, but they <hi>endure endless,
easless torments;</hi> you must meditate of the hell-worm,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65780:72"/>
and the hell-fire; the Scripture speaks
of a hell-fire, and a hell-worm, and of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the hell-fire, and the eternity of the
hell-worm, <hi>Mat. 9. 44, 46. Where the worm
never dieth, and the fire never goeth out.</hi> What
is meant by this <hi>worm?</hi> nothing else but the
gnawing of an awakened conscience. Oh
think of this <hi>hell-worm,</hi> and this <hi>hell-fire,</hi> that
you may never come to be so miserable as to
be made partakers of it. These are the first
<hi>four things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place to give you some more;
he that would thrive in all godliness, and avoid
all sin, must meditate often of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and of <hi>himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>He must</hi> meditate of God, <hi>and that is a
rare</hi> subject <hi>of meditation.</hi> David <hi>saith,</hi> Psal.
104. 34. My meditation of God shall be
sweet.</p>
            <p>1. Sometimes you must meditate of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, of his <hi>Eternity,</hi> a God from
<hi>everlasting</hi> to <hi>everlasting.</hi> You must meditate
of his <hi>unchangeableness,</hi> a God in whom there
is <hi>no shadow of turning.</hi> You must meditate of
his <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> a God that fills Heaven and
earth with his presence. Of his <hi>Essence;</hi> you
must meditate of his <hi>Omnipotence;</hi> a God that
is able to do all things, nothing is impossible
with God. You must meditate of his <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65780:73"/>
a God that knows all things, to whom
all things are naked. You must meditate of
his <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and the perfection of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
of his <hi>all-sufficiency,</hi> and his <hi>self-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency;</hi>
here is a sea of matter. What rare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
should we be, if we did often, and often
meditate on these things, instead of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on vanities and follies?</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate of the <hi>works of God;</hi>
of the work of <hi>Creation,</hi> of the glorious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of Heaven and Earth, and you must me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
of the work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
work of God in sending Jesus Christ into
the world; this meditation is that which
swallows up the Angels and Saints in Heaven.
You must meditate of the <hi>wonderful love</hi> of
God in giving Christ to become a curse for us.
You must meditate of the incomparable <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of God in giving the Son of his love, his
natural Son, to die for his adopted Sons.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate in what <hi>relation you
stand towards God,</hi> whether you stand in a
<hi>Covenant-relation</hi> to God or no? whether you
stand reconciled to God or no? whether God
be your reconciled Father in Christ, or no?</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate upon <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Christ,</hi> he is God from everlasting, he is
coequal, coessential, coeternal with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:65780:73"/>
2. You must meditate of the <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Christ,</hi> of God manifested in the flesh,
of God made man, the union of two Natures
into one Person.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate of the <hi>Offices of
Christ,</hi> of the <hi>Kingly</hi> office, the <hi>Priestly</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
the <hi>Prophetical</hi> office of Christ; but more
especially you must meditate of the <hi>Life,</hi> the
<hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> the <hi>Ascension,</hi> the
<hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the <hi>Life of Christ,</hi>
and examine, whether <hi>thy life</hi> be answerable
to his life? if thou dost not live as Christ
lived, thou shalt have no benefit in Christs
Death and Passion: thou must meditate of
Christs life, to follow the example of his
life.</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate of his <hi>Death,</hi> that
is a rare meditation to prepare you for the
Sacrament.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate <hi>what Christ suffered,</hi>
what he suffered when he was in the <hi>Garden,</hi>
when he sweat drops of blood, and prayed,
<hi>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from
me.</hi> Oh the bloody agony that Christ was
then in! And then you must meditate what
Christ suffered when he was upon the Cross,
when he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?</hi> When there was dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for three hours together upon the face
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65780:74"/>
of the earth; when there was darkness <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi>
and darkness <hi>within</hi> too; when there was
a withdrawing the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from Christ. You must meditate what
Christ suffered in <hi>Pilates</hi> Hall, when he was
<hi>whipt, scourged, buffeted.</hi> Oh what love to
Christ would this kindle in your hearts, if
you had serious meditation of these things.</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate <hi>for whom Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all these things;</hi> for us when we were his
enemies, us wretched damned creatures; not
the blessed Angels, but us, us sinful men.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate <hi>who he was that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all this,</hi> even Jesus Christ the eternal Son
of God.</p>
            <p>4. You must consider <hi>with what love he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
all this,</hi> infinite love, the height, and
depth, and length, and breadth, of the love
of God in suffering all this for us.</p>
            <p>5. You must consider <hi>what interest you have
in Christ crucified?</hi> whether Christ was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
effectually for thee, or no?</p>
            <p>3. You must study the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of
Christ.</p>
            <p>4. You must study the <hi>Ascension</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>5. You must study the <hi>Intercession</hi> of Christ;
the sitting of Christ at the right hand of God
the Father, where he lives for ever to make
Intercession for you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:65780:74"/>
3. You must meditate of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi>
and there are rare things to fill up your
thoughts.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the <hi>Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the Holy Ghost, that the Holy Ghost
is the <hi>third person</hi> in the Trinity, that the
Holy Ghost is God blessed for ever.</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate of the <hi>Office</hi> of the
<hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> it is the office of the third Person
in the Trinity to bring us into the possession
of all the <hi>Father</hi> hath decreed, and the Son
hath purchased; to make us partakers of the
decree of the Father, and the purchase of the
Son.</p>
            <p>3. You must study the Divine <hi>motions</hi> of
the holy Spirit; and we must meditate how
often we have quenched the Spirit of Christ,
how often we have resisted these motions,
how often we have imbraced these motions.</p>
            <p>4. You must meditate of the <hi>grace of the
Spirit,</hi> (this will open a door to a great deal
of excellent matter) you must meditate of the
grace of <hi>faith,</hi> the grace of <hi>repentance,</hi> the
grace of <hi>love</hi> to God, and Christ, and thy
neighbour; the grace of <hi>fear</hi> of God, and the
grace of <hi>humility;</hi> that is, you must meditate
whether your faith be a right faith, or no;
whether it be the faith of a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or
the faith of a <hi>Simon Peter;</hi> whether it be an
Historical faith only, or a justifying faith;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65780:75"/>
and whether your repentance be a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
or no; and whether your love to
Christ be a true love, or a counterfeit love.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>You must</hi> meditate of your selves.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the <hi>fourfold state</hi>
of man; man may be considered in a fourfold
state:</p>
            <p>1. Either in the state of <hi>innocency,</hi> as he
was before the fall, a <hi>spotless picture of God;</hi>
that is a rare meditation: study the happiness
of man before he fell, when he was made after
Gods own image.</p>
            <p>2. The state of man <hi>when fallen,</hi> when cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
study the cursed condition of man in
his natural condition.</p>
            <p>3. The estate of man <hi>when restored by Christ,</hi>
when regenerated, when renew'd, when made
a picture of God.</p>
            <p>4. The estate of man in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>What thou</hi> wert in Adam.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>What thou</hi> art when fallen.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>What thou</hi> art in Christ.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>What thou</hi> shalt be in Heaven.</p>
            <p>You must meditate of your <hi>sins,</hi> of your
good <hi>duties,</hi> of your <hi>evidences,</hi> and of your
<hi>comforts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of your <hi>sins,</hi> that is
a large field to walk in; you must meditate
of the sins you have committed <hi>against God,</hi> of
your sins of <hi>omission,</hi> of your sins of <hi>commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:65780:75"/>
your sins against the <hi>Law,</hi> your sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> your Sermon-sins, your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament-sins,
your spiritual sins, your fleshly
sins. You must meditate of <hi>sin</hi> to be humbled
for it, that is a rare meditation to fit you for
the Sacrament. And oh that we had hearts se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to meditate of our sins.</p>
            <p>2. You must meditate of your <hi>good duties,</hi>
that is how many good duties we omit, how
many good duties we sinfully perform; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we perform duties so as to please God in
the performance of them.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate of your <hi>Evidences
for Heaven,</hi> whether they are right or no;
whether you have gotten Tribunal-proof as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
for Heaven; whether thy Evidences
for Heaven are death-enduring; whether
they will hold out at the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>4. You must meditate of <hi>your comforts;</hi>
whether those comforts that you have, be the
<hi>consolations of the Spirit,</hi> or the delusions of
the Devil. There are many men will tell you
that they have comforts, but their comforts
are Diabolical delusions, not Divine conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>You must meditate of the <hi>frailty</hi> of your
body, the <hi>immortality</hi> of your soul, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance</hi>
you have upon God, and the <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi>
God hath you at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:65780:76"/>
1. The <hi>frailty of your body;</hi> the body of
man is made of dust, and will quickly crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to dust; it is an <hi>earthly Tabernacle</hi> that is
easily dissolved. What a rare thing will it be
to take the Scripture, and study all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
to which the life of man is compared?
to set out the <hi>shortness</hi> of it, it is compared to
<hi>grass,</hi> to <hi>hay,</hi> to <hi>stubble,</hi> to <hi>dry stubble,</hi> to a <hi>dry
leaf,</hi> to a <hi>swift post,</hi> to a <hi>vapour,</hi> to a <hi>hands-breadth;</hi>
meditate of the frailty of thy vile
body, that will quickly go down to the house
of rottenness.</p>
            <p>2. Meditate of the <hi>immortality of thy soul,</hi>
thy precious soul, which is a <hi>picture</hi> of God,
made by God, and made for God. There is no
man but hath a <hi>heavenly tapour</hi> within him,
which can never be blown out; there is no
man but he hath that within him that he <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
kill himself;</hi> there is no man but he hath
that within him that must <hi>live for ever</hi> as bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as an Angel, or as cursed as a Devil. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon the <hi>dependance you have upon God.</hi>
Oh this will keep thee <hi>humble,</hi> and make thee
<hi>comply</hi> with Gods will; thou dependest upon
God for thy <hi>being,</hi> thy <hi>well-being,</hi> thy <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
being;</hi> thou dependest upon God every
minute, thou livest by Gods upholding thee;
study the dependance thou hast upon God for
thy soul, thy body, thy wise, thy children, thy
all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65780:76"/>
4. Meditate of the <hi>advantage God hath thee
at.</hi> God hath all the world between his hands,
as the Prophet saith; and he can easily crush
us, as we do a <hi>moth;</hi> as we are <hi>creatures</hi> he
can annihilate us if he please; and as we are
<hi>sinners</hi> he can throw us into hell if he please.
Study the <hi>relations</hi> in which God hath placed
thee; study thy <hi>calling,</hi> thy <hi>company,</hi> thy
<hi>heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Study thy <hi>relations</hi> in which God hath
placed thee; there is none of us all but we
are under many relations; art thou a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
art thou a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> art thou a <hi>Father,</hi>
art thou a <hi>Master?</hi> study the duties of every
relation; study how to honour God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
relation; study to keep a good conscience
in every relation.</p>
            <p>2. Study <hi>thy calling;</hi> how to honour God
in thy calling, how to keep a good conscience
in thy calling; how to keep thy self unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the sins of thy calling, for there is
no calling but hath some <hi>sin</hi> or <hi>other</hi> attending
it. Oh meditate, that thy <hi>Shop</hi> do not destroy
thy <hi>soul;</hi> meditate to keep a good conscience
in thy Shop; that thou dost not lose in thy
<hi>own</hi> house what thou gainest in <hi>Gods</hi> house.</p>
            <p>3. Study thy <hi>company,</hi> what company to
keep, that is a great matter; for I know a
man by his <hi>company more than any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;</hi>
I mean by the company he useth to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65780:77"/>
keep. Study to keep a good conscience in all
company, study to keep thy self from the sins
of thy company.</p>
            <p>4. Study thy <hi>heart:</hi> meditate often of thine
<hi>own heart,</hi> the <hi>deceitfulness</hi> of thy heart; the
heart is deceitful above all things, it is the
greatest cheater in the world; and there are
thousands whose hearts do cozen them into
Hell; thy heart will tell thee thou lovest
God when thou dost not love him at all;
that thou art upright, when thou art an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
            <p>Study thy <hi>Thoughts,</hi> thy <hi>Affections,</hi> thy
<hi>Words,</hi> and thy <hi>Actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Meditate of <hi>thy Thoughts,</hi> the <hi>vanity</hi> of
thy thoughts, the <hi>vileness</hi> of thy thoughts, the
Hell, shall I say, that is in thy thoughts; if
all the thoughts that we think were written
upon our foreheads, how would we be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that the world should see us. Oh medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of thy <hi>covetous</hi> thoughts, of thy <hi>lustful</hi>
thoughts, thy vile and vain thoughts, to be
humbled for them.</p>
            <p>2. Meditate of thy <hi>Affections:</hi> God doth
especially look to our affections; he hates
any service that is not mixed with <hi>affection.</hi>
There are several <hi>Affections;</hi> meditate of thy
<hi>love,</hi> whether thou lovest God or the world
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65780:77"/>
most. Meditate where thy love is, whether thou
servest God out of love; whether the world
doth not lye nearer thy heart than Christ;
Meditate of thy <hi>desire,</hi> whether thou hast
larger <hi>desires</hi> after the creature than after
God; Meditate of thy <hi>joy,</hi> whether thou
dost not <hi>delight</hi> more in vanity than in Christ
Jesus; And meditate of thy <hi>sorrow,</hi> whether
thou dost not mourn more for outward losses
than for thy sins? Meditate of thy <hi>anger,</hi>
whether thy anger be rightly placed; And
meditate of thy <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>hopes,</hi> whether thou
dost, trust in God at all times.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate of your <hi>Words;</hi> Oh
what a world of sin is in our <hi>tongues!</hi> and if
we would meditate of the sins of our tongues,
Oh what a black catalogue would there be!
the <hi>tongue</hi> is a world of iniquity, <hi>set on fire of
hell,</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Meditate <hi>of thy Actions,</hi> whether thy
<hi>actions</hi> be agreeable to the will of God or no,
how thou behavest thy self towards God, and
towards thy neighbour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meditate of the</hi> sinfulness of sin, <hi>the</hi> vanity
of the world, <hi>the</hi> length <hi>of</hi> eternity, <hi>and the</hi>
excellency <hi>of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Meditate of the <hi>sinfulness of sin;</hi> sin is
the greatest evil in the world, it is a greater
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65780:78"/>
evil than banishment, than death, than Hell
it self; meditate of the intrinsecal and extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal
evil of sin.</p>
            <p>2. Meditate of the <hi>vanity of the creature:</hi>
all earthly things are vain, they are <hi>vanity of
vanity, and vexation of spirit;</hi> they are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfying
and unprofitable; what will all the
world do you good when you are sick, when
you are ready to die.</p>
            <p>3. Meditate of the <hi>length of eternity;</hi> Oh
<hi>eternity! eternity!</hi> that we studied thee more!
that we thought more of thee! Study the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between <hi>time</hi> and <hi>eternity;</hi> for Time is
nothing else but an intersection between two
Eternities; before there was <hi>time,</hi> there was
<hi>eternity;</hi> and when <hi>time</hi> shall be no more,
there shall be <hi>eternity.</hi> Time in comparison of
Eternity is no more than a Thatcht-house in
comparison of all the houses in the world;
than a drop of water in comparison of the
Ocean.</p>
            <p>4. Study the <hi>excellency of the Gospel;</hi> Oh
meditate of the glorious Gospel of Christ, and
what a <hi>priviledg</hi> it is to enjoy the Gospel; and
meditate whether thy life be answerable to
the Gospel; whether thou that hast lived so
long under the Gospel, hast lived a life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Study the <hi>Commandments</hi> of God, the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65780:78"/>
               <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God, the <hi>Promises</hi> of God, and
the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>1. Study the <hi>Commandments</hi> of God; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou keepest them, or no; to be humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for not keeping them, to labour to keep
them better.</p>
            <p>2. Study the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God, and stand
in awe of them, and fear them.</p>
            <p>3. Study the <hi>Promises</hi> of God, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the precious Promises, the <hi>freeness</hi> of the
Promises, the <hi>fulness</hi> of the Promises, the <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi>
of the Promises; there is no condition
a child of God can be in, but there is some
promise or other to comfort him; the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality</hi>
of the tender of the Promises, thy
<hi>interest</hi> in the Promises, whether the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Gospel belong to thee, or no</p>
            <p>4. Study the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God, that is,
study how to come <hi>prepared</hi> to Ordinances,
how to <hi>manage</hi> Ordinances so, that Gods
name may be honoured by them. And there
are <hi>four Ordinances</hi> that you must meditate
of.</p>
            <p>1. You must meditate of the <hi>Ordinance of
Prayer;</hi> you must study the <hi>excellency</hi> of
Prayer, the efficacy of Prayer; you must stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to get the <hi>gift</hi> of Prayer, to get the <hi>grace</hi>
of Prayer. Study how to pray in the Holy
Ghost; how to pray with faith, with ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
with repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:65780:79"/>
2. You must meditate of the <hi>Ordinance of
reading the Word;</hi> that is an Ordinance of
God, and you must study to read the Word
with reverence and godly fear, to read the
Word <hi>as Gods Word,</hi> to read the Word in a
different way than you read any other Book
whatsoever.</p>
            <p>3. You must meditate of <hi>the Ordinance of
hearing the Word;</hi> study the right art of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word; so to hear the Word as to be
<hi>transformed</hi> into what you hear; to be <hi>train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
up to Heaven by what you hear; so to
hear the Word as Gods Word, with an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
resignation of thy will to what thou
hearest.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Ordinance of the Sacrament of the
Lords-Supper;</hi> Oh meditate much of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
            <p>I have told you several Heads of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Study the <hi>errors of the times,</hi> the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of God upon the Nation, the <hi>changes</hi>
God hath made in this Nation, and the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of God.</p>
            <p>1. Study the <hi>errors of the times,</hi> labour to
get <hi>preservatives</hi> against them; it is a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and it shall be for a lamentation; there
is a great Apostacy from the Truths of Christ
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65780:79"/>
among many Professors of Religion; you shall
hardly go into a family but you shall find
some or other <hi>be-lepered</hi> with error. Here is
thy work, O Christian, to study the <hi>errors of
the times,</hi> what to do, to get antidotes and
preservatives against <hi>Anabaptism,</hi> against <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism,</hi>
against <hi>Anti-sabbatarianism,</hi> against
<hi>Anti-scripturism,</hi> against those that deny the
Divinity of Christ, and the Divinity of the
Holy Ghost; to get Spiritual armour, to be
able to resist all the errors of these times. It is
a great shame, and oh that you would be
humbled for it, that <hi>one</hi> erroneous person can
speak more for the defence of his error than
<hi>twenty Orthodox Christians</hi> are able to speak
for the Truth, for want of studying <hi>antidotes</hi>
and <hi>preservatives</hi> against the errors of the
times.</p>
            <p>2. Study the <hi>Iudgments of God</hi> that have
been for these many years upon <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland;</hi> the hand of God is gone
out against these <hi>three Nations,</hi> and the Lord
hath laid us desolate, and the sword hath
drunk a great deal of blood, and no man lays
it to heart. Now let us meditate of Gods
great <hi>Iudgments</hi> upon this land, that we may
know the meaning of Gods rod, and we may
know how to get all these Judgments sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:65780:80"/>
3. Meditate of the <hi>great changes</hi> that God
hath made in this Nation; we have been toss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from one condition to another, from one
way of Government to another. Study all
the changes and alterations that God hath
made by his permitting-Providence: Oh what
a shame is it that we should meditate no more
of Gods ways and dealings, to know the
meaning of God in all these alterations and
changes, and what the <hi>language</hi> of God is; and
what <hi>use</hi> we should make of them, and how
we should keep a <hi>good conscience,</hi> and keep
<hi>close to our Principles,</hi> and how we should
<hi>honour God</hi> under all our changes.</p>
            <p>4. You must meditate of the <hi>several passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Gods Providence towards us;</hi> there is
no man or woman here but hath had <hi>rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
of Gods Providence, either in the
place of thy <hi>dwelling,</hi> that God should pitch
thy dwelling under such a Minister; or in the
<hi>manner of thy Marriage,</hi> or the Providence of
God at such a time, under such a <hi>sickness;</hi> it
is our duty to take special notice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, in raising thee up a <hi>friend,</hi>
in helping thee at such a time. For want of
Meditation we lose all the benefit of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of Gods Providence, and God loseth all
his glory.</p>
            <p>5. You must meditate of the <hi>mercies</hi> of
God, of <hi>National</hi> mercies, <hi>Family</hi> mercies,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65780:80"/>
               <hi>Personal</hi> mercies, mercies to thy <hi>soul,</hi> mercies
to thy <hi>body, preventing</hi> mercies, <hi>following</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
what a Catalogue would here be, if you
would keep a daily account of the mercies of
God!</p>
            <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> thing is to lay down <hi>Rules and
Directions</hi> for the <hi>better practising</hi> of this <hi>most
excellent</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> duty of Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and indeed this is the chief of all:
there is no Christian but he will confess it is a
very difficult duty to dwell upon the thoughts
of Heaven, and Heavenly things. Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
is an up-hill duty; and the reason
why it is so difficult; is because it is so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
<hi>Difficilia quae pulchra,</hi> the more excellent
any duty is, the more difficult it is. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
reason why it is so difficult, is because
it is so contrary to corrupt nature; now the
more contrary any duty is to corrupt nature,
the more excellent it is. The difficulty of the
duty should not so much discourage us, as the
excellency of the duty should quicken us.
Now that I may help you against the difficulty
of this duty, I shall lay down three sorts of
rules.</p>
            <p>1. Rules for the right qualifying of the
person that is to meditate.</p>
            <p>2. Rules for the right ordering the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
upon which he is to meditate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:65780:81"/>
3. Rules for the right meditation upon
these <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. I shall lay down Rules and Directions
for the right qualifying and ordering the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that is to practise this Divine duty of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;
and for that purpose I shall give you
in these Rules.</p>
            <p>1. Convince thy soul of the absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Divine Meditation; I have shewed
it is a duty expresly commanded by God, a
duty required of all sorts of persons, of Kings,
of Generals of Armies, of young Gentlemen,
of Women, of Ministers; <hi>David, Ioshua,</hi>
young <hi>Isaac</hi> in my Text practised this duty;
and many Women, and many holy men. Let
me add, that this very duty is the life and soul
of all Christianity; you are but carcasses of
Christians if you be not acquainted with it;
it is as impossible to live without a soul, as it
is to be a good Christian without Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.
As it is impossible for a man to be
nourished by meat if he want digestion and
concoction; so it is impossible for a man to be
nourished in grace, if he neglect the duty of
Divine Meditation; for Divine Meditation
is the spiritual concoction and digestion of all
holy things, and all holy duties. As a man
without concoction, I mean without a faculty
of digestion and concoction, so is a Christian
without the practise of Divine Meditation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:65780:81"/>
2. Convince your souls (and the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you) of the great benefits and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that are obtained by a conscientious
practise of Divine Meditation; as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Divine Meditation is a mighty help to the
begetting grace, and increasing grace.</p>
            <p>1. It is a mighty help to the begetting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 119. 59. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
my ways, and turned my feet unto thy
testimonies.</hi> It was the consideration of the
evil of his ways, that made <hi>David</hi> turn his
feet to Gods Testimonies. And it is said of
<hi>Peter,</hi> Mark 14. 72. <hi>When he thought thereon,
he wept;</hi> what made <hi>Peter</hi> repent? the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of the unkindness of the sin he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against Christ. And what made the
Prodigal child come home to his father? <hi>Luk.</hi>
15. 17. <hi>When he came to himself he considered,
and said, how many hired servants of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
have bread enough, and to spare, and I
perish with hunger?</hi> It was consideration that
made the Prodigal child come home to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
he considered how much bread there
was in his fathers house, and he ready to
starve.</p>
            <p>2. Divine Meditation is a mighty help to
the love of God; for to an inconsiderate
Christian God is as a picture with a curtain
drawn over it, but consideration takes away
the curtain, unveils God to a man, and shews
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65780:82"/>
him all the beauty and excellency that is in
God; and it is like a fiery furnace to kindle
a Divine fire of love in the soul of every
Christian.</p>
            <p>3. It is a mighty help to beget in us the
<hi>fear of God;</hi> Oh did you meditate much of
the power of God, and the goodness of God,
and the forgivenesses that are in God, Oh you
would fear God for his goodness, and for his
greatness; the reason why we love God no
more, is because we think of God no more,
study God no more.</p>
            <p>4. It would be a mighty help to the <hi>love of
Christ;</hi> for Christ Jesus to an unmeditating
Christian is like a book that is sealed, like a
treasure that is lockt up; but Meditation
opens this book, unlocks this treasure; and
that man that solemnly meditates of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and love of Christ, cannot but love
Christ.</p>
            <p>5. It is a mighty help to the contempt of
the world; for the world is like gilded Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
there is a glittering excellency in it, but
meditation of the vanity of the world will
wash off all the gilt, the whorish paint, the
glittering excellency that is in the world; a
man that looks upon the world a far off, sees
nothing in it but excellency; but when you
come to meditate of the vanity of the world,
and all worldly things, meditation will
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65780:82"/>
make you contemn the world, and all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things.</p>
            <p>3. Consider the unconceivable and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
mischiefs that come upon a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
for want of Divine Meditation. What is
the reason why men go on in their sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance? it is for want of Meditation.
<hi>Ier. 8. 6. No man repenteth, because no man
saith what have I done?</hi> What is the reason
the Word of God takes no more impression
upon your hearts, and there is no more good
done by Preaching? it is because you do not
meditate upon what you hear; as a plaister
that is put to a wound, if it be pluckt off as
soon as it is put on, it will never do you good;
so if a Sermon be forgotten as soon as it is
heard, it will never profit you. And what is
the reason that the mercies of God do no
more good, that men are no more thankful
for mercies, and no more fruitful under mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?
because they do not consider their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?
come from God, <hi>Hos. 2. 8. She did not
know</hi> (that is, she did not consider) <hi>that I gave
her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her
silver and gold which they prepared for Baal.</hi>
They would not have prepared their silver
and gold for <hi>Baal,</hi> had they considered that
God gave it, but they would have served God
with it; that is the reason why you are so
proud of your mercies, and sin against God
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65780:83"/>
with your mercies, because you do not medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
that the Lord hath given you all the
mercies you have; and what is the reason
men get no more good by afflictions? because
they do not consider why God afflicts them;
what is the meaning of Gods rod, and how they
might get their afflictions sanctified: the want
of the practice of Divine Meditation is the
cause of all punishment, as well as of all sin,
<hi>Ier. 12. 11. All the whole land is made desolute,
because no man lays it to heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. If you would be rightly qualified for
Divine Meditation, labour to get a sufficient
furniture of spiritual knowledg; for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why this duty is so difficult, and why men
cannot continue long at it, is for want of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
matter to meditate upon. For as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, Meditation is a dwelling, a musing, an
abiding upon the things we know of God, or
Christ, or the Promises; it is an unlocking of
the treasure of knowledg concerning God, and
Christ, and Heaven; and he that hath not a
good stock of knowledg of Christ, or the
Promises, can never continue long to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon Christ, or the Promises; if ever
you would be a good Practitioner of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Divine Meditation, you must labour to
be instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, as
the Phrase is, <hi>Mat. 13. 42. Every Scribe which
is instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65780:83"/>
like unto a man which is a housholder, that
brings out of his treasure things old and new.</hi>
You must be acquainted with things both
new and old, and instructed in the things of
the Kingdom of God, and you must be men
in understanding, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 20. Brethren, be
not children in understanding: howbeit, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
be ye children, but in understanding be men.</hi>
A babe in understanding cannot be long in
meditation; but you must be babes in malice,
but in understanding men of ripe age. You
had need have a great deal of knowledg that
would be Practitioners to purpose of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
duty of Divine Meditatiou, you must
<hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord
Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. If ever you would be a good Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the School of Divine Meditation, you
must labour to get a serious spirit; for a slight-headed
Christian, can never be a good medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
Christian; a slight-headed and a slight-hearted
Christian, that cannot dwell upon
things, but rove from one thing to another,
cannot be a good Christian; pardon my
words, I speak them upon much deliberation:
for Religion is a serious matter, it is a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of eternity, and therefore it requires a
serious Christian; and if ever you would pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
this duty that I am preaching of, if ever
you would go up to the mount of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65780:84"/>
to converse with God there, you must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be of a serious spirit, as those were,
<hi>Luk. 1. 66. And all they that heard him, laid
it up in their hearts;</hi> they did not slight
what they heard, but laid it up in their hearts,
<hi>Luk. 2. 19. But Mary kept all these sayings,
and pondered them in her heart.</hi> Luk. 2. 51.
<hi>But his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</hi>
A good Christian is a pondering, a serious
Christian.</p>
            <p>There is a fourfold frame of spirit that
cannot stand with true Christianity, nor with
the practice of this duty that I am preaching
of, and the Lord help you against them.</p>
            <p>1. A slight frame of spirit; that man that
thinks slightly of God, will love him but
slightly, and serve him but slightly; slight
thoughts of God will make but slight impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
upon the heart, and slight impressions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the life. Slight thoughts of God will have
but slight affections to God; for if my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
be slight, my affections and my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will be slight; for my affections and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
follow my apprehension. Therefore a
slight frame of spirit is a very sad frame of
spirit.</p>
            <p>2. As there is a slight, so there is a trifling
frame of spirit; when a man thinks of the
things of Heaven as trifles; when a man tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
way a Sacrament, trifles away a Sermon,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65780:84"/>
trifles away a Prayer, as thousands of you do.
Oh it is a sad thing for a man to be serious in
trifles, and to trifle in serious things! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell which is the worst, though I think
rather the second is the worst. That is a sad
thing when a man looks upon Sabbaths, and
Sacraments, and Ministers, and Ministry, and
all the holy things of God as trifles; such an
one was <hi>Gallio,</hi> when he saw it was a matter
of Religion, he cared for none of these things,
he looked upon them as trifles. A trifling
frame of spirit cannot consist with true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>There is a watry frame of spirit;</hi> there
are some men, tell them of their sins, and they
will yield to you, and confess their sins, and
promise amendment; and there are many,
while they are at a Sermon, the Sermon takes
impression upon them, but they are of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
spirit, nothing will abide upon them. As a
man that flings a stone into the water, it will
make one circle, and another circle, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circle, a great many circles, but there is
no abiding of them, they are quickly gone;
so there are some men, their hearts will melt at
a Sermon, or a Sacrament, but they are of a
watry spirit, nothing will abide upon them.
Take a stone and fling it at a feather-bed, the
stone will make a great dint in it, but this
dint will not abide; though the feather-bed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65780:85"/>
yield to the stone, yet there is no remaining
of the impression; so, many a man is of a yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
spirit, that nothing will fix.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>A rash inconsiderate frame of spirit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stand with true Christianity;</hi> when a man
rusheth upon good duties, and upon Offices,
Church-offices, and State-offices, without any
deliberation, Meditation, or preparation; when
a man prays rashly, comes to the Sacrament
rashly, headily, hand over head, as we say;
this man is a spiritual fool, and all his holy
duties are the sacrifices of fools, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 1.
<hi>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of
God, and be more ready to hear than to give the
sacrifices of fools, for they consider not that they
do evil. Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not
thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God.</hi>
A rash spirited man that prays headily, and
comes to holy duties headily and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
this man catcheth many a fall: as a
man that runs hastily will quickly stumble;
so a man that is spiritually rash, will run into
many spiritual evils. As a man that is rash in
his calling will quickly out-run himself, so he
that is rash in holy duties will quickly run
into a thousand mischiefs; as <hi>Peter</hi> was so
rash when he said to Christ, <hi>Though all men
forsake thee, yet will not I.</hi> He was over rash,
but it cost him dear. So it was a rash act of
<hi>David,</hi> when he went to kill <hi>Nabal,</hi> and if
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65780:85"/>
               <hi>Abigail</hi> had not hindred him, he had murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. And when he gave the land to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth</hi>'s
servant, it was a rash act.</p>
            <p>Consider, I beseech you, these <hi>four Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;</hi>
these frames of spirit will never make
you good Christians, never fit you for the
practise of this rare duty of <hi>Divine Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but you must pray unto God that he would
give you a solemn and serious spirit, if ever
you would be rightly qualified to go up to
the mount of <hi>Divine Meditation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>sixth</hi> Rule is this, <hi>Labour for the love
of Heaven, and Heavenly things;</hi> the reason
why people find it so difficult to meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Heavenly things, is for want of love to
them; for if you did love Christ, I need not
perswade you to meditate of God; I need
not perswade a covetous man to meditate of
his money; a man that loves the world, you
need not perswade him to meditate of the
world; or a man that is voluptuous, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon his pleasures, his love to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
will force him to think of them; a man
that is ambitious, you need not perswade him
to think of honour and preferment, but
the love that he hath to preferment, will force
him to think of it. So, did you love God,
Christ, Heavenly things, you would be much
in the meditation of them. And the reason
why you meditate no more of them, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65780:86"/>
you love them no more, <hi>Psal. 119. 97.
Oh how do I love thy law!</hi> what then? <hi>it is
my meditation all the day.</hi> What made <hi>David</hi>
meditate all the day upon the Law of God?
because he loved it, Psal. 1. 7. <hi>But his delight
is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth
he meditate day and night.</hi> A man that is deep
in love with a woman, you need not bid him
think of that woman. Where the love is,
there the soul is. Oh, did you delight in the
things of Heaven, I need not lay down <hi>rules</hi>
to perswade you to the practise of it; the
very love would be a loadstone; love is a load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
of Meditation; and he that loves good
things will think of them: <hi>Cogitatione crebra,
cogitatione longa, cogitatione profunda;</hi> that
is, very often, very long, and very deep; a
man that is deep in love, is deep in meditation
of the party he loves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>seventh</hi> Rule, <hi>Labour to get an interest
in Heavenly things;</hi> labour by Scripture-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
to make out thy interest in Heavenly
things; what comfort can that man have of
meditating of Heaven, that doth not know
he hath a right to Heaven? what comfort can
that man have of meditating of Christ, that
doth not know that Christ is his? what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
can that man have in meditation of God,
that looks upon God as his enemy. It is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65780:86"/>
that will facilitate <hi>Divine Meditation;</hi> a
man that hath an interest in an inheritance,
will often think of it; if he hath a thousand
pound a year that is his own, he is often think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to improve it, and enjoy it; but if
he hath no title or right to it, alas he will
not think of it, what doth he care for it: It
is your interest in the things of Heaven, that
will raise your meditation of them; and as
long as you have no assurance of a title to
Heaven, you will never heartily meditate of
it; you may know it by rote and by form,
but you will never heartily meditate of it,
till you know it to be your inheritance; and
you will never heartily meditate of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
till you know you have a title to them,
that they are Promises made to you.</p>
            <p>The <hi>eighth</hi> Rule is this, <hi>Labour to get a
heart disengaged and disintangled from the
world;</hi> a man that is dead and buried in the
world, it is in vain to perswade him to go up
the mount of Meditation; a bird that is in a
<hi>Lime-twig,</hi> it is in vain to bid that bird fly, alas
poor bird she is intangled in the <hi>Lime-twig;</hi>
a man that is intangled in the <hi>lime-twigs</hi> of
the world, it is in vain to bid this man mount
up in Meditation. The love of the world is
like the plague of flies that <hi>Pharoah</hi> had in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> he could not eat a bit of meat, but the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65780:87"/>
flies got into his meat, and got into his drink;
so a man that is up to the ears in the world,
cannot pray, cannot hear a Sermon, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive the Sacrament, but this plague
of flies comes there; the thoughts of the
world is at the Sacrament with him, in Prayer
with him, on the Sabbath-day with him. The
love of the world (pray pardon me in this
expression) is just like a <hi>familiar spirit;</hi> for
indeed I cannot speak too much against it; a
Witch, that hath a familiar spirit, it will go
along with her wheresoever she goes; when
she hath once entertained it, she can never be
rid of it, but the Devil will haunt her; so
the love of the world is an invisible Devil,
and will haunt you wheresoever you go; if
you go to the Sacrament, there the Devil will
haunt you; if you go to the mount of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
the Devil and the world will be
there; if you go to pray, there the Devil
will be. And you that are in these lime-twigs,
it is in vain to preach to you the Doctrine of
<hi>Divine Meditation;</hi> and therefore let me speak
to you as God did to <hi>Moses, Put the shooes off
thy feet, for the place whereon thou stands is holy
ground:</hi> So do I say, if ever you would be
qualified for this duty of <hi>Divine Meditation,</hi>
put the shooes off your feet. You must labour
to be <hi>mortified</hi> to the world, and worldly
things; you must labour to get a Heavenly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65780:87"/>
frame of spirit; it is in vain to perswade a
worldly man to meditate of Heavenly things,
I do but beat the air; for such as the heart is,
such will the man be; if the heart be lustful,
the man will meditate of lustful things, and
act lustful things; if the heart be worldly,
the man will be worldly; such as thy heart
is, such is thy thoughts, such are thy affections,
such are thy actions; and till thy heart be
Heavenly, thou canst never be a fit practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of this duty; and therefore labour for a
Heavenly heart.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ninth</hi> Rule is this, <hi>Be not discouraged
though you find a difficulty in the beginning, of
practising this duty, but accustom thy self to it:</hi>
Custom will make perfectness; <hi>usus promptus
facit;</hi> Custom will make it an easie thing; as an
Apprentice that is newly bound to his Master,
finds his Trade very hard at first, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by custom, when he hath been a year
or two at it, then it is very easie; so at the
first you will find it very hard to meditate of
Christ, to abide and dwell long at it; but
let me assure you, accustom your selves to it,
and you will find it very easie through Gods
mercy. Have you not known many a man and
woman that hath been by the Physician pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to walk up a hill every day, at the
first he finds it very hard, he is not able to
do it, but within a <hi>month</hi> or <hi>two</hi> it begins to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65780:88"/>
be easie, and they that before could not go
up the hill without resting almost twenty
times, now they can go up without resting at
all. Oh the hill of Meditation is hard for us
to climb, that are so full of the world, so full
of vanity and folly; but if you did accustom
your selves to climb up this hill, by often do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, you would find it very easie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>tenth</hi> and last Rule is this, <hi>Do all these
things by power derived from Iesus Christ;</hi> I
do not think that it is in your power to do
these things, but I know there is power in
Christ, and Christ will give you power, as the
Apostle saith, <hi>Phil. 4. 13. I am able to do all
things through Christ, that strengtheneth me.</hi> Go
to <hi>Christ</hi> for a Heavenly heart, for a serious
spirit, to kindle in thee a love to Heavenly
things, to shew thee thy interest in Heavenly
things; for if thou didst know thy interest in
them, thou wouldest often think of them; or
if thou didst love them, thou wouldest often
think of them; or if thou hadst a Heavenly
heart, thou wouldest often think of them. Oh
therefore go to <hi>Christ,</hi> and whatsoever you
ask in the name of Christ, it shall be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I am to set down</hi> Rules for the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the materials, the subjects that we are to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65780:88"/>
meditate upon. <hi>And here I shall give you in
these</hi> four Rules.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Be sure that in the beginning, till you come
to be acquainted with this duty, you pick out
easie subjects to meditate upon;</hi> there are some
subjects that are very abstruse, and sublime, and
difficult; it is a hard matter for a weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to spend an hour in the meditation of
the ineffable and great mystery of the <hi>Trinity,</hi>
or in the meditation of the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion</hi>
of the two Natures of Christ in one Person,
or in the meditation of the Mystical Union
between Christ and a Christian. And therefore
my advice is, that in the beginning of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of this rare duty, you would pick out
<hi>easie</hi> subjects to meditate upon. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I should think that it were an easie thing
to spend an hour in meditating upon the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes</hi>
of God, to meditate of Gods <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence,</hi>
and Gods <hi>Omniscience,</hi> and Gods <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence,</hi>
and the <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> of God, the
<hi>Everlastingness</hi> of God, the <hi>Eternity</hi> of God,
the <hi>Perfections</hi> that are in God, and so to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon the <hi>works</hi> of God, the work of
<hi>Creation,</hi> to meditate what God made the
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth day; to
meditate on the goodness and mercy of God in
creating the great fabrick of Heaven and
Earth; and to meditate of the work of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
to meditate of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65780:89"/>
Divine and humane nature of Christ. I should
conceive it were an easie thing, especially to
you that love Christ, to spend a great deal of
time in meditation of the love of God in
sending Christ to become man, and of the
love of Christ, the mysery of love, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of love in God becoming man, and to
meditate of the life of Christ, and the death
of Christ; what Christ suffered in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
when he sweat drops of blood; and
what he suffered upon the Cross, when he
cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
me.</hi> Of the love of Christ that died for
us, and of the persons for whom Christ died;
for us when we were sinners: and of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and humility of Christ whilst he was
dying for us; and to meditate of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Christ, the Ascension of Christ, and
the Offices of Christ, the Kingly, Priestly, and
Prophetical Office; and to meditate of our
interest in Christ, and how we should do to
walk worthy of Christ. I conceive there are
few that truly fear God, that are so little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with spiritual knowledg, but are able
to spend an hour in meditating upon these
things. I might add another meditation, and
that is the meditation of Heaven; who is there
that hath any thing of Heaven in him, that
cannot spend an hour in meditating?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:65780:89"/>
1. Of the <hi>happiness of Heaven in general.</hi> It
is a place where we shall have such joys that
eye never saw, nor ear heard, nor ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the heart of man to conceive; it is a
place where we shall be crowned with three
Crowns, a Crown of Life, a Crown of Glory,
a Crown of Righteousness. It is an inheritance
that hath three Properties, which any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Christian may spend many years in
thinking of, An inheritance immortal, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
and that never fadeth away.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To meditate of the happiness of Heaven in
particular;</hi> as for example, who is there of such
a low form of grace, that cannot spend time
to meditate of the <hi>Beatifical Vision!</hi> what a
happiness it will be in Heaven to see God face
to face! for God is an universal Good, all
good is in God; God is all happiness, and
therefore he that is admitted to see God, sees
all happiness in God. And then to meditate
of the sight of Christ; what a rare thing will
it be for a poor soul to live for ever in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with Jesus Christ, and to behold his face!
to be with the Lord Christ! And then to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
of the company that we shall have in
Heaven, to be present with Angels and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels,
with all the Patriarchs, and with all
the holy men of God that ever have been.
And then to meditate of the place it self; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is the Paradise of God, it is the Throne
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65780:90"/>
of God, it is the first building, the highest
building, the largest building, the best buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
of the Creation of God. And then to
meditate of the perpetuity of those joys: who
cannot spend a little time in meditating of
the eternity of the joys of Heaven, not only
the perfection but the perpetuity of them!
and then to meditate of thy interest in these
joys, whether thou be'st a person qualified
to go to Heaven; and then to meditate how
thou maist do to get to be qualified to go to
that holy place, in which no unclean person
shall ever enter. That is the first Rule.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I would have you use variety in your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</hi>
I would not have you always dwell
upon one subject; the strongest stomack will
loath to eat always of one dish; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I gave you in several particulars to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon; I gave you a large field to walk
in; and I did this the rather, that so you
might have matter enough, you might not be
drawn dry for want of subjects; that you
might sometimes pick one flower, and then
another flower, and then another flower;
Variety will much delight a Christian. And
truly I would fain have this duty not be a
burden to any, but a delight to all. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I would have you meditate of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the world, and sometimes of death,
of the certainty and uncertainty of death;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65780:90"/>
and how to be fit for death. Sometimes I
would have you meditate of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
sometimes of Hell, sometimes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
sometimes of the sinfulness of sin, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the love of Christ. So I would have
you walk in the garden of Divine Meditation,
from flower to flower, that you may take the
more delight and content in. it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> Rule is this, <hi>Be sure to pick out
such subjects to meditate upon especially, which
do most of all work compunction in the heart,
that do most of all stir up holiness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
you to godliness and piety.</hi> Of this kind
is the meditation of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Christ,
the Meditation of the Life and Death, and
Resurrection and Ascension of Christ. It is a
meditation, if the Lord bless it, that will
mightily provoke you to holiness, and to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to thankfulness; so the meditation of
death is a sin-mortifying meditation; and so
the meditation of Heaven, and the day of
Judgment, these are soul-sanctifying medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
So likewise the meditation of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the world, and the sinfulness of sin; I
would have you pick out soul-awakening,
and soul-sanctifying subjects to meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
there are some men, and not a few of
those, that spend many hours in meditating
when the <hi>Iews</hi> shall be converted, and in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the time when the great slaughter
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65780:91"/>
and massacre of the <hi>two Witnesses</hi> spoken of
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. shall happen; and in studying out
the meaning of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and
the <hi>Revelations;</hi> to know whether there shall
be a Personal Reign of Christ a <hi>thousand
years</hi> upon earth, and when that shall happen.
Now you shall observe that these men are
very barren in devotion, that ravel out all
their thoughts and meditations in finding
out the <hi>secrets</hi> of God, such things as God hath
kept secret unto himself; these men are very
barren and dry in practical Divinity. I have
read a story of a man that studied the <hi>Critical
Questions of School-divinity so long, that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
to say his prayers,</hi> he could not pray. And
you shall find, that those that empty all their
strength and ability in studying speculations
and notions, are very barren in matters of
practice; and therefore my counsel is, that
you would especially pick out subjects that
will help you to be weaned from the world,
to walk humbly with God, that will kindle
a holy fire of love in your souls to Christ, and
will make you more like unto Christ, and
more <hi>conformable to his death and resurrection.</hi>
It is true, a great understanding, and an acute
wit, will make a <hi>learned</hi> man, but it is the
<hi>holy life</hi> that makes a good man.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Pick and chuse out such subjects especially
to meditate upon, that are most seasonable to thy
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65780:91"/>
condition, most suitable to thy relation,</hi> and to
that estate in which God hath set you; for
these will most affect the heart. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to give you <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> instances.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Suppose thou art a man troubled in mind,
exceedingly dejected;</hi> thou art ready to despair,
because thou art a great sinner, and thou
thinkest God will not be merciful unto thee;
and thou art afraid left Christ hath forsaken
thee: Now I would have thee pick out such
a subject to meditate upon, that will suit thy
condition. I would have thee go and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of the <hi>willingness of Christ</hi> to receive
poor sinners; not only the ability, but the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
of Christ to pardon all that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
to him; <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is not only able, but he
is willing to pardon a penitent sinner, one
that comes to him for life; he is more <hi>willing</hi> to
pardon us, than we can be to ask pardon. If
thou be'st willing to leave thy sins, Christ is
more willing to <hi>receive</hi> thee, than thou canst
be to be <hi>received;</hi> Jesus Christ would never
have took such a journey from <hi>heaven</hi> to
<hi>earth,</hi> if he had not been very willing to save
poor sinners. He is so willing to save you if
you come to him, as that he came unsent for;
the Patient did not send for the Physician, but
the Physician came of his own accord from
Heaven; <hi>The Son of man is come to seek and
save that which is lost,</hi> Mat. 18. 11. therefore
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65780:92"/>
he must needs be-willing. For a Physician to
take such a journey, and to come of his <hi>own
accord;</hi> and when he came here, and saw he
could not cure his Patient but by his <hi>own
death,</hi> the <hi>Physician dies to cure the Patient;</hi>
the Physician makes a <hi>bath,</hi> a <hi>medicine</hi> of his
own blood to cure his Patient; this did Christ:
and therefore he was very willing to receive
you; if he had not been willing to save
sinners, he could never have provided such
<hi>Gospel-Ordinances.</hi> And then again, he must
needs be willing, for he hath sworn if any
man come unto him, he will receive him: <hi>If
any man come to me, I will in no wise cast him
out.</hi> He hath engaged himself with promise;
and Christ must be a lyar, (I speak it with a
great deal of reverence) if you should come
to him and he refuse you; and when he was
here upon earth, he complains of nothing but
that men <hi>would not come unto</hi> him: <hi>You will
not come unto me that you might have life.</hi> He
never complained of the greatness, or the
naughtiness of their diseases; he cured the
diseases of all that came unto him; but all his
complaining was, that <hi>they would not come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</hi> Now did you go into your Closets,
and meditate upon these things, and pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God to bless the meditation of these
things, would not this cure your troubled
Consciences?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:65780:92"/>
2. <hi>And again, you that are troubled in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
meditate of the Promises of God;</hi> and not
only those Promises that are made, to those
that have grace, but meditate of the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that God hath made, to give grace. Study
the Promises God hath made not only to give
pardon to them that repent, but the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
God hath made to give <hi>repentance</hi> to those
that ask it. God hath not only promised to
give pardon to those that believe and repent,
but God hath promised to give repentance,
<hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. and God hath promised to give
faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. God hath not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
pardon to a broken heart, but he hath
promised to <hi>give a broken heart,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26.
Now do you go into your Closets and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of these things; they would be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
to you. And then again,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Suppose thou art in outward want, the Lord
hath blasted thy estate, thou hast lost all thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and art like</hi> Job <hi>upon the dunghill, thou
art driven it may be to beg thy bread;</hi> thou
art now a poor man not worth an half-peny;
thou wert a rich man, the Lord hath blown
upon all thou hast; this is a sad condition!
now I would have <hi>such an one spend a great
deal of time in meditating of the wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
of God</hi> towards his poor children;
consider how God feeds the fowls of the air,
and the ravens, how God provides for the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65780:93"/>
lillies. I would have him read <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. from the
<hi>24th</hi> verse to the end of that Chapter; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi>
(saith Christ) <hi>the lillies and the fowls of
the air, how God provides for them;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not distracted in thy heart, take no
thought what thou shalt eat, and what thou
shalt drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but study the Providence of
God. And then meditate of the Promises that
God hath made unto his children, to give
them whatsoever shall be necessary for them.
I would have such people as are low in estate,
read the Bible, and pick out all the Promises
that God hath made to those that want, that
fear his name; God hath promised the <hi>young
Lions shall lack and suffer hunger, but they that
fear the Lord shall want nothing that is good.
The Lord will give grace and glory, and no good
thing will he with-hold from them that walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly.
And I will never leave you nor forsake
you.</hi> Gather up all the Promises God hath
made to believers when they are poor, and
have lost all.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Art thou sick, like to lose thy husband, or
thy own own life?</hi> then pick out seasonable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
seasonable subjects; go and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of death, meditate how Christ hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away the sting of death. Meditate how
<hi>death</hi> is a gate to let us into everlasting life;
how death is an <hi>out-let</hi> to all misery, and an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
to all happiness; that death is the best
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65780:93"/>
friend that thou hast, next to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Suppose thou art to receive the Sacrament,</hi>
what must thou do a little before thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest
it? I would have you every Month
before you come to the Sacrament, spend one
hour or two in <hi>meditating of the Sacrament,</hi>
of the <hi>nature</hi> of it, the <hi>necessity</hi> of coming;
meditate <hi>whether thou be'st a worthy receiver;</hi>
and what thou must do that thou maist be a
worthy receiver; meditate of thy <hi>sins,</hi> thy
<hi>graces,</hi> thy spiritual <hi>wants.</hi> Let me commend
this to you every Sacrament, and never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it; meditate to find out thy sins, to be
humbled for them; meditate to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou hast any grace in truth, and to get
it increased; and meditate of thy spiritual
<hi>wants</hi> what they are, to get them supplied.
What a rare deal of matter is here contained
in these <hi>three</hi> particulars, to find out thy sins
by the glass of the Law? by taking the Law
of God, and examining thy life, and the Law
together, that would cost thee many an hour;
and then to get thy heart humbled for these
sins, and to confess them, and to have grace
to forsake them. And then to examine thy
<hi>Graces,</hi> whether thou hast <hi>truth</hi> of grace;
whether thy grace be meerly counterfeit, and
a shadow of grace; and if thou hast truth of
grace, how to get it increased by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and then to meditate what thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65780:94"/>
and what thou wouldest have from
Christ, and to get that supplied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing is, to set down Rules and
Directions for the right ordering of our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
upon these subjects. And here I will
lay you down Rules to direct you how to
meditate, rules to help you how to begin, and
then how to go on, and proceed to hold out
an hour in meditation, for the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in it; and then rules how you shall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
and conclude this excellent duty of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
            <p>1. Rules to teach you how to begin and
enter upon this excellent work of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and here I will lay down six rules for
your first entrance.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Be sure that you pick out a fit place to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
in;</hi> you know <hi>Isaac</hi> went out into the
field to meditate; and I have shewed you, that
this example doth not oblige us always to go
into the field, but it obligeth us to retire to
some secret place, whether it be thy Closer, or
the fields.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>When thou enterest upon this work, be sure
to get a fit time, pick out a seasonable time; Isaac</hi>
picks out the <hi>evening,</hi> and thou maist pick
out the <hi>morning</hi> if thou pleasest, (thou art
not obliged punctually to this example) or
thou maist pick out the <hi>afternoon;</hi> but thou
must be sure to pick out that time that is the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65780:94"/>
fittest time; you that are great persons have
time enough; you to whom the Lord hath
given wealth; I shewed the poor man how
he should husband his time. We have all time
enough on the <hi>Lords-day</hi> to busie our selves
with the work of Meditation, it is a <hi>Sabbath-days</hi>
work, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>You must be sure of a fit subject, you must
not have your subject to seek,</hi> when you begin
to meditate; meditate of a soul-awakening, a
soul-refreshing subject.</p>
            <p>4. When you have your <hi>place</hi> and your
<hi>time,</hi> and your <hi>subject,</hi> (these three are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the beginning of this work) then I
would advise you to set your selves as in Gods
presence; though no eye sees you, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the great God sees you, and especially
when you are meditating of Divine things;
for you must know, that meditation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things is a conversing with God. When
you meditate of Heaven, you converse with
Heaven, and the glory of Heaven, it is the
souls transmigration to Heaven, it is the souls
transfiguration; and therefore I would have
you set your selves as in Gods presence; and
this will overawe you, and make you serious;
the consideration of the <hi>presence</hi> of God, will
prepare you for every holy duty; &amp; so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
for this holy duty; it is a rare preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
against all sin; as <hi>Ioseph</hi> said to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65780:95"/>
               <hi>How can I do this evil and sin against my
God?</hi> though no body saw him, yet he knew
God saw him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 10. And it is a rare
encouragement to all godliness, Psal. 119. 168.
<hi>I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies,</hi>
(why so?) <hi>for all my ways be before thee.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whensoever you go into your Orchards,
or Gardens, or your Closets, to set apart an
hour in Divine Meditation, I would have you
do as <hi>David</hi> did, Psal. 16. 8. <hi>I have set the
Lord always before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. I would have you always <hi>begin with
prayer;</hi> now I do not mean to begin with a
solemn set long prayer, but I would have you
begin with a short ejaculation; I would have
you pray unto God to enlighten your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
to quicken your devotion, to warm
your affections, and so to bless that hour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that by the meditation of holy things
you may be made more holy, you may have
your lusts more mortified, and your graces
more increased, you may be the more morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the world, and the vanity of it, and
lifted up to Heaven, and the things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And therefore in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the same
word that signifies to <hi>meditate,</hi> signifies to
<hi>pray,</hi> and as it is said in my Text, <hi>Isaac
went out to meditate,</hi> you shall find it in the
Margent, <hi>Isaac went out to pray.</hi> Meditation
must always be joined with Prayer. <hi>Isaac</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:65780:95"/>
went out to pray and meditate, to meditate
and pray; saith <hi>Bernard, Meditation without
prayer, is barren and unfruitful.</hi> Therefore I
I would have you begin with a short prayer.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>I would have you keep your hearts with
all keeping,</hi> Prov. 4. 23. have a care in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of thy heart, pray unto God to keep
out inward company. You know I told you
of a twofold company, of an outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and inward company; pray unto God
not only to keep out outward company, but
inward company; that is, to keep out vain,
and worldly, and distracting thoughts. A man
may easily drive out outward company, he
may easily be alone; but it it a hard matter to
drive away inward company, thy vain world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and distracting thoughts. I would have you
say to the world when you go up to meditate
of Heaven, or of Grace, or of God, as Christ
said to his Disciples, <hi>Mat. 26. 36. Sit you
here while I go yonder and pray.</hi> So I would
have you say to the world and all worldly
thoughts, Tarry you here while I go into my
Closet to meditate of the things of God, and
Heaven, to meet with God in Heavenly
things. And I would have you say as <hi>Abraham</hi>
did to his servants, <hi>Gen. 22. 5. He said unto
the young men, abide you here with the asse,
and I and the lad will go yonder and worship.</hi>
Tarry you here below while I go up to the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65780:96"/>
Mount of God. Now I know this is a hard
matter, I am not ignorant of it, to drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
this <hi>plague of flies</hi> that pester our best
duties; and therefore we must do as the
Priest did to King <hi>Vzziah,</hi> he would needs
offer Incense, and the Priest hindred him, <hi>and
the Lord plagued Vzziah, and the leprosie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in his forehead, and the Priest came
and thrust him out of the Temple.</hi> So I would
have you do when you go to your Closets to
meditate, your vain thoughts will croud into
the Temple of your hearts; I would have
you do as these Priest did, <hi>thrust out these
vain thoughts out of the temple of your hearts,</hi>
or rather pray unto God to do it; for alas, it
is above our power to get free from distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoughts in this duty; pray unto the Lord,
who is the heart-maker, that he would be
the heart-preparer; for when you go to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
God looks especially at your hearts,
and if your hearts be full fraught with lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
vain, worldly, carnal, covetous thoughts,
he scorns all your service. Now do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
me, I mean if you willingly yield to
this; if you strive against it, God will accept
of it; let it be thy work, (that is my rule) to
<hi>keep thy heart with all keeping,</hi> when thou
beginnest this work. And labour to get thy
heart disengaged and disintangled from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. So much for the beginning, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:65780:96"/>
of the <hi>six Rules</hi> to direct you in the entrance
upon this work.</p>
            <p>2. I will lay down <hi>Rules</hi> for the better
proceeding in this work; for this you must
know, there are <hi>two faculties of the soul</hi> that
must always be set on work in the practice of
<hi>Divine Meditation;</hi> the one is the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
the other is the heart and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for <hi>Divine Meditation</hi> is not only an
act of the <hi>head,</hi> but of the <hi>heart;</hi> and true
Meditation must not only be intellectual and
notional, but practical and affectionative. The
work of the Understanding is to blow up and
increase, to kindle and inflame the love of God
and Christ in the heart; the Understanding,
to the heart and affections must be as the
nurse to the child, as the nurse cuts the meat
and, many times chews it, and prepares it for
the child to eat, so doth the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Divine Truths, it prepares them for
the affections; and the heart to close with
them, to eat them, and digest them, and to
turn them into a holy conversation. These
are the two faculties we must set on work; and
you never meditate aright, unless the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be raised as well as the understanding; and
therefore both <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>head</hi> are the parts
that must be exercised in the practice of the
duty of <hi>Divine Meditation.</hi> Now the work
of the head or understanding is serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65780:97"/>
of the Truths we come to meditate
upon; the work of the heart is increase of
devotion and holiness by these Meditations.
Now I will speak to both, I will give you
<hi>Rules</hi> to help the intellectual part, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Divine things, and <hi>Rules</hi> to
help the affectionative part.</p>
            <p>1. I will give you Rules for the helping
the understanding, to chew and prepare the
things you meditate upon, for the <hi>heart</hi> and
<hi>affections.</hi> Now here I must tell you I shall be
somewhat difficult and hard to be understood,
this is the knottiest and difficultest part of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;
and therefore learned men that
write of this subject, that labour to teach the
art of <hi>Divine Meditation,</hi> do give in nine
<hi>common-place-heads,</hi> as so many several ways
of the enlarging the understanding in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Truths that they meditate
upon.</p>
            <p>1. They would have you describe the
thing you meditate upon.</p>
            <p>2. They would have you divide and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
the thing you meditate upon.</p>
            <p>3. They would have you consider the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the thing you meditate upon.</p>
            <p>4. The fruits and effects.</p>
            <p>5. The adjuncts, qualities and properties.</p>
            <p>6. The opposites and the contraries to it.</p>
            <p>7. The comparisons to which it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:65780:97"/>
8. The titles that are given to the thing of
which you meditate.</p>
            <p>9. All the Scripture-testimonies that may
be brought concerning the thing you are to
meditate upon.</p>
            <p>Now there are nine <hi>common-place-heads,</hi> and
these I fear are very difficult; but that I might
help you a little, I will give you an example,
I will go over these <hi>Logical heads:</hi> only I will
<hi>preface</hi> thus much, That it is not the intent of
these learned men that we should be over-cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in prosecuting all these <hi>Logical heads,</hi> for
the end of Meditation is not to practise <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
but to kindle devotion; and there are
many subjects that will not admit of all these
<hi>nine.</hi> When I meditate of God, I cannot shew
any cause of God, and I cannot make any
comparison to compare God to; but the
meaning of those learned men is this, that we
should not rack and torture our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to pursue all these heads of reasons, but
we should pick out so many of them as are
most suitable to the <hi>subjects</hi> we are meditating
upon. As for example, Suppose I would go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Closet, and meditate of the sinfulness
of sin, then I would go over all these nine
<hi>heads;</hi> and by going over them, you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the use of them. I would meditate
of the <hi>sinfulness of sin,</hi> that so I might get my
heart to hate it more, that so I might study
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65780:98"/>
to be more mortified to it, to mourn for it.
Now for this purpose, that I might enlarge my
intellectual part of consideration,</p>
            <p>1. I will begin with the <hi>description of sin,</hi>
and I will say thus to my soul, when I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone:
Oh my soul! why shouldest not thou
hate and abhor sin? is not sin the breach of
the holy law of God? and doth it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deserve eternal damnation? is not sin a
walking contrary unto God? and certainly
that man that walks contrary to God, walks
contrary to Heaven, and contrary to his own
happiness. Is not sin most opposite to the
greatest good, and therefore must needs be
the greatest evil? and why then should not
sin have the greatest sorrow? why should
not I hate sin above all things, if it be the
greatest evil?</p>
            <p>2. I would proceed to the <hi>distribution of
sin;</hi> and thus I would say to my soul: Oh my
soul! how art thou be-leper'd with sin! how art
thou all over bespread with iniquity! thou
art guilty of the first sin that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the world, of <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating the
forbidden fruit; that sin was jusdy thine by
imputation: <hi>For in him</hi> (saith the Apostle)
<hi>we all sinned,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. And thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be free from the guilt of the imputation
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, till thou be by faith made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of the <hi>imputation of Christs righteousness.</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:65780:98"/>
Thou art guilty, Oh my soul, not only of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s sin by <hi>imputation,</hi> but of <hi>Original</hi> sin
by <hi>propagation;</hi> thou wert conceived in sin,
and thou art born in iniquity; thou hast a
nature which thou carriest about with thee,
which makes thee prone to all sin, and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to all good; thou hast a nature that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files
all thy holy duties, and thou art guilty
of many actual transgressions, of heart-sins,
of lip-sins, of life-sins, of sins of omission;
how many good duties have I omitted! of
sins of commission, how many evil actions
have I committed! and thou art guilty of
sins against the <hi>Law,</hi> and sins against the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;</hi>
(then would I reckon up soms sins) and
then thou art guilty of fleshly, and outward,
and visible sins; and thou art especially, Oh
my soul, guilty of inward, spiritual and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
sins, of heart-adultery, though not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
adultery; of heart-murder, of heart-idolatry,
of pride, vain-glory, hypocrisie,
self-seeking. There is the second head, the
division of sin.</p>
            <p>3. I would come to the <hi>third head,</hi> and
consider the original and cause of sin; and I
would say thus: Oh my soul! surely God is
not the author of all these sins that I am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of; it is the greatest blasphemy in the
world to charge God with our sins; God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the author of that of which he is the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65780:99"/>
punisher. <hi>Iudas</hi> did not betray Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was determined he should do it, but
it was out of <hi>covetousness;</hi> and the brethren
of <hi>Iudah</hi> did not fell <hi>Ioseph</hi> because it was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed</hi>
they should do it, but out of envy. Oh!
it is my wicked heart that is the root of all
my sin; it is not the <hi>Devil</hi> that is the original
of my sin, for the <hi>Devil</hi> cannot force me to
sin; the <hi>Devil</hi> perswades me to sin, tempts me
to sin, but he cannot compel me to sin; sin
came into the world by <hi>Adam</hi>'s disobedience,
Rom. 5. 12. <hi>By one man sin came into the
world.</hi> And my wicked heart is the root of all
my sin: Oh my soul! why shouldest not
thou abhor thy self because of thy sin.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>I would have you consider the cursed fruits
and effects of sin;</hi> and I would say thus: Oh
my soul! be thou humbled for thy sins; Oh
lye in the dust because of thy sin; for it is sin
that is the cause of all evil, both <hi>Temporal,
Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal;</hi> sin brings spiritual, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and eternal <hi>curses;</hi> it was sin put <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilishness</hi>
into the <hi>Angels,</hi> and made the Angels
in Heaven to become Devils in Hell; it was sin
that brought the <hi>flood</hi> upon the old world;
it was sin that turned Heaven into Hell, and
made God rain down fire and brimstone upon
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah;</hi> it is sin that kindles the
<hi>fire</hi> in Hell; the fire of Hell would go out
were it not for <hi>sin;</hi> sin is worse than <hi>Hell,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:65780:99"/>
because it is the cause of <hi>Hell;</hi> and I would
meditate thus: Surely sin is more opposite to
God than Hell, for God is the author of Hell,
God made Hell for sinners, but God is not
the author of sin; and therefore, Oh my soul,
do thou hate sin more than affliction, nay
more than Hell it self.</p>
            <p>5. I would proceed to consider the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts
and properties of sin in general, and
of my sin in particular; and I would thus
meditate upon this <hi>common-place head:</hi> Oh
that the Lord would work in my heart a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abhorrency of all sin! Oh that sin might
be more loathed; for sin is of a defiling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of a destructive nature; sin is of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing
nature, it defiles my person, it defiles
my Sacraments, my Prayers, the Sermons I
hear; it makes me like a <hi>dog,</hi> like a <hi>swine,</hi> nay
it makes me like a <hi>Devil; I have chosen
twelve, and one of you is a Devil.</hi> Sin makes
you nasty and loathsome in Gods sight; sin
defiles your civil actions, <hi>The plowing of a
wicked man is sin;</hi> sin defiles the land in
which you live, <hi>Ezek. 14. The land is defiled
by your idolatry;</hi> sin defiles the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Oh my soul! wilt thou make a sport of
that which defiles the whole Creation? And
then I would say, sin is of a destructive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it destroys the body, it destroys the
soul for evermore. And then I would consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65780:100"/>
the <hi>properties</hi> of my sin in particular; I
would say thus: Oh my soul! how great is
thy guilt! I have sinned not only against God,
but against light; my sins have bloody aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
I have sinned against the heart-blood-mercy
of Jesus Christ. I have sinned against
many Sacrament-vows that I have made; I
have sinned against knowledg, against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>6. I would consider the opposites to the
thing I meditate on; what is opposite to sin?
why Grace; Then I would meditate of the
excellency of Grace; and I would say, Oh
my soul! how beautiful is that soul that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with Grace! sin makes me like a Devil,
sin stamps the Devils image upon my soul, but
Grace makes me Gods picture; Grace is the
portraiture of the Holy Ghost; Grace enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the soul, it legitimates the soul, it elevates
the soul. Oh the beauty of a soul enriched
with grace! Oh the Heavenly excellency of
a gracious soul! Now by how much Grace is
more excellent, by so much is sin more odious,
for sin destroys Grace.</p>
            <p>7. I would consider the comparisons to
which sin is compared; and I would say thus,
Oh my soul! wilt thou not abhor sin? sin is
compared to bruises, sores, putrefaction, a
leprosie, a plague, the excrements of a man.
And it is called in Scripture an <hi>abominable
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65780:100"/>
thing;</hi> it is compared to the filth under a
mans nails, and to the putrefactions of sores;
and the dung, the excrements of man; and
wilt thou love that which is loathsom to God?
shall sin be so abominable in the sight of God,
and shall it not be so in my sight?</p>
            <p>8. I would consider the titles that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to sin; and I would say thus, Sin is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a <hi>robbing of God,</hi> Mal. 3. shall I rob God
of his glory by my sin? Oh! God forbid. Sin
is called an <hi>injury</hi> to God; shall I injure my
Saviour by my sins? It is called a <hi>striking tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the name of God,</hi> so the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
signifies, which we translate to swear; it is
a <hi>Deicidium,</hi> the killing, the murdering of
God; and Oh my soul! wilt thou do as much
as in thee lies to murder thy Saviour, to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Christ afresh by thy sins?</p>
            <p>9. I would consider all that the Scripture
saith concerning sin; I would consider the
wrath of God against sin, I would consider all
the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of God against sin; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
I would study what Christ suffered to
free us from sin, and I would behold the <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi>
of sin upon Christ's Cross; sin made
Christ sweat drops of blood, and shall it not
make me shed tears? Sin made Christ cry, <hi>My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> and
shall it not make me cry out, <hi>Oh miserable
man that I am! who shall deliver me from this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65780:101"/>
body of sin?</hi> And then I would consider what
hope there is of pardon through Christ, and
what promises there are made of pardon.</p>
            <p>Thus I have cut out a pattern, and gone
over these <hi>nine heads;</hi> and you will say here is
work for many hours to that Christian that is
of a mean capacity, that is able in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to go over these; here you see what a
rich furniture you have by going over these
<hi>Logical</hi> helps; and as I have done concerning
sin, so may you do concerning the Sacrament;
and when you meditate of Heaven, you may
go over these heads, and consider the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Heaven, and the distribution of it,
and the causes, and the effects, and the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
and the comparisons, and this will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
you with <hi>intellectual</hi> matter. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these <hi>Logical heads</hi> are somewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
I will give you some <hi>plainer rules,</hi> for
helping ordinary Christians, those that are
babes in the school of Grace, and are not able
to enlarge their thoughts upon any subject; I
will give you briefly five easie Rules to
help you to enlarge your thoughts upon
what <hi>subjects</hi> you chuse to meditate on.</p>
            <p>1. You must consider what the Scripture
saith of the <hi>subject</hi> you would spend an hour
in meditation about; as for example, would
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65780:101"/>
you meditate of the <hi>Promises?</hi> do you want
matter to furnish you? take the Bible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what the Scripture saith concerning the
preciousness of the Promises, the freeness, the
riches, the infallibleness of the Promises, the
universality of the tender of the Promises, the
variety of the Promises; consider what the
Scripture saith of Promises to Grace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of Grace; consider all the many rare and
admirable Promises that are in the Word of
God, and pick out some choice of them to
meditate on. So likewise would you meditate
of the Sacrament? take your Bible and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what you have read concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
the nature of it, and the excellency
of it, the excellency of the Feast, and the end
why God hath appointed the Sacrament, and
the way and means by which you may come
to be prepared, and made fit to be worthy,
receivers; and consider the danger of coming
unworthily, and the happiness of coming
worthily. But if this be too hard, I will give
you an easie help.</p>
            <p>2. Consider what Sermons you have heard
of that subject you would meditate upon, and
labour to recollect the heads of any Sermon
you have heard, and make use of them to
help you to enlarge your thoughts in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As for example, I have made many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65780:102"/>
of late upon the Promises, any of those
Sermons would furnish you with matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for Meditation upon the Promises; I
have made many Sermons upon the week-day
to set out the happiness of Heaven; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sermons I have preached lately of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Attributes of God, which is a rare sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to meditate upon. If you would meditate
of the Attributes of God, you must labour to
recollect what you have heard of this <hi>subject,</hi>
and that would furnish you with matter. So
would you meditate of Heaven, or of any
thing that you find too hard to enlarge your
selves about? take the help of Sermons that
you have heard; or if that be too hard for
you, let me propound a third.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> way that is easier than both
these: Take a book that treats of the <hi>subject</hi>
you would meditate upon; there is no
<hi>Divine Subject</hi> but there is some book or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that doth treat of it; there are many
books that treat of the <hi>four last things,</hi> which
are four rare materials of Meditation, the
<hi>Quatuor Novissima,</hi> Death and Hell, and the
day of Judgment and Heaven; and there are
many books that treat of the preciousness of
the Promises, the sinfulness of sin, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of Christ, and the Sacrament. Now if
thou findest thou art barren in Meditation,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65780:102"/>
and knowest not how to spend an hour in
meditating upon any of these Subjects, take
one of these books before thee. Now I do not
mean you should read these books, but only
pick out some choice things, and then muse
and meditate what these books will suggest
unto you.</p>
            <p>4. Let me add another Rule, <hi>Be sure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in your meditation, to join application; be
sure to join examination, and application, and
contemplation, and consideration;</hi> this is a <hi>rule</hi>
of great concernment to the weakest of
Christians. As for example, would you medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
of sin, of the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of sin? be sure to
draw down your meditation to <hi>application,</hi>
make application to thy own soul, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whether thy sins are pardoned; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider the grievousness of sin in general,
for general contemplation of things, though
never so excellent, will not work upon the
soul; I hardly ever heard of a man that was
converted by <hi>Generals;</hi> it is the <hi>particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi>
that works upon the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
Nathan,</hi> as long as he told <hi>David</hi> of
his sin in a <hi>Parabolical</hi> way, <hi>David</hi> was not
wrought upon; he was fain at last to tell him,
<hi>Thou art the man;</hi> then <hi>David</hi> confesseth his
sin; you shall seldom hear a general Sermon
do good, it is the <hi>particular application</hi> that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65780:103"/>
works upon peoples hearts. And therefore in
all your exercise of <hi>Divine Meditation,</hi> be
sure to draw down things to <hi>particulars:</hi> As
for example, wouldst thou meditate of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi>
apply it to thy soul, and ask thy soul,
Am I fit and meet to go to that place? have I
a Heavenly disposition? have I Heavenly
qualifications? am I one of those whose
<hi>names</hi> are written in Heaven? is that my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance?
is that my house? This will excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
affect you, it will make your Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be very useful, and very powerful;
and so when you meditate of <hi>death,</hi> still draw
down to examination, Am I fit for death?
will death be an happy hour to me? am I one
of those that shall enjoy God after death?</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> Rule is this, <hi>Be sure always in your
meditation to consider the means how to obtain
what you meditate upon, if it be good; and the
means to shun it, if it be evil.</hi> The means to get
what you meditate upon, if it be good: if you
meditate of Heaven, then consider the means
how to enjoy that blessed inheritance; and
if you meditate of the Promises, consider how
you shall do that by which you may be heirs
of all these Promises; and on the contrary, if
you meditate of evil things, what means there
are to be used to shun these evil things; if
you would meditate of sin, what must I do to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65780:103"/>
avoid sin, that I may be unpoluted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled,
that I may get my sins pardoned, and
my soul purged; and when you meditate of
Hell, what shall I do to escape those ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
burnings? these are the five helps to
weak Christians.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>You to whom the Lord hath given under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
I would have you fly to those nine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place-heads:</hi>
if you be able study the
cause of the thing you meditate upon, the
<hi>effects</hi> and the <hi>properties,</hi> and the <hi>distribution</hi>
and <hi>description, &amp;c.</hi> and this I am sure will
furnish you with rare matter, with abundance
of materials of meditation; that man that is
pleased to put these things in practice, will
find his heart will never want matter to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
upon.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Intellectual part</hi> of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is the knotty and difficult part.</p>
            <p>2. Now I come to that which is the easiest
part of Meditation, I mean easie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
but not easie to practice; I come to
that which is the best part of Meditation, the
very life and soul of Meditation, and that is
to help you to get your affections warmed
and heated by the things you meditate upon;
for the work of the understanding is nothing
else but to be as a Divine <hi>pair of bellows,</hi> to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65780:104"/>
kindle and inflame the heart and affections;
the work of the understanding is to chew and
prepare <hi>matter,</hi> to help the affections. Now
then I am to give you some <hi>directions and
helps</hi> for the affectionative part, to get your
affections warmed and heated, so as to stir up
<hi>piety</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> in your souls: Now for the
working upon your affections, learned men
that write upon this <hi>subject,</hi> propound <hi>six
common-place-heads,</hi> as so many ways to <hi>raise
the affections,</hi> and to get them so excited as to
increase grace and holiness in the soul.</p>
            <p>1. You must labour to get a relish and a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the things you meditate upon.</p>
            <p>2. You must complain before God for the want
of that relish.</p>
            <p>3. You must wish you had a supply of what
you want of this relish and taste of the things
you meditate on.</p>
            <p>4. You must confess your inability, as of your
selves to do this.</p>
            <p>5. You must petition to God for help.</p>
            <p>6. You must confidently believe God will help
you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65780:104"/>
Here are <hi>six helps</hi> for the <hi>affectionative</hi> part
of Meditation; now that you may know the
use of these <hi>helps,</hi> I shall crave leave to go
over them all by way of <hi>instance;</hi> I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you an <hi>instance</hi> concerning the <hi>sinfulness
of sin,</hi> I went over <hi>nine common-place heads,</hi>
and shewed you how you should enlarge in
every particular about the <hi>sinfulness of sin;</hi>
now I will proceed further in this <hi>instance,</hi>
and shew you how you should make use of
these <hi>Particulars,</hi> to get your <hi>affections raised</hi>
and warmed, and stirred up to more holiness.
After that I have traversed all the <hi>heads of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and have considered the description, the
distribution, cause and effects of <hi>sin,</hi> now I
come to the work of the <hi>affections.</hi> And
here,</p>
            <p>1. I will labour to get my heart affected
with the bitterness of sin, I will labour to
taste the bitterness of it, and to get my heart
in a mourning frame; and I will thus say to
my self, Oh my soul, is <hi>sin</hi> so odious to God,
that no sacrifice but the sacrifice of the blood
of God can appease Gods wrath? and shall it
not be odious to me? was <hi>sin</hi> so displeasing
unto God, and so defiling to the soul, that no
bath but a <hi>bath of Christs blood</hi> can wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the stain of it? and shall I make a mock
of that <hi>sin</hi> that cost the blood of Christ? was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65780:105"/>
               <hi>sin</hi> a burden to Christ? and shall it not be a
burden to me? Thus I would reason with my
self, Did sin make Christ shed <hi>drops of blood,</hi>
and shall it not make me shed a <hi>few tears?</hi>
Did Christ cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me,</hi> for our sins, I mean for
our sins he took upon him? and shall I make a
sport of sin? shall I make a mock of sin? Doth
<hi>David</hi> complain, <hi>That his sins was a burden
too heavy for him to bear.</hi> And doth <hi>Paul</hi> cry
out, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am! who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from this body of sin?</hi> And shall not
sin be bitter to me? shall not I mourn that I
have sinned against so gracious a God, so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
a Redeemer, so holy a Sanctifier?</p>
            <p>2. I would proceed to the second, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to complain of the hardness of my heart,
and of my unaffectedness with the sins I am
guilty of; and I would thus say to my soul,
Oh my soul! how is it that thou canst mourn
for any outward loss, if thou losest but a child,
though it may be thou hast half a score? if
thou losest but one of them, thou canst mourn
immoderately; if thou losest thy wife, thy
husband, any part of thy estate, thou canst
mourn too much; but thou hast not one tear
for thy sins? how is it, Oh my soul, that thou
shouldest be thus hard-hearted, and unaffected
with thy sins? Is not sin <hi>Deicidium?</hi> is not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65780:105"/>
sin a murdering of God in as much as in us
lies; is not sin <hi>animaecidium,</hi> that which slays
the soul? is not sin a <hi>dethroning</hi> of God, a
<hi>robbing</hi> of God, an <hi>injuring</hi> of God? how is
it then that I am no more affected with my
sin? how is it that after so many Sermons, so
many Sacraments, so many years being in the
School of Christ, after so many mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from God, so many afflictions the Lord
hath inflicted upon me, yet my heart should
be so hard, and so flinty, and so stony? I can
easily hate my enemy too too soon, which I
should not do, but Sin that is my greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
I cannot hate that, which I should hate
most of all! I must love my outward enemy,
but God bids me hate my Sin; God doth not
bid me love the Devil, or the works of the
Devil; I can hate that which I should love,
but I cannot hate that which I should hate, I
cannot hate my Sin.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>I would proceed to stir up my affections to
a passionate wish;</hi> and I would say to my soul
thus, Oh that my heart were more soft; Oh
that I could mourn with a godly mourning,
not with a legal mourning, but with a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that is out of love to God. Oh that I
could mourn with repentance unto life, with
a Gospel-sorrow for all my sins of omission,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65780:106"/>
commission, my Sacrament-sins, my family-sins,
my Closet-sins, the sins of my youth, the sins
of my riper age, for all my unkindness against
my God: Oh that my head were waters, and
mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I could
mourn day and night for my sins, and the sins
of the times, and the sins of the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I live: Oh that rivers of tears would run
down my eyes, because I have sinned against
my God! Thus would I wish, and passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
express my self, that so I might get my
heart raised up: Oh that the Lord would
pour down the spirit of mourning upon me.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>I would make an humble confession of my
own inability, to mourn;</hi> and I would say thus,
O Lord! thou knowest it is not in man to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his own ways, it is not in man to guide
his own steps; I know, Oh Lord, that I am
not able of my self to think a good thought;
it is easier for me to cleave a rock in pieces,
than to cleave my rocky heart by my own
strength; there must be an <hi>Almighty power</hi> to
get my heart to be soft; for my heart, Oh
Lord, is harder than the nether milstone, and
I cannot soften it; I would mourn that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mourn, that I have not power; I can do
nothing without power derived from Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:65780:106"/>
5. <hi>I would go to supplication after confession,
and I would petition to God for strength;</hi> and
I would say, Oh Lord! thou that hast promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to take away my heart of stone, and give
me a heart of flesh; hast thou not promised
to work all my works in me, and for me?
hast thou not promised <hi>to subdue my iniquities?
Micah</hi> 7. 19. hast thou not promised that
<hi>Sin shall not have dominion over me?</hi> this is
the promise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. now Lord, thou hast
promised these things, I beseech thee perform
these Promises; thou God of Truth, make
good thy word, <hi>take away my heart of stone,</hi>
and give me to mourn for my great abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and <hi>work this work in me and for me;</hi>
and subdue my iniquities, and let not Sin have
dominion over me; rather give me over to the
dominion of men: though I would not be a
slave to men, yet I had rather be a slave to all
the men in the world, yea a slave to the
<hi>Turk,</hi> than a slave to the <hi>Devil;</hi> rather be a
<hi>Galley-slave</hi> than a <hi>Devils-slave;</hi> of all slavery,
Lord, deliver me from soul-slavery. And thus
I would supplicate and petition; and when I
have done all this,</p>
            <p>6. I would encourage my self by faith in a
confident hope and trust in God, that the Lord
will hear my prayer, and give me strength
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65780:107"/>
against my corruptions, and supply me with
help in all my necessities; and I would say
thus, Oh Lord, thou hast promised that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
I ask in the name of Christ, shall be
granted unto me; blessed God! I ask this day
in the name of Christ pardon of Sin, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
against Sin, and a broken heart for Sin, and
from Sin; I ask repentance unto Salvation;
thou hast promised to give it, I believe thou
wilt give it; <hi>I believe, Lord, help my unbelief.</hi>
And then I would say to my soul, <hi>why art thou
disquieted, Oh my soul?</hi> why art thou cast down?
why art thou troubled? still trust in God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon God, he is my help, he is my joy,
in him will I put my trust.</p>
            <p>Thus I have gone over these <hi>Six Heads,</hi> I
have given you one instance. Now I would
have you know, whatsoever I have said of Sin,
I can go over of any <hi>Subject</hi> whatsoever; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I would meditate of <hi>Heaven,</hi> after I have
meditated of the <hi>joys</hi> and <hi>excellencies</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and all those particulars in the <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
part; then, to work upon my affections, I
would labour to get my heart affected with
the <hi>joys</hi> of Heaven, and then I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that I am no more affected with those
joys, and with the Beatifical Vision, and the
rare company that I shall there enjoys; and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65780:107"/>
then I would passionately wish, Oh that my
heart were more heavenly; Oh that I could
taste more of those everlasting joys, that the
Lord would come down and heavenlize me,
and then I would confess my inability of my
self, and I would supplicate for help, and I
would confidently believe that the Lord will
send down heaven into my heart, and the joys
of it, before I come thither.</p>
            <p>That which I say of the <hi>sinfulness of sin,</hi> you
may make use of in all other <hi>Subjects</hi> that you
meditate upon. So much for the <hi>Rules and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi>
for the better helping you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
and go on in the duty of Meditation.</p>
            <p>3. Now there remains only some Rules for
the conclusion of all. When thou hast begun
and entred upon this duty, and made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in it, when thou comest to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
shut up thy Meditation of Divine
things with thankfulness, with resolution, and
with recommendation of thy soul to God.</p>
            <p>1. I say, <hi>conclude with thankefulness;</hi> lift up
thy heart to God, and bless his name that
hath enlarged thy soul, and enabled thee to
spend an hour in meditation of holy things;
especially if you find your hearts affected
with what you meditate upon, if you have
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65780:108"/>
gotten from the <hi>intellectual</hi> part into the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionative;
if you have gotten your souls
raised up. As for example, if you have been
meditating of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and you find a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
frame</hi> wrought in you, you find a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be with the Lord, and you find some
assurance that your name is written there, and
some manifestations of God to your souls, Oh
then close up all with an Hallelujah, <hi>Blessed
be the Lord for the assistance of this hour.</hi> So
likewise, have you been meditating of Sin,
and find at the conclusion, that thy heart is
somewhat soft, and doth begin to mourn for
thy Sin, and thou art troubled that thou hast
offended thy God; and the Lord hath
wrought in thee some confidence, some spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
assurance that thy Sins shall be mortified,
and that the Lord will keep thee that thy <hi>sin
shall not have dominion over thee?</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with a <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> lift up thy heart, and
bless the Lord for his assistance. I might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
add, when thou hast been meditating on
the <hi>Promises,</hi> or of <hi>Death,</hi> whatsoever the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
thou art meditating upon is, if the Lord
hath wrought thee to have a heart above the
<hi>fear of death,</hi> by meditating of death, and
thou hast learned to be willing and ready to
die; Oh bless the Lord for his assistance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:65780:108"/>
2. I would have you <hi>close with a resolution of
heart, to spend thy life as becomes one that hath
been meditating of holy and heavenly things.</hi> As
for example, I have been meditating of the
<hi>Promises,</hi> I will shut up my Meditation with
<hi>resolution, by the grace of God,</hi> to live more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Promises than ever I have done; I
have lived too much upon the Creature, but
now I will live more upon God, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
I will close up with a <hi>resolution,</hi> by the
power of my God, to study my interest in
the Promises more, and suck out the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of them more; and to be more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the freeness, and the fulness, and
riches, and preciousness of them. And so
would you meditate of <hi>Heaven?</hi> I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with a resolution, that I would labour to
live more heavenly, and walk as becometh
one that looks to live with Christ for ever in
Heaven. You must know these <hi>spiritual reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi>
are <hi>spiritualia vincula obedientiae,</hi> they
are <hi>spiritual bonds to tye the soul fast to God.</hi> As
the <hi>beast</hi> was tyed to the horns of the Altar in
the old Law, that was to be sacrificed; so
these blessed <hi>vows and resolutions</hi> are heavenly
cords to tye the soul faster to God; and that
is the reason every why Sacrament we renew
our <hi>vows and resolutions;</hi> as God renews his <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements</hi>
to us, so do we renew our <hi>engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:65780:109"/>
to God every Sacrament. Now I would
have you close up your Meditation by bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your souls faster to God, in a holy reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
<hi>Divine resolution is the spiritual hedg
of the soul</hi> (saith one) <hi>to keep the soul from
breaking out into ungodly courses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Shut up all with a short commendation of
thy self, thy body, thy soul, thy wife, thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
(if thou hast any) <hi>thy estate,</hi> all that
thou hast, recommend them unto thy God; shut
up all with a <hi>sweet resignation</hi> of thy self, and
all thy affairs, and all thy ways; As <hi>David</hi>
saith, <hi>Commit your ways unto the Lord;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
your selves and your affairs, all that you
are, all that you have, into the hands of the
Lord, as a faithful Creator, and a merciful
Redeemer. I would have you close up all
with a committing, and a submitting; <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
thy ways unto God, submitting unto
God in all his ways;</hi> purposing to live to his
glory, and to walk worthy of that heavenly
calling to which thou art called. And thus I
have put an end to this subject of Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.
Now what remains but to perswade
you to the practise of these things? That
which a learned man who hath written a <hi>Tract</hi>
called, <hi>The art of Divine Meditation,</hi> closeth
his Book withal, let me close this with: saith he,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65780:109"/>
               <q>Oh that my words were as so many gourds
to quicken up the dead, and dull, and drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
hearts of Christians, to a conscientious
practice of this excellent duty of Divine Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation!</q>
It is a strange speech that he
useth! saith he, <q>I will give any man leave
to curse me upon his death-bed, if he doth
not then acknowledg, that those hours that
he hath spent in Divine Meditation, have
been the best hours that he hath spent in all
his life; if he doth not then confess he is
sorrowful that he spent no more hours in
so blessed a work.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sure I am, when you lye upon your death-bed,
this will be your comfort: Lord, I have
been often in Heaven in Meditation, and now
I am going to that place that I am acquainted
withal: Oh my God! I have been often with
thee in the Mount, I have been often medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
of thee: Oh my blessed Saviour! thou
art no stranger to me; I have been often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
of Christ. Oh what comfort will
this be to you when you lye upon your
death-beds! I will not say, <hi>curse me</hi> if you do
not find this true; but I will say, this is as
sure as the Word of God is true, you will find
it so.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>four</hi> things I will conclude this
Discourse withal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:65780:110"/>
1. I would humbly beseech you, that you
would mourn before God that you have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so many years in the School of Christ,
and have been no more acquainted with this
duty of Divine Meditation: I believe there
are very many that have been long standers in
Christ's School, that never yet practised
this duty of Divine Meditation, that never
were half an hour together in the Mount of
God solemnly and seriously. Now I beseech
you, mourn before the Lord, that we have
been no more acquainted with this blessed
and heavenly duty.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Let us mourn before the Lord that we
have misplaced our meditation;</hi> for the heart
of man is restless, it is like the weight of a
Clock, that will never leave going down as
long as it is wound up; the heart of man
will always be meditating of something or
other; like mill-stones, if they once grind,
they will grind one another; the heart of
man will always be grinding, always musing,
always meditating on something or other:
Now mourn before God heartily, and go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Closets and bemoan it, that you have
<hi>ground chaff</hi> to your immortal souls all your
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65780:110"/>
lives long; that you have spent your days in
meditating what to eat, and what to drink,
and what to be clothed withal, and how to
grow rich, and how to manage your trading,
and your calling, how to thrive in the world,
how to get such preferments; you have been
meditating all your lives long upon vain
things, and have not meditated upon the <hi>things
of eternity,</hi> those things that do most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
you; you have been meditating upon
trifles, upon things that will not profit at the
hour of death, and forgot to meditate of
those things that are of eternal concernment;
our Saviour Christ complains of those men,
<hi>Mat. 6. Take no thought for your lives, what
you shall eat, and what you shall drink, nor for
your body what you shall put on;</hi> as if he should
say, why do you spend all your time in taking
thought of eating, and drinking, and clothing,
and outward things? <hi>Which of you</hi> (saith he)
<hi>can by taking thought add one cubit to your sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
All your musing and meditating of
them is vain. Can a Dwarf by thinking he is
a Dwarf, make himself taller? it is not all
your musing and your meditating of these
outward things, I mean your inordinate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating,
will advantage you. I grant Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
must have time to meditate of worldly
things; I will not lay heavier burdens than
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65780:111"/>
the Scripture doth lay; but when you ravel
away all your time in meditating upon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, and never are serious in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of heavenly things, this I would
have you mourn for; you that are old people,
and have been many years professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
Oh mourn that you have wasted your
<hi>intellectual faculty,</hi> that you have wasted that
glorious faculty of soul, your <hi>understanding,</hi> in
such vain and trifling things; nay, are there
not some that do not only meditate of vain
things, but spend many hours in meditating on
vile things? that devise mischief upon their
beds, and meditate how to cozen their
neighbours, how to be revenged upon their
neighbour, how to do mischief, how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
about their wicked designs? are there
not some that meditate to do evil, and rejoice
in the meditation of evil when they have done
it? Many old men meditate with joy of their
youthful vanities, and wickedness committed
in their youth, they chew over their wicked
ways with delight, which we call <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
wickedness.</hi> Oh let us bewail and bemoan
it before God, that we have squandered away
our immortal souls, by exercising the glorious
faculty of the <hi>understanding</hi> in such poor tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
things, it may be lustful, revengeful, vile,
wicked thoughts; either in doing that which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65780:111"/>
is evil, or in meditating on the evil we have
done; instead of mourning for it, rejoicing
in it.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>I would perswade you to study the necessity,
the excellency, the usefulness, and profitableness
of Divine Meditation;</hi> let me tell you for the
<hi>conclusion,</hi> this duty is not only a duty, but
the <hi>quintessence and marrow of all other duties;</hi>
there is no duty will take impression upon
your souls without the practise of this duty;
it is the very life and soul of Christianity,
without which a Christian is but the carcass
of a Christian. I have shewed, that the want
of Divine Meditation is the cause of all sin,
and all punishment; I have shewed you, that
the practise of Meditation will help to beget
Grace, and increase Grace, and resist the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and all his temptations.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Let me perswade you all, that you would
put this duty in practise;</hi> especially you that are
rich people, Gentlemen, Merchants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
you that have estates, you that are
Gentlemen, may spare time from your sports;
and you that are rich Merchants and others,
may take time from your outward occasions:
O let me intreat you that you would take
some spare-time every day, to go up to the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65780:112"/>
Mount of God, to meditate of some of those
<hi>Subjects</hi> that I have propounded to you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>vanity
of the world,</hi> whatsoever the <hi>Subject</hi> is, that
is holy and heavenly. I will not lay burdens
upon you, I know there may be such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that you cannot; but ordinarily that you
would as often as you can, make conscience
to accustom your selves to this necessary and
<hi>long-neglected duty</hi> of Divine Meditation.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you, you would be tall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in grace if you did accustom your
selves to this duty; the reason why you are
such Dwarfs in Christianity, and so unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with God, and the Promises, and
Christ, and Heaven, is for the want of the
practice of this duty; this is the reason why
you creep upon the ground, and are so poor
in Grace, and so lean in Religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me intreat you, especially you whose
happiness is that you need not work every
day to provide for your families; the Lord
hath given you an estate, and you may spare
time; Oh let it not be said <hi>at the day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that you lost <hi>Heaven</hi> for the want of
the practising this duty of <hi>Divine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:65780:112"/>
And then you that are <hi>poor people,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find time; you that are <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,</hi>
that have not time, remember what I
said concerning <hi>Occasional Meditation,</hi> I
shewed you how you might meditate when
you were about your <hi>worldly business;</hi> there
is no lawful calling that a man can be in, but
if he hath a <hi>heavenly heart</hi> he may <hi>heavenlize</hi>
that calling, he may take <hi>occasion</hi> (as Christ
takes occasion to heavenlize his Discourse
from outward things) to raise Heavenly Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
when thou art at work, thou maist
be by <hi>Divine Meditation</hi> in Heaven. But
let me perswade you all on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi>
(though you have not time on the week-day
for set, solemn Meditation; yet then you have
time for occasional Meditation, for on the
<hi>Sabbath</hi> all your work ceaseth) that is the
<hi>day</hi> that God hath set a part for <hi>publick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
and <hi>private Meditation;</hi> Meditation on
the work of <hi>Creation,</hi> and the work of
<hi>Redemption;</hi> it is a great work we are
to do upon the <hi>day of our rest,</hi> to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
of our <hi>Eternal Rest</hi> in Heaven;
therefore let me perswade you to spend
some time on the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
but especially on the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-days.</hi>
There are <hi>Twelve</hi> Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I propounded to meditate on upon
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65780:113"/>
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and I chose this <hi>Subject</hi>
to help you with <hi>Sacramental Meditation;</hi>
it hath pleased God to carry me out fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the handling of it than ever I
thought.</p>
