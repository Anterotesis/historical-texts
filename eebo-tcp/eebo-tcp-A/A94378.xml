            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Ship of this Kingdome being now toſſed with the Waves and Tempeſts of a Civill and unnaturall Warre, (the ſharpeſt and ſoreſt of all Gods Arrowes) It is no time for any man (like <hi>Ionas)</hi> to lie ſnorting in the bottome of the Ship, but we muſt all indeavour to uſe ſome means for to ſtop the current of this inundation, and overflowing of Gods judgements upon us, and as by our many great and crying ſins we have provoked God to wrath and indignation againſt us; ſo by our humiliation, prayer, and reformation, we ought to ſeek to appeaſe his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Majeſtie: Which that every perticular man may the better put in execution, I have collected theſe conſiderations and Meditations following, out of the word of God, which may ſerve as directions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170690:3"/>
unto all ſorts of people, how to behave and diſpoſe of themſelves in the moſt ſad and diſconſolate times.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Let a man examine himſelf, whether he be in the eſtate of grace or not? Let us try our faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; if we will not try our ſelves, we ſhall be tried, it is therefore our duty to do it before hand: Let us look that we lay a good foundation, and build upon the ſure and immoveable rock Chriſt Jeſus, and then let the flouds of affliction beate. (Lam. 3 40.) Let the Stormes and Tempeſts of perſecution blow never ſo, yet we ſhall ſtand firm and ſure. Mariners, you know its enough for them almoſt, that they know their ſhips good, however they be toſſed, they know the nature of the Seas, I am well imbarqued; why ſo may you in the middeſt of all your toſsings who are right with him; ſay, I am in a good veſſell, I am in Chriſt, here is my Ark; let the world rage, let what will come, I am in Chriſt, I am in a very bleſſed Ark. (Math. 3. 26, 27, 28. Mar. 5. 37. Luk. 8. 28. Rom. 13. 14.)</p>
            <p n="2">2 We ſhould wean our mindes from the love of the world. A thing hanged on a pin is eaſily heaved off, but the things that are glewed or cemented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are hardly ſurrendred or divided. <hi>David</hi> loved <hi>Abſalom</hi> too much, which made him ſo much lament for the loſſe of him. Exceſsive love to the world makes the croſſe the harder to be indured. (2 Sam 18. 33.)</p>
            <p n="3">3 We ſhould be twice as much exerciſed in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties, as in other more peaceable times. When
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170690:3"/>
               <hi>Iudas</hi> was plotting, Chriſt went to the paſſeover; when Almighty God comes to viſit, let him finde us well imployed; let us be moved with reverence and diligence to uſe means to ſave our ſelves, and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, &amp; all that belong unto us. Mat. 26. 14. Lu. 22. 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4 We ſhould labor to keep a good conſcience, that when we have troubles without, we may have peace within. For (ſaith <hi>Salomon)</hi> a good conſcience is a continuall Feaſt. (Acts 24. 16. 1 Cor. 1 3. Gal. 1. 3.)</p>
            <p n="5">5 We ſhould inure our ſelves to ſome hardneſſe, a delicate perſon will hardly ſuffer. We ſhould deny our ſelves ſomething in meat, ſomething in apparell. Let us abaſe our ſelves leſt God abaſe us. God threatens a ſevere curſe by the mouth of his Prophet, unto thoſe that humble not themſelves in times of common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie. (Joel 2. 1. 12. Zeph. 1. 12.)</p>
            <p n="6">6 Pray and ſue and intreat evermore, for the favour of God; it wilbe intolerable to apprehend the wrath of God and the wrath of man both at once; God hath promiſed, that if we cal upon him in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he wil hear. (Pſa. 50. 15. Jam. 5 13. Jer. 29. 12.)</p>
            <p n="7">7 Let us make much of the promiſes, they being up, wilbe as ſtrong waters to keep us from fainting. Amongſt other precious promiſes of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, meditate upon theſe Texts following:</p>
            <p>Pſa. 125. 1, 2. They which truſt in the Lord, ſhalbe as M. Sion which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. As the mountains are round about Jeruſalem, ſo the Lord is about his people, from henceforth even for

ever. 1 Sam <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 9. The Lord will keep the feet of his Saints. Prov. 1. 33. Who ſo hearkneth unto me, ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet for fear of evill. Pſal. 91. 4. He will cover thee under his wings, and thou ſhalt be ſure under his feathers, his Truth ſhall be thy ſword and buckler. Pſal. 121. 3, 4, 5. He will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy foot to be moved, he that keepeth thee will not ſlumber: Behold, he that keepeth Iſrael will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlumber nor ſleep. The Lord is thy Keeper, the Lord is thy ſhade upon thy right hand. Seeing the Lord is our Keeper, we need not fear the greateſt dangers in the moſt dangerous times. <hi>(See alſo,</hi> Job. 11. 18, 19. Matth. 10. 39. Chap. 19. 24. Pſal. 125. 3. 1 Sam. 2. 20. Deut. 28. 7. Deut. 30. 7. Prov. 21. 18.)</p>
            <p n="8">8 Get into thy heart, ſound and experimentall knowledge of the truth, as alſo the love of it. It is the truth we are likely to ſuffer for, we cannot ſuffer for that we do not know, much leſſe for that we do not love. (Joh. 17. 3. Tit. 1. 16. Joh. 18. 37.)</p>
            <p n="9">9 We ſhould labour to incourage and comfort one another in theſe evill times; God hath a Book of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them that ſpeak often one to another. Mal. 3. When men do ask what news? we ſhould que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with them, what ſhall we do to eſcape Gods judgments? ſhall we pray and humble our ſelves? ſhall we faſt? ſhall we become new men, and binde our ſelves to God with an everlaſting covenant? Many good friends oftentimes in the world ſhake hands at parting, therefore when we keep our ſolemn Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170690:4"/>
which ſhould be now more often then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we ſhould keep them with the more reverence and devotion, for we know not whether we ſhall make them any more. (Mal. 3. 17. Luk. 21. 38. Joel 1. 14. Pr. 27. 12. Iſa. 45. 20. Ezr. 6. 23. Neh. 8. 30. 1 Pe. 5. 6.)</p>
            <p>When we make our humble repentance unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we had need do it ſincerely indeed, it may be our laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is ſaid of certain Hawkes in colder Countries, that they are moſt earneſt and eager to take their prey, when the day light there is of leaſt continuance. Let us not care ſo much what ſhall be after us in the World, but let us care what will become of us when we are departed, in the World to come. Hear good counſell (ſaith <hi>Auſtin)</hi> do that before death, which may do thee good when thou art dead. When the Church in <hi>Heſters</hi> time, was ſold to be deſtroyed by wicked counſell (as we now are) <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> and all the Jews, they faſted, and humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord, and had a glorious deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. (Eſth. 4 15. 16.)</p>
            <p>We ſhould labour to make good our intereſt in God, to clear up our evidence for heaven, our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God in Chriſt; when <hi>David</hi> was driven from home and harbour, he incouraged himſelf in the Lord his God: <hi>Tolle meum, &amp; tolle Deum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</hi> If a man knowes, that God is his in Chriſt, his friend, his God, his habitation, his Rock, unto whom he may continually reſort; he will ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf in the loſſe of all outward things thus:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170690:5"/>
Well, though I have loſt my houſe, yet I have kept my God, he is ſuch an habitation as cannot be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſuch an habitation as cannot be plundered, ſuch an habitation, as winde, and rain, and weather, cannot beat through; ſuch an habitation, as I may carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the World with me. (Pſal. 73. 23. Pſal. 18. 1, 2. 1 Sam. 2. 2. Prov. 10. 29. Iſa. 49. 8. 9.)</p>
            <p>There is a ſtory of a King, that when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed a Countrey, in his deſtroying fell in Love with a beautifull woman, whom he brought away with him and married, and afterwards much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her that he had ſlain her father, that hee had killed her husband, maſſacred her friends, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Countrey, ſhe anſwers him ſweetly again with a great deal of affection: My husband, my father, my friends and Countrey are now in thee O King; This is that Love which God would fain have from you, and this is that language which would expreſſe a great deal of Peace and comfort in your Soules, and which the hand of God now leads you to, at this time, when God threatens your Countrey, when he brings confuſion upon your eſtates, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys your armies, if he ſhould go further, if he ſhould turne your Countrey abſolutely into a wilderneſſe, if he ſhould take away all your deare Relations from you; Then do you comfort your ſelves after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Whats my countrey? Which are my children? and where is my eſtate? My countrey, my children and my eſtate, They are in thee oh my God. Be ſure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170690:5"/>
of this therefore that you cleere your intereſt in God himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We ſhould learn now before the rainy day come to be dead unto all the world. The Man that is dying is ſenceleſſe, not affected with the cries of his Children, wife and friends, that ſtand round about him, though they weep and wring their hands he is not ſtirred, Why? Becauſe being a dying man he is dead to them; and if you be dead to your houſes, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Eſtates aforehand, you will be able to buckle and grapple with that condition, So it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> who died daily, 2 Cor. 5. 4. Phil. 1. 21.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Have ever ſweet thoughts of Death from this conſideration, this world, this life is a ſtage of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Death is but your Exit, by it you go off the Stage, why then death puts an end to your part of ſorrow; tis a ſtrange darkeneſſe that lies upon our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that makes death fearfull to us, indeed tis this life that's dreadfull, all the ſufferings of a ſaint they are contained within the compaſſe of this life; and life is nothing elſe but a Tract of ſufferings, and death cuts the thread of all our ſorrws, by cutting the thread of life: He that writes the life of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> tells a ſtory of him; An holy man was upon the point of dying, but was very unwilling to die, a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of young men, clothed with a beauty and majeſty more then earthly, appeared to his bedſide and ſpake thus: <hi>O vaine men, what ſhall I do with you, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:170690:6"/>
               <hi>indure miſeries, and yet you are unwilling to goe hence, you cannot indure pain, and yet you deſire to live.</hi> Let me ſay this to you all, why are you afraid to die? Doe you love ſorrowes? Are you unable to beare mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and are you unwilling to go off from this ſtage of ſuffering? In this life we are as it were in a dark cave, beyond which is a glorious habitation, why are you afraid of paſſing the flame, the flame is at the very mouth of the Cave, and you are no ſooner in it, but you are out of it. Live in grief, theſe your griefs are as the glory of your God upon you; Die cheerefully when you die, becauſe with the loſſe of life, you enter into glory.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Let us ſet before our eyes the joyes of heaven, as Chriſt did. Heb. 12. That man that doth not minde the things of this life is never likely to be rich, (if he do not minde them in a moderate way) ſo that man that doth not minde the joyes of Heaven ſhall never come thither. Where ſhould the Members bee but where the Head raigneth? Where ſhould the heart be but where our Heavenly treaſure is? Chriſt who is our Treaſure is in heaven, whither our affections firſt aſcend and then we follow after. (Heb. 12. 2. Mat. 6. 19. 20. Luk. 12. 33. 1 Tim. 6. 19.)</p>

our clothing, and then make ready to reſt. A night of Affliction and deſtruction is now coming upon the Kingdome, let us be willing to depart as we came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, naked. <hi>A great Conquerour of the world would have his Enſigne-bearer carry forth a ſorry cloth or ſhrowding ſheet, ſaying: Lo here is all of his conqueſts, that a worthy Captain doth carry with him.</hi> (Saladin.

            <p n="14">14. Let us often meditate upon the fire of Hell. The Scripture calls it, A Bottomleſſe Pit, Tophet, a Dungeon, large and deepe, the burning whereof is fire and brimſtone; The Lake of the ſecond death. If a man cannot indure a little fire in one part of his body (as on his little finger) but one hour, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable ſhall the paine of the damned be when they ſhall burne within and without! Who can dwell with everlaſting burning (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Eſay)</hi> And yet our fire here is but a picture and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that unquenchable fire there in Hell, where one drop of cold water will be more worth then all the Jewels of the World, though only to coole the tongue. (Reve. 9. 1 &amp; 20. 15. Mat. 22. 13.)</p>
            <p n="15">15. Let us ſet before our eyes the example of the Saints which have ſuffered, for the truth we profeſſe. Examples ſhew us it is novelty, nor impoſſibility to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpels. Who would not follow having ſuch a cloud of witneſſes. He. 12. 1. 1 Pet. 4. 16. 17. 18.</p>

Spare not one ſin unmortified, keep not belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Dalilah,</hi> for it will make us more woe then we think for, and will make us have inward fears and doubtings, when others ſhall have conſolation. Chriſt when he aroſe, he aroſe early; <hi>Lazarus</hi> that lay four dayes, began to ſavour, If we lie long in our ſins we ſhall wax unſavoury too. We ſee by experience, that the longer we defere the curing of wounds, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is their rocovery at the laſt. Jer. 8. 11. 1 Kin. 17. 13</p>

            <p>There are three things, that will make that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition very uncomfortabe: Pride, wanton abuſe of your creature Comforts, and unwillingneſſe to lay them out in the cauſe of God.

If it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to bring any into that condition; Let them firſt humble themſelves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the puniſhment of their iniquitie, and ſay; The Lord is righteous in all that is come upon them: So did <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 9. 7.

            <p n="3">3 Be carefull to keep Gods promiſe in your full view. The promiſe is very full and clear, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is there enriched with more promiſes?

Remember that promiſe where God hath ſaid; (Matth. 19. 29.) Thoſe that forſake houſe and land, ſhall receive an hundred fold. Then remember the 100 fold promiſe. But would you return to your own houſe, and are you afraid you ſhall not do ſo? Then remember that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Micah 4. 6. 7. In that day (ſaith the Lord) will I aſſemble her that halteth, and gather her that is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out. and her that I have afflicted. In the interim,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170690:9"/>
are you afraid of miſery, povertie, beggerie? Then remember that promiſe which hath 5 ſeales upon it, I will never leave you nor forſake you: Where in the Originall there are 5 negatives, as if he ſhould ſay thus; I will never, never, never, never, never, leave you, or forſake you. (Heb. 1. 3. 5. Joſ. 1. 5.) <hi>Luther</hi> inſiſts much upon that promiſe of our Saviour Chriſt unto his Diſciples, (Matth. 10. 33.) You ſhall not have gone over all the Cities of Judea, untill the Sonne of man ſhall come: The ſonne of man was already come (ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he did ſpeak theſe words, and therefore the promiſe belongs not onely to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but to all the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt that ſhall be, the promiſe ſpeaking thus much; that though they be perſecuted and driven from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet there ſhall be alwayes ſome place open to receive them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When perſecution is in one place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſhall be free from it, and there ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſome place free untill the Sonne of Man ſhall come. Stock and ſtore your ſelves with many ſuch promiſes, that when this miſery ſpoken of ſhall come; keep them in your full view. Think on all theſe things (I ſay) for the preſent, and in the future if ſuch a condition fall. And the Lord give us underſtanding in all things.</p>
