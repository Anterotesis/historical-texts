            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Ages a Custome, (and still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains

of <hi>Curious</hi> and Polite Learning,

thereby in some measure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their Gratitude: As also

Splendor from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons

the better acceptation in the

<pb facs="tcp:52901:3"/>
that looking so like Flattery, I

the Limits of an Epistle:
Nor need I attempt the doing
this, since your Lordships tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Noble Qualities, are so E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently
known to the whole
Nation.</p>
            <p>I Address this Book to your
Lordship, not for any of the
aforegoing Arguments, but
chiefly for the following Cause.
<pb facs="tcp:52901:4"/>
The Art by which the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
produced in these Papers
are made, (<hi>viz. Chymistry</hi>) hath
in all Ages been imbraced, and
cultivated by both the Learned
<hi>Magi</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> and is at this day
much prized, and Practised by
many of the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany:</hi>
And highly esteemed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
by the Example of our
own <hi>Sovereign's</hi> delighting in
it, and favouring of it. And
it must be granted that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
could not bestow so
much Honour upon it, as it
hath gained (in this our time)
by obtaining your Lordships
Favour. For you have
added new <hi>Rayes</hi> to Illustrate
<pb facs="tcp:52901:4"/>
it, by your Studying and
Practising of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Having mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this, I have shewed the
cause why I presume to make
you this Present: The Treatise
it self being of that <hi>Art,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
your Lordship is so great a
Master; And therefore I hope
the Argument will not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful.
The Original Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is sufficiently known (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad)
to be both a Learned,
and Practically knowing Man,
and he thought this piece worth
the presenting to a whole Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of Men, that are likewise
such themselves; I mean the
<hi>German Academy</hi> of the <hi>CURIOSI.</hi>
It hath also the Applause of
<pb facs="tcp:52901:5"/>
many of our ingenious <hi>Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osi</hi>
of the <hi>Royal Society:</hi> These
Reasons have incouraged me to
put it into <hi>English:</hi> And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
it at your Feet. Desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>GOod Wine needs no Bush; Nor
Good Books Commendatory Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
And yet as the <hi>Vintner</hi> will
hang out his <hi>Garland</hi> to draw in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomors
to his House, So also the <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller</hi>
thinks himself obliged both in
interest to himself, and Civility to
Thee, to put out this <hi>Sign</hi> to acquaint
Thee with the quality of the <hi>Ware</hi> he
here exposeth to Sale.</p>
            <p>Know then, this Treatise consists of
many Curious Experiments, which both
upon the account of their variety, use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
singularity, and ease in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them, must needs prove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
and consequently acceptable
to him that desireth to improve his
Dominion over the Creatures: which
is only to be acquired by gaining a true
knowledg of their Natures and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
<pb facs="tcp:52901:6"/>
which can no way be attained so
well, and with that certainty, as by
making Experiments upon them: of
which here are such plenty, and of such
different kinds, and those such as will
afford such fruitful hints to a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Reader, for Analogous Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
That I cannot but give this
Testimony, That I have not met with
a <hi>Tract</hi> which contains so much, in
so little roome, and without Confusion.
Add to this, That the Experiments
here alledged, are so easily practicable,
That a great part of them may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a Chamber, (by such common
and cheap means, as are constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be had, either at the <hi>Druggists,</hi> or
common <hi>Chymists</hi>) and do not require
a Specious <hi>Laboratory,</hi> (which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive,)
nor long attendance (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Chymical <hi>Processes</hi> do) which is
tedious: And yet these are not of the
Nature of <hi>Contingent</hi> Experiments
(which sometimes happen, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:52901:6"/>
fail, being much varied by flight
and unheeded Circumstances:) But
they are certain in their event, and
seldom subject to Miscariage. If
therefore <hi>Reader</hi> thou art virtuously
inclined, and hadst rather spend Thy
time innocently, and usefully, than
viciously, (not to say Modishly:) Thou
maist here be furnished with occasions
to do so. And to be serviceable to Thee
in this end, was indeed one of the
chief Motives which caused me to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Book into <hi>English;</hi> the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
being so valued beyond Sea, that it
was gratefully accepted there; and those
few <hi>Copies,</hi> which were transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hither, were quickly bought up, so
that the Book becoming scarce, I thought
it a charitable act to Translate it; and
thereby preserve it for thy use, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
to which intent I commend
the perusal of the Tract it self to Thee, 
And Remain Thy Friend,</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52901:9"/>
so great every where at this day hath
been their studious labour, and so great is
the <hi>Aemulation,</hi> and strugling of the most
flourishing Nations betwixt themselves:
that every one of them do seem to hope
in a small time to vanquish and triumph
over <hi>Nature.</hi> Truly it is a most Noble Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and such an one as former Ages
hath been unacquainted with: to which
if there shall be added, the greater Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> there is no
doubt left, but that at last from thence,
there will redound great Advantage to
the Publick.</p>
               <p>All of these are imployed about new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,

               <p>Upon this very occasion, I evolving

this intent therefore we have written this

say <hi>Curiosa,</hi> for neither is it such, that it
should be extold by us with high Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,

great advantages, or utility, but this praise
is sufficient for it, if by occasion of it, a

               <p>EXactly to teach the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Colour,</hi> is
as hard as to explain the true reason
of <hi>Light,</hi> of it self most clear: <hi>Iul. C. Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,
Exert. 325. Sect.</hi> 1. Rightly says, <hi>The
Causes, and Essence of Colours are as full of
controversy, and obscurity to the Intellect as they
are manifest to the sight.</hi> Aristotle <hi>Lib. de
sens. &amp; sensit. cap.</hi> 3. Defines Colour, that
it is <hi>perfiicui terminante extremitas: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of a terminated body that may be seen,
or seen through.</hi> Neither more clear is the
description of others, <hi>That it is a quality of
a coloured Body.</hi> Also <hi>that it is modifyed
Light.</hi> Many of the <hi>Chymists</hi> do attribute
all Colours to their principle of <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
others of them to <hi>Mercury:</hi> of which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
what is to be thought, it is very well
worth the reading of <hi>Dan. Sennertus, lib.
de consensu, Cap.</hi> 11. Excellent also is what
hath been delivered upon this Argument
by <hi>Antonius Scarmilionius Fulginas,</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52901:10"/>
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in his Book of <hi>Colours.</hi> See also
upon this subject, <hi>Petrus Maria Capenarius
lib. de Atrimentis,</hi> and <hi>Iohan. Christoph.
Kolhansius Tract. Optic.</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>But these controversies not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to our design, leaving them, we
will rather note the differences of Colours;
yet not all of them, since they are many;
(and already amongst others) they have
been sufficiently and subtilly explained by
<hi>Scaliger. Exercit. 325. Sect. 6. and in the
following:</hi> we will only touch upon and
handle slightly such of them now, as
will lead us the shortest way to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
end.</p>
               <p>For the material subject of Colours we
distinguish them into those which are real,
or true, and into such as are <hi>Emphatick,</hi> and
Apparent, or seeming. A <hi>Specimen,</hi> or
example of these is afforded by the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,</hi>
a <hi>Prismatick</hi> or Triangular Glass, the
redness of Wine spilt upon a Napkin.
These we divide again into <hi>Penetrative Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi>
such as <hi>Obryz,</hi> or pure <hi>Gold,</hi> and
<hi>Sealing Wax:</hi> and into such as are <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,</hi>
of which sort are <hi>Apples</hi> appearing
outwardly red, and yet are inwardly
white.</p>
               <p>Moreover Colours considered in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52901:11"/>
are either <hi>Primitive,</hi> or <hi>Simple;</hi> to wit,
<hi>White, Yellow, Green, Blew, Red, Black;</hi>
I say considered in <hi>Abstracto,</hi> or as they are
to be distributed into certain, and distinct
Clauses: for otherways <hi>Green</hi> seems rather
to be composed of <hi>Yellow</hi> and <hi>Blew,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be made of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> or <hi>Minerals.</hi>
So <hi>Auripigmentum,</hi> or <hi>Orpiment</hi> if mixed
with <hi>Indigo;</hi> or <hi>Gum of Peru</hi> cemented
with <hi>Cobalt,</hi> or <hi>Bergblau,</hi> as the <hi>Germans</hi>
call it, supposed to be the Native <hi>Cadmia,</hi>
or <hi>Copper-Stone:</hi> or mix <hi>Vltra Marine</hi>
with <hi>Saffron</hi> and you shall see a <hi>Green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
will proceed from these mixtures.</p>
               <p>Or else they are divided into <hi>compound
Colours</hi> made from the mixture of <hi>simple</hi>
ones: or else they are <hi>decompositi,</hi> or doubly
compounded, which are made again in
infinite variety by the mixture of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
ones among themselves, as may
be seen upon the <hi>Palates</hi> of <hi>Painters:</hi> but if
you go to the <hi>Laboratories</hi> of <hi>Chymists,</hi>
there you will be supplyed with a reason
very different from these, by which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
may be so changed, (and that with
a most delightful variety to behold) that
adding what is necessary to be added,
there will suddenly result, and appear new
Colours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52901:11"/>1. As <hi>Spirit of Turpentine,</hi> though of it
self it be clear, if it be poured upon <hi>Sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum
Saturni,</hi> (or Sugar of Lead) which
is also of it self exceeding White, if it be
digested upon it, will in a small time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Tincture</hi> intercely or extremely
Red.</p>
               <p>2. Also <hi>Spirit of Turpentine,</hi> if it be mixed
with <hi>Water,</hi> and strongly shook together,
will look like Milk; although this
milkiness is not lasting, but this <hi>oyly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
ascending to the superficies is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
or plainly vanisheth again. The
like of which happens if Oyl of Olives be
mixed with the <hi>Lixivium,</hi> or <hi>Lees</hi> of <hi>Vine
Ashes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Distilled Oyl of Aniseeds,</hi> (which is
wont to coagulate, and grow thick with
the cold Air,) if a <hi>Leaf of white Paper</hi> be
anointed with it, and a few drops of
<hi>Oyl of Vitriol</hi> be poured upon it, it will
presently grow Red; I say the <hi>Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi>
not the Spirit.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Syrup of Violets,</hi> which is of its self
of an obscure <hi>Purple Colour,</hi> is changed
into a vivid and <hi>brisk red,</hi> if you mix by
drops with it <hi>Spirit of Vitriol:</hi> (which
knack is now known to all the <hi>Apothecaries</hi>
Shops) if you shall add <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> to this,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52901:12"/>
a <hi>Green</hi> Colour will emerge from thence:
which will perish and be lost again, If you
add <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> to it again.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Syrup of Piony Flowers,</hi> if you mix
<hi>Salt of Vitriol</hi> with it, will become wholly
<hi>Black:</hi> the same happens to <hi>Syrup of Clove
Iuly-Flowers,</hi> if in the time of boyling it
be stirred with an <hi>Iron Spatula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Tincture of Coral,</hi> prepared with
distilled Vinegar, mixed with the <hi>Tincture
of Dasey Flowers,</hi> there will result from
thence a <hi>Liquor</hi> of an <hi>obscure Blew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. If you mix <hi>Silvius</hi>'s <hi>Sal volatile,</hi> or the
like <hi>Vrinous Spirit</hi> in small quantity, with
the same <hi>Tincture of Dasyes,</hi> or <hi>Roses,</hi> there
will arise an obsure <hi>Blew Colour;</hi> but if you
drop in a little more, it will be made an
obscure Red: Neither can you make that
Red Colour clear, although you should
add more (<hi>Spirit or Volatile Salt</hi>) to it.
It therefore follows that <hi>acid,</hi> or sour
<hi>Spirits,</hi> do strike a red Colour with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but <hi>urinous</hi> ones with obscureness.</p>
               <p>8. A Solution of <hi>Lead</hi> made with distilled
<hi>Vinegar,</hi> appeareth clear like <hi>common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
If you shall add to this <hi>Oyl of Tartar,</hi>
(<hi>per deliquium</hi>) which is also clear as Water,
the mixture will presently grow <hi>White as
Milk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52901:12"/>
9. If <hi>Antimony</hi> which is calcin'd with
<hi>Nitre</hi> be boyl'd in <hi>Fountain Water,</hi> the
straining will be clear, and almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
smell, which nevertheless by pouring
any <hi>Acid</hi> upon it, will acquire a <hi>Saffron
Colour,</hi> with a stinking scent.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Common Water</hi> in which <hi>Mercury
Sublimate</hi> hath been infused, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
grow <hi>Yellow</hi> by dropping into it
<hi>Oyl of Tartar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The solution of <hi>calcin'd Tin,</hi> mixed
with dissolved <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> becomes
<hi>Blew.</hi> Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> lib. <hi>de Ferment.</hi> cap. 11.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>Quicksilver</hi> and <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi>
ground together, <hi>and sublimed</hi> in a <hi>bolt
Head</hi> with <hi>a heat of Sand,</hi> will become a
<hi>white Powder,</hi> which suffer'd to dissolve
(by it self in the Air) will produce a
<hi>clear Liquor</hi> like <hi>Spring Water,</hi> which for
all its clearness, if <hi>Copper</hi> or <hi>Brass</hi> be moist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with it, they will appear <hi>silver'd;</hi> and
if <hi>Copper Vessels</hi> be slightly rub'd with it,
it will render them as if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>silver'd:</hi> although this be rather an
incrustation, (or coating of them over.)</p>
               <p>12. But a <hi>Powder</hi> to <hi>gild</hi> with, is
made thus. Dip fine <hi>Lint,</hi> made of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne-Cloath,
in <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> in which
<hi>Gold</hi> is dissolved, and having cast it into
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52901:13"/>
a <hi>Crucible,</hi> make a <hi>Circular Fire</hi> about it,
at a distance; and so by degrees reduce it
into a <hi>Powder:</hi> But towards the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the heat by bringing the Fire nearer
to the <hi>Crucible,</hi> and at last if you please,
take out the <hi>Powder</hi> and free it from durt
by pouring Water upon it, it will be
without <hi>splendor,</hi> or <hi>shining,</hi> and is of a
<hi>Violet colour;</hi> but if you rub it upon <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
the genuine splendor of <hi>Gold</hi> will
appear, which afterwards will be made
more splendid, and shining by polishing.</p>
               <p>13. <hi>Lignum Acanthinum,</hi> or the <hi>Wood</hi>
which is brought from <hi>Brazil,</hi> infused in
common water, will communicate a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
redness to it, like that of <hi>red Wine:</hi>
If you pour upon this a little <hi>distill'd Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi>
the Liquor will appear clear like
<hi>white Wine,</hi> but a few drops of <hi>Oyl of
Tartar</hi> reduces the Colour to a deep <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
after which, if you drop in <hi>Spirit of
Vitriol,</hi> it will be <hi>yellow</hi> like <hi>Sack:</hi> if you
cast on it <hi>Salt of Lead</hi> dissolved <hi>per deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium</hi>
(or in the <hi>Aire</hi>) the <hi>mixture</hi> will
be <hi>whitish</hi> like <hi>Milk.</hi> Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> (lib. <hi>de
Ferment.</hi> cap. 11.) proposeth this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
every Branch of which will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Trial but the fourth, for we by
adding <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> could not produce
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52901:13"/>
a <hi>pale Yellow,</hi> but made a certain obscure
<hi>Blew Colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. Have in a readiness a <hi>solution of
Vitriol,</hi> and likewise by it self an <hi>infusion
of Galls.</hi> If you pour both of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you will make <hi>Writing Ink.</hi> Add
<hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> to this, and the Blackness
will clear up; then cast in <hi>Oyl of Tartar,</hi>
and after a little working, and heat, there
will appear a <hi>light Red,</hi> or <hi>bright Bay Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:</hi>
which by mixing <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi>
again will be taken away, all clearing up
again: And you may reiterate this Circle
as often as you do by turns put in <hi>Oyl of
Tartar,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Vitriol:</hi> So that as
often as you please you may render the
Liquor of a light Red or Bay Colour, or
else clear again.</p>
               <p>15. It is also a pleasant Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
which is proposed by the excellent
Mr. <hi>Daniel Major,</hi> the Famous <hi>Professor of
the Vniversity of Denmark.</hi> Lib. <hi>de Chirurg.
Infusar.</hi> Dub. 9. to this purpose. Pour
into a good transparent Glass the <hi>Saphire
colour'd</hi> Water, made by the help of <hi>Spirit
of Sal Armoniack</hi> being put into a <hi>Brass
Bason:</hi> Afterwards add the common <hi>Clys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and the mixture being
shook, it will become clear: but if you
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52901:14"/>
add to it <hi>Oyl of Tartar</hi> it will be restor'd
to its former Blewness.</p>
               <p>16. Take one <hi>Ounce</hi> of the solution of
<hi>Crabs eyes,</hi> made with <hi>distilled Vinegar:</hi>
drop into it of the <hi>Salt Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi>
120 drops, and you shall perceive
the matter to grow <hi>Milky,</hi> and a <hi>white
Powder</hi> will fall to the <hi>bottom,</hi> if by turns
you pour upon this Liquor as many drops
of <hi>Ioac. Polemanus his Tincture</hi> of the <hi>Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi>
after some bubling, the Powder
which lay in the bottom will be dissolved
again, and the whole will be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an exceeding <hi>Red</hi> transparent <hi>Liquor,</hi>
indowed with a grateful <hi>Saline</hi> taste.</p>
               <p>17. The change of light doth also
cause a new Colour to appear. So we
have observed, the Flowers of <hi>Convolvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
or <hi>Bird-weed</hi> (that sort with the Blew
Flower and Ivy-shaped Leaves, with

a part of the Cheesy, or Curddy part of
the Milk swimming at the top, if you
strain this through a Cloath, the Red Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
will be more transparent. Being
led by the <hi>Analogy,</hi> or resemblance of this
Experiment, I have thought (that I may
add this by the by) whether or no the
<hi>whitishness</hi> of <hi>Chyle</hi> in an <hi>Humane Body,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mingled every day with the <hi>red Blood,</hi>
doth not perhaps grow red upon the like
account also. Although the <hi>common People</hi>
wrongfully suppose, this <hi>redness</hi> is induced
upon the Chyle by the <hi>Circular motion</hi> of
the <hi>Blood:</hi> but motion of it self doth
hardly appear sufficient for to change the
Colour, unless there be hid also in the
<hi>Blood</hi> it self a <hi>Saline Principle,</hi> which may
continue this <hi>Tincture</hi> so many years, even
to old Age, which is perfected by the
assistance of the Heart, its Vessels and
Heat.</p>
               <p>These and the like <hi>Phaenomina,</hi> or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
and their causes, perhaps might
be conveniently demonstrated, by the
<hi>smallest Particulars</hi> of which these <hi>Liquors</hi>
consists. A <hi>Battel</hi> composed of some
<hi>thousands of thousands</hi> which may be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,</hi>
and <hi>contracted</hi> at the will of the

                  <hi>Commander;</hi> nay being <hi>disordered</hi> by the
<hi>Enemy,</hi> may again be rallied, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into <hi>order.</hi> After the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
from the <hi>small Particles</hi> of Liquors
<hi>dilated</hi> ariseth <hi>perspicuity</hi> and <hi>whiteness:</hi>
but from their contraction <hi>obscurity</hi> and
<hi>blackness.</hi> Again, according as the <hi>dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
and <hi>contraction</hi> is more or less,
there will arise intermediate Colours;
<hi>Yellow, Red, Green, Blew.</hi> Whether those
that study the <hi>Opticks</hi> can render a more

               <head type="sub">Of the different ways of Distilling,
and particularly of bringing the
Tincture of Simples over the Helm,
or Alimbeck.</head>
               <p>THe various ways of Distilling depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
partly from the variety of <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,</hi>
of which some are to distil by <hi>Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
others by <hi>Descention:</hi> to say nothing
of <hi>Probatory, Cementatory, Reverberatory,</hi>
or <hi>Wind-Furnaces,</hi> partly also from the
difference of <hi>Vessels,</hi> of which sort are <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sica's,
Cucurbits,</hi> or <hi>Bodies, Retorts, Phials,
Alimbecks, Receivers,</hi> and others of that
kind. All which <hi>Apparatus</hi> or Furniture
may not only be seen in our Laboratory,
but are also described both by Writing,
and Figures by <hi>Andr. Libavius. Iohan.
Rhenanus,</hi> and the rest of those kind of
Artists.</p>
               <p>There is also other ways of Distilling,
respect being had not to the <hi>Furnaces,</hi> or
<hi>Vessels,</hi> but to the <hi>Matter</hi> which comes
forth during the Operation. For whilst
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52901:16"/>
the <hi>Fire</hi> worketh upon the <hi>Matter</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Distillation, <hi>Vapours</hi> ascend,
which being collected again fall into the
Receiver under the Form of a Liquor.</p>
               <p>To say nothing of Sublimation [to
wit, of <hi>Antimony,</hi> with <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi>]
by means of which there will also arise
fair, and great variety of Colours in the
head of the <hi>Alimbeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>first,</hi> as to what concerns
the <hi>Vapours,</hi> or <hi>Fumes,</hi> they also differ in
their colour. For <hi>Nitre</hi> though it be a
<hi>white Body,</hi> yet in Distillation (at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
time of the operation) gives red
<hi>Fumes. Vitriol</hi> of it self <hi>Green,</hi> or <hi>Blew,</hi>
affords white <hi>Fumes. Soot</hi> though it be
never so <hi>Black,</hi> yet the <hi>Fumes</hi> which fill
the <hi>Receiver</hi> are so <hi>White,</hi> that it seems to
be washed within with Milk.</p>
               <p>But <hi>secondly,</hi> as to the Liquors which
are come over into the <hi>Receiver,</hi> although
all of them compared together are not
altogether of the same <hi>Colour;</hi> yet it is
certain, if you consider almost infinite
plenty of <hi>Simples,</hi> there will be very little
difference or variety in them.</p>
               <p>Those which draw <hi>Aromatical Oyls,</hi>
may easily observe, that they come over
not <hi>White,</hi> but <hi>Coloured:</hi> As to instance <hi>Oyl
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52901:16"/>
of Cinnamon</hi> is <hi>Yellowish, Oyl of Mace</hi> is
of a <hi>Yellowish White, Oyl of Cloves</hi> is of a
<hi>Yellowish Black, Oyl of Rhodium Wood</hi> is
of a <hi>Yellow Colour</hi> tending to <hi>Red.</hi> And
as to distilled Waters, I think it worth
our remark, that every one of them (not
excluding all manner of Spirits) which
are commonly found in the <hi>Apothecaries
Shops,</hi> every one of them I say are limpid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and without Colour: Notwithstanding
the so great variety of <hi>Colour</hi> in the <hi>Herbs,
Roots, Leaves</hi> and <hi>Flowers</hi> from whence
they were distilled. All that <hi>Blackness,
Greeness, Blewness, Redness, Yellowness,</hi> &amp;c.
is left behind in the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi>
or in the <hi>Copper distilling Vessel,</hi> or
<hi>Vesica,</hi> or rather perisheth: there arising
(which is worth noting) nothing but
limpid, and almost colourless liquor.</p>
               <p>Truly, heretofore this Subject tyred
my thoughts, and I have many times
weighed this <hi>Problem;</hi> Whether or no
amongst so great variety of <hi>Simples,</hi> there
were not at least some <hi>Species,</hi> or sorts
of them which would bring over the
<hi>Helm</hi> or <hi>Alimbeck</hi> with themselves their
own <hi>Native Colours;</hi> I mention an <hi>Alim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>
only as the chief Instrument, not
excluding a <hi>Retort,</hi> or any other distilling
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52901:17"/>
Instrument. That there are some such
<hi>Species</hi> in <hi>Nature</hi> which will do this, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
hath taught me, nor do I repent
the pains; part of these I have my self
observed, part I have collected from the
<hi>observation</hi> of others: The <hi>Observations,</hi>
and <hi>Experiments</hi> are comprised in the
following Chapters. Let the Industry
of others add more to them.</p>

               <p>THat we may begin this Business, first
with <hi>Metals,</hi> although if they be

although the difficulty in distilling
them be somewhat less: but let the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
be what it will, having made trials

We prepare a Menstruum, by the help of

by degrees, and at last, with a very strong
fire; and so it will distil a few 'tis true,

by it self, or with the Tartarous Spirit of
Wine, will become an <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> which
is (true, and) not sophisticate with any

               <p>THere goes about a <hi>Story</hi> of a <hi>great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
that was very <hi>curious,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
called together to him certain <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymists,</hi>
shewed them divers <hi>Simples,</hi> which
having mixed together, he caused them to
be committed to distillation in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
but it happened that the <hi>Liquor</hi> as
it distilled did breath forth a grateful scent
of <hi>Musk.</hi> When this Illustrious Person
required of these <hi>Artists</hi> a reason of this
Odor, for they saw not the least Grain of
<hi>Musk</hi> mixed with the <hi>Simples;</hi> They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
themselves all day long, and yet
could produce no reason for the thing,
unless this <hi>Fragrant</hi> scent did arise from the
<hi>mixture</hi> of the <hi>Simples</hi> in a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
at length, about the Evening, the
Nobleman discovered to them the fallacy,
to wit, that unknown to them, he had
put <hi>Musk</hi> into the Nose of the <hi>Alimbeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As therefore we may counterfeit a <hi>Scent,</hi>
by putting into the <hi>Alimbeck, Musk, Civet,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52901:22"/>
or <hi>Odoriferous Flowers;</hi> In like manner
'tis possible to fain <hi>Colours</hi> since the <hi>Water</hi>
in its passing carries along with it self the
<hi>Tincture</hi> of those things which are imposed
in the <hi>Alimbeck:</hi> provided you light on
such Spectators upon whom this Leger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demain
or trick may pass.</p>
               <p>1. The most facile way of all is, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Flowers</hi> into the <hi>Beak</hi> or <hi>Spout</hi> of the
<hi>Alimbeck,</hi> (for example) put in <hi>Blew-Bottle
Flowers:</hi> so the <hi>Water</hi> by passing through
them will gain a <hi>Blew Colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If you think it necessary to do the
thing with more care, put betwixt the
<hi>Beak</hi> of the <hi>Alimbeck</hi> and the <hi>Receiver,</hi> a
<hi>Fistula</hi> or <hi>Pipe,</hi> wider in the middle then
at each end, or Bellyed like a Bottle, in
which let those Flowers be contained (the

               </p>
               <p>—Moreover this Pipe ought to be
somewhat wider in its uppermost end,

be seen in the <hi>Figure.</hi>

to shew upon a Stage, Thus: if there be
four <hi>Cucurbits</hi> or Bodies full of <hi>Water</hi> all in
one <hi>Furnace,</hi> put an <hi>Alimbeck</hi> upon each of
them, let it be done so that the <hi>Alimbeck</hi>
may only be seen, and the Pipes, or Beaks
hid. Let there be put into every Beak se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Flowers (for example) <hi>Blew-Bottles,
Violets, Marygolds, Red-Roses, Saffron,
Sanders,</hi> &amp;c. suddenly by the help of the
Fire the Liquors which are forced into the
Receivers will obtain different <hi>Colours,</hi>
not without the admiration of the common
People which stand by. The same thing
may be performed with those <hi>Bellyed Pipes</hi>
put betwixt and covered.</p>
               <p>4. This also is for ostentation, and shew:
If you take one, or more <hi>Wallnuts</hi> made
Hollow and Empty, and fill them with the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>roots</hi> of <hi>Saphire, coloured Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernel,</hi>

and stop them up lightly with wax. Then

distill it in Sand; from the heat within

               <p>BUt some body will answer; Ah! but these
are fallacies. Tis true. But you must
know, that these ridiculous things are also
necessary, lest you be deceived your self, and
that you may be able to detect the fraud
of others. <hi>Aristotles</hi> Sentence concerning
a wise man is this: <hi>Qui ipse non mentitur,

is not false himself, and can easily discover the
falshood of others.</hi> But now passing over
<hi>crafty cheats,</hi> let us proceed to <hi>Operations,</hi>
which are <hi>Genuine,</hi> and agreable to truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Veronica,</hi> or <hi>Fluellin,</hi> is a Plant known
to all the <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> and its Vertues both
as to <hi>the Breast,</hi> and <hi>Spleen;</hi> also its curing
of <hi>Vlcers,</hi> and <hi>Wounds,</hi> are much cryed
up to the Sick. Whether it were known
to the Antient Writers both <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin,</hi> is uncertain: Although <hi>Caesalpinus</hi>
refers it to <hi>Diascorides, Myosotida</hi> or <hi>Mous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eare.
lib. 11. cap.</hi> 214. others make it
another Plant. The kinds of it are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52901:24"/>
(by <hi>Herbalists</hi>) recorded to be eight:
amongst which the most usual is that
which by <hi>Caspar Bauhinus</hi> is called <hi>Veronica
Mas, supina &amp; vulgatissima.</hi> The <hi>Male
Fluellin</hi> the <hi>Superior,</hi> and <hi>most common.</hi>
There is prepared from it a <hi>Syrup, Conserve,
Salt, Wine,</hi> and also <hi>distilled Water:</hi> of
the former nothing, but concerning the
<hi>Wine,</hi> and the <hi>Water,</hi> take a couple of
<hi>Observations.</hi>
               </p>
               <div n="1" type="experiment">
                  <head>Experiment the first.</head>
                  <p>Take fresh <hi>Veronica,</hi> when it begins to
be in the <hi>Flower,</hi> cut it, and sprinkling it
with a little Water, cast it into a <hi>Glass
Body,</hi> and applying the like <hi>Alimbeck</hi> to it
distil it by <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> or Water. So
the <hi>Water</hi> which distills, will not be white
and limpid like to other Waters, but
<hi>Greenish.</hi> This <hi>Greeness</hi> though it be not
constant, yet it will last at least <hi>three
months,</hi> and afterwards it will begin to
vanish by degrees.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="experiment">
                  <head>Experiment the second.</head>
                  <p>If in the place of <hi>Fountain Water</hi> you put
on <hi>Wine,</hi> and draw it the same way by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52901:24"/>
                     <hi>Balneo,</hi> you will then also have a <hi>Green
Liquor,</hi> but in which the <hi>Greenness</hi> is much
deeper, and will also continue for a <hi>year,</hi>
and longer.</p>
                  <p>Truly this neat <hi>Tincture</hi> which <hi>Veronica</hi>
brings over the <hi>Alimbeck</hi> with it, seems to
be a Note, or Character of the efficacy,
which is indulged to that <hi>Plant</hi> before a
thousand others.</p>
                  <p>Let no Body here accuse <hi>Copper</hi> for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this <hi>Tincture:</hi> for if the distillation be
made in <hi>Glass Vessels,</hi> the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Veroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
will be equally <hi>Green.</hi> The latter way
by <hi>Glasses</hi> is best to perform it, and by that
means it will clearly evidence that this
<hi>Greenness</hi> doth not proceed from <hi>Copper,</hi>
but springs only from the peculiar Nature
of the Plant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But concerning Vegetable Waters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
by</hi> Copper Vessels <hi>not exactly</hi> Tyn'd,
<hi>we have observed this; if they contain any
thing of</hi> Copper, <hi>by putting in a</hi> drop, <hi>or two
of the</hi> Salt Spirit <hi>of</hi> Sal Armoniack, <hi>they
will become</hi> Milky <hi>or</hi> White; <hi>but if they
have no</hi> Copper, <hi>they will remain clear.
However the observation of</hi> Otto Tacheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
(<hi>an excellent Physitian of</hi> Venice) <hi>may
seem to look otherways, concerning</hi> Rose-Water
<hi>distilled by a</hi> Copper-Vessel; <hi>which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52901:25"/>
he proposeth,</hi> chap. 19. Hippocr. Chymic.
<hi>to this sence:</hi> It doth eat off certain Atoms
from the Copper, which are invisibly mixed
with the Water. Would you see the Copper? drop
into the Water some drops of an Vrinous Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by it the whole Water will grow green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish:
because the acidity of the Rose Water,
doth with more greediness snatch to it self the
light, and more like it self Alcaly than the
Metal, which therefore by degrees falls Green
to the Bottom.</p>
                  <p>Whilst I am writing this a certain not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expert
Man in the Art of distillation doth
affirm, that the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Sage,</hi> and also of
<hi>Rosemary,</hi> will be <hi>Green,</hi> as well as that of
<hi>Veronica,</hi> if they be managed with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
dexterity, and moderate swiftness.
The truth of which <hi>Experience</hi> will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>BOtanists, or Herbarists,</hi> are wont to
reckon ten sorts of this <hi>Plant,</hi> amongst
which the most eminent are the <hi>common
Camomil with the Noble Flower Single, and
with the full, or double Flower Camomil
without scent, and stinking Camomil</hi> or <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed;</hi>
but I shall chiefly have to do in this

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>distilled Water</hi> of this is to be had
in <hi>Apothecaries Shops</hi> after the manner of
other waters limpid and colourless. There
is also to be sold its <hi>Oyl,</hi> made by infusion
from the <hi>Yellow Flowers.</hi> But that which
is made by distillation from the same Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
is very different from this, for it is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>saturated</hi> and fill'd with a <hi>Saphire Colour,</hi>

                  <q>That is, there is sent from <hi>New-Spain</hi>
a certain kind of thick Wood,
without Knotts, like the substance of a
Pear-Tree, it hath been long made use
of in these parts, against the distempers
of the Kidnies, and the difficulties, and
inconveniences of making Urine. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it was found by experience that its
Water was beneficial in the Obstructions
of the Liver, and Spleen. It is prepared
after this manner; The Wood being
shaved and smal cut, let it be steeped in
the best and clearest Fountain Water, and
left in it till it be consumed by those that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52901:29"/>
drink it: Half an hour after the Wood is
put into the Water, the Water will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
a pale Blew, which is heightned by
degrees according to the time it remains
in it, and yet the Wood is White (or rather
Brown.) I therefore mention this Blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
because it is counterfeited with
another Wood like it, (which gives the
Water a Saffron Colour) lest any body
should be deceived.</q>

But I may repeat one of them here, which
concerns the redintegration of the once
lost Blew Colour. But because the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
Relation is a little too long, I will
repeat it with more brevity. Drop into
the <hi>double coloured</hi> Infusion of the Wood, a
few drops of the <hi>Spirit of Wine Vinegar,</hi> so
the <hi>Blew Colour</hi> will vanish, the Saffron
one remaining. Upon this pour a little
<hi>Oyl of Tartar per deliquium,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
the Blew Colour will return, and
the Infusion will appear as before of two
Colours, perhaps by the <hi>acidity of the Salt</hi>
the <hi>Particles</hi> are broke, and returned to
their former position, which were kept
under by the heavy <hi>Oyl of Tartar.</hi>

               <p>OLd Wine deposits two sorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements;
<hi>to wit Dregs,</hi> and <hi>Tartar.</hi>
The Dregs are the grosser, and earthly
parts of the Wine which after fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it lets fall (like Slime and Mudd) to
the Bottom of the Vessel, it not being void
of a useful <hi>saltness,</hi> from whence the <hi>Wine</hi>
gains strength: So that taken from this
root as it were, and put into another
Vessel, it will not endure any long time,
but will easily degenerate.</p>
               <p>Concerning the usefulness of these <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
or Dregs, we have a testimony in
<hi>Brandy,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> which the <hi>Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
and <hi>Distillers</hi> make from them: That
we may omit other uses now, which are
not unknown to the common people.</p>
               <p>But this we suppose is hardly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of by every body, that an <hi>Oyl</hi> is to be
prepared from these <hi>Faeces</hi> or <hi>Dregs</hi> which
ascends the <hi>Alimbeck</hi> of a <hi>Green Colour.</hi> In
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52901:32"/>
this Operation 'tis to be observed, that that
<hi>Oyl</hi> is most green which distilleth last, but
this <hi>Greenness</hi> doth vanish with length of
time: Nay presently, if you rectify the
<hi>Oyl,</hi> it being changed into a Yellowishness.
Let the distilling vessels be well covered
with <hi>Tin,</hi> lest you suppose the <hi>Tincture</hi>
doth arise from the erotion of the <hi>Copper</hi>
in its passage. Many affirm that from the
pressings, or husks of <hi>Grapes,</hi> an Oyl may
be likewise made, after the same manner,
which will ascend <hi>Green. Wild Pinks,</hi> or
<hi>Carnations</hi> whilest they are in <hi>Flower,</hi> and
running up to <hi>Seed,</hi> if the whole <hi>Plant</hi> be
fresh gathered, cut small, and distilled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the usual manner, there commonly
swims on the top of the Water drawn by
the <hi>Alimbeck,</hi> a <hi>Greenish Oyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will find the same thing to be true,
with the Garden <hi>Smallage,</hi> or <hi>Parsley</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
after the same manner, if you have
wrought aright: but this Greenness is
but temporary, and of small duration. But
the Oyls of <hi>Chervil,</hi> and <hi>Parsley</hi> which

                  <hi>Curcuma,</hi> or <hi>Turmerick roots</hi> are vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>But besides all the aforementioned,
there is another sort which grows with
us, in the Fields near the City, which
for certain reasons we call the <hi>Blew Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinel;</hi>
the same also may be found near
<hi>Steinford,</hi> a place six Miles distance from
hence, where it is propagated in the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick-Garden</hi>
of the <hi>Court;</hi> and also at
<hi>Frankfort</hi> by the way side.</p>
               <p>If you regard its <hi>Figure,</hi> it doth not
seem to belong to those sort of <hi>Pimpinels</hi>
called <hi>Sanguisorbes,</hi> but to that other sort
called <hi>Saxifraga's,</hi> amongst them to these
called <hi>Major Vmbella, Candida,</hi> or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with the <hi>white boss,</hi> or <hi>Tuft,</hi> to which
it approacheth very near. But again it
doth differ from it; <hi>First,</hi> In the <hi>Native
Soil,</hi> or place of its growth: for <hi>Blew
Pimpinels</hi> grow in a <hi>blackish Earth,</hi> but
the other in a <hi>sandy. Secondly,</hi> The root
of <hi>Blew Pimpinels</hi> is outwardly of a gray
colour, and inwardly is white: the
other root is white both without and
within. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These roots do abound
within with a <hi>blewish juice,</hi> which is
never seen in the common sort, for which
cause it hath seem'd convenient to me to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52901:36"/>
give it the name of <hi>Blew Saxifrage Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinel.</hi>

the best way of all is, with <hi>Oleaginous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The distillation in these Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
is not to be too gentle, for then
the Liquor will be <hi>white,</hi> but a little <hi>brisk,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This <hi>Blew colour</hi> (as you may
observe in the two former Experiments)
is not so very lasting, but that after <hi>three

                  <p>

               <p>BY reason of the difficulties, and length

both by the Ancient <hi>Greek,</hi> as well
as <hi>Latine Authors,</hi> many uncertain, and
also <hi>fabulous</hi> things concerning <hi>Cinnamon.</hi>
And from hence, heretofore there hath
sprang so many controversies amongst

of <hi>Cinnamon,</hi> and <hi>Cannella;</hi> which
quarrels will be easily determined by
reading of the writings of latter <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The most noble sort of <hi>Cinnamon</hi> is the
<hi>Cannella Zeilanica,</hi> or the <hi>Cinnamon of Zei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan:</hi>
the next to this, is that of <hi>Malaver,</hi>
or <hi>Iava:</hi> the next is, the <hi>Peruvian.</hi> Nor
must we pass by the <hi>Clove Cinnamon,</hi> or
<hi>Clove Bark,</hi> so called from its tast, which
in this Age begins to be brought to us
from the <hi>Southern Provinces of America,</hi>
called <hi>Guiana.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52901:39"/>
But the History of <hi>Cannella</hi> is above all
others most exactly described by <hi>Guliel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Piso,</hi> cap. 1. and 2. of his <hi>Mantissae
Aromaticae,</hi> which he hath described and
annexed to his splendid and neat work,
<hi>De Indiae utriusque re naturali atque Medica.</hi>
Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1658 at <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> I
confess I was not a little joyed when I
turning over this <hi>Volumn,</hi> first beheld the
<hi>Cut</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>intire Cinnamon Tree:</hi>
having been troubled at the negligence,
shall I say, or ignorance of the rest of
<hi>Herbarists,</hi> for almost every one of them
in their <hi>Commentaries,</hi> have hardly afforded
us but one Leaf, with a Berry, with a
small Pipe, or Stem. Moreover, because
this <hi>Author,</hi> as <hi>Iohan. Iohnstonus</hi> (who
follows his steps in his <hi>Hist. Nat. de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boribus,</hi>)
is not to be found in every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
hands, and that besides there is hardly
any hope left, that this Tree will ever
be procured to grow in our colder Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat:
Therefore we esteem so much of
this <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and most fragrant <hi>Spice,</hi>
that being led by the example of <hi>Piso,</hi>
I have caused its <hi>Effigies</hi> to be ingraved,
and that it might be the better known to
our Countrymen, have taken care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
it in this place.</p>

But that we may draw nearer to what
we design, there is made of this Bark a
<hi>Water</hi> to be had in the Shops; which if
you reckon to be the first of <hi>Aromatical,</hi>
or spicy ones, you will not be mistaken;
for it is so <hi>cordial</hi> and friendly to the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits,</hi> and doth so powerfully expel
<hi>Wind</hi> in the <hi>Stomack</hi> and <hi>Guts,</hi> and also
is so grateful, and pleasing to the <hi>Palate,</hi>
that it leaves other Spices much behind
it. They are wont to distil it with Wine,
or without with <hi>Borage Water:</hi> either
way that which first distils over the <hi>Alim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi>
is of a <hi>Milky colour.</hi> But this Milki<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness
is hardly native, or true, but doth
proceed from the Oyl, with which this
Spice doth abound: which being dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the <hi>Water</hi> in small <hi>Particles,</hi>
causeth a <hi>Milky colour:</hi> And if these, as
it were <hi>Atomes,</hi> shall by length of time
be united, they will be carried to the
<hi>top</hi> of the <hi>Liquor,</hi> and there will shew
themselves small <hi>Oyly drops</hi> of a <hi>Golden
colour,</hi> leaving the Water clear: although
that Oyl, if it be somewhat more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
doth usually at last fall to the
bottom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:52901:40"/>
Nor ought this so to be interpreted,
as if this milky Colour were only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to <hi>Cinamon water:</hi> for it appeareth
also in the <hi>Water of Cloves, Nutmegs,</hi>
and the rest of waters drawn from Spices.
But I thought fit to name <hi>Cinamon</hi> above
the rest, because, as we said a little before,
it doth excel other <hi>Waters.</hi> And also,
because it is more frequently used every
where.</p>

Shrub, which drawn to the top of the Water
growth hard presently, and swims, and as
it is incompassed with aire it concretes, or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
Much of it is found in a Promontory
by</hi> Syracuse. <hi>The name of which is</hi> Pachyno.
<hi>The most commended is the Red sort, of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a Daffidil stalk, or of the deep coloured</hi>
Sardix <hi>or</hi> Orient bright Purple. <hi>Being of
a long and round figure easy to break, and of
a like hardness in every part of it: again, it is
of the scent of Oreweed, or Sea-grass. It is
very full of small branches, and is like in form to

the Shrub Cinamon.</hi> The like description to
this <hi>Pliny</hi> hath <hi>lib. 32. Histo. Natur.</hi> but
that he erroneously alledgeth that these
Berries or litle Balls, which are worn for
ornament about <hi>womans Necks,</hi> do grow
of their own accord on this small <hi>Sea tree:</hi>

they are made by Turning; and that also
might as well have been known heretofore.

               <p>Concerning this bright sparkling Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
whether or no the true tincture of its
genuine Colour, can be extracted, hath
been already examined: The <hi>Solutions</hi>

                  <p>Also this following is a compendious
way. Take of <hi>Red Corrals three ounces,</hi>

due to the Corrals: but is more owing
to the <hi>Spirit of Salt, Salt of Vinegar,

of it also to long digestions. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

                  <head>Observations relating to effervescency, and
incalescency, or production of heat.</head>
                  <p>To begin with those things best known:
It is well known to the common people,
that if Water be sprinkled upon <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lime,</hi>
it will excite from it both <hi>heat,</hi> and
<hi>smoke:</hi> which <hi>Operation</hi> is by <hi>Brick-layers,</hi>
and <hi>Plaisterers</hi> called <hi>slaking,</hi> or <hi>extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Lime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If you moisten with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> the
filings of <hi>Iron, Copper,</hi> or <hi>Tinn,</hi> the Glass
in which it is done will grow so <hi>hot,</hi> that
you can scarce hold it in your <hi>hand,</hi> there
also ascending at the same time plenty of
<hi>Fumes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Almost the like effect doth follow,
if you poure the <hi>Caustick Water</hi> upon
<hi>Quicksilver, Lead,</hi> or <hi>Marcasite.</hi> But as
to what relates to the more perfect <hi>Metals;
Luna,</hi> or Silver, doth stronglier resist <hi>Aqua-Fortis,</hi>
than the imperfect Metals are wont
to do: but <hi>Gold</hi> doth plainly elude its
force, except <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> be added.</p>
                  <p>4. You may also observe an exagitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if you pour <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> upon <hi>Salt</hi> of
<hi>Tartar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Pour Fountain Water upon calcined
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52901:45"/>
                     <hi>Vitriol,</hi> whilst it is yet <hi>warm,</hi> stirring it
softly; and you shall perceive it to wax
vehemently hot. The same will happen
if you pour <hi>Water</hi> upon any <hi>Alcalizate,</hi> or
fixed <hi>Salt</hi> whilst it is yet hot.</p>
                  <p>6. Distil drop by drop of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Vitriol,</hi> into the <hi>Salt,</hi> or the <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi>
prepared <hi>per deliquium,</hi> and there will be
caused a <hi>crackling noise:</hi> which being fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
there will appear a <hi>coagulum</hi> which
is commonly called <hi>Tartarus Vitriolatus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Mix the same <hi>acid Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> or
of <hi>Sulphur</hi> with the <hi>Gall</hi> of an <hi>Ox</hi> (which
is fill'd with its own native <hi>Vrinous Salt,</hi>)
and you will presently perceive them to
fight. But the ebullition will be much
stronger, if you mix <hi>Gall</hi> with <hi>Aqua-fortis:</hi>
insomuch that a great disturbance will
follow it, and a <hi>White froath</hi> will arise a
great height upon it.</p>
                  <p>8. If the Genuine <hi>Red Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> and
<hi>Spirit of Turpentine</hi> be mixed together; the
Glass doth begin to wax so very hot, that
it cannot be touched by naked hands.</p>
                  <p>9. Neither doth the Spirit of <hi>Salt Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi>
or <hi>Peter</hi> will agree with the <hi>butter of
Antimony,</hi> but these two <hi>Liquors</hi> being
mixed together, are seen rather like <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
to fight between themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:52901:46"/>
10. I had lately reserved for a use, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of common Salt,</hi> and after it was consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
I put into the Glass (perhaps
whilst it was yet moist) <hi>Spirit of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi>
tincted with the <hi>Flowers of Brass,</hi>
(which many now a days call the <hi>Saphirine
Spirit</hi>) I observed when I poured it in,
immediately the <hi>first drop</hi> stirred up a <hi>Cloud</hi>
in the <hi>Glass,</hi> and a <hi>Smoakie Vapour</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
exhale from it. A not obscure
Argument, that these two Spirits were
almost insociable, upon the account of
their <hi>contrary Salts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. <hi>To this place belongs the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of</hi> Regnerus de Graff. <hi>in his Book</hi> de Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co
Pancreatico, pag. 60. <hi>which he lays down
to this sence:</hi> We took, says he, Oyl of Tartar
per deliquium and we poured it into Cows Milk,
after which we added a small quantity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Vitriol, and presently there arose an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervescence,
and that of longer continuance,
than if Milk had not been added. Which
differency seems to depend upon the viscidity
of the Milk: this effervescence will not proceed
so well, if you put the Spirit of Vitriol into the
Milk before you put in the Oyl of Tartar, (<hi>to
wit,</hi>) because of its aptness to be coagulated
by the Acid.</p>

                  <head>Observations of Attenuation, and of
Coagulation.</head>
                  <p>1. We call <hi>Attenuation,</hi> when a <hi>solid</hi> and
<hi>Gross Body,</hi> is rendred <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>fluid:</hi> but
the contrary to this is called to <hi>inspissat,</hi>
thicken, or <hi>coagulate,</hi> when such things
which of themselves are <hi>fluid,</hi> and <hi>thin,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>firmness</hi> and <hi>subsistence,</hi> and are <hi>thickned,</hi>
either by the means of <hi>Coagulation,</hi> or <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciescency,</hi>
(that is, <hi>freezed</hi> or made <hi>Ice</hi>) or
else altogether <hi>Lapidificated,</hi> or turned
into Stone; which <hi>Physical,</hi> or natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
above all others are most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
known not only in the <hi>Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Shops,</hi> but also in other <hi>Mechanical
Arts:</hi> wherefore the whole <hi>Spagirical Art</hi>
is by many believed to receive its name
from <hi>dissolving</hi> and <hi>congregating,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacting
together, for which reason these
two qualities (in our opinion) justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a peculiar consideration.</p>
                  <p>2. When the <hi>Apothecary</hi> prepares <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions,</hi>
or <hi>Infusions,</hi> and <hi>the Cook</hi> makes
<hi>fresh Broth,</hi> by pouring on of <hi>Liquids:</hi> gross
and <hi>dense</hi> bodies are <hi>attenuated,</hi> and their
nobler parts extracted. There is the
like reason in <hi>Iuleps,</hi> or <hi>emulsions,</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52901:47"/>
the rest of Medicines in a Liquid
form.</p>
                  <p>3. Thus we see the bodies of all dry
<hi>Salts,</hi> are melted and <hi>attenuated,</hi> by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
watry Liquors upon them: From
whence those <hi>Solutions</hi> called the <hi>simple
ones,</hi> of which sort for <hi>Example</hi> is that of
<hi>Vitriol</hi> dissolved into <hi>Fountain Water,</hi>
which being mixed with the infusion of
<hi>Galls</hi> produceth <hi>Ink,</hi> of which mention
is made above in <hi>chap.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>4. Relating to this purpose are all the
<hi>corrosive Solutions</hi> made by <hi>Caustick Waters,</hi>
upon the solid <hi>compage</hi> of <hi>Metals.</hi> For
<hi>Gold</hi> by its smallest parts doth swim in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Regia,</hi> so that, that which if left to it
self stops the sharpest sight from looking
into, it presently changeth its <hi>Species,</hi> and
<hi>Texture,</hi> and appears <hi>diaphanous,</hi> or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</p>
                  <p>5. Nor is it less to be wondred at, that
the same <hi>Gold,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Metals</hi>
will suffer themselves to be so <hi>attenuated</hi>
by the <hi>Fire,</hi> (by as it were a certain <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosion</hi>)
that they will flow like <hi>Waves</hi> of
<hi>Water:</hi> which <hi>fusion</hi> truly, unless the thing
were so common as it is, would hardly
be believed by such as were ignorant of
it.</p>

6. <hi>Alablaster,</hi> and <hi>Gypsum,</hi> or Plaister
of <hi>Paris,</hi> may be burned as they do <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi>
as is commonly known; and it is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
asserted by <hi>Anselmus Boetius, lib.
2. de Lapid &amp; Gemm. cap.</hi> 269. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no the following <hi>Experiment</hi> be
much noted, I know not, (and therefore
will set it down) Cast into a vessel of
<hi>Brass,</hi> or <hi>Iron</hi> with a Flat botom, <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaster,</hi>
or in stead of it <hi>Plaister of Paris,</hi>
(very finely grown'd, and sifted) <hi>some

even to the utmost height. And you shall
see this <hi>Stony Powder</hi> to put on the <hi>form</hi> of
a <hi>Liquor,</hi> and to boyl like <hi>Waves,</hi> sending
up <hi>White Vapours,</hi> resembling <hi>Smoak;</hi>
moreover if you then stir it with a <hi>Stick,</hi>
you will not find it to resist the motion of
your <hi>hand,</hi> like <hi>Sand,</hi> but to yeild like
<hi>Liquor:</hi> which thing truly doth produce
no small delight, to the <hi>curious Spectator,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> doth witness of himself, in his
<hi>History</hi> of <hi>Fluidity, Sect.</hi> 18. where he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
more <hi>notes,</hi> and cautions upon this
thing.</p>
                  <p>7. It is also a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of a <hi>species</hi> of
<hi>attenuation,</hi> by which <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
into a Liquor <hi>per deliquium:</hi> And
amongst <hi>Natures works,</hi> it is an <hi>Illustrious
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52901:48"/>
Attenuation,</hi> by which the thickest <hi>Ice</hi> of
<hi>Rivers</hi> in the <hi>Spring</hi> time is dissolved by
the heat of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. But that we may also come to the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> or appearances of <hi>Coagulation,</hi>
amongst those which are best known is
that of making <hi>Bread,</hi> whilst the <hi>Bakers</hi>
by mixing <hi>Water</hi> with Flower or <hi>Meal
coagulate</hi> it into a Mass, to make <hi>Bread</hi> out
of. The like, but more compounded
work, is that of the <hi>Confectioner,</hi> who mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
together <hi>Butter, Sugar, Egs,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other ingredients.</p>
                  <p>9. But there is hardly extant a more
<hi>domestick,</hi> or familiar <hi>Example,</hi> than the
<hi>coagulation</hi> of <hi>Milk,</hi> whether it be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by <hi>Calves,</hi> or <hi>Lambs Runnit,</hi> or by
<hi>juice of Limons,</hi> or by <hi>sowre Herbs, Spirit
of Vitriol,</hi> or other <hi>acid Salt:</hi> by which
means the fluid substance of the <hi>Milk</hi> sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
it self from the <hi>whey,</hi> and suddenly
joyns together into a <hi>cheesy Mass.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. In the <hi>Canary Islands</hi> they
thicken, (by boyling) the fluid juice of
<hi>Canes and Reeds</hi> into innumerably useful,
and most sweet <hi>Sugar:</hi> And on the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
in the <hi>Island of Succotra,</hi> they make
<hi>Aloes</hi> of the <hi>juice</hi> of a <hi>Plant,</hi> which is so
exceeding bitter that it is become a nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52901:48"/>
for other bitter things: <hi>[You will
have a large account of coagulations of
this nature in the</hi> Philosophical Essay of
Petrification, <hi>written by the Translator of
this Treatise, and printed</hi> Anno 1672.]
Nay without Art, or Labour, <hi>Water</hi> is

And to omit other Countrys, the <hi>Cave</hi>
called <hi>Baumanus</hi>'s <hi>Cave,</hi> not far from the

<hi>Waters</hi> are turned into <hi>stony Icicles,</hi> but
also there is found a wonderful company
of the Bones of <hi>Animals,</hi> but from what
<hi>Original,</hi> or how they came there, is yet
uncertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleventhly.</hi> But as to what concerns
<hi>Minerals.</hi> If you mix the best <hi>Vrinous
Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> equal parts, with
the most dephlegm'd <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> they
will set, or fall to the bottom of the Glass
in the manner of <hi>Icy flakes,</hi> or rather like
<hi>Snow.</hi> For whilst the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the
<hi>Armoniack Spirit</hi> is blunted and mitigated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
by the sweetness of the <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> the
<hi>crisped,</hi> and sharp pointed Particles of the
<hi>Salt</hi> falling to the bottom, and others
falling still upon them, they represent the
form of <hi>Snow.</hi>

mixed with the <hi>Acid Spirit of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi>
(not with the <hi>Salt</hi> Urinous one)
then at first the mixture will grow <hi>hot,</hi>
and presently it will be <hi>troubled,</hi> and <hi>thick,</hi>
and at length it will begin to conjoyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
plainly in the form of <hi>Butter.</hi>

                  <p>

equal parts of highly rectified <hi>Spirit of
Wine,</hi> and exquisitely <hi>dephlegm'd Spirit of
Vrine,</hi> they will coagulate (by agitating
them) in a quarter of an hours time:
<hi>first,</hi> into the form of <hi>Snow,</hi> and a little
after, into a <hi>solid Mass.</hi> But unless both
the <hi>Spirits</hi> be freed from all <hi>Phlegm,</hi> this
business will want success: As Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi>
doth prudently admonish in his <hi>History

                     </hi>
and then form it into little <hi>Balls,</hi> the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>Pease.</hi> These little <hi>Balls</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to a temperate Air, after a few
hours, will harden of then own accord:
But if you have a mind also to induce a
<hi>colour</hi> upon this <hi>coagulated Mercury,</hi> then
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52901:50"/>
take of <hi>Turmerick roots fourteen Drams,</hi> and
of prepar'd <hi>Tutia one ounce,</hi> and mixing
them together, make with the <hi>Balls Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
super Stratum,</hi> that is, one row of
the <hi>Powders,</hi> and another of the <hi>Balls,</hi>
and so do till you have filled up a <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
which <hi>lute</hi> well, that nothing may
expire. Let it stand at first in a <hi>gentle
fire,</hi> that the matter may dry: afterwards
for an <hi>hour</hi> or more, apply a <hi>strong fire</hi> to
it; then take it off, and after it is <hi>cold,
melt it</hi> as they use to do <hi>Metals,</hi> and pour
it into an <hi>Ingot,</hi> and you will have a <hi>Mass</hi>
very much resembling <hi>Rhenish Gold,</hi> of
which may be made <hi>Rings, Bracelets</hi> and
<hi>Medals.</hi> If there be any body that will
not allow this Mass any longer to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of the <hi>Quicksilver,</hi> I will not contest
with him; because others which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with that <hi>Planet,</hi> will not be
induced easily to believe, that it can free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endure a vehement fire for an hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                  <head>Observations upon Blood, and its Serum.</head>
                  <p>How much the <hi>Blood within</hi> is altered,
by <hi>attenuating,</hi> or <hi>coagulating</hi> it, by means
of <hi>Mineral Spirits injected</hi> into the Veins
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52901:50"/>
of <hi>Brutes,</hi> hath long since been declared
by us, in <hi>Clysmatica Nova,</hi> cap. 5.</p>
                  <p>But, moreover, we have tryed many
things upon <hi>Humane blood</hi> whilst it was
yet <hi>warm,</hi> and newly drawn out of the
<hi>Veins</hi> by <hi>Phlebotomy:</hi> observing that by
instilling those <hi>Mineral Spirits,</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi>
hath undergone various mutations: of
which kind are <hi>Ebullitions,</hi> (or boyling,
and bubling,) <hi>Attenuation,</hi> (or becomming
thinner,) <hi>grumescence,</hi> curdling or coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the <hi>exaltation</hi> or heightning
of its <hi>colour,</hi> or the <hi>obscuration,</hi> darkning
or hiding of it, and many the like varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But before <hi>Humane blood,</hi> let out
by opening a <hi>Vein,</hi> do lose its <hi>heat,</hi> and
begin to thicken, there useth to swim
upon it a <hi>Liquor,</hi> heretofore taken for
<hi>Bile,</hi> or <hi>Choler,</hi> now esteemed its <hi>Serum,</hi>
or <hi>Whey.</hi> Certainly it is not so bitter
that it can deserve the name of <hi>Gall,</hi> or
<hi>Choler:</hi> neither is it so <hi>thin</hi> that it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
deserves to be called <hi>Whey,</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
If it be taken up gently in a <hi>Silver
Spoon,</hi> and without the mixture of the
bloody substance, if it be held a little
while over warm <hi>Embers</hi> or <hi>Coals,</hi> it will
be <hi>coagulated</hi> like to the <hi>white of an Egg</hi>
boyl'd, both as to its <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>colour,</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52901:51"/>
and is also almost like it in <hi>taste.</hi> As to
what concerns its <hi>colour,</hi> I have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of this difference; that in many it
is perfectly <hi>white,</hi> in others it is <hi>palish,</hi> in
others it tendeth towards <hi>yellowness:</hi>
which variety may depend either from
the <hi>temperament,</hi> or from the <hi>healthy,</hi> and
<hi>infirm state</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> or from those
things which are received into the Body,
(for it appeareth that some portion of
the <hi>Chyle</hi> is not changed altogether into
Blood.)</p>
                  <p>If you put in of the aforesaid <hi>Mineral
Spirits</hi> by <hi>drops</hi> upon this <hi>Chylous Serum</hi>
put into several Vessels, there will also
appear various <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which will be
useful for a careful Physician to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of. In these kind of examinations,
our very much honour'd Collegiate, that
excellent man Dr. <hi>Godfredus Leisnerus,</hi>
when he was living, did lately take much
pains, who himself writ these following
<hi>Observations,</hi> and a little before he yielded
to <hi>Fate,</hi> communicated them to me to be
divulged in this place.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>N. N.</hi> by birth of <hi>Clive,</hi> of thirty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52901:51"/>
years of age, he was <hi>Scorbutick,</hi> had red
<hi>Spots,</hi> and <hi>Pustils</hi> in his <hi>Face,</hi> a heaviness and
weariness in his <hi>Ioints,</hi> and a <hi>numness,</hi>
a flushing in his <hi>Face</hi> after drinking <hi>strong
Wine,</hi> or <hi>strong Beer,</hi> or the <hi>Swalbasher
Spaw Water,</hi> and was obnoxious to <hi>bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gums,</hi> and the like; after having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
<hi>Pills</hi> upon the 28 day of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1671.
He was <hi>let Blood</hi> in the <hi>left Arm,</hi> and had
about <hi>seven Ounces</hi> taken from him, in
<hi>three Porringers.</hi> The Blood was very hot
in its flowing forth: the day before he
had drank <hi>Wine</hi> largely, after which he
was <hi>cold,</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> had much <hi>Serum,</hi> and
the <hi>grumous</hi> and curdled parts were very
red, and would easily be divided by a
<hi>Twig;</hi> in the <hi>bottom</hi> it was of a <hi>bright Bay
colour,</hi> the <hi>Serum</hi> poured off, was of the
<hi>colour of Lee,</hi> like <hi>Vrine</hi> of a <hi>Citron colour</hi>
tending to <hi>red:</hi> It was divided into <hi>twelve
Dishes,</hi> and the Liquors being mixed with
it, things appeared thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> With <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> dropt on it,
it presently <hi>coagulated</hi> into a substance like
<hi>cheese,</hi> from the <hi>top</hi> to the <hi>bottom</hi> of the
<hi>Liquor,</hi> in that <hi>space</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> was dropt
into: This <hi>Curd</hi> was <hi>white</hi> on the <hi>top,</hi>
but towards the bottom <hi>yellow</hi> like <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
the rest of the <hi>Serum</hi> swimming about
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52901:52"/>
it was clear, but dropping in <hi>Spirit of
Nitre</hi> it also became of a <hi>Cheesy substance;</hi>
some of the <hi>Liquor</hi> which remained, poured
out clear like water, upon inclining of the
Vessel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>sweet Spirit of Nitre</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drop'd on, made no alteration; but
after a short time, the upper half of the
<hi>Liquor</hi> grew altogether clear, but the lower
half was a little troubled, yet so, that
there could scarce any difference be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
but by <hi>curious Chymical eyes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, Spirit of Salt</hi> did presently
<hi>pervade</hi> the <hi>Liquor,</hi> not only in that <hi>place</hi>
where it was <hi>drop'd in,</hi> but through the
whole circumference of the <hi>Liquor,</hi> and
about the bottom <hi>precipitated</hi> a <hi>white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulum,</hi>
but not <hi>stiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>sweet Spirit of Salt</hi> did
trouble the <hi>Liquor</hi> a little, but in a short
time there was a separation made like the
<hi>cream of Milk,</hi> which swam at the top.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly, Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> did precipitate
a <hi>White Curd</hi> equally from all parts to the
<hi>bottom,</hi> almost <hi>Analogous</hi> to the <hi>curd</hi> made
with the <hi>sweet Spirit of Salt,</hi> but thinner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly, Aqua-fortis</hi> did altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> both in the
<hi>whiteness</hi> of the <hi>Curd,</hi> its <hi>yellowish bottom,</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52901:52"/>
and the <hi>clearness</hi> of the Liquor which was
left uncoagulated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly, Spirit of Sulphur,</hi> converted
the whole Liquor into a <hi>white coagulum,</hi>
or Curd, except a few <hi>drops</hi> which were
left.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eightly,</hi> The <hi>Clyssus</hi> (or the <hi>Sulphureous
acid Spirit of Antimony</hi>) being dropped
in, precipitated to the bottom of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>
a Curd, which was on one side <hi>White,</hi>
and <hi>Cheesy,</hi> and on the other side transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and like a <hi>Ielly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ninthly, Arcanum Nitri</hi> (that is the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of the <hi>Salt</hi> of the <hi>caput Mortuum</hi> of
<hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or its red Earth left in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the <hi>Retort</hi>) dropped in, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
it did presently fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the <hi>Liquor</hi> in which it was put:
nor would it be mixed with it, so that it
might be very well discerned from it, but
after an hour or two, the <hi>Liquor</hi> was of an
<hi>bigher Colour,</hi> and there settled in the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi>
of the <hi>Vessel</hi> a troubled <hi>Sediment,</hi>
which upon slightly shaking of the <hi>Glass</hi>
united again with the <hi>Liquor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tenthly,</hi> The <hi>Salt Spirit of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi>
did introduce no alteration at all in
the <hi>Liquor,</hi> neither in its <hi>Colour,</hi> nor in its
<hi>consistence.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> The <hi>fixed Liquor of Nitre,</hi>
did thicken and trouble this <hi>Liquor,</hi> and
precipitated to the bottom a certain <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Curd,</hi> the Liquor which swam at the
<hi>top</hi> was very clear.</p>

there was taken from him about <hi>eight
Ounces of Blood.</hi> The grumous <hi>Blood</hi> was
of a <hi>florid Colour, Thin,</hi> and had much
<hi>Serum,</hi> which being poured out into little
<hi>dishes,</hi> it brought off with it from the top
of the <hi>Blood</hi> a little <hi>redness,</hi> this subsided

                     <p>3. <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> did the same, but with
this difference, that the <hi>Coagulum</hi> was
more <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> on the <hi>top</hi> of it, and as
it were a <hi>Ielley.</hi>

4. The <hi>Sweet Spirit of Salt,</hi> did the

<hi>Cream</hi> was <hi>thicker.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Spirit of Sulphur</hi> made a Coagulum
like <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> but a little <hi>thinner,</hi> and
more like <hi>Ielley.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. The <hi>Clyssus</hi> made a white and thick

                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>12. <hi>Spirit of Verdigrece,</hi> at the first drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

                        <hi>Serum,</hi> into which the following things
were dropped.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> from which there was a
<hi>cheesy</hi> and white concretion, the <hi>Serum</hi>
which swam at the top was pale; this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulum</hi>
was not dissolved, by dropping

                     </p>
                     <p>2. By the <hi>Clyssus</hi> there was made a <hi>white
Curd,</hi> which fell to the <hi>bottom,</hi> but was less
<hi>tenacious,</hi> or tough.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> made a Coagulum
like <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> in all things, and when
more Spirit was put in, the <hi>Serum</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all coagulated.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Sweet Spirit of Nitre,</hi> made no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
at all.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> did equally precipitate
a <hi>white Curd</hi> to the bottom, like a <hi>Ielly,</hi> and
of a <hi>pale Yellow Colour</hi> at the top, leaving a
Liquor that was somewhat paler above it.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> did absolutely the
same thing, excepting that the Liquor
which swam at the top, did remain some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more tincted.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>Spirit of Verdigrece</hi> made no change

                     </p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Polemanus's double Spirit,</hi> did the same

with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> excepting that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulum
was a little thicker, and less
white.</p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Arcanum Nitri,</hi> made a troubled

no alteration appeared. Into this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there being dropped one or two
drops of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> it produced a <hi>milkie
curd</hi> after the usual manner.</p>
                     <p>11. The Liquor of fixed <hi>Nitre</hi> also
made a troubled bottom, and shaking the

dropping in <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> there was an ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
made, and much <hi>Spume,</hi> or Forth
raised of a <hi>Sulphureous colour,</hi> but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
nothing was precipitated.</p>
                     <p>12. <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> prepared

Liquor, but only a little heighten the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi>
a drop or two of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> being
added to this, presently made a milky
curd: but a greater quantity of <hi>Spirit of

<hi>N. N.</hi> after he had spit blood for some
years, fell into a spitting of Matter, with
an inordinate or irregular Feaver, after
exhibiting of Medicines, and chiefly of
<hi>Adstringents,</hi> the thirtieth day of <hi>May</hi> he
fell into a large <hi>Haemoptisis,</hi> or spitting of
blood, he having been afflicted before it
with a weightiness, and weariness of his

florid <hi>blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> which was easily coagulated.
The <hi>2d</hi> day of <hi>August</hi> after Midnight, his
spitting of <hi>blood</hi> was very urgent, only he
perceived his <hi>blood</hi> which he threw up to
be hotter whilst it was in his <hi>mouth:</hi> it
was neither <hi>putrid</hi> matter, nor <hi>Salt</hi> as
heretofore. I commanded to take about
four <hi>ounces</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> by opening a Vein
in the <hi>Right Arm.</hi> The <hi>Blood</hi> which was
let out was taken in two <hi>Silver Dishes,</hi> and
appeared black even whilst it was flowing
forth: it had little <hi>Serum,</hi> scarce two <hi>drams,</hi>
and that of a <hi>Yellow Colour.</hi> The clotted
blood had a florid red circle about it, the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52901:55"/>
middle part was like the skin of a Jelly. To
this <hi>blood,</hi> being well dryed with spongy
Brown Paper, these following things were
applyed.</p>
                     <p>1. One drop of <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> did
presently and sooner than in the twinkling
of an <hi>Eye,</hi> impress a white spot upon it,
and that not superficially, but sufficiently
deep, and very white.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>Sweet Spirit of Nitre,</hi> made no
change at all.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Spirit of Salt,</hi> did more slowly make
a spot, and that less white, and less deep.
The red <hi>Circle</hi> of the <hi>blood</hi> it self, and the
circumference of the drop, were both
black.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Sweet Spirit of Salt,</hi> at the first did
nothing, but after it had stood sometime
upon the <hi>Liquor</hi> it did a little dissolve the
outward <hi>skin</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> and made a
hole in it, and rendred the blood under
it, (in which it was contained) of a <hi>livid
flesh Colour,</hi> spotted like Marble.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> did slowly make a
spot a little <hi>whitish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> did swiftly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
(with some Fume) make a spot
altogether agreeable with that of <hi>Spirit of
Nitre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:52901:56"/>
7. Spirit of Sulphur, <hi>made a</hi> Spot <hi>like
that of</hi> Spirit of Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>8. The <hi>Clyssus</hi> produced a white spot.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Spirit of Verdigrece</hi> as to its effect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
with the <hi>Sweet Spirit of Salt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. <hi>Arcanum Nitri</hi> stood upon the
Blood in its own circumference, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it made a yellowish spot, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the <hi>skin</hi> of the Blood thinner, so that
it might easily be divided by a twig.</p>
                     <p>11. <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> made no
change, or spot.</p>
                     <p>12. The Liquor of <hi>Fixed Nitre</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the <hi>Blood</hi> much <hi>Redder</hi> and transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>

               <head>Noble and most Experient Sir,
my Collegiate, and most
Honoured Friend.</head>
               <p>YOu demanding that I would cast
in some of my Chymical Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
to be added to your <hi>curious
Distillatory,</hi> (by reason of the great
Friendship which hath been betwixt us
from our Youth,) I could not deny it:
although I always desired, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have lain hid, than to have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
writing either upon my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
or with others. But omitting
an infinite Number which seem to
look towards your second chapter, I
will therefore communicate only one
<hi>Observation</hi> of my <hi>Chymical</hi> labours,
about a certain Stone, which from the
place of its growth, I call the <hi>Grun-Walden-Stone.</hi>
It was found here
hard by <hi>Berlin,</hi> by my self, and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wend</hi>
the <hi>Goldsmith</hi> (who is yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving)
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52901:57"/>
                  <hi>Anno.</hi> 1663. in the Month
of <hi>May,</hi> near the <hi>Wood</hi> commonly
called <hi>der Grunwald,</hi> by the
help of a <hi>Shepherds Boy,</hi> who knew
the place, and shewed it to us. This
Stone contains of <hi>Metals, Iron,</hi> and
<hi>Copper:</hi> and of <hi>Metalline Juices,
Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which are hid
in a <hi>Golden Markasite,</hi> with which
this Stone abounds. This <hi>Markasite</hi>
therefore (which the <hi>Greeks</hi> calls <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites)</hi>
I separated from the rest of the
Stone, and having reduced it into
Powder, dissolved as much of it as I
could in <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi> I put the
Solution in Sand to evaporate, and
there remained in the bottom a matter
that was fine, spongy, and of a <hi>yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowish
Sulphur Colour.</hi> Upon several
parts of this matter I poured,</p>
               <p>1. Some <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> that I
might dissolve, and digest it: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
all became immediately exceeding
<hi>Black.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52901:58"/>
2. Upon another part of this <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
I dropt <hi>Oyl,</hi> or <hi>Liquor of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
in some quantity, and presently
there was a crackling noise, and ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and there was induced upon it a
bay <hi>Colour,</hi> but <hi>thick,</hi> and <hi>obscure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. This Liquor being <hi>Philtred,</hi> I
mixed the <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> with
it, and there emerged a most lovely
<hi>Scarlet blood Colour,</hi> splendid like
a <hi>Ruby,</hi> and <hi>transparent,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the bottom a gross, and
black Sediment.</p>
               <p>4. To this <hi>Ruby-coloured Liquor</hi>
I added some drops of a Solution of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
made with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and
sooner than you can speak it, the <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Silver</hi> was coagulated upon the
<hi>Liquor,</hi> into a <hi>Curd</hi> as <hi>white as
Snow,</hi> and was like Fat, or the <hi>white</hi>
of an <hi>Egg</hi> boyl'd hard, which after a
little time fell down white to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
like <hi>Lime;</hi> the <hi>Liquor</hi> retaining
its <hi>Scarlet blood Colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:52901:58"/>
5. After I had abstracted this
lovely <hi>Ruby-coloured Liquor</hi> almost
to dryness, there remained in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
a <hi>snowy Salt, Lanceolated</hi> or
Chrystallized like <hi>Nitre.</hi> I poured
upon these Chrystals clear <hi>Spring Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and they were most easily dissolved
in it, and the Liquor was <hi>clear, Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi>
and <hi>Transparent</hi> even like fair
Water. But when I added to it the
<hi>Oyl</hi> or <hi>Liquor</hi> of <hi>common Tartar,</hi>
immediately the former <hi>Scarlet blood-Colour</hi>
returned again.</p>
               <p>6. I have a <hi>Liquor</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with an <hi>Hungarian Gold Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi>
of this <hi>Oyl,</hi> or <hi>Liquor,</hi> when I
put in a few drops, the whole Liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a <hi>blewish green Colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. I took again also of the aforesaid
<hi>Scarlet Blood-Coloured Liquor</hi> one
<hi>ounce</hi> or there abouts, and to it added
onely one drop of the <hi>Solution of Gold,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:52901:59"/>
made with <hi>Aqua Regis:</hi> &amp; in less then
a moment the whole Liquor of this love<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Red Sanguine Colour,</hi> was changed
into a <hi>Goldish Yellow Colour,</hi> such
as the <hi>Solution</hi> of the <hi>Gold</hi> was
like that <hi>Kingly Star</hi> the <hi>Sun, discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and filling all things
with his commanding light.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I here omit many more
<hi>Chymical Phaenomena,</hi> wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Stone, which have slipped out
of my mind: as also a <hi>Menstruum</hi>
which turned that blood-coloured Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
presently into clear, and <hi>Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi>
Water; and another <hi>Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
which turned the same Liquor
into a <hi>Violet-Colour;</hi> and others
which transform'd it into other <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</hi>
I yet keep by me a <hi>Sky-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi>
Powder prepared of this Stone,
which in its fairness is not exceeded by
the <hi>Mountain Blew,</hi> or Sky colour,
called <hi>Bergblau.</hi> For I confess
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52901:59"/>
there are no kind of true <hi>Colours</hi>
which <hi>Painters</hi> do make use of; which
do not in my opinion result from the
<hi>Calxs</hi> of <hi>Metals</hi> or <hi>Minerals</hi> vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
prepared. I send together with
these a piece of this <hi>Grun-walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Stone,</hi>
that so if you please you your
self may experiment the before recited
<hi>Phaenomena.</hi> I have also sent a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>wonderful Violet colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Powder,</hi> so called by <hi>Geber</hi> the
<hi>Arabian</hi> in his <hi>Summa Perfectionis.
Cap. 28. lib.</hi> 1. Which I obtained
from <hi>Copper</hi> calcin'd with <hi>Sulphur,</hi>
about three days since. By way of
Conclusion I add, an Experiment
which happened to me concerning that
<hi>Bilious Liquor,</hi> contained in the
bladder of Gall: In this (above twenty
years since,) I dissolved some <hi>Aloes
Rosatum,</hi> or depurated <hi>Aloes,</hi> and
the <hi>Green Colour</hi> of the <hi>Bile,</hi> or
<hi>Choler</hi> was changed into a true <hi>blood
Colour.</hi> The consideration of which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52901:60"/>
thing, cannot I suppose but be beneficial
to all Men, <hi>Farewell.</hi>

               <p>AFter that a little while since,

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52901:61"/>
me to read your <hi>Curious Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi>
(which now sweats under the

remember of my <hi>Chymical Labours,</hi>
an Experiment or two, which might
have some relation to the things you
treat of: And behold there came <hi>Two</hi>
into my <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, perhaps as well known
to your self, but not alledged in that
Elegant Writing of yours, if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
rightly: in both of them there
comes a <hi>Golden Colour</hi> over the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limbeck,</hi>
in one of them in the form
of a <hi>Spirituous Liquor,</hi> in the other of

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52901:61"/>
and cast into a certain instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by the help of an <hi>open Fire,</hi>
there is drawn that sufficiently cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<hi>Liquor against the Stone,</hi> by
many highly commended also against di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
obstructions, and impurities of the
Blood; which that it shines in its first
distillation with a <hi>Golden Colour</hi> will
hardly procure admiration to any one,
since it is a true Solution of the <hi>Salt</hi>
and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> expelled from these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Matters</hi> by the violence of the
<hi>Fire;</hi> as also no man wonders that
Spirit of common <hi>Salt</hi> is indued almost
with the same Colour; but if it be <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
by a <hi>Retort,</hi> with a moderate <hi>Fire,</hi>
it will be discovered how much <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
Salt</hi> it contained; and this <hi>rectified
Spirit of Salt,</hi> will be almost <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous,</hi>
and without <hi>Colour.</hi> But
concerning our almost <hi>Goldish Colour,</hi>
I have often taken notice that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifi'd
more than once yet it brings over
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52901:62"/>
with it self the <hi>goldish Tincture,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be not quite so deep as
before: which is a sign that the <hi>Salt</hi>
and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> are more intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
united, and under a <hi>Volatile
Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Other Observation</hi> which I
offer, is not so commonly known, nor
have I happened to read of it in the
<hi>writings</hi> of <hi>Chymists:</hi> every body
knows that baked or burnt <hi>Tiles</hi> are of
a reddish colour throughout, which <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi>
should any man have told me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
that it were separable from
them, I should have given as much
credit to it, as to those who contend
that the Tincture, or red Colour may
be separated from <hi>Corals;</hi> which as
to the <hi>Colour,</hi> as it is a <hi>Naked qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
I hold to be impossible; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of some certain proportion of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
matter (which I acknowledg to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52901:62"/>
be the chief Subject of this Colour)
which may be taken out of the <hi>Corals,</hi>
by certain <hi>Menstruums,</hi> to account
that thing impossible is neither well nor
true. It happned (as I have known by
experience) that the <hi>rusty,</hi> or rather
red <hi>Colour</hi> with which the <hi>Tyles</hi> are
tinged throughout, may be so separated
from them, that nothing of it will be
left, or remain in them. I was about
to prepare the <hi>Volatile Urinous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Sal Armoniack,</hi> and therefore
took, as the custom is, a <hi>Lixiviate
Alcaly</hi> in the preparation of it, by
which means I obtained a pound or
two of <hi>Salt,</hi> composed of both of them,
to wit, the <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and the <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack;</hi>
from which being desirous
to draw a <hi>Spirit,</hi> I did, after the most
usual Method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mix it with <hi>three times
its weight of Powder of Tyles,</hi> and
attempted to drive over the <hi>Spirit</hi> by a
<hi>Retort,</hi> in a <hi>naked Fire,</hi> but I did not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52901:63"/>
obtain what I would have had: for
there distilled but very little <hi>Liquor,</hi>
but at length there arose a <hi>Corporeal</hi>
and <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> in such proportion,
that it almost filled up the <hi>Neck of the
Retort,</hi> for which cause it would at
last break it of necessity; The <hi>Retort</hi>
therefore being taken out of the <hi>Fire,</hi>
I observed all the <hi>Salt</hi> to be sublimed
into the <hi>Neck</hi> and the upper part of the
<hi>Retort,</hi> and it was <hi>Tincted</hi> with a
<hi>Saffron Colour,</hi> and the <hi>Powder</hi> of
the <hi>Tiles</hi> which was left, was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all its <hi>Colour,</hi> and was like
Ashes. Which extracting of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
by an Alimbeck from a body
which had indured so great a stress
of Fire before,</hi> As it is an <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
