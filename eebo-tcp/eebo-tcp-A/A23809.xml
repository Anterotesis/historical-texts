         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>bout the fire as before, and a continual noise of Cat
heard all night, but never seen.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Tenant having in a Room a heap of
Malt and another of Vetches, the two percels were found
next morning exactly mingled together and put into a
new heap.</p>
            <p>Another time she had baked a Batch of Bread, and
laid the Loaves over night on a Table, next morning the
Loaves were all gone, and after search made, they were
found in another Room hid in Tubs and covered with
linnen Cloathes, and all this while the Tenant had the
keys of the doors in her pocket, and found the doors in
the morning fast lock'd as she left them over night; So
also her Cheeses and meat were often carried out of one
Room into another, whilst the doors were fast lock'd,
and sometimes covey'd into the Orchard.</p>
            <p>Then the Tenant having set Cabbidg-plants in her
Garden, in the night the Plants were pull'd up, and laid
in several formes, as Crosses, Flower-de-luces, and the
like, she caus'd them to be set again, and the Ground
finely raked about, to the end they might see if any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
might be discovered in the morning, when the
Plants were found pull'd up as before, and no track or
footstep to be found or perceived; The Plants were set a
third time, and then they continued unmoved.</p>
            <p>She had in her Cheese chamber many Cheeses upon
Shelves and a Bag of Hops in the same Room, one night
the Cheeses were all laid in the Floor in several formes
and the Hops all strewed about the Room, and the
Chamber door found fast lock'd in the morning.</p>
            <p>Another night in the Buttery there were several dishes
of cold Meat left upon a hanging Shelf, in the morning
the Tablecloath was found orderly laid on the Floor, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60739:2"/>
the dishes set on it, and most of the Meat eaten, onely
a manners bit lese in every Dish; yet there were silver
Spoons which lay by the Dishes and none of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish'd.</p>
            <p>At another time she had left half a rosted Pig, which
was design'd for breakfast next day, when the Pig was
call'd for, there was not one bit of either Skin or Flesh
left, but the Bones of the Pig lay orderly in the Dish,
and not one of them unjoynted or misplac'd.</p>
            <p>Whilst these and many other such pleasant tricks were
play'd in the Rooms that were lock'd to make a discovery
of any deceipt, if possible, the entrance of the doors
were all strew'd with sifted ashes, and no footstep or track
of any thing was found in the morning, when such pranks
were play'd in the Room.</p>
            <p>One night the Tenant having bought a quart of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
in a Bottel, she set it in her Dairy-house, where there
was six Cows Milk, In the morning she found her Bottle
empty, and her Milk all turned and made into a perfect
Posset, with the Vinegar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And the Cheeses were sometimes convey<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by night
out of the Cheese-chamber, and put into the Trines of
Milk in the Dairy-house.</p>
            <p>The Tenant had likewise divers of her Cattel that
dyed in a strange manner, among others a Sow that leap'd
and danc'd in several unusual postures and at last fell down
dead.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hagg</hi> having thus for above a moneth together
almost every night acted the part of <hi>Hocus pocus Minor,</hi>
lay quiet for some moneths, and then began to act the
<hi>Major</hi> and do greater mischiefs; and to this purpose, one
night as the Tenant and her Maid were going to bed, and
passing by the Hall, which was dressed with green boughs,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60739:3"/>
tyed on the Posts, after the Countrey fashion, they were
all of a flame, and no fire had been made in that Room
of a fortnight before, nor any Candle that night; but
the fire was soon quenched by throwing water on it, yet
an outcry being made the neighbours came in and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the House all night.</p>
            <p>Not long after a Lost of Hay, dry and well Inned,
was set on fire in the day time and was most of it burnt,
with the house it lay in, and no way could be found how
it should come to pass, but by the same black hand.</p>
            <p>And after some time a Mow of Pulse and Pease was
likewise fired in the day time and all the grayn either burnt
or spoiled, and in the middle of the bottom of the Mow
were found dead burnt Coales, which in all the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
Judgements could not be convey'd thither but by
Witchcraft.</p>
            <p>After these dreadful fires, which did endanger the
whole Village had they not been at length quench'd by a
numerous company of the Neighbours, who came in to
the Tenants assistance, the poor Tenant dirst stay no
longer in the House, but quitted it, with all her losses,
when one <hi>Iohn Iones</hi> a valiant Welchman of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood
would needs give a signal proof of his Brittish
Valour, and to that purpose undertook to lye in the
House, and to incounter the <hi>Hagg,</hi> to which end he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him a large Baskethilted Sword, a Mastive Dog
and a Lanthorn and Candle, to burn by him; he had not
long lain on the Bed with his Dog and Sword ready
drawn by him, but he heard great knocking at the
Door, and many Cats as he conceived came into his
Chamber, broke the Windows, and made a hideous
noise, at which the Mastive howll'd and quak'd, and
crept close to his Master, the Candle went out, and the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60739:3"/>
Welchman fell into a cold sweat, left his Sword unused
and with much a doe found the door, and ran half a Mile
without ever looking behind him; protesting next day
he would not lye another night in the House for a hundred
pounds.</p>
            <p>I have omitted one Passage worth relating, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
upon a Friday night about <hi>Midsomer</hi> had bought a
dish of Strawberies, which she set up in a pewter dish in her
Buttrey for next day, when she looking for them, found
both dish and Strawberies gone, they searched for them
all Saturday and found neither dish nor Strawberies; on
Munday morning, when the Tenant was rising from her
Bed, she found the dish on the Beds foot, but no Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries.</p>
            <p>Now Sir there is as yet no discovery what <hi>Feind</hi> 'tis
that has acted these Vilanies, but 'tis believed time will
do it.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were thus acted hundreds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
both Ministers, Gentlemen, and others, came to the
House to see and hear the passages.</p>
            <p>These Particulars, with many others omitted, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from eye Witnesses of unquestionable credit, and
reputation, and you may no more doubt the truth of them,
than distrust the affection of</p>
